Anna was not the main character, and they made her seem like the main character, there wasn't one dialogue of Elsa. It seems like a very childish movie, with 90% comedy and it seems like again a prince saves the day. I didn't saw the trailer of Frozen until now, my brother showed me Frozen and from that day I became it's fan (I was already a Disney fan but I didn't saw the trailer). And I have to say to Disney, I'm very disappointed.",0,0,Akansha's Little World

2020-04-10T22:51:03Z,"And here is the first official trailer for the film that has been extremely successful that it launched a beloved franchise! I can't believe it's been just over six years since it debuted, and in that short space of time, we have been given two shorts and a full-length sequel which has grossed even more than the original! Some of the moments in this trailer seem a bit misleading by shortening lines of dialogue, and also saying lines and showing scenes that are not in the theatrical version of the film. But I tell you, Disney made an excellent move to keep Hans's true nature a secret from audiences by captioning him as ""The Nice Guy"" in this trailer! 😆  This trailer may have seemed a bit cheesy at first and maybe gave the impression that Frozen wasn't gonna be any good...but we all got the surprise of our lives when it received widespread critical acclaim AND became the highest grossing film of the year! 😁😄 In fact, until its successor, Frozen was the highest-grossing film by WDAS since The Lion King! 😁👍🏻  Disney, THANK YOU for giving us Frozen and all of its short film/feature length sequels! 😁😄👍🏻",0,1,HAFanForever

So obviously they saw Tangled's trailer and figured ""hey, let's do it again only with ""The Snow Queen"" instead of ""Rapunzel""...only barely mention Elsa outside a side comment that the ""threat"" is the heroine's sister who is going to be the show-stopper.

Treated it as a comedy with pauses for gags/one-liners instead of what you would expect from a Disney Renaissance movie trailer from the 90s. If you watch these trailers, they capture the tone of the movie seriously but amazingly and with Mark Elliott's narration.   Not the mention of stock pop music that sounds like a commercial.   Again, the pausing the music for comedy in forms of gags and one-liners doesn't make a trailer work especially by Disney standards    Good thing the second official trailer of the 2013 movie captured the tone perfectly (with the use of one of the film's songs), and the use of comedic one-liners got toned down a lot (only for Olaf).

2019-06-29T07:33:44Z,"Here are my thoughts on the movie:   When I first saw this movie in cinemas I was blown away and really impressed! But then I saw the film again recently and I didn’t have the same experience - far from it. Instead, I was really bored, and this lack of investment drew my attention to the problems with the film. I felt like this movie lacked a sense of adventure; the characters don’t travel that far, they don’t come across that many obstacles and conflicts, and the climax feels like it arrives really soon. It’s a very short and uneventful journey to me. This makes the movie very underwhelming.   It also doesn’t help that the pacing comes across as way too rushed. The movie darts and bounces around its scenes at hyperactive speed. This supersonic style of storytelling creates *gaping* plot holes, because the film isn’t interested in explaining certain elements - it’s too busy whizzing past to the next scene. Details feel missing and ideas go unexplored, so I started raising questions like “Where did Elsa’s powers come from?” “How can Elsa harness her powers one second and then master them the next?” “And why was Anna locked in the castle too? She doesn’t have dangerous powers.” Plus many others that I can’t dive into without revealing spoilers. These plot holes make it hard to connect to the movie and understand what’s going on half the time. I wouldn’t mind all these plot holes if I was at least having fun, but I wasn’t! I was bored!   Now, many people will defend these plot holes with “It’s Disney Logic.” But the film clearly wants to subvert Disney ideas, tropes and traditions by playing around with audience expectations. How can the film be effectively subversive when it’s using Disney logic as a crutch? You can’t challenge your old-fashioned traditions *and* use them to get away with bad storytelling. It contradicts your intent! I don’t even see Disney logic as a warranted excuse for bad storytelling either; there should never be an excuse to half-ass your narrative or assume audiences are too stupid to notice plot holes. The film’s decision to be subversive *and* faithful to Disney traditions make it seem like it’s treading on egg shells - it wants to be revolutionary, but it doesn’t want to break the mold too much. If you’re going to subvert Disney movies, then why not go all the way? Nope! Disney wants to hold mummy’s hand while dipping its toe in the water.   In addition, I honestly don’t think that this film handles its theme of sisterhood very well. The rushed pacing means that we don’t get to see Elsa and Anna spend many moments together, as adults and as kids, so there’s a sense of weight and development missing from their sibling relationship. Frozen’s message of sisterly love comes across as a forced theme thrown into the film without any passion, which makes their sentimental moments seem contrived.   As for the characters, Anna is a bouncy and optimistic woman. I like how cheery, active and energetic she is, but her naïveté can get aggravating now and again. Sure, she’s been trapped in a castle for a very long time, but surely the castle servants could’ve taught her better common sense, or introduced her books - something to give the poor girl some intellect! Also, like I said, it makes no sense as to why Anna was locked in the castle too, considering that she’s not the one with dangerous powers! It’s like the filmmakers only wanted to recluse her to contrive a reason for her naïveté, which is forced character development!  To be honest, I couldn’t care less about Elsa and I wasn’t that engaged in her character arc. Sure, she’s had a tough life, but she doesn’t really do much except run away, shut people out and start an enteral winter! She doesn’t even try to stop the eternal winter she started! She just keeps whining “I can’t,” without even making an attempt! Now, some people do react to conflict by doing nothing or running away, but it’s not interesting watching someone do nothing! Especially for a visual medium like a movie! It makes her boring and a hindrance on the progression of the plot!   Kristoff is nice. Just nice. He’s pleasant, likeable, helpful and has a sweet friendship with his pet reindeer. That’s all there is to him though! He just seems to be in the film to serve as another possible romantic interest for Anna. But even that idea lacks weight because there’s not enough chemistry between them both - they come off more as just friends than potential lovers.   Olaf is magical snowman created by Elsa. I will admit that his incessant positivity can become grating, but sometimes he does provide some funny, dry humour! It’s interesting seeing a comic relief character that’s quiet and nuanced, rather than loud and chatty.   Hans might seem like your typical Prince Charming, but there’s a twist to his character. I won’t spoil what it is, but when I first saw it, I was so shocked! But then I watched the film again and started noticing little holes in the twist. This made the twist less believable and more like a cheap gimmick only there to surprise first-time viewers.   I really don’t like the trolls. They’re presented as cute, adorable and charming! But I don’t think they are. They come across as loud, annoying, irritating, obnoxious, shallow and kind of creepy!   As for the animation and visuals, this is a very pretty movie. The environments are beautifully unique, Elsa’s magic effects are stunning to look at, and the costumes are gorgeous! The snow is also used to its advantage to sprinkle scenes with delicate softness. The character animation is just decent though. It’s a good effort, but certainly not up to Disney’s usual standards to me. There’s a sense of timing, rhythm and expressive personality, but I get the impression that the animators are holding back a bit. That distinctive Disney energy and charisma seems to be watered down slightly - it’s not bad character animation, far from it, just not that great or memorable. The studio can do much better than this.   Finally, there’s the music. The music for this film is either unnoticeable because it’s so bland and generic, or over-the-top to the point where it sounds like it’s desperately shouting “Please be charmed by my whimsy! I’m a pretty pretty princess!” Now, I have mixed feelings about the musical numbers in this movie. I like some of them, but I also couldn’t care less about others. I think Let It Go is an overblown and melodramatic song that rushes the story forward way too fast, but I love the Nordic influences and marching rhythm of Frozen Heart! I can’t stand Fixer Upper because it’s a loud and irritating track that holds up the narrative and has lyrics that make me question the trolls’ values and morals. But I think Love Is An Open Door is a catchy and cute number with a fun pop melody! So yeah, the songs are a double edge sword for me.   To conclude, I think that Frozen is boring, melodramatic, rushed and clunky. It had potential, but it failed in its execution.",1,2,Unicorn Bunny

I mean, when you hear the same songs being sung over and over again, you're going to grow irritated at some point! The songs are good, but people were still singing them when I was in 6th grade. The movie came out when I was finishing 4th grade. In conclusion, no, the movie is not overrated, guaranteed some people say ""oh, it's better than The Lion King"" or ""Best movie of all time!"", that's all just opinions and there are thousands of movies out there, so many I bet you don't even know half of them exist!

2016-01-02T16:18:01Z,"After so many speculations regarding Anna and Elsa’s true identity, Disney finally revealed that “Frozen” will have its sequel. Following the blockbuster film and Oscar-winning Frozen is its sequel. Frozen 2 is yet to be released until 2018, but movie spectators already came up with a bunch of predictions.The first on the list is Anna’s change of character. Rumor has it that she will be a villain and will use her powers against Queen Elsa. With regard to the change of wardrobe, there’s already the new look for Anna and Elsa in the short film “Frozen Fever” so people expect something new for them in the sequel. The said musical fantasy short film revolves around Anna’s birthday party thrown by Elsa with the help of Sven, Olaf, and Kristoff. The seven-minute short film also received positive reviews as much as the movie did.Directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee told MTV News that the upcoming film will be another emotionally gripping story about two sisters. The sequel is also expected to highlight social issues. “I don’t think any of us take [them] lightly, even though they can be very funny and entertaining, the messages that our movies have and the influence they can have on young people. When the kids [watch] them, they watch them over and over again, and if we don’t have a decent message in there, I think we’ve missed an opportunity,” he said.Meanwhile, the biggest question right now is that “Will Rapunzel have a special appearance in the movie?”She allegedly has the same supernatural powers as Elsa, giving us the conclusion that they could be sisters. In the 2010 movie Tangled, Rapunzel was shown as a beautiful lass who can heal through her tears. She also has superhuman strength and superhuman adaptation like that of Ariel. This makes us wonder if Elsa, Rapunzel, and Ariel are all related to each other or if they are living in the same world? That’s something to watch out for. Disney has not released an official trailer, but Buck and Lee confirmed they are working on it since August 2015.",2,1,Arjun Ahir

2015-05-20T07:03:50Z,To bad this past year an animated film by DreamWorks Animation came out on November 26th 2014 originally it was supposed to come out on March 27th of this year but was moved up to November because they felt it would be easier for the film to stand out during the Thanksgiving and Holiday seasons but didn't make that much money. But it was still a pretty good movie for sure but not better than Frozen it's Penguins of Madagascar the spin-off of the Madagascar franchise. I give Penguins of Madagascar an A- and I give Frozen a straight A+. Penguins of Madagascar switched places with DWA's other film Home which originally was set to be released on November 26th 2014 but got pushed back to March of this year.,0,0,Jordan I

2015-05-17T19:19:49Z,"What if Elsa had nature powers? Reply to this comment with your version ofthe plot. It would be called Overgrown, here's the plot:   Elsa, Princess of Arendelle, possesses ecokinetic powers, with which she is able to produce or manipulate plants and earth at will. One night while playing, she accidentally injures her younger sister, Princess Anna. Their shocked parents, the king and queen, seek help from the troll king, who heals Anna and removes her memories of Elsa's magic. The royal couple isolates the children in their castle until Elsa learns to control her powers. Afraid of hurting Anna again, Elsa spends most of her time alone in her room, refusing even to speak to Anna, and a rift develops between the sisters as they grow up. When the girls are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.  When Elsa comes of age, the kingdom prepares for her coronation as queen. Among the guests is the Duke of Weselton, who seeks to exploit Arendelle for profit. Excited to be allowed out of the castle again, Princess Anna explores the town and meets Prince Hans of the Southern Isles; the two quickly develop a mutual attraction. Despite Elsa's fears, her coronation takes place without incident. During the reception, Hans proposes to Anna, who hastily accepts. However, Elsa refuses to grant her blessing and forbids their sudden marriage. The sisters argue, culminating in the exposure of Elsa's abilities in an emotional outburst.  Panicking, Elsa flees the castle, while inadvertently unleashing an eternal forest on the kingdom. High in the nearby mountains, she abandons her restraint, vowing to never return and building herself a solitary tree palace. Meanwhile, Anna leaves Hans in charge of Arendelle and sets out in search of her sister, determined to return her to Arendelle, end the forest, and mend their relationship. While obtaining supplies, Anna meets a gardenet named Kristoff and his reindeer, Sven, and convinces Kristoff to guide her up the North Mountain. On their journey, the group encounters Olaf, Anna and Elsa's childhood leafman whom the latter recreated and unknowingly brought to life, who leads them to Elsa's hideaway.  Anna and Elsa reunite, but Elsa still fears hurting her sister. When Anna insists that Elsa return, she becomes agitated and her powers lash out, accidentally striking Anna in the heart. Horrified, Elsa forces Anna, Kristoff and Olaf to leave by creating a giant leaf creature that chases them away from her palace. As they flee, Kristoff notices Anna's hair turning brown and deduces that something is very wrong. He seeks help from the trolls, his adoptive family, who explain that Anna's heart has been overgrownby Elsa. Unless it can be stopped by an ""act of true hope"", she will become a tree forever. Believing that only Hans can save her with his true hope that she will be alright, Kristoff races back with her to Arendelle.  Meanwhile, Hans, who is leading a search for Anna, reaches Elsa's palace. In the ensuing battle against the duke's men, Elsa is knocked unconscious and imprisoned in Arendelle. There, Hans pleads with her to undo the forest, but Elsa confesses that she has no idea how. When Anna reunites with Hans and begs him to show his hope for her to break the curse, Hans refuses and reveals that his true intention in marrying her is to seize control of Arendelle's throne. Leaving Anna to die, he charges Elsa with treason for her younger sister's apparent death.  Elsa escapes and heads out into the forest on the fjord. Olaf comes across Anna and reveals Kristoff has hope for her; they then escape onto the fjord to find him. Hans confronts Elsa, telling her Anna is dead because of her. In Elsa's despair, the falling leaves suddenly cease, giving Kristoff and Anna the chance to locate each other. Nevertheless, Anna, seeing that Hans is about to kill Elsa, throws herself between the two just as she turns into a tree, blocking Hans' attack.  As Elsa grieves for her sister, Anna begins to come back, since her decision to sacrifice herself to save her sister constitutes an ""act of true hope"". Realizing hope is the key to controlling her powers, Elsa reforms by removing the forest and helps Olaf survive in summer by giving him water. Hans is deported to the Southern Isles to face punishment for his crimes against the royal family of Arendelle, while Elsa cuts off trade with Weselton. Overjoyed, Anna and Kristoff share a kiss. The two sisters reconcile and Elsa promises never to shut the castle gates again.",0,0,Holly

2015-03-18T17:05:39Z,"One of the things I like most about Frozen is its respect for maturer audiences. Tangled had this as well. They had the characters speaking like normal human beings, they didn't add any cartoon sound effects (aside from the trailers), and they demonstrated different kinds of relationships than other Disney movies-- relationships between sisters, and relationships between parents and children (Tangled). Brave, while actually Pixar, not a musical, and subject to misleading trailers, also took risks in these categories, and I appreciate all three movies for it.",0,0,megamovieman101

There is no emotion or sadness in it that is rampant all over the actual feature. Frozen has some quite dark themes in it but you miss it if you only watch it once. For me it blew every other disney movie off the top shelf and that was without any hype. Its simply amazing. lol i have never been proud of being obsessed with fictional characters but Frozen changed all that.,1,0,Frozen Fan

I mean it gets annoying when people are saying things like,""do you wanna build a snowman?"" or ""let it go!"" every five minutes. One time I was at school, and this kid got super mad at this other kid for some reason during lunch, and the art teacher told him to just let it go and forget about it. And the WHOLE FREAKING CAFETERIA was singing Let It Go in like 5 seconds! Like yeah I get it, it was fun when it first came out, but its over now.  And WHY am I watching the video if I don't like it?

Since= good and possibly close to its predecessor Not better!!! That means Disney hasn't made a film that even came close after making the lion king. The only film that I can see that would be also is Brave but that's about it. The film became popular because of its passion and saying that no matter what family will always be there for you.

2014-08-14T12:55:55Z,"They could have done so much better with this movie. I was rather disappointed with the plot. As a fan of Hans Christian Anderson's work, I was expecting the plot to be closer to the Snow Queen book. I thought Kristoff & Anna were best friends (like Kai and Gerda) who were on a trip to Arandelle (because they have something to do there, idk). They got shocked when they found out that the kingdom was frozen because of an evil snow queen. Legend said, the queen lived in an ice castle on the North Mountain. Anna, the adventurous girl, decided to confront the queen. They could make a plot twist that Anna & Elsa were apparently sisters. Elsa ran away when she was little because her parents thought she was cursed. Anna only had a little memory of her & Elsa together (perhaps they could make Anna constantly having a blurry dream of her sister). That's basically how I thought the plot was like before I watched the movie._.",1,0,GEA

2014-08-10T11:13:46Z,"Honestly, Hans is one of the most pathetic and disappointing Disney Villains to ever be written. He isn't even a formidable villain. He is the least-threatening villain to ever grace a Disney film. Look at villains like Frollo, Scar, Ursula, Gaston and MALEFICENT. They're all threatening and sinister characters that will do absolutely anything in their power to get what they want. Hans, however, is an undeniably poorly executed excuse for a Disney Villain. The sequence at the start of the film, (Frozen), where Anna meets him shows how disappointing he is. Anna leaves for Elsa's coronation, he falls into the water and smiles, NOT SINISTERLY, consciously without anyone around to see. That is very misleading if he were a villain. All he can do is lock Anna in a room without any warmth? That is fucking unbelievable! Scar (The Lion King) murdered his own brother just to ensure Mufasa's reign as king would end. Gaston threw the person he fawned over and her father into an insane asylum to be locked there forever unless Belle agreed to marry him. Frollo was willing to kill the person who he'd been looking after for years. Ursula was scheming everyone and even tried to kill her fiancé, and a sixteen year old naive girl (mermaid, technically). Maleficent, well... -I don't think I need to explain her because she is the most malevolent and menacing Disney Villain ever and one of the greatest film villains in cinematic history. PERIOD. What does Hans have to show for himself? Does he look menacing? No. Is he as scheming as others? No. Is he a formidable foe? No. Is he at all threatening? No. He is none of those things. Easily one of the worst Disney Villains EVER. Frozen was an excellent movie, and Hans let it down, unfortunately. Hope ABC can make him better when he appears in OUAT, but I doubt it highly.

2014-08-04T03:42:47Z,"Gals... yes, the princess aspect could be seen as a fault of the film. Also, nearly every single character in the film is a male except for Elsa and Anna. Their mother, who dies, never even says a word in the film (wtf?). The only other female characters who speak are trolls, but the troll leader (chieftain?) is a male. (the king, the evil Duke, Olaf, Sven, Kristoff, the ice monster, the creep from Weasleton, the store salesman, etc etc etc etc etc.... all male). So yes, this film has its faults. Also, the fact the Elsa was originally planned to be evil totally creeps me out. But I can forgive those faults in light of how f-ing amazing and numerous the good parts of this film are. It's like when you're in love with someone, you don't mind their faults too much.... you totally forgive them. I might be in love with Frozen. This film truly warms my heart. Anna actually totally reminds me of someone I was in love with who touched me more deeply than anyone else ever has to this day. I know that's a lot of hyperbole... but I'm serious! And I'm 25, so I've been around the block a couple times. Now if they make a Frozen 2, they'd better put more female characters in there... I hate this idea that no one can enjoy a film about two women unless every other freaking character is male. If they screw it up with that one, I might be pissed. But I'll forgive it once.",1,0,Traves T

The other movies are better because they tackle on stuff on screen that we've not seen on an animation before. Yeah I get the whole sister relationship but come on the story is pretty weak and my pet peeve is that elsa can create life, is she like a god or something.

Let me explain.    First to all Frozen fans. You like the movie- ok there's nothing wrong but please as I know how you so much like it do not overrate it. Do not call it ""the best Disney movie ever"" because it is not. This is one of the reasons (probably the main reason) why so many people hate it. Frozen is a good movie but it can't be called ""the best Disney movie"". Why? Because it doesn't exist this kind of movie. None movie is the best or the worst. Even that my most favorite Disney movie is Lion King, I will never call it ""the best"" because it is not.     Now to all Frozen haters. You don't like the movie- ok there's nothing wrong but it gets wrong when you still care about it and you start insulting it. You are wondering why are there so many defencive fans? Because they protect something that they like. How would you feel if someone insults your favorite movie- bad, right? Let me give you an advice- ignore it. Just ignore the movie- nothing hard. You have different opinion- cool but what is the logic to complain how you don't like it. It doesn't make sense. Again- if you don't like the movie, just ignore it. ﻿",0,0,Venkidsa Zahariev

Anna is probably the cutest yet funniest Princess ever, she and Kristoff looks like the cutest couple i've ever seen in Disney movies, and Elsa, well, she's rather intriguing, she loves her sister so much and yet she doesn't want to build a snowman with her after one 'tiny' accident.

2014-05-24T17:11:17Z,"I really don't see why so many people think that this is a ""girlpower"" movie. In my opinion a girl-power or female empowerment movie should be about a strong woman or a woman that overcomes some difficulties and empoweres herself. Like Merida, Mulan or Pocahontas. Even though Elsa was the one that saved the day and broke the curse instead of a man (like every other film), I feel like that was just by chance and not her motive or plan during the movie. Elsa is obviously running away from her problems and Anna has no clue what she is doing. How is that being a ""powerful"" woman?  If Elsa was evil and trying to take control over the kingdom with her powers, and Anna was trying to stop her, and in the end succeding, now that would be a perfect portrayel of two powerful women. Throw in a wise old fairy to guide Anna, and there you have three.  Everyone is talking about Merida and Mulan, but even in Pocahontas we see a strong woman. The center is the movie is Pocahontas and John Smiths relationship which most people think is anti-feminist (because it centeres around a man), but she litterarly threw herself on John before her dad was executing him - saving his life, and was the one that convinced the men to stop the war. If that's not girlpower than I don't know what is..",36,25,Vladica Micanovic

I feel I relate to this movie more than any other Disney movie I've watched, therefore holds a special place in my Best Movies List, so it pains me when many people insult this movie with little reason, with a fairly big portion of them just joining in with the crowd, with some not even having watched the film. Those with their own actual reasons don't bother me at all. It won 2 Oscars and outlasted The Lion King as the longest-running animated film soundtrack for a reason. Of course we all have our opinions, but some of these comments just use the fact that to some it's ""overrated"" to hate the film. Yes, some people might have raised your hopes too high, so if you had seen the film when it had just released, I'm pretty sure your reaction would differ. But can't you appreciate the hard work Disney has done to make this amazing film and commend it's success before calling it a ""piece of ***""!? The progress they've made in animation to make amazingly realistic snow? I've never seen people attack a movie like this, which really astonishes me since Frozen is one of the least deserving movies for this kind of cruel judgement in my eyes. But if you feel mocking a children's film with a lack of true reason that brought countless smiles across the globe, then all I can say is ""let the storm rage on"" I understand most of these people are ""trolls"" but it really annoys me that when I go to watch a clip of one of my favourite movies, there are a bunch of comments leaving a false negative impression of Frozen to those who have yet to see the film.

This trailer has almost as many fake lines as the Iron Man 3 trailers and really lies about the movie's overall tone. The movie is a comedy-drama, focusing primarily on Anna (the redhead) and her sister Elsa (the one with ice powers), and the snowman doesn't even show up until halfway through (and he's much funnier in context than in these trailers).",0,0,Mr. Snrub

Normally with these movies you can predict what happens, but this one had quite a few tricks up its sleeve. That's good, because you don't want the same stale story being retold.

2014-03-29T04:00:19Z,"I have to say, this movie is really overrated (it's just a good movie, not a great one). They pulled a Randy Newman with the show tunes, which should not be done unless said songwriter is Randy Newman. Speaking of which, so many damn show tunes, most of which come off as more of a distraction (moat notably Olaf's song) rather than flowing with the story. Also, Christophe Beck is not that great at show tunes. Why didn't they get Hans Zimmer, Alan Silvestri, Alan Menken, Mark Mancina, or a number of others to make the music instead?  Not to mention that the guy that comes closest to a villain would have been so much better of one if they made him a Conduit (that's what I'm calling those like Elsa) like Elsa, but one with power over fire. I mean, there would have been a perfect inFAMOUS reference right there: ""Did you think that you were the only Conduit in the world? There are hundreds, maybe thousands more just like us."" Then an epic battle between fire and ice could have ensued. It also would have left so much room for a sequel, with a lightning Conduit voiced by none other than Eric Ladin.  Kristoff is a main character but he's treated more like a side character. He's the glue. Without him, both Anna and Elsa would be dead.  Kung Fu Panda 2 is a much better movie. Come on, Disney, you used to be the best, but KFP2 is still much better than most, if not all, the stuff you've been producing in recent years.",3,0,Hanskah

It showed the importance of family, the bond between mother & daughter, creating your own destiny, independence, accepting each others differences, and not conforming to societies ideals (Mulan could also fit into the category of female empowerment).  When Merida won the archery tournament (for her hand in marriage) she was telling her parents that she will decide her fate. How much more empowering can that be?

Anna is cute and charming and all, but Elsa is the real beauty and will melt your heart. With the relatively complex characterization and unique personality compared to other Disney character. Not to mention she defined the whole movie with her 'Let It Go' scene. TL:DR, Anna is just following along the story, but it's Elsa that endured the beginning until the end shaping the plot of the movie. Frozen should have centered around Elsa, not Anna. ",0,1,AQHackAQ

But that's not at all what the movie is about, Elsa isn't evil AT ALL! And her sister isn't going to defeat her, but to help her. There's only one bad guy in the movie and ironically he didn't even show up in the trailer! xD  haha okay, but the story and the characters and just everthing is excellent! really really loved it!

I mean sure, it's almost like copying Rogue in X-men and that the white hair strand is the bad memory from the past, but hey, it happened, that's not going to change because of the hair strand, and it's cool, so they can keep it. I mean, I know that the ""cure"" is supposed to cure everything, but that's for the heart, not the head. The head was healed and she still has it, ugh, whatever. Doesn't bother me that much I guess. I would like this movie if the trolls gave Anna her memory back of her older sister having magic ice power when they were younger I guess, I'll be fine with that then. Since Anna now knows about it, her knowing is not going to harm her anymore, so her old memory being gone is not helpful anymore.",0,0,FireStormBaller

2014-02-17T18:21:06Z,"Um, the only thing I have against Frozen, is that it seems that the Feminists sort of took over Disney. Disney is too focused on making the female characters powerful and sort of form the ""I can do anything a man can do"" attitude into them. Although this is nice, Disney focuses too much on it, and leaves their male characters undeveloped, and often, stupid. If a man falls down in the snow, and a woman helps him, the Feminists cheer, and if a woman falls down in the snow, and a man helps her, the Feminists turn into lions, ready to tear up Disney. The fact is, Disney is afraid of what the Feminists will do, and because of that, focus too much on making the disney princesses less..... Graceful, or whatever you would call it.  Why is it bad for a man to help a woman? I totally support the feminist cause, but they're too weird about stuff. A man can't even ask a woman to do the dishes without the feminists jumping all over the dude.",51,17,Blue Madness

I didnt watch because the trailer looked boring. However a friend of mine took his daughter to the theater to watch this, and himself really enjoyed it, and recommended it to me.  Very touching movie.. shows people romance isnt everything.. i think this was the only disney movie that i have seen that made me think about it day after day..

Right from the start she just looked like an obnoxious ditz who just yammered on and on and showed barely any sympathy or emotion, only cared about getting the guy and nothing else, and was more like ""Ugh, my dumb sister, like, just froze the kingdom and, LIKE, ruined my chance to find a guy, UGH!"" than having even an ounce of love for her own sibling or any other human being (the moment with Olaf and the fireplace felt like too little too late). I mean, at least Olaf had his assembling/disassembling body that was cool/funny to watch, but all this character seemed to be was an annoying spoiled brat. Truly goes to show the power of trailer editing: I was genuinely and pleasantly surprised by how generally sweet and likable she was in the film itself (same goes for most of the main characters).",26,22,Andrew Brinkerhoff

It would've been amazing if the Princess's true love was the Delivery guy and finding true love was the key to controlling the ""power"". And also, The Queen was portrayed as a villain throughout the movie and I didn't really like that because she didn't deserve it. But I'll be expecting an Frozen 2.",0,0,Titxnium-_-

2014-01-01T07:21:03Z,"Hey guys, I just watched the Disney movie FROZEN and i'm not satisfied on how it ended. You see, Elsa is sitting in the throne without a king. I would like to tell you that i have a suggestion of making a sequel to the FROZEN movie, which can be named as FROZEN 2: Untold Stories ,or something like that. It's gonna add a twist to the story but not really ruin it because you see, it takes place in the kid days of Elsa, you know, locking herself inside her room and nobody knows what really happens. If you liked this idea, especially to the people who knows a member of the Disney Channel , please refer this to them and I don't care if they edit this of do anything to it, ignore it perhaps, but I would really like to see Elsa with her true love. So here it goes:  Once upon a time, there exists a Legend whom only the wise ones know, that babies born in the first hour of the 1st of December will be granted a rare power, which is the ability to control ice. There were two kingdoms which were birthplaces in this rare time, the kingdom of Arandelle and the kingdom of _______(Put a good name of a kingdom).(Put a scene of the queens giving birth to the babies) The first one was Elsa of Arandelle and the other one was ____(put the name of the prince). (Put a scene of the two growing up until they become 7, perhaps) After 7 years (This is where the story starts focusing in the life of the Prince)(Put a scene about a queen giving birth to another baby with the prince and the king looking and naming him Kristoff, and the queen telling the prince to take care of his little brother)(Optional: Also put a scene of the queen of Arandelle giving birth to Anna). But there was a great difference on how the two treated their powers. Elsa chose to hide her power because of the tragedy that traumatized her while the Prince, opn the other hand, accepted his powers to use them for good because of his heroic deed that saved his brother, Kristoff (Put a scene scene similar to Elsa and Anna playing but has a different outcome, which ended with the prince saving Kristoff)(Also put a song perhaps, about the prince being glad with his powers). (Transition)(Put a scene about Kristoff having his birthday and the Prince giving him the gift that he always wanted, his pet reindeer Sven).(Put a scene where a five-year old Kristoff gets fed up being a prince because he has to follow the rules and he wants to see the world out there, with a song perhaps). The story goes on with Kristoff, secretly packing his things and getting ready to escape the castle, being seen by the guards, but were too late ta catch him. The message gets to the Prince immediately and he went out of the castle to search for his brother. In the kingdom Arandelle, when Elsa traps herselp in her room, she eventually gets bored and gets out by the secret door. She does this frequently to view the world, until one day, she encounters a pack of wolves staring at her. By coincidence, the prince saw the scene and decided to stop to help and saying that Kristoff will have to wait. He lures the wolves with something (I can't think of anything for him to lure them at this time, just edit this but don't make him use his powers for that will be an important scene later on)(Put a scene with the prince saying to himself that he can't show his powers yet) . After doing that, Elsa walks to him and thanks him, intrducing themselves to each other and having fun and also telling the prince that she will have to marry Nash (By parental means, also Nash can be a brother of Hans) and she is not happy if it goes that way (Put a filler scene here). They promised each other that they would be friends and the meet each other every morning.(Put a scene about Kristoff telling himself to forget everything about him being a prince and he sees the men getting ice, the ones shown in the start of the FROZEN movie, and decides to join them. (Put some scene with Elsa and the Prince having fun, can also be accompanied by a song).(Time: On their Birthdays) The story continues with Elsa and the Prince as teenagers and Elsa decides to tell him her secret. The prince also thinks of the same way, but he says that ladies should always go first. Elsa shows him her ability and by telling the prince, he is quite shocked but he does not show it in his face. He eventually says ""Looks like your not the only one"" and also shows her his power. Elsa is shocked and asks him how his people accepted him. Both tell each other about their kid stories, Elsa's tragedy and the Prince's Heroic Deed. Elsa is also shocked that the prince can control his powers by not freezing the rose that he touched to give to her. He then explains it by singing the song Let It Go, which is slightly different in Elsa's Version, because of the changed lyrics, Elsa singing some of the song's lyrics, and also the prince making a castle for Elsa, which he disintegrates later on. Elsa also tries to control her power, but fails to do that because of her missing friendship with Anna. She goes back to her castle to see her sister, but is interrupted by the king and queen talking to her about her marriage to Nash, which is Hans's brother. She then rejects and tells her parents about the boy that she met (without really telling them everything, she only tells them about a man that will love her more than Nash will do, because she thinks that Nash is arrogant). Nash is secretly listening to this and this angers him, thinking of a plan to take away the prince for good. He then puts a poster on the tree that Elsa always goes to (the tree that she encounters every time that she goes out of her castle) and in the poster says that there is a white witch that has a gem that can help her control her power. Nash then puts directions until it reaches on the top of the cliff, which is a trap. Unfortunately, Elsa believes this and tells the Prince about it, and the Prince joins her on the journey (Put some filler scenes here) until she reaches their destination. There stood a house (Which is not really a house, just the front design of it and nothing in the back except Nash and his soldiers waiting) Outside, The Prince finally decided to propose to Elsa which was interrupted by Nash changing his voice like an old woman saying ""Are you coming in?"". The two comes in and is surprised in seeing Nash and the soldiers. Nash quickly grabs a knife to the prince's neck and blackmailing Elsa that if she will not marry him, he will take out the life of the Prince. (Nash quickly makes the prince unconscious for him to not use his magic. Elsa sadly says yes but it still ends sadly with Nash throwing the Prince in the cliff for good (or bad, as I say) and Elsa shouting until the guards also makes her unconscious. Nash quickly takes her back to Arandelle, telling the king and queen heroic stories that he made up but Elsa wakes up and tells her parents about what Nash did and her parents decided to go to Nash's kingdom to imprison him. (Setting: On the boat where her parents went to) The king, queen, and some bodyguards went to the boat while Nash stayed in Arandelle in his temporary prison.(transition) The Prince who fell off the cliff woke up floating in the water under it (Luckily, it was water) but at freezing temperatures. The prince also has a power disease when he is on water and he can't use it now so he just swims until there is a great thunderstorm coming his way and he catches sight of the ship that the king and queen stayed on. He also witnesses that boat crash and in contrary to the first movie, the people on the boat were saved by the prince and he brought them to a nearby island with ice. The king thanked him and told him that he is a worthy prince for Elsa. They started to build a boat from the resources in the island.(took them a long time)(they finished building the boat when Elsa loses control over her power)(to relate to the first movie). After the boat is completed, before the king can even step on it, a large snowstorm (the one that Elsa accidentaly created) destroyed the boat and froze the water and before the king and the queen can lose hope, the prince recalled his duty, that is to use his powers for good, no matter what it costs him. That is what made him use his powers to make an ice ship which is larger and more durable than the other one. Then, he defroze the water in the ocean for them to travel safely. This reminds the king of his daughter, Elsa, and decides to go back to Arandelle because she is more important than their mission. (Back to Arandelle) Elsa is sitting in her chair and acts unsatisfied because she lost her family and greatest friend. A kid near the docks sees the ice ship, and asks Anna if her sister, Elsa, created such a contraption. She hurriedly goes to Elsa and asks her about it, but she knows nothing about the ship. The ship then stops and the king and queen stepped out of the ship. All the people rejoiced and Elsa was really happy to see her parents alive and well. She then asks them about the ice ship and they told her that it was made by the prince who saved their lives. The prince stepped out of the ship and Elsa was overjoyed to see him. He then said that he would complete his sentence (The proposal that he didn't finish because of Nash) and Elsa happily accepted his offer. He then catched sight of Kristoff, his long lost brother and becomes relieved. And there goes the ending.(Put some scene like Elsa and the prince singing a duet of Let it Go).  Thanks for reading! Again, If you liked it, please refer it to someone you may know that works for Disney.",0,1,linocrusher
2014-01-01T04:08:15Z,"The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best of them.

2013-12-16T06:45:54Z,"I don't want everyone too get upset at as to what I have to say, but I really didn't like this movie. I thought it was actually kind've lazy and didn't bring anything new to what I've seen in animation. I mean yes, there were some good parts like the opening ice harvest song and Let It Go, but besides that I was extremely frustrated when watching it. I'll give you three points as to what I mean by that:  First, I feel like the movie wasted a big opportunity with the material it had when it came to its characters. This movie should've focused more on the story Elsa instead of her sister Anna. Elsa was the most psychologically complex character in the movie while Anna was too simple and mediocre to watch. Instead of making Elsa a disturbed character with different types of emotions, Disney decided to simplify her and make her a weak apologetic coward (except for the Let It Go scene, however by the end of that, she returned back to her normal self). Wouldn't it have been great to see her get mad once and do something bad on purpose, while trying to fix it by changing herself later?  Second, the theme of love is really over exaggerated in this movie. The relationship between Anna and Kristoff was the main story of the movie, which meant there was a lot of build up and focus on their love. Heck even the scene where Kristoff asks for advice from the trolls, there is a frickin song they sing that is dedicated to them to fall in instead of the trolls getting to the point and telling him how to break the curse on Anna. Also, when Elsa realizes that love is what can make her break the curse on her sister, there is no payoff because the entire focus of the movie was the love between Kristoff and Anna not the love between Anna and Elsa.   Finally, the animation was one of the poorest parts of the movie for me. I mean forget everything that dealt with ice, and you could see that every other animated scene in this movie was bland and forgettable from the mountains to the kingdom. One of my gripes with 3-D animation is the lack of attention to detail it contains. Everything is either white or a cardboard cut-out in this movie. Not one scene having to deal with ice did not engage me or keep me visually immersed. If you don't know what i mean, watch Beauty or the Beast or Spirited Away and then try to compare this to them.   Overall, the movie felt lazy and very lacking. It felt more like a cash grab than an actual effort from Disney, who is considered to be the kings of animation. I know maybe I sound a little too harsh, but I am an animation enthusiast and I expect better from one of the most financially successful companies in the world.",10,7,TheDrmcvey

2013-12-10T21:14:12Z,"(SPOILERS ALERT) The personalities and characters were interesting, but it lacks a true villain. The older sister sort of counts as a villain/victim, but that makes the story a bit bland, especially for a fairytale. Even the writers knew they lacked a villain so they just all of a sudden turned the nice prince into a villain.  I think the songs were not necessarily ""too much"" but they were over done. What I mean by that is songs should basically enhance the atmosphere of the place and enhance the personality of the people they are showcasing. The trolls for example, they already hammered the fact that they are neurotic and very nosy. Perhaps they should have started the song right when they revealed themselves to the younger sister that was dying, and not half way through a dialogue that already showed their personality.  I think this movie lacked genuine artistic touch, it seems to be made entirely from scientific formula on how to make a disney movie.",0,1,MasterMinda1025

2013-12-10T02:51:15Z,"I brought my niece to see this movie. This movie was extremely underwhelming. I was not impressed at all:  The animation was absolutely stunning, as was expected, but the story and plot are weak. The characters were two dimensional, and a few were totally unnecessary (I'm looking at you Snowman dude). The songs were very forgettable, with the exception of three...Build a Snowman, Let It Go, and the one the Prince and the main protagonist share as they were falling in love (Opening Doors, or something like that). All other songs were re-hashed unimaginative carbon copy cookie cutouts you'd hear from a bad low budget children's cartoon which goes direct to video.  Furthermore there were way too many of them.  The movie might have been interesting if the entire thing were a musical...you would only need another twenty minutes of music if this were the case. In the music department specifically, I expected a lot better quality.  Admittedly, the scenes with the two sisters as children were adorable. The banter between the ice collector guy and the main protagonist princess/little sister chick was actually funny...however if you want that kind of thing done better just watch Tangled (which was a fabulous movie). When the cliché morals and weak story progression wasn't taking place, it was making very shallow and unhealthy statements about true love and relationships which seem to imply the writers know nothing of the subject outside of reference material not too dissimilar to Archie Comics...or My Little Pony.  There is a slight twist nearing the end of the movie which is truly surprising, but only because it's so unexpected.  Overall I would not suggest watching this Disney animation, nor owning it when it comes out on DVD.  If your daughter/niece/child/etc bugs you to go see this  movie because the commercials tell them they have to...then this movie is okay to watch (it's not like they can truly grasp or appreciate the movie's lacking morals anyway...they'll just think the princess and queen are pretty and they sing well). Just be prepared for a long, awkward...and frigid journey through a mystical winter wonderland of boredom.  6/10",9,14,vjm3

With all the special effects, the snow and ice, the saturated colors, the way the light reflects and refracts..these things are showcased perfectly through this form of digital art. Hand-drawn animation simply could not have created the same quality of detail. Whether it's on paper or through computer graphics, these are just mediums for storytelling. The story's importance is first and foremost; the visual aesthetics are secondary. Frozen was an outstanding film with beautiful animation, great characters, and a moving story. We need to accept that we've entered an age where CG is the new frontier, and many of Disney's contemporary artistic endeavors match the talent, beauty, and authenticity of its predecessors.",1,0,Leslie Monster

This movie has just the right bit of drama and comedy . And we cant forget the music , to be honest hands down it was broadway worthy defiantly. The snow was so realistic and elsa's outfit ( ice outfit ) was stunning  ! Over all this movie was so captivating .

2013-11-19T15:41:33Z,"I have been thinking about this for a long time and after watching the new Disney movie, Frozen, I cannot keep this to myself anymore.  I watch a lot of animated movies because of the story line and the talent it take to do voice overs and animation.  While watching the preview of Frozen and with most of Disney animated movies I do not see any likeness of people of color.  Not only as main characters, but when you look at the background characters as I do, they are all white characters…as if they just duplicated the characters to save money.  How do you control the minority in the world, you control the message and this is what Disney has done for many years.  Everyone want to see some likeness of themselves when they go to the movies, its only human nature to expect that, but when you have one race controlling the message, you will only get the message of that race.  So…with that, Disney, this will hurt me…because I like the product you produce, but me and my family will no longer support anything Disney.  It’s time we as human being start seeing each other from the basic level as a human being and make a valid attempt to include the masses when you produce a product that you want to appeal to everyone.  I’m also asking all people of color to evaluate if they feel Disney is doing them justice in controlling the message that people of color cannot and do not have a place in the plot of the product they are producing.  When I see a Disney product that all the characters are white…all the way down to the background characters, the first thing I ask myself, is Disney saying you as people of color don’t have a place here and you do not live in a town or village such as this.",14,0,PVT Citizen

2013-11-08T19:27:20Z,"I shan't be seeing this in theaters. I already got the basic gist of the film  from the trailer. I'm tired... so sick and tired of this shit. I fucking hate almost everything about this film. I hate how they use the SAME fucking face model for all the female protagonists in their films... Christ even in Paperman it looked the same. I hate how soulless and forced, damn near everything is. I fucking hate how empty it's environment looks. And I REALLY fucking hate how almost every fucking animal, acts like a goddamned DOG...  I'm just about done with Disney films. Not just because they have completely forsaken hand-drawn animation, in favor of cheap CGI, but mostly because they don't put fourth any effort to give quality to the work. I mean, the people who did the concept artwork, that was INFINITELY better than what was shown here. It sickens me how they took this many steps back, when the concept was so promising. *sigh* kinda depressing since I know it's gonna be a hit, cause it's Disney... Brace yourselves, cause it's only gonna get worse form here. And unless something floors me, I won't bother with it. But, I'll still put it down, because I can enjoy that at least. Only animation movie companies worth supporting now is Dreamworks, and Pixar...  (Even though Dreamworks is a mixed bag, but excellent at times.) But even Pixar is beginning to lose it's once flawless quality. Brave was meh, and Cars is shit. They're trapped within their own franchises, they have to make sequels now, because they can't make original material fast enough, since all the films they were working on, that started from around 1995/1996, during that lunch meeting. (i think)  I just pray that none of them, get as bad as this. ",1,0,MrAnon00

Oh and the book the movie is based on (The Snow Queen) has mostly women cast in major roles with no love interest.  Disney changed most of them to guys...  And the wolves attacking the chariot bit is boring!  Why not some enchanted evil snowmen or some other off the wall creation from the queen herself?

2013-10-01T04:34:39Z,It may be similar to Tangled; Tangled's characters were a wining combination. But Frozen still seems like a quality animated move with a bit more story and character development than any of the other animated movies that released this year. Tangled was pretty fun and impressive and Frozen seems to be following the same good direction. Disney seems to have caught and passed the other Disney owned animation studio Pixar lately.

It had one little thing on the actual plot and that was it.
