In the movie Dragon' The Bruce Lee Story (1993) Won Jack Man becomes responsible for Bruce Lee's back injury, for in reality Bruce Lee did a bad barbell move when training his back. In this they make won a hero and Bruce a almost villain. Bruce was well know for his short temper, but in his life he was for every one a role model after his crazy years as a teenager, he had become a very respectful person. He was real competitive and mostly demanding on himself, but he was respectful for his teachers, something Dan Inosanto still tell his audience in seminars. So what is this movie. I believe that the fight between Bruce and Won might have been more then the Lee clan tends to tell I believe Won most probably gave a better fight, but that Bruce did win.  None were  seriously injured from the fight and Bruce won the respect of the Chinese community has a real Kung Fu teacher. This BIRTH OF THE DRAGON movie is mostly fiction and his a disgrace to the memory of the man and genius in his own way that Bruce Lee was.  Read the Tao Of Jeet Kune Do, do a few martial arts styles for a few years then practice some of the Jun Fan Gung Fu (The form of Jeet Kune Do that was taught in Bruce Lee's kwan). Then you will understand how much Bruce understood the human body when it came to the possibility of using it martial arts. Otherwise it is just gossip when it comes to judge Bruce Lee. I practiced mostly Karate and Taii Jutsu with some Japanese weapon. I would never give up on my Tai jutsu techniques, but my way is no way so I incorporate like JKD philosophy suggest. I did some Jun Fan Gun Fu, but for me reading the Tao of Jeet Kune Do was more instructive, yet practicing JKD was good for learning real sparring skills with some contact fighting. I would like to learn more of Jung Fan Gung Fu, but the schools are a little expansive in my region. Jumg Fan Gung Fu is a style, where JKD is a philosophy.

Basically, no chinese was allowed to go the usa unless they smuggled themselves across to hong kong and get on a plane to the states.  2)  Kung Fu or martial arts was not big during the 60s-70s because mao was telling every one to erase the old culture and embrace.  Basically the practice of kung fu was suppressed by communism 3) shaolin temple was not big in mainland china till Jet Li's Shaolin Temple in 1982.  Before 1982, years of communism have basically cleansed any followers of shaolin in mainland.  while, hong kong has maintained shaolin temple as some kind of rebel base for martial art practitioners, shaolin temple was practically dead.  Jet Li did an interview years ago about his experience of making the movie.  During the interview, he described the temple was practically emptied and no one was working there.   in conclusion, the idea of some shaolin monk can travel to the states freely and can knows kung fu is full of bull shit.

Bruce Lee did have an ego for a period but ultimately overcame his ego in later years. I just don't like the negative portrayal it seems to give to Bruce Lee. He wasn't fighting Won Jack to prove his new kung fu is better than the old (traditional) kung fu or to please his ego.

In the latter part of his short life he fully embraced Buddhist philosophy not just in Kung-Fu but in life in general. Watch some of his TV interviews you'll see confidence, not cocky arrogance.

ONE, Bruce taught white people and thus angered the Asian world.  The white guy is very much a part of the movie.  He is the ONLY white student we see (might be due to budget lol otherwise there might have been more), so he was probably to emphasize the dramatics of Bruce accepting the first white student. Bruce spent most his life in America.  I don't doubt that ""kick ass"" attitude brushed off on him. When Bruce studied under Yip Man, he had quite the playful attitude and spunk as a kid.  In his journal, he struggled to grasp the peaceful mind of gung fu.  All he could see was wanting to beat the other person (thus, kick ass).  Who knows if he fully grasp the gung ku peace of mind or if he did but then changed when he came to America?   So overall, the whole story was probably twisted by the media.  So why are we freaking out about a white man telling Bruce's story when that's probably what happened when he lived in where was it? San Francisco??

Martial Arts was the key to respect and discipline. Today asians are disrespected made fun of. We should never have taught non asians our discipline. We would be more greatly respected especially in the south. Good thing there are only a few master fighters left. Don't teach them the master arts.

Yet even now in death, Hollywood writers Christopher Wilkinson and Stephen Rivele, along with director, George Nolfi, give him similar treatment by dishonoring and rewriting his history, his philosophy, and his life. Bruce Lee was a philosophical man who faced racism as an Asian American and who overcame it with the strength of his abilities and personality. He wasn't some arrogant jerk who went around trying to ""kick ass.""

2016-10-04T06:58:51,"As a Hong Kong American, I agree there is an unfortunate element of whitewashing, as Hollywood never feels secure enough that a Chinese actor (or any asian actor) could carry a film to a successful box office as the lead role (heck not even TWO proven successful stars, such as Jackie Chan AND Jet Li together! Hence the white kid in Forbidden Kingdom). In an ideal world, Bruce would be the main character, not some caucasian no name disciple we couldn't care less about. The idea that white audiences are unable to relate to an asian main character and needs to view the asian experience through a white filter is frankly unacceptable in this day and age. Imagine if instead of Bruce Lee and his life defining fight, this biopic was about the circumstances around Ali and his fight with Foreman. Do you think having a white protagonist as the curating viewpoint would be ideal in that hypothetical film? If not, then this film's approach isn't either.   However, I do appreciate the casting choices for Bruce Li and Wong Jackman. Philip Ng is a rising martial arts star in the current (strinking) Hong Kong film industry. He is also a Hong Kong American, so coupled with his physical ability, he has the right circumstances to portray Bruce Lee. Yu Xia is a longtime legit serious actor from mainland China, like the equivalent of a Ben Kingsley or Liam Neeson before they sold out to shitty movies. Though he's not a martial artist like Ng, his reputation as a great actor makes him a prime choice to play a contrasting stoic, level headed monk. So at least they didn't botch the casting.  EDIT: Remember, guys, this is pre-JKD, pre philosophy self help book Bruce Lee. And also a commericial action film.

Now its telling that Bruce did not accept an offer of a rematch in front of an audiance. It can also be noted after the fight much of his philosophy and fighting style changed after that.  Finally were talking a grandmaster..the degree of training and skill to reach that level...Bruce Lee did not beat a grandmaster in 3 min no contest.

He said that when he met Bruce Lee he was nothing but a skinny, smart-mouth kid. Then, when Lee went to Hong Kong he came back a year or so later and he had all these muscles. Sifu said that muscles like that can't be made in a year. He was cocky. I saw a filmed interview with him and he was rather angry with every response during it. As the story goes, there was a TV program in Hong Kong. Several masters were invited as well as Bruce Lee. One of the masters was demonstrating how strong his horse was; no one could push him off of it or take him down. Bruce Lee came up and kicked the master in his face, turned around and said, ""I don't push, I kick."" That didn't sit him well with the other masters in Hong Kong. He was good at what he did. One of the people who knew him in Hong Kong and studied with Yip Man was Hawkins Chang. He has a whole different story to tell about Bruce Lee than what you've been hearing. In an interview with Charlie Rose all Jackie Chan said about Bruce Lee was that he helped his stunt group started in movies and made kung fu look like real fighting. That's it.

But first off if anyone is that mad what about dragon the bruse lee story he NEVER had his back broken. Second his whole mind state was a theory about martial arts which had stances which he belived to be slower than no stance and that he very aking breathe was to prove this. He died from smoking opium which he was allergic to. Also its gung fu not kung fu. gung fu means way of the iron bar. the one inch punch was done on jackie chan. There is rare footage of people challenging bruce. They did not win. the fights were less than 30 seconds. Bruce's only real challenge at the time was raceism. Sorry for my spelling. I dont think he was as arrogant as in the film which yes as an admirer i dislike BUT THERE IS YET A FILM TO DEPICT HIM. and as far as that guy said about a year showing up with muscles, dude ur a douche bag. He use do a ton of 1 finger push ups. try them before u say anything. I tried to do 10 and on th 6th i broke my finger.

2016-10-10T00:54:53,"From what I understand Bruce Lee took great pride in showing the realism of kung fu in his movies. He spent his life trying to show western cultures that there was more to eastern cultures than the stereotypical bull that hollywood was putting out. He was spiritual, philosophical and kind. He allowed anyone, no matter their race or creed to be taught kung fu in a time when it was unheard of in the Chinese community. Then he stopped teaching almost completely  (except for a lucky few) because he saw that people took his word as gospel when he was seeking innovation within his art. And if I also remember correctly it was this fight with a tradition Chinese monk that would determine whether or not he would be able to teach those who were outside of the community. And then he had to catch up to him because the monk ran away for three minutes until Bruce was able to catch him and beat him fairly easily. This movie takes so much away from the inspiring life of a man who was truly one of kind. This is a disgrace to everything that he had been trying to do for his culture, his art, and it is a disgrace to his legacy.

Perhaps this was the truth that was never shown or told. Perhaps some of the witness wants to redeem himself and tell the truth about what really happened.   Why else would Bruce turn into a philosof and deep thinker after that fight?  P.S, The story from Wong sounds way too much true. He always talked about eye strikes, ALWAYS. So, this is probably what happened. And the racist bullshit is done. Chinese have no problem teaching to white people as long as they are HUMBLE!  Wow this sounds way too much true, he did change his style after that fight. And Linda Lee is probably lying. I always thought her story sounded messed up. I never met someone that would run from a VT practioner, you jump back and check your distance. The chain punches are not too hard to handle, they are just annoying.

2016-12-19T15:19:18,"Yep, another reconstruction history that favorites China.  The reason Bruce had to fight Wong is because the Chinese martial arts teachers in San Fran doesn't approve Bruce is teaching ""foreigners"" Kung-Fu (back then it's a taboo).  So they force Bruce to fight Wong (their best fighter, who was trained in the arts of Shaolin) and made Bruce promised if Bruce loses, he would stop teaching foreigners.  Bruce of course said yes, but Wong insisted on a closed-door fight instead of open contest, Bruce again agreed to it.  What really happened remains a mystery as both sides claimed victorious, but the end result is Bruce continues to teach foreigners so it's pretty obvious he won.  However, after the fight against Wong it made Bruce rethink about his techniques and he created the slogan: ""techniques and forms are prisons of true Kung-Fu fighting"" and seek to mix East and West martial arts and create a new form of ""free flow Kung Fu"" which he later called ""Jeer Quan Dao"" (the preview made it seem like it was the monk that taught Bruce to go beyond technique, that is a blatant no as Chinese martial arts are rigid techniques and forms).",0,0,David C,vbNib_NsVRU,0.09037433155080213,2016-12-19 15:19:18,True,True

Most of the movies were B grade movies at best and not a single one was remotely close to actually portraying his style or his character and most of those have been around since the late 1970s and early 80s but no one's complaining about those trying to get those pulled off the market or anything else dot dot dot a man's reputation won't be squashed by a single movie it's so the hundred and forty movies that I've seen portraying to be Bruce Lee would have destroyed his memory by now... And also if this is about when Bruce Lee's first opened his first school around that point in time in his life he was known to be a little cocky and arrogant along with self-confidence and all. That was until he was injured and he re-evaluated himself and became more patients and more noble and more is the Bruce Lee that is embedded in all of our minds today...

Bob Bremer, aka the China Town Ass Kicker, told many colorful, amazing, and interesting stories about himself nd Bruce Lee. One of them was the infamous fight with Wong Jack Man. The real story is that Bruce began an evolution of his style after the Wong Jack Man fight and ended up creating JKD because of the limitations he had imposed on himself from his modified Wing Chun at that era of his evolution. The way Bob tells it, is that Bruce was amazed with Wong Jack..., amazed because he never met anyone in his life that could run backwards as fast as Wong was running, while Bruce was trying to chase him down with his straight blast!!! He told Bob, That Wong was flailing his arms in a backwards swimming motion, while running backwards and Bruce had a hard time catching him, and got out of breath. He eventually did catch him and beat him till he gave up. But it was this limitation of being able to get to Wong faster that got Bruce even more motivated to create the perfect style, and perfect himself into the perfect fighting machine.

Next, is it that difficult for Hollywood to stop white washing every movie that is supposed to have colored people in it, especially when it's about true living or dead people?? Take the story of Jesus for example and pretty much EVERY Bible character in every Biblical movie I have watched on Netflix and they are ALL white actors. Seriously Hollywood?? Fine, we've never actually seen Jesus, so paint him however you think he looks like, but a man like Bruce Lee, where EVERYONE knows what he looks like and 90% of people know what he did, you can't just promote a movie to make it look like it's about him and have him sidelined. He fought Hollywood on that when he was alive and this movie does the same thing again. I give it zero stars for misleading and the horrible ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" style of floating in the air. Something Bruce Lee stayed away from when directing his own films. Ok, I'm done.",0,0,TheDragonFayce,vbNib_NsVRU,0.0840952380952381,2017-04-10 14:20:05,True,True

Being a kshatriya Bodhidharma learned the skill of ancient Indian sword fighting, archery and melee attack skills. Within a few years Bodhidharma achieved mastery in all forms of ancient Indian martial arts and later after embracing Buddhism when he travelled back to China he combined all the deadly techniques of ancient Indian martial arts and create another new form of martial arts which combines some deadly combos of ancient Indian fencing, archery and melee attaking skiills. Later this form of martial arts became very popular among Shaolin group of Buddhism and came to be known as ""Kung-Fu"".
