2018-09-25T14:19:02,"Is it just me who is annoyed the way newt scamander holds and leans his head in many of his scenes? I didn't watch him in other roles as I recall, so I don't know if he does the same in other movies too but as if he holds and leans his head towards his shoulder while bending, lowering his head a bit . His head's position annoys me. It really is irritating. He doesn't hold his head straight like everyone else. Just watch his scenes carefully. You will understand what I'm saying.  Here is the best link you can see it: Second by second I analyzed it below. /watch?v=eh9QbjqbK4E&t=11s  For most obvious example, just look at the picture of the video just before you click it. That look, that position of the head...  In the video it is 0:27,  You don't have to burst your chin to your upper body 0:31 in this scene; this is exaggerated. (0:31 doesn't bother me that much though). It's just when countless of his head moves in the movie happen to be like in 0:27, scenes like 0:31 cut a swathe. Also in the video it is 0:33, when he gives a look while holding a blue beast. Look at his head, just look. It's not straight. 0:43, can't he just look down while holding his head straightly? I mean why doesn't he just bow down his fucking head towards the table in a straight way instead of bowing his head towards his right side? Does it have to be that way throughout the whole movie? 0:51, just why? Why disappear your neck and merge your head with your body and create wrinkles on your face when you have the chance to hold your head straight and do whatever you are told to with that creature while the camera is filming you from your left side angle? 01:08 again, look behind, closely and carefully just look at him. For example, watch the scene from the movie where he tries to catch Kowalski with his wand and gives up just after kowalski hit him with the suitcase outside the bank. He doesn't always slouch but his head moves whilst performing is really annoying.  I like Harry Potter series and this movie but this annoys me too much.",0,0,Kaan,8bYBOVWLNIs,-0.026114612511671347,2018-09-25 14:19:02,True,True

2018-09-25T14:24:30,"This looks pretty epic. I'd be surprised and find it odd if Tom Riddle doesn't show up before this series is over, and I think we will see that there was interaction between he and Grindelwald. Grindelwald is still nearing the height of his power and influence circa 1943, at which time Tom is 16 and already, in terms of skill, intellect and prowess if not yet global reputation, a master sorcerer, and is already in the process of horcrux creation (and just where and from whom did the talented Mr. Riddle learn horcrux making?? Even Slughorn didn't know the exact details, and all indicators are it was some of the most advanced and complex evil magic in the entire storyverse ). Beyond that, Tom is about 19 or close to it before Grindelwald is defeated and captured. 19 is a young man in pretty much every society, and the ""wizarding world"" confers full adult status at 17. Certainly, by the time of Grindelwald's capture, Riddle had already been operating as an extraordinarily efficient warlock, and getting everywhere he desired to go ( especially during vacation seasons ) for several years. Tom Riddle was the actual chosen ""champion"" of warlock-witch dominion that Grindelwald was REALLY looking for (Credence being more of a forerunner and anticipation of Riddle), and I think he will realize that before the series ends. Then there are the Rosier, Carrow and Lestrange connections, before we even start in on the MAJOR Nagini reveal. With all that in mind, and especially considering Tom's precociousness and brilliance, Tom's youth would have done nothing to deter Grindelwald from trying to form a mutually beneficial rapport with him. We've already seen Grindelwald mentoring and outright seducing a teenish Creedence Barebone, and Creedence was much less mentally advanced and massively less resourceful/capable than teenaged Tom Riddle, who by 16 was already murdering people, framing  and powerfully confounding an uncle, and masterfully manipulating seasoned and formidable professors like Horace Slughorn.  I think it is almost inevitable that some aristocratic high-school aged lackey of the mid-adolescent Riddle would have made it known to certain connected pure-blood parents/relations that they were in the inner circle of the heir of Slytherin; those relations would almost certainly have treated Tom like some manner of chosen one and come under his sway, and introductions to Gellert Grindelwald, whom they surely would have been secret supporters of, would then also have been inevitable. I don't think it is any mistake that the director of the final Potter films and the first Beast films had Grindelwald refer to Voldemort as ""Tom"" in their brief scene together in Hallows 1. The only people who called Tom by his birth name were people who knew him, and who were in a position of authority over him, before he took the Voldemort alias.",232,13,Gibran Lewis,8bYBOVWLNIs,0.1319708994708995,2018-09-25 14:24:30,True,True

Ewan McGregor and James McAvoy both put in the work and studied mannerisms and accents when preparing for prequels in Star Wars/X Men, with this I just don't see it. Maybe it was hard for them because they didn't know whether they wanted him to emulate Richard Harris' version or Gambon's - I think they probably should have just used Gambon's since he features in 6 more films.

Why are they all including Jacob Kowalski in Hogwarts at one point?   6. SPOILER ALERT: if Credence really is from the Lestrange family then how come Leta is dark skinned? Is her mom black?   7. How come Dumbledore is teaching defence against the dark arts? Was a sub teacher for 1 day?   8. Where did Grindelwald get the elder wand? Or is that Grindelwald with the elder wand? I mean I just assumed cause of the editing of the trailers but that could just be a red herring.   9. Is Grindelwald going to Azkaban or an american prison?   10.

(Side note: just because Amber Heard is also a piece of work does not make it OK for someone to abuse her.) He is *currently* facing charges for assault, is being sued by two of his former bodyguards, and his most recent movie has been pulled from release. I selfishly hope he is recast and will not be part of any future Fantastic Beasts films, so that I will be able to start watching them again. The sycophants (emphasis on ‘fan’ts – and I’m talking about people in his life) around Depp need to stop enabling his deeply disturbing behavior.

2018-09-26T06:38:59,"This trailer answered the question of how prisoners are transported to Azkaban. Because you couldn't use a portkey or apparate there. There is no mention of how they transport the prisoners there and I highly doubt that they would send him to Nurmengard as it is under Grindelwald followers control whilst he was away. Back to the topic. Thestrals make sense as to why they would be used as they are connected to death just like Dementors. Also I don't think that they would use a boat or brooms as a boat just doesn't fit and booms are way to small for such task.  Now few more questions. The scene with the Kelpie, (yes, it's a Kelpie. Not a Hippocampus.). On the wiki it says that Newt rode a Kelpie in '27. However in the trailer there is a part that is clearly from World War 2, Invasion of France more specifically (the BF 109 are quite recognisable) to that was 10 May - 25 June 1940 (46 days). Does this mean that this movie spans over 13 years? Or maybe it is a flashback? Or does he need to ride a Kelpie again. The only reason why he would need to ride a Kelpie again is if he either had to use it as 1. a mode of transportation (unlikely) or 2. he needs a Kelpie Hair which are used for wandmaking and it hasn't been revealed yet what is Newt's wand made of, therefore I can deduct that he somehow broke/lost his wand and needs a new one. Another clue that lead me to this is that Gervaise Ollivander, Garrick Ollivander's father, used lesser substance such as Kelpie Hair and Kneazle whisker. We do not know when Garrick was born apart from 25 September and before 1908. If he was born, say in 1900, he would have been only 27 in '27 and 40 in '40 which for a delicate trait as wandmaking, 9 years is definitely not enough, 22 years maybe. (Count in the fact that he would have left Hogwarts when he was 18, so 27-18 or 40-18) Anyways therefore I think that Garrick wouldn't have been the one to create Newt's wand. Rather Gervaise. Also, a wand can be created at anytime, preferably when the ingredients are still fresh. Such as Harry's and Voldemort's wands. They both use Fawkes' feathers and Voldemort got his wand in 1938, so Harry's wand was most like gathering dust in the shop for at least 52 years. This would also mean that by at least 1938, Garrick started to create his own wands.  As to why it will be set in Paris, it is very easy to deduct. The card Dumbledore gave Newt to a safe house in case things went ""terribly wrong"", such as the outbreak of WW2.  At first I thought that the carriage was in the Big Ben, however on a second closer look I realised it is not Big Ben. Where might it be? Also, Queenie is seen near the symbol of a bird. Phoenix? Order of the Phoenix? But that was created to oppose Voldemort according to current information. Another question, what is that yellow, lion like creature with red tail? Could it be a chimaera or if the picture on the wiki is accurate, Nundu? Although the tail doesn't fit as the one seen looks more like a veil or a large piece of cloth rather that what can be seen on the picture.  Towards the end of the trailer, they can be seen standing on the bridge leading to Hogwarts, looking quite serious. Why? In a previous scene you can see what looks like the windows in the Great Hall shatter. Is that why they are there? Could it be connected to the previous trailer where Ministry Officials can be seen entering Hogwarts? Did the Ministry learn that Dumbledore is in a way involved with Gridelwald and they are there to question him? Arrest him? And he was forced to fight back? Could it be after this that they show up? Is that why they look so serious?  Now, a question about the first trailer. Why is Dumbeldore in the DADA classroom? He is a Transfiguration Professor. In this trailer he is seen demonstrating something in front of his students. It also looks like the DADA classroom. Could he be tutoring them extra DADA? Is he creating DA? But why wouldn't the normal DADA Professor do it then? Voldemort have yet to place the curse so they should have a stable DADA Professor so why is it Dumbeldore that is teaching them? Could it be that it is a spell that only he out of the teachers know how to cast? If so, what kind of spell could it be? Patronus? But if so then Dementors must have joined Grindelwald. Or Lethifold as Partonus is also used against them.  There is a scene with with a side of a mountain exploding. The mountains look too big to be anything in Britain so it must be on the continent. Since this movie is set in France, they are either the Pyrenees or the Alps. In the Pyrenees, the only interesting this there is is the Palace of Beauxbatons. I cannot think of a reason why he would attack it so it must mean that those mountains must be the Alps. According to the Harry Potter wiki, the Austrian Alps are home to Golden Eagles, Graphorns, Mountain Trolls and possible Yeti. There isn't much information on Mountain Trolls and I do not know why the side of the mountain would explode as from my own guess, the Trolls do not live inside the mountains as the Trolls are way too big to be an underground species so they most likely they live in valleys between mountains what are difficult to reach. There is a possibility that there is something inside the mountain, but comparing the size and the diameter of the explosion to the trees, whatever was inside must have been at least as tall as the Great Hall of Hogwarts. Around two thirds into the trailer there is another scene with mountains. For a second I thought that it might be where Grindelwald built Nurmengard however the mountains do not fit to the mountains/cliff we have seen in Deathly Hallows. The location seen reminds me of where Elves (Not house elves) would live in LOTR.  I'm just re-watching the trailer again and I think I figured out two things. One would in fact answer one of my previous questions. Dumbeldore is teaching the students the Patronus Charm. He is teaching it so they can defend themselves against the Lethifold. It toke me a while to figure it out. Those veil like objects floating above the building are Lethifolds as another name for them is the Living Shroud that resemble a black cloak roughly half an inch thick. Then looking at what is seen they fit the description very well.  In the scene at Hogwarts where you can see the Quidditch pitch, the way that the players fly is very un-Quidditch like unless you are a seeker. However there are too many of them to be all seekers and I can't exactly see if all the players there are from the same team. If they are then Ok, they are just training. But that still leaves the question of why are those others students running? There are to many of them so they can't be like the Golden Trio always running to the library to help Hermione research.  Also, what is that meeting place? While the scenes showing the place always have Gridelwald in there, it cannot be his and his followers meeting place as Newt and the others shouldn't be there. (If you look at a trend in movies/books battles never take place at a meeting place/headquarters. And no, I do not consider Hogwarts as a meeting place for the OOTP as after Dumbeldore's death they abandoned Grimmauld Place and couldn't use Hogwarts) It is also too small for all of Gridelwald's followers. I thought it might have been the gathering point for ICW but that apparently is located in MACUSA, unless the location is different for every meeting. If that was true, this could also be the place where Grindelwald will declare war. Why is Jacob back? He is a muggle so they should leave him alone. Not drag him back into danger he cannot defend himself from. I understand that he is very funny and most likely romantically involved with Queenie, but they shouldn't have dragged him into this.",8,1,Jhimbo3,8bYBOVWLNIs,0.09359624382351656,2018-09-26 06:38:59,True,True

It was you who kept me up all night,  Yes, my heart was right.     The blossom of your hair,  Kept my breath at heights,  It was you who wandered  In my dreams all night.     Where are you now?  My heart calls you high,  I kept looking;  Losing you was my fright.  But you were always inside me,  You were always my light.  Yes my heart was right.     I am out and out yours,  She said to me in a slapping fight.  All my dreams were quiet,  When I saw you take that flight.     I kept forgetting your footsteps,  They engaged me in a woeful plight,  Maybe what my heart felt was right.     When my pensive past blew me away,  You made me blissful by hugging me tight.     Maybe what my heart felt was right.",0,0,Awais Bhatti,8bYBOVWLNIs,0.2823015873015873,2018-09-26 12:01:55,True,True

Generic any other Depp character with those gestures and way of talking that is almost identical for his some different roles. And he was not in character very much. When i look at Credence i didn't see Ezra Miller or when i see Newt i didn't see Eddy in the movie cause they were in their role as much as its possible but when Depp scene came it was like, yeah this is Depp playing as Grindewald.

2018-09-26T14:06:24,"Damn, after this revelation, i just reread some of Nagini's scenes with Voldemort.  “Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice. “I — I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice nervously. “She set out to explore the house, I think… .”   “You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,” said the second voice. “I will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me greatly.”   “Nagini,” said the cold voice, “you are out of luck. I will not be feeding Wormtail to you, after all … but never mind, never mind … there is still Harry Potter… .”  The snake hissed.   “….Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth … a spell or two of my own invention … a little help from my dear Nagini,” Voldemort’s red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake...  “As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort’s mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything;  he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.”   The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It rose, seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.",268,15,davy jones,8bYBOVWLNIs,0.06951058201058202,2018-09-26 14:06:24,True,True

2018-09-26T18:04:24,Don't know why other people are talking about a side talk by Author J K Rowling. Apparently they have not read Harry Potter books. Here’s why Dumbledore sees Grindelwald in the Mirror of Erised - In the Deathly Hallows it is told that Dumbledore did not went to fight Grindelwald early because he was afraid that Grindelwald will tell the world that Dumbledore's sister was a Obscurial (like Credence in Fantastic beasts) and she died due to a mistake by a spell of Dumbledore when Dumbledore and Grindelwald were having a fight at Dumbledore's home. Dumbledore remained ashamed of himself for this till the end of his life.,0,0,Ankit Khandelwal,8bYBOVWLNIs,-0.04999999999999999,2018-09-26 18:04:24,True,True

Like 3 exes of Johnnies came to his defence and not even Ambers parents came into her defence only like a few friends  3. The change Johnny had in 2015,16 was a lot different between last year and this year and he was still with her in 2015,16 he looks so much better at the end of 2016  4. There was no evidence to prove that he physically hurt her the police even said so and apparently the phone thing they were like very far apart and the phone couldn't of hit her from that far 5. And isn't it weird she went from Johnny to Elon musk  who has lots of money too and just wanted to add we know a lot more about Johnny than we do about Amber please do some more research before believing this crap. And also JK confirmed that Johnny will be in all the sequels...!!!   I'm so outraged that no one is boycotting Aquaman because of her. Double standards I tell you. Johnny's abuse story was never proved in court. It was only Amber's word. His exes came out in his support saying abusing was never in his nature. Whereas Amber has past police record of physical violence on her girlfriend.  Amber is not an angel! Why do you hate Johnny? He's a man - that's the only reason?!

2018-09-26T21:14:32,"It's really disheartening and disappointing to see so many people casting aspersions on Dumbledore's character by suggesting that he always had other people 'do the dirty work' for him. Let's talk about that shall we? To put it simply,Dumbledore's greatest weakness was the lure of power.He had had a painful firsthand experience of it with the death of his sister Arianna,whom,in his heart believed that he was the one who cast the spell that killed her.The trauma of that event coupled with the shame of contemplating anarchy in the Wizarding World with his once best friend and possible lover,drove a wedge of guilt and shame in his heart.So when he tells Newt that he cannot move against Grindelwald, it only serves to underline the fact that Dumbledore still hadn't healed from the scarring and still had remnants of love in his heart for Grindelwald.He was afraid of losing the one person whom he had ever considered to be his equal and had been willing to look past the fallacies of his character.  Newt's empathy for magical creatures and his love for them has deep roots as to the possible reason why Dumbledore wanted him to catch Grindelwald.The first movie had already demonstrated Newt's considerable acuity when dealing with these creatures,but much more so in his dealings with Credence the Obscurus,which must have caught Dumbledore's attention. Since this essentially boils down to a tug of war over power which threatens to overturn the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, at the heart of which could be the Obscurus himself,Dumbledore shies away from it all.This could be because Credence reminds him so much of his dead sister (an Obscurus herself) and his inability to protect her. That's why Dumbledore enlists Newt's help because he knows that the trail to Credence would eventually lead him to Grindelwald.Remember Leta Lestrange's dialogue in the trailer: ""You never met a monster you couldn't love."" Chew on that for a bit. And to the people saying that Dumbledore ""used"" Harry to beat Voldemort,I've really got nothing to add. There are 7 books that provide ample evidence to trounce your claims 7 times over.",0,0,aquib farhan ahmed,8bYBOVWLNIs,0.09231481481481482,2018-09-26 21:14:32,True,True

2018-09-26T23:35:39,"I know I am pretty much alone with this oppinion but I am not a fan of  casting Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. This has nothing to do with Amber Heart, I do not judge actors for their private life (what ever happend in that case) but for their acting (Jude Law for example was a cheater and neverthless I like the way he is acting ). I just don't like the rolles Depp usually plays. I imagined Grindelwald more the charming, youthful but dangerous Loki/Magneto way then the crazy Wonka/Sparrow way. And I fear I will get the last one. So to me the casting is not very fitting.   Still looking forward to the movie tho. Really hoping to see the lovestory between Albus and Gellert. And maybe Depp surprises me. We'll see",2,1,Ria Nielsen,8bYBOVWLNIs,0.015976331360946745,2018-09-26 23:35:39,True,True

2018-09-27T01:55:09,I'm becoming increasingly more ashamed to call myself a Harry Potter fan.  We had an objectively great set of modern classics that have become cheapened since Rowling turned into a moronic SJW embarrassing herself on twitter.  Her new movies have nothing new or interesting to add to the story.  Little easter eggs like Dumbledore being a faggot or Nagini being an animagus are pointless.  She needs to stop milking the old story with these lame ass prequels that nobody asked for and create an entirely new original story set in the wizarding world completely unrelated to Harry Potter.  Imagine if Tolkien or Lewis jumped the shark like this.  I doubt their books would still be so highly regarded decades after their publication.

Indonesia did use the word and the mythological creature back in ancient kingdom (as Rowling stated in her tweet before) BUT it did NOT come from Indonesia, it was from India. I can say this because I'm Indonesian (I do feel a little bit proud Rowling mentioned it) and I do love Claudia Kim (man she's gorgeous af) but I think they should've casted an Indian. And eventhough Rowling insisted Nagini came from Indonesia, Indonesian generally have darker skin colour than Claudia. Too bad Rowling didn't do her research deeply.

Wtf. People are sooo sensitive this days. Can't we just understand that people are gonna be bad and their races and cultural backgrounds do not influence in any way if they will be good or bad? Why minority groups always have to be represented by people good and with good morals?  I think this vitimism is the very thing that makes racism still be such a sensitive topic. Writers have always to make charaters from minority groups good and well seen by the public. As it often happens with gay characters, being always stylist and confident and funny in many shows and movies, and black characters being always cool and funny, and etc. Would there be much complaints if the snake was played by a white woman or man? Does it mean that only Caucasian men and women can be bad or go bad? People change to become bad or they are born bad and the colour of their skin won't define rather they will be bad or good.",0,0,Hades Spawn,8bYBOVWLNIs,0.02821428571428576,2018-09-27 13:57:10,True,True

2018-09-27T14:41:19,"Ugh, it seems that Nagini will become the new “poor misunderstood character” in Harry Potter.  Please, no.   Seriously, Nagini’s future is tragic, i agree; she will one day be forced to turn into a snake forever, presumablylosing her very humanity in its animal mind. But please, Nagini wasn’t a poor innocent girl in Harry Potter. She was a very intelligent snake and she followed Voldemort by her own. She clearly liked him.  Maybe she still had memories about her old life? it’s possible, but it doesn’t change anything.    The Horcrux never affected her (same as Harry). Nagini and Voldemort were close before he made her into an Horcrux. Voldemort made her into an Horcrux after the death of Bertha Jorkins.  Actually, it’s very possible that we’ll see a met between Tom and Nagini in Fantastic Beasts, knowing Rowling.  Maybe people with her affliction lose all aspects of humanity and cognition once the transformation is permanent? Maybe she just become evil because some reason?  We don’t know and we’ll see, but just stop with this nonsense that Nagini was forced by Voldemort to be evil or that she was controlled by him with the Imperius Curse (lol?). She wasn’t.  “Neville killed a poor innocent woman”. Oh boy, NO. Neville didn’t kill an innocent woman. He killed a snake completely loyal to the Dark Lord, who killed and ate many people.  Nagini deserved a redemption arc? seriously? Nagini was not a human being and probably had not been one in decades. She couldn’t be saved and i’m pretty sure that the curse couldn’t be broken (we’ll see in Fantastic Beasts why). Not every character needs or deserves a redemption arc .-.

Heck, even Harry died, though he came back.  However, here Newt is gonna die and there is no coming back for the poor lad.   1.He knew that the ring carried a curse, yet he still put it on. He could have destroyed it and freed the stone from the ring and then used it just like Harry did. But no, the old fool had to put it on before. I guess it was a form of suicide. Maybe he was too scared to hunt the Horcruxes and face the war because that's what it comes out to be  2. Just because he loves Grindelwald, he isn't gonna hunt him down. What a loser Does he not realise that a war is going on?  And in war, people have to make heart wrenching decisions.   Even going so far as to fight people who are family, who they love..   All for fighting for what is right. Countless wizards and witches, not to mention brave people elsewhere have stood up to the people they love but I guess, that's for the common folks to abide by the ideals.

I really think she deeply cared and maybe loved Credence. And for some reason maybe Credence is the reason that pulled Nagini away from the good side. I dunno maybe Credence died because of Nagini (maybe accidentally or maybe purposely killed Credence) and that devastated her the most and became so evil and found comfort and felt loved once again by the dark lord or maybe  Credence sacrificed his life for Nagini which lead Nagini devastated and yeah made her the Nagini that we truly hated.   I mean I really hate Nagini she killed the man that I idolized from the very first series of Harry Potter, Professor Snape and yeah it devatated me a lot. But still every bad guys went through a lot of pain that lead them to become what they really are now right?

You only wanna believe she was. But if you actually read, listen or pay any attention to them when they speak to each other. You will know that Voldemort and Nagini were closer than you think. Voldemort for one put apart of his soul inside her. That is extremely risky to do. And by how they talk to each other. It seems that she would've accepted his offer. Especially since Voldemort calls her HIS FRIEND. If you wanna know who the true slave to Voldemort is. Look at Peter Pettigrew. He's the slave. Voldemort never spoke kindly to really anyone.

Also this begs the question if Nagini actually loved Voldemort as well? If she was just a regular snake,I'm sure she would have just hung around because Voldemort fed her.

People saying it was a horrible casting decision, like have they even watched Depp's movies? The man can act and can definitely act in magical/fantasy movies. Watch plenty of Tim Burton's films and they'll prove that. People think bc of the the last couple POTC movies that he's lost his touch. While those last two films might be horrible, he worked with what he had and still nailed the role. Plus he looks like he's in his element playing Grindelwald. In the beginning when he casts Serpentlsortia at the carriage driver, then floods the carriage with watter and then opens the door and flicks the man out; he's doing it so languidly and yet still showing off what a badass he is, plus his small speech alone of his dream where wizards stand free in the world is amazing. I might get bashed even more for this but people were irritated when Heath Ledger was first cast as the Joker and then people saw him and were blown away; have a little faith. The movie hasn't even come out yet. He'll do a great job. Take 0:55 for instance, just that short clip of him surrounded by blue Fiendfyre and almost conducting the flames before him like an or chestra, and then out of nowhere shadowing his wand aggressively; show how Grindelwald will take his time appreciating the magic before letting loose with power.

2018-09-30T19:18:24,"A lot of people here are commenting what's wrong with Nagini being an Asian woman. Lol your white ignorance is showing here. First of all, Nagini is from the Sanskrit word Naagin meaning snake therefore something exclusively Indian, this later spread to Southeast Asia. The actress is a Korean actress aka not either Indian or Southeast Asian origin. This shows how to JKR, all Asians are the same and interchangeable. If y'all can clamor about British characters not being played by British actors because the non-Brit actors mess up the accents, imagine our horror when we see a Korean woman portraying a character that should be at best Indian. Secondly, Nagini is treated like a pet by Voldemort, a white British man whose mind is full of Nazism-esque idealism. A white guy with a woman of color/Asian as his pet!! This is such a colonist view about Asians by the British folks who colonized Asia for so long. This plotline is shown in a very problematic and disgusting way by JKR. Thirdly, a woman as a man's pet is also a very sexist and misogynist portrayal. As a woman, JKR should've known better. Before y'all white people come yelling at people of color when we criticize a racist thing, sit calmly and listen to us. We've been and still are victims of racism.

Nope, Voldemort had to have forced her to follow him, despite the books constantly providing proof of how charming he is and how Nagini could have found a kindred spirit in him, especially once she had transformed fully and there was literally no one else aside from Harry she could even communicate with.",65,5,Kol,8bYBOVWLNIs,0.26666666666666666,2018-09-30 21:09:51,True,True

2018-10-04T16:58:56,"Story time. I feel like a seer. Okay, I was really obsessed with Harry Potter about a year ago, and I wanted to write fanfiction. So I developed this really complex plot with Voldemort having a younger sister (I think I made it so that Merope didn't die, but survived and wanted revenge on Tom Riddle Sr. so she seduced him or something and they had another child like 10 years later?), and that younger sister was an animagus. I'd read somewhere that Voldy met Nagini in a forest, so that younger sister (I believe I named her Cassiopeia--called herself Opeia) met Voldy in her animagus form and tricked him into thinking she was an actual snake. So when he made her into a horcrux, she used that fact as leverage to manipulate _Voldemort himself_ into finding a way to resurrect her dead husband (I don't know, my brain is weird, I was a precocious child). Opeia wasn't even the protagonist, she was the antagonist, I had it all planned out and stuff.   AND NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT NAGINI IS AN ACTUAL LADY???  I'M A DAMN SEER.

I think all of us need to agree, that for us to judge the characters, the story and everything we should watch the movie first. Right now we just see the scenes that are going to be there and some really cool and interesting lines, so  no one can really judge anything right now except for the scenes and everything we see and hear at the moment. Of course it is understandable that there are some scenes and characters that people don't like and THAT'S okay! But the point still stands, this isn't the full movie yet.

As a matter of fact, he always knew what creating those would cost him, and that death is inevitable, which makes him at the very least, far more wise than Voldemort.  I personally think that Grindelwald was more powerful than Voldemort in terms of knowledge/spell skills, but Voldemort was far more cruel, destructive, and at his end almost irrational (also very skilled), which combined, made him even more dangerous than Grindelwald itself.

Considering that Nagini is so incredibly close to Voldermort in an emotional sense as a part of Voldemort himself and physically committed to be with him wherever he goes, you can't help but wonder. Was the commitment Voldemort had to Nagini as a snake and the woman behind Nagini in human form a bond that could be within the realm of a love only understood by Voldemort himself. I say this because dedication and commitment to protect something that is as deep in yourself as your soul...isn't that a strong emotion based in that realm.  On the other side; did Nagini's curse become a much deeper and tragic curse because Voldemort saw her as an opportunity to have a horcrux he could physically control to try to feel absolutely safe knowing he has cursed Nagini to be a servant such as Wormtail and the immortal curse of committment in carrying an important peice of the person who is literally your master?

For those of you who have not seen the first movie, I highly recommend watching it. You don't need to, but it deepens the experience and there are some basic things you'll carry into this movie. I Highly recommend it, but watching the first Fantastic Beasts movie is not needed. Next, this is one of a handful of movies that watching in 3D truly enhances. Most 3D movies left me feeling like I could have watched it without the 3D option and find myself just as entertained.  For me, 3D for this movie was amazing and worth the price.

Besides good performances from Depp, Law, Miller, and Redmayne, an amazing opening aerial chase scene, a few new fantastic beasts, and the little bit of Hogwarts we see, it was really boring and tiring.

2018-11-18T06:21:12,"I think this movie would have been better if they hadn't had so many subplots in it, and focused more on Newt, his beasts, and his friends (Jacob, Queenie, and Tina (well love interest with her)). I mean I fell in love with the first film because of those four characters, especially Newt. I absolutely love them. And I was hoping I would see them grow further in this movie, but they dulled their stories down. I was so disappointed. I still love them in this. But I wanted to see Newt shine further. Witness his massive kindness and big heart more, see Jacob continue to marvel at the wizarding world with such wonder in his eyes, see Queenie's big smile and bubbly innocence, and Tina's understanding and caring personality. There was some of that here, but not nearly as much as in the first film. Those were some of the many reason's I fell in love with them in the first place. But they barely grew here. The biggest thing that happened was with Queenie, not going to spoil it for those that haven't seen this yet. But we barely get to see them grow at all here. My favorite part of the movie was probably the simplest, with Newt and that lion creature, the Zouwu. It was just a big kitty cat in the end. It was adorable. I loved seeing Newt interact with him, and of course the Niffler. That made me smile big time. Newt and his friends were again, the best part of the movie. The others I couldn't seem to care as much about. I liked Leta's parts alright, she wasn't too bad. I felt of Creedence and Nagini, but I really couldn't get into their story that much. I actually didn't care that much for the ministry stuff, or Grindelwald's storyline (well he's the villain, but sometimes I can actually get into the villain's story as well, but I can't with him- he just doesn't make me give a shit at all), and surprisingly neither does Dumbledore's story. I mean I like his backstory with Grindelwald, but it's hardly shown here. For some reason I can't care about Dumbledore here. I like Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films, but the younger version of him just doesn't get me into his story. I love Jude Law, but for some reason it doesn't take here. Anyway, to sum this all up, the story would have been a lot better if some of the subplots had been cut, and more focus would have been on Newt and his circle. Just saying. I mean it's still called Fantastic Beasts isn't it. Newt and his beasts should still be the focus and how they tie into what is going on in the world around them, not the other way around.",9,0,Candace Garrett,8bYBOVWLNIs,0.1863514957264957,2018-11-18 06:21:12,False,True

Worst of all, there's far too much gratuitous use of established characters acting completely out of character, with absolutely no reason to support it.   The story might as well have been written by fanboys of the first fantastic beasts film, who had no knowledge of the seven book series from whence the idea was spawned... and who wrote the screenplay whilst imbibing on copious amounts of whiskey and PCP.  If the rest of the films are like this, the last one might as well end with Harry Potter sitting bolt-upright in his bed, bathed in a cold sweat, realising that it was all just a bad dream.   This was the biggest letdown, since Barack Obama was elected as President.  Edit: I don't consider Cursed Child as part of the canon. It retcon far too much; and is abhorrent.",0,1,Mick Psyphon,8bYBOVWLNIs,-0.09166666666666666,2018-12-01 05:17:36,False,True

The human race seriously needs to move on from Harry Potter and all related media. It's been bled absolutely dry, people! First by the alarmingly repulsive fanbase (of whom I officially stopped counting myself after The Deathly Hallows came and went) and now by the very people who made these movies a big thing in the first place. Whatever mystique and wonder this franchise ever had was killed off as early as The Goblet Of Fire, when the series unceremoniously turned into an emo teen drama that, in retrospect, was like a bad version of Persona 5, and now they're determined to run the 'Wizarding World' concept (because it's apparently a concept now) completely into the ground, with wands becoming little more than steampunk lightsabers for the sake of marketability and the characters being blander and more one-dimensional than... I can't even think of anything, they're THAT bad! I mean, yeah, Jacob Kowalski brings the laughs, but our lead man Newt? BLAND. He's not funny, he's not charming and I REALLY hope that none of you find him relatable, because if you do, that's just sad. He's not a character; he's a one-dimensional rubber pole for the other characters to bounce off of. And Tina? PLEASE. The 'romance' between her and Newt is about as believable as Anakin and Padmé in Attack Of The Clones. As for Queenie... Well, suffice to say that her potential flew out the window first chance it got. Grindelwald is the only interesting character, and he comes across as a watered down Voldemort, complete with a tendency to stalk children. Speaking of which, don't even get me STARTED on how I couldn't give two fucks about Credence. He's related to Dumbledore, you say? Well, you can take THAT blatant middle finger to the audience and stick it up your bum, Warner Bros! I usually sympathise with the younger characters, but I look at Credence and all I see and hear is emo, emo, EMO! Why must you continue to beat this franchise into the ground, Warner Bros? Oh, that's right, because MONEY. If you had any respect for JK Rowling's work, you'd leave well-enough alone and let the Harry Potter franchise remain in the past as an at least somewhat respectable part of film history, but noooooo, you have to squeeze every possible penny out of it, don't you? Every last drop of vitality until it's a faded husk on the floor! You're the EA of movie studios, and I'm done with you.

In my opinion, crimes of Grindelwald was confusing at first, but more you look into it, more things you can find fascinating. I think this movie was a masterpiece. Not the best one, but it also wasn't horibble.",0,2,FireBudgie,8bYBOVWLNIs,0.43571428571428567,2020-05-20 14:20:52,False,False

2020-05-22T22:30:38,"OKAY, WAIT... cuz I just finished reading the Harry Potter series and now I have questions.  In the books, Dumbledore defeated Grindewald. That was the entire basis of the end of the story. Dumbledore defeated Grindewald which made him the master of the elder wand (or whatever tf it was called). That means when Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore in book 6, Malfoy because the master of the wand. So when Harry disarmed Malfoy in book 7, Harry became the master of the Wand.  Voldemort killed Snape because he mistakenly thought Snape was the master of the wand since Snape had killed Dumbledore. he didn't realize that Draco had already disarmed Dumbledore prior to Snape killing him.  This was the entire point of the ending!! Because Harry was the master of the wand, Voldemort couldn't use it to kill him. That's why his spell backfired onto himself.  So how tf are they gone say he asked Newt to kill Grindewald in this movie??  AAAAAND... I'm confused because Harry came to the conclusion that Dumbledore had seen his sister and brother in that mirror BUT I am willing to overlook this because Harry thought this after Dumbledore explained the story to him - Dumbledore never confirmed this. He may very well had seen Grindewald in the mirror.  BUUUUUUUT the whole Newt going after Grindewald thing literally does not make sense at all.",0,0,FlowerTower,8bYBOVWLNIs,0.013636363636363634,2020-05-22 22:30:38,False,False
