The man is stabbed and knocked out multiple times, with no consequences; the woman had chances to steal the gun, but apparently wanted to drag out the suspense by running instead. He keeps acting like he's a part of the family, not being careful of objects smashing against his head after revealing his bad deeds.

2018-06-30T15:26:50,"On the Revisionist History podcast, Malcolm Gladwell uses this film to illustrate how the best action to take, like running out of the house and leaving the kid with the killer, are often socially-taboo (30m mark).     Like pulling the hockey goalie in order to add another offensive player, if you're down by 2 or more, 12min before the game ends [SSRN/biorxiv]!    Another great movie is Force Majeure where very early in the movie, a husband runs away from what looks like an oncoming avalanche, leaving the wife and kids behind.   The avalanche never happens, but the rest of the movie, is about the social aftermath of his decision.        The movie Funny Games, is also interesting in that at no point was there anything that the victims could have done and still acted politely or socially acceptable, until it was too late.
