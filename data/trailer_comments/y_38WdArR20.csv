We are talking about completely different mentality of today's, mentality that is today revised, sugar coated and considered backwards and conservative.

Owsley again warned the Southern people that the North was attempting to imprint its views upon the minds of Southern youth. He warned that the North was attempting to teach Southern young people that their history was a history of error. He warned of textbooks designed to give Southerners a proper education in Northern traditions and at the same time label the Southern cause as evil or unrighteous. As Owsley pointed out, the North made every attempt to destroy the South with naked military force. After the war came the second attack.

So black people can't do shit without the white man's help?"" but no this time it's white people that are offended by a film that casts the vast majority of them in a good light.   Look everyone, I get it, Black Lives Matter and the SJWs and just about everyone that is in the media today is basically saying, ""Just believe what anyone who isn't white is saying because white people should feel guilty"" but this film isn't saying that, it's saying that everyone in America are equals and that the white farmers and the black slaves shouldn't have their lives used as a resource to keep the rich rich.
