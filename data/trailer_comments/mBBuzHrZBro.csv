Although Tom Hanks is excellent I think the standout performance is from Mark Rylance who plays the Russian spy , Rudolf Abel . His understated dour acting is brilliant to watch.

2017-12-27T19:58:44,"I just saw this Spielberg directed flick and it is really well done.  Hanks is great and the story, based on the downing of Frances Gary Powers' U2 spy plane over the Soviet Union in '57 is very accurately done with flawless CGI.  One honest man, the lawyer played by Hanks, is recruited by the CIA to travel to West Berlin and negotiate for the exchange of Powers for a Soviet spy recently captured in the US and named Rudolph Abel.  There is an unexpected wrinkle in the plan when a young American economics graduate student , visiting his girlfriend, gets caught and promptly arrested on the East Berlin side of the wall that the Soviets are erecting at the time to keep the Germans from fleeing over to West Berlin.  The CIA is only interested in getting Powers back before he can tell the Soviets any secret information, but Hanks' character decides that there will be no deal unless he can exchange Abel for both men.  There is a lot of taut negotiating involved and this film will give the viewer a realistic view of the kind of mutual Cold War paranoia that existed at that time as well as the bleak nature of life in West Berlin whose bombed and shot out buildings the Soviets decided would not be rebuilt so they could be a constant reminder to the Germans living there that they had lost WWII.  Anyway, a really interesting flick which should appeal to those interested in the history of the Cold War.",0,0,Ken Behrendt,mBBuzHrZBro,0.11841269841269841,2017-12-27 19:58:44,False,False
