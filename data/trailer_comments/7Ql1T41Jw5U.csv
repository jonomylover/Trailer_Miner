Also, I somewhere read they were going to add a love triangle? Why would they even do that, its obvious that romance and the conflict of choosing between two guys is not the plot of the story, and Tris has no time nor energy to decide between Four and whoever is the other guy. If they actually add a love triangle I would be so so mad. Also, the graphics are great. I would love if they would go to The Hunger Games path and not change much about the book because this serie is actually great and they'll kind of ruin it throwing random things to change the plot, but at the end is an adaptation. Alsoo, I kind of feel they are gonna let live that ONE person that dies on Allegiant, because of all the negative reviews about it and that would be like the worst thing ever.

2014-11-13T04:59:01,"Just to clear a few things up (No spoilers):  First off, the CGI. The CG is so bad in the trailer for one of two reasons. The first is that this is one of Tris' nightmares and they are trying to display that this is a dream by making the CG look fake. The second reason (unlikely) is that this whole scene you are seeing here, is purely made for advertising. Many movies have done this before, and it's kind-of smart because it shows what kind of action you'll be seeing in the movie, without actually seeing scenes from the movie.  Secondly, Tris' haircut. We're all freaking out for one of two reasons. The first is all the people who haven't read the book and think that they just did this because it was convenient. Tris did cut her hair at the begging of the story. The second is people are wondering why it's so short. I think that it's this short because it would be so stupid if Shailene walked around with a wig, when in reality, it would be pointless to wear a wig because the effort does not profit.  Lastly, people are wonder why Abnegation is blown up or this didn't happen in the story. Abnegation being wrecked is probably like metaphor for all her people being destroyed or this is just how Tris imagines it in her head. Again, this might just be for advertising reasons, but it doesn't really matter if Tris' nightmares are changed, I mean, come on guys.  Thanks for reading!

First of all, in the books Tris cuts her hair so regardless of whether her hair is short on the actress, that's what Veronica Roth (the author) had her do in the second book anyway so it's necessary. Her mother is already dead so this is a dream which means that the graphics/slow motion/dramatics were put there purposefully to indicate that it isn't real. Because this is a teaser trailer, even though this particular scene wasn't in the books, Tris does have insistent dreams of her mother in the books so obviously they're playing on not showing what's going to happen in the movie because Insurgent really lurches right in and if they show too much in the trailer it'll be a massive spoiler and they're also amplifying her pain from losing her mother whilst showing the newer and stronger version of herself she's become.

Seriously.  **WARNING: THERE IS SOME MAJOR MAJOR SPOILER SHIZ DOWN BELOW AND IT WILL RUING THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE IF YOU EVER EVER PLAN ON READING ANY OF THE BOOKS (especially at book three of Divergent)**  Dystopian books are IN. They're POPULAR! There's a ton of them everywhere you go so just because one came out first and they're both popular doesn't mean one is a knockoff.¬† ""They both have female leads."" Yes. It's also been happening a lot lately. Giving woman recognition and showing they can be strong too? Yeah that happens. What about the Legend series? If that gets huge will it be a copy too? ""They both have hot boyfriends."" Really? Katniss actually struggles with two boys and she doesn't know which she loves for a majority of the series. Tris gets the guy easily but they struggle at being a couple. ""They're both special."" Okay 1, they're the MAIN CHARACTER so they usually have an advantage. 2, Katniss is ""special"" because she rebelled with some berries (I love THG btw I'm not trashing it). Tris has a different mindset than most people which makes her a danger to the government which is trying to rule and control simpleminded people. ""They both fight the government."" Yeah well that can actually be a representation of the actual fights countries have with their government and people and how some feel that the government rules over us. OR it could be a situation that represents fighting against those who hold you back from who you want and need to be. ""They are both split into groups."" This is actually very common in any work of art. Book, movie, play, song, FANFICTION, etc. There is always a separation be it cliques in a high school or making twenty foot walls to divide a country. ""They're both written by woman."" Leave. ""They both have the same plot."" The Hunger Games book one is about Katniss surviving the games, well mainly. Book two is about Katniss surviving the games a second time along with Peeta again because the government is trying to kill her off. Book three is about how she was rescued by fugitives and now they need to overthrow their corrupt government, or at least President Snow, to save many lives and fix Panem (North America). Divergent book one is Tris trying to make it through the tough initiation of her new faction and also hiding her specialness from the Erudite. And then saving her home faction. Book two is her trying to still hide her secret from the government and soon finding out how messed up it really is with the killing of the Divergents and blah blah blah fix things (again I love this series too no hate haha). Book three is about them finding out that their city is just an experiment among many others and that it is destined to destroy itself so they should probably fix it and save everyone's lives and Tobias isn't actually divergent and they need to save a a lot more than just their city because these experiment people are also pretty bad by letting people die and all of this stuff linking Tris's mom to the start of the Chicago experiment and yeah someone important dies shhhhhh. And then The Maze Runner series- nah I'm just kidding, but those books are amazing!!

That's extremely unfair. Divergent retained the general essence and conception of the story we read and loved, and Insurgent will hopefully stand strong in the semantics of where divergent subjectively might have failed. But what we need to realise is,  The visual experience is very different from reading a story off paper. There's a different flow to it, a different dynamic. It is necessary to have adjustments, especially as long as it does n't mangle the integrity of its world. As Divergent fans, we will have remarks, but lets refrain from utterly unnecessary critical remarks. We should encourage this franchise. It is the fans who can often unintentionally bring about the downfall of film adaptions-granted some of them are dreadful, but they don't warrant quite as much disdain as they often get. Insurgent looks good, and I have hopes that it will be amazing, from this very bare minimal smidge of the film we've seen.
