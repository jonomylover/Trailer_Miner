I love Mike too. I got a picture of Bruce and Mike from Death Wish on my Facebook page. It's funny to see Mike playing a doctor because he don't do serious characters that often LOL. I love Elisabeth Shue, Dean Norris, Wendy Crewson and Vincent D'Onoforio who are in Death Wish. Bruce and Vincent did another movie called Fire With Fire. Fire With Fire is good. I'm gonna see Death Wish next weekend. Death Wish is a remake of Charles Bronson's 1970's movie. Charles did 5 Death Wish sequels. I liked all 5 Death Wish sequels. RIP Charles and I miss you. I agree Someguy827. Action movies aren't coming to the theaters that much anymore. Most action movies are straight to video. Bruce Willis, Cole Hauser and Mike Epps have a new movie that's coming straight to video this month. The movie is called Acts Of Violence. I saw Death Wish last weekend on a bootleg dvd I got from the video store. The movie hasn't came out on video yet. I guess it'll be on video next month. Bruce and Elisabeth Shue's daughter is hot.
