Plus, the one ""trope"" that I hate in female lead movies is that all of them have that one scene where the insanely dumb, chauvinist bad guy makes some dumb comment undermining the female character, the female character then responds with a witty retort and then proceeds to beat the male character either physically or in whatever way they're competing.

""Karsten Braasch v the Williams Sisters During the 1998 Australian Open, sisters Serena and Venus Williams boasted that they could beat any man ranked outside the world's top 200. The challenge was accepted by Karsten Braasch, a German player ranked No 203 (his highest ranking was No 38). Before the matches, Braasch played a round of golf in the morning, drank a couple of beers, smoked a few cigarettes, and then played the Williams sisters for a set each, one after the other. He defeated Serena, 6-1, and Venus, 6-2. Serena said afterwards ""I didn't know it would be that hard. I hit shots that would have been winners on the women's tour and he got to them easily.""  In 1999 when Serena Williams was 18 and ranked 4th in the world, she re-opened the debate on whether women can compete with men in professional sport. The US Open champion believed she could take on and beat the best players in the men's game - she even applied for a wild card entry to take part in a men's singles event, the Eurocard Open, but this did not eventuate, mainly because she could not compete as she was not a man.""",0,1,Valek77777,WMdzBwsZRX8,0.06372549019607843,2017-05-19 09:51:51,True,True

I don't think most men are offended by this, I think they are tired of the feminist agenda being shoved down their throats, as am I and i'm a woman. Nobody here is denying that women succeeding as a good thing, it's just that there is a distinct ideology that many people don't buy into that is being seen in more and more and films. A good example of this for the left wing viewers is movies solely based on religion and how amazing it is, I also don't care for such movies because their agenda is so strong that the storyline is pretty shit.

Yeah, that old guy who at 60s tried to play again a woman in her prime and nearly defeated her was true. So what? Woman in top shape won against an old guy? What to get offended about? Is it about that guy is portrayed as happy-going sexist? Big deal, every feminist movie is portraying men as such or worse. Not a single man get offended about this as there were much worse films, not even mentioning that this film looks like it will take a jab at feminists as well (at least it appear to do so from trailer). Only one who are getting offended here are women. And not because someone said something, but because they assume that men WILL get offended.  Comments: 1) ""There's no reason at all for anyone to be triggered by this. I mean it actually happened. Bitching and moaning about it won't do shit for you. :/"" 2) ""The fragility of the men in this comments section is hilarious and yet slightly worrying, this story isn't uplifted from some 3rd wave feminist tumblr blog IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED!

Women succeeding doesn't take anything away from men so grow a pair and get over it."" 6) ""Men are pissed off because a REAL LIFE story is being made into a film? I'm laughing my ass off, the fragility of their ego is too much. We get it not all men are misogynists, this just happens to portray one who was, get over it."" 7) ""Smart people: ""Hmm a true story about equality?

Was rather a joke that didn't tell the real story and the sad thing is it's supposed to make you think that it's telling the real story behind the scenes but it was pretty much SJW crap.  King has even admitted she struggled to beat Riggs who was 25 years older than her.  This admission doesn't mean men are inherently better than women and Riggs didn't even act like it did after the match and also admitted to struggling.  The impression I got from newstories and interviews in all the years since then, they remained who they were but the competition gave them respect for each other.  This, the truth, would have made a better story.  I was just a teen and have never been into sports when this match took place but I remember it and I gave it a chance despite some of its stars' (Silverman, you loon, I'm looking at you) reps for being PC police because done right, it would have been good but instead of being done right, it was SJW twiddle and not fairly balanced.  Don't get me wrong.  It would have been equally bad if it was one-sided the other way also and made King look like a clown instead of Riggs.  This was a real opportunity to promote equality while also showing that assumptions on both sides were wrong and arguments on both sides that had points -- instead it was biased dribble.  And was Margaret Court really that horrid?  For a movie with a bias towards the empowerment of women, it was really extremely catty towards her.  Very, very disappointing.  What a pity.

(yes! this kind of comments are done mostly by males, but this is not ""hateful"" comments itself or even ""triggered"" comments, they are just either giving an opinion or stating a factual point, of course, a female can beat a male in something the same way a male can beat a female in something, there are a lot of things that can affect the result of a match in different sports) 3) people talking about how good the movie seems to be and how they love Emma Stone. (not a big fan of her, but kind of understand the love for her) 4) people talking about Steve Carell looking like Mike Myers aka Austin Powers. (he kind of does in the movie, at least in a certain way) 5) people actually talking about the movie being trash or something like that just because it shows a female lesbian who happens to be a figure of tennis for women and how it sucks that he won over a male. (just a bunch of comments, almost non-existent considering that there are more than 1,600 comments) 6) other kinds of comments.

I'm sure it had to feel like a personal victory for Billie Jean King for a minute, as there were probably doubts leading up to the match. After all, Bobby Riggs had beaten Margaret Court earlier that year in the same kind of publicity thing. But how did it become more than just a moral victory for Billie Jean King? Because people made it that? He was 55, and she was 30. This was 1973. He was at the top of his game 36 years earlier. She wasn't playing Ilie Nastase or John Newcombe. Would it be that big of a deal if Serena Williams were to beat Bjorn Borg in a match today?
