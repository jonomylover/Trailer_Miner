2018-02-08T09:58:40,"I have often said that Denzel Washington doesn't make a bad movie. While it's not strictly true ( Re-The Taking of Pelham 123) he makes an average film extremely watchable and that is exactly the case with the unfortunately named film Roman J. Israel, Esq.   Roman has spent most of his career as a silent partner in a law firm that specialises in criminal cases and pro-bono work, helping out those worst off in Los Angeles.  When something happens to Jackson, Israel is forced to handle the cases. The loss of his partner leads to many changes around the firm and Israel finds himself in a world completely foreign to him. He then does something totally wrong which makes him have to make some serious decisions.  This is a directorial debut by Dan Gilroy and you can kind of see it's his first film. The story is all over the place at times and there is far too much that Gilroy has tried to squeeze in and the film suffers for that. This is fundamentally a character study film and Denzel does a great job ' although even when he's trying to be a character with social engagement problems he still manages to look cool!  The Colin Farrell character was a strange one too. I'm still not sure if he was meant to be horrible and mean or that he was meant to be a mentor to Isreal ?  I did like this film but it could have been improved with half an hour shaved off and maybe a director who had more story telling experience.

2018-03-04T11:11:43,"Folks, Denzel Washington is a rubicon crossed and has been setting the bar for A-listers silently aware of his grade. Given the dull soundtrack from the Academy on Roman, it must be uncomfortable for the cream of his genre to observe an artist completely disappearing into his character, with ease. Fences was a warm-up but at the least, Viola was mentioned. Here it is simply Roman playing Roman and to borrow the phrase from Man on Fire, Washington is painting his Masterpiece. But Gilroy, the writer/director, should have scripted George and Roman with an edge to make them a tad more real and less philosophical. Even an amateurish attempt such as this may have spiced things up:- ¬† ¬† ¬†  George Pierce: - Welcome aboard! I hear you had a run-in with Jessie Salinas, my number two. You called him a tourist - to his face? I know you are set in your ways and despite being in some sort of time warp, I take it you do not suffer fools, but be patient and hold your knives on Salinas for the interest of the firm. By the way, his days are numbered.¬†  Roman J. Israel: - I apologise for dissing Salinas but I am thrilled he is on the way out. I understand partners form a sort of Coalition of the Willing - if I may borrow the phrase from Bush - serving the interest of its clientele, while filling gaps in social justice, civil rights and pro-bono work when needed, in the spirit of making the world a better place. ¬†  Pierce: - You are really in a time warp aren't you! Filling gaps in social justice, civil rights and pro-bono work are excellent marketing strategies but taking this route will bankrupt my show; and I'll be driving a Proton, eating burgers and taking the subway. Besides, making the world a better place is a strange concept, and I prefer the phrase Coalition of the Billing, instead. I know it is less noble but honest, don't you agree? The tagline has been our guiding motto at the business end of my golf driver. Simply put, those who work diligently in my financial interest are amply rewarded with a defined track into my inner circle that comes with a stake in my fiefdom, which in turn earns my protection from hordes lurking at the borders.¬†  Roman: - You got me nervous there for a while and I am relieved to hear I am in your inner circle. In the old firm, I always regarded myself as the Underboss to the Don, as opposed to a mere Consigliore and definitely not a Capo or Soldier. Those lesser designations are for posers like Salinas and the other noisy bits on the periphery.¬†  Pierce: - I am not fond of the Mafia, neither do I use its crude terminology. I insist on the standard law partnership jargon where the vocabulary is 'civilized' thus ensuring a soundtrack that is clean, distinct and goes well at the cocktails. Let's just say, for too long I promoted a 'wrong lawyer' as my right-hand man, simply on the basis of glib and swagger; and I am weighing my options in the interest of the firm once Salinas 'steps down' while mindful that the one willing to sacrifice and bring his 'retirement' to its logical conclusion shall earn my trust and enjoy generous lockstep increases in compensation. You get my drift, Roman?  Roman: - George, you're clear as a bell! Simply put, Jessie Salinas is the 'wrong lawyer' you promoted and you want him plugged to make me your right-hand man. In polite language, subject to the availability of the appropriate implement from the 'brothers', Salinas may be in need of some quiet therapy, of a ballistic nature. You get my drift, George?  George:- Dang!
