The polish couple saved over 300 jewish people and when the fight started in the country the jews lived and grew up they didn't join the locals in the fight but were hiding in the cellar!  Anyway most movies about WW2 are about jews suffering. But there were also many other people who suffered and died. But nobody ever makes a movie about them.   In the concentration camps for example a lot of people think that only jews were killed there which is simply not true! There were millions of other people also killed such as: Russians, Poles, Ukrainians, Roma, Serbs, Slovens and many more. But in the public opinion when talking about Auschwitz and concentration camps people are simply not aware of that.   I hope there will be a movie about Witold Pilecki. The fact that there are so many movies about WW2 but none features him is weird.
