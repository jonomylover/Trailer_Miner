Kersey is a broken man, who does terrible things because the world is even more broken; something that a lot of people at that time could identify with and only got worse as the decade went along (Bernie Goetz). Given the fact the after decades of violent crime having a general downward trend only to start skyrocketing again last year, and the fact that the 2016 Chicago homicides is highest in 19 years and that the city has had over 400 homicides this year already I feel like a Death Wish movie could totally work in a modern Chicago.

Look what happened in CA and at other protests around this country, they all happened to be working for the left at the time and tons of innocent people were hurt, robbed and rapped and almost all the offenders walk the streets today.   But hey, that's the American way, you make your way on your own, you fall on your own,  unless you're a lazy fuck at the SSI and welfare office crying because no one gave you a shot or told you how to make it. Those are the people that the powers that be keep that info from and are left to uphold laws written by people that can not, will not and are not held to.   Yeah, you are free in this country, these days, you are free to what you're told unless you're smart enuff to make your own way. the left wants your guns for that reason.   This is a great movie up to the point they start preaching at you that this is not the way to solve your problems and that the justice system is the only way to solve your problems. Ask the boys that didn't come home from Benghazi if they got justice, how about all the evil dick heads that stole homes from thousands here in the states back in 07-08 and still going. It only took like 10 years to capture and kill the man they said killed nearly 4000 people on 9/11.  How about the war on drugs, anybody feel the justice system has worked for anybody since Nixon declared the drugs the CIA has been pumping in this country are the enemy of the people.   Fuck that,  you want something in this country you have to work for it and if you want to protect that, well, you're not going to get the people you pay to protect you to do anything but patronize you through the whole process after you've been wronged.  Life is as good as YOU make it and only YOU can keep that safe. Your pursuit of happiness is only guaranteed if you can get up off your ass and TAKE it and MAKE it for yourself. If you can do that without hurting or violating the man or woman next to you then there is the American dream but as soon as anyone thinks what I have should be there's and they try to take it, I'm not waiting on politicians and under paid,  over trained police to solve my problems.  When we the people can come together and see that we are being lied to,  with extream prejudice,  by the super rich in this world maybe then we can talk about programs to help one another, but until there is a unification and single mindedness of people that actually care about justice and want the best for all people than it will always be every man or woman for themselves. I doubt it will happen in my lifetime and the way the millennial generation is pointed it doesn't look like things will likely change anytime soon.

The sad part is, one of the tweets that sparked this came from a FILM critic. I honestly don't think he's ever seen an action movie. Since when is the whole revenge/vengeance/vigilante justice trope an alt-right thing? Those plot devices are extremely old, very common and overused out the ass. A guy getting wronged only to seek revenge by killing everyone who stands in his path to kill the guy(s) directly responsible. We've seen this 1000 times over. It's basically the gold standard for action movies. It's also the plot for Django Unchained, you know a black slave getting released only to kill every last white dude for kidnapping his wife. Oh and John Wick. They killed his fucking dog! In the case of this remake his wife is murdered and daughter is raped and beaten. He gets angry because the cops don't do anything and he's living in a city where crime is out of control.

The trailer isn't awful, and contrary to what some critics have said, I don't see how it's ""alt-right,"" but I am getting the feeling here that the filmmakers do not understand the original. I'm not saying that there's no room for creative license, it's just one of those things where I ask ""what's the point of remaking a classic?""  For one thing, I really hate the choice of music in this trailer. Don't get me wrong, Back in Black is a great song, but its use is such a cliche at this point and it's not fitting at all, especially if you've seen the original film. On top of that, in the original, Kersey was a more reluctant vigilante. In fact, he didn't even really become a vigilante at first, he just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (multiple times, actually) and he defended himself, rather than seeking out criminals. Like I said, I hope the full movie will be better.

While it could be viewed that way, it only shows what it's like nowadays, which is rather conservative. Having someone buy a gun in a movie doesn't make it conservative.  2: I have not seen ONE liberal in this comment section, and yet I've seen so many conservatives insulting and saying ""take that liberals! I bet you're all so upset!"" No. We're not. I'm not.

Nothing new here, not even SJWs poisoning everything under the sun is new. However, liberals never stop surprising me with the stupid shit they say and complain about.   Batman. John Wick. Django Unchained.  Weird how those movies with the same exact plot isn't racist. Hell, you can argue Django is racist towards whites. No one did though because we aren't retarded.   It's almost as if the studio knew SJWs would spew idiocy and cry out racism. So they decided to go against statistical facts and throw in a disproportionate amount of white guys. 62% of Chicago is filled with hispanics and blacks. Chicago has the highest gun violence stats in the country. Blacks/hispanics are also disproportionately impacted by  poverty. Point of all of that is he's in a crime ridden, poor part of Chicago most of the people he shot should have been black, because most of the criminals should be black, statistically speaking.   In the trailer he killed 5 white guys, one black guy and one hispanic guy. The black group he came across, he only gunned down the main leader. If this movie is racist, it's racist towards white people since that's a disproportionate amount considering the location. He's killing PEOPLE because they are criminals. Not killing people because of their  race. Following the literal definition of the word 'racist' it's impossible. Leave it to liberals to argue against the dictionary. But they use feels, not reals.

2017-08-06T07:07:05,"The White version of Shaft? I stay in Chicago, not too long ago we had a story about officers who were acting as a gang with badges. They were prostituting women, selling narcotics, and physically assaulting competition. I don't like bringing race into this but I'm going to answer the forbidden question. Yes, these officers were all White. About a year before that in Chicago we had a Captain that got caught and later admitted to forcing young black males to take plea deals on crimes he knew they didn't commit. One method he used was not giving the falsely arrested food or water for weeks or until they signed the documents.

There are many documented  cases of people surviving hits from a 9mm ( most so called experts/chairborne commandos are ignorant of this).  4. Also, although  it makes for great TV , rapid fire semi auto or full auto fire fire sprays out fire (dispersion) which could injure or kill innocent bystanders.   Then there is the issue of ""over penetration"" which is always a concern when using assault  rifles/spitzer point bullets and rifle type velocities.  5.

But this crap looks like a pretty, light hearted super hero film. Death wish 1974 was dark, very dark. Charles Bronson's version was a nervous wreck, who slowly gains the confidence of a vigilante; who was a creep in the night, a shadow, so much that no one knew him enough to be considered as a hero.

Critics are reviewing this film not on whether it's a good movie or not, but on whether it agrees with their political ideologies. A movie about a straight guy protecting his conventional and perfect family with guns against violent criminals is too much for some people to stomach. I've seen people berate the movie on dialogue where Willis says it's a man's job to protect his family, I mean ffs that is EXACTLY what a man is supposed to do. People dislike it because it ""suggests that the best answer to crime is to defend yourself with force"", YES of course it is, people have a right to protect themselves.
