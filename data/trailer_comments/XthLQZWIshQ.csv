Art is art but it has consequences that most of the actors might not have to live with. I get the point of the film. Down enough to get it. But then again sounding white has also been a move used by blacks and whites to keep people who talk like that naturally down but in our Post Obama BLM world (I voted for O) twice it kinda seems like they're trying to reset the box to get people to fall into boxes and not be themselves. Of course a lot of black people don't see it this way cuz it's funny. Of course white people are curious cuz they listen to whatever black person is on TV with the ""take me to your leader"" mentality. But I get it. Get Out was great. This will be great too.

Not familiar with him. Looking forward to watching this soon. Looks like an awesome film. I just watched Thor Ragnarock with Thompson again. Familar with her work on Westworld. Hated her character in Season 1 and 2, but love her in 3 ( whoever the character is lol. A clone, it seems of Dolores. Whoever she is, I like her. ) Hard to believe I hated someone for so long and love her now lol. Her character ( s ). I got a very good impression from Tessa too watching her interviews recently.  Took a look at Thor again. Great Valkyrie.  Going to look at MIB : International soon also.  Now I'm interested. üëç",1,0,Ignazio Rao,XthLQZWIshQ,0.331123188405797,2020-04-16 11:53:03,False,False
