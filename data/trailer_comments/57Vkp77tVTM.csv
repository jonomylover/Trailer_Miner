It takes place in the same town and for multiple twisters to strike the same place in one day is astronomically rare but not impossible, so technically that part isn't inaccurate. However, for five twisters to be on the ground at once from the same storm and extremely close to each other is impossible. However, two on the ground at the same time is rare but possible since it happened two weeks ago in Nebraska. Also, tornadoes CAN get that big, but again it's rare. The scenes where they are caught in the tornado seem to be pretty accurate though.

2014-07-08T00:41:43,"People will complain about the scientific inaccuracy seen in this trailer. Actually, if you look up some of the tornado outbreaks we've had in the past five years you'll find out that it's more accurate than you think. The El Reno tornado was 2.6 miles wide and had winds of around 300 mph. That's more than enough to pick up trucks and airplanes and completely demolish an airport. I'm sure this movie is inspired by events such as the El Reno, Joplin, Moore, and Tuscaloosa tornadoes. Also, sometimes the found footage genre is a bit ridiculous, especially with horror movies. Who would hold the camera the entire time throughout the ordeal lol. But when it comes to storm chaser, their cameras are rolling ALL THE TIME even inside a tornado. So the found footage aspect actually works in this film. ",0,0,vgames89,57Vkp77tVTM,0.14111111111111113,2014-07-08 00:41:43,True,True

He said ""In an EF4, every single thing is destroyed. There's just, rubble and mud. In an EF5 there is nothing left.""  And he was right. We drove through Moore, OK after the EF5 went through and there was just foundation after foundation, scoured clean of every last thing.   I don't understand how reality isn't scary enough for Hollywood. Instead of terror, debris and confusion we get storms in makeup, rendered to look pretty while they rack up kill points as we eat popcorn. We've already got Twister and The Day After Tomorrow and Sharknado for that.

That couldn't be further from the truth. And it concerns me more that there were REAL chaser consultants, who were either completely ignored or stretched the truth more than just a little.

2014-07-28T03:12:50,"This trailer makes me hurt inside. Don't you see? They're using things that really happened in real disasters where real people died. Take for instance the graduation scene. It was taken from the Joplin 2011 tornado, where the sirens went off at the end of the graduation ceremony, and it was during the ride home that several people were killed. The huge mile wide tornado- also Joplin. During the trailer there were children stuck in a flooding basement. This happened in Moore, Oklahoma, where 7 school children drowned in the basement of their school, where they had been seeking shelter. Lastly, the semi truck trailers being lifted off the ground is based off the events of the Dallas tornado.  Coming from one of these communities, where the disaster that happened not only killed the people we knew and loved, but redefined what life was for every one in the city, (Not to mention destroying at least a third of the city) this really hurts. Why would you ever use the stories of real disasters where PEOPLE DIED in order to make a movie like this? (I know, its cause of the money.....but still!) Yes, this movie might be a thriller/horror movie for some people, but for those of us that come from tornado impacted communities, it's just a reminder of our pain. Even though we've recovered greatly, our pain is still very real. Thanks for taking the time to read, enjoy the movie.",0,0,carolinees23,57Vkp77tVTM,0.1275,2014-07-28 03:12:50,True,True

The power and destruction of these high intensity tornados is awe-inspiring. The closest I've had with such natural disasters was a few strong hurricanes and one twister that came real close to my families house. It wasn't close enough to heavily damage the house but the terrifying sound of the winds blowing through and the debris of the lesser structures left after its passing was impressionable to say the least.,0,0,LunarChibi,57Vkp77tVTM,0.10218749999999997,2014-08-08 19:16:15,False,True
