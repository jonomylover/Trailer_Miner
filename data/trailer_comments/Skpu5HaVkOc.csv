Think of it this way, ever since the first movie, they constantly added new things, basically like an upgrade.  This series is about how a group of racers evolved from the beginning. And yes I was one of those fans that loved the street race plot but you have to think how would it been if it was the same.  I missed it every single time I think of these marvelous movies, but a part of me had to go in order to understand what this smart Crew is in visioning for the future of the franchise.

Second paul ""I'm going to get you out of here"" = real, geez, when I was watching this for the first time and I could tell the difference, it reminded me of how much I miss him. Good job on pissing his legacy away. He should of been killed off in the series, that's how he would of wanted it. Yet you let his trailer trash family attempt at picking up the broken pieces? Disgusting. His brother is too skinny, ugly and shit voice. No offence brother but YOU CANT REPLACE PAUL. The last paul, it's hard to tell. Definitely some cgi in there. If you're smart you keep the asian, ludacris and tyrese, let them act as uncles to the kid and get the kid a skyline to work on, let vin diesel come home and give the kid shit, as they all walk into the house let vin live the moment on camera and accepting that paul is no longer. That my friends, is how you end but begin the fast legacy. Pull in a kid to replace paul walker (as his son in the movie) and get rid of justin bieber and shit teenagers who don't do anything for the world. Paul made an impact in many ways that benefited the community, find someone with a good heart who is into cars and cast them for 2 or 3 more movies. The company gets their money and the story is saved. Good job pissing the series away. I am from arizona and felt that connection with the first movie when you guys were casting out here. In no way shape or form could I imagine you guys fucking it up this much.  I like the rest of these people will be watching the movie for paul, not your shitty cheesy scenes. Get real hollywood, we fell in love with the first movie for a reason, the last few have been garbage.

The crew is now hunted so they go abroad to survive. I liked Vince's cameo. I like that they robbed a vault filled with millions. It was pretty hardcore for the FF franchise it could've served as the epic ending to an epic series. But then FF6 hit and it went down from there. They weren't street racers anymore. They were now more like government mercenaries. And now a horror-director makes FF7. This shit looks more like The Expendables but with cars. The movies aren't even about the cars anymore. FF 1 & 2, it was like 60% cars 40% plot. Even Tokyo Drift went back to the FF roots in a way.  But as every new one was released. The cars were seen more and more seldomly. Now it's just product placement with car brands, hardly any racing, and 80% Michael Bay-worthy action. I hate to say this, but this movie will probably have me excited because it's an FF title and end up making me depressed because it's not even The Fast & The Furious anymore.

Paul Walker died halfway through the filming of Furious 7, but Walker has two younger brothers who stepped up and filled in and finished off Paul Walker's role as Brian O'Connor. The movie makers have superimposed Paul Walker's face onto his brothers for this. It's just the magic of editing and special effect. But I for one is thinking theirs going to be 3 outcomes to this film. Either Paul Walkers Character dies in Furious 7. Or Furious 7 could be the last film in the franchise or even in the next one after Furious 7 Walkers character Brian doesn't want to do any of the stuff they do anymore, either retires or find a job so that he can spend time with his child to see her grow up and also spend time with Mia. That's just some outcomes I think could happen.

Most people have their immediate family, but they have their second family, it could be fitness/religion/college sports/book club/cars/video games/church/crossfit/school/work groups. Sometimes, your second family knows you better than your immediate family.",2,0,lwst82,Skpu5HaVkOc,0.14015151515151514,2014-11-03 01:17:44,True,True

Its the same for music producers they don't make music just for themselves its for the general public too, don't get me wrong yes they enjoy it to but they do it for us cause they want to not cause they half to it's what they enjoy doing.

But right now there are three questions that this trailer is raising to my mind. 1) Where are Lucas Black and Shad Moss' characters Sean Boswell and Twinkie? We know that they likely have been recruited by the crew out of their connection to Han Seoul-Oh, so why are we not seeing them yet? 2) who's that curly haired mystery girl and how will she play into the plot of this movie and/or future movies? And 3) who's the guy being played by Kurt Russell and how will he fit into the plot? I guess I'll have to wait and find out the answers myself, and hope that Sean and Twinkie appear in the second trailer. But I do have an answer to this: will I miss out on seeing this movie? Hells to the NO!! I have not seen any of these films in the theater and I do not intend to miss the last one with Paul.

2014-11-03T08:08:25,"You people don't get the idea here. Its the same people because its the story of a team of very skilled drivers. Obviously the actors don't do the driving, but still people. Understand the concept here. Same ""family"", different adventures. You complain about the series being the same..... Well how many of you have iphones? My guess probably all of you. Every iphone generation looks the same. But yet you still buy one. Why? Because its an iphone, the same thing almost everyone else has. This movie isn't for ppl that are looking for action or romance. Its for people like me that are die hard car enthusiasts' that wanna see awesome stunts, drifting and cars with engines that produce an amount of power and torque that would make most ppl fear for their lives driving these cars.I understand the iphone thing doesn't seem relative, but when it comes down to it..... everyone thinks the next iphone looks different, when in reality they are all the same.If you own an iphone and say this movie is the same.....your just another clueless idiot. What makes every Fast and Furious movie different is that each adventure is different and the style of cars changes. Go ahead and comment, go ahead and say Brian always has a Skyline, Dom always has a Challenger, that's the point, if your gonna be in this type of family you drive the car you adore and it becomes your icon. And before I forget theres cars that are the same way, Corvettes, Mustangs, Lambos, Pocshes, Alfa-romeos, Chargers, Challengers, Ford trucks, Chevy trucks, Dodge trucks.......the list goes on and on. A lot of these vehicles have carried the same style since the day they were introduced, nothing changes much for anything. That's just how it is, but we still love this stuff.

I know I can trust the people working on this franchise to do him justice, and obviously they know what they’re doing with what they've been given. We need to count ourselves lucky to have seen who Paul Walker is and was both as an actor and in his normal life. A person who showed us how to be a real man. Not just a gear head, but a supporting loving partner, a person devoted to fatherhood, not afraid of expressing and living his faith, and living life to the fullest every day. This franchise will be his legacy, and now it's time to pass the mantel to his brother. This looks incredible and more amazing than I could have dreamed. This is what going to the movies is all about. I love what the franchise started out as, changed into, and now it's morphed into an epic series of films representing integrity, family, being who you are and making yourself a better person. Although it's ""Car Porn"" It's so much more than that. It could have gone the way of other films sequels, but has built itself into something Americans can say they’re proud of spreading across all sorts of different cultures. Everybody that watches these films will see themselves in one way or another, represented as strong, respectable characters. I am so incredibly excited for this. Will it be an emotional roller coaster? Yes. But I can't wait to see where it goes next year, and in its sequels. “You know, all that really matters is that the people you love are happy and healthy.

2014-11-04T11:41:47,"I'm here to clear up any confusion, first off Paul Walker is dead, yes that is him in the film why? because they got up to the last scene with Paul before his crash/death, then they had his brother Cody Walker who may i remind you looks a lot like Paul step in and replace him using CGI in order for them to finish the film. However it evolved to them re-writing the script slightly therefore moving the original trailer/film release to a later date. Furthermore and this is a SPOILER ALERT, because Paul is now gone, they had to do something in the film in favor of his death, so they're most likely going to kill off his Character whom we all know and love as Brian O Connors just like how they killed off Han in Tokyo Drift which basically should have been done after FF6 came. Also last SPOILER ALERT i believe that guy from Tokyo drift named Shaun comes back for FF7 too but that all i know for now.

2014-11-04T17:30:28,"    I see one little problem with the whole The Fast and the Furious trilogy. The majority of  most ""wanna be"" street racers  that watch this type of Hollywood hype and special effects,in the name of ""Entertainment"" tend to believe it is real!  Many impressionable or ""Special"" individuals, seem to think ""That looks easy"". I bet I can do that with my little rice rocket? You've seen these idiots on the freeways and suburban streets.                       You know,the folks in the cars that have both the obnoxiously loud sub woofer stereo instead of a trunk,complete with the coffee can exhaust that makes the car sound like glorified lawn tractor, vibrating every nut and bolt and body panel loose on the car. All the while, forcing their fellow motorists,and the general public to be subjected to their noise,cutting in and out of traffic with a total disregard for safety. Many of these same idiots cause fatal accidents. All because the think they are Paul Walker,or Vin Diesel. I feel its that kind of mind set that probably cost Paul Walker his life?                                Whether or not you agree,or disagree, It's food for thought?  I'm just sayin.",1,0,77cordobaguy,Skpu5HaVkOc,0.11408076050933191,2014-11-04 17:30:28,True,True

That my friends, is how you end but begin the fast legacy. Pull in a kid to replace paul walker (as his son in the movie) and get rid of justin bieber and shit teenagers who don't do anything for the world. Paul made an impact in many ways that benefited the community, find someone with a good heart who is into cars and cast them for 2 or 3 more movies.

Don't you have a sharp outlook? This trailer has plenty of MISTAKES & IMAGINARY scenes.  1. At 0:35, when the car gets unattached from the parachute, how it landed safely on the road? The parachute could have taken the car anywhere else. It's not a airplane though.  2. At 0:51, there's no bombs noticeable in the backdoor of the bus but right at 0:53 the door blasts and 3 men get affected. How is that possible?  3. At 1:11, when there are other men alive in the bus which crashed and was about to fall, how did Paul Walker only tried to get out of it? It seems that other men are interested to die. Defaq!!!  4. RIGHT at 1:27, Paul is far feet away from that car, but did he managed to catch that car (at 1:29)? Is he a superman?  5. Han didn't die in Tokyo Drift and not in FF6 either, but how he died in F7 (at 1:34)?  6. At 2:06, how did Dwayne Johnson able to break his left fractured hand at start fighting? Gross!!! I don't want to live in this planet anymore.  A trailer shouldn't have a single mistake, but see, here are 6 mistakes. Now let me see which person has the GUTS TO RECTIFY THESE MISTAKES by replying in this comment",6,23,Himanis Das,Skpu5HaVkOc,0.02892867822966506,2014-11-06 17:30:15,True,True

2014-11-10T03:52:11,"Amazing! Tragic what happened to Paul. Fortunately he's in a better place. I know I can trust the people working on this franchise to do him justice, and obviously they know what they’re doing with what they've been given. We need to count ourselves lucky to have seen who Paul Walker is and was both as an actor and in his normal life. A person who showed us how to be a real man. Not just a gear head, but a supporting loving partner, a person devoted to fatherhood, not afraid of expressing and living his faith, and living life to the fullest every day. This franchise will be his legacy, and now it's time to pass the mantel to his brother. This looks incredible and more amazing than I could have dreamed. This is what going to the movies is all about. I love what the franchise started out as, changed into, and now it's morphed into an epic series of films representing integrity, family, being who you are and making yourself a better person. Although it's ""Car Porn"" It's so much more than that. It could have gone the way of other films sequels, but has built itself into something Americans can say they’re proud of spreading across all sorts of different cultures. Everybody that watches these films will see themselves in one way or another, represented as strong, respectable characters. I am so incredibly excited for this.

Like that whole first half of the trailer had a cut to a new angle like every 2 sec and, for me, it makes it difficult to follow the action. I think action movies and sequences look better with longer shots to where you can fully tell what's going on. That's my massive complaint for most action movies nowadays.

I think of stuff like Instagram, GTA V... and it shows me just how important Paul was for a generation of young men. He was like 'the guy' to make movies we thought were cool. He was THE GUY that brought back tuning and racing into movies, and he was the car scene guy in Hollywood.... hell, even Takers was one of the only decent heist films since Heat and other than the Town.  he was just probably the most relate-able and coolest guy in Hollywood for an entire generation of young guys that like cars",0,0,Sino Deutsch,Skpu5HaVkOc,0.22833333333333336,2014-11-30 23:23:02,True,True

As an entertainer and actor Paul Walker was really good, but aside from that he was a humanitarian, a philanthropist, and an activist who personally went to places hit by natural disasters to help the people suffering, and in great need.

One cast member is dead for driving recklessly (maybe even drunk like that buffoon from Jackass who also lost his life a few years ago) in real life. Kids are emulating what they see from this movie and there are thousands of kids losing their lives cuz of it. How many more kids have to die? And the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) has lost my respect now since he decided to join in on the action. Why, Rock...WHY?!  You're so much better than this crap, DJ! You don't need the flippin' money that bad. I can't say I blame anyone picketing cinemas and protesting when this film hits theaters. Wish I could join in on the picketing. It deserves it badly. It'll be only a matter of time when another kid dies from mimicking the action from this franchise. And if the parents of the deceased kids who died while trying to ape the same speeding stunts ought to sue the living shite out of the creators and directors of this film until they are wiped out flat broke. Maybe that'll serve them right not to make another sucky movie from this sucky franchise. Another reason why I can't stand this franchise is cuz of a real life d-bag like Obama supporter Vin Diesel who is a flaming liberal. Know what?!! I hope this movie tanks big time at the box office. Hope it gets lots of Razzie nominations. I'd rather watch Grey's Anatomy The Motion Picture over this garbage...and I HATE Grey's Anatomy with a blue passion. All I have to say is shame on you parents who let your kids go out and see these BS movies. Are you really anxious to see your kids go out and get killed by using unsafe speed on the highway because they wanted to do the same thing the actors in this film did?

However, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), is after Dom and his crew, seeking revenge for his brother's defeat and putting the entire crew in danger once more. After learning of Han's death, the crew sets out to find the man who killed one of their own, before he finds them first. Deckard breaks into Hobbs' DSS office to investigate Toretto's crew. He and Hobbs fight and Hobbs is sent to the hospital but Shaw escapes. A bomb explodes and destroys Toretto's house simultaneously as Han is killed in Tokyo. Toretto visits Hobbs in the hospital where he learns Shaw is out for revenge. Toretto visits Tokyo where he meets Sean who gives him personal effects found at Han's crash. Back in Los Angeles at Han's funeral Toretto sees a Maserati observing and chases after the vehicle. After a head-on collision in a game of chicken Toretto and Shaw fight but Shaw slips away when Frank Petty and his covert ops team arrive. He informs Toretto that he will assist Toretto in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that can hack into any device connected to any network. Toretto, Brian, and their crew drive cars out of an airplane and later crash a penthouse party in Abu Dhabi to get the device back and free its creator, Ramsey. They attempt to capture Shaw but are ambushed by Jakande and his militants, who obtain God's Eye in the surprise attack. Petty is injured and Toretto and Brian decide to take on Shaw in their hometown of Los Angeles. They use Ramsey to hack into God's Eye while keeping her mobile in a series of vehicles. With the help of Hobbs they are able to subdue and capture Shaw and kill Jakande. Toretto nearly dies and as he regains consciousness Letty tells him her memories have returned. At the beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Toretto and the rest of their crew appreciate his happiness and acknowledge that he is best off retired with his family. Toretto silently leaves and Brian catches up with him at a stop sign.

It makes no sense, the acting is terrible, the dialogue is terrible, and the action is surprisingly terrible (shaky-cam, lack of focus, effects over actual choreography) as well. It really is a shame to waste money on making or seeing this movie.   Amazing foibles: Half CG Paul Walker is like watching a Japanese ""real doll"" placed in an action movie (sorry Paul). The camera angles and dialogue surrounding him is so surreal. I was so distracted by the efforts to pretend he was alive for the whole movie that I couldn't focus on the movie, not that you need to focus to watch this nonsense. Also, the plot makes no sense whatsoever. I can't even describe it. They try to find a device to just track down Jason Statham, yet he finds the crew at every other scene. Also, for some reason they need to drive cars out of a plane to reach a bus transport, yet Jason Statham manages to be at the same place without falling out of plane. Why did they need to do it? They didn't. This whole movie did not need to happen.   Vin Diesel is old, and just rambles on about family and the streets and other nonsense. HE WEARS A WHITE CUT OFF TO HIS OWN WEDDING. Classic Vin...   Also, they go to Tokyo as if there is no time interruption from Tokyo drift, yet the Tokyo drift actor is 10 years older than he was in that movie.

""You know, all that really matters is that the people you love are happy and healthy. Everything else is just sprinkles on a sundae."" - Paul Walker.   He did such good to this world and lived his life to the fullest that some did not recognize till his death was announced, but many always knew what good he did for others and strangers that he didn't even know. He today is still an motivation for me and many others to do what they love and fight for anything you believe in.  ""It's not about workings anymore, its about doing work i can be proud of."" -Paul Walker.   I'm honestly in so much shock that he is gone it is heartbreaking. I have looked up to him for years and still will for the rest of my life. He was such a fun,loving,humble guy that passed away from a tragic death way to young. If you want to remember this guy as a selfless caring guy then watch this movie.

You can't expect to have a 'realistic' close fight between someone as thin as Michelle Rodriguez beating Ronda Rousey... or picking Jason Statham as the bad guy against Vin Diesel. Especially the main bad guy being Statham, was the biggest flaw in this movie, why not pick someone like Hulk Hogan? I just can't see Statham as a featured bad guy in a movie filled with buff guys... This movie was basically a rerun of the 4th movie with less action, the only reason this movie served any large amount of attention was due to the unfortunate accident to Paul Walker making this the last movie featuring Paul Walker. Overall, I would give the movie a 7/10, it wasn't a very bad movie but it didn't have anything unique other than the cars being dropped off from the sky.

2015-05-25T01:48:20,"In my opinion; I loved the way the director ended the movie/ ""retired"" Brian. Every time I hear Wiz' song I down myself in a puddle of tears.   I'd actually love to see Dom and his team (excluding Brian and Mia of course) move on. Because the franchise itself hasn't actually been ended properly.  *SPOILER ALERT*     The movie is all about D. Shaw, Shaw's older brother, who's now after Dom and his team (including Hobbs), because they killed his younger brother. By taking revenge on the loss of his younger brother, Deckard kills Han, blows Dom's house up with a time-bomb and injures Hobbs.  BUT THE WHOLE MOVIE IS ABOUT DOM'S/HOBBS' REVENGE...  So they've taken revenge, locked up Deckard and Brian retired... but what now? Their lives go on. In F&F 5, every member of the crew got about 11 million USD. Those two Hispanic guys lost all their money in the same movie. I'm not an expert, but I think Roman and Tej must have gone bankrupt already. They're probably all back on the streets again, right?  *And still a lot of questions remain a mystery, such as: *  What happened to Ramsey and Tej? Those two were like the perfect couple! But we never  heard of them anymore... or what about Sean, you know, from Tokyo drift?   This is what would be a pretty good followup of the story really quick:  Dom or someone else from his team/family gets in trouble and Dom needs his team again. He calls Brian but he won't join of course because he has a family now, but he'll see what he can do. Later he tells Dom his nephew is available and just like Brian, he also is a very good driver.  - Sean finds a way to go to America and replaces Han - Paul Walker's real life brother should be Brian's nephew or something like that - Hispanic guys join again  You can't just end an amazing franchise like that 'Cause you know...

There were some corny scenes: Toretto slow cinematic closeup during the house explosion, the rock saying ""im am the cavalry,"" and incessant ""women.""  Stunts were unrealistic. How did Toretto survive all previous crashes? Especially, falling of a mountain yet almost dies in the end from a less destructive one. The rock sudden recovery at the end. Also, them given access to a to super computer called the ""gods eye,"" by a man who generously lends out an confidential governmental tool and has a FULL ARMY... I mean they get access to this stuff just like that. Plus unnecessary actors like Bow Wow and Rhonda Rousey (fight scene was awesome tho). The mournful scene after Torreto crash was right, but it felt kind of awkward to see Letty cry. In the Fast n Furious serious she's portrayed as being hardcore and less emotional. However, that's her husband. I understand... hard to say that too lol. last i think it diverted from the Fast and Furious theme: too much explosions and guns and less cars and racing.

I feel nothing but regret. last time we spoke was not pleasant, despite how much I want it, he will never be anything other than a thieving junky totally incapable of basic human compassion for another, unscrupulous and malevolent.

It is made up of all walks of life, from 16-year-olds to 45-year-olds.  They are basically  just a big group of outcasts and wannabes and they usually claim that their ""underground racing club"" is the best around and most will usually claim that they are nationwide (yeah right lol). Their ""races"" usually will consist of 2-4 cars..most never bet over $100 per race because that's all their parents would give them..but 9 out of 10 times they don't bet anything and they don't even make the races interesting.  It's almost always just a 100 yard stretch of road at best.

This may be useful to the people who want an honest ""short review"" because I am a long term fan now. Maybe a little too late for that, but... yeah, anyway:  First, the good part: I've enjoyed watching this movie. You can lag Your eye, on girls and on cars here and there. Movie features many great actors and I mean new ones by that. Statham (still proving he's the badass here), Tony Jaa, Kurt Russell, You can't go wrong with them. Also, as many, if not everyone knows, Paul Walker isn't with us anymore. The creators decided to give a proper message to his fans at the last minutes of the movie and it is captured beautifully. It is a ""good goodbye"". I mean, You have to respect that.  It is just in overall a good movie, good acting, testosterone level skyrockets sometimes, You can definitely enjoy it.  And now the bad part: You can enjoy it... if You want to watch an ACTION movie. Because, cars? Girls? Nope. Just an eye candy. This movie has nothing to do with RACING anymore. Well, it has nothing to do with it since Fast and Furious 4. You can turn a blind eye and still like this movie... but then another thing shows up. Some scenes are just so damn ridiculous it hurts my sense of logic. You can say that just by looking at this trailer. It is crazy, to the point it's stupid. You have to turn Your brain off, because if You don't, it will get in Your way and question everything in life.  So, this is a good action movie. And don't try to see anything more in it, because it isn't trying to be something more. If we're talking about the whole series and racing, and girls and what this movie was about at the beginning, You will be disappointed.

2016-10-19T01:16:36,"I recently got into the Fast and Furious movies. It took a while. F&F 1 through Tokyo Drift didn't do much for me (Tokyo Drift is my least favourite in the series), but when I saw Fast and Furious 4, I began to really get into it, when I saw Brian O'Conner and Dominic Toretto become a team again. When Brian basically turned in his badge at the end of F&F 4, I knew I was gonna be in for something good. After seeing all 7 movies, I can safely say I love them all. Fantastic series. Right now, for favourites, I'm torn between Fast Five and Furious 7. For action and extreme awesomeness, Fast Five wins in a landslide, but when it comes to the film's background, and in terms of film production, Furious 7 wins. To this day, I am incredibly impressed with how they were able to finish this entire movie without Paul Walker. Incredible... I don't think a movie's ending has ever made me cry more than Furious 7.

Also didn't like how they let him live as a prisoner in the end after he killed Han.... and then to top it off in 8 they fight along side him... WTF! Then Dom having a kid with that other chick...
