2014-07-12T06:42:54,"Ok so I see a few people arguing about this so I want to just make this clear. This myth about using 10% of our brains is BOTH TRUE AND UNTRUE depending on how you look at it; however, we use all parts to their fullest potential. Not all of our brain is firing at once but that doesn't mean we would somehow be smarter if they did. You see, the problem is that most people think of the brain as being the same as a computer meaning that there is a certain amount of processing power with a certain amount of that being devoted to whatever ""program"" is currently being utilized. The reality is that a computer and a brain could not be more alien from each other. With the brain, each neuron has a specific role that it plays whether that be conscious or unconscious and these roles can be surprisingly specific. To give an example, in the visual cortex there are neurons specifically tuned to the orientation of lines that fall on certain parts of our retina (they're linked to our perception of these orientations). These neurons are tuned to vertical lines, horizontal lines, and everything in between and only fire when a line falls on the retina in their specifically tuned orientation. Now naturally because there are not always all orientations falling on all parts of the retina at the same time, its a logical assumption to make that all these neurons shouldn't be firing at once. In fact, knowing this, its a safe assumption to say that you don't want all these neurons firing at once. There are actually people who have a disorder that causes large chunks of the brain to fire in synchronicity. This disorder is called epilepsy. Now I know the idea of there being some ""huge, untapped neurological resource"" within each of us sounds cool, but the reality is that it's just not there. While there are things we can do to stimulate axon growth/synapse branching that will make us smarter, this process is typically gradual and no magic drug or pill is somehow going to suddenly make us 10 times smarter.",0,0,Benjamin McAravey,bN7ksFEVO9U,0.10332181259600615,2014-07-12 06:42:54,True,True

2014-07-12T08:11:39,"Here guys, I wiki'd it for you! :D  Neurologist Barry Gordon describes the myth as laughably false, adding, ""we use virtually every part of the brain, and that [most of] the brain is active almost all the time"". Neuroscientist Barry Beyerstein sets out seven kinds of evidence refuting the ten percent myth:  Studies of brain damage: If 90% of the brain is normally unused, then damage to these areas should not impair performance. Instead, there is almost no area of the brain that can be damaged without loss of abilities. Even slight damage to small areas of the brain can have profound effects.  Brain scans have shown that no matter what we're doing, our brains are always active. Some areas are more active at any one time than others, but unless we have brain damage, there is no one part of the brain that is absolutely not functioning. Evolution: The brain is enormously costly to the rest of the body, in terms of oxygen and nutrient consumption. It can require up to 20% of the body's energy—more than any other organ—despite making up only 2% of the human body by weight. If 90% of it were unnecessary, there would be a large survival advantage to humans with smaller, more efficient brains. If this were true, the process of natural selection would have eliminated the inefficient brains. It is also highly unlikely that a brain with so much redundant matter would have evolved in the first place.  Brain imaging: Technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allow the activity of the living brain to be monitored. They reveal that even during sleep, all parts of the brain show some level of activity. Only in the case of serious damage does a brain have ""silent"" areas. Localization of function: Rather than acting as a single mass, the brain has distinct regions for different kinds of information processing. Decades of research have gone into mapping functions onto areas of the brain, and no function-less areas have been found.  Microstructural analysis: In the single-unit recording technique, researchers insert a tiny electrode into the brain to monitor the activity of a single cell. If 90% of cells were unused, then this technique would have revealed that. Neural disease: Brain cells that are not used have a tendency to degenerate. Hence if 90% of the brain were inactive, autopsy of adult brains would reveal large-scale degeneration.  Another evolutionary argument is that, given the historical risk of death in childbirth associated with the large brain size (and therefore skull size) of humans, there would be a strong selection pressure against such a large brain size if only 10% was actually in use.",0,0,Miming Cat,bN7ksFEVO9U,0.04299242424242425,2014-07-12 08:11:39,True,True

Homo technica, and pretty much anything with a brain or nucleus of some kind, uses all of its processing power to survive. Every single organism on this Earth evolved to survive. So, riddle me this, if any organism had the capacity to do this (which is impossible because of Newton's laws of motion, Einstein's theory of relativity, the law of conservation of mass, the law of conservation of energy, and the law of conservation of momentum) then they would have become the dominant species, seen everything else as resource thieves, killed everything they saw as inconveniences to their survival, and then do whatever the fuck they wanted. Don't get me wrong. I get that this is fiction, but whoever made this is either dumb enough to blindly accept this concept without question, or doesn't understand that people are smarter than this. However, I'm not entirely sure of this after going though the comment section here. We've already had a film based on this fallacy (though I can't remember the name right now), but it wan't nearly as fantastical as this one (I mean, seriously, a girl gets some drugs leaked into her circulatory system and all of a sudden she's a god?). I hope this helps disprove anyone's thoughts on this ""we only use 10% of our brains"" bullcrap.

2014-07-18T12:41:55,"We use the whole brain, and each portion of the brain controls a different part. from how we behave is part of our frontal lope. How we process language and words/images happen on opposite sides of the brain. Even the most primitive portion of the brain controls are base instincts of being human. The whole brain is always active, and not one portion turns off. Depending on what we are doing can cause the brain to become more active than what it was, such as our motor skills compared to when we walk then run. But much more is going on while we run then that small section of the brain, such as imagery, balance, touch, energy processing, and auto response system that help regulate the body. Grey matter is the portion of the brain that relates to what we have learned, and can vary by individual. for example, if a child who read a lot, studied, or did more creative things like art and music will have more grey matter. It all depends on what you know, and how you learn. The brain is always working, and can only workout when you learn. If you don't learn your brain is still 100% active. You can study and catch up, but it will be harder for you to do so. ",0,0,alvin webb,bN7ksFEVO9U,0.07608695652173912,2014-07-18 12:41:55,False,True

Nothing but white color. Then her body starts turning black while she's just going back in time. She went back in time and saw dinos and how the earth was made and stuff like that to the point where the universe was created. When she gets to the point where nothing existed she turned completely black. Oh! While she was turning back that Asian guy was gonna kill her but when she turned completely black she disappeared.
