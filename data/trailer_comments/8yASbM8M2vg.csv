I want you to tell them how heating seawater to steam in a drill pipe instead of using drilling fluid is a proposed method for extracting methane hydrate. I want you to tell them this all happened before during the Ixtock I disaster. I want you to tell them the truth about the situation with methane hydrate on this planet. I want you to tell them about the methane hydrate research and development act. I want you to tell them about the international joint industry project (JIP) surrounding methane hydrate research and development and the meeting you had in 2003. I want you to tell them about the concerns expressed about behind pipe gas migration and how similar the timeline of events of this disaster are similar to the JIP concerns in 2003. I want you to tell them about Leg 3 of the project being planned for Mississippi Canyon. I WANT YOU TO TELL THESE PEOPLE THE TRUTH ABOUT HOW MUCH ICE IMPREGNATED WITH METHANE EXISTS UNDER THE OCEANS HOW MANY COUNTRIES ARE HAVING DISPUTES ABOUT SEAFLOOR MINING RIGHTS AND WHAT THIS ICE THAT BURNS IF YOU LIGHT IT ON FIRE IS DOING TO OUR ATMOSPHERE AS IT DISSOCIATES AND BUBBLES UP OUT OF THE OCEAN ALL OVER THIS PLANET! Look it up people. That is how I learned every single bit of it. I heard them talking about the methane hydrate collecting in the Top Hat and I started learning. Back in 1979 Ixtoc I disaster they called it a Sombrero and it collected Methane Hydrate too. Every bit of this better be in that movie or you are LYING to America.

2016-09-30T13:03:26,"In an irony fit for the big screen, executives were onboard Deepwater on 20 April when the explosions wracked the vessel, celebrating seven straight years without serious accidents. However, US federal data revealed that ""three of every four incidents that triggered federal investigations into safety and other problems on deepwater drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico since 2008 have been on rigs operated by Transocean.""   Mike Williams, an electronics technician (and Wahlberg's character in the cinematic take on the events) later testified he had raised concerns about safety.  The resulting oil spill saw around 780,000 cubic meters of oil gush into the waters, impacting 180,000 square kilometers of ocean. The sludge spread, affecting beaches, wetlands, and wildlife.  Oil gushed out of the well for a staggering 87 days, as repeated attempts to plug the hole failed. Other efforts to control the spill included controlled burns, setting the seas on fire, while skipper ships attempted to scoop the oil out of the water. The leak was plugged on July 15 and eventually, on September 19 the well was declared ""officially dead"" by US Coast Guard admiral Thad Allen, after cement was pumped in through a relief well.  The final report into the Deepwater disaster found BP was most to blame, though also held Transocean and contractor Halliburton to account - the latter for laying faulty cement in the well to begin with.  However, it ultimately determined BP made ""a series of decisions that complicated cementing operations, added risk, and may have contributed to the ultimate failure of the cement job"", which in turn allowed such a catastrophic volume of oil to flood the ocean. Darkly, BP's shares actually rose after the report, reportedly based on the fact it wasn't solely responsible for the disaster.  The impact of the spill is still being felt, though. The Deepwater Horizon incident ended up being the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry, and recent studies have found the pollution has lead to deformities in fish stocks in the area. The ecosystem is expected to take years to recover.",51,5,Mike Messiah,8yASbM8M2vg,-0.019565217391304346,2016-09-30 13:03:26,False,True

People died trying to help others many stay behind to make sure people can live and try to calm the fire down. This event will Haunt these men a Women until they die. They are HEROES!!! Plus this movie showed how this affected animal life in a few Scenes but the focus is not the eco system here its the people who helped others survive these events. Its like going into 13 Hours expecting that we will see a political thriller that shows why hilary didnt sent help or something when its not the focus The focus of the film is men who went againts others to do whats right.

Did people want an over exaggeration of a real event, where the victims lives and those survivors and their families are belittled. I certainly hope not.  What we should be looking at is Corporate Society and their overriding love of the almighty dollar, the total disregard of a human life. Which this movie had touched on a number of times.  Since this tragic event BP have done everything they could to minimize their contribution in compensation to those directly affected and the greater community at large. World wide their subsidiaries have changed some of their brandings. And by this and the actions of this they are still only worried about their profit margin.  Even with their so called contributions to charitable organisations, which I call a fallacy when they claim tax credits back, to be a whitewash or glossing over some of the actions this company and many others are doing to the people and environment.
