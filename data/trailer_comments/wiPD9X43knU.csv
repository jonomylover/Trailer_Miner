2017-07-11T23:12:39,"she relives the same day over and over and she and the killer are the only changing variables seeing as the killer has multiple plans for killing her. She's also extremely well known and probably a college plastic mean girl. So everyone's naturally got a little saltiness to go along with what beef they have and want to get back at her for some mean bully shit. So for the sake of this, what if it's not a killer. What if it's killer(s)? The house was boarded up, granted deadlocks are easy as fuck to work around in a number of silent ways. There was also the car, so one, killing a cop would immediately grab the attention of the police. This person either A.) Doesn't care about being caught or with the fact the deaths are always changing and evolving and they manage to get her alone (or take out that one police man that is unfortunate enough to be near her)  B.) being reset along with the chick. I'm also presuming the chick was attacked after arrival 1:41 (she got hurt because she got hit by a bus with another girl) , survived and got rushed to a hospital seeing as she was wearing a hospital gown at 1:30 and was hiding from them in a parking lot. So the killer most likely visited her at the hospital or went along with her by ambulance to keep track of her and keep an alibi. Otherwise there's no way they'd know what room she was in, or there are multiple people working together to kill her and giving the masked one information to track her. 1:32 is most likely a dorm or office desk, probably where she discovers the actual number of people involved thinking she figured out who it was only to second guess herself. Also with all of those keys they have access to doors that unless they were not connected to the school or a particular building would not have access to, most likely a member of the faculty or intern. They're also most likely in the popular clique because they're attendance to parties would not be questioned, and some of the places where she dies and if I'm right the water death was by a dock. The dock, the woods, and an elevator shaft (the building it's in is probably uninhabited and a hangout area for delinquents or drunken college students, perhaps even a rundown hospital that could be an alternate reason for the hospital gown... some sort of test of courage) These are all popular spots to have parties with an unprecedented amount of booze meaning there won't be a lot of witnesses that could testify if they manage to point out who the masked person is. With the police thing and the naked walk of anything but shame she was trying to be put in jail to keep herself out of the killer's reach with how much security and officers there would be. Also has access to what appears to be a black charger, whether grand theft auto or actual killer's car, they have the irony of setting the gas on fire with a birthday candle most likely sending her that cake at the end.",0,0,Chelsey Carter,wiPD9X43knU,0.09003684807256236,2017-07-11 23:12:39,True,True

2017-09-21T03:56:55,"In before reading the comments, here is my take on who could be the killer and why (long read)  1) the girl herself - my theory is that for each time she dies, she really dies in that timeline, but her consciousness drifts into an different timeline, in which the previous timeline's past is soon to be the present. This creates multiple timelines and thus creating an illusion that the girl is stuck in an endless loop.  The reason why the girl herself is the suspect in this theory is because while the consciousness of the girl that is killed again and again, there is another her, possibly her future self that is somehow in the present, that has lost her sanity due to the repeating timelines and unconsciously ends up being the ""loop"" by killing herself in a sense, possibly believing that killing herself breaks the loop.  2) one of her friends/roomies - following the theory about the consciousness drifting, it could be that one of the girl's close buds had experienced the same thing as the girl is about to experience. In a more simple explanation, there are some people who doesn't want to feel alone in unusual experiences that they had, so they inflict the same thing on others. Their memory about the day probably resets like all other when the girl dies, or maybe it doesn't, the latter possibility which could be the reason why the killer is doing this.  There's a ton of loopholes on this theory so uh I don't know how to fill those up.  3) the nice guy - I think this is the most cliche plottwists in most mysteries. The guy could be a secret sociopath, and intended to kill the girl whether he was aware of the looping timelines or not. He is constantly helping the girl in solving the mystery behind the time loops despite intending to kill her in the end anyways. His memories about the day resets like everyone else's, but his intentions stays all the same.  The question is, out of all the people in the campus, why the girl? Well seeing that the girl's a popular one, it could be that the guy wanted the satisfaction of seeing everyone else suffer emotionally at the loss of someone like her.  3) someone else completely outside the trailer - hey this vid ain't the whole movie so there's way more possibility",0,0,Jay Gets Creative,wiPD9X43knU,0.08356481481481483,2017-09-21 03:56:55,True,True

Everyone in the comment section is saying why they think it's this one certain character and they have some pretty good evidence only from the trailer. But here's the thing, some of you say it's the guy that's helping her, with really good evidence behind it. Same with candle girl, sneaky lil biyotch girl and etc. you know how she says ""pretty much the entire school knows it's my birthday"" when trying to find the murderer? Well, what if the entire school is in on it? Just a figure of speech I'm only talking about a certain group. It might be decided that someone different kills her that one day from the choices she makes that day. Think about it, they gave the guy some serious trippy posters in his room in which all of the evidence points to him, but wait, sneaky little biyotch girl wears the same shoes as the killer, but wait, happy birthday girl (which I consider candle girl) is the only one in the trailer you see with a candle. And y'all remember the killer dropping the candle on the gasoline to kill her right? In conclusion, everybody could be in on it and it would make a killer twist if it were true.
