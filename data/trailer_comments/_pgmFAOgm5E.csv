(Remember, I'm now a grown up almost out of college and is STILL a proud Disney fan!!! )  On one hand, traditional Disney (the classic cartoons) are all happy, cheerful and full of cheesy romance. I actually like this turn. Taking the villains point of view into perspective. I mean we ALL know Sleeping Beauty's story, but I've always wondered about Maleficent...  I kinda like how they did her story for a change and dammit! I LIKE this semi dark turn Disney's attempting for Maleficent (Even though they should keep the tradition of that cartoon style they're famous for and NOT the live action shows that I PRAY don't wind up like those reality shows on MTV *shivers*). She DESERVES her own movie!  She was one of my favorite scary Disney villains that gave me nightmares (next to captain hook and Cruella De Ville) Granted they already have live action films, but still. Imagine Captain Hooks story, or the Queen of Hearts (ok, maybe not her) or even Ursula!  ... DO URSULA NEXT DISNEY!!!!!

2014-01-28T02:32:35,"Robert Stromberg I can't wait to see your brilliance on screen. I'll be using one of several movie passes I have to go see this lol. Angelina Jolie was indeed an excellent choice for the role of Disney's most famous villain. Besides a background story for Maleficent crossed with a retelling of the original Sleeping Beauty Disney film is fairly genius. After all if you go back and rewatch Sleeping Beauty (since this movie was more or less viewed by many during childhood and hasn't been revisited recently). The main thing viewers will easily enough notice is that the villain got more screen time and made more of an impression then the princess and was more well viewed in marks of favoritism then Aurora. Who in truth only had 18mins on vocal screentime followed by at least 5-7mins of nonvocal screentime. It just didn't make as much of an impact in story as it's two fairy tale predecessors. Don't get me wrong I love the original movie for it's voice acting, animation, and the characters that were created, but I'm looking very forward to Malifecent. This movie will in no way replace in my mind and heart Sleeping Beauty since I grew up with it. But this will definitely be a movie that will give a great deal of focus to both Aurora and Maleficent and to the other important characters as well (though not as much as Aurora and Maleficent) which I definitely like. It'll be a new addition to Disney favorites in my heart since Maleficent is indeed my favorite villain from Disney with Ursula from TLM 2nd and Demona from Gargoyles being 3rd. Besides even though Maleficent is based off of the evil fairy from the original version she herself is an original product of Disney and deserves a glimpse into her story since Disney never really touches upon the villains like they do the heroes. Only real villain from Disney I can say that actually got real focus into their background was Demona from Gargoyles, but that's because Greg Weisman. It be nice if this could open up some movie ideas (not live action) for other villains such as Ursula since the villains are just as important and a background on said villains would be fairly enjoyable.",8,0,TwiKou89,_pgmFAOgm5E,0.20035650623885914,2014-01-28 02:32:35,True,True

I'm worried that Jolie won't be doing justice to, arguably, the greatest Disney villain. She doesn't look that much like Maleficent with her wide jaw, white (as in white person) coloured skin, weird greenish irises, fuller figure, shorter height, and her huge, perfect mouth/ teeth. The original had a softer jaw but a more prominent chin, the hue of her skin was a pale grey-green, she had tiny black pupils set in huge yellow eyeballs, and her slender, tall frame made her appear to tower over others- her appearance just completely commanded authority. Jolie's voice is ok but isn't as scary as the original- I can't feel the power she's supposed to have when she speaks and am unable to tell at times whether she's supposed to be the Mistress of All Evil or a character in Downton Abbey. To top it all off, she has a bit of burnt wood in place of her ornate staff, a very boring outfit and her horns look like they've been wrapped in someone's old PVC outfit.

May the LORD rebuke this evil. Do not confuse my words, this character, is very real and it needs to be dealt with severely because it will have no equal and will not submit to any kind of authority or compassion of any kind.

I never could finish Sleeping Beauty as a kid, to this day I haven't seen the end because her character genuinely bothered me and still kind of does. Most Disney villains either had some form of lightheartedness to them or felt vulnerable in a sense. However, the writers were able to take this character and make her maintain the presence of an ominous threat inside and outside of her franchise. Hell, I remember being creeped out just watching her walk out of the shadows in House of Mouse or Kingdom hearts.

I've seen movies with a lot more strategic fuedal battling leading to a castle and inside of a castle with the layout. This movie doesn't really show anything new, and there's a lot lacking in it. While it's got the digital effects they aren't that great as there's nothing that creative in it and it lacks spirit. From what I've seen so far the big name actors and actresses for stuff like this they get paid very well but I noticed their movies aren't that big a budget. I think there movies make more money on their name, and so they make more money since the money doesn't go into the budget. That doesn't always work though. This is like one of the newer Tim Burton movies of all of the flaws of some of his modern movies in that it's very mundane in a lot of ways.

Lana Del Rey is absolutely amazing and, as with a lot of her songs, her voice provides an eerie tone that helps create the darker feel of the film. My concern now is that Meleficent will be painted as some kind of hero rather than a villain. I'm all for Disney being darker but it feels like they're holding back and making it seem like Meleficent had good intentions (it also seems as though she befriends the princess) Here's hoping Meleficent betrays at least SOMEONE and that we see as little entirely-green-screen-environment BS (Star Wars prequels, Alice in Wonderland) as possible.",0,1,Noah Bessell,_pgmFAOgm5E,0.1195616883116883,2014-02-01 02:47:34,True,True

2014-02-23T05:21:47,"""Maleficent"" explores the untold story of Disney's most iconic villain from the 1959 classic Sleeping Beauty and the elements of her betrayal that ultimately turn her pure heart to stone. Driven by revenge and a fierce desire to protect the moors over which she presides, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) cruelly places an irrevocable curse upon the human king's newborn infant Aurora. As the child grows, Aurora (Elle Fanning) is caught in the middle of the seething conflict between the forest kingdom she has grown to love and the human kingdom that holds her legacy. Maleficent realizes that Aurora may hold the key to peace in the land and is forced to take drastic actions that will change both worlds forever.""[3",2,0,A B,_pgmFAOgm5E,0.04841269841269841,2014-02-23 05:21:47,True,True

But more than that; it looks like it's going to reveal that she has a sympathetic background - which while is a good twist, it is a bit bizarre in and of itself, considering how evil the character is.  But it DOES look good - despite becoming a War movie like Narnia or that Burton Wonderland movie. And hearing ""Once Upon a Dream"" sung that way is so...hauntingly beautiful. And Angelina Jolie is very fitting for the role; very beautiful. Though I'm surprised that they didn't paint her skin green or give her a more pointed chin.

They should have got Cierra Ramirez for the role or India Eisley though I don't think she has that much screen presence but since the film is about Maleficent I think it will do.

I'm really hoping Cinemasins will go over this movie once it's released. A few of the ""movie sins"" were just too obvious. I was kinda mad that Maleficent's character didn;t even turn full on evil after her wings were stolen. During the animated film when she sets her curse into motion, at the end she says that Aurora will prick her finger ""AND DIE!"" I was waiting for that epic part T^T But it didn't happen. Instead I get this ""dead sleep, true kiss"" nonsense. You know what else didn't happen? The 3rd fairy never gave Aurora her gift. Because her gift was that she wouldn't die. but only be asleep until true loves first kiss. This means that the fairies giving Aurora ""gifts"" were pointless. WTF?

2014-06-08T18:29:11,"Angelina Jolie's critics call her performance as Maleficent magnetic and magnificent, and rightly so as her fierce screen presence is a force of nature ... Her acting generally is brilliant, out of all the films she's appeared in, but the problem is, ever since her incredibly deserved Oscar win as a socio-path in ""Girl, Interrupted"", she has only managed flops or farces, films that are much below Angelina, who is more commended for her huge potential than what she's actually done (and even though she's managed quite a few Golden Globes, let's face it, it's because people want to give her awards because she's Angelina Jolie, but she did manage an Oscar nomination for Changeling in 2008, however, it was as yet another film that was below her and Jolie adds drama to anything she's in).  If only Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson wasn't off milking The Hobbit beyond its worth (though they are good films, but that's because he's Peter Jackson) and actually had directed Maleficent, and they had got a great script, then Angelina's dramatic performance wouldn't be outshining the failing film surrounding her, and it probably would have been Oscar material under his or Christopher Nolan or Alfonso Cauron's hands, and then started off this potential film trilogy to an outstanding start, something that would have lived up to the power and beauty of Ms. Jolie-Pitt.",1,0,Mark McKenzie,_pgmFAOgm5E,0.316017316017316,2014-06-08 18:29:11,False,True

2014-06-12T04:24:54,"I actually came up with a better story for it than the real one, using the previous draft of the movie. And I made it so that it is 99% faithful to the original story. In addition to that, as one would expect, it is a tragedy. Here it is for those who want to read (and I hope disney sees this, for all the good reasons)      Maleficent was once one of the most beautiful and powerful fairies within the enchanted fairy kingdom. Though her kind and loving mother died giving birth to her, the girl was loved by almost all who know her. Her best friend among the fairies was Flora, and they were inseparable. One day, she happened across a human trespasser named ""Stephan"", who was a prince in his own kingdom. Maleficent and Stephan soon fell in love with each other and began a secret relationship, for there is animosity between the human and the fairy worlds.  One day, Maleficent built Stephan a wonderful cottage and offered to let him stay for a while. He agreed, though what was to follow would change their fates. After the 3rd day, King Horatio, Stephan's father, gathered an army and stormed the fairy kingdom intending to retrieve his son and kill all of the fairies. Maleficent lead the fairies in the defensive battle using a good version of her famous dragon form. However, in a shocking twist, Stephan struck her in the back of the neck returning her to her original form. Then, making clear that he did not want to see anyone hurt, he agreed to give in to his father's wishes forever if he would live in harmony with the Fairies. Maleficent was against this, though not only did Stephan pressure her to do nothing, Horatio agreed to the terms. While it did assure in an era of peace and friendship, it was seen as a defeat to a majority of the fairies. Maleficent's aunt, who rules the lands and hates her niece for her sister's death, held the fair maiden accountable. Though Maleficent's father and Flora tried to stop her, the queen burned off her wings and welded 2 cow's horns on the back of her head before banishing her to die alone in the forbidden mountains. Within the mountains Maleficent met Diablo, a shape-shifting dark elf who preferred the form of a raven. After she told him as much as she was willing, he suggested she ""turns their back on them"" and get even with them. Following her new friend's advice, she united the mountain orcs, who faced oppression by the king, and declared war upon both kingdoms in the name of darkness. Years later, Horatio was killed in battle and Stephan ascended the throne. Not long after, Aurora was born. This infuriated Maleficent, not because of jealousy (her feelings for him died long before) but because having known the king for quite some time, she felt entitled to see the child. So she went into the castle in a calm rage and cursed the girl to die on her 16th birthday, not knowing that Flora and her companions have softened the curse to death-like sleep. 16 years pass and Maleficent is furious, even more so when she discovers that of all things her soldiers were searching for an infant this whole time. She therefore sends Diablo to search for the girl's domain, which he did by deducing the fairy's cottage. Then having laid an ambush that evening, the army of darkness mistakingly captured Prince Phillip instead. Believing him to be a spy, she sends her men to torture him at the castle while she seeks the princess herself. She is successful and tempts her to the fated room. While the witch intended to fulfill the curse, her interaction with Aurora met with quite an unexpected result. Because of the curse placed upon her, Aurora could feel Maleficent suffering all these years and felt sorry that she had to feel all of this pain. As such, she requested Maleficent fashion a spinning wheel and she fulfilled the curse out of her own will. While Maleficent was in deep thought, Stephan came to her castle alone both to convince her to lift the curse and to rekindle their old relationship, as he never stopped loving her even after all this time. When she softly refused both offers, he tells her that the curse was softened to be in deathly sleep, to be awakened by true love's kiss. With this new knowledge, she made plans for her and her minions to safely escort the prince to the palace tomorrow morning. She even went to the prison where he was being held revealed Briar Rose's identidy, eloquently promised that the 2 will be together forever. However, fearful that Flora may attempt something (what it is even she doesn't know), she had Diablo stand guard and ordered him to sound the alarm if something bad happened. While she retired in her quarters, she reflected on Aurora's pure heart and remembered everything good that has happened to her, even Stephan claiming he never stopped loving her. For the first time since she came to the mountains, she was truly happy. Her moment was broken when she heard Diablo's cawing suddenly stop. She emerged to find that Diablo has been turned to stone and all of her men have been slain. It took only a quick look to confirm that it was the doing of Prince Phillip and the 3 good fairies. Swearing vengeance upon them, she hurried to the tallest tower and attempted to kill them with lighting and thorns. When those failed, she whisked herself to the castle and faced the prince in her dragon form, now darkened by her years of suffering. Having cornered Phillip and being prepared to kill him, Flora made the hardest decision of her life; that for the curse to be lifted, Maleficent must die. So she and her comrades enchanted the sword and compelled to stab through her heart, killing her. Phillip then arrived at the tallest tower and awakened the Princess, and all lived happily ever after......well, almost everyone. the end.    what do you guys think?",0,0,Andrew Abbey,_pgmFAOgm5E,0.22075613275613268,2014-06-12 04:24:54,False,True

2014-06-29T05:46:46,"Contrary to the way many are so torn, I think the original ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Maleficent"" now work great together.  They both serve a purpose:  Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" (1959) sets a story as a fairy tale that is what people want and expect.  Something simple and black and white with no shades of gray or human complexity.  It also represents what type of propaganda the court would promote to preserve the legacy of the king and to save face.  Also, the original makes men look better (king and prince as a hero) and men were far more important and powerful than women in medieval times.  It is perfect for a first-time look.  However, ""Maleficent"" teaches us what can happen when all the events are pretty much there (famous christening scene, crow, dragon climax, crow, costume, spinning wheel, fairies, thorns, castle looks the same, Prince Philip, etc.) but a story is retold either purposely misleading to rewrite history to make one side look better or how a story is gradually altered as it is spread from person to person.  This movie is perfect for adults, once you've seen ""Sleeping Beauty"" as a kid.  It reminds us to always look for two sides to a story or what they AREN'T telling you, especially if it sounds to simplistic and all black and white.  Fairy becomes evil and curses an innocent baby due to a missed invitation?  That is what is unbelievable.  This is when you are old enough to know the truth and say, ""AH HA!  I knew there had to be more to the story than they were telling us or feeding to the public.  Now it all makes sense!""",0,0,SWLinPHX,_pgmFAOgm5E,0.17916666666666664,2014-06-29 05:46:46,False,True

Why did the first King even bother to attack? It was an absurd confrontation.  Why didn't Stefan murder Maleficent when he had the chance? It was painfully stupid and just as evil that he'd just cut off her wings.  Why did the three pixies change sides against Maleficent?  One of the pixies blessed Aurora with a wish to never become blue. It didn't work.  I could go on and on.  As I said, I suffered through the entire movie.

2014-10-22T14:28:26,"I personally did not like this film. There were some good parts in it, the cgi was good in some parts, Angelina Jolie's performance was great as Maleficent and I appreciate Disney offering a new perspective on the story of Sleeping Beauty. But my main gripe with this movie is that it tried to be too much like Frozen with a darker theme. Please hear me out before you lash out on me. Here are some similarities I just noticed while watching the movie: The misunderstood ""villain"" that's constantly referred to as a monster (Maleficent/Elsa). The younger optimistic adventurous girl that serves as the only source of happiness left in the ""villain's"" life (Aurora/Anna). The love interest that turns into a complete d-bag and betrays the protagonist (Stefan/Hans). The act of true love that didn't require a guy to break the curse. I was just disappointed that it tried to re-create the tropes that worked in Frozen. Before you say it didn't work in Frozen because I know how sensitive people are when it comes to that movie. I'm just gonna say that majority of the people who watched it loved it therefore it's safe to say that the tropes did work. Just like how the tropes in The Lion King didn't work out for me but I'm not gonna say that it didn't work because majority of the audience will disagree with me. I did not like the way how they treated the fairies, they were basically the three stooges but fairies. Philip was not needed in this movie and his only purpose is to be the eye candy for girls. Stefan was not threatening at all, I can't take him seriously with that high pitched voice, although in some parts he did good I will admit that. And the act of true love that I'm pretty sure EVERYONE saw coming. I mean, there were little kids sitting near me and my family in the theater saying that they knew that Maleficent was gonna break the curse because they already saw it in Frozen. I'm just disappointed, I wish this movie tried to come up with its own unique formula instead of trying to leech off of a more critically acclaimed and successful film.",4,11,noname144able,_pgmFAOgm5E,0.239597288676236,2014-10-22 14:28:26,False,False

2015-03-18T17:54:00,"For those of you who thinks that This movie is bad because Maleficent is ""supposed"" to be pure evil, are so narrow-minded. In real life, no one is born evil. There are reasons why people become cold, untrusting etc. It's like judging someone without knowing the reasons. I think this movie is an insight to why someone loses their trust and innocence. This is NOT a feminist movie either just because the protagonist is male. Stefan just happened to be the reason of Maleficent's transformation. And it's kinda dumb for Prince Philip to be the one kissing Aurora and being ""true love"". That defeats the purpose of remaking a fairy tale twist. They've only met once. It's creepy when someone just kisses you in your sleep. Then marries him off. Nothing to do with feminist shit.

It's not as dark or as grown up as it thinks it is, and that's what disappointed me the most about this film above many other things. Granted, some of the effects and action sequences were nice to look at, and Angelina Jolie especially was really good in the role. I just think she, as well as the rest of the cast, deserve a better script and a better direction. So much potential that was wasted for laughably bad character development, a piss poor rewrite of a story and a villain that was already fantastic, and an unfocused tone.
