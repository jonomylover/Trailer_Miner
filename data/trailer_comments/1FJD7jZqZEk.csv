Oddly enough, this is pretty much exactly what the movie itself has done, taking everything from Jurassic Park and amping it up to eleven. (...)

2018-04-18T16:10:30,"There is not much left from the origional Jurassic Park saga. It's filming style, atmosphere. This is just a bunch of movies (and much seen before movie tricks) put together. I've seen the same movie tricks in the last 'JP' movies  over and over. And it looks more like 'Aliens' or Godzilla, than a JP movie. They just use the Jurassic Park stuff to build a commercial new movieline. Tricks like a screaming, scared kid in front of a big dinosaur, those pathetic oneliners like 'run!'.. like a screaming T. rex.. like the running people.. like a big dinosaur who is behind people.. like just showing a bunch of claws on a dinosaur arm.. ow, ow. I'm dissapointed. And that smart 'Blue' animal.. come on. He doesn't even look or act like a Velociraptor. They raped Jurassic Park. I'm a big fan. But this just doesn't hit my feelings in a good way. It's just a (again) movie, made to get as much as can people from all ages and interests to the cinema. The storyline is pathetic. I agree with the fact that the original JP movie had a lot of stupid things in it also, but you can't compare the movies from JP3 to this one with the original JP movie style. The novel is such a different thing. This is just a standard 'action' hero movie. Or does it proof the Chaos Theory???... anyway..

2018-04-18T16:16:02,So this was all a plan they were provided by some other military people who helped them not to just save them but to sell them. Claire & Owen might not be aware that this was all a plan they want to sell every dinosaur Except blue because maybe they wanted her to fuse with some other dinosaur to make a new hybrid like indo raptor... But Owen jumps in .. he understands every thing. He reminds blue of her old days as shown in trailer baby blue.. After that I think that one who wants to sell dinosaurs gets a smell that they know about their plan and they are going to stop it. So they release the indoraptor in that manor to kill them so they cannot be the wall in their lane/path. I think its the last time we see blue because before he was about to shoot him with his gun blue was on her. But when be fires two times I think indo kills blue and at the end they kill the indo using rexy. That's my theory . might be wrong but I'm way too excited for it....,130,14,Bowie,1FJD7jZqZEk,0.013210227272727273,2018-04-18 16:16:02,True,True

If you're a true Jurassic Park/World fan, then you will know by now that they're going to use many animatronics in this movie. There are few behind the scenes footage that prove it! Just search for "" Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom - Go behind the scenes"" on youtube and you will see it!  * I've marked my calendar calendar when the first trailer came out.. I've marked my calendar when the second trailer came out... And i'm going to mark my calendar all over again after the third trailer!!!! That's how EXCITED i am!!!

I'm NOT going to let ANYONE ruin my joy or take away my happiness when it comes to Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom!!!.. And i'm going to watch it at least 3 times guaranteed!! :-)  * I've said it before and i will say it again... Universal Pictures, please take my money already! LOL!!  * Last.. But not least..

But about the CGI itself, I wouldn‚Äôt complain so much. Throughout two decades, our effects have improved a vast amount. I feel as if many of the watchers don‚Äôt typically realize how much time and effort goes into it all. It doesn‚Äôt put itself together at the snap of your fingers.   Once again; I‚Äôm very optimistic about this film and definitely plan on seeing it! Can‚Äôt wait.",8,0,ShinzillaOfficial,1FJD7jZqZEk,0.25130208333333337,2018-04-18 17:03:13,True,True

Blue survives getting shot, but I'm not sure if the scene of her strapped down and sick happens after she's shot (which means it's not that sad because she survives) or after the Indo Raptor scene when she's injured from the fight (which means she didn't die again, but we aren't sure yet). The scene with the Baryonyx and Clair in the sewer happens before the volcano explosion because we can see the Baryonyx being airlifted off the island with Clair and the kid watching (which means they survive that scene so again nothing suspenseful about it). I already made a comment about the Mosasaur and the I Rex skeleton which they also showed in the trailer. So many spoilers!!!

A couple of white dudes in high school told me that if I want a gf, I have to man up and outgrow childish things that are not fundamental in life because it is making me weird, nerdy, and quirky. Since I am talented in art, I love to do artwork on different prehistoric creatures from their native time period and post it on Instagram. But some of my friends unfollowed me and told me that those pictures did not make them feel like they can relate to my life anymore. So they unfollowed me. They also told me that I need to get a real hobbie in order to be successful in life. My aunt likes to make false accusations about me and gossips to her neighbors that I post my stupid artworks on social media because I‚Äôm stupid, I like to impress people, garner attention, get their approval, and that I have low self esteem. I can assure you that none of those stuff about me are true! I was really hurt by what my friends did to me because I considered them to be really good friends having known them since 1st grade.

2018-04-19T00:03:59,"Now see if this is going to be the final movie in the Jurassic Park series they have to have a scene that really means something. My suggestion. Rexy dies in a meaningful way. She‚Äôs been in the series in the first movie. She‚Äôs one of the most popular dinosaurs in the entire series. It‚Äôs arguable that when the T Rex was shown in the first movie, that‚Äôs when dinosaurs really got popular again and so Rexy could be argued to have been responsible for the love of dinosaurs. She has been so important to the series and it would be so great to see her die in a really meaningful way like taking down the big bad dino. Like imagine Owen, Claire and Blue are RIGHT THERE to getting off the island before it‚Äôs destroyed but whatever the big bad Dino is (whether its this like genetically modified blue or whatever or if it‚Äôs a baryonyx) stops them and a little fight can ensue and when it looks like they won‚Äôt make it, Rexy comes in and fights it off and lets them get to an evac chopper and it reaches up to bite someone‚Äôs foot or grab the helicopter and Rexy bites its neck and pins it down to the ground with her foot and lets out one last triumphant roar before she goes down with the island. Maybe since Ian Malcom will be in the movie, Dr Grant can be on the chopper too and when he sees Rexy die, he lets out a tear. I think it would be amazing to see Rexy‚Äôs end with the end of the series",0,0,Zestful Maple,1FJD7jZqZEk,0.15469812925170068,2018-04-19 00:03:59,True,True

There is no doubt that Jurassic World made an error in relying solely on CG Effects, and only ONE scene using an Animatronic (even though that was a great scene.)  But, Fallen Kingdom IS learning from it's predecessor's mistake, and using more Animatronic (which are augmented with CG.)  Regardless, One cannot judge a film by it's trailer alone.  Trailers are NOT the final film, they are WIP Footage (which some scenes that don't even make it to the final cut.)  Wait until you see the film, and THEN you can decide if it sucks.   And, for those concerned over a ""Jurassic World 19"" in the future:  Don't. After Jurassic World 3, Universal's film rights to Jurassic Park will expire, and the sixth film is intended to bookend what the '93 film began.

2018-04-19T15:30:55,"Guys... have you noticed how wicked and dire the world is becoming as of late?  Take a moment and consider the state of our world:   -The Middle East is at the tipping point.   -The world hates Israel.   -There is a growing demand for a one world economic, political, and religious system.   -There are wars and rumors of war (especially in regards to World War 3).   -Racism is some of the worst it's ever been.   -Hatred and madness is spilling over into riots in the streets.   -Perversion is running rampant.   -The weather is out of control.   -We're mutilating unborn children and mistakenly believing we have a ""right"" to do so.   -Education is in the toilet.   -Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are happening in more and more diverse places at a highly alarming rate.  ... You getting the picture? Something is deeply wrong with our world.  None of what you see going on in the world is normal or good. In fact, much of what you see happening around the globe coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says many of these things would occur before Christ returns. You can investigate it for yourself. The Bible says in the last days there will be: wars and rumors of war; a one world economic/governmental/religious system; Kingdoms against kingdoms and the seas and people raging; Violence and perversion on a grand scale; Earthquakes in diverse places, etc.  ... Sounds *exactly* like our world today, doesn't it? If that weren't enough to chew on, consider this: The Books of John and Acts combined total up to over 120+ historically verified facts. When you consider that, it gets a little difficult to write the Bible off as fairy tales when history and archaeology are on its side...  *Are you paying attention yet?* God is *screaming* at us! He warned us thousands of years in advance that all of what you are seeing would happen- and it is! It's all coming together to the letter! In fact, if you doubt the validity of Bible Prophecy, I encourage you to consider this: the Bible warns that in the last days that Damascus will become ""a ruinous heap."" It will become a no man's land inhabited by no one. Use that as a litmus test of sorts. Keep an eye on Damascus. If it never falls then feel free to throw out the Bible. But when Damascus does fall in the not too distant future... You'll see God is no liar. God also declares that the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus as your Savior. Good deeds won't get you there nor do good deeds erase a bad deed. If you murder somebody, that person is still dead even if you do nothing but good deeds after murdering them. You need a Savior who will forgive you of that murder because you can't save yourself.  Yet, many people will still discount God and His goodness even when shown evidence that the Bible is valid and coming true. A lot of people have difficulty believing in God because of all the evils in the world. However, this discounting of the only Person who can save you may be less of an inborn frustration or complaint and more of a hidden longing, placed there by the very One who planted His own image into the body and soul of every person He created. Where does this deep-seated intuition that suffering and pain are not right come from if we're just amalgamations of atoms, as the atheists say‚Ä¶?  What if, perhaps, this intuition points to something deeper? Something built into ourselves that reflects our true nature and identity? What if this revulsion against suffering and pain is a reminder of paradise, on one hand, and an anticipation of New Jerusalem on the other?  Perhaps it's the cry of the human spirit for God. For our Creator. The only One who can, and will, fix this mess.  As I've said, time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, ""You're just being paranoid like all the other fundamentalists. Haven't we always had these types of problems?"" Sure... But never at this magnitude or frequency! Check the news for yourselves. The amount of earthquakes, bloodshed, madness and horrific weather events are off the charts! Don't be deceived into thinking it's not as bad as it seems out there. The devil wants you to stay anemic and apathetic. Don't let that jerk deceive you. Or win your soul. Satan wants nothing more than for you to roll your eyes, scoff under your breath and put this whole ""God"" business under the rug. He wants you to continue believing that Hell and God and the afterlife is nonsense. That the Bible is all fairy tale nonsense of Jesus riding dinosaurs; that it's stuff only the weak-minded, brainwashed people believe. He'll gladly coax your pride, making you believe you're far too ""reasoned"" to believe in such things. However, Satan believes the Bible. Every jot and word of it. He doesn't see it as fairy-tale nonsense since it details his coming destruction. He just doesn't want YOU to believe it so he can drag your soul down with him when it's time for him to go!  Don't let him drag you down into the grave with him. Don't be played! Hell is a very real place-- a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. A-L-O-N-E. In the dark. Miserable for all eternity. If hell wasn't real, what on earth was Jesus willing to die for to protect us from...? Bill Nye thinks hell won't be so bad; he claims he's willing to hold onto his darwinian beliefs even if it means he's hellbound for it. I hope you won't share in that kind of disillusioned thinking...  Before you're sent to hell, you'll appear at the Great White Throne Judgment. Whether you believe in hell or not makes no difference--that giant throne you want to avoid seeing at all costs will be your destiny if Christ isn't your Savior. At the Great White Throne Judgment the books are thrown wide open and the past is recalled. Details and sins long forgotten or covered up are brought to light. Plenty of people will have a list of good deeds: acts of charity, love, and sacrifice. All their good deeds will be carefully considered... but none of them will be good enough to gain them admittance into heaven. The good deeds they did will have an impact on where they end up in the lake of fire, however. Hell will not be the same for everyone, but it will still be eternal misery... misery you could have easily avoided.  Sinners will wish they had done just a little less evil so their punishment could be a little more tolerable. Pornographers will wish they hadn't made so many videos. Control freaks will wish they hadn't been so angry and abusive. The internet troll will wish he hadn't cursed and slung so many demeaning insults toward a stranger online. And the abortionist will wish they hadn't killed any pre-born infants. All sins will be exposed. There's no way out... unless...  Unless you accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you're a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His free gift of salvation and grace. It's all yours... free for the taking! Jesus is the only way to get out of what's coming soon upon this world. I know you've probably heard ""Jesus loves you"" a million times in your life, and it probably sounds like an empty mantra by now... but it really is the truth! Do you know why you exist? Have you ever stopped and pondered about that...? Nothing in this life comes to be without God's approval first. That means that God thought¬† you were so worth the effort that He created you!  Or maybe you're wondering, ""How do I know that only Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or what about Hinduism or Buddhism? How do I know that the Bible isn't a book of fiction and myths? In fact, what about all the starving kids in Africa? If God is so ""just and loving,"" explain that one!"" These are incredibly valid questions that deserve real answers. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with?  If you have deep questions related to God, or if you're just remotely curious about Him... I encourage you to search out these authors. I'll even list some of their books that address just about any issue or question you could have about God:  Frank Turek- ""Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case""  Andreas Kostenberger- ""Truth Matters""  Louis Markos- ""Apologetics for the 21st Century""  Norman L. Geisler- ""When Skeptics Ask,"" ""I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist""  C.S. Lewis- ""Mere Christianity""  Lee Strobel- ""The Case For Christ,"" ""The Case For A Creator,"" ""The Case For Grace""  Ravi Zacharias- ""The End of Reason,"" ""Jesus Among Other Gods,"" ""Can Man Live Without God?"" ""Why Suffering?""  Philip Yancey- ""Reaching For The Invisible God,"" ""Disappointment With God""  Also, the ""One Minute Apologist"" right here on YouTube offers quick videos that tackle tough questions about God.  **  Why am I telling you all this? Especially when this has absolutely nothing to do with the video you're watching? Simple: to warn you. To offer you a life line. Deep down, if you have discernment and common sense, you can tell something is dreadfully wrong with this world and something in your heart is telling you to get right with God before it's too late. Don't ignore that voice! Listen to it, no matter how small it is. I'm just a beggar telling other beggars where they can go to find the Bread of Life.  Don't let anything stop you from finding God. To quote Erwin Lutzer: ""Standing at the Great White Throne Judgment will be hordes from every country of the world, from every religion in the world, with the best intentions in the world. They will learn too late that God is serious about justice, and if Christ does not bear their punishment, they must bear their own.""  Don't lose your life! Let Christ save you while there's still time.",0,0,OtterloopB,1FJD7jZqZEk,0.08249744769119773,2018-04-19 15:30:55,True,True

Now 35, I see this film and it looks less realistic than a film made decades ago. Also the narrative is unoriginal and seems to have had more focus on the mighty dollar than it did on sparking the imagination of the youth of today. Spielberg succeeded where Lucus didn‚Äôt. Although Spielberg was on the cusp of the digital age he still used practical special effects and puppetry. This is a method that Christopher Nolan uses to this day. It does not matter how good digital special effects become, our brains still now it‚Äôs a big bucket of fakeness. Performance is all based around reaction... acting is reacting or something similar. I want to like this film with all of my heart, but I fear I will be fooling myself. I, like millions of others will still go see this film for that hunt for a tiny bit of nostalgia or hope that it‚Äôs like Spielberg‚Äôs masterpiece. I am not here to slate it before seeing it.

2018-04-20T01:05:17,"When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ‚Äî That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ‚Äî That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. ‚Äî Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. ‚Äî And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.",0,0,John Johnson,1FJD7jZqZEk,0.13422166469893748,2018-04-20 01:05:17,True,True

Law (Abraham's wish list & modernly spelled Allah, because Abraham was God as Abraham, meaning Goodness as God as Abraham, since we're all comprised of 100% Goodness, & Goodness as God as Abraham wanted more than the law permitted; the phallused wanted rape to be legalized, hence The Pentateuch and Jesus ""give everything to the rapists"" Christ is their Pied Piper of Mayhem, Magic, & Mysticism promoting their rape culture to infect more non-phallused women with their coagulated brain vomit & impregnate them & get as many phallused kids from them as they could to keep patriarchy going strong, rather than promoting math & literacy) meaning patriarchy was implemented as martial law & here we are with patriarchs protecting their rape scheme with their very own police force.

If a tyrannosaurus rex got hit by automatic weapons fire of even .223, it might still kill you, but it is going to bleed out and die without medical attention.  The lack of .50 BMG's in Jurassic Park films ruins suspension of disbelief for audiences with access to the internet and any manner of uncensored battlefield video you can imagine in a world with GoPro HERO cameras that's been at constant war for decades....and that's not even accounting for the hunters, veterans, medical professionals and others who know very well how soft flesh responds to ballistic impacts.  And on top of that...why doesn't anyone ever beat up a raptor with a machete?  I mean...humans have sadly had entire nations lost to that simple device...I don't think raptors stand a chance against a physically fit human....and yes, I'm still salty about the professional hunter from the first film going down like a sack of potatoes.

2018-04-27T01:30:00,"This is my theory about the movie.   It opens with a man talking to doctor wu. ""We need something like the indominous rex, but smaller, faster and much more scary. What do you need to create something like this?"" The man asks wu. ""What would it be used for?"" Asks wu. ""We thinking of military application, but I guess it's whatever the highest bidder wants to do with it"". Answers the man. ""Do you want it to follow orders?"" Asks wu. ""That would be great."" Replies the man. ""What do you need?"" He asks. ""I need a piece of the indominous rex and blue."" Replies wu. ""How do we find either of those?"" Asks the man. ""The indominous rex was killed by the mosasaurs. So the indominous rex's carouse would be at the bottom of the moasosaur lagoon."" Answers wu. ""You're going to need a small submarine that can navigate through the rivers and tunnels that connect the lagoon to the ocean. Your also going to need a team to head to the control centre and open the gate that seperates the lagoon from the ocean."" He continues. ""What about the moasosaur?"" Asks the man. ""It would be long dead from starvation replies wu"".   The movie then cuts to an aircraft carrier as a helicopter takes of from it and heads to nublar and a submarine is lowered into the water. The helicopter lands on mainstreet and a man wearing a yellow jacket hops out and walks to the innovation centre. Once he reaches the innovation center he takes an elivator up to the control centre.   By this time the submarine has reached the gate. The man in the yellow jacket flicks a switch and the gates open. The submarine cruises through into the lagoon and scans the bottom. Eventually they find what they are looking for. The indominous rexs skeleton. The submarine uses a saw to cut of one of the indominous rexes ribs and a arm to grab to detached rib. Then they notice a giant shape next to the sub. It's eyes open.   By this time the guy in the yellow jacket is halfway to the helicopter. He hears a thud and looks down at a puddle. The puddle ripples. Another thud and puddle ripples again. Another thud and the same thing happens. More thuds occur, each one after another like foot steps. Giant footsteps. The man in the yellow jacket turns around to see a trex walking towards him. He starts running towards the helicopter however unfortunately the helicopter had also noticed the trex and were taking of and hovering 10 metres above the ground out of the trexes reach.  The moasosaur races out of the gate and into the ocean hitting the sub with its tail. The helicopter deploies a ladder and the guy with the yellow jacket clings on for dear life. The helicopter races of. The trex's jaws barely mis the the man. The man sighs believing he is out of danger. Then the moasosaur leaps out of the the water snatching the guy in the yellow jacket up.   A man hands the indominous rexes rib over to doctor wu. Doctor wu examins the rib. He begins to smile. ""One more thing, i need blue"". He asks. ""How are we going to find her?"" Asks the man. ""Clair runs the dinosaur protection group so she will be easy to find. She and owen had a rather close bond. So find clair, She can lead us to owen, and owen can lead us to blue.",47,22,AllThingsWildlifeYT,1FJD7jZqZEk,0.03507936507936508,2018-04-27 01:30:00,True,True

So it looks like they've done just that and made Indominus Rex into Indominus Raptor. That would explain why they might need Blue, and why we see the sub down where there appears to be the remains of the Indominus after being devoured - perhaps to collect genetic data?  I was a little iffy when I saw the first official trailer, but this one has me a bit more hooked.

Why do they need to go get bones from the I-Rex when Wu made off with a ton of DNA at the end of the first one? Where does Rexy go when she's released? What about the other dinosaurs? And that's just a few! Also I'm so down for watching more arrogant, slimey corporate assholes getting recked by something they thought they could control.   P.S.

2018-06-09T21:55:34,"In my own humble opinion, this franchise has ran its course.  Each sequel has a glaring resemblance to the previous installment.  While the original was replete with amazing special effects and fine acting, the new installments albeit retaining great special effects seems to have deteriorated where actors are concerned. The new cast except for Jeff Goldblum seems to be wooden and the ""acting"" contrived. Hollywood could remake such classics as ""The Valley Of Gwangi"", ""The Crater Lake Monster"", ""Planet Of The Dinosaurs"", ""The Lost World "", ""Journey To The Beginning Of Time"" and ""The Beast Of Hollow Mountain""",0,0,Eric Phantom,1FJD7jZqZEk,0.1654125286478228,2018-06-09 21:55:34,True,True

And I couldn't care less about people but the brachio's horrible death on the edge of the island???posing as she did in 1993 when we first saw her?? Really?? I know it was meaningful. It establishes what actually fallen kingdom means. But still, It was heartbreaking.still processing this new Jurassic. Worth going to the cinema to watch it but believe me as a second part of a triology, the 1997 second Jurassic is waaaay more epic. This one is nice to see with the special effect and all that but gives me a feeling of desperate attempt to sell and the mayority of the movie taste Mainstream.

I wasn't impressed nor was I let downed. It's not much that they can keep doing with this franchise and I take it for what its worth. It's a good sequel to the first Jurassic World and even has callbacks to the first Jurassic Park. The last half of the movie did have a horror vibe to it involving the Indoraptor, my only gripe about the recent movies is that they are trying to make the dinosaurs heroes of the movie.

Since this is my first time seen any movie from this franchise, I did not have any preconceived notion so I wouldn't be able to compare this movie with the others. But from the little glimpse I've seen from the original movie, it seems that they are taking a different route with this franchise. If you are strapped for cash and you don't know if it's worth seen or not, I say save your money for another movie; but if you just want to go see it without taking a hit to your pocket, it will be an okay movie. You are not going to get anything deep from the story-line other than the exterior. Overall, this movie was mediocre, but the way they set it up for the next movie really has me excited to see the next movie. The next one looks to be epic if done right, but if I had to judge this movie in itself, it would not make me want to see the next one if it were not for how they set it up for the next film.

It's supposed to be a hybrid of the Indominus and a Velociraptor,  but the Indominus is already a hybrid using Velociraptor DNA. Taking that and further hybridizing it with more Velociraptor is pointless..  I'm really starting to wonder when these Hollywood writer idiots are going to actually put forth some sort of effort at keeping things coherent and making sure their plot-lines and story points actually follow from A to B when making sequels. Certainly there have always been issues that crop up with continuity and whatnot, but as time moves on and more movie sequels are produced, I'm forced to question whether or not the writers of a new film in a series actually saw/read about/know anything about the previous installments.  For instance; the most recent Pirates of the Caribbean blatantly contradicts established and well-defined events set up in previous films. And the Transformers series...1/2/3 tried to follow one another, but after that each new one takes the meaning of retcon to a whole new (and more ridiculous) level. Randomly resurrecting previously dead Transformers, randomly giving backstory that is in extreme contradiction with previous backstory, borrowing heavily from ""Herbie"" cause why the hell not right?",0,0,Taranizs,1FJD7jZqZEk,-0.01649418290043289,2018-07-11 01:36:53,False,True

The only one that could be a bitch to take down is the Mosasaurus.  So I kinda hope the next movie is about  ''the gang'' trying to capture the dino's before they get killed and ship them to the sanctuary that Lockwood wanted them to go in the first place.   Sidenote: while this latest movies is good. The main concept is reminds me of The Lost World, where Malcolm and that lady (forgot her name) came to study the dino's and Ingen came to catch them and earn money with.

2018-08-21T14:32:08,I just thought the movie was just too much like the previous one. I guess the only thing that made it different was now the dinosaurs run free on the mainland. It was kind of obvious that they were now going to try and exist with these dinosaurs. I was not big on the new raptor. It felt to rushed. You were just learning about this new raptor and it was already Time to kill it. The movie had its moments but it just felt too rushed.It started too quick and then all the sudden was changing gears and I just felt like it was just about showing new and old dinosaurs and not much of a plot. No new one. It reminded me of the lost world. Raptors just are not scary in the new ones which I am not a fan of. They were wild frightening creatures in the original 3. It just feels like yes there are more creatures but it also seems to be missing something. I don't know. I remember how scary the T-Rex was in the original and she has never been as scary since.

2018-09-12T17:05:52,I'm sorry  but the movie sucked. I will explain why. Jurassic world is not gory enough. The dinosaurs are suppose to be more savage and brutal than that. I hate movies where dinosaurs are friendly to people. The old school Jurassic Park movies were more horror and more fun to watch because they appeared to be thrilling enough to put you on the edge. The problem with jurassic world movies is that you have this guy (lead actor) who happens to be some kind of superheroish dude whom certain dinosaurs dont harm but then the dinosaurs attack only the bad guys in most cases and eats them. Its kinda the same boring story over and over again. Good guy lives or superhero guy survives while bad guys die.....mmmm same bullshit. The movie would have been more fun if all the characters (both bad and good)  were very helpless in the movie. Story would have been more exciting and thrilling if the dinosaurs killed even some of the innocent guys by surprise.....the movie is suppose to make you scared. Dinosaurs are not supposed to be friendly to humans and projecting them as baby dinosaurs that want to be cuddled by humans is just a bad idea.,0,3,Stealthmann,1FJD7jZqZEk,0.0639795918367347,2018-09-12 17:05:52,False,True

The same usual sh!t you see in movies (sorry for my language).
