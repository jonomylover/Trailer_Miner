2014-07-31T20:23:38,"There's a huge difference between The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner. People only seem to link the two together because it's a bunch of teenagers all in one sectioned-off space being watched by people who put them there in the first place. But, the similarities end right about there. The Maze Runner and The Hunger Games are two completely different and unique YA novels with very different stories to them.¬† Firstly, The Maze Runner was written before The Hunger Games (James first started writing The Maze Runner back in something like 2005 if I can recall correctly). The Maze Runner is based around Thomas (who is a male protagonist as opposed to Katniss who is a female protagonist) who wakes up in a maze and can't remember anything but his first name. There are also only boys in the Glade (the safe part of the Maze) and, like Thomas, none of them can remember anything but their first names. They know from various little clues around the Maze that they're being watched by 'WICKED' and that they get sent food and supplies from the Creators regularly. And then of course Teresa comes in the Box and things in and around the Glade start falling apart. The Maze Runner doesn't have a love story within it, and also the Gladers aren't fighting each other to the death. In fact, they do the polar opposite, they group together and try to get out of the Maze together. It's also a post-apocalyptic story as opposed to dystopian, which is the genre that The Hunger Games falls into. Also, in the second book there are cranks (people who have been infected with a disease called the Flare and are basically violent and insane.)¬† The Maze Runner is also more of a tense thriller and action novel, whereas The Hunger Games is more of an adventure novel with a smattering of romance and action. If you've read both The Maze Runner and The Hunger Games, it's probably already obvious to you that The Maze Runner is a lot more gritty and in some ways 'darker', so to say, than The Hunger Games. There are countless more differences between The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner but I think I've written enough already.¬† So please, before you comment saying that 'This looks just like The Hunger Games' or, 'This is an obvious rip-off of The Hunger Games.', please read the two series' first. Otherwise, I can guarantee that you'll feel the wrath of pissed off Gladers who are tired of hearing the comparison hundreds upon thousands of times.¬† I hope this helped clear up any confusion, and just for the record, I am a very big fan of both books. And if you do decide to read The Maze Runner, I hope you enjoy it :)",0,0,Roisin S,AwwbhhjQ9Xk,0.07625661375661377,2014-07-31 20:23:38,True,True

It stays true to what you read in the book. And that it gives you more detail for what you'd see in the movie! Not only that, but (in my opinion) It's even more epic looking. I can not wait to see it. I'm now finishing The Kill Order after I read the first book. Even though the Kill Order book is really sad and tiring, I still enjoyed it more so far. It's a bit more epic with a hint of horror. And are the first two books to make me sad, happy, scared, and more!

2014-08-24T06:10:54,FYI if you're a hunger games fan Fuckoff your book is trash and nothing like this masterpiece series. Besides some pretty huge plots for the first book dealing with Teresa first coming AWAKE and it looks like some things were a bit off... But anyway the cast looks as great as the effects if you haven't read the series this will be nothing you've seen before it's fantastic I won't spoil why the actual ending of the entire series made me sad. Others will maybe know ANYWAY it only gets better but at the same time there's a lot of sorrow and loss in these books which may not be even looked at in the trailer considering what happens near the end of this book. Odds are if you're an emotional movie watcher and you enjoy this you will eventually shed a tear I think this could be a big hit if they do it right and that means make the book readers happy.

I know they had to shorten it up to keep it in the 2 hour range but it felt really rushed and was lacking a lot of character development. They also changed so much and in doing so, a few scenes didn't even make sense. *SPOILER* For example, the scene with Thomas running into the maze trying to help Minho get inside didn't make sense because he obviously knew there was no way he would be able to get back inside because he was almost crushed getting out. Also they didn't really even bother explaining the changing process (which played a big role in the book). Teresa's character also seemed so pointless in the movie. She literally contributed nothing to the plot. It also kind of annoyed me that they didn't even mention that they don't even know their real names. In the book the scientists renamed them after historic geniuses such as Isaac Newton and Thomas Edison. Overall, i was very disappointed. I don't know why they didn't just sticks to the story.

2014-09-28T02:53:24,"I got to be honest  but this movie really disappointed me. They changed a lot of things. There were parts in the movie that James Dashner didn't include in the book. And there were very important parts in the book that wasn't shown in the movie. For example: in the book, when the doors didnt close and the Grievers came the gladers were preparing until the grievers come and then they all slept in the Homestead. But in the movie the Grievers came so quick they didn't have time to prepare anything so instead they decided to run away from the grievers. Talking about Grievers, in the book they described them as slugs. But in the movie they look like spiders or scorpions. And another really big thing they missed was the code words. You know, the six very important words that was probably one of the reasons they actually got out of the maze. And at the end of the movie, they didnt ride a helicopter, they rode a bus. (But I gotta admit it was pretty cool when they got off the ground and into the air and they saw the glade and the maze. kinda shocking). The last thing is one of the reasons I wanted to see the movie in the first place but in the book Thomas and Teresa could telepathically talk. There was also kind of a love triangle between them. I was very sad when I realized that didn't happen. But there was also alot of positives in the movie. I loved how they showed the brotherhood between Thomas and Chuck. And how they made Newt so handsome. Sorry, fangirl-ing right now.(SQEEEEE!!) anyways , overall I give this movie a 6 stars out of 10.

Obviously I don't know if I've written any letters before the Maze, but even if it's not my first, it's likely to be my last . I want you to know that I'm not scared . Well, not of dying anyway. It's more forgetting . It's losing myself to this virus, that's what scares me . So every night I've been saying their names out loud . Alby .  Winston . Chuck . And I just repeat them over and over  like a prayer , and it all comes flooding back. Just the little things that like where the sun used to hit the Glade at the perfect moment right before it slipped beneath the walls. And I remember the taste of Frypan's stew - I never thought I'd missed that stuff so much. I remember you, I remember the first time you came up in the Box, just a scared little Greenie who couldn't even remember his own name. From the moment you ran into the Maze I knew I would follow you anywhere . And I have . We all have . If I could do it all over again , I would . And I wouldn't change a thing . And my hope for you is that when you're looking back years from now you'll be able to say the same . The future is in your hands now Tommy , and I know you'll find a way to do what's right. You always have. Take care of everyone for me . And take care of yourself . You deserve to be happy . Thank you for being my friend .
