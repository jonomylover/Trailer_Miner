Both trailers have teased with Theron's character asking, ""What's your name?"" to which we don't hear the obvious reply. I think that Hardy's character is someone searching for the original Max, following him along Fury Road in the desert for reasons to be revealed in the movie. This would allow the original series to be acknowledged while allowing for a new trilogy with a new character. We may find out eventually that the original Max is dead, or we may get no answer in this movie allowing for the possibility of an appearance by Gibson as Max in a future installment.

2014-12-12T15:37:29,"SO... first impressions.  The arrangement of the trailer (clip arrangement, score, graphics, etc.) made it look/sound more like a comedic grindhouse or comedic B movie. Although the franchise had funny moments, especially when the bad guys got ""owned"" by Max in ingenious ways, the movie was fairly serious.  From the trailer, it seems that ""Mad Max"" is just a supporting character, even though the movie is named after him. It seems that the roving gang and Charlize had more ""face time"" in that trailer than Max. It also didn't show much of Max ""kicking ass""  - in short, there's too little ""Mad Max"" in the Mad Max trailer.  They also seem to be fleshing out the roving gang more, which they shouldn't really do too much of. They are generic and irrelevant characters - their sole purpose (as in many similar movies) is to be ""owned"" by the protagonists. Putting them in there longer than they should, and possibly imbuing them with humanity (by making them more than the kill counts they're supposed to be), and it takes away from the protagonists.  2:13 I also have an issue with Max's costume. It is similar from his iconic costume, but different enough that it doesn't even look remotely close to what Max wore in the 1st and in the 2nd movie - the movie is supposed to take place in between the 1st and the 2nd movie. The costume that he should've worn in this movie should be a ""composite"" of the costumes worn in both movies, or something very close to it. The costume matters a lot - you can change the actor, but part of moviegoers identifying the actor as the character he's supposed to portray is the costume - the other parts are the looks and the body type (which I think they did okay). The leather jacket needed to be blacker (not brand new, just blacker), the hard shoulderpads were replaced by something that looks like pads that you put underneath a jacket to have broader shoulders. They should've taken more inspiration from the older films for the costume. If they want a mix of the original look with a few tweaks, they could check Kenshiro's costume in Hokuto no Ken/Fist of the North Star - the Japanese anime was inspired by the franchise.  Also, did they have to have Max wear a mask just to pull in the Bane fans? Hardy probably wasn't too happy with that (he wouldn't say it, of course) - I know if I was him, I want to be known as someone who could do roles other than Bane.  From the first impressions... not sure if I want to spend money to watch it - it's too late for any changes, so what was seen here would most likely be seen in the movie when it comes out. It is also unfortunate that Mel Gibson didn't reprise his role as Max.  But I've been waiting for a follow-up to this franchise for a very long time, so I suppose I will watch it out of curiosity, and not because I'm excited from what I've seen from the trailer.  Hopefully, it doesn't disappoint.  2c.",0,0,tgpgrimreaper,YWNWi-ZWL3c,0.05962558275058276,2014-12-12 15:37:29,True,True

But most of all, I remember the Road Warrior  the man we called Max. To understand who he was, you have to go back to another time  when the world was powered by the black fuel  and the deserts sprouted great cities of pipe and steel. Gone now swept away. For reasons long forgotten, two mighty warrior tribes went to war  and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all.  Without fuel they were nothing. They'd built a house of straw. The thundering machines sputtered and stopped. Their leaders talked and talked  and talked  but nothing could stem the avalanche. Their world crumbled  the cities exploded. A whirlwind of looting  a firestorm of fear.  Men began to feed on men.  On the roads it was a white-line nightmare. Only those mobile enough to scavenge  brutal enough to pillage would survive. The gangs took over the highways  ready to wage war for a tank of juice. And in this maelstrom of decay  ordinary men were battered and smashed.  Men like Max  the warrior Max. In the roar of an engine, he lost everything  and became a shell of a man  a burnt out, desolate man  a man haunted by the demons of his past.  A man who wandered out into the wasteland. And it was here in this blighted place  that he learned to live again."" Mad Max 2: Intro",1,0,Goggles Bob,YWNWi-ZWL3c,-0.023768939393939405,2014-12-13 02:20:41,True,True

Proves the only way to completely decimate an original Australian classic is to remake it into something completely further than farfetched even for an apocalyptic story and throw in extremely high paid US and UK actors from the Hollywood precinct (ho hum) for bums on seats.  Boring!!!!! The reason Mad Max was such a popular film was because it was CULT CLASSIC. Not a box office blockbuster.  You ask any Mad Max fan and they will always tell you number one was the best!! Why ? Because the lines in the script were originally geared toward the Australian lingo e.g. ""Better call a meat truck, Tommy's copped a saucer in the throat"" and because a large percentage of actors in the film were NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Arts) graduates, the pinnacle of dramatic arts excellence in Australia.  What on earth was George Miller smoking when he agreed to the cast  and the script of Fury Road?  Give another up and coming Aussie in like Todd Lasance a go.  He would have been perfect to play Max.  Instead they use a British actor, I'm appalled",0,6,alibi,YWNWi-ZWL3c,0.04337301587301586,2014-12-20 06:09:51,True,True

Things you need: shovel, bucket, rock, a long straw, tape, clear plastic wrap  step 1: dig a hole you can cover completely with the plastic step 2: dig a hole in the hole and place in your bucket, pack in the gaps with sand step 3: tape straw to inside of bucket with other end laying over the edge of hole  step 4: cover over hole with plastic wrap. place rock on wrap, directly over bucket  step 5: wait patiently for evaporation process to take place (one hour at least)  Water constantly evaporates from the earth, it collects in to the sky to form clouds and then rain over the earth. Evaporated mist will become trapped by the plastic and writhe down in the form of moisture to the lowest point where the rock weighs on top. Once enough has collected, it will form droplets of water and drip into your bucket. Over time you will have a full bucket of water. Take a sip from that straw sticking out of your man-mad water catcher. Repeat this process over the entire earth for as far as you can. Teach it to everyone you meet.

The same thing with the cars: why are they so clean, and without a single dent? It's not like there would be many body shops and car washes in a post-apocalyptic world!

2015-02-18T00:26:28,"Mad Max essentially ended when Byron Kennedy (co-director) passed away in 1983. Beyond Thunderdome, directed without him, is sentimental and laboured in comparison to the gritty realism of the first two films, which are Australian masterpieces - especially the second film. Based on the YouTube previews I have seen, this new George Miller film looks appalling, and utterly unrealistic. I will see it in its entirety, but to me it looks more like a computer game than a movie. All subtlety and nuance are gone, replaced with overblown stunts, special effects and, this last one confounds me, supermodels. Hearing characters with American accents provokes a reaction in me bordering on outrage - isn't the Mad Max world set in AUSTRALIA, with its unique landscape and dialect!!! Imagine how an American audience would react to an Australian sequel or prequel of True Grit, Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane, yet we are supposed to accept this insult to classic Australian cinema. While the ignorant teenage boys who go to see this film will probably love it, with its explosions and hot chicks, I think it will quickly be consigned to an already enormous catalogue of forgettable Hollywood blockbusters, while Mad Max 1 and 2 will continue on in people's minds as revered cult classics.",0,0,Simeon Walker,YWNWi-ZWL3c,-0.009969054383116889,2015-02-18 00:26:28,True,True

Even despite the noticeably awful dubbing, I found it visceral, totally engaging and and especially clever in its vision of an alternate society.  When Road Warrior came along I was flabbergasted by the extent to which Miller had taken the concept. And Thunderdome in turn left me equally stunned.  Miller created a series of intelligent action/adventure movies. Does not matter how many so-called cliche car chases, crashes and fisticuffs there are in them. It's how it's all woven into a believable and utterly unique representation of the future.  Verisimilitude is not at all too high-falutin' a term for what the man delivers on screen. And from the trailer, it certainly looks as if he'll once again succeed. I used to be quite the cinema lover and goer, but frankly I think movie making in general has been on a seemingly long deathwatch.  I look forward to again getting out and plunking dollars down to experience some quality movie-making.

2015-04-22T21:49:34,"This film might do well in IMAX form, given its visual nature. But as a movie, I have no desire to see it.  Whereas the original two were quite good, and I saw the third as well (too depressing to watch again).  Mad Max, and The Road Warrior both worked because of what Mel Gibson brought to that role - a ""CHristian sensibility"" :  namely, a guy who loses his family, and then decides to ignore ""the law"" (ordinances of man) in his quest for peace, justice, ... righteousness.  Society calls him ""Mad""... for he has rejected society in this ""lawless time"".  So, he was interesting to watch, this moral person, who is an outlaw, a criminal even, now - with no checks and balances, other than his own conscience, and a voice, he may, or may not hear. .... In contrast, this movie... looks pointless... who do you root for here? Could have been a great vehicle for Katherine Heigl though. I mean, all you have are ""mad characters"" here, and none of them seem ""Christian"". ..... But the original two movies, seemed to ask a basic question - What came first?  Houses, or government?  Does society establish law and order, or does law and order establish society?  Mad Max. Uncivilized?  Last hope of civilization?  Deep thinker?  He's mad.  Angry too.",0,0,iRena,YWNWi-ZWL3c,-0.07453703703703704,2015-04-22 21:49:34,True,True

George Miller the original director returns as the father of post-apocalyptic cinema. The textures and the colours of the movie maintain the atmosphere of the old ones. The action is smart and fast. You will be on the edge of your seat all the time. The designs of the cars are original as fuck. The concept artists and the VFX artists did a great job, an amazing one. The writting is very good. You wouldnt expect such an original screenplay and dialogue from a blockbuster but thats thanks to George Miller and his writters team. The stunts are amazing they did a hell of a job with the camera movements. The characters have each one their own arch. The acting is specific to this kind of world.

2015-05-18T14:50:29,"I think the current movie-going public have forgotten how important characters and basic screenwriting is to movie making. I'm not referring to making money or hitching up an old franchise to modern stunts effects. I'm talking about building characters and story that give a movie texture, spirit and lasting value. From the opening scene Max goes awry, a bad driver who's impotent and caught in less the 60 seconds and turned into a blood bank for MUCH of the 1st act. He's given little to say, but when he does speak the dialogue is amateurish and even embarrassing. But don't let that bother you as Max is barely a supporting character. He's not the driving force of the story and not even aware of ANY goal until the midpoint and even then he shows only passing interest. This retooled Max may be the worst written character in all of cinema and this shallow rendering will make you miss Gibson's Max and shed bitter tears. And yet this movie is called Mad MAX. Good grief.  Well, a movie is as good as the villain right? Sorry, but this villain is shown as weak and sick from the start. Expecting a showdown with Max? Forget it. Max has zero connection to the villains anyway.  The other incredibly bad element is in fact the ACTION! Good lord; how can I say that? The stunts are amazing, perfect and violent. But the issue here is that they are pretty much the same all the way through and the intensity doesn't have far to go. In fact, one of the best chase scenes comes early and that leaves Max with little else to tread upon. Mad Max IS a roller coaster ride, but it's all one giant downhill run without turns or dips. Without real dramatic conflict the stunts become about as pointless as a fireworks display. Not having a clear main character is not a small flaw. It leaves the movie sucked out and dry, heartless and dull. While the movie has beats, it has NO solid structure. NONE. It simply repeats sequences without any escalation or change of venue. Regardless of shifting goals, the challenge always remains the same; to fight off bad guys in cars. This can work in a boxing movie, but you don't want to watch 121 minutes of Rocky throwing the same left hook. Believe me, I'm barely scratching the surface of how bad Max is as it's replete with awful writing and uninventive story-telling. The ONLY performance that matters in Max is that of Nicholas Hoult. He's the only character that is not treated like a prop and is given an arc. Beyond that most of the lines are read as if for the first time, stilted and awkward.  Some of this might be digestible if not for the shear IDIOCY of this movie. Furiousa speaks of her best chance to make it home, but steals ""breeding women"" to kill her chances. A bad guy turns good for no reason other than the touch of a hot redhead. Watch for the curing of a collapsed lung and the instant blood transfusion that follows. Let's pretend we're all morons so we can enjoy tires flying through the air. And it's not like it wouldn't take 4-8 minutes to write better scenes, but why bother?  Mad Max joins the Transformers franchise in the ""Screw the writing; it'll make money anyway"" school of movie making. Now...as a guy who drives a SRT with over 500hp, let me comment on the cars/trucks of Mad Max. Once again they ruin everything with designs that look silly if not downright stupid. Go look at some of the crazy off-road rides out there and you'll see what bad-assary is all about. The vehicles of Mad Max are designed for a toy market and that's a damn shame. The original Max rides looked genuine, scavenged and hard-core. The cars of Fury Road look like rejects from Herman Munsters garage. Poor Max doesn't even get his V8 Interceptor (AKA Ford Falcon). What the hell is Max without his special car? Finally (yes, we're there), the audience did not like the movie and people were vocal about it. Take a look at the fan reviews on IMDB, which have dropped 10 full points in a single day.  Now someone is going to try to tell me that all of these flaws are somehow excusable because of the ""type"" of movie it is. Hogwash. This is nothing more than great effects/stunts unsupported by good writing. That's it. There's no excuse for that.  Like a teenager getting laid for the first time, Mad Max is fumbling, awkward, ineffectual and comes way too soon. It does about the worst thing a movie can do: It made me wishing it would end sooner. * 1/2",0,4,Robert Brody,YWNWi-ZWL3c,-0.06419706180344474,2015-05-18 14:50:29,False,True

2015-05-25T18:08:17,"There come times in movie history where a genre defining film is created, something so magnificent and grand that it forever affects the films of the future. Mad Max: Fury Road is a film that your grandchildren will ask if you saw it in theaters, and those of us who did will be proud to tell our children ""yes."" The movie begins with picking the audience up and placing them in the universe of Mad Max: where packs of roving guzzoline seeking bandits and psychopaths dwell, killing all who oppose them, and where two headed, irradiated lizards are eaten raw without a second thought. The sheer deadness of the world is gorgeous, and the fact that they use very little CGI brings it home. When the audience sees the stunts, cars flipping, exploding, stuntmen being thrown from them as they careen into canyon walls, they see real people and vehicles. Too often has a overly digital set and stunts made an action movie a sterile pool of disgusting brackish water, and bland characters who are either immortal or unlikable only add to it. Yet, Mad Max is the opposite: Max and Furiosa are very mortal, and their peril is real. Max is strapped to the front of a car and driven around the desert while being used as a blood bag, and Furiosa comes quite near death on several occasions. The enemies are made human by the addition of Nux, a War Boy who joins the protagonists, and only serves the Big Bad due to a religious devotion instilled in him by brainwashing. The Five Wives are very human, and compelling, given varied personalities. The movie, despite being an action packed thrill ride, makes time for subtle character development along the way. And this movie is truly a nonstop action scene. Perhaps fifteen minutes of its almost two hour stretch were slow, and its constant adrenaline rush makes one near mad. Every single bit of it is George Miller's genius, and it is truly unusual in the times of shallow plots and characters in action, where stunts are fake and blows softened by the cutting of a camera.
