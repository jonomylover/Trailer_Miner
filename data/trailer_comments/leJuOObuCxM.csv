That is the whole reason Blue has to go to Brazil in the first place. And at the end of the movie we see them with eggs and now Blue and Jewel are parents and that their is hope for their species.  Now here is something that alot of people ""probably"" never thought about. ' Who are their kids going to mate with?' Like I said, there is only Jewel, Blue, and their kids at the end of the first movie. Can't have their kids mating with eachother, that's incest.  See in the animal world inbreeding is common place, but in a family movie that is a big no no. See I think the writers and directors forgot about this little plot in the first film point and once they realized this they had to make it right.  So now in the second film it's shown that there is a whole flock of their kind, fixing the whole problem about Blue's kids finding mates one day.",2,1,InvaderMatt51394,leJuOObuCxM,0.06810064935064936,2014-03-02 06:08:31,True,True

Second, when did loggers start cutting down the whole forest (including trees with mother birds and their nests inside) with an evil look on their face? Why are you trying to make loggers sound so bad? We need wood for many things. To you people who actually think cutting down trees is bad, I'd like to see you go without paper, furniture, toilet paper, etc. And at the end of the movie, the so called ""evil"" logger boss got eaten by a snake!! Are you serious? So now these liberals who made this movie think it would be awesome for loggers to be eaten by SNAKES??? You should be ashamed of this movie, whoever made this. Whoever did make this is a bunch of left-wing environmentalists!!",1,3,Fungirl PlaysAJ,leJuOObuCxM,-0.19619883040935668,2016-04-19 05:19:42,False,False
