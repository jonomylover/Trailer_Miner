I found it fascinating until I realized it was a mostly bullshit. Jewel is an example of that but 2 other cases are even better.  I was listening and watching when the DC Sniper case was going on. I watched the so called News shows bring on ""experts"" who were just basically reading out of John Douglas or Resslers books. The so called experts would say ""They are most likely young, 25 to 35, white, above average intelligence, blah blah blah."" And we all know how that turned out. And the case of Wayne Williams and the Atlanta Child Murders. 29 victims and he went that long because since the kids were black everyone assumed it was Klan.   Here's why it was always bullshit. Back-in-the-day black people who might be budding serial killers usually got caught pretty quick because a black person prior to 1980s couldn't walk 10 feet outside the projects or hood without a cop up their butts. White guys on the other hand were able to actually rack up some kills because being white made movement easier. As for being young that's kind of a given since it takes power to subdue a potential victim. Also the guys they had caught were caught young unless you count the really ""good ones"" with the highest body counts. Like Ridgeway who began at 33 years old and may have killed as late as 52. Or Lucas who was in his 40s before he was caught. And many we probably Dont even know because they ""aged out"". Got too old to continue. And none of these guys were particularly smart. All they had to be were white and pick victims cops and society didn't care about.  My point is that profiling is based on skewed data. There are probably tons of black victims of black serial killers through out history we will never know about because the victims were the wrong color to appear on anyone give a fuck radar.",0,0,Edward Owens,gSMxBLlA8qY,0.06420634920634921,2019-10-04 00:18:51,True,True

Will everything just stop being sht and doing the EXACT same thing, making the protagonist female does not constitute new, writing a new story with characters we know in a sequel that does something new, is a sequel, this is just more gimmicky crap.  Well its official keanue has drank the kool aid, im done supporting him, Bill and ted 3 will suck, along with everything that thinks making the movie for femin azis is something new.  Women want to watch magic mike, attractive men, not other ugly women.  Sorry but this crap has to keep flopping in order for Hollywood to get the message, changing characters and arche types we love, doesn't constitute doing anything new, at this point, its already old, tired, and lame.  Only new movie ive seen this year was Blood line, and THAT was a dmn good movie.  And everytime they do this, it does nothing but hurt the older movies to where no one really wants to care anymore, h3ll I cant even watch the SW OT anymore without cringing, Hollywood is thrashed and trashed, and im pretty sure anyone who is sane and not a deranged na zi like soci opath who only cares about the col or of peoples sk in and se x, will dislike whatever hollysu ck is doing now.  Casting a women in the matrix instead of using neo, and everything else, is killing movies and alienating fans, movies are modern mythology and you would change the story of Hercules to make him a women.  But good luck, you hacks, Im sure the movies with clear political agenda behind them will all fail miserably, notice how joker made money, it wasn't honest, it was more political crap, but it appeared honest.  In the end, you will all see, politically motivated story decisions will not create more profit, youre analysts are wrong, and only time has told.  Please get cancer and stop making movie because you are running everything fans love, Disney is wrong, just watch ep 9 flop harder than any other Star wars movie.  you are all hacks, and this is a warning, keep it up, and you will have a fraction of the fans, probably not even that, because Ive already stopped going to the movies, ALL together.",0,0,Neuro Mancer,gSMxBLlA8qY,0.03216054778554778,2019-10-17 00:12:45,True,True

I've noticed in the comments that people are just going ""oh wow, the media are being biased, I've never seen that before"", but to those who do not listen to the mainstream media (and what I'm about to say), I say this. 3. Firstly, yes, the media can be error prone; I know they're not mistake-free gods. And yes, there is sometimes a tendency to push narratives. But pushing a narrative to the point where it destroys a man's life does not happen all the time. It can happen, but that doesn't mean that it should delegitimize everything that is published or broadcast by the media. But I still have to admit, Richard Jewell's case is a really bad worst-case scenario for when narratives get forced onto people. 4.

Anyway this script has been in the works for years, i think even back when Jonah and Leo did Wolf of Wall St. together it was rumored they wanted to get to work on this right after, but it fell through.  So this has zero to do with ""the Donald"", but it's certainly a story that shows nothings changed over the last 20 years between the Media and FBI.  Neither institution should be given an ounce of your trust or respect, because they certainly have zero for the average American citizen.",0,0,BIGBRY Tunney,gSMxBLlA8qY,0.08683035714285714,2019-11-16 06:31:31,True,True

This movie will give me further insight into how they picked on Richard Jewel knowing that Murphy Building Supply, Radio Shack and Duncan Oil we‚Äôre behind the Oklahoma City Bombing and was planning on blowing up the FBI in Mobile but I and the GBI chief investigator overseeing the Centennial Park investigation and client of mine are who foiled the bombing of the FBI January 29, 1998 when the trio Matt McRae, Eric Rudolph and Joey Davis drove the truck bomb and Eric‚Äôs truck to Birmingham and set out the bomb Joey Davis set off injuring abortionist Emily Lyons and killing Birmingham police officer Sanders while Eric and Matt drove down to Mobile that morning in hopes of killing 350 federal agents in Mobile with a more enhanced truck bomb they used in Oklahoma City. I wish Richard Jewel were still alive because in a way he saved my life and this nation from a second civil war the pedophile domestic terrorist organization Army of God. Eric Rudolph can only dream about having sex with underage teens in the SuperMax prison in Florence but I intend to ask President Trump to House GBI Director Vic Reynolds and other Cobb County officials to serve their prison sentences with the Pedophile Army of God.

But just watching this trailer felt like this was made for me (not like as a present but like something such as a coincidence). On my birthday, I want and have a strong need to watch this. Though my family rarely watches movies, this is something special. I don‚Äôt want to beg and waste my parents‚Äô money on something that I want because I don‚Äôt want to be a burden nor spoiled, so I‚Äôll rewatch this trailer on my birthday.    ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you pay yourself?‚Äù Whenever I receive money, I never use it on anything I don‚Äôt need like toys and gift cards. I always worry for my parents since they are the ones who earn money, work hard, take care of us, and buy/make food. Sometimes I wonder if I passed away like if I committed suicide, maybe their decrease in money would slow down. Maybe they would have a better life instead of wasting it on a useless person like me who was seen like a burden and even an antisocial human. So when receiving money, I always gave it to them, even if it was $100, $50, $10- any money I had in my pockets were given to them.  Well, years have passed and I‚Äôm gradually saving up money. If I get a large amount of money one day in the future, I‚Äôd give it all to them. If one day in my life will remember this trailer, I‚Äôd find a way to buy and watch it and rethink and look back into the past.   Sorry if I sounded emotional. Please don‚Äôt take this wrong and assume I am using this video as a place for like-camping and attention. I just feel, well, thankful for this movie/trailer. Sometimes I look at certain things and look back at how it used to be. How I used to be very happy in the past. How I used to be kind to everyone. But I don‚Äôt feel like I have the ability change who I am, though I can.   I‚Äôll be adding this to my Absolute Favorites playlist. I feel thankful for this trailer. Once again, sorry if I sound as if I‚Äôm begging for attention and likes and sympathy. I‚Äôm not.

The problem is not law enforcement nor journalists in general...its that TRUTH is not the priority of particular 'stone-hearted' idolmakers.  TRUTH ought to matter first, IF its a race to the TOP...if not, then sadly, 'headlines' (shock, scandal and dread) and 'scoop' (malice, destruction and fear) with only perfunctory,  cursory, 'veneer only' -regard or even no regard for the TRUTH is a sure race to the very bottom, perhaps hell itself!",0,0,Dr. Edwconr,gSMxBLlA8qY,0.24953703703703706,2019-12-16 15:29:16,False,True

Er hat auf die richtigen Probleme aufmerksam gemacht und bei mir die ganze Zeit das gef√ºhl hervorgerufen mich √ºber die dummheiten der Menschheit aufzuregen. Dies ging mir zuweilen sehr auf die Nerven. Er erzeugte eine unglaubliche Atmosph√§re und war mitrei√üend. Aber ich fand das die Handlung schlecht dargestellt war und das gesammte Konstrukt sehr vorhersehbar und einseitig war. Die Medien haben versagt und die Polizei auch...  Wow wie besonders und einzigartig ist das denn. Muss gestehen das ich mir mehr erhofft hatte und selbst die Szenen die mich ergriffen haben irgendwie plumb und ein bisschen spontan kamen ( sie wurden meiner meinung nach nicht vern√ºnftig aufgebaut).

The performances of Olivia Wilde and Jon Hamm were solid, but Kathy Bates, Sam Rockwell and Paul, by God, Paul Walter Hauser were the best, they never left the script for a second, they took their roles seriously and managed to be praised by the public. Unfortunately, the movie turned out to be a box office failure that grossed just $ 43 million against a budget of $ 45 million, and that seems disrespectful to me.  Richard Jewell shows us as a guy who saved thousands of people's lives from an attack, they point out that he is guilty of planting that bomb and being considered a ""false hero"", when in fact HE was the hero and still is.
