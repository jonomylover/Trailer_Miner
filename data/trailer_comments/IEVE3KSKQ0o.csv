Anyone who knows the comics knows how important Ant-Man is in general to Marvel even though general audience might not know much about him. The trailer had a good message could have done with more Ant-Man footage and a slight look on Yellow Jacket. I know they will show more in the next trailer but this movie needs to show more to reel people in. It has the same case of GOTG but the result might be not good in sales. And if there is a scene where I get to see where Ant-Man changes his size to a giant this movie will be pretty awesome.

Isn't it supposed to be fun? This looks ridiculously generic. Bunch of cops, cheesy slow motion, people in suits walking through glass corridors and boring scenarios. We got to see Ant-Man do his thing as Ant-Man only twice during this trailer and the visuals still look fuzzy, shaky, quick and unclear. I know it's incomplete... but why show anything this dull and lifeless? I want fun music. I want action. I want to see the funny side of things. Who in the world thought showing Paul Rudd as a brooding hero would work? The source material has lots of potential. This film could be great if done properly. But I get the feeling that nobody involved is into it. I'm sure the people making this trailer weren't. It just looks like the work of an amateur editor with very dull material to work with. I'm not a comic book reader but I have steadily enjoyed most of Marvel films, and this looks like their first flop. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" did so well because it had life and color.

2015-01-20T06:01:10,"Guys, let get this straight, and note, this is my own observation and opinion. DC comic settings are quite amazing, however, in my opinion, they lack in movie making. Their TV Series are amazing though, such as Flash Arrow, Gotham, and many animated TV Series. I believe Marvel and DC are equal and incomparable in comics. Marvel focuses on Movies, it excels on single larger things, where as DC focuses on MANY smaller things, equaling up to quite the same. So if you only base the argument of Marvel vs. DC in movie terms, there is no point, They both have their own set of weaknesses and strengths. And it just so happens that Marvel's strength is making Movies, where as DC's strength is making smaller TV Shows and Animated Movies.",0,0,Caleb Maddox,IEVE3KSKQ0o,0.1876984126984127,2015-01-20 06:01:10,True,True

Probably why they're so popular and marvel keeps spittin out more and more of them.  I enjoy most of these marvel movies, they're a good watch if nothing else because most movies these days seem kinda dull and there's not much to compare them against anymore.

2015-02-20T01:53:14,"So I've been reading down in the comments that Marvel is better than DC.  LMAO. It is.  Batman and its villains should be its own entity, separate from the DC universe (in any medium). They are by far the most intriguing, psychological, and fleshed out characters in either brand.  Superman might as well be Jesus. If you have Superman, you could do away with 2/3 of the JLA.  As well as it may have worked in comics, I don't see how a righteous (Bat)man can defeat a Superman without Kryptonite... which they seem to have explained away in 'Man of Steel' as being atmospheric pressure.  So, as far as movies go, if we have Lex as an incredibly wealthy genius, hellbent on defeating Superman... why do we need Bruce Wayne/Batman? We don't. Batman should have remained the way the X-Men do; as a different universe altogether, separate from the Avengers.  Oh well.

The director, Peyton Reed has directed many terrible comedy movies, but is that really down to him? Not really. The writers are usually to blame for it, and once the script is done and dusted the director just directs it. It also looks like Paul Rudd and Adam McKay will be responsible for the screenplay and Rudd's records look pretty OK, but McKay's looking a bit more dangerous.  I just hope that Peyton finally get's a grip and goes all out for Ant-Man and I hope that it will succeed with reviews and money.  Please, for the love of god Ant-Man, don't fail me or anyone else. If you do I will have to shrug it off and say 'well, that broke the perfect record.'
