2015-09-17T22:30:52,"t Heaven or hell? Make that decision today, you're not promised tomorrow. According to the Word of God, there is not a righteous person on earth (Romans 3:10) Because all have sinned and come short of the glory of God(Romans 3:23). Here's how a holy God defines evil: Whoever hates his brother is a murderer (1 John 3:15). Ever hated anyone? Ever told a lie?The Word of God states that "" All liars will have their part in the lake of fire "". In Revelation 21:8. Ever looked at someone with lust? Jesus said looking with lust is committing adultery in your heart (Matt. 5:28). Ever stolen anything? No thief and adulterer will inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:9,10).Because God is holy, He must punish all who sin, and His place of punishment is hell for all eternity.So you see, we've all done these things, we all deserve hell.And If you've done even one of these things, and have not repented and believed on Jesus, you currently are on your way to hell.God's standard of goodness is perfection,in thought, word, and deed so none of us can ever make it to heaven on our own. We are sinful, and even one sin will keep us from heaven. But In His great love and mercy, God provided a way for us to be forgiven of our sins and saved from that punishment. Through the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross to pay the penalty for your sins. I am sure you have heard of John 3:16? It's the most famous verse in the Bible, it reads "" For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life ."" If you believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, and resurrected from the dead, you will be forgiven of all your sins and saved from hell.(Acts 13:38, Acts 16:30,31)",1,2,Lemuel St,lNzukD8pS_s,0.125,2015-09-17 22:30:52,False,False

2015-09-23T11:45:58,"Tomorrowland what went wrong? Its been out for a while and now just about to come out on Blu ray and having seen the film twice now I can see where the film went wrong.  1. The Protagonist is the wrong person. The first 15 mins of Tomorrowland are the best part. It introduces a likable character Frank Walker who has an interesting story and character arc. If the film centered on Frank Walker and perhaps his daughter it would have been a more focused and nuanced story.  2. Casey Newton. Her character comes off as a very unlikable and abrasive know it all. Also they spend a lot of time introducing her brother and father who suddenly disappear half way through the film. Her character is more reactionary than having anything to do with the story or themes.  3. The Robots. The robots are the villains in Tomorrowland and don't come off as any kind of threat, they are overly cartoonish and almost impossible to take seriously. The solution make the bad guys Tomorrowland inductees turned bad with futuristic gadgets at their disposal.  4. The Environmental Message. Tomorrowland has a very heavy hand message about ecology and how we are destroying the planet. It comes off like a bad after school special. Perhaps the theme should be focused on inspiring humanity to be better rather than berating us about current sociological and political problems.  5. A waste of Hugh Laurie. By far the best part of this film is Hugh Laurie as David Nix but unfortunately he is hardly in the film. I was waiting for his character to be revealed as somewhat threatening and competent bad guy but that never happened. To make a bad guy interesting you have to make him relatable but again that never happened.  6. The Pins. This is an interesting plot device but hardly used in the story its more of a throw away plot device. If it was tied into the climax of the film it would have made more sense. Also the pins are very dangerous what if you touch one while crossing the street you will almost certainly be killed. At least address this in the film and upgrade them.  7. Ideas. This film has interesting ideas but doesnt know what to do with them. The concept of Tommorowland as utopia for the best and brightest is interesting but never followed through. The pins are interesting and unique  but are only used as a superficial plot device. The idea of kid who had big dreams but had them crushed and grew up to be old and bitter is interesting but never followed up upon.  Tomorrowland is all about ambition and inspiration but wasn't ambitious enough to try something new and push the envelope. It talked down to the audience not trusting the kids watching enough to think for themselves. The best stories challenge the audience to think and ponder after the credits have rolled but if they have already been told what to think and what conclusions to make then what is the point?",3,4,Purefoldnz,lNzukD8pS_s,0.08461317435001647,2015-09-23 11:45:58,False,False

2018-12-03T19:52:46,"The movie had a fantastic opening at the 1964 World's Fair and then it went downhill from there. Brad Bird made a somewhat entertaining but not at all exceptional film about a possible future for us all. This movie was bogged down by a depressing plot and an even more depressing Tomorrowland visit. I was hoping for a Jetson's style movie with amazing architecture and technology, but instead I got robots, climate change lectures, NASA closures and George Clooney being annoyed by his surroundings for two hours. Disney should have taken the 200+ million they spent on this and made TRON III instead.",0,0,Mufnstuf,lNzukD8pS_s,0.09365079365079364,2018-12-03 19:52:46,False,False

It is not possible for us as humans to love the world because the world will be destroyed and all living things will die except the substance of Allah Almighty.  In Islam can find the world but cannot leave the afterlife because eternal life is the afterlife.  Disney filmed this movie because it depicted the future they imagined apart from the fact that they knew it and embraced the destructive reality of the destruction that came from human hands but they rejected it as a result of the love of the world.  that will end.  however, giving up is not the only thing that is worthwhile.
