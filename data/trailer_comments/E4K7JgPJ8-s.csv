From there, he'll meet some technician who wants to help fix him and make his body more competitive to win the piston cup. There will be parts where it might go back to doc's (Hudson hornet) race days that 'inspire' McQueen or the times with doc and McQueen that we didn't get to see between cars and cars 2. I'm sure it's gonna go back to radiator springs or at least see some of the other characters. The trailer looks good and I hope the final product meets with the expectations of a good Pixar movie and not flop like some others films that didn't do so well.",5,0,Giraffe George,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.21853535353535355,2016-11-22 00:54:09,True,True

2016-11-22T05:24:57,"Cars 3 Lighting Mcqueen is a car who grows up dreaming of going fast. Mcqueen acts as a replacement driver after Terry decides to take a break while in last place. After starting in last place in place of Cheveaux, McQueen finishes in third place. McQueen becomes the new great in the NASCAR and gains fame and fortune at Dennit Racing. While racing, he kisses his wife, Sally.Mcqueen persuades Dennit Racing to sponsor an additional team car. McQueen arranges to have his best friend, Mater, on his team. While Mcqueen and Mater succeed throughout competitions, their new teammate, French Formula One rival Jackson Storm is tough to beat. He outperforms them to become Piston's latest success story.Desperate to dominate, Mcqueen exceeds his limitations and crashes at Charlotte Motor Speedway, which included his car rolling and flipping in the air.While paramedics attempt to take him to the hospital, Mcqueen runs around on the track. Wearing only his helmet and underwear,  insists he is on fire. During his recovery, McQueen believes he is paralyzed. After deliberately stabbing himself in the leg, he realizes that he is not.Now, McQuenn is eager to rejoin the NASCAR circuit. Before a race at Rockingham Speedway, Mcqueen completed a test drive, but fear caused him to drive exceedingly slow. Mcqueen is fired from Dennit Racing and his pit crew now works for storm. Jamie McMurray acts as McQueen's replacement for the Rustiees car. Desperate to remain wealthy, Sally divorces McQueen and marries Mater. After accusing Mater of ruining his life, McQueen ends their friendship.Lightning moves in with his mom, Lucy Mcqueen. McQueen's  sons, Walker and Texas Ranger join him as he works as a pizza delivery car. After colliding with a shopping cart, McQueen loses his driver's license and he is reduced to using a bicycle.While McQueen is not well, his father, Reese, teaches him to drive with a live cougar in his car. After his father leaves, McQueen talks to his assistant and partner, Susan, who persuades him to return to NASCAR, since it is in his nature to drive fast. After deciding to take Susan's advice and race at the Talladega 500, Lightning and Susan become love interests. With the Talladega 500 on his mind, McQueen gathers a race car and pit crew.Before the race, McQueen makes amends with Sally, Girard and Mater, while uniting with his pit crew chief and close friend, Doc Hudson. McQueen is forced to start in last place, after spare parts were donated to build the engine in McQueen's new race car. At the start of the race, McQueen passes all of the drivers, except Girard. In the closing laps, Mater uses a slingshot technique for McQueen to pass Girard.The replacement driver of the Rustees car causes a massive wreck that causes all drivers to crash, excluding Mcqueen and Girard. On the final lap of the race, McQueen and Girard collide with each other and their race cars roll towards the finish line. McQueen and Girard exit their cars and run towards the finish line. In the background, ""We Belong"" by Pat Benatar is playing. McQueen wins the race, but he and Girard are disqualified for exiting their cars, so Mater officially wins the Talladega 500. At the time of the first major crash, Mater was in third place.Being the sore loser he is, McQueen drives off a cliff and diesTHE END!",2,3,MrHomestarJughead,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.08618380777471685,2016-11-22 05:24:57,True,True

The reason Incredibles 2 took so long is because the director of the first Incredibles, Brad Bird, was busy with other projects, and since it was his idea, they probably didn't want to make the film without him.   Anyways, I wasn't excited for Cars 3 until I saw this. Might be the best animation Pixar has done yet.

2016-11-22T05:35:54,"I have a theory. At 0.23 we briefly see Lightning McQueen with flame decals on his car. The NASCAR driver who was known for flame decals on his car was Jeff Gordon, a racer who exploded onto the NASCAR scene (much like McQueen in the original movie) but was seen by many as past his prime and retired in late 2015 after a fruitless but competitive run at a Cup victory. The 2015 racing season would be a logical time for the story of Cars 3 to be conceived, given that animated movies take a year or two (or sometimes three) to produce. Jeff Gordon also made a cameo in Cars 2 as the voice of Jeff Corvette, so we know Pixar and Gordon have worked together in the past. So, my conclusion is that this movie borrows heavily from the career of one of the greatest NASCAR drivers of all time: Jeff Gordon.",1,0,Cody Swanson,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.1325,2016-11-22 05:35:54,True,True

Mqueen was probably pushing too hard on his engine causing too much strain and blew out causing a horrible crash just like The Hudson Hornet and The King's crash. Mqueen then gets a remake using the advanced technology of McMissile and Agent Hoffwell (was it hoffwell, haven't watched cars 2 in a while) or Sally and the mechanical knowledge of Doc. With all his advancements Mqueen now enters another race and tries to beat the new electric car rookie.

And then maybe McQueen wants a comeback or a challenge for who's the fastest(who doesn't love to break a new record of speed?) and so McQueen may find his limits but refuses it and I don't want to say this but becoming stubborn again?ANOTHER THEORY(short one) the end part ---From this moment... EVERYTHING WILL CHANGE--- what if that falls apart the same as Doc Hudson? McQueen becomes another legends history?and again this is what I think of it, also if you made this far thanks and apologies for my English I tried my best :D(I have a feeling that this theory isn't fully completed, obviously in guess)",0,0,Sunday,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.18620621802439982,2016-11-22 16:41:13,True,True

I personally think it will be similar to Planes Fire and Rescue in the aspect in that something will limit him and he will have to either get something done to him like retire or try to get back into the race at a huge risk of not being able to work properly again ( Like Skipper in Disneys Planes Fire And Rescue) and everyone will be skeptical about what is going to happen, will the new car that isn't in the same style in Mcqueen win ir will Mcqueen win his one last race in the New race?

Since he is older than Flash,  he retired from racing and now train Rookies. Now that would start like The opening race for a new season Flash getting ready since he is a veteran his getting ready when suddently he hear his name from a know voice which is Chick. Anyway, he go see him and then tease each other. Then at the end, he just point to Flash an electric car and say ""It's my rookie, I trained him by myself and he gonna beat you"" Then Flash is just whatever it's his first season, nothing to worry about. Then race begin, few laps later Flash realize how munch he underestimate Chick Rookie and decide to push himself to the limit in order to beat him and not be humiliated by Chick. Sadly, he commit an error he already done in the past. He don't change his tires in order to not lose time . His tires explode, he try to slown down but lose control and then crash himself.  He survive the crash but won't be able to run ever again and will have larges troubles to move without assistance (exactly where Mater could be finally usefull and a revelant character).

2016-11-23T05:54:26,I believe that cars 3 is going to be about the new trend of hybrid supercars and how McQueen is struggling to keep up with them. The only reason he was able to catch up is that he avoided going to the pit stop and in doing so he popped a tire which led to the crash. Now McQueen is going under intensive care and the only to save him is to change all of his damaged parts. Which will bring the rise of a hybrid Lightning McQueen.,2,0,Francisco Lopez,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.1590909090909091,2016-11-23 05:54:26,True,True

The description states, "" and a few unexpecting turns,"" and "" From this moment, everything will change.""

I feel they rushed the good dinosaur out the door because of the success of inside out. it was fun to watch, but the story sucked. i understand that new ideas can be difficult and risky. please pixar I don't want to see 4 more toy sequels.",2,3,Shane,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.23295454545454544,2016-11-23 07:05:54,True,True

Just looking at this i can say that this movie is gonna be about lightning  trying to bring himself back. He seems to have an accident and i think this movie is gonna be about fighting through the odds and coming back after something bad. It isnt too dark. Its realistic. This is what kids need to see. Something real. Something that can teach them something. Look at Inside Out it taught kids that sometimes you need to be sad to feel happy. Zootopia taught kids about accepting, even though some is label as scary or mean based on their race doesnt mean that everyone is. Incredibles taught kids it was ok to be different.

Remember it's 2016/2017 electric cars are very relevant. And with his new body he would have to practice before he gets into anymore races.

2016-11-23T13:26:25,"If you read the description it's kinda easy to see where this is going. The organisers of the piston cup are wanting to go green with their races (relevant to modern racing times) but their leading star Lightning McQueen doesn't want to change having realised who he really is in the first Cars. So the piston cup organiser's set up a one off race to determine what's the future for the sport, hybrid engines or standard gasoline engines. I think this trailer is about this one off race. the reason is because there are still gasoline engines to be heard and electrical whines from the hybrid cars. I also feel like McQueen would have had a falling out with his old friends from radiator springs as he's obviously not pitted and stuck to his way of ""Gass no tyres"". This to me seems like he's gone back to his old self before radiator springs because his friends have gone with the ""hybrid"" way of thinking and that sets McQueen down a path of self destruction that ends in a bad wreck which sees the piston cup become a hybrid only competition. This failure forces McQueen to leave town disgusted and outed by the sport he loves he hits rock bottom until a new friendly technician recognises him and slowly but surely coaxes McQueen to a state of acceptance. With McQueen found his old friends surprise him pleading with him to just try it. So McQueen becomes hybrid and goes on his first drive and realises the power of hybrid and the clean running like nature intended (imagine McQueen and Sally driving scene) So eventually this leads McQueen to try and re enter the Piston Cup to prove he's still got what it takes but the Owners have a new poster boy (he's not a bad guy) and don't want him until he shows off/tells them he's hybrid. He gets put back into the series and having missed out on some races finds himself with his back against the wall in trying to win every races with his old and new friends. The final race, it's all down between the new poster boy and a resurgent McQueen. But disaster strikes as McQueen suffers an electrical fault and has another wreck on the last lap. He's finished he thinks but then he gets a push from behind as the new posterboy is pushing him over the line. McQueen has a flashback and realises he did this once before suddenly realising he's come full circle, he's the legend and the posterboy is the new rookie. With McQueen finishing infront of poster boy he wins the Piston Cup. The end could pretty much write itself. McQueen gives the Rookie words of wisdom, McQueen retires and enjoys a nice relaxing drive with all his friends. The End.  Or that's how I think it will go anyways!!",0,1,Ryan Hamilton,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.07895342312008978,2016-11-23 13:26:25,True,True

To get back in the game, he will need the help of an eager young race technician, Cruz Ramirez, with her own plan to win, plus inspiration from the late Fabulous Hudson Hornet and a few unexpected turns. Proving that #95 isn’t through yet will test the heart of a champion on Piston Cup Racing’s biggest stage!*  Mcqueen doesn't die. The teaser is just setting the tone for the movie at how it isn't going to be flowers and rainbows, but rather determination and rising back to glory. TL:DR me, I really do not care.

I personally think it will be similar to Planes Fire and Rescue in the aspect in that something will limit him and he will have to either get something done to him like retire or try to get back into the race at a huge risk of not being able to work properly again ( Like Skipper in Disneys Planes Fire And Rescue) and everyone will be skeptical about what is going to happen, will the new car that isn't in the same style in Mcqueen win ir will Mcqueen win his one last race in the New race?

2016-11-24T03:28:04,Time to share my prediction: P1 when lighting McQueen crashes his eyes are closed or are they? Either they are or they are in a different dimension where cars aren't real it's just drivers.P2 when you see Mcqueen's spoiler it's different from the one in cars 2 and looks like the one from cars 1 so this could be taking place in the past.FYI in cars 2 McQueen had the racing spoiler from the race and probably switched it out.,0,3,Prime,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.025,2016-11-24 03:28:04,True,True

2016-11-24T07:21:55,"From this moment, everything will change.  Disney/Pixar's Cars 3 opens in US theatres in 3D June 16, 2017.  Blindsided by a new generation of blazing-fast racers, the legendary Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) is suddenly pushed out of the sport he loves. To get back in the game, he will need the help of an eager young race technician, Cruz Ramirez, with her own plan to win, plus inspiration from the late Fabulous Hudson Hornet and a few unexpected turns. Proving that #95 isn’t through yet will test the heart of a champion on Piston Cup Racing’s biggest stage!  Cars 3 is directed by Brian Fee (storyboard artist “Cars,” “Cars 2“) and produced by Kevin Reher (“A Bug’s Life,” “La Luna” short).",7,2,Vallery Shipp,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.17395104895104893,2016-11-24 07:21:55,True,True

There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’  So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.  ‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.  Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.  ‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.  She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.  I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

2016-11-24T22:35:43,I'm gonna guess based on these 49seconds that Mcqueen is old and worn out so he crashes or/and cant keep up with the newer cars and has to have had many modifications to keep winning which eventually takes a toll and he crashes. Mcqueen's career is over and now he coaches a car that is superior in specs but naive and immature etc.  the black car coming through the center is either the villain (who had something to do with Mcqueens career ending) and so the kid has to beat or is the kid himself who is shocked by Mcqueens crash and his career ending and wants to continue his legacy etc.   Or and most likely the trailer is purposefully misleading.,0,0,drabnail777,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.11212121212121211,2016-11-24 22:35:43,True,True

But then... I'm laughing just typing this, because--*what?* there are just so many things you have to wonder, like: is this trailer just a dark and edgy looking thing to catch interest, but the actual movie far from it, or will the movie legitimately feature this lighting, colouring, and overall moodier cinematography and story? How would they even manage that with these cartoon cars? And who came up with this idea, anyway? Did they just burst into the office like, ""Sandra, you won't believe how brilliant this idea I've just come up with is right now! You know our movies about little cartoon cars with a target audience ranging from three to eight years old?""

2016-11-25T18:16:43,"McQueen struggles to compete against this new set of modern rookie racers, with new and improved aerodynamical efficiency. 00:23 it looks like McQueen trying to drift on asphalt, these are new tricks which he isn't built to do. Lightning's main racing rival (#20) is dominating the speedway - as well as other fresh race cars. Cruz Ramirez is stated to be a young technician, out to help the 'champion' Lightning McQueen. After the terrifying crash his vehicle will need to be renewed to perform again, I am guessing, Cruz installs new parts onto Lightning in order for him to be able to compete (have a chance of winning); keep his racing legacy. Ramirez's dreams of being a technician succeeds as the all-star takes what is his own, the Piston Cup! However, there are several other sources which highlight their own respected perspectives, or elaborate on specific aspects. The movie will focus on the emotional end of each character, especially McQueen. It seems like the 'Lightning' in his name is an alias given by the fans to resemble his speed, sadly, it no longer works and I wouldn't be surprised if it has been made a mockery of... His friends and family more importantly we will be seeing more of than the actual comedy, racing action etc. Most of the events will relate back to the 'legendary' Hudson hornet as they share similar stories, the King has more than likely retired. This is a story-driven movie instead of the comedic tone in the first installment, or spy-action as in the second franchise, this one picks up a darker tone that, gradually lightens throughout till the end. //NOTE: It doesn't seem like the skid, or even a tyre puncture, can cause his vehicle to flip over! Scene(s) has definitely occured on separate timescales not one after another. Thank You for your time reading my opinion-based comment. I would not mind argumentative replies.

They should have release it much earlier, a lot of the kids that grew up with this are now teenagers not willing to watch this. And this is not the first time they did this with a series either.

2016-11-30T22:59:34,"READ THIS.. From this moment, everything will change.  Disney/Pixar's Cars 3 opens in US theatres in 3D June 16, 2017.  Blindsided by a new generation of blazing-fast racers, the legendary Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) is suddenly pushed out of the sport he loves. To get back in the game, he will need the help of an eager young race technician, Cruz Ramirez, with her own plan to win, plus inspiration from the late Fabulous Hudson Hornet and a few unexpected turns. Proving that #95 isn’t through yet will test the heart of a champion on Piston Cup Racing’s biggest stage!

2016-12-01T15:20:30,"I do see a lot of people commenting about how this is similar to Doc Hudson's accident mentioned in Cars 1 because he crashed in a race of his.  I do agree with this, but that makes me think that us, as the audience, might finally be able to see what actually happened to Doc Hudson instead of McQueen and Hudson talking about it with a newspaper article of the accident behind them.   There is also another thing that I would like to bring up as well: During McQueen's shot before the accident, we don't really see what happens to him causing him to crash into the wall followed by him flipping over his side with debris flying everywhere. There are two things that come to my mind during that moment:  1. At the beginning of McQueen's scene, we see him use his breaks, veer left, then veer right into the wall on his right. Now, I'm not one to know about car racing so I probably shouldn't say this, but I don't think it's possible to crash into a wall like that then go into a full side flip. I feel like he crashed into the wall, slowly rolled backwards/forwards, and got hit by the other racers, causing him to flip over.  2. Not only is it similar to the Hudson crash, but the King from Cars 1 sort-of went out like this as well when Chick Hicks bumped into him causing him to flip out into the grass.

As he tries to get to the top of this type of racing (i think) in the finale race he crashes to the side and flips. Lighting passed away and its over for Lightning.

2016-12-13T03:48:26,"If Lightning gets bebuild into a Hybrid like Prius, I would imagine  Mater will pay off all of this company to do Hybrid cars to get his  friend to rebuild into one of their cars with the money that he earned  from Cars 2 (I haven't saw the movie) and him as being the spokesperson  for Dinoco. I think Mater will give up all of it to save his best  buddy,because we known Lightning did anything for him last two movies  and I think Mater will return the favor for him to save his life in the  beginning of Cars 3 after the accident.   If you remember in Cars that they were cow-tiping (I would love to see that if they do that again), Lightning told Mater that he was thinking about getting remodel if he becomes the next spokesperson for Dinoco after he won the Pinest Cup. But at the end,Lightning turned down King's offer after he looked after him after the King crashed and gave the spokesperson position to Mater instead. I think Mater will sacrifice his fame and glory to go back as a regular Tow mater to help his little race car friend to get back on the track. I think that would be nice if Mater do that for little Lightning McQueen in order to save his little buddy,because I would imagine Mater would be heartbroken after his best friend crashed like this.  But I think Mater won't tell Lightning that he signed a contract with the car company to has Lightning to get rebuild after the accident,because I think he always known Lightning wanted to get remodel since the 1st Cars movie and he thinks it is what's best for him. I think he will keep this secret between him and Sally,but probably Lightning will figure out that Mater is the one who signs the deal with the company to has him remodel and Lightning probably will be upset that Mater gives up anything to save him. I also think will be mad at Mater at first because signs him up without his submission,but I think Lightning probably will forgive him and ending up thanking him.",0,0,Shelli Ingle,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.15334967320261436,2016-12-13 03:48:26,True,True

2016-12-19T06:03:56,"LOOK AT DESCRIPTION From this moment, everything will change.  Disney/Pixar's Cars 3 opens in US theatres in 3D June 16, 2017.  Blindsided by a new generation of blazing-fast racers, the legendary Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) is suddenly pushed out of the sport he loves. To get back in the game, he will need the help of an eager young race technician, Cruz Ramirez, with her own plan to win, plus inspiration from the late Fabulous Hudson Hornet and a few unexpected turns. Proving that #95 isn’t through yet will test the heart of a champion on Piston Cup Racing’s biggest stage!

Now PLANES was just for marketing!! And The Good Dinosaur is hands down Pixar's weakest movie! Cars though, was an absolute masterpiece with the best plot, jokes, and characters. People just didn't appreciate it as much because not everyone is a Nascar fan! The people who are Nascar fans saw more references and jokes than the people who aren't. The people who are middle aged appreciated the movie more than the younger generation because they were able to understand the references. We went to see it 3 times when it came into theaters and it's still my mom's favorite movie to this day! Just because you couldn't understand it, doesn't mean the movie was bad!!   Also, I don't see why people hated Cars 2 either. That had a whole different feel from the first movie, but did it in an awesome way! The whole spy car mystery plot was so interesting to watch! They put more of Mater in the second movie because people loved him in the first! It wasn't as good as the first of course, but there was nothing wrong with it! People need to leave their hate on a movie that actually deserves it. Not an amazing movie like Cars.",0,0,{LucyFluffyDenDecor} AJ,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.17711988304093568,2017-02-10 03:05:22,True,True

2017-03-07T04:04:53,Well the cause of this crash was popping a tire that's how he lost control of his mobility and because his engine is overheated at 0:36 if u really look at so maybe lighting was exceeding his speed limits to pass the over cars but he  wasn't fast enough and he just lost control and that's probably u saw him shaking violently too he was trying to catch some speed: Overall my theory for this movie is just the same stuff everytime Pixar makes a cars movie   1.Mcqueen crashes  2.He has a flashback of Doc  3.He gets inspired and doesn't want to end up like him  4.The final race  5.Lighting wins  And this looks amazing it looks like a need for speed in 2020 or something,0,0,Jashawn,E4K7JgPJ8-s,0.05555555555555555,2017-03-07 04:04:53,True,True
