Oddly there isn't any mention of her in most articles about the film. But Welles must have been very familiar with FFJ. She was well-known by the media in NYC in the 30s before he made his classic flick. And note, his main character's name was Charles FOSTER Kane and his mistress was a very untalented opera singer. Consider also, that Ms. Foster was the daughter of Charles FOSTER. Film buffs often state that the Susan Alexander character is based on actress Marion Davies, mistress of newspaper tycoon William Randolf Hearst. But that's unfair to Davies who was actually a fine comedic actress. In fact, Orson Welles wrote the forward to Marion Davies autobiography and in it he apologized that people mistook her for the Susan Alexander character.",0,0,LIGHTCATCHER STUDIOS,9rRVCNffvKk,0.2770833333333333,2016-03-11 18:46:34,True,True

Simon Helberg does a wonderful job as Cosme McMoon. His scene in the elevator following his first encounter with Madame Florence is almost worth the ticket price on its own.
