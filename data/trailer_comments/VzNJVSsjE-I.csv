2019-11-14T14:16:40,I'm a fan of Gavin O Connor films a lot & his direction is kind of so organic & grounded like say even when comes to combat sequences in both The Accountant & Warrior this guy knows what he's doing & also the various other emotions he shows off in such a subtle & effective way. Also I wish Ben Affleck takes a jab at directing again cause I love all the first 3 films he made & Live by Night(i think he should've made it as a tv series instead with that amazing crew and cast cause he seemed to have crammed too much in a film & missed quite a lot of great scenes from the original novel by Denis Lehane)    Also Affleck is very underrated... he knows he doesn't have the range of other great actors but he uses that to his advantage to give a subdued range which is subtly effective & seems so natural that I'm personally a very a fan of.

I paid a locksmith to break his lock,  as I waited while the locksmith did his thing, I prayed that my brother had left his house and was with friends and I was overreacting.  The locksmith pushed open the door only to be stopped by the chain on the inside. My heart sank, and I kicked open the door and searched the apartment frantically, and at first I didnt see him....Until I looked in the bathroom where the lights were off, and there he was ... He had passed away maybe a couple of days earlier. Alone.. After years of struggling with alcoholism my brother also had to contend with Blindness which had occured over a period of 20years. and I guess it was just too much.  I wept like never before as this was the end of a long struggle with Alcoholism for my brother and to top it off it was what would have been his 59th birthday. I struggle to this very day with all of it..But my faith in God is strong, and I am thankful for that.. For Mr Affleck and everyone struggling with alcohol or drugs ...I remind you that One is too many, and a Thousand is never enough! I pray for your sobriety and I truly hope you find Your Way Back.
