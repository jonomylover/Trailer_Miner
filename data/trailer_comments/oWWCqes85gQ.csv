Stand up for children.  48 states have no laws against the corporal punishment of children in private schools. 19 states have no laws against it in public schools. The USA is the greatest abuser of children in the world. It like only Somalia refuses to sign and ratify something that over a hundred civilized countries have that recognizes the human rights of a child. Take time to learn our country's dirty secret. Take time to stand up for our most vulnerable. Adults hit, punch, kick and shove children because they know they can't hit back. I have spent the last 10 years researching these facts and others related to this countries culture of abuse toward children.  My own son was abused by a Minister at a church school in the state of Massachusetts. The Cambridge District Attorneys office of Child Abuse Investigations discovered that yes he was abused. I did not have custody of my son the mother did. She like millions of mothers and fathers in this country signed off on someone physically abusing her child as a form of punishment. From the 200 years of The Stubborn Child laws to the mass murder of children in their own schools to this disgusting culture that I just spoke of the US is not doing the right thing by children. As to my child? The district office of course did not charge the minister with child abuse. I leave it to you to ask why yourself.

2019-07-24T14:18:23,"OK. I like that they got Tom Hanks for this, but his timing on the song was WAY off. And, seeing this reminds Me of a question I've always had about the show: Why in the world did Mr. Rogers change shoes when he came into the house? I mean, I can understand putting away his jacket or sweater-vest when he came in, because he was inside, but his shoes? If you're trying to pretend the guy is in his own house, why wouldn't he put on slippers or just go with socks, if he doesn't go barefoot? Or, if it's trying to act like you're a guest in his home, wouldn't he leave the dress shoes on instead? Because changing one's shoes is NOT something I'VE ever heard be a thing to do when you have guests over. Maybe before they get there, but not WHILE they're THERE. And that's another thing: why did the Mr. Rogers' show always start out with him coming inside? If you're a guest, wouldn't YOU be the one coming in? And we know it's ""his"" house because he puts his stuff away & it's his shoes on the floor - two things you wouldn't have if you were going to somebody else's place - so it's not like you could say the show was about somebody always asking Mr. Rogers to come over or something. In short, that show was VERY confusing, on a lot of levels.

Dan is enamored with the pure Fred Rogers, always optimistic, always serving.  One day Dan tells about how when he was a kid, his dad could never come to his little league games because he had to work long hours in the factory to feed the family.  Then came the championships, and the dad took a whole day off work just for him... but never showed up‚Äîbecause he was killed by an angry mob after MLK was assassinated.  And that's why he became a reporter, to stick it to bad people, politicians, economic abusers, slumlords...  Fred empathizes, then asks if he can be his new dad and gives him an old Daniel Tiger puppet to cement some metaphor.  Dan becomes good and shadows Fred and all the kind things he does.  Meanwhile, Dan keeps ignoring calls from his bosses, who leave voicemails saying ""if you don't have some dirt on our desk by next Friday, you're fired!""  All is well, but then a kid from the hospital dies and Dan relapses and disappears, turning in a scathing expose of Mr. Rogers, how he gives people false hope in an ultimately dreary world, and by making people feel calm and loved kept people from getting angry and actually solving their problems proactively.  In effect Mr. Roger's Neighborhood elongated Vietnam/Civil Rights/Nixon/etc, making him complicit _at best_.  Dan's girlfriend breaks up with him, saying they used to be so idealistic when they first met, and Dan responds with a speech about ""the real world isn't all friendly neighbors and cable cars mislabeled as trolleys."" [Yeah, he said it!] He throws the puppet in the trash, ruining it.  Dan goes on a binge spree, living up the media sell-out life, but inwardly feels sad that he threw a good man under the bus and now can't contain the monster he created, having scandalized Fred's name.  He quits his job and apologizes to Mr. Rogers, who quickly forgives him, tells of when he once was tempted to give up but didn't, and says ""go get 'em Daniel Tiger!,"" sending Dan to catch his girlfriend's flight.  Cut to an epilogue about how Mr. Rogers just died and that made Dan remember that epiphanical assignment, his now wife and three kids, and that moment he decided to become an award-winning children's book author.

2019-07-25T22:15:27,"Looks like another addition to a great season of biopics. I would very much like Hollywood to do one  on Jared Fogle, the former Subway spokesperson and now convicted felon,  roly-poly-boy-toy and daily punching bag for any number of his fellow inmates at the federal penitentiary in Englewood, Colorado.     Perhaps it could be a musical.   One of the numbers could be called ""Smaller Pants,"" and two different versions could both open and close the production.  In the beginning, Jared sings ""I wanna get in smaller pants,"" in reference to his desire to lose weight by eating only veggie subs.  At the end prior to his arrest, as he's flying around the country molesting children, he could sing the same line, but it would of course have a far more sinister meaning.     Another number could involve a couple of parents going to the authorities to report that their pre-adolescent son has been victimized by Fogle.  The song could be titled ""He Went to Jared.""     You see, I'm a dead ringer for Fogle.   We're talking ""separated at birth"" identical.   Up until November, 2015 I had a fairly steady part time gig posing as him and entertaining at kids' birthday parties.  For a reasonable fee, I'd provide the entertainment (balloon animals and showing the kids the former pants with a 48 inch waistline that ""Jared"" used to have to wear before he started eating Subway veggies subs everyday) and the food (a Subway platter). Needless to say, my tax returns for the past few years have shown a fairly significant reduction in income. My last gig was just after Thanksgiving in 2015. The people who had booked me had paid a deposit in advance, so they went ahead and had me come out with my balloons and five foot cold cut with six toppings on  Italian herb bread.

There's a reason why he would call a random person he met out of the blue and tell them happy birthday on their birthday. That reason?  The man had a unbelievable faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. He was a pastor, and he was using the love of Jesus given to him by the Holy Spirit to spread that love and he did. People often claimed that he was the nicest person in the world and he was so nice he was hard to interview because he would genuinely want to know about the interviewer and ask them questions and ask their opinions. He was the nicest person because he allowed the love of Christ to shine in him.  He prayed every single day for hours and hours for his family and his fans and the world.
