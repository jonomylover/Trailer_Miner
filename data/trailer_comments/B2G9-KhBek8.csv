I really like the Big Short but this film style just feels so goofy and tonally not appropriate for the subject matter--if anything, it matches the Big Short better. Also that scene where Roger Ailes is about to assault Kayla, that weird crescendo totally lessens the impact of what's going on, and that Billie Ellish song doesn't feel like it's tonally apt for the subject matter. It just feels like a very goofy and comedic take on a very serious corporate culture that's been brewing for decades, along with all the other terribly insane things Ailes has been involved with. I just think this should be handled more gracefully and with more nuance, like Spotlight or Dark Waters or Zodiac are good examples of movies based on true stories dealing with sensitive and dark subject matters.
