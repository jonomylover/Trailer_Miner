I really hope it doesn't come to that, because it does look like a few of the jokes here may stick but may also get drowned out in the cringe references. 2. the plot really does feel done a lot. new star meets an old popular star and they form up and form a relationship. something happens, they break up and after an apology because someone was being irrational, they become friends again, one of those plots. i know there is a father-son relationship in there, and i really want that to have a lot of focus rather than on a really basic plot that can drag the movie down. and 3. does magic really have to be a factor in this movie. we already had movies like kubo and the two strings and mlp:EQ where the instruments are magic. in kubo's defense, they used that magic in a beautiful way that tied in well with the story, and in mlp's case, it's just a massive confusion. if you REALLY need magic in the movie, please have some explanation for it instead of ""Oh hey look, the character's magical because 'representation' and 'symbolism'"" or some crap like that, it really throws a movie off.  i see potential here, but i feel like you may want to put your focus on certain areas that may be overshadowed in the movie.",0,0,Iron Collie,UVwFM2PukSE,0.1721596921596922,2016-12-22 08:54:34,True,True
