The Gunslinger already lost my attention as the trailer looks like someone threw the first two books, a collection of the comics and an old Steven Seagal flick into a blender and hit pur√©e.

2017-07-15T22:54:16,"You have *GOT* to be kidding me. In the books, Charles Wallace is described to have *blond hair,* and *blue eyes.* This Charles Wallace does not match the description at all.  Neither does Mrs. Whatsit. I mean- sure- she's a fucking centaur thing when she's in her true form, but usually, she appears as an old lady who got her clothes at a garage sale. I don't mean that to be rude, but its true. In the books she is described to have a very mismatched exterior. Underneath all that she is described as everyone's favorite grandma. That may have not been said word for word in the books, but its close enough. I can't quite tell exactly who each Mrs. is, but at 0:58 I'll guess that Mrs. Whatsit is the middle one. She does not fucking look like a sweet old grandma. Albeit she does look regal, but that's not how Mrs. Whatsit was really described, out of her usual form.   Next, Mrs. Which. Now, I don't mind her design. She is the least material of the three in the books, but the most powerful. She is also the most distant from human reality, in the book, completely forgetting that human require 3 dimensions to live, and attempts to land them on a 2D planet. Her voice is represented through lots of douuble lletttterrrs, suggesting that her voice is like an echo. I can't truly find anything wrong with Mrs. Which, *YET.*  Now, Mrs. Who. She is the most unclear out of all of them. Partly because half of her words are not her own, she quotes writers and such. Her one major characteristic is her glasses, which can be viewed in the trailer. So really, nothing wrong with that.   I mainly envisioned the Mrs's as a bunch elderly women. I'm unused to seeing them as young women. I will be seeming when it comes out, but I will have extreme doubts.

And the stupid race change is NOT going to get black people to come and see the movie. The entire series is as whitey mcwhiterson as it can get--you can't just slap on some black skin and make it 'diverse'.  There are actual stories with actual black protagonists, why not make one of those if you want a movie with a black protagonist--we'd all actually like that instead of this endless shoehorning of fake diversity into stories that don't need it.   God damn it, Disney--you're making Black Panther---why can't we finally get African fantasy stories? Anansi tales? Stories with REAL black people in them--instead of this endless parade of white characters in blackface--because make no mistake--that's what this actually is. Hollywood is AFRAID of making fantasy or science fiction stories about REAL black people so they keep attaching them to random properties in the hope that one will take.

""A darkness spreading"" isn't very exciting or original.   And yeah, the girl from the book had like, red hair. It was actually an important setup for the plot. And also, yeah, the book is almost more about the brother, Charles Wallace, than about Meg (who though is important, isn't nearly as interesting as Charles). This is why the sequel, 'A Swiftly Tilting Planet', has Charles as the central protagonist, not Meg.  Look, I hope the movie is good, but this trailer isn't. I hope that people  who hate diversity won't be able to point to the diversity in this as to why the movie fails, but honestly, the casting choices here for these characters seem really, really off.

I have not seen any movie adaptation before, but I can also tell you that I'm glad that Disney is doing something that is, more or less, have not been adapted by them before, or adapted before by any company. Even though there was an adaptation made when I saw a trailer for it on the Spy Kids VHS, I have not seen it. Most, if not, almost all of Disney's slate for 2018 does not classify itself as a remake of one of their old animated films, and we're getting 3 of those in 2019. Mary Poppins Returns is a sequel I'm looking forward to. This movie has a more original flair than just being a remake, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, while dealing with the Nutcracker ballet, has not been dealt with extensively before by Disney other than in Fantasia, Wreck it Ralph 2, Ralph Breaks the Internet is an animated sequel to an animated film and not a remake of an animated film, and Magic Camp is essentially an original comedy. I guess my worry is Disney not making interesting movies anymore because I saw the Nostalgia Critic's video of ""When Should Remakes Not Happen"", and he argued that Disney's live action remake of Beauty and the Beast did so much of the exact same thing that's been done better in an animated cartoon made 26 years ago, and that doing the exact same thing is a good reason not to do a remake. He also argues that the new Planet of the Apes trilogy qualifies as good remakes because it takes a familiar story in a different direction. Simply put, I don't want to quit being a Disney fan even if Disney no longer makes interesting movies.",0,0,Jordan White,E4U3TeY2wtM,0.26271645021645024,2017-07-18 01:17:55,True,True

Race is irrelevant - the theme is love and faith penetrating through the smothering of conformity. Meg is every early teen wondering if they are special and if their life has meaning.  That's the story. Now the bad news: Disney has their hands on it. They have a stellar track record of taking the most beloved of stories and re-writing them to a point the original author could hardly recognize and certainly would not own. John Carter (aka A Princess of Mars) is an abomination I'll never get over.

Meg's physical characteristics are described as her with unruly mousy hair, glasses and braces.  But PLEASE, someone tell me which page is it on where Meg is described as a white girl?  I'd love to know.  The only thing that could remotely establish Meg's character as white is her last name being Murry (an Irish last name), but then the casting is spot on with hiring a bi-racial actress since Chris Pine (a white man) is playing the dad -- problem solved!  Besides that, if you're seriously not watching the movie because there's too many Black people or you feel it's not ""sticking"" to the book.  Don't see it.  It's very simple.  But I can tell you one thing ... I'm pretty sure there will be a LOT of movies in the future you will not be seeing.  This will NOT be the last movie with POC (People of Color) casted based on a book.  America is a melting pot and as much as the racists would like for Us to ""go away,"" unfortunately, we're not.

2017-07-23T04:37:33,"Some people (generally minorities) want to keep race in the discussion because racism affects their lives day in day out. Some other people (generally white) don't want to hear about it because they don't directly experience the pain of racism, so they don't feel it's a problem they caused or can resolve. In any case, pretty much everything in the USA is about race and it will continue to be until systemic racism in our society is addressed in a meaningful way. Also, anyone saying that it matters what race these characters are needs to get real. Damn near every character in Game of Thrones was changed in various ways from the books, but people still love the show. Why? Because race, ethnicity, physical features, etc don't make a character, unless those traits are a central theme in the story. Typically, in my opinion, it's the acting makes a character believable, so if you're suggesting that white people are somehow being cheated or diminished by not being portrayed in this movie, just get real. Yes, it's true that there is FINALLY an effort in Hollywood to diversify film rolls and that is a good thing, given how lily white the best roles have been until recently (with some notable exceptions). Point is, if you're white and are crying because film roles are getting more ethnically diverse, well, too bad. Your privilege needs checked. There is room in the film industry for far more diversity and if your delicate sensibilities can't handle that, it's your problem. People of color go to movies too and they deserve to see more of themselves reflected on screen, in some of the top roles. If you have a problem with this, you may be biased in your preferences and may not have the self awareness to realize it. If this is you, don't make your problem everyone else's problem. Instead, just fix your problem.",0,0,D LG,E4U3TeY2wtM,0.15309523809523806,2017-07-23 04:37:33,True,True

Basically made concept art and character designs for what an animated film of it might look like. Seeing this trailer during Coco felt like a dream come true so much that I legit cried tears of joy. For me the celebrity casting or diverse ethnicities I could give less of a fuck about (I don't know if they ever said what color the characters were besides from the front covers so I'm fine with it). What's important is how well they actually stick to the original story, character personalities, and settings. Don't understand why they changed Ms.Whatsit's centaur form though.

L'Engle may have been a YA fantasy writer, but she seemed to have lived in a very white world. Unspecified race means white in America, especially back then. The casting of Reid is odd - she looks mixed, but she's not the Rihanna-looking mixed that whites and others like so much - that's considered so attractive and cool. If Reid grew up and had some plastic surgery, then maybe she'd be more in line with what Euro-centric critics want to see.
