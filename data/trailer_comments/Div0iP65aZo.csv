Hugh is phenomenally talented he can captivate us as surly Wolverine in X-Men and also as the musically inclined Jean Valjean in Les Mis√©rables!

My gut reaction to this is to nitpick the idea that he's just totally fallen apart in eight years. I'm assuming they made it so soon so they could reasonably include Patrick Stewart. I'd rather they have skipped Stewart and made this take place in eighteen years. With even some advanced healing abilities lingering, I'd assume he'd be better off than what Im seeing. But then again, if the healing trailed off abruptly, just a couple of hand to hand fights would ruin him... It's worth noting the number of films I've made is zero.

I sincerely hope the next actor to play wolverine actually wears the costume and has a gruff voice.   Also, sir, the character you played in your movie Prisoners,  was and is infinitely more dangerous and powerful than the character of Logan. I was moved by your portrayal of the devoted father. You are incredible in that movie.   Perhaps there is no possible comparison but I'm choosing to compare your characters, anyway.

Become a shadow of myself Become a freak on the run And have I fallen so far And as the hour so late That nothing remains but the howl of my hate The howls in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years  If there's another way to go I missed it 100 long years ago My life was a war that could never be won They gave me a number and they murdered Logan When they chained me and filled me with lead Just for healing whenever I bled  Yet why did I allow a school To touch my soul and teach me love? They treated me like any other They gave me their trust They called me brother My life they claimed for mutant kind Can such things be For I had come to hate the world This world that always hated me  Take an eye with a claw! Rip your heart through your chest! This is all I have lived for! When does Logan get to rest!  One word from him and I'd be back On Stryker‚Äôs tables, on Stryker‚Äôs rack. Instead, he offers me redemption I feel my shame inside me like indestructible metal alloy fused to my skeletal structure  He told me that I have a soul, How does he know? Oh right, he can read my mind And also he has Cerebro  I‚Äôm grizzled, see my beard There‚Äôs another girl I must protect and I stare into the mirror Look at the scars all down my back I'll escape now from the world Since my healing is all gone Wolverine is nothing now Old man Logan must begin!",0,0,Benjamin Watts,Div0iP65aZo,-0.056307435254803674,2016-10-21 03:49:20,True,True

Not¬†to mention that¬†Hugh seems¬†to be a¬†cool guy himself; I really hope him leaving has nothing to do with the rumors about his health.¬†Also, as someone who grew up¬†with and loved¬†the X-Men Evolution TV series, getting to see one of its original characters (X23) have a major film appearance is awesome - the show always seemed to go under the radar so this is a nice nod as¬†a legacy for the show.  All it needs now is Liev Schreiber to return as Sabertooth. Yes, I know that Origins is considered to be a bad movie by most and is technically out of the continuity, but Liev played a great role for what he had to work with, and I'm sure they can still fit him in somehow.

People have been reported bad signal from T-Mobile so i dont think its them. Judging that the phone is possibly silver im going to assume it is with Verison. Verizon sold out real fast of the other colors. Also judging that they are in the woods and Verizon has the best 4G LTE coverage it would only make sense.

Don't get me wrong, the tone of the trailer was interesting and I think it can be good on its own, but it already seems to have ruined DoFP, the fantastic conclusion to the old cast's story. I haven't read Old Man Logan so if I'm missing something please let me know.  EDIT: I saw in some of the other comments that Cable will fix everything in Deadpool 2 or X-Force.

And this time on one hand it seems it's gonna be different, more subtle and dramatic (without cutting the action), but on the other hand they took the same film-maker they took for the last Wolverine, that had more of a commercial aim than the very bests like Batman or GOTG. And on one hand this song is absolutely amazing, but on the other hand taking this song for a trailer is CHEATING !

It adds a high flavour of realism to the movie.  Mutants being wiped out is also intriguing (biological contagious ""weapon""??). Maybe Wolverine survived as he is the only mutant whose cells can heal quickly?  But still, we see Professor Xavier who is also a mutant (btw excellent concept to see him alongside with Wolverine) that offsets the theory that X Men were wiped out by a sort of biological weapon targeting mutant genes.  Anyway, Logan movie is very promising and from what we saw from the trailers, is far better than the two previous ones. The story reminds me of one of the first X Men movies where he just wants to stand alone by himself and does not care nor believe much about Xavier's school but then get softened and feel forced somehow to help a young girl. Here, the end magically matches the begin and here, he is a 100 times stronger even if he has been somehow weakened by something but he fights with his strongest skill... : his guts and it is just what Wolverine is about before any mutant power.

I also felt that the movie dragged on a tad too much particularly during the second act. Dafne Keen was a REVELATION as X-23, literally a perfect casting imo. Leon the Professional is an old favourite of mine, but I feel that, for her age, Dafne Keen exudes more gravitas than Natalie Portman did at a similar age.

Probably one of my favorite superheroes. This movie was really good. It's different than typical superhero movies and it doesn't even feel much like one. It's more raw, more deep, more painfully truthful. The portrayal of Logan really is something. He's such a brutal and conflicted character, and it's definitely shown. It's quite sad and dark, but that's what makes it memorable. Absolutely would not recommend for kids, but that makes sense, what with the R rating. I think it's a good thing they decided to go the extra step by adding the violence and language and make it have that rating, because they were able to show a more truthful and realistic depiction of what Logan is really like. It brought out that roguish, animal, angry, brutish, human realism of what he is. And that is when you know you have a great film: the actors and writers and directors and EVERYONE involved are able to make a believable and pure character.",410,7,Val,Div0iP65aZo,0.20440323565323565,2017-04-24 21:42:54,False,True

2017-10-28T06:43:36,"Just seen the movie for the first time, and it just moved Wolverine up from being my #2 favorite superhero of all time to co #1 alongside Batman. This man has been through so much throughout his life, and has lost everyone he's ever loved. But under that rugged and pissed off demeanor lies a heart of gold. He gave his last to save a bunch of kids and his daughter of only a week. That is what a true superhero is. As far as the movie, it is perhaps both the goriest and most emotional superhero movie I've ever seen. Which makes it the perfect Wolverine movie. I don't think there's ever been an actor more fit to play a superhero role than Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. He IS Wolverine. And I hope his years of hard work and dedication to the role pays off with Logan in the form of at least an Oscar nom. In fact, I got serious Leo DiCaprio in Revenant vibes from Jackman here.

You can tell that a great deal of effort and ambition was put into the making of Logan. The attention to detail, the cinematography, the sound, the score, the script, and the performances were all beautifully executed. Hugh Jackman gave what may as well be his greatest performance of his career. I loved every minute of him on screen, as well as Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen. Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant, and all of the supporting actors were also phenomenal. The story was beautiful. This trailer alone! Hurt by Johnny Cash was a perfect fit and for the tone of the movie. I didn't know about the song until I saw the trailer.. and mannnn am I glad I didn't know! I now identify Hurt with Logan. I was overwhelmingly obsessed with it after I first saw it. This is a great trailer for a great movie. Respect to James Mangold and the producers!

Logan's intricacy baffles me in this today's culture of passable big-budget entertainment. In 2008, audiences were at least primed to the possibility of The Dark Knight becoming a masterpiece because it followed the release of Batman Begins and was directed by the great Christopher Nolan.
