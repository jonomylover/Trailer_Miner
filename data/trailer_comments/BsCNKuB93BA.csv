2019-08-23T18:34:25,"I have a feeling that Tommy Lee Jones will be advertised as the film's villain, but it will be a marketing ploy, in order to hide the role of the true main antagonist, Donald Sutherland. Most movie villains these days are surprise villains, with their roles as villains being hidden until the film's release. They did it with Koba in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Ego in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Mysterio in Spider-Man: Far From Home, and many more.  I don't know for definite, but I think there's a possibility that Tommy Lee Jones will be the advertised antagonist to hide Donald Sutherland's role as the true main antagonist. It's possible. He played a great villain as President Snow in The Hunger Games movies, and he has a menacing presence that he brings to a lot of his roles.",0,0,Aran Donnelly,BsCNKuB93BA,0.17435897435897435,2019-08-23 18:34:25,True,True

It takes you on this journey as if you were there and makes you feel that you actually experienced it, now that is great film making.
