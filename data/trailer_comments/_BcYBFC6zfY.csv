Despite an abundance of product placement and self-promotion, there does seem to be some creativity and effort put into how the internet is depicted (but is it just me, or has The Emoji Movie tainted this concept a little?). I just hope it has at least one reference to Tron, and perhaps a cameo from Jack Sparrow.    What bothers me though is some of the self-parodying that the princesses do. Sure, they do reference the most stereotypical themes associated with themselves, and feel cleverly used as Jonas Brothers-esque performers, but other than that it feels a bit disrespectful. Not as much to the characters as to the people who in the earlier days of Disney helped create them. Snow White, for instance, is a character that has admittedly aged, but from a seniority point of view, she should feel a bit more dignified. She was the very first Disney princess after all, in the first feature-length animated movie ever. And as much as I enjoy that Disney are willing to make fun of themselves, didn't they already do that with Enchanted? Also, do they really need to hammer the point of feminism in when they already have characters like Elsa, Mulan and Belle present?   I also have a fear that Wreck-it Ralph 2, like a lot of movies right now, will lean too heavily on nostalgia in order to sell itself to an audience. Admittedly it did the same with videogame characters in the first one, but the references it made fit the mold of the story and didn't distract from our main characters. Because Ralph and Vanellope seems to be out of their element for most of the movie, the risk of the movie feeling like a huge sidetrack might be higher.  Though I'm not gonna jump the gun yet and say that this will be stupid, cause I do like some of the stuff I've seen here. The Disney-princesses look pretty good in this format, and some of their other characteristics are cleverly used, like how Pocahontas hair appears to have a constant breeze in it, or that Cinderella uses her glass slipper like a broken bottle.",0,1,Jonathan Larsson,_BcYBFC6zfY,0.12900579150579153,2018-06-04 17:59:59,True,True

Like finding Dory for example, yeah it was a fun movie but in the end she found her parents cause nobody dies in that long period of time!!! Why couldn't Dory learn that her old family is gone and move on to her new Family Darwin and Nemo?   You could argue that ""because she has short-term memory loss"" that was used as a gag in first one and is very infrequent though out the hole finding Dory!   My point is if her parents had died it would teach the kids very important life lesson that (things from the past may not be there in the future) yeah but Ig they could not put a important life lesson in a (Disney movie)...  I sound like I hated finding Dory which is not true, it was a fun return to the world but in the end that's all it was...

The reason is because these 2 films are not well known, but then again, they have a cult following.

I guess I could see it in theaters and have a fun time seeing it. This movie might even be one of my favs. Though I really do hope that they only feature the Disney Princesses in one scene and not for the entire movie, otherwise it overhype its audience even further.

2018-06-04T23:16:44,"I know this is going to sound ridiculous but in a the scene Elsa asks Penelope if she has magic hands and out of nowhere they assumed that she is non straight for some reason I mean people are messed up these days they were also pushing Disney to give Elsa a girl love interest just to represent them but that's not happening because you can't fix something that isn't broken and I'm gonna say a few stuff to clear things up just so you can understand Elsa wasn't actually uninterested in men because the only reason she was uncomfortable is because of her powers if they found out they would have freaked because they just don't get her, she said that she will only open the gate for one day and that's it and she wouldn't actually have time to look for love or marry someone into the throne, also she never shown interest in woman (but she did show interest in a man in the comics called Elsa dance lesson and it proofs that she never rejected man) and she away in the mountains sang the song just to be free from her fear and never mind what people think, that's something that everyone relates to, the first already tackled the issue of being different from everyone, the plot for frozen 2 first of all wouldn't feature any romance because that does sound  boring even as a side plot, the biggest plot would actually explain the origins of Elsa's powers and the social issue would be about ""parent issues"", ""don't pretend to be like someone and dont refuse to tell them who you really are even if your afraid they won't except you"", ""adoption issues and finding where you truly belong and never think that your a nobody"", understand that adopted or not you're still part of the family"", instead of a parent not excepting who you are they should instead experience it and see what good comes from it"", Parents excepting there child for who they are and never reject them if they don't grow up the way you want them."" These are the most likely issues that Chris buck and Jennifer Lee would be tackling for the sequel. There will never be a same sex plot for this one because they already have the ideas planed out and they would make some changes to the plot but not change the plot to please the social media and besides Elsa is already excepted by her kingdom so she wasn't struggling with anything Elsa and one more thing she actually is interested in men and like I said the comic called Elsa dance lesson proofs it, that's all I have to say, thank you. And people say that when they give Elsa a male love interest they say it will go against everything we thought of the first film but when they say it's a woman they said it wouldn't take away her independent role but it's not true either and let me explain what else I've heard from the comments and I've really learned a lot of things people tries to shoehorn stuff in the sequel like that it's pointless and even if it's ritten well it would still be on the fans who pushed them to do it, when she never confirmed her sexuality it doesn't mean make it different because she was focused on trying to keep her power under control and those vibes that you got from her when she sings that song sometimes vibes aren't enough proof, and we shouldn't even been talking about this in the first place it doesn't matter what you say about Elsa like it will help kids feel excepting of themselves or save life's which to you it's good but at the same time it would cause lots of problems for people including the ones from your community even they think it's offensive, just because she is single doesn't mean she is not interested in dude's pluse the song writer's were asked if that represents a coming out story and they said that it's something that all community's relate to, not just one group and like it or not write thing to do or not it won't happen either way because the directors had their own ideas for the sequel and when Jennifer Lee was asked about that rumor in the interview you can see that she was avoiding the question and said that we'll see were we go and she will only follow what makes sense for the character and never put her in a position that could compromise the franchise that the whole world fell in love with and when hans said that ""no one is getting anywhere with her"" he thought that the men were trying to marry her into the throne which isn't the case because she never was looking for anyone and if you want to have a storyline that represents true difference then wait for a movie that you never asked for and you will have what you need so you cant mess with an already established character all the comics and shorts and not one scene says she's non straight glaad was also trying to make marvel turn captain America bi when he never had interest in men and Finn and Poe getting together is impossible because Finn wasn't meant to be bisexual and Poe has already given up on him, as for Elsa she never was non straight when the comic called Elsa dance lesson proofs it when she was skating with a prince the point it Elsa having a love interest boy or girl is not going to work or happen and besides Chris buck said that she would never get a love interest at all now do you see my point if not than don't comment if yes than comment it's that simple.",1,2,Adam Stephens,_BcYBFC6zfY,0.08358058608058608,2018-06-04 23:16:44,True,True

2018-06-04T23:23:59,"*HERE'S THE TRUTH:* Romans 10:9-10: That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  This means it's easy to get saved and gain eternal life. It's a matter of confession and belief. You must confess that God's Son, Jesus Christ, is Lord, and believe He died for your sins and God rose him from the dead.  Once you believe, all it takes is a simple prayer. Maybe something like this:  ""Lord Jesus, please save me, and give me eternal life. Amen.""  If you prayed that prayer sincerely, and you believe that God's Son Jesus died for your sins and that God rose him from the dead, you have eternal life... and you can never lose it! It's not about what we do, it's about what He did for us.  Ephesians 2:8-9: For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  John 5:24: Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  John 6:37: All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.   Now, once you believe, you become a child of God. You'll never see hell (even though our actions rightfully disqualify us from Heaven, once you believe, you accept the gift of eternal life and your sins are payed for, therefore you'll never go to hell). But, you can be an obedient or disobedient child. If you live a good life, you'll be blessed on the Earth, but if you live badly, God will chasten and punish you on the Earth. Even so, you will still go to Heaven.  Also, Jesus is the ONLY WAY to Heaven. If there were another way, He wouldn't have had to die for you and everyone.  John 14:6: Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Now, if you doubt the Bible, feel free to reply. The prophecies about Israel alone prove The Bible. If you want to hear about them, reply below and I will reply back.",4,0,Jesus Died For You,_BcYBFC6zfY,0.1297682709447415,2018-06-04 23:23:59,True,True

I hate to say it but she looks...whiter. Unlike her cartoon counterpart. -Belle, Ariel and Tiana I guess are fine. Didn't see much of Ariel. Belle's works the best out of them all. - It does work with Aurora (sleeping beauty is underrated) and Mulan. Really Aurora is the best transitioned out of all of them. - Also Rapunzel talking like that seems out of character for her. I know all were about to kill her there but still.  -Wasn't the chameleon from Tangled on Belle's shoulder when we first see her? - I get Snow White is known for her voice but it seems her last bit was a reference to the singing thanos meme to me.

Aurora for an example. She would be asleep forever if her prince did not fight Maleficent and give her loves true kiss. Anna would have frozen in the forest (or died from wolves) if it weren't for Christof taking her to Elsa on his sleigh. And Elsa would have been stabbed by Hans if it weren't for Anna and Anna was only there because Christof drove? (I don't know if this is the proper word.) her back to Arendelle on Sven after she got shot in the heart by ice. Ariel's prince crush (forgot his name) stabbed Ursula in the stomach with a ship and killed her.   I don't like how they said how people assume all of their problems were solved when a guy came along because that isn't true. Some (emphasize on some) of the princesses wouldn't have had a happy ending if it weren't for a guy.  But some had happy endings with no men involved. (Merida for an obvious answer.)

2018-06-05T01:57:03,"Some people may argue against the comment Rapunzel makes but she is correct. It is a bit of a misconception for the most part in regards to the Disney Princess movies.   When you analyze the films more, at most I would say Aurora, Jasmine, and kind of Snow White had their problems solved from a male. To be fair to Snow White, she is about 14, and her problems were solved with the help of multiple male adults, such as the hunter, the dwarves, then finally the prince.  Oh, and Ariel too I suppose since Prince Eric defeats Ursula in the end although her problems weren't ""solved"" until her father granted her legs.   Cinderella's problems were solved due to a fairy Godmother and deciding to rebel, and then coincidentally falling in love.  Tiana and Rapunzel were a strange set of partnered circumstances that were originally mutual agreements between both parties that are helping each other and then a conflict with Dr. Facilier and Mother Gothel. Pocahontas actually gained problems due to John and the other colonists searching for gold. And we certainly can't include Mulan, Merrida, Anna, Elsa, or Alice in not solving their problems.  Moana had some prophecy stuff to get Maui and mostly saves the day herself.   It's kind of strange that Disney has this reputation in regards to their Princess films as they really aren't like that at all for the most part. Perhaps due to marketing, toys, etc and particularly from past Disney which was founded in the 20s but not the actual movies.

For me, it just made it harder to read or write. I started working really hard on how to read better. My family helped me by making me read everything from menus, to cereal boxes, to road signs.

Especially the classic ones, Snow white, Cinderella, Aurora, it's very out of character for them. But instead of having the more feisty/worrier princesses stand at the ready  and the more gentile and meek ones hide they just made them all jump up.  All of these charterers are established and the original ones were very sincere and now they make them all porridge. Now they've made them milk toast just blandly strong, knowing, and independent Which takes away the uniqueness of the ones who were always like that.  Let's not forget that the men who saved them (if you really want to take it that literally)  are all very good and great men. For goodness sake Aurora's ""Big strong man"" slayed a dragon and woke her from eternal sleep.  You'd have to be a little thick to take fairy tails literally but they will. But even if you do that, how can you possibly think that ""a big strong man"" is a bad thing? As if having a good, strong, brave man around would be a bad or demeaning thing. Or that being so good, kind, hard working, pure, and loving that you inspire someone to take up arms and defend you when you're too weak to do anything ( because of the multiple assassination attempts) is wrong.  O.K. I'm starting to cool down and I know I shouldn't condemn a move based on a 2 minuet  trailer. I know that is kind of what I'm doing.  For those of you how made it through the dark times that were the Cinderella straight to DVD sequels you will understand why I'm so defensive.  It hurts when you see the characters you love and grew up with changed to fit with the agenda of the month attitude. I've seen this happen to those who love star wars  and saw the prequels and were hurt and now the new ones, oi va. I actually don't know about Star Wars that's just what I've been seeing. Which Disney also owns now... hmm.  Wow I didn't think my comment would get this long.  I guess this isn't really about Wreck-It Ralph more on the whole princess zeitgeist as is stands. I hope this was just an overreaction by me and the move is good but I'm weary of sequels.

Seriously, you never see Mulan stop in the middle of the story to make a speech about being a strong woman while slipping in a line about Disney's new movies. I look at this trailer and I don't see a team of passionate writers, I see fifty people in business suits deciding where to slip in the next star wars reference and then deciding not to subtlety slip it in but have Ralph scream ""I Love Star Wars Because It Has Strong Female Characters.""

I‚Äôm not roasting film/game theory but sometimes rather than acting like you are hiding what you know until the end of the video to create some suspense, it‚Äôs better to lay out the differences between the two while still explaining why it IS ‚Äúokay‚Äù. Sorry, I‚Äôve just noticed this is how a lot of his theories go. In my mind he should start doing diet theories again. It‚Äôs a great way to bring up a fun/controversial topic and quickly  process through the theorizing gears. He only did one of these (As far as I know but am pretty sure) and it helped to crunch a reasonable theory into a short amount of time.

2018-06-05T05:11:53,"Bee Movie Script        According to all known laws of aviation,     there is no way a bee should be able to fly.     Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.     The bee, of course, flies anyway     because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.     Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.     Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.     Barry! Breakfast is ready!     Ooming!     Hang on a second.     Hello?     - Barry? - Adam?     - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.     Looking sharp.     Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.     Sorry. I'm excited.     Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.     A perfect report card, all B's.     Very proud.     Ma! I got a thing going here.     - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!     - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!     Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!     - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.     - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.     Never thought I'd make it.     Three days grade school, three days high school.     Those were awkward.     Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.     You did come back different.     - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.     - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.     - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.     Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.     Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.     I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.     I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.     That's why we don't need vacations.     Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.     - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!     - Bee-men. - Amen!     Hallelujah!     Students, faculty, distinguished bees,     please welcome Dean Buzzwell.     Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...     ...9:15.     That concludes our ceremonies.     And begins your career at Honex Industries!     Will we pick ourjob today?     I heard it's just orientation.     Heads up! Here we go.     Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.     - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.     What's the difference?     You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you'll just work us to death?     We'll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that?     One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.     I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We're bees.     We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I've never seen them this close.     They know what it's like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don't come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!     - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.     Their day's not planned.     Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.     You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.     Right.     Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.     It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.     Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.     Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?     Distant. Distant.     Look at these two.     - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.     It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.     Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!     He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!     - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.     What were you doing during this?     Trying to alert the authorities.     I can autograph that.     A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?     Yeah. Gusty.     We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.     - Six miles, huh? - Barry!     A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.     - Maybe I am. - You are not!     We're going 0900 at J-Gate.     What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?     I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.     Hey, Honex!     Dad, you surprised me.     You decide what you're interested in?     - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.     Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?     Son, let me tell you about stirring.     You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.     You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.     You know, Dad, the more I think about it,     maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.     You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?     That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.     Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!     - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.     You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!     - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!     Wait till you see the sticks I have.     I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!     Let's open some honey and celebrate!     Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.     Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!     I'm so proud.     - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.     Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.     Yeah, right.

2018-06-05T09:51:56,"People are saying that this film is just seems it's gonna 'end up like the emoji movie'. This is just my opinion on the matter. Let's look at the facts:  This is a Disney Animation film, which hopefully means it won't need too much advertising, since Disney don't need it. Sure it has things like twitter, amazon and google shown on it. But that's because it's the internet. Those are 3 of the biggest names on it, of course they are gonna be featured. It wouldn't be the internet without it. Also the search bar guy could have easily been Google. The other companies were only shown for a second maybe two each. The biggest advertisement was for Disney and other companies it owns. The emoji movie was also a film based off emoji's, a really dumb concept when you think about. I haven't watched it because I've never wanted to but I know enough about it that it doesn't make sense. (Is their a thing as a 'just dance' app?)  This is a sequel to a successful film that will expand the world for characters people already know and like. Plus it's the same director and one of the same writers as the first one, so they should know what they are doing.  Other opinions:  Sure they advertised other companies Disney owns. But this is the sequel to a film which had several game characters from different franchises on the same screen. Of course they are gonna do the same thing again with stuff Disney owns. It's it character for what they did in the first one. Honestly, I find it great that they did. Seeing a X-Wing, Iron Man, EVE and Kermit on the same screen was something I never saw coming.  I knew from a news thing awhile back that they were gonna do the princess thing so I'm not shocked they put it in the trailer. But honestly, I find how they did it hilarious. And I like the fact that they got the princesses respective actresses to reprise their roles (except ones who have passed away). I'm pretty sure it's gonna be for that one scene though.  When I first saw the title for this film, I thought it was gonna be a bit weird. But now, I think this is gonna be a really good film and I'm really excited about watching it.",2,2,CoolWizard22,_BcYBFC6zfY,0.16759259259259263,2018-06-05 09:51:56,True,True

Wreck it Ralph was such a good movie because it was a story of trying to fit in, while adding references to 80s pop culture. This movie just seems to be attempting to market Disney and to fit as many references to pop culture as it can into the movie. The reasons I feel this movie will be bad are  1.  From this trailer, this movie will most likely have a shallow plot wit the basis of saving the internet.   2.  It will most likely not have any character development considering we got all the development that was possible between Ralp and Candy girl  3. The amount of pop culture references of today's society basically just sjows this movie is going to pander to Kids and is going to have jokes that just fall flat.  The 1st movie was so good because we got to see such good development between all the characters in the movie. The movie also ended on a satisfying note with Ralph and candy girl becoming happy with their lives. There was really no point in making a second movie and its obvious that this movie was made just to cash out on the popularity of the 1st one.",98,17,Darrel williams,_BcYBFC6zfY,0.27166666666666667,2018-06-05 10:14:02,True,True

2018-06-05T12:38:25,"This seriously looks brilliant. I love the trailer, although I have to point out that this is yet another Disney movie that somehow forgets to include Megara in the Princess line up - well, she's married to a demigod instead of a Prince - but come on! Hercules is one of the best Disney films ever made; it has the best villain, incredible songs from Alan Menkin and Megara, the first, truly independent female role. She comes from nothing, sells her soul to the devil to save her boyfriend's (Achilles) life, who then cheats on her and still she manages to pull her life together. Surely that should be a good enough reason to include more of her? I know, I know, Hercules wasn't as popular as all the other films the Princesses shown in Ralph 2 were and there would be a real uproar if Elsa was without Anna (or would there be?), but these Princesses get all the screen time in all the movies and wouldn't it be great to bring some of the others in from time-to-time? Like Kida from Atlantis who is definitely a Princess (another amazing film) or Esmeralda from Hunchback who is definitely not a Princess but comes from a film which has the most breathtaking score. And wouldn't it be great to introduce these characters to a new generation who will then go back and watch the films and realise how amazing they are? Frozen was and still is the most successful and popular Disney film of all time, but that doesn't make it the best Disney film of all time. You put it alongside Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin or Hercules - it still stands up as one of the greats, but not the greatest. Of course you need to keep bringing Elsa and Anna into the mix as they are still relevant, but you're Disney. If you can make an arcade game from almost 40 years ago relevant again, surely you can do the same for some of your ""forgotten"" Princesses? I know I'm rambling and probably sounding like a proper geek, but I'm proud of being a geek and a huge Disney fanboy. I may be in my 30s now, but Disney appeals to all ages and let's us all know that it's ok to appease our inner child. There are 56 animated Disney movies with most having either a Princess or a strong female lead. As we are all born at different times, we all have our favourites and it would be great if they could all seen again, from time to time.",1,1,Simulated Created,_BcYBFC6zfY,0.4154013539651838,2018-06-05 12:38:25,True,True

2018-06-05T12:52:01,"I feel like we gradually see the true plot of the movie in the trailer; it's about them discovering the internet, and then they end up making a movie with Disney which is probably supposed to be a documentary about foreign game characters discovering their internet-land; but the movie-makers of the Disney studio we see in the movie probably wants it to be another generic Disney-princess movie about Ralph saving Vanelope, because as we see in the movie, that's what sells; something I assume Ralph and Vanelope disagree with because it's against their true nature. I think we'll see the movie make fun of the internet, but at the same time go into deeper conflicts in the movie-industry.

This sort of outlook on Disney films isn't exactly a new thing guys, so chill out. If anything, this is Disney poking fun at themselves, which (to me at least) is perfectly fine.  Also, people have been comparing it to The Emoji Movie, and yes, the concepts are similar, but really, the closest thing to ""Good"" that came out of that train-wreck was the idea of exploring the Internet and social media in the modern era, and since the aforementioned train-wreck misused that potential, I'd say that a second round from a much more competent company is at least worth a shot.

2018-06-05T17:31:25,"Hello! I am the creator and author of a new comic series called Space Junkies. I have designed this series to not only be entertaining for children, but to also reflect real struggles and real solutions to problems. Space Junkies demonstrates that the universe is chaotic and that the problems of greed, power, survival and other shortcomings exist, but can be overcome. Of course, such ideas are presented in a comical manner using characters that appeal to those that are both young of age and heart.   I personally believe we can influence future outcomes through those things we can imagine. That being said, let me know your thoughts on the latest Space Junkies Animatic Trailer.

The literal definition of ‚Äúfeminism ‚Äù is ‚Äúthe advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes‚Äù Meaning basically wanting equal rights between both genders. Rapunzel says something like ‚ÄúDid a big strong man save you and everyone thought it solved all your problems‚Äù Which is poking fun at old Disney movies in which is what literally happens.

2018-06-06T06:44:00,"1:55 This doesn't make any sense. The only time I've ever heard people assume that all the princess' problems were solved by a man was when they actually were like in the case of both Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. If it weren't for the men showing up they would be dead. The other cases are as follows:  Cinderella: Her Fairy Godmother and a bunch of animals solved her problems. Beauty and the Beat: Big strong man caused the problem and everyone acknowledges this  Aladdin: The movie wasn't about Jasmine, but really the Genie solved everyone's issues Pocahontas: I don't actually know since whenever anyone talks about it its about how horribly inaccurate and bad the movie is  The Little Mermaid: Ursula would have killed Ariel if Eric handed rammed a boat into her. Triton gives her legs to be with Eric. I don't actually think she solves a single one of her problems with her own power. Mulan: Mulan's the hero and no one is going to contest that Brave: Literally all about that not being the case Princess and the Frog: Never saw it and nobody ever talks about it so I don't know (honestly it feels like people forgot it existed) Tangled: Rapunzel saved herself with some assistance from Flynn Frozen: The same as Beauty and the Beast Moana: Moana saved the day, Maui helped Wreck-it-Ralph: If Ralph hadn't fixed Venellope's code she would be dead (The scene in the new movie makes her look like an ingrate)  Taking all of this into account, the joke takes on a whole different meaning than the one I think is intended. I think the joke is just supposed to be that princesses aren't given enough credit and are constantly being overshadowed, but honestly what I get from the joke is that the princesses are just being self-deprecating. It's kind of sad thinking that these character think that they're not given the credit they deserve, but it's also really strange given that they are wildly more popular than the men in their stories. (I don't remember the names of either of the princes from Snow White or Sleeping Beauty at all)  A side note: Why is Mulan with the princesses? She's not a princess. And where's Kida from Atlantis? She actually was a princess, but she's not included? Oh wait, that's right, that movie wasn't popular enough...",0,1,Introspectre,_BcYBFC6zfY,0.08166169416169416,2018-06-06 06:44:00,True,True

2018-06-06T10:53:57,"frankly i feel the ""big strong man"" joke is kinda funny, but isn't exactly warranted. i can sort of understand where it comes from, but when you actually think about it, only a few of those Disney Princesses are even in a scenario where you could argue ""big strong man came in to solve all the damsel's problems"". -Jasmine didn't have any serious problems that weren't actually caused by alladin(if the genie never showed up everything would have been business as usual with no schemes plots or giant hour-glasses) -Rapunzel worked just as hard as Eugene (and the horse) to solve her problems, so it's kind of silly to say that about her story -Elsa and Anna should be an obvious no. The main male characters were 1: an antagonist and 2: just sort of along for the ride -I can hardly remember the little mermaid or pocahontas, but as far as i can gather, neither ariel nor pocahontas would have even had any problems to solve if their love interest didn't exist.  -Merida is a no because that's kind of the entire point of Brave as a movie.. -I never watched the princess and the frog movie, but i think she turns into a frog, which seems like the opposite of solving problems, to me. also, it's a frog, not a big strong man. i think -No clue about Moana, still haven't gotten around to seeing it -Belle's only problem before the movie began was Gaston, and i don't think the beast did belle any favors tbh. unless you count stockholm syndrome as a plus? -You can make this argument for snow white and (the original) sleeping beauty, because they were basically in comas until their future love interest kissed em awake -and you can also make the argument for cinderella, but while it's true her prince searched for her and found her and whisked her away from practical slavery at the hands of her stepmother, you also need to consider that none of it could have been possible without cinderella having the courage and gall to actually go to the ball in the first place   honestly the bigger meta joke to take away from most of these disney movies is that magic does absolutely nothing but ruin these girls' lives....  anybody disagree, or?",0,0,NerdOracle,_BcYBFC6zfY,0.13459302325581393,2018-06-06 10:53:57,True,True

2018-06-06T15:07:47,"Guys... have you noticed how wicked and dire the world is becoming as of late?  Take a moment and consider the state of our world:   -The Middle East is at the tipping point.   -The world hates Israel.   -There is a growing demand for a one world economic, political, and religious system.   -There are wars and rumors of war (especially in regards to World War 3).   -Racism is some of the worst it's ever been.   -Hatred and madness is spilling over into riots in the streets.   -Perversion is running rampant.   -The weather is out of control.   -We're mutilating unborn children and mistakenly believing we have a ""right"" to do so.   -Education is in the toilet.   -Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are happening in more and more diverse places at a highly alarming rate.  ... You getting the picture? Something is deeply wrong with our world.  None of what you see going on in the world is normal or good. In fact, much of what you see happening around the globe coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says many of these things would occur before Christ returns. You can investigate it for yourself. The Bible says in the last days there will be: wars and rumors of war; a one world economic/governmental/religious system; Kingdoms against kingdoms and the seas and people raging; Violence and perversion on a grand scale; Earthquakes in diverse places, etc.  ... Sounds *exactly* like our world today, doesn't it? If that weren't enough to chew on, consider this: The Books of John and Acts combined total up to over 120+ historically verified facts. When you consider that, it gets a little difficult to write the Bible off as fairy tales when history and archaeology are on its side...  *Are you paying attention yet?* God is *screaming* at us! He warned us thousands of years in advance that all of what you are seeing would happen- and it is! It's all coming together to the letter! In fact, if you doubt the validity of Bible Prophecy, I encourage you to consider this: the Bible warns that in the last days that Damascus will become ""a ruinous heap."" It will become a no man's land inhabited by no one. Use that as a litmus test of sorts. Keep an eye on Damascus. If it never falls then feel free to throw out the Bible. But when Damascus does fall in the not too distant future... You'll see God is no liar. God also declares that the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus as your Savior. Good deeds won't get you there nor do good deeds erase a bad deed. If you murder somebody, that person is still dead even if you do nothing but good deeds after murdering them. You need a Savior who will forgive you of that murder because you can't save yourself.  Yet, many people will still discount God and His goodness even when shown evidence that the Bible is valid and coming true. A lot of people have difficulty believing in God because of all the evils in the world. However, this discounting of the only Person who can save you may be less of an inborn frustration or complaint and more of a hidden longing, placed there by the very One who planted His own image into the body and soul of every person He created. Where does this deep-seated intuition that suffering and pain are not right come from if we're just amalgamations of atoms, as the atheists say‚Ä¶?  What if, perhaps, this intuition points to something deeper? Something built into ourselves that reflects our true nature and identity? What if this revulsion against suffering and pain is a reminder of paradise, on one hand, and an anticipation of New Jerusalem on the other?  Perhaps it's the cry of the human spirit for God. For our Creator. The only One who can, and will, fix this mess.  As I've said, time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, ""You're just being paranoid like all the other fundamentalists. Haven't we always had these types of problems?"" Sure... But never at this magnitude or frequency! Check the news for yourselves. The amount of earthquakes, bloodshed, madness and horrific weather events are off the charts! Don't be deceived into thinking it's not as bad as it seems out there. The devil wants you to stay anemic and apathetic. Don't let that jerk deceive you. Or win your soul. Satan wants nothing more than for you to roll your eyes, scoff under your breath and put this whole ""God"" business under the rug. He wants you to continue believing that Hell and God and the afterlife is nonsense. That the Bible is all fairy tale nonsense of Jesus riding dinosaurs; that it's stuff only the weak-minded, brainwashed people believe. He'll gladly coax your pride, making you believe you're far too ""reasoned"" to believe in such things. However, Satan believes the Bible. Every jot and word of it. He doesn't see it as fairy-tale nonsense since it details his coming destruction. He just doesn't want YOU to believe it so he can drag your soul down with him when it's time for him to go!  Don't let him drag you down into the grave with him. Don't be played! Hell is a very real place-- a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. A-L-O-N-E. In the dark. Miserable for all eternity. If hell wasn't real, what on earth was Jesus willing to die for to protect us from...? Bill Nye thinks hell won't be so bad; he claims he's willing to hold onto his darwinian beliefs even if it means he's hellbound for it. I hope you won't share in that kind of disillusioned thinking...  Before you're sent to hell, you'll appear at the Great White Throne Judgment. Whether you believe in hell or not makes no difference--that giant throne you want to avoid seeing at all costs will be your destiny if Christ isn't your Savior. At the Great White Throne Judgment the books are thrown wide open and the past is recalled. Details and sins long forgotten or covered up are brought to light. Plenty of people will have a list of good deeds: acts of charity, love, and sacrifice. All their good deeds will be carefully considered... but none of them will be good enough to gain them admittance into heaven. The good deeds they did will have an impact on where they end up in the lake of fire, however. Hell will not be the same for everyone, but it will still be eternal misery... misery you could have easily avoided.  Sinners will wish they had done just a little less evil so their punishment could be a little more tolerable. Pornographers will wish they hadn't made so many videos. Control freaks will wish they hadn't been so angry and abusive. The internet troll will wish he hadn't cursed and slung so many demeaning insults toward a stranger online. And the abortionist will wish they hadn't killed any pre-born infants. All sins will be exposed. There's no way out... unless...  Unless you accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you're a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His free gift of salvation and grace. It's all yours... free for the taking! Jesus is the only way to get out of what's coming soon upon this world. I know you've probably heard ""Jesus loves you"" a million times in your life, and it probably sounds like an empty mantra by now... but it really is the truth! Do you know why you exist? Have you ever stopped and pondered about that...? Nothing in this life comes to be without God's approval first. That means that God thought¬† you were so worth the effort that He created you!  Or maybe you're wondering, ""How do I know that only Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or what about Hinduism or Buddhism? How do I know that the Bible isn't a book of fiction and myths? In fact, what about all the starving kids in Africa? If God is so ""just and loving,"" explain that one!"" These are incredibly valid questions that deserve real answers. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with?  If you have deep questions related to God, or if you're just remotely curious about Him... I encourage you to search out these authors. I'll even list some of their books that address just about any issue or question you could have about God:  Frank Turek- ""Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case""  Andreas Kostenberger- ""Truth Matters""  Louis Markos- ""Apologetics for the 21st Century""  Norman L. Geisler- ""When Skeptics Ask,"" ""I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist""  C.S. Lewis- ""Mere Christianity""  Lee Strobel- ""The Case For Christ,"" ""The Case For A Creator,"" ""The Case For Grace""  Ravi Zacharias- ""The End of Reason,"" ""Jesus Among Other Gods,"" ""Can Man Live Without God?"" ""Why Suffering?""  Philip Yancey- ""Reaching For The Invisible God,"" ""Disappointment With God""  Also, the ""One Minute Apologist"" right here on YouTube offers quick videos that tackle tough questions about God.  **  Why am I telling you all this? Especially when this has absolutely nothing to do with the video you're watching? Simple: to warn you. To offer you a life line. Deep down, if you have discernment and common sense, you can tell something is dreadfully wrong with this world and something in your heart is telling you to get right with God before it's too late. Don't ignore that voice! Listen to it, no matter how small it is. I'm just a beggar telling other beggars where they can go to find the Bread of Life.  Don't let anything stop you from finding God. To quote Erwin Lutzer: ""Standing at the Great White Throne Judgment will be hordes from every country of the world, from every religion in the world, with the best intentions in the world. They will learn too late that God is serious about justice, and if Christ does not bear their punishment, they must bear their own.""  Don't lose your life! Let Christ save you while there's still time.",0,0,OtterloopB,_BcYBFC6zfY,0.08249744769119773,2018-06-06 15:07:47,True,True

2018-06-06T20:27:03,"This movie is absolutely utterly atrocious, disgraceful and worthless. If you calculate the surface area of all of the characters in Wreck It Ralph, divide it by all of the princesses in the trailer, you‚Äôll be given 1.26. That number is the rating of both of the Wreck It Ralph Movies. The movie will have old references from 2016, so that will make the movie a much more painful experience. If you pause the movie at the 15th millisecond, you‚Äôll see a secret message that indicates that Wreck It Ralph 2 is going to be a bad movie. I‚Äôve also done some math. Two movie trailers on trending. Wreck It Ralph TWO and LEGO Movie TWO. Wreck It Ralph is number TWO on trending, and TWO multiplied by TWO gives you 4. Number 4 on Trending is the LEGO Movie TWO trailer. So our final conclusion is that both of the movies will be 2/10.  (The movie crisis has begun. Bumblebee. Spider-Man. LEGO Movie. Wreck It Ralph.

The scenes of her escaping from the Stormtroopers and meeting with the princesses look to be very interesting. It's also nice to finally hear what Knowsmore and Yesss are going to sound like. Also, I think the first scene in the trailer is from later in the movie (warning: possible spoilers!);  Ralph and Vanellope are blamed for the damage to Sugar Rush and as a result Vanellope is forced to hide out in Fix- It Felix Jr. where she falls asleep on Ralph's stump and gets startled awake by him later when he suggests a trip to the internet.

2018-06-11T05:11:21,"Sigh.....another modern movie where all the male characters are either stupid buffoons or sarcastic emoqueers. I realized a while ago that part of the appeal of superhero movies today is that the main characters were created in the 60s or 70s so modern screenwriters can't turn them into faggots without seriously damaging the content. In the end, it's really such a simple concept: ""write good characters, don't write bad characters"".   Look at Batman for example. Batman is awesome. Why? Batman is awesome because he's a man. If Batman was a sissy, he wouldn't be awesome. Now I challenge anyone to name one male non-sissy character in a modern non-superhero movie. You can't because there aren't any and they're all lame. None of them are cool. Ever since the Illumiscum started pushing their emasculation agenda, Hollywood writers started trying to eliminate the good, masculine, male character from movies so now they're all sissy faggots and emoqueers. If Samuel L. Jackson was trying to make a name for himself today, he wouldn't be able to because his role doesn't exist anymore and that would be a shame because Samuel L. Jackson is a damn good actor.  The first Wreck-it Ralph was actually quite good because, although it had some feminist tropes, it didn't over-do it to the point of obnoxiousness. This one I think will probably be _aight_ too because it has some things working in its favor: the little girl is still cute and likeable, the movie looks good from an artistic standpoint, the plot is creative and original, and some of the jokes are actually funny. Likeable characters, good artwork, creativity, and humor; all tried and tested formulas for making a good animated movie that have and will continue going forward into the future to stand the passage-of-time.   But you have to wonder sometimes where this is all heading. Are the Hollywood Illumiscum trying to ruin entertainment forever and will they succeed in their nefariousness? Only those of us who are around long enough will see, I suppose.",0,0,William Ogden,_BcYBFC6zfY,0.2398504273504273,2018-06-11 05:11:21,True,True

2018-07-17T18:35:00,"Time to roast the feminists in this movie:  Rapunzel, You're certainly one to talk, considering the fact that you-and about EVERY SINGLE OTHER PRINCESS IN THIS ROOM got their problems solved because a big strong man showed up(AND I DON'T CARE IF THIS IS JUST DISNEY POKING FUN AT ITSELF).  Let's start with Cinderella, shall we? When you went to the ball, you immediately caught the eye of Prince Charming, and if he hadn't become so obsessed with your beauty and finding you to be his wife, you'd still be a slave at the hands of those three egotistical ----- -------- you call your stepfamily.  How about Belle? Granted she is probably one of the most intelligent of you lot, but the only difference here is that your problem WAS a big strong man showing up(Gaston). And it was only solved when another big strong man (The Beast) and you met up and realized that true beauty is found within and blah blah blah.  Snow White's story? When the evil queen showed up disguised as an old hag and put you into euthanasia with a poisoned apple, it was up to your very own prince to wake you up with true love's kiss. And considering the fact that you were practically singing ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" throughout the ENTIRETY of your movie, there is no chance in hell you can claim the mantle of ""independent woman"".  Then there's Rapunzel. In the original story, you were found by (Guess again) ANOTHER prince for whom you let down your hair. And after you were cast off in god knows where, the prince, though blinded, was the one who found you due to your singing voice. In Tangled, if it wasn't for that thief Eugene Fitzherbert, you would still be gleefully ignorant locked away by Mother Gothel. Heck, I don't even know why I call her ""Mother"", she is a mother to the devil only.  Next up is Moana. She could have NEVER restored the heart of Te Fiti on her own. She needed the help of Maui, who although was the reason this problem existed in the first place, was a key part in solving this problem. And though you say you're simply the daughter of the chief, I tend to agree with the Rock on your true status.  Anna...sweet naive pitiful Anna. The fact that your father locked you and your sister away for thirteen years should have driven you both insane. It's wonder why you weren't. But even after Elsa revealed her powers, it was Kristoff who took you up the North Mountain to get her down.  Pocahontas, you're not actually a princess-but your problems in the movie were partly solved by a man, namely John Smith. And whether or not you stood in the way of your father's mace as part of some ritual of goodwill or whether you truly did love him, proves you are everything BUT independent.  Even Tiana doesn't count for this, because although she DID work her butt off to raise money to open her own restaurant, the final push to achieve her dream came from Prince Navine.  And how about Ariel. Her vast curiosity was only sated after meeting Prince Eric, whom she went to great lengths to get her own set of legs to join him on land and eventually marry.  Then we have Merida. Now it's true she did attempt to take her marriage situation into her own hands by cheating the entire trial to find you a husband, but the clues of how to make things right with your mother came from the story of who? You guessed it, the story of a big strong man who let his pride get the better of him, but a big strong man nonetheless. In fact he wasn't just a big strong man, he was a big man with the strength of ten men.  Jasmine, your story is quite similar to Merida's, in that your parents both tried to force you to marry when you either didn't want to or hadn't found the right person. The difference here, is that a man DID show up, who happened to be a ""street rat"", but you ended up marrying him anyways, solving that problem and, alongside him, ridding your Sultanate of the villain Jafar once and for all.  And finally you, Vanellope. If it wasn't for Wreck-it Ralph, you'd still be trapped inside your own game and everyone would think that you are a glitch.  In fact, the only two people in this room who DIDN'T get their problems solved by a big strong man showing up are Elsa and Mulan, and they're not even Princesses at all!(one of them is a Queen and the other is not related to a royal family)",63,18,Alon Alkalai,_BcYBFC6zfY,0.14536816578483241,2018-07-17 18:35:00,True,True

Way to strip the princess' of dignity and femininity and make them just a pack of dogs. Btw, the Arandale sisters ALSO did not utilize a man, in spite of Anna clearly wanting one.  Also! Elsa is a queen and the ONE princess who had breasts, Pocahontas, was stripped of her curves. What is the matter with curves!

(I just hate pandering feminist statements so fucking sue me.)    WHY   Pocahontas: Went against marrying a man that she doesn't love and falls in love with John Smith (at least in the movie). Her father tries to kill John but she _risks her life in order to save him._ If anyone, she's the ""strong man.""   Rapunzel (Tangled Version): She didn't leave because a ""strong man"" showed up. In fact, when Flynn showed up she knocked his ass out with a pan. Things ""went right"" because of her curiosity regarding finding the source of the lanterns. Though Flynn is great, he grew into a different person because of Rapunzel.   Elsa: Bitch... that whole movie was about sisterly love and she didn't even have anyone going after her (unless you count Hans but that wouldn't work out).   Cinderella: If any ""strong man"" came into her life and made things right, it was her fucking Fairy Godmother.   Jasmine: _SHE IS NOT A PRIZE TO BE WON_ I mean how fucking dare you... honestly she was the most independent out of most of them. (also Raja can't talk)    Snow White: I guess this is the closest to accurate, however, the ""strong man"" was actually seven dwarves that helped her so that she wouldn't be killed...   Sleeping Beauty: Okay... I get this one. But then again, things didn't go right for her when he showed up... things started going very very very very wrong.   Tiana: I mean... she was pretty independent... really, actually. Also, the guy made things go worse before it got better.   Belle: Bruh... she was enslaved because _she told Adam to enslave you so she could save her father._ Also, who would the strong man who made things better? Gaston? No. Beast, not really. Honestly, Belle was the one who arrived at the castle and made everything better, not the other way around.   Merida: Don't even fucking start with me. That movie was about her and her mother and that's pretty much it dammit.   If you made it this far, thank you.

2019-07-19T13:45:40,"Overall, Ralph Breaks the Internet proves what most sequels desire to be ‚Äì it expands on the characters we have come to know and love while staying true to its roots of friendship and self-discovery. The stunning immensity of the Internet introduces plenty of ‚Äústicky situations‚Äù for Ralph and Vanellope to encounter, and this story takes us on a whimsical and faced-paced trip from the dark web to eBay. While Ralph is often presented as overly weak and insecure in comparison to his emotional strength in the finale of Wreck-it Ralph, Vanellope is able to find amazing self-growth throughout the film, and the two friends emerge ready to face the day. The works of Henry Jackman and Alan Menken serve to bring out ‚Äúthe feels‚Äù, while KnowsMore and the gang help to keep things light and hilarious. While not as refined as its predecessor, Ralph Breaks the Internet is a great addition to the Disney lineup, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what the future holds for Ralph and Vanellope.

2020-04-26T20:22:22,I hate this movie :-( Spoilers!!!)    I went from totally loving the first film and Ralph and Vanellope to hating them in this movie.... like how do you do that ?! Wreck it Ralph went from one of top Disney films to the sequel being one of the worst imo üòã. I was so annoyed that: (SPOILERS)     -Calhon (sp?) and Fix it Felix were hardly in the movie and their subplot barely got any screen time üò°  -They made Ralph really stupid in the sequel and Vanellope imo selfish  -I thought the whole point of the first movie was that characters couldn't leave their game ???? Yet Vanellope does just that even though shes the leader and her picture was on the side of the machine !!! (Shown in the first film) wouldn't the children playing the game be like wheres that character gone ???? üòê  -the Disney princess scene was sooooo forced and unfunny it was unbelievable and again made Ralph look like an idiot üò°  -oh and talking about the princess scene  what also really annoyed me was that in the first film Vanellope says she doesn't want to be a princess... more like a president which I loved ! But nope in this film she just says shes a princess üôÑüôÑ  -ugh really hated this film and was sooo disappointed with it. I really wanted a Zootopia sequel but now I'm not sure as it's by the same people and I don't want them to ruin the first film for me as they have done with Wreck It Ralph üò°üò°,0,0,Joe23,_BcYBFC6zfY,-0.2045138888888889,2020-04-26 20:22:22,False,False
