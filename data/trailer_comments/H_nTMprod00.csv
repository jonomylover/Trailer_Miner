Horror is my favourite genre but these films are all garbage, go back to the film of the 70's and 80's to see what real horror is. I mean how hard must it be for these horror movie directors, just watch a film like The Shining and follow the same blueprint and you have a REAL horror film. Music, suspense, backstory (optimised through the characters behaviour), fear (it's not all about 2 seconds of jump scare, you need to show the horror for a continues time and make the audience feel the same fear as the character) and so so much more.

I watched it all...love it! I also wanna watch it follows which I'm not allowed AND I HAVE NO ACTUAL CLUE WHY!!!!!!! which makes me so angry!!! And I wanna watch truth or dare, even though that smile creeps me out from the trailer it still looks epic and I swear if i can't watch that film either!!! I will and i mean I WILL watch it follows one day when im probably 14! My mum said no to lights out until i was like 17 but here she is letting me watch it when im 12, probably gonna be the same for it follows because IT IS THE SAME RATING AND SAME EVERYTHING IN IT AS LIGHTS OUT AND I HAVE NO CLUE WHY THAT FILM IS SO APPARENTLY ""BAD""",0,0,Angie Stoker,H_nTMprod00,-0.0685267857142857,2020-01-18 11:12:02,False,False
