2017-06-29T06:07:38,"Thoughts:  The spaceship thing seems strange, I know MLP plays fairly loose with the rules of fantasy but that's a little shark jumpy.  The sea ponies are a great idea though, I like world building. Twilight's word choice of ""save Equestria"" was interesting when talking to them. Are they part of Equestria? Are they allies of Equestria? If so it seems strange we've never heard of them. Maybe they were just persuaded to think Equestria was worth saving, but it is odd.   Anyway whatever I like the whole idea of exploring the oceans around Equestria and introducing the sea ponies like this.  Other thoughts, um the animation works very well for long shots, the awkward 3D effect is a bit weird in close ups though. So I hope they don't do too many close up shots. It is an action film so presumably they won't which is good lol. But yeah in long shots it works great, the characters looks great and the environments look mostly great as well.  But yeah I don't know, I'm all for pushing genre boundaries if it's done right but these alien things seem a bit forced in there, I'm not sure if that'll work. I hope it does work and I'm just whining about nothing, but I really don't know lol.

2017-06-29T09:31:31,"WARNING: This is not a hate post, it's just an objective mixed with subjective opinion (pff, who am I kidding, this disclaimer will NEVER work... xD )  Can't say I'm a big fan of the new animation, I think Disney makes a better use of ToonBoom mixed with 2D (this was an OBJECTIVE opinion). The art itself is the most jarring thing to me, it'll take a lot of getting used to me, but that's my SUBJECTIVE opinion.   More OBJECTIVE opinions: What I'm really worried about, though, is the story and writing. I hope it won't be a common Hollywood blockbuster story, with the ""bad guys come, need help from others, insert comic relief just because and painstakingly adhere to the typical three act structure"" that I'm getting sick of in American animation movie, it's too predictable. Megan McCarthy always had this tendency when writing TV show finales, especially ""A Canterlot Wedding"" that could have been better.  More SUBJECTIVE opinions: But I DO like the broken-horned unicorn (great design and great potential backstory!) and the villain, also with a great design, keeps reminding me of MojoJojo in a good way. :D As for the Sea Ponies... well, world building, I guess, but at least their designs are good, at least compared to the godawful G1 designs... I also like the new Canterlot design: finally a BIG capital city!  BTW... where the heck is Starlight Glimmer? Did she go on vacation? o_O  But, as with most recent American trailers, they rarely give the right feeling of the movie. So I hope my writing and story worries are unfounded and the MLP G4 movie is something that Lauren Faust would be proud of. :)",7,3,tugatomsk,kIv_ConaZ1c,0.19945095554851655,2017-06-29 09:31:31,True,True

Adults enjoy whatever media they want, because they're adults living their own lives how they want, not children living under the rules of some one else.  ‚ÄúCritics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.‚Äù   ‚Äï C.S.

From the looks of it, it was made with a different animation tool than the show itself (I'm pretty sure it's Flash), and the art style also took me completely by surprise.  But not a bad surprise, it actually makes the ponies look really adorable, even if it took about a minute to get used to.    One thing I didn't like was how it hardly looks like it goes above even 30 frames per second.  Granted I don't think it will be that much of an issue, it's still fairly noticeable in parts.  Also the lip syncing looks sub par in some places.  On top of that the overall plot of the movie seems pretty overdone, especially in mlp in general.  ""Great, powerful, evil enemy invades Equestria""... sound familiar?  Tirek, Chrysalis, even Discord kind of.  But I've seen this in so many other movies as well.  I can look past it though simply because it's mlp <3 And of course it looks like there's more going on in this trailer, so maybe it will have that extra creative burst I was hoping for when I first heard about this movie when I end up watching it.  Regardless, I'm really looking forward to seeing this movie.  It has pros and cons of course, but every movie does.  I really hope this will lock the show into a solid few more seasons, too.  I feel like the show is spiraling downward in terms of popularity, at least in the fandom.  It isn't what it used to be... maybe this will launch it into a new era.

2017-09-12T18:29:32,"I know I might disappoint some of my fellow MLP fans, but I'm having mixed feelings about this movie ever since the show started going insanely downhill when Starlight was forcefully wedged into the main cast.   The animation is gorgeous and definitely makes it stand out from all the usual episodes' animation style, and the visuals and scenes absolutely have a breath-taking feeling going for them. I'll admit that.  But I'm alittle worried about how the cast and the movie will go. The lack of Rarity, Applejack, and Fluttershy, to the point of them not even getting a single line in this trailer deeply worries me. A giant flaw the most recent episodes had was making Pinkie Pie way over the top for the sole purpose of making her comedic relief and nothing else, to the point of showing no fear and being alittle ""too"" happy about even grim-looking situations, which 1:25 proves might keep her as solely a joke and not ""real"" character, which disappoints me already.   The new characters certainly are certainly well-designed and interesting, but not might fit really well into the MLP universe. I'm really iffy about this Tempest mare and her... seemingly alien force. (Which worries me, too... As throwing aliens into anything can utterly destroy it for me.) Aswell as her design having some very... IDK how to put it... I guess I'll use ""OC design-ish"" to describe her. Unicorns with broken horns has been rather cliched in the MLP community for tons of people and the name ""Tempest"" isn't the most original name out there.   I know I'm probably sounding super picky and rude, by now, but I'm sorry. I'd like to just get this off my chest.  I'm also iffy about the pirates. While, again, their design are unique and memorable, I feel like they're kinda outlandish, as well. They've been throwing tons of new species and creatures into MLP for a while now, and tons of new characters to the point where it's getting alittle difficult to remember them all. MLP already has tons of memorable characters and some bad ones, so I'm unsure if they have time or the writing to put in all these unique characters that will hopefully have time to develop over the course of the movie and not just be there because they look pretty. I suppose it's for the movie, so hopefully they'll be an important part of it. Along with maybe the seaponies. I'm the kind of person who likes to watch animal movies, and I've noticed a big flaw that most of the movies almost always suffer from: Making way too many characters for the story to follow, resulting in very few of them getting good development.  Lastly, the movie seems like it won't really be too touching, which in my opinion might hurt it. There's so many characters that seem like they'll be there just for comedic relief and jokes, so the real ""conflict"" doesn't seem like a real conflict when everyone's too busy cracking off jokes. I know it's an MLP movie, but I'd love an mlp movie that has touching and deep moments with a real heart to heart between characters instead of ""I'll stop you!"" and then Pinkie or side bad guy making a cake or pie joke. I'd love to see some heart-twisting moments and a real remember-able ending to this movie, and not just a laughfest that makes you feel no real tension.  I know I went off on quite a tangent about this. I'm really hyped up and interested in seeing this. I'm just worried deeply that the movie might just be ""meh"" instead of breath-taking. But... hey. Atleast Starlight Glimmer won't be hurting the movie by being in it, so that's a plus in my books.",0,1,Syriel Nightfall,kIv_ConaZ1c,0.1519587129288622,2017-09-12 18:29:32,True,True

The animation's very fluid and beautiful with details, and it seems to have an interesting story and would most likely have funny villains with some serious ones. Despite being 16 and a former brony since 2014, this might actually spark up my interest in it again.

2017-10-08T20:50:47,"I saw the film just yesterday, and, in my most honest opinion, I had mixed feelings. The film DID feature the same main characters (and their voice actors) from the TV series, showed more familiar characters in the background, introduced new areas and characters not seen in the series, had an assortment of good songs, and had beautiful animation.  However, there were a few small details about the film that didn't quite give it the same spark as the TV series.   First, the pacing of the film was just a little too quick, and didn't provide time for more possible drama and action moments; granted, the writers were limited to only one hour and thirty-five minutes.   Second, is that the humor that helped make the TV series fun for Brony fans to watch was stretched a little thin in the film.   Third, I think the personalities of the three antagonists (The Storm King, Tempest Shadow, and Grubber) could've used a little adjusting; The Storm King could've been more threatening (like Tirek from the Season 4 finale); Grubber could've been less awkward and food obsessed, and was more of a secretly loyal and dependable friend; Tempest could've been a little less mechanical and showed a little more fury and pangs of guilt and regret. Finally, I think the final confrontation between the Mane Six and the Storm King could've been a bit more epic; all of their allies from the past seasons (all the ponies of Equestria, The Crystal Ponies, Ember and the dragons, Thorax and the Changelings, and Dischord) rallying together to help defeat the Storm King.  I'm not saying it's bad film, I'm just saying that it's a little different from the TV series that Lauren Faust created.  Still, this is just MY personal opinion alone.  I hope this film satisfies the enjoyment of all other fans of MLP: FIM; especially for all you loyal and good-hearted Brony fans!",0,0,Lucas Clement,kIv_ConaZ1c,0.07113203463203462,2017-10-08 20:50:47,False,True

Now the reason why I think this is the main problem is because not only does it ruin to whole point of this (because it's slice of life show.) But it's a terrible thing for children to learn at a young age, because then they will think that friendship is the answer to all of their problems, and won't use basic problem solving to fix their problems.

Plus, Shakira as Songbird's friend, Blue Tulips, an alicorn with a fantastic singing voice. And they should add in Mandy Moore as Whispering Winds, an alicorn who works for the Dragons and Karen Gillan as Deadly Nightshade, another secondary antagonist for the movie. The main villain should be played by Patrick Stewart who plays Raging Fire's oldest brother, Black Flame, the first king of dragons on Earth. But, if they do bring in a ""Storm Queen,"" then, she should be voiced by non other than Dead Rising actress, ""Kim Mai Guest."" The stars are obviously Tara Strong as Twilight, Andrea Libman as Fluttershy and Pinkie, Ashleigh Ball as Rainbow Dash and Applejack, Tabitha St. Germain as Rarity and a few other additional voices and Cathy Weseluck as Spike along with Emily Blunt, Michael Pe√±a, Taye Diggs, Zoe Saldana, Uzo Aduba and Kristin Chenoweth. But the new characters for the second film should like the ones I mentioned. And I was thinking about the main villain should be played by David Warner, a British actor instead of Patrick Stewart and what not as maybe the first king of Dragons. Shining Armor should come back as well. Flim and Flam, voiced by Samuel Vincent and Scott McNeil, maybe Discord, voiced by John de Lancie as well. Gilda, Iron Will, don't care who. Catherine O'Hara should play someone too. Since they don't often ask old celebrities to play in movies anymore, I thought maybe they would be in the next movie too. Steve Martin would be a good choice too if he didn't cost a lot of money. But Shakira would do nice for Blue Tulips.",0,0,Alexander Krzywicki,kIv_ConaZ1c,0.15565110565110565,2020-05-01 16:16:26,False,False
