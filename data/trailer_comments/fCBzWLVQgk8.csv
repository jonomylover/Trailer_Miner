Rocky didn't fight for money or winning or just to physically beat somebody, Rocky was a boxer because that's all he knew, that's all he was good at, he has heart. Creed looks like it's all about anger, pain, winning and lust/love. I don't want that, that's like every other sport movie, I want something likable and loveable like Rocky. You know?

2015-07-19T21:24:17,"Things I want to see in Creed:  1). Rocky feeling guilty over the death of Apollo in Rocky IV when Rocky wanted to stop Apollo's fight with Drago but Apollo made him promise not to no matter what despite the savage mauling he was taking at Drago's hands & because Rocky chose to listen to Apollo, it sealed Apollo's fate. Upon meeting Apollo's son for the very 1st time, you gotta believe that the ol' Italian Stallion finds himself overwhelmed with haunting images of Apollo dying in front of him & when he was close to throwing in the towel when Apollo yelled no & he listened causing him to feel great shame & guilt around the younger Creed.  2). Rocky very reluctant & hesitant to once again take on the role of mentor & trainer to another promising young up & comer due to the heartbreaking & treacherous events of Rocky V when Rocky took under his wing the talented but volatile Tommy Gunn ( RIP Tommy Morrison) & tried to be for Tommy what Mickey was to him until the ultra-corrupting & greedy influence of Don King-like promoter George Washington Duke succeeded in turning the easily-swayed & impatient Gunn against Rocky completely to the point where Tommy right after winning the HW Championship thanked Duke instead of Rocky just cause Duke got him his title shot. After mentoring a young fighter whom he came to regard as a surrogate son who in turn betrayed him in such a cruel & twisted way after Tommy allowed himself to easily fall prey with Duke's help to all the excess & temptations that come with glory & success to go straight to his head forcing Rocky to put his former protege down in a brutal televised street fight, Rocky understandably has to have serious reservations & doubts about taking on another student & his own abilities as a capable mentor now matter how much a cherished friend & respected rival Apollo was to him & how much he feels he owes to his son.  3). In none of the previous Rocky films do we ever find out the fates & whereabouts of Rocky's previous foes with the obvious exceptions of both Apollo Creed & Spider Rico (Rocky's very 1st opponent from the original classic). I know that I'm definitely not alone in saying I wanna know what ultimately became of the likes of Clubber Lang, Drago, Tommy Gunn & even the ever-scheming Duke after Rocky KO'ed each & everyone of them!!!  4). Creed's son confronting Drago over the death of his legendary father. I'm not talking about a fight mind you but a tense verbal face to face confrontation with Rocky helping Creed's son to track down Drago so the younger Creed can ask Drago the hard questions like whether he went into the fight intending to kill Apollo right from the beginning or not & whether or not he ever even once felt any genuine remorse over killing Apollo than afterwards saying those infamous cold-blooded words (If he dies...He dies). This one seems like a longshot but given that Sly & Dolph reunited for The Expendables movies, you never know!  Can't wait 4 Creed!!!

2016-01-16T23:40:06,MY RATING - 8 out of 10 I grew up on watching Rocky films and my kids have seen re-runs of them all too . They are an important part of my movie watching history but Creed feels like an end of an era. This is right up there with the best of them. It reminded me a lot of the first two films. Gritty yet still with the over the top boxing action. This is Stallone's best acting performance of the lot though. He really gets back to grass roots with this performance. Michael B. Jordan is excellent too but what was really surprising was the acting from the real life boxers Andre Ward and Tony Bellew.  The one strange thing is the Everton connection to the film. Fans at the fight wearing Everton scarfs and singing Everton songs. Strange. I wonder what the American audience thought of it.  All in all I enjoyed this as I have done with most of the films.,0,0,redvalleyjohn,fCBzWLVQgk8,0.32678571428571435,2016-01-16 23:40:06,False,True
