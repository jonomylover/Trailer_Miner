Some of these comments... xD My opinion on the movie is this: The story-line may seem cheesy, Keanu Reeves may have a shitty name in the movie and it may look like mindless destruction driven lead-to-air slow-mo-walking-away-from-explosions madness, but I mean.. Hey... What's wrong with that? I think the point is that Directors are running out of ideas for movies, and creating some pretty dumb ones (ie: I, Frankenstein). Chad Stahelski seems like what he's trying to say is, a movie doesn't need to have a story-line that has been created over the span of 10 years that creates a vortex in the space-time continuum and literally blows minds away with it's plot twists. When most of us watch a movie involving loss, revenge, assassins and mayhem, all we really want to see is a few close combat fights involving multiple people getting there ass kicked, incredible reaction timing and accuracy, cool assassin stuff, the ""Bad"" guy getting beaten through impossible odds, and a lot of blood and ingenious deaths. It seems as though that is delivered in this case. Plus, Reeves is actually one of the good actors in my opinion. Not the best, but legendary nonetheless. ""It's not WHAT you did, son.. It's WHO you did it to..."" Btw, Kelime, ""Don't kill a retired Hit-man's puppy that was a gift from his dying wife.

John wick was not a good man, he bathed in the blood from countless years as a hit-man working for mob bosses. Yet he was pulled from this life when he met the love of his life and his future wife . She tamed the beast beast within him and put it to sleep. Sadly this would not last, as she was taken from him due to an unknown illness. Now alone, there was nothing to keep him from falling back into the darkness from whence he came. Save Daisy a puppy, given to John as a parting gift from his late wife who knew John needed something to hold on to after she was gone. No longer alone, John had hope, he no longer had to grieve by himself, he was going to make it through this.   Now this ""punk-ass-bitch"" breaks into his house, steals his car (and not just any car, that ride is beyond sweet) and kills Daisy the last thing he'll receive from his late wife. With Daisy gone, there is nothing left in John but sadness and hate. The beast that had been sleeping, now awakes and there's nothing left  to restrain it.

The biggest Plot twists, the best jokes and... no idea a showcase of every potential gunfight in the movie I guess... I wished the trailer would have been ...more thought through. From the little bit we see we already know okay, this guy lost his wife, now they stole his car, they killed his dog and hes about to fuck em over. We even see how hes beeing turned on in the hotel.
