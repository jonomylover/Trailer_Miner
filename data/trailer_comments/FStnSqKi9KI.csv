2017-07-06T19:22:22,"Jesus Christ is the son of God and he died on the cross to save you from your sins and rose from the so if you believe in him you shall not perish but have eternal life though him. Those who do not put their faith and trust in Jesus are deserving of hell because they are not accepting the gift of salvation and they could accept the gift of salvation by placing your faith and trust in Jesus Christ as your lord and savior. In hell there is no peace, love or joy and there is eternal separation from a holy God. But those who put their faith and trust in Jesus Christ will enter God's kingdom in heaven. In heaven there is true love, peace and joy and it's beyond human understanding. We all have sinned and fall short to God's infinite glory. I use to be bad, I lied, stole, committed sexual immorality and many more but I started to read the Bible and the more I read it the more my heart and my living began to change. The words of God are powerful and effective, sharper then a sword. Jesus promised to give his Holy Spirit to those who believe and God gave me his Holy Spirit and now I experience the love and power of God everyday and it's beyond human understanding:) God could give you his Holy Spirit, who can guide you everyday of your life, comfort you in times of need and help you with any area of your life, if you let him. God is faithful and would never give up on you no matter what. God loves you so very much and he showed that love by sending his son Jesus into the world to die for us on the cross and to bear our sins when they were our sins to bear and then Jesus rose from the dead and now is exalted and his name is above every name. If you want Jesus in your life, he can be in your life right now, you could pray and ask him and he will hear and answer your prayer. God will reveal himself to those who seek him. If you have questions about Jesus or want me to pray for anything I'm here. Also I have a video called God loves all:message, if your interested. God bless your hearts and I hope you have a great and wonderful rest of your year!:)",0,0,brandon caruso,FStnSqKi9KI,0.33663865546218497,2017-07-06 19:22:22,True,True

We somehow saw the entire family in 2012 drive through an earthquake disaster, that conveniently chased them for plot purposes, and destroyed multiple other cars trying to escape. Why? Because protagonists love their plot armor. We also saw an amatuer pilot drive through a city of falling buildings at low altitudes and somehow didn't die there. Did I forget the part where Yellowstone erupted and the guy somehow managed to escape in the RV? Morale: If you have three lives, you are definitely dying in the three scenarios I just mentioned.  Let's not forget San Andreas when they couldn't even let the girl drown at the end. Nope, the whole family just had to live through boating in a flooded city, dodging collapsing buildings/debris, or basically any situation where water should've killed them.  Now this movie looks like it hired the special effects crew from Sharknado.

Maybe one day we'll get something a little more serious and dramatic from this genre. It's very hard to do, because drama comes from characters and their struggles.

Cloud dabbing with a wave of micro delight, all feathered in cloudy mists to hang like a veil upon our heads, a mushroom from above, our special Jellyfish bowl to live under. Best thing is, we don't have to wait for it. Ladies and Gentlemen before our eyes history was made weeks ago. Now we we are to witness its unfoldment. Remember we are entertainment trained. We know how to select from a wrapper touting sweets, all sugar and we are addicted. We know and expect whats coming! Car chases for hours on nightly news? Is that interesting? Really? Maybe, Hurricanes ratings will sky rocket if all the crews in place, timed and coordinated like an exercise all up for the ruse, the real reason behind altruistic sentiments aimed from the shoulder. True history is made in a capsule to explode in time under the elements built upon Godly Forces of Nature. (Right that the news, ok.) Because our hero's our fearless reporters all wet and cold out there delivering for Joe public what we need to see. Now we know what to say to each other with some level of authority. ""A bunch of actors in script. All day, what do we hear? What a storm, what force, what control and not in the sky alone, wink, wink.

To have the ability to steer weather then the ability to thwart catastrophe is logical and applicable if administered. It is criminal to deliberately cause human deaths as a heeling exercise.  Crushing, no one wonders why these movies are made? Did the public have any say? No we are pavlovian waiting for the next thrill, keeping us salivating for the next catastrophes unfoldment. We remember,  starting as concern, rising into alarm and then....we wait to be told? thats right! as we are ferried without. warning  ! We have been trained to accept this entertainment.
