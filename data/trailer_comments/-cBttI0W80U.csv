2015-06-17T15:47:16,"....I am a competitive dancer myself and this is the only step up movie that disappointed me. But also the concept behind this movie is amazing sometimes changes are a good thing. As for how they rearranged and paired up people from one movie to another movie I found a little off and kind of ruined the storyline in a way. It made it very hard to follow in certain areas and it didn't seem right. As for the dancing part in this movie you can't expect them not to try something different, in this case it was a little more theatrical so what? In the dance world you can not survive without making some sacrifices and yes that means changing up your image or dancing the style that you are used to dancing. This movie is actually very motivational to those that are dancers or those who want to be dancers in the future. If you look at the 1st step up movie that one incorporated some hip-hop but also some ballet and contemporary type style dancing. The second step up movie was street dancing mainly. The 3rd movie was a little bit weird and incorporated a few other styles of dance. Step up revolution was mainly hip hop as well as very little contemporary on the girls side as well as making a statement and fighting for what you love. This movie included theatrical mainly. None of the step up movies are identical none of them are the same. So I do not see the point behind why people are making such a big deal on the style of dance they did in this movie...",2,0,Darling Freckles,-cBttI0W80U,0.025674019607843143,2015-06-17 15:47:16,False,False
