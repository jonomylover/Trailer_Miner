2014-12-07T18:14:29,"The problem with a lot of these movies is that it depicts black people as helpless, and the white people as the saviors. I saw ""The Help"" and ""The Blind Side"" within the past few years and I originally loved them. Great story, good actors, and it was heart-warming. What I didn't realize was that these movies are totally racially skewed. The theme of the good-hearted white person saving the poor black person or minority is prevalent in a lot of Hollywood movies. The focus is not on the struggle of the minority, but instead the change of character of the white person. So who can relate? White people of course! The targeted audience is white. Notice that the two films I listed above were Oscar nominated, along with Avatar, Cry Freedom, Dances with Wolves. Take a look at the plot of these movies and then you'll see what I'm talking about. White people eat this stuff up- and I will admit, I was one of them! The Blind Side was such a feel-good movie that made me believe that the world was really progressing in racial relations. And then I took a good look at myself and realized that I had never been remotely close to having a relationship like that with any non-white person. Most white people are feeling safe and sound living in suburbia bubble far away from most minorities who are struggling with the day-to-day violence in their communities. The suburbian's view on city life is that it is dangerous and filled with criminals- that's all that the news feeds them. So they associate that violence and crime with black people because that's all they know. If they actually took the time to take a trip down to the city, they would see that there are a lot of organizations and neighborhood groups that are making great efforts to improve the community.   You know what I'd like to see? A movie about a predominantly black community working in union with the white people in town to improve the conditions of the community- canvassing for votes on progressive laws, cleaning the environment, reforming education, providing healthy food for families of all backgrounds. I know this is happening because I was a part of it when I lived in Baltimore. This is really occurring in cities around the country, but we rarely hear about it on the news and in the media in general. Black, white, blue, rainbow people all working cohesively towards a common goal- and not because the white people have a change in character and now have sympathy for minorities. It's about coexisting- when white people stay far away from the crime-ridden cities, they have no idea what that life is like because they have chosen to ignore it. Ignorance is truly bliss. Open up your eyes. Take a stroll around a city and talk with people of different backgrounds- learn their stories, their struggles. Have a cup of coffee and a great conversation with people who are different from you, then you'll start seeing people that are unlike you as actual human beings rather than statistics, and you will have better perspective of the world.

2014-12-08T06:48:56,"It amazes me how much we don't know about our history or just down right don't   care  to know, or we  ignore it if  we ever did know. Of course there are racial undertones to  this movie yet they're also very true. My niece has hair similar to the girls in the movie and yes, her mom who's white do have a difficult time treating it. And sadly there are a lot of black men who use and a lot who dont.  However, you must remember that we did have a time in our society where blacks and whites died side by side in order for this nation to be free of this bigotry and racism. However,  the so- called (powers that be), or the devil,  and the media continue with their dividing us. Even Harriett Tubman had help from white people and if  all white people were evil we'd still be in slavery (the physical kind), we are obviously still mentally enslaved however that's another  story.  At the end of the day there are white people right now marching along side of us once again who are rarely depicted in the media. We have sooo many good people blacks and whites who are selfless, courageous and caring so please be careful about your remarks. My heart goes out to the many whites who have died for blacks. Their  stories are never ever told and its time that they are. Who will speak for the ones who have lost their voices due to the evil of men? Evil is the enemy not the color of our skin. Do you know there was also a time in our history where blacks and whites were not even categorize? Can you imagine that? If I'm not mistaken it was around the 1600's or a bit earlier when the issue with categorizing became the norm. But, I'ma keep on loving my black, white, Chinese, Hispanic, Italian friends until God take my breathe because my friends Rock! and God says:   O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah (God),  is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa (God-Consciousness). Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. 49:13  (Just waiting for someone to attack my faith now) Anyways, The best of you are those who have a God consciousness God don't look at your colors only man and the devil.

It is EVERYWHERE!- This has quietly been going on very many years and is nothing new to alot of us, but for some, it IS NEW, but -I cannot count how many interracial families I have seen in my life, (White and Black to be more specific as pertaining to this movie)  I saw while working at a local museum in my 10 years, for example!  For the most part, from who I saw, it was a greater number of  whites raising black children as opposed to the number of black and white couples I saw with either bi-racial children or the Black parents child.  I, for one,  think color should not be an issue, when the need for love, compassion and provision is the greater need.  In any case, I like a good movie, and the hair scene in the trailer though, reminds me alot of those white families with Black children I saw at the museum because most of them DID NOT comb the child's hair or moisturize their skin.  Their white kids were groomed about the hair for the most part, but WHEN I WOULD SEE THOSE BEAUTIFUL black children with THAT DRY, NAPPY (NOT FASHIONABLY KINKY), AND THEIR DRY SKIN, I found myself having to fight back saying anything out of the way of my position as they were guests to my workplace.  Those kids were so beautiful, but their hair!  Why would a parent let their child be seen out like that!  --It WAS HARD to see their parents REALLY DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO TAKE CARE OF A BLACK CHILD'S HAIR or skin.  Because so the dryness, if left un-attended can result in head sores skin problems. ""Black"" skin is typically dryer than white skin for various scientific reasons and require a slightly different type of hygienic regimen with regards to moisturizers for hair and body to stay healthy, particularly, for those people who live in cold weather climates such as where I worked at the museum.",0,0,jettair12,yqlE-7PP7Ho,0.12134848484848484,2015-01-12 22:02:05,True,True

Mark Binder (director and writer) based this off of events that were true in his life (a biracial grandson and his dead beat father and the traits of both sides of the family). The movie isn't racist but is showing that no matter what the background is... family is family. Having already seen this movie at a screening in which both Costner and Binder were in attendance and answering questions after the screening, I whole-heartedly believe in the message of the film. People need to stop playing the ""race card"" if we want to change the racist tension in America. It's comfortable for both sides to watch because it is very honest. Both the black side and white side of the family have their flaws in the movie. Binder did a great job at balancing both sides of the family to come together as one. One side of the family isn't overpowering throughout... they go back and forth. And a side note, so what if the white side of the family has more money? Costner is a lawyer in the film while Octavia Spencer owns about 5 or 6 different businesses. They are both successful in their own ways.
