At the exact moment that I went to do it, after praying for a sign and a reason to keep on going, my best friend FaceTimed me to tell me she loved me and give me a good God talk that prompted me to going into intensive therapy. My whole church was there with me, praying for me to help me get through my depression and anxiety. My friend later told me she just had a calling in her heart to call me right then that night and I believe that was God giving me my sign and telling me to hold on because things will get better with him. And they did. God doesn‚Äôt let bad things happen to us ‚Äî we live in a world run by Satan and the bad things that happen are satan‚Äôs doing. All we can do is pray and surrender and know that God is great and he will help us come out the other side of the fire, unscathed. Even when we feel as if we‚Äôre burning, God is making us knew.

But considering the fact that this movie is based off a true story, you all should be ashamed of yourselves for putting other beliefs and religions down. So what? This mother just so happened to pray for her sons life and her son just so happened to survive. Sure, some of you might say this is God‚Äôs doing, while some of you might say this was a miracle or that it was just a coincidence that this boy managed to live. With that said, whatever you believe feel free to say it. Unless however you are just going to put down everybody else for what they believe, than you can just keep it to yourself. Every religion has a purpose and reason. And yes that does include Atheism. Atheism might not be considered a religion by most people because atheists don‚Äôt believe in god, but they do still have beliefs. What I‚Äôm trying to say here, is that we all have different beliefs and I personally think that all of them should be accepted. I also think this movie might say something about that. Now please if you are going to comment anything can you at least make it a nice comment? And NOT attack others about their comments? And now I will ask of you all to please wait until this movie comes out and keep your hateful comments to yourself. Nobody wants to hear them. Most of you talk about how we as a race need to be accepting of other religions, genders, sexuality‚Äôs, etc. but when you make comments that are hateful against any of those things, you aren‚Äôt doing what you‚Äôre preaching. So please, fix your own hate and ignorance before saying anything. Religion is whatever you make of it. So don‚Äôt make it into something that‚Äôs going to turn people against each other. Thank you for reading all of this if you have. And for those of you who are going to write a hateful comment about the things I said (because I know somebody will) I‚Äôd like to thank you in advance. I highly appreciate the criticism. I‚Äôm sure I need some criticism in my life just like you do. (and no I‚Äôm not a hippy so you can‚Äôt make a hateful comment about that either).

Not to mention the black firefighter who had a beard and me being in the fire department I know you‚Äôre not allowed to have a beard and you must be clean-shaven so that wasn‚Äôt even realistic and just the way they did things in the movie were just so ridiculously cheesy that I almost had to leave and asked for my money back.
