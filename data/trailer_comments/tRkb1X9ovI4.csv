I also am curious as to how the project which originally was brought forth by Steven Spielberg himself.   Ended up this far down the director's pool is anyone's guess. Whitewashing elements aside however the bigger problem is a lack of forsight.  Not only did they get the Major's character completely wrong.

You took a story that revolves, at its core, very open ended questions about being a human and dealing with advancements in technology. Then you gut the whole thing out and water it down by telling the audience how to feel throughout the movie. On top of that you shove just about every chinese and US marketing trick in the book in order to get the thing to sell. Sucks that so much work was put into the movie by talented people, but was screwed up by the higherups who are too afraid of loosing a profit and play it safe.

It's a widespread issue that causes 'Big Film' companies to not gain revenue, thus not producing sequels to good movies. I don't get it.  It's okay to have an opinion, but most of the opinions are always biased where it's either: ""mmmyes, the novel was much better"" or ""mmmyes, the anime was far more interesting"".  Why can't people just ***ing watch a god**** movie and enjoy it. I'd like to see any of you snub-nosed, pajama-wearing, elitists, try to write, produce, direct, or even graphically animate any of these amazingly put together movies. A lot of hard work and effort goes into these and you're ruining it for everyone with 'The Pen is Mightier' stratagems.   Go **** off and ruin something else instead force-feeding the internet and further scaring off potential viewers who might actually enjoy something that you don't. The main problem is you're too arrogant and boring to be fully entertained, and nothing will sate your massive ego.
