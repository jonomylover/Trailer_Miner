2016-10-19T00:19:06,"Anyone bitching about the music choice clearly doesn't understand the point of a trailer.  The music choice, especially in action films,  is about pacing, energy and punctuating the clips with high energy music. Orchestral Scores are entirely different from the Soundtrack. Some movies have soundtracks and scores that are genre matches, some have orchestral scores that are vastly different from the Soundtrack. a Soundtrack is music that accompanies the movie, it generally includes licensed or commissioned music for the movie. Sometimes it includes the score, sometimes not. The Score is the music that plays to enhance scenes and embellish the story.  On top of that trailers have been using top 40 music since trailers became a thing. In this case its a high action, fast cut trailer that isnt telling much of the story, its sole purpose is to showcase the action aspect of the film. It requires music to match it, modern pop/rock does that better than an orchestral score. Next will come a trailer likely showcasing more of the story which probably will include a different feel and musical accompaniment.  If your entire issue with this trailer is that its ""music"" doesnt match what you feel the trailer should have then it appears Ubisoft has done a good job with the rest of it. Seems like a lot of digging to find a reason to be salty.",1,0,MissRhia,4haJD6W136c,0.18130434782608698,2016-10-19 00:19:06,True,True

2016-12-21T23:33:40,"Just came back from an early screening. I'm a big fan of the franchise, so I may be biased but I absolutely loved the film. I think, among fans of the franchise,  the viewing experience will greatly depend on how you look at the franchise.   Me, personally, think the present-timeline is an advantage and the heart of the franchise, rather than a weakness; therefore, I think putting emphasis on the present rather than the past is the right course of the franchise and of the film. However, I can see that those who are opposed to this notion will have a hard time of watching this film, as it jumps between timelines quickly.   I thought the film to have an engaging story, incredible action-sequences and aesthetics inspired by the games, wonderful music, wonderful cinematography and superb acting from the cast. It has everything to be a great film - and a great video-game inspired film at that - and it shouldn't be executed just yet by the critics.

Why hide it from the public?

2020-01-24T19:58:09,i didnt played the games just saw some gameplays but i don't like the movie. The script is awful. At least could be based on  time travel or 100% set in medieval age  but not based on a giant robotic arm from a simulation machine/simulator in some kind of facility .  Rated the movie 3 stars from 10. No wonder why its being rated 5.7 stars from 10. The movie is in the list of the worst dissapoinments @t The movie its like the end of some series or its not a prequel nor a sequel is ...something in between . You could make the movie with the begining of a nice story so you can make sequels. I have the feeling that 20 century fox ruined the chance to make a success story with sequels because of this movie.  I recommend to do another Assassin creed movie but this time without some kind of robotic arms and computers.,0,0,cris33311,4haJD6W136c,-0.036363636363636376,2020-01-24 19:58:09,False,False

My biggest criticism is the lack of time they spent in the historical setting, the main appeal of Assassin's Creed, which was due to tons of explanation for build-up. This was basically a requirement but also served as the core reason for it's failures. The overplottedness of the movie was a thing because there was too much talking about the ""Why"" of it all.
