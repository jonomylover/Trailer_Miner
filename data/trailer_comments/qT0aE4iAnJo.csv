2014-05-31T15:50:34,Read the book which does a good job of presenting the character of this schools football program through a telling of the actual events. It's not about talent.  As a high school football coach that coached in the bay area I can tell you that DLS does it like no other school in the country IMO. it's a very special place where the players are extraordinarily committed and accountable to each other. I  hope the director gets that right.   It looks like they are taking some liberties with the sequence of events. LB Poly game appears to come at the end in the film but in reality that game happened before the loss to Bellview and is a win in the streak not after.

He's only done it twice and that's about it, but the coolest experience I ever had practicing. I would believe their were four cones and I think it's called open field tackle, so If I can remember correctly I tackled a kid low around his stomach and I was able to get his feet off the turf grass so landed on his back on the grass. Anyway back to the movie, the 151 win steak is pretty incredible without a doubt. Though it wasn't all about that, it was the team for they their beliefs were and what they stand for as a brotherhood that is almost like a family to be able to help each other out not only on the field but off the field as well is what this movie stood out interpreted like that. It was about their head teaching and helping those young man a direction where it would take them, so I thought in my opinion it was such a good movie that's not only one of the best films in 2014 but also about as good as Friday Night Lights.   P.S. Playing in football for the first time in my life was fun though most of the practices were hard and I didn't get as many opportunities playing on the field against our opponents, but that's okay I didn't feel like I was fit in. In my high school years, I've participated in Track & Field from my freshmen year to senior year, and I also join Cross Country in my sophomore year.

2019-07-05T06:01:08,"Here’s a great idea. You know how every sports movie ever made is about the pathetic underdog team that never wins any games, then at the end of the movie they end up beating the undefeated douchebag team? What if we subverted that and make the undefeated team the protagonist and have the audience try to sympathize with them when they act like cry bandies when they lose one game out of over 100 games. Then have the team not learn any humiliation, and end the movie with them winning again and continuing to act like egotistical assholes. Thus teaching the audience that if you don’t win all the time, your life will be ruined and all your loved ones will die.",0,0,Queen_Bratz,qT0aE4iAnJo,0.17857142857142858,2019-07-05 06:01:08,False,False
