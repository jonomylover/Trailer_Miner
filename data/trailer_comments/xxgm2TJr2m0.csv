When you read the Gospel accounts of the Resurrection, it's quite clear that the man the disciples claimed to have seen after Jesus death was lookin' somewhat different than the Jesus they knew, since they had trouble to recognized him!  In fact, it's quite clear that they all needed some kind of sign from the Resurrected Christ to finally recognize him...  In that context, I seriously doubt that someone, right after the event, would have clearly said something like : I saw THAT SAME MAN alive again...  His testimony would surely have been much more prudent and subtle than that.  Also, nowhere in the Christian AND the pagan littérature of Antiquity we can find any credible account referring to an official inquiry about Jesus' Resurrection by the Romans...  For most of them (including Pilatus), this kind of religious story was probably just one more ""Jewish fable"" and I'm pretty sure they didn't lose too much time to investigate that.

You need affirmation that you are right because being wrong in this case would mean a horrifying eternal consequence. The fact is, Jesus is still there for you no matter what you've said or done. He loves you. He died for you. He offers an eternity in Heaven and all you have to do is accept Him and live a moral life. He is waiting, but time will eventually run out.

Since we love God we want to be obedient. “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also” (James 2:26). Faith without works is a dead faith because the lack of works reveals an unchanged life or a spiritually dead heart. There are many verses that say that true saving faith will result in a transformed life, that faith is demonstrated by the works we do. How we live reveals what we believe and whether the faith we profess to have is a living faith. Many claim to be Christians but their lives do not match up. Unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.  2 Corinthians 5:17.

You have the sealed tomb and all that, and that's great, but whats this about an Imperial Visit? Was it really necessary to throw the Shroud of Turin in the movie (the shroud was never mentioned in the bible, and it almost certainly dates back to late-medieval Italy rather than 1st Century Palestine).   This movie seems to be doing exactly what The Passion of the Christ did- telling a story which broadly appeals to Western Christianity (specifically, one that neither offends Evangelical nor Catholic sensibilities). And that's fine, but it is rather boring. I would like to see a movie that tells a more historically accurate version of Jesus (IE the radically anti-Roman, anti-elite Jewish Zealot who sought to create the Kingdom of God in this world).

2016-03-21T14:18:00,"MISSION OF JESUS CHRIST (PEACE BE UPON HIM)  Bismillahi Rahmani Raheem  The ‪#‎Salvation‬ which God Almighty Offered to the Children of Israel through His Chosen Servant Our Master Prophet Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) was not through his alleged claim of death on cross. The salvation was not offered by God through the so called death of Jesus Christ as a sacrifice in crucifixion. Rather, death (murder) or denial of Christ, which could possibly lead to his crucifixion, brings curse and disgrace to children of Israel, not Salvation at all. See John 8:21 Once more Jesus said to them, ""I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."" It is through accepting CHRIST and living according to his Teachings and complete Submission to the Will of God, which brings salvation. John 8:24 I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins."" So it is very clear that ""to believe in him and living by his Teachings Israelites will be saved"". Not through a Divine Pre-plan to sacrifice Christ on cross for the sins of mankind as an offering to fulfil the laws of Prophets and abolish the laws. Because abolishment of law is from Satan not from God. See 2 ‪#‎Thessalonians‬ 2:7-8-9 ""The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works"". ‪#‎Matthew‬ 13:41 The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness, One who understand the return of Christ to this world, will understand what we are saying. The old testament laws has its own requirements. There is no human sacrifice in it. Since Christ appointed as high priest and Prophet in the new Testament laws, it through accepting him as high priest and he becomes an intercessor (Waseela) for Jews and perform sacrifice at the Temple mount, he bring salvation to Jews. There is no laws in Old Testament which says to sacrifice of human for ‪#‎God‬. Some people bring up the incident of Prophet Abraham alaihiswalathu wa Salam and Ishmael (alaihissalam/Issac alaihissalam according to Jews and Christians) to justify this claim. But the truth is that there were no sacrifice of human then. Also it was not an atonement sacrifice which God Almighty ordered Prophet Abraham alaihissalam. It was only a trial for Prophet Abraham alaihissalam, to test his loyalty to God Almighty after receiving son in the old age. The old testament laws can't be fulfilled for whole world, because it is given to only children of Israel and those foreigners who reside among them. If Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) to be sacrificied Just to save Israelites, then the sacrifice has to be on the altar at the temple and high priest should perform it. Pagans (Romans) and Pharisees cannot be part of it. It was Sadducees who were high priests in that time. If Christ's (alaihissalam) covenant is a new covenant and have totally separated from old covenants, then it is a lie to say Christ is fulfilling old covenant. Because now it is new covenant that must be fulfilled.  So in the old covenant, only Aaron's descendants can be high priests and Jesus Christ peace be upon him not descendant of Aaron (Peace be upon them) rather he is on Melchizdek order, according to New Testament.  And there is no legitimacy to say that priest in ‪#‎Melchizdek‬ can become priest in the law of Torah. Therefore, it is in accordance with what Quran says about ‪#‎Jesus‬ ‪#‎Christ‬ (peace be upon him) is absolutely true words that will prevail over all other scriptures. Quran 4:157 That they said (in boast), ""We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah"";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:- ‪#‎Quran‬ 4:158 Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise. ‪#‎John‬ 8:22 This made the Jews ask, ""Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?"" John 8:23 But he continued, ""You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.

2016-04-11T02:31:34,"Look at this objectively.  Why would a man who was a fraud and liar be  remembered by so many 2000 years later?  Now look at the converse of  this hypothesis:  What if this man is who he said he was and did perform miracles that were witnessed by multitudes of people?  Also, what if as he promised, he busted out of his tomb after three days (with a Roman  military guard outside)?  That would definitely explain much......See  the movie and think about it.      Roman Soldiers guard the Tomb, Matthew 27:62-66    The Roman soldiers sealed the tomb. Then they stood guard for the next three days in four hour shifts of four soldiers each. How many Roman soldiers were there we do not know but it could have been as  many as 50 or more and also a number of soldiers from the temple guard  e.g. Jewish soldiers that worked at the Temple. The stone that closed the entrance was very large and was rolled in a  channel. This channel was sloped so it was easy to close but hard to  open.  Background Reading: The Guards at the Tomb Secure it 27:62 The following day (that is, after the Day of Preparation), the high priests and Pharisees gathered before Pilate 63 and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said while he was still alive, ‘I will be raised after three days.’ 64 Therefore, order the tomb to be secured until the third day, or his  disciples may go and steal him and then tell the people, ‘He has been  raised from the dead.’ Then the last deception would be worse than the  first one.” 65 Pilate told them, “You have a military guard. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how.” 66 So they went and secured the tomb by putting a seal on the stone in the presence of the guards. Matthew 27:62-66  More Information: These were regular Roman soldiers. A watch consisted of 4 soldiers  which was changed every four hours. They would die if their prisoner  escaped. These soldiers were not from the temple guard like the group  that came to imprison Jesus.",1,0,G Gibson,xxgm2TJr2m0,0.11483579638752052,2016-04-11 02:31:34,False,True
