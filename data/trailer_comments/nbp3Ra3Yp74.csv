Way to distract us with Electro when you really plan on bring in the whole SNISTER SIX! This is an amazing coalition of a bunch of stuff, and I can see already that its going to flow together greatly! This is what the Dark Knight Rises was trying to be in some ways. I love the Sony marvel movies and I don't think this will make me think differently except maybe for some CGI. The first movie made it seem to me like they were going to make the sinister six all humanoid things, like the rhino or vulture, but as we see here they took the technological path. I really think this is a more ""realistic"" take on Spiderman, somewhat. I mean we can now see how so many villains could sprout up at the same time thanks to Osborne. But I really don't know if their just setting the sinister six up here, putting out rhino and electro early, and then Gwen Stacy's death, and the introduction of the Osborne's, then they'll wait till a 3rd movie to fully establish the sinister six as a whole, but because they market this as his biggest battle ever suggest that they're going to take it full on. I'm so impressed with this trailer, I know I'm making a lot of preconceptions based on a trailer, but its quality and what it entails, I just feel sure that this is going to be a good superhero movie. Disney Marvel Movies and DC Movies, they try to make their movies into different genres: comedy, dark, scifi, fantasy, etc. But this truly feels like a SUPERHERO movie, they don't change the character to match a tone, they change themselves to match the character and their world. I'm usually not a big spidey fan, it's just that this is the first trailer, first anything, that seems it will be a full on action packed straight from the comics movie, but with its own modifications that I feel improve it, for example as I stated earlier, Osborne leading the sinister six. This just seems like it is going to get everything right and I'm super thankful for Sony because they aren't trying to sail tickets using goldilocks with abs or dark cloaks and inhumanly deep voices. What I mean is, their advertising Spiderman and his world, not the actors and producers who are in/made the movie.",0,0,GreenDotComics,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.14443521594684386,2013-12-06 04:14:42,True,True

Now on to the matter of Toby as Spidey, he played the nerd part fantastically so yes I give him props to that and honestly it was completely the director's fault in not making Spidey smarrt assy enough. I thoroughly enjoyed The 1st Amazing- Spiderman and this one looks even more AMAZING ;) hahaha and Im glad they are about to introduce the sinister six like on commenter said before me and yes SPOLIER ALERT like the other guy stated Stacy is supposed to die because Green Goblin throws her off a bridge and Spiderman shoots out webs to save her and the whiplash from the abrupt stop breaks her neck and she dies.¬†",0,0,FriendZone,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.09125,2013-12-06 08:21:33,True,True

I have  come here to reach you and share the good news of Jesus Christ with 1 comment.   1 Corinthians 15:20-22 KJV  But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.  Mathew 12:36-37  36But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.¬†37 For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.‚Äù  2 Timothy: 8-9  So don‚Äôt be ashamed of the testimony about the Lord or of me, his prisoner. Instead, share the suffering for the good news, depending on God‚Äôs power.¬†9¬†God is the one who saved and called us with a holy calling. This wasn‚Äôt based on what we have done, but it was based on his own purpose and grace that he gave us in Christ Jesus before time began.   Seek Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ has done nothing wrong to you and he loves you unconditionally. He pretty much handed you salvation in a silver platter and more. What he asks of you is easy and the rewards are great and instant.   Bless God and God Bless all who read this and may your hearts hunger to know him!

2013-12-06T11:08:30,"In the original Spider-Man movies, there was no real origin consistency. Peter was bitten by a mutated spider, Goblin was a psycho with uninspired Iron Man armor, Sandman was a freak lab mutation, Venmon an alien, and Octavius stuck with a machine gone wrong. But it seems like for this new universe of the Amazing Spider-Man series - at least from the trailer - they could be setting it up so that some sort of cybernetic/mutative basis behind each empowered villiain. Lizard's gene splicing gas shooter, Doc Ock's tentacles and Vulture's wings, Rhino's armor, even Goblin's jet and Spidey's decidedly non-organic web-shooters: this version of Spider-Man looks like it wants to mix tech AND evolution equally, with Electro maybe as the next quantum step. After that, the logical way to continue the story for the third movie would be creation of the Sinister Six with the full compliment of animalistic villains (add Scorpion, Chameleon, and maybe Shocker for comedy relief). Just one full movie that's straight up pretty much nothing but villain after villain beating down Spider-Man until he just can't get back up. If they establish a consistent origin, they can skip the tedious backstory that bored everybody with Sandman and just get into the action. They can limit that 3rd movie to 1 1/2 hrs if it's just Electro zapping while Vulture holds Aunt May hostage and Scorpion and Rhino rip up the city and Chameleon causes chaos all as a distraction while Dr. Octopus goes after the real prize and Spidey has to race from one end of Manhattan to the other just trying to hold things together.  Then for the 4th movie, continue the bio-tech theme with OzCorp trying creating the ultimate adaptive weapon - possibly utilizing Spidey's DNA (or at least Papa Parker's theories from the first film that Peter and Dr. Conners refined) to create the Venom symbiote. In fact, by waiting to introduce Harry until now, they can practically follow the Ultimate comics storyline, and maybe also set up a fifth movie by hinting that there were a bunch of failed clones of Peter in the process of trying to replicate his DNA for a Clone Saga movie (just imagine the love complications of Gwen Stacey AND Mary Jane who both think they're Peter's only girlfriend and are both right! Imagine it!).  Those are just ideas, Hollywood (but, seriously, I WILL give you that manuscript if you ask!). All I'm saying is that fans prefer a series that's internally consistent (if you don't believe me, google Prometheus), and that by sticking to a coherent set of rules rather than throwing in a new twists just to surprise and shock audiences, it's actually EASIER to write a good story. From the trailer it looks like they've got a good start.",0,0,thewiredslain,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.04215408048741382,2013-12-06 11:08:30,True,True

I mean 90% of the gross of people here will see this movie regardless of a 7 out of 10 preview or even no preview.  Can't wait to really dive into this new cinematic Universe Sony is trying to make. Will it beat Marvels? YOU decide.   And did anyone catch Doc Ocks Tentacles and Vultures Wings half way threw?  Hope they have a tiny nerdy fat man to play him. Haha Would be Awesome!

2013-12-06T19:12:38,"""Amazing"" is just a title change to differentiate THIS series from Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy. Just like ""Ang Lee's Hulk"" (2003)¬†and ""The Incredible Hulk"" reboot (2008). Marc Webb took some elements of ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" along with his own ideas and interpretations and used them to create the new universe for ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". Spider-Man 4 was going to happen, but Tobey Maguire had back problems, Kirsten Dunst didn't want to get her teeth fixed and Rami was pretty much done with the story he told. The series was good only because its what we grew up with. It was great for ITS time. Its 10 years later, YOU are not who you were 10 years ago, so why should Peter Parker/Spider-Man be any different? In the comics there are over 100 different dimensions and universes. Who is to say this isn't a different one all together? This wont be a ""Spider-Man 3"". The problem with that movie was that those 3 villains had no connection and no real reason to team up and Venom was not done justice. The comic books are easily able to adapt many characters and with the right direction and story, so can it be¬†on film. In this film, all of these villains have OsCorp in common. OsCorp is the common denominator, there is reason for these villains to exist. There is a reason why this¬†new series¬†is called ""The Spectacular Spider-Man in other countries. Has anyone seen the cartoon of the same name? It is the same plot! Bottom line, Spider-Man is Spider-Man and this is going to be a great film.",1,1,Blake Raines,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.23778138528138532,2013-12-06 19:12:38,True,True

2013-12-07T01:46:24,"The movie looks awesome from the trailer but I'm worried about a few things: 1) The posters seem to imply Harry Osborn will be the original Green Goblin. If that's true that's a gutsy and controversial choice that could potentially mess up the storyline if not handled carefully. 2) Electro seems to have a smaller role than we anticipated judging by the trailer. 3) 3 major villains in 1 movie? I hope Marc Webb plays this one REALLY carefully because that was a fatal flaw in Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3"" that helped fuck up the movie.  Given how many villains there are I expect at least 1 to die. I don't want it to be Electro, because he seems the most interesting of the 3 so far, but I have a feeling he's the most likely candidate. Rhino is a later villain and Green Goblin is a very important and pivotal villain for Spidey. He's too important to be offed in one movie shared with other villains taking up screentime. He would require a movie where he's Spidey's only villain before he's killed off, like Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man movie. Rhino is the villain I'd personally be least upset about dying.",14,2,A86,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.13129310344827586,2013-12-07 01:46:24,True,True

Audiences have been so hypotised by realistic special effects that all of a sudden if they try to make it look more comicbook-like or colourful it's shit? Nah. Thirdly, Electro and Rhino look fucking awesome and perfectly fit in to this universe that Marc Webb is creating. They're both based off their Ultimate Universe counterparts because their mainstream counterparts would just look ridiculous. Let's be realistic. And finally, those saying that Sony are just making this for the money are so damn naive it hurts. If you look up information and listen/read to what Marc Webb and his team are doing.

I think the only one that has handled multiple baddies well has been the more recent Christopher¬† Nolan vision of Batman. Just because it was sort of well managed into the story and not a ""hey, we have completely different goals, but lets join forces to kill the hero"" sort of plotline. The Tobey Maguire sequels are a great example of that. Why did the morally sound¬†Sand Man, who was only doing bad stuff for the sake of his family, join forces with Venom?¬†Just because.¬†Don't ask questions.¬†  So this movie is going to jam in¬†Electro, Rhino AND a Goblin? I have my doubts they will be able to present all of that in a way that doesn't just seem like a bad tradeoff between action and story. The way to make a good movie is to have the story drive the action, not the other way around....

2013-12-07T06:31:16,"This trailer looks awesome, now I could be just biased, because Spider-man is one of my favorite super heroes, but this looks so cool. It looks like they got the posing on point, the costume looks great, maybe the eyes are a lil too big or a lil strange looking at certain angles, but it‚Äôs the costume fans have been waiting for.  The CG looks good, a lil fake, but what are you expecting a real guy go out and perform these stunts? I understand people‚Äôs concern with cg and hey I wish a lot of people could actually do a performance like what is shown in real life, but I‚Äôm guessing the cg is still not 100%, since they have till May of next year of post production.  ¬†Tbh I didn‚Äôt really like Andrew Garfield in ASM, yes he has the look of a perfect Spider-man/Peter Parker, tall, skinny, lanky, with a little bit of muscle, but he was way to awkward for me and very quiet. I know Pete is an awkward guy, but he had friends, he wasn‚Äôt completely socially awkward. It looks like Andrew stepped his game up in this one.  I see a lot of people complaining about rhino, Rhino was a guy in a Mechanical suit in the Ultimate version in the comics¬† (which a lot of the movie costumes are based off of) but this does look a lil too transformerish for me. I guess I‚Äôll just have to wait and see. I also think they made him mechanical, because Sony doesn‚Äôt have the best cg artists around, they‚Äôre good, but not the best and the lizard in the last movie looked super fake, but it‚Äôs a fucking 7 ft. tall lizard, so I understand why it looked fake, but I think Sony should try and get the guys who do the Hulk in the Avengers movie, because that‚Äôs as real as a hulk in the movies is gonna get, unless they go back to body builders in green pant. So maybe it was easier for them to make him mechanical.  My other concern is Jamie Foxx, great actor, I enjoy a lot of movies he‚Äôs been in, but he seems too calm to be Electro, the Electro I know is crazy, loud and seems like a psychopath, I‚Äôm hoping they haven‚Äôt showed the best of him yet.",1,0,KickitwithDavid,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.1431329849012776,2013-12-07 06:31:16,True,True

Fantastic score, but that the only reason they now pulled him in for Spider-Man... Oh, not to mention going up against Danny Elfman (an overly hated but genius composer) his score.

The guy who loves and supports Aunt May, goes out of his way to help and support people, and has a severe case of the Parker Luck is ""nothing like the comic?"" Oh please. If anything I'd say he was closer (anything's closer than Peter helping you-know-who's death along in the last film and treating May like shit). There's a reason Spider-Man 1 and 2 are frequently on best comic book films of all time lists. Hating on things doesn't make you cool, it makes you pathetic.   To those hating on Andrew, ik the first movie really wasn't that great, and all my fellow comic fans will know that at times it was absolutely nothing like the Spidey we know. However, everyone deserves a second chance, and the first film DID have some good qualities to it, so let's not completely comdemn this film. If anything we can wait til we see reviews to decide whether it's worth it, but let's stop saying it sucks before it's even out.",0,0,nicksmi56,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.16500000000000004,2013-12-07 18:29:15,True,True

Didn't anyone learn from Spider-man 3 that it ruins the pacing of the movie? And it seems like a CGI actionfest (again that screams Sony to me). Everyone should look towards Spider-man 2 as an amazing blend of action and storytelling that stayed true to the flavor of the comics.

2013-12-08T07:12:27,"Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life and no man comes unto the Father but by me. The word (Jesus) was with God, The same was in ¬†the beginning with God. and was God. All things were made by Him and without Him, was not anything made that was made. John 1:1- 3 Jesus is not merely a prophet and He was never an angel nor a spirit being that was produced by God the Father having relations with a female deity as the Mormon church purports. Jesus or Yahshua is God. Yahshua means, Yah or Yahweh (Yah is the contraction form of Yahweh) is salvation or Yahweh saves. After Thomas, saw Jesus Christ risen from the dead, he said, My Lord and My God to Jesus (John 20:28). Jesus did not rebuke Thomas or attempt to stop him. Indeed, Jesus never rebuked anyone for worshiping Him. The Bible states that you are to worship, the LORD your God, and Him alone you shall serve. If Jesus was not God, He would have never allowed anyone to worship Him. Acts 20: 28 states: Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the whole flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of God which He (God) hath purchased with His own blood. Who shed His blood on the cross in order to redeem or purchase us? Jesus. Patently, this verse (Acts 20: 28) demonstrates that Jesus Christ is God! Jesus said that if ye have seen Me, ye have seen the Father and the Father and I are one. Because there is only God who is triune in nature.¬† The Father is Yahweh, the Son is Yahweh and the Holy Spirit is Yahweh. Genesis 19: 24 states: Then the LORD (Yahweh) rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD (Yahweh) out of heaven; In this Scripture we can obviously see that there are two Persons in two different locations who are called LORD (Yahweh). Furthermore, this is corroborated in Mathew 28: 19:   Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:  Notice: The aforementioned verse does not say baptize them in the names (plural), but in the name (singular). Because the Father is God (Yahweh), the Son is God (Yahweh), and the Holy Spirit is God is God (Yahweh).  Jesus was not merely a prophet, nor an angel, nor did He have a beginning. When Jesus said, before Abraham was, I AM, He boldly declared His deity. Jesus did not say before Abraham was, I was or I have been as the New World Translation erroneously prints, but before Abraham was, I AM ( ŒïŒ≥œâ ŒïŒπŒºŒπ ). John 8: 58 Afterwards those who were listening picked up stones to kill Him. Why? Because Jesus identified Himself as God. When Moses asked God (YAHWEH) Who shall I say sent me, God told Moses to tell his fellow Hebrews ¬†that I AM sent you. Exodus 3: 14  This is why Jesus Christ's suffering and death on the cross was such a tremendous sacrifice. The Creator (all things were made by Him) died for His creation. This is confirmed by the following verses.  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: Phil 2: 6 ¬†not robbery to be EQUAL WITH GOD! The only way one can be equal to God is if He is God. (The word was God ... Jesus is the word of God). ¬†Phl 2:7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:  ¬†Phl 2:8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. ¬†God, Himself- the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, came down as a man and died. God did not send down an angel or a pre-existent angel or spirit being that was produced by Him having relations with a female deity. As we saw earlier in Acts 20: 28 that God, (namely the Second Person of the Holy Trinity- Jesus Christ), purchased the church with His own blood. God the Son (Jesus Christ) came down as a man and shed His own blood to purchase the church (those who have received Christ as their Savior). Why would God pay such a tremendous price? Love! God is not willing (desiring) that anyone should perish (suffer in eternal torment in hell). For God so LOVED the world ¬†that He gave His only Son that whosoever (means anyone) ¬†believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3: 16 How does one receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior? Repeat the following prayer to God. Jesus, I ask you to forgive all of my sins, everything wrong that I have ever done, all wrong thoughts, wrong actions and wrong words and for not doing the things that I should have done or said. Forgive me. Come into my heart and live in me by your Spirit. Help me to know and turn away from that which displeases You. Help me to spend time with You in prayer and the Bible and to attend a Christian Church that Honors You and Your word. Help me to live for You as long as I live. Jesus thank You for forgiving all of my sins. Thank You that You now live in me. Amen If you have any questions, please leave a comment.

NOT about how many cool fight scenes our hero can have with the villains.  Love or hate Tobey and Kirsten... but there was CHARACTER in their relationship. There was even character in their first kiss... which has become an iconic image that these latest movies can't seem to top.",9,4,Luke M,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.034848484848484865,2013-12-08 09:23:00,True,True

You're paying to see big dumb Hollywood remakes (say what you will but all they did was change the villains around... same basic idea done worse but with more special effects and ""epicness"") of decent movies by Sam Raimi. Spiderman is NOT some big, epic saga like fucking Avengers (which itself isn't epic either, but...). Raimi captured the perfect atmosphere for Spiderman to be set in; it is a character story more than anything. Yet these movies just make Spiderman Generic Hollywood Action Hero # 235325 and put Generic Hollywood Villains against him with Generic Hollywood Attractive Love Interest and Generic Other Characters for good measure. There is no genuine creativity or heart behind any of this, just a bunch of Hollywood producers shoving in shit that dumb masses wanna see. Ask yourself: if this movie had NO computer effects at all, would it still be a ""good"" movie? Yes the Sam Raimi film had special effects but it was more about what went on BEHIND the fighting and WHY the fighting was done and not just Spiderman beating up Jamie Foxx in a shitty costume (a la Arnold Fuckhislastname as Mr. Freeze) because ACTION!  Fucking hate you people and your lack of wanting something better for yourself. All you do is shovel shit in your mouths and accept it as long as Hollywood sprinkles some sugar on top. Fuck that. This is entertainment at its basest and most trivial levels; if you pay to see this movie and are excited to see it, you are without a doubt a drooling moron. Sorry, that is fact. You can still want to see it but please download it for free... do NOT pay Sony to watch this schlock that looks and feels like a computer program put it together.

A closer look at images of the screen at :52 reveal Dr. Morbious file(Morbious from the comics, and the canon video game that came out with The 1st film already established Dr. Morbious as loving bats), A Dr. Connors file and a Venom Storage. We also see Harry entering into a lab area(Harry is rumored to become The Hobgoblin) as well so everything is in place for The Sinister Six. My guess is the 3rd film will feature Vulture and Doctor Octopus and will reveal Venom(who will get his own film to further his character.) All parties return for The 4th and final film which will feature The SInister Six with Venom, Hobgoblin, Morbious and Lizard helping Peter against The Sinister Six as at this point they realize just how much the world needs Spider-Man.

The biggest problem with this flick for me is ignoring the reason why peter does, what he does - ""with great power comes great responsibility"". Also canister shooters? - this was ret-conned in the amazing spider-man and even creator Stan Lee thought it was a no brainer(he even said that when he created him he didn't include the power to shoot web naturally, in order to focus the readers attention on peters' scientific skill that he will use through out the series), after all he did get super powers from a a spider bite.( by the way - I grew up reading the original spider-man comics and watching the fox-kids cartoon and never liked the web-canisters, so I'm not knocking it for no apparent reason. just never liked the fact that he didn't have the power to make the web naturally.)¬†",0,5,icenine135,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.2057291666666667,2013-12-10 15:51:51,True,True

My brother and i are in a debate also whether or not the sinister six is involved in this due to the six chambers in the trailer but I'm not sure if I'm totally convinced, its like its been fast tracked in the comic storyline but yeah i am so happy that they finally got his suit with his eyes right so that makes me happy enough.plus i'm not being racist whatsoever but now that its happened to Nick Fury its also happened to Electro now as he is a white man in the comics which isn't a bad thing i'm just a massive marvel fan and now hes black and i'm just tired of them changing it from the comics CANT WAIT though apart from that stuff it does look FARKING AWESOME!!!!",1,0,Spencer Banks,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.02148033126293997,2013-12-14 07:11:58,True,True

2013-12-18T16:57:16,"¬† Quran (2:244) - ""Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things."" ¬† Quran (2:216) - ""Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.""¬† Not only does this verse establish that violence can be virtuous, but it also contradicts the myth that fighting is intended only in self-defense, since the audience was obviously not under attack at the time.¬† From the Hadith, we know that this verse was narrated at a time that Muhammad was actually trying to motivate his people into raiding merchant caravans for loot. ¬† Quran (3:56) - ""As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help."" ¬† Quran (3:151) - ""Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority"".¬† This speaks directly of polytheists, yet it also includes Christians, since they believe in the Trinity (ie. what Muhammad incorrectly believed to be 'joining companions to Allah'). ¬† Quran (4:74) - ""Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.""¬† The martyrs of Islam are unlike the early Christians, led meekly to the slaughter.¬† These Muslims are killed in battle, as they attempt to inflict death and destruction for the cause of Allah.¬† Here is the theological basis for today's suicide bombers. ¬† Quran (4:76) - ""Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah‚Ä¶"" ¬† Quran (4:89) - ""They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks."" ¬† Quran (4:95) - ""Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward,-""¬† This passage criticizes ""peaceful"" Muslims who do not join in the violence, letting them know that they are less worthy in Allah's eyes.¬† It also demolishes the modern myth that ""Jihad"" doesn't mean holy war in the Quran, but rather a spiritual struggle.¬† Not only is the Arabic word used in this passage, but it is clearly not referring to anything spiritual, since the physically disabled are given exemption.¬† (The Hadith reveals the context of the passage to be in response to a blind man's protest that he is unable to engage in Jihad and this is reflected in other translations of the verse). ¬† Quran (4:104) - ""And be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy; if you suffer pain, then surely they (too) suffer pain as you suffer pain...""¬† Is pursuing an injured and retreating enemy really an act of self-defense? ¬† Quran (5:33) - ""The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement"" ¬† Quran (8:12) - ""I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them""¬† No reasonable person would interpret this to mean a spiritual struggle. ¬† Quran (8:15) - ""O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end."" ¬† Quran (8:39) - ""And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion should be only for Allah""¬† Some translations interpret ""fitna"" as ""persecution"", but the traditional understanding of this word is not supported by the historical context (See notes for¬† 2:293, also).¬† The Meccans were simply refusing Muhammad access to their city during Haj.¬† Other Muslims were allowed to travel there - just not as an armed group, since Muhammad had declared war on Mecca prior to his eviction.¬† The Meccans were also acting in defense of their religion, since it was Muhammad's intention to destroy their idols and establish Islam by force (which he later did).¬† Hence the critical part of this verse is to fight until ""religion is only for Allah"", meaning that the true justification of violence was the unbelief of the opposition.¬† According to the Sira (Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 324) Muhammad further explains that ""Allah must have no rivals."" ¬† Quran (8:57) - ""If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.""¬†¬† ¬† Quran (8:59-60) - ""And let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip (Allah's Purpose). Lo! they cannot escape.¬† Make ready for them all thou canst of (armed) force and of horses tethered, that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy."" ¬† Quran (8:65) - ""O Prophet, exhort the believers to fight..."" ¬† Quran (9:5) - ""So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.""¬† According to this verse, the best way of staying safe from Muslim violence is to convert to Islam (prayer (salat) and the poor tax (zakat) are among the religion's Five Pillars).¬† This popular claim that the Quran only inspires violence within the context of self-defense is seriously challenged by this passage as well, since the Muslims to whom it was written were obviously not under attack.¬† Had they been, then there would have been no waiting period (earlier verses make it a duty for Muslims to fight in self-defense, even during the sacred months).¬† The historical context is Mecca after the idolaters were subjugated by Muhammad and posed no threat.¬† Once the Muslims had the power, they violently evicted those unbelievers who would not convert. ¬† Quran (9:14) - ""Fight them, Allah will punish them by your hands and bring them to disgrace..."" ¬† Quran (9:20) - ""Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These are they who are triumphant.""¬† The Arabic word interpreted as ""striving"" in this verse is the same root as ""Jihad"".¬† The context is obviously holy war. ¬† Quran (9:29) - ""Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.""¬† ""People of the Book"" refers to Christians and Jews.¬† According to this verse, they are to be violently subjugated, with the sole justification being their religious status.¬† This was one of the final ""revelations"" from Allah and it set in motion the tenacious military expansion, in which Muhammad's companions managed to conquer two-thirds of the Christian world in the next 100 years.¬† Islam is intended to dominate all other people and faiths. ¬† Quran (9:30) - ""And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are turned away!"" ¬† Quran (9:38-39) - ""O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place.""¬† This is a warning to those who refuse to fight, that they will be punished with Hell. ¬† Quran (9:41) - ""Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but knew.""¬† See also the verse that follows (9:42) - ""If there had been immediate gain (in sight), and the journey easy, they would (all) without doubt have followed thee, but the distance was long, (and weighed) on them""¬† This contradicts the myth that Muslims are to fight only in self-defense, since the wording implies that battle will be waged a long distance from home (in another country and on Christian soil, in this case, according to the historians). ¬† Quran (9:73) - ""O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.""¬† Dehumanizing those who reject Islam, by reminding Muslims that they are merely firewood for Hell, makes it easier to justify slaughter.¬† It also explains why today's devout Muslims have little regard for those outside the faith. ¬† Quran (9:88) - ""But the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight with their wealth and their persons: for them are (all) good things: and it is they who will prosper."" ¬† Quran (9:111) - ""Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Quran: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme."" ¬† Quran (9:123) - ""O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness."" ¬† Quran (17:16) - ""And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter destruction.""¬† Note that the crime is moral transgression, and the punishment is ""utter destruction.""¬† (Before ordering the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden first issued Americans an invitation to Islam).¬† ¬† Quran (18:65-81) - This parable lays the theological groundwork for honor killings, in which a family member is murdered because they brought shame to the family, either through apostasy or perceived moral indiscretion.¬† The story (which is not found in any Jewish or Christian source) tells of Moses encountering a man with ""special knowledge"" who does things which don't seem to make sense on the surface, but are then justified according to later explanation.¬† One such action is to murder a youth for no apparent reason (74).¬† However, the wise man later explains that it was feared that the boy would ""grieve"" his parents by ""disobedience and ingratitude.""¬† He was killed so that Allah could provide them a 'better' son.¬† (Note: This is one reason why honor killing is sanctioned by Sharia.¬† Reliance of the Traveler (Umdat al-Saliq) says that punishment for murder is not applicable when a parent or grandparent kills their offspring (o.1.1-2).) ¬† Quran (21:44) - ""We gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them; See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will win?"" ¬† Quran (25:52) - ""Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness...""¬†¬† ""Strive against"" is Jihad - obviously not in the personal context.¬† It's also significant to point out that this is a Meccan verse. ¬† Quran (33:60-62) - ""If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and the alarmists in the city do not cease, We verily shall urge thee on against them, then they will be",0,0,Jim Richards,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.02272645900465449,2013-12-18 16:57:16,True,True

But it is just my opinion. Well.... maybe aside from the fact it had the Green Goblin (my favourite comic book villain ever) and J. Jonah Jameson who was done BRILLIANTLY by JK Simmons. But they're the only redeeming factors from a movie that has aged poorly. Spider-Man 2 however, is still awesome.

I don't think Marc is going to change the franchise much because in the original spiderman The lizard was the first villain and spiderman helped made him!!

2014-01-15T15:29:46,"Ok everyone..I think I have figured out how the movie is gona play out..Here it is:¬†  First Half of Film might be like this: ¬†Movie may start with Spidey chasing Rhino in the film to showcase how he has perfected his superpowers..saves Max Dillon on the way..¬†He graduates with Gwen..and still is with her despite his promise to Captain Stacy...¬†He visits Captain Stacy's grave or it could be Uncle Ben's grave to reflect on his responsibility/promise....¬†We see Max dillon being treated like a loser.... Spiderman probably encounters Rhino's threat again..this time around with his mechanical suit...Peter reunites with his old friend Harry osborn...Gets to learn some truth about his father Richard Parker through Oscorp...The reason why Peter maybe under surveillance by Oscorp could be because he is Richard Parker's son or they need his blood to cure Osborn's illness..Harry talks to a dying Norman Osborn about peter etc..Not sure how harry acquires a scar on his left cheekbone.. Peter eventually discovers a secret underground station in the subway as shown in the trailers...realises what Oscorp is going to do with Richard parker's research...I think the above scene could happen either in the middle or towards the end.. ¬† Middle of the film: I think this is where shit turns real..  Max Dillon gets into a freaky accident which renders him superhuman with electric powers..Times Square sequence starts...Spidey neutralises him...Electro probably gets taken by Oscorp and is held captive or maybe temporarily held there...This is probably where Harry actually meets him and negotiates with him to bring Peter's blood to cure Norman Osborn...Electro Escapes and probably is given the suit by Oscorp itself..Harry eventually takes the serum and tries on himself..which results in his mutation to green goblin..  Towards the End of the film: ¬†And now guys..people might ask whether Gwen dies in the movie...I personally think Gwen does not die in the movie...Here is why...the following clue might seem simple but it tells alot.. Observe the scene where Peter fires a web at Gwen's hand and makes a funny quip at her....Look particularly his suit and the condition they are...and compare it to the sequence in the trailer where he dodges the continuos attacks from Electro at the power-plant like place..and when he fights Harry Osborn....His suit actually has differences..His suit looks more damaged when he fights with Electro...Which means that the scene where peter fires a web to her hand, fighting Harry.. might possibly come before Spidey's suit damaged showdown with Electro...And secondly, Gwen's clothes seem to suggest that the scene particularly happens either before/after the Green Goblin fight...Also alot of people assume that the bit where Spiderman lands on a scaffolding and fires a web down with the gears and stuff...they think that it is the moment where he saves Gwen...I think this is wrong!...He maybe actually saving Harry Osborn..who probably gets knocked off from his glider and falls to his death..He may save Harry and send him to Ravencroft...This means that his showdown with electro at the powerplant place is the true climax of the film..this also serves to make Electro the main villain..And I think Gwen ¬†goes to London towards the end of the film..which will probably result in Peter meeting Mary Jane.. And this could probably mean that Gwen dies in the third film..  I could be wrong on this..but all other theories are welcomed..",2,0,RiddleWinter,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.028293650793650794,2014-01-15 15:29:46,True,True

This movie will suck I think.. Sam Raimi's version was waaaaay better - And BRING BACK Mary Jane guys... They're basing this movie on ULTIMATE spider man, but the movie it's called THE AMAZING spiderman it doesn't makes sense..Also judging by the trailer the electro battle with spiderman looks almost the same as the one on the Ultimate Spiderman videogame.. and even the spiderman eyes from the movie looks like the Ultimate ones..And James Franco played a much better Harry Osborn.The new one looks like he's EMO...

2014-03-04T17:44:09,"To all the people who do not like the new 'The Amazing Spider-Man' films... Tobey is gone, Classic Spidey is gone,¬†Sam Raimi and all of the old cast and crew are GONE! Listen i understand that some people do not like 'change' or just cannot handle it, when i first heard about these new 'The Amazing Spider-Man' films i was pissed, and i immediately told myself that the new cast and crew were gonna suck and that the films were gonna suck and i am assume you did also. I watched the first film and found it great to be honest and i also loved it. As much as i liked the Spiderman Trilogy 'The Amazing Spider-Man' in my mind just is so much better than Spiderman 1 and 3 (not 2 ofc). I realized this after i watched the new film with directors commentary and had interesting things pointed out to me. I am a guy who just loves realism (especially when it is a super hero film) the way Spiderman swings in the new films are a lot more realistic, the fact that he has web-shooters is awesome for me (it always bugged me in the trilogy films). I also like how Marc Webb is focusing more on a realistic swing style, example instead of just effortlessly swinging 'left' and 'right', Spidey may shoot a web on the top of a building and almost run along it making his way up and then excelling to jump and free-fall just to do the same to the parallel building. Marc Webb also mentioned wanting to just have a moment of 'original to the comic books and spider-man trilogy' style swinging, but he wanted it to be realistic, that was why the crane scene was in the last film. Also i find the soundtrack a lot more suiting and entertaining for this film, although i miss those awesome 2-4 minute kinda like 'what happened in the last film summary's' before the new film began from the 'Spiderman Trilogy'. But i have a problem with how Peter Parker is presented in the new films, 'A' he is kinda good looking so i do not understand how he is an outcast in high-school and he, to me looks like the kinda guy who would just fit right into a group of popular kids, 'B' he should of been wearing glasses right of the bat and not contacts and there should of been a bit more to do with Peter's Photography hobbies and not 'Skateboarding' -_- So i think Tobey did a heck of a lot of a better job with a believable Peter character. Although on a whole the new story/plot has to be the only thing that makes me want to watch 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' as it is more¬†intriguing than the story in the 'trilogy films' and focuses a lot more on Peter's Parents and what happened to them and more orientated on Oscorp. I want to see a much more interesting plot in the new film, more depth into Oscorp and it secrets, a better orientation with the villains as we know there are 2 and 1 let's say sub villain (i don't want another Spiderman 3, 24+ minutes of venom srsly!). I want to see Parker working for the Daily Bugle in this film and i want to see more of 'his' life and what he does, i want to see a bit more of a follow up to Uncle Ben's Death and His Parents. Also i just want to see Spidey with the avengers SONY! So to all the haters out there i advise you just give this film a chance, This film feels like it can only just get better at the moment and i think it is almost shaping up to be one of the best Spidey films yet (IN MY OPINION!).¬†",2,3,Opiziite_,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.37140918782709836,2014-03-04 17:44:09,True,True

2014-04-02T05:31:45,"Raimi fan boys let's get this straight. The most popular complaint is that The Amazing Spider-man is dark. The amazing spider-man was dark because you all forget Peter suffers from depression. He's a lonely guy all he has are his aunt, uncle, and if you include Harry who treats him as an old best friend but pays little attention to him. After he meets Gwen everything changes. He's not depressed anymore he feels alive and set on living through his uncles words ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Webb nailed the first one with the little details and the backstory on his past. Making me eager to watch how great the second will be. Raimi is a good director I'm not bashing him but he viewed Spider-man as more of an opera if that makes any sense. The biggest mistake was casting Tobey (Yes I said it start unliking this but let's be honest) I speak for many people when I say I never saw him as Spider-man. He was a bland weenie of a character. I never saw that as a 12 yr old boy but seeing the films now they bore the crap out of me. And I just shake my head at every ""joke"" that comes out of Tobey's mouth. To sum it up Raimi didn't make a Spider-man movie but a Raimi movie with Spider-man in it. I'm more than happy with this reboot.

They didn't portrait at all the charisma of spidey while figthing. The jokes were forced and lame.  Other than that it's an awesome movie, great music (there's a scene were Gwen and Peter get into a closet and they kiss but it's kind of odd because there's no music), special effects were f'ing cool and the 3D was spot on.

The Character development of Peter was interesting. The humor was incorporated well. Electro was a great Villain. Acting is enjoyable. Special effects and cinematography are brilliant.  Bad: (May contain spoilers) Harry Osbourn's transformation into becoming a Villain felt rushed. He should have been in the first film to establish his friendship with Peter. The movie just introduced us to Harry and then 3/4 in he discovers Peter's secret and then wants to kill him for not getting Peter's blood to cure himself etc. The Rhino shouldn't have been advertised because i'm sure most of us wanted more than a teaser at the end. Once again, his entrance felt rushed and I would have liked a small backstory for the person controlling the Machine. The plot behind Peter's father could have been explained in the first film to allow more time for action. The constant reminders of the film telling us that Peter and Gwen shouldn't be together because it puts her in danger even though they keep ignoring that kinda gives away her fate....

2014-05-03T07:48:09,"Horrible movie. Spoilers below, but this is my opinion: the logic behind the movie was poorly thought out, and this is my reasoning as to why the writing and movie was horrible, and there was no thought behind the characters except Electro. Dialogue was poor, too much Gwen and Peter, not enough fight scenes (they lasted about probably 20 minutes total for all scenes for a 2.5hr movie), and character development sucked.  Plot was based too much on the romance between Gwen and Peter Parker. Barely any fight scenes, no character development of Harry Osborn or Rhino. The Green Goblin is not supposed to look like a fucking GOBLIN!?!? Harry turned into a Goblin from taking the Spider Venom? How the hell does that make sense?! GREEN GOBLIN IS NOT AN ACTUAL LOOKING GOBLIN....The Green Goblin is a character who has enhanced powers from taking the ""Goblin Formula"", just like old Spiderman movie (with Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe), and he wears a MASK people?!!?!? Also Harry Osborn in this movie was a BIG GIGANTIC BABY, and in my opinion a wimp and gave up his manhood when he screams 'HELP ME! HELP ME! *CRIES HYSTERICALLY* I'M DYING, SAVE ME!!!!"" Then oh, he takes the venom, and finds the glider of the Green Goblin and then all of a sudden magically becomes the Green Goblin?!?! This was completely stupid, and why the hell does Oscorp own all of the machinery for Doc Oc, Rhino and Eagle...Harry Osborn yet alone Norman Osborn were not mob bosses in the comics, and they did not create those characters/villains. Oh and why all of a sudden Harry's 'GOBLIN' features all of a sudden disappear out of nowhere and he says 'they come and go' and there's no explanation whatsoever about this. They didn't even really explain what kind of hereditary disease him and his father had that was making them die.¬†  The whole story and writing of this movie was complete and utter disappointment, I've never been so let down from a movie. The only thing I give to them is that Electro was good, but there should've been more fight scenes with him, and CGI was amazing. Other than that, I think the movie budget was completely spent on CGI rather than the writing development and the logic behind the character development.

ASM2 had some epic music in there, but the contemporary songs like Steve Aoki's Pursuit of Happiness and that Phillip Phillips song didn't really fit too well in there.

2014-05-03T21:02:37,"I think the problem with modern comic book fans is that they expect the adaptions of there favorite comics to be flawless and 100% accurate to THEIR favorite individual story arcs. This Spiderman is an amalgamation of the original spiderman and the ultimate spiderman comics published back in 2001-02. Its not going to have the feel of the original 60s comics. Also I feel that some fans go into a movie expecting it to entertain them like the comic book would, and when it doesn't do so because watching a movie is a completely different experience than reading a comic book, they immediately pan it. Don't get me wrong, i am a huge comic book nerd and an even bigger fan of Spiderman. Its just when i go see movies like this, i don't judge it on if it is a good adaptation or comic book movie, i judge it based on its quality as a movie, period. If it entertains me and keeps me engaged, then its a good movie in my opinion. For example, i loved the first Amazing Spiderman film because it was a great summer MOVIE. The new Spiderman/Peter Parker (The Andrew Garfield one) made me laugh genuinely and he was entertaining, while as Toby Maguire (please correct me if i spelled it wrong), although he gave an excellent performance that in a lot of ways rivals Andrews, he did not entertain me as much as Andrew. Humor has been an essential part of the Spiderman mythos since the begining, and Garfield's portrayal of Spiderman embodied that more. My whole point in all of this is to say that moviegoers shouldn't judge a comic book movie to its print counter part. Its an unfair comparison and in my opinion at least , not a fair way to judge a movie like this. Of course, if you want to critic a movie like that, thats completely fine.  Needless to say, i do plan on seeing this movie, probably on monday. ",1,0,NEWGUY2015,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.24397634885439765,2014-05-03 21:02:37,False,True

2014-05-07T19:46:48,"It still amazes me that this movie got mixed reviews as it has, just shows how harder it is to please people now.  I think many people also went in with the mindset it was supposed to be the same edgy sequel the first one was, trying so hard to be dark and edgy (thanks Nolan). A criminal thing many superhero movies are doing of late and I'm glad the sequel felt like a Spider-Man movie again, I felt like I was finally watching a movie with the comic book wall crawler finally done justice. Making it colourful, delightful and fun over anything else. It felt like a proper family superhero film again, and that's why I loved it. It was being what Spider-Man is supposed to be, I could imagine kids watching this movie thinking the hero himself was well... amazing. It really shown how great of a role model Spider-Man is without constantly throwing it in your face like Man of Steel did.  I'm just relieved it wasn't as dark as the first one primarily though. But I'm genuinely surprised it's got mixed reviews. Whether it's from the amount of villains (which isn't even half as bad as it was in Spider-Man 3) or it simply not starring Tobey Maguire (which actual fans of the comics wouldn't give a shit about anyway since he was completely out of character to how Peter's character evolved) I still find people overbloating and overcriticising. I could imagine if this film came out 5 years or so earlier, it would've gotten critically acclaimed, people are just harder to please now and complain about absolutely everything.Ôªø",20,1,food wich,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.09229166666666667,2014-05-07 19:46:48,False,True

2014-05-08T22:50:03,"This movie felt so Hollywood it really bums me out. In a few years this film will be a faded memory because all this movie does is boast great graphics which will be 1-upped very quickly. The only parts of the film that feel authentic are parts between Gwen and Peter and that's likely only because Andrew and Emma are actually in a relationship outside of the film. The emotional scene where something terrible happens felt like the only part that really had effort put into it and the whole movie truly feels like it was just made to set up the next films. And if that continues, then each film will just be made to set up the next one. When will time be taken to actually make a good movie with a story that is well thought-out? Instead of weird script directions like Harry Osborn ""needing"" Electro to break back into the same building he was just in five minutes before that and could've grabbed the serum on his way out? And how Electro was treated, he had such a sad backstory and what the film ends up doing with his character just felt wrong. Plus that crazy ""doctor"" that treats Electro was so awkwardly over the top and not in a good way. I really wouldn't mind this film's flaws if it didn't feel like it was just a mess of footage thrown at the screen with animators working their tails off (and probably not getting paid enough) to make the fight scenes look good. But if people eat this movie up and think it's ""epic"" then I guess Hollywood will keep trying to make things easier for themselves because they know people will just eat it up because of how good something looks rather than how good something actually is. Maybe I'm just too old for these types of films since I'm 23 and grew up with the Sam Raimi films that had special effects as an effect rather than the focus of the films (the first two of Sam Raimi's anyway). This Amazing Spider Man movie had two or three good scenes but this just felt like a movie made fast and sold to the masses for how it looks and all the hype they've spent millions creating through advertising. Sony wins in the end I guess. I'll just go back into my hermit cave and watch Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 again.",1,1,Eddie Lopez,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.10794513457556937,2014-05-08 22:50:03,False,True

It is boring if every detail has to be explained. When you watch this movie just use your logic and be understandable. Dont complain too much like you know how to direct a movie or write scripts.

Hell to the fuck no, I think Andrew did a Way better job playing spider-man, When did Spidey ""fans"" known Spider-man to be a very serious character? (comics, Tv show, etc.) Never, He always had something wise cracking to say in the comics and TV shows. I like the fact how Dedicated to science in this one than the other predecessors, He wrote science equations on his skateboard in the first Amazing spider-man. He actually Built his web shooters, thus showing how Smart a average kid from Forrest hill, new york really is. And the fact that people complain about how much of a nerd He is not in the movie, This man BUILT web shooters and found a cure for Dr. Connors amputated arm, He resembles the more modern Peter Parker from the 616/Ultimate universes. Tobey fans claimed to represent the ""Classic peter Parker."" NEWSFLASH: Classic peter Parker (Even outside his witty spider-man persona) was still a joking and happy kind of guy. They tried to modernize peter Parker instead of copying from the predecessor, why? They used something called Source material, And actually put source material in the movie. So, I can complain less about the movie.

2014-07-07T13:11:34, The orginal trilogy was awful with exceptions from spiderman 2 but that movie.still had some really corny moments. The first spiderman was good and i.admit its a classic but it lacked backround info of how he got his powers and his parents. And i thought they did a terrible job on the green goblin. And i dnt understand at the end how he survived getting hit with a bomb????   Spiderman 2 was the best out of all.of them. But i didnt like how he lost his powers becuase it got to hard for him and became a weak corny nerd who wouldnt help somone getting robbed because hes.not spiderman anymore! And i thought is was stupid how he got his powers back becuase of mj. I mean rly what about the guy u just let get mugged?   Spiderman 3 was just terrible they tried to cram so much into it and it was just a mess. I liked how they tried to do venom but they shoulda just focused on him for the whole movie and.not make spiderman a emo guy wearing eye liner. I also didnt like how they got eric forman to play venom. I thought that fezz was just gonna pop outa no where along with the rest of the crew. And making sandman uncle bens real killer was just bad storytelling and a  way just to get another super villian. And there was just too much crying!  The amazing spiderman is the best spiderman movie out of all of them! They showed why peters parents left him with his ant and uncles. And showed how smart he rly was like in the comics such as making his web shooters. They also showed his sense of humor witch also goes back to  the comics witch in the sam ramis triogy really lacked of and when they did show it ir was really corny! They showed how his powers worked for him and had a pretty good backround on the lizard and what he was trying to do.  The amazing spiderman 2 was a good sequel but lacked alot.of backround info! It felt rushed and lacked alot lf backround info Such as harry coming out of no where and then all of a sudden turning into the green goblin in the last 15 min of the movie along with rhino witch they failed to do by making him a robot and having 2 min.of screen time! I also think that electo was good but his reasonings for turning bad was just poorly writtin and i felt like they were trying to hard to make max a nerd and a nobody! The fighting was amazing but i also think they killed gwen off to early and didnt rly explain wat had happend or what happend after she had died the next scene was her funeral.,0,0,Jamie Larson,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.026633738601823737,2014-07-07 13:11:34,False,True

The original spiderman movies did NOT go by the amazing spiderman comic book story line. If you have a problem with them being genuine to the story line ten times more genuine then the original movies then fine. You are still contributing to the movie. You are still watching the movies. The hate you are giving has no effect on the movies at all. I personally love these movies because they are being genuine. First off Spider-Man's first love was supposed to be Gwen how'd they do it in the original spiderman they made it Mary Jane he does not meet her till years after Gwen died. Just an example of how this is genuine to the comic books while the originals where not. So if you are not educated then don't try to act like you are.

2015-04-03T16:54:38,"My idea for the movie would have been that in the beginning, Norman Osborn hires Rhino as the Rhino to retrieve a few, for story purposes plutonium vials for him to create a super weapon that he intends to sell to a foreign buyer. Spider man, having known that Rhino has a mercenary like agenda, stops him and demands him to tell him who is his employer but Rhino refuses to tell and is sent to jail. Meanwhile the board of Oscorp become suspicious of what Norman Osborn is doing and plan to have him removed of the board of directors. Knowing that Spidey would become a threat to him as he recognises the spider DNA enhancements from the genetic spiders, Norman decides to inject himself with a serum and turns into the Goblin. Later Max Dillon falls into a tank of eels and turns into Electro where he heads to time square. During this time the board of directors remove Norman Osborne as CEO of Oscorp which forces Norman to return as the green goblin and kill the board of directors which is reported across New York but not before Spidey defeats Electro and imprisoned him in Ravenscroft.   With the buyer wanting the super weapon soon, Norman realises that he needs more money to continue so he robs a bank as the green goblin but flees after being defeated by Spidey. Knowing that Spidey is becoming a major problem and that after watching records of Electro in action Norman as the goblin frees him from Ravenscroft and forms an alliance-the same to rhino after freeing him from prison. Norman has finished building the weapon which is a biological bomb that can kill anyone within it's radius and after betraying his unknown buyer, the green goblin decides to use it on New York city while Rhino and Electro hold the entire city hostage to lure Spidey into a trap. Spidey falls for it and is overwhelmed by the three villains but Gwen arrives to help (like in the movie).   There she and Spidey work together to take down both Electro and Rhino in which electro is grounded and rhino dies. Gwen attempts to stop the bomb from being deployed but is captured by the goblin. The goblin finally lures Spidey to the clock tower and the two fight brutally while Gwen dangles below. Spidey  finally stops the bomb from going off while goblin throws a hail of pumpkin bombs at him.  Spidey slings them back with a web net killing Norman Osborn while Gwen falls down. Since I brutally hate Mary Jane Watson, Spidey saves Gwen from her death. Harry learning that Spidey killed his dad, breaks out Electro where he explains he wants four other guys to help them kill Spidey. The movie ends with Electro saying let's go catch a spider.  Notes:  The plot from the first movie never happened, it is completely different. This is just an idea. Harry was there during the final battle. And the only subplot is Gwen and Peter's relationship. Like I said this how I wanted the movie to go like. Oh yeah in the third one I came up with, Peter dies in Gwen's arms from Harry's sinister six with Aunt May finding out Peter's secret identity as well. this establishes Miles Morales becoming the next Spidey in which it ends with a spider from Harry's Oz formula biting Miles on the hand with him saying ""Oh no""",9,1,SilverWave Productions,nbp3Ra3Yp74,-0.03642676767676768,2015-04-03 16:54:38,False,False

Another thing that was disappointing was the supporting characters like Harry Osborn, Norman, Max. I hate that Harry wasn't in the first film so when they introduced him in this movie they try to make you feel like him and Peter have been bff's forever but it didn't work. And finally the villains were terrible, they made the same mistake spiderman 3 made with TOO MANY VILLIANS. Electro wasn't all that bad but his motivations were so stupid, Green goblin looked so bad he looked like he had face herpes and rhino was a fucking joke.

2020-05-03T01:49:24,"The movie turns 6 today! still my #1 movie of 2014; it feels like they went back to the colorful fun tone of the Raimi trilogy, that 2012 movie was too much like Batman and almost made me officially give up wanting to see this character on the screen again thank god they got back on track this time around; the suit feels more like it was right out of the pages of the comic, the POV swinging shots are incredible, my dad loved being a part of the action which is amazing to look at, the chemistry between Garfield and Stone is the highlight of the movie and considering it's all leading to her death it makes it that much more impactful,  keep in mind there's a lot of themes and foreshadowing of time being precious and how little of it we have not to mention the sins of the fathers follow to our children think about how the fight on the plane with Richard Parker mirrors the fight in the clock tower between Peter and Harry Electro looks terrific trust me that yellow and green suit would've been laughable if they did that version yet his character seems very secondary I like Dane Dehaan as Harry you buy their friendship when you first see them together, pretty much everyone calls him a young Leonardo DiCaprio  still shocked they managed to cram so much material in 2 and a half hours although i do wish they made the other installments but I am happy they wrapped up the parents' storyline I'm still anxious to see the Sinister Six on screen if they ever get around to it just remember Batman & Robin was already dead on arrival, if this one was so bad then why wasn't it boycotted?  they went all out with the merchandise on this one, too, it was truly the most advertised movie of 2014 the bad about this movie to me; it should've been longer to flesh everything else out, Rhino should've been in the movie more as well as Black Cat plus there was so much footage cut from those trailers that I would've loved to see inserted back in that alternate ending with Peter's father coming back was rightfully cut despite some great acting on Garfield's part it stinks too they had Shailene Woodley to shoot scenes as Mary Jane but they ended up omitting all of them I was never a fan of Spider-Man's jokes or one-liners, like come on start taking your job seriously people's lives are in danger! Harry slowly became a villain throughout the course of this movie because he was desperate to ask for Spider-Man's help and he took extreme measures when he was denied therefore feeling betrayed that dark guy in the hat is actually Gustav Feers, he's from a series of Sinister Six novels which in fact Marvel has officially disavowed  Colm Feore as Menken was actually lurking in the background this whole time if you pay attention since Oscorp is more concerned about their stocks and hiding their genetic experiments from the public, they just wanted Harry out of the way by framing him that way they could be in charge yes a lot of people complain they made another Spider-Man 3 with this one but keep in mind that movie still gets a pass and it made a ton of money breaking box office records, if it's still hated by so many fans how come no one acts like it never existed? I still love the trilogy and this one too because they feel colorful, fun, action-packed, filled with enough drama, and have a collection of really good actors Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse is really fun and entertaining but overall it still feels like a kids movie the MCU Spider-Man movies have yet to still impress me hugely cause it's hard to top that 2002 movie which started something so monumental for the genre Amazing Spider-Man 2 the worst Spider-Man movie? HELL NO! I have yet to see one that actually fails spectacularly still skipping that 2012 movie like the plague",0,0,J,nbp3Ra3Yp74,0.07792631917631918,2020-05-03 01:49:24,False,False

2020-05-15T07:11:03,"Yess im very agree with you. I mean, andrew such an amazing actor that really fits the spidey its self. Spidey is used to be mature guy with sad story behind, and fight hard to protect the city. We all know in the comic, spidey was one of dark heros story. Spiderman homecoming is too childish. Too young to encounter the danger. We know that spidey knowns as ""friendly neighbourhood"". But its doesnt mean to play spidey with child actor. Im really sad with that spidey homecoming. Andrew really fits enough to be spiderman. And his relationship with gwen, its really serious and complicated but its fits well enough with the story. With all the 3 series of spiderman, this is what i got so far:  1. ""Spiderman"" tobey maguire is too old for spiderman. Too formal. Not flexible. We dont have enough jokes in this series. As we know that spidey always disarm enemies with jokes. 2. ""The Amazing Spiderman"" like i said, Andrew garfield was such an amazing actor. His charisma is making us feel like, ""this is spiderman should be"". He knows to tell a jokes, we can see so much pain and pressure that really struggle spidey in this series. And after all that, we can still enjoy andrew as peter parker as spiderman as your friendly neighbourhood. This is the most spiderman series should be. Its not too adult, and its not too childish. 3. ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" yeah i know a lot of people still like this movie. Tom holland really make a good job in this series. His jokes still make us comfort with his performance as spidey. But, i dont feel this series maximize the spidey. I dont get the feel. For me, this series its too childish.  And in this the amazing spiderman series, we can enjoy his movement while swinging a web spiders in the town. Its amazing and like andrew does. This is the best and well performance ever.
