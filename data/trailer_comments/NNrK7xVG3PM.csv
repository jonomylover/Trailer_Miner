I don't see Ms. Delevigne's track record as an actress as any better or worse than Zoe Saldana, so her presence in this film doesn't bother me at all (just as the mostly-meh Ms. Saldana's presence didn't bother me in Guardians or any of the Star Trek films). And Luc Besson is a far and away more talented director than James Gunn could ever hope to be; plus he's not shackled to Marvel Studios asshole producers, and thus the potential for a more creative film is quite high here.

2016-11-13T15:33:07,"Valerian is the 1967 french comic book that started it all. As Mezi√®re (one of the two creators of Valerian) said : "" Before us, nobody had told story like this, everything was possible in the series, each new album could lead us absolutely anywhere we wanted to go."" The seminal work of Mezi√®re and Christin and all of the french artists at Metal Hurlant (Heavy Metal magazine) was for a long time a major source of inspiration for a lot of movie directors, like Ridley Scott, George Miller, James Cameron and George Lucas. Starwars is a ""tribute"" (some people says ""rip off"") to Valerian, there are literally dozens of shots from all the episodes that came frome the strips of Valerian. The Millenium Falcon is a copy from the Valerian and Laureline spaceship, some of the alien races in starwars came from Valerian, and there are a lot of similitudes in the two universe ( the carbonite of han solo, the cantina, the clothes of the characters etc etc) . This is maybe not so bad because all these artists were sharing the same counter-culture at that time, but Mezi√®re was really upset about it and wrote some letters to Lucas after starwars was released.  This Valerian movie is not a rip off of anything like mass effects, starwars , Guardians of the Galaxy, Avatar or John Carter. It is made as a tribute to the comics that made space opera the way it is in many film and games today. Luc Besson (director) asked Mezi√®re if he had been credited for Star Wars and Mezi√®re answered no. This is one of the many reason why the Valerian movie exists today. Luc Besson and Jean-Claude Mezi√®re have already worked together on the Fifth Element, Mezi√®re was the art director of the movie with Moebius and Valerian is the most massive and expensive movie ever made in France.   Will it be a great movie regarding of the source material and the budget ?

First of all before I go further with the review, you need to know that this film is based on comic book, which means is more suitable for youngsters. I'm 41 years old and I liked it. Why I liked it? Because of the stunning script, adventurous story, visual effects, thousands of alien characters and species, unpredictable scenes, the introduction of the film where it tells you how Alfa city was created, and finally the creativity of Luc Besson to show different dimension of the future. This film is not about dialog or super acting. You don't need that in this film, this is an adventurous film set in the future based on comic book.
