2015-03-28T04:02:49,"full review on IT FOLLOWS: I am very harsh on horror movies because i am sick of the same old crap. I can truly say that I enjoyed and loved ""it follows"" it was original, fun and horrifying in its own way. It relied on what every horror movie should rely on. Fear. I saw maybe about 2 scenes with blood and that was only little bits of blood on them. It pulled off good horror without blood because good horror movies should not rely on blood. It doesnt deliver a scare. It follows also wasnt too predictable. Some parts were. But for the most part I was not sure how the ending played out. It did play out very nicely. About a little before halfway through the movie i started to think i was gonna be extremely disappointed after anticipating it for so long, but I didn't. I loved the cinematography, I loved the plot, I loved the horror, I enjoyed especially how much character development they did. They actually built up their characters which is respectable and amazing and something I truly look for in a horror movie. The characters were also relatable and not too dumb. One or two scenes you can easily say ""Are you stupid?"" but for the most part they stay pretty smart about it. I truly also thought the ending was phenomenal. Will not spoil it, but it was chilling. Above all I enjoyed how they put the characters having real conversations and carried on things that didnt sound too scripted. They kept it natural and didnt over exaggerate on the situation, not did they not care at all. The writing was such a high point. Another one of the highpoints is the soundtrack. I loved the music in this. It reminded me of an old horror film. The only real problems i can think of is there are a few awkward crossfades in the editing and there were a couple actors that just didnt seem to care. It seemed scripted for maybe one or two characters. overall i give ""It follows"" a 9.5/10 smile emoticon",0,0,Zach Grossman,HkZYbOH0ujw,0.13251515151515153,2015-03-28 04:02:49,False,True

Unlike most modern horror movies where there are jump scares constantly, this movie had none, and if they did, they were hardly noticeable. The movie in general isn't terrifying, but it's very creepy and it leaves you feeling... Well creeped out. The reason behind this is because it's based off the director's series of dreams that he had in his sleep. And to see someone's dreams come to an actual film, well that's just one of the creepiest things I can think of.

Its so good and scary because unlike the other horror movies out there that just have graphic scenes and numerous jump scares this is different, because ""It"" cant run, it cant shoot you, it can only walk and follow you an even if you pass it on to someone else it can still come back to you and you NEVER know when! You know the tense music that builds up to a jump scare or the scary silence that builds up to a jump scare in movies well this movie is basically that tension the whole entire movie keeping you waiting and wondering where ""it"" is instead of just doing a bunch of jump scares, it is absolutely brilliant and so creepy!

Theres little to no real dialogue, no actual plot, no explanation of anything in even the slightest bit. the entire time, i was just waiting for something more to happen. I am still shocked as to how this movie got ANY praise whatsoever. As soon as it ended, i couldnt help but yell ""what??!!!

The direction was great. Many of the camera shots were extremely effective. Also the thought of some unstoppable entity relentlessly pursuing you is great for horror. It's one of my favorite cliches ;-). That's one of the reasons why something like the Terminator or Ju-On is so fun to watch.  BTW, I also learned some things whilst watching the film. 1.Be VERY careful who you boink. Otherwise you could find your genitals lojacked by some demon/ghosty creature. Then it's like syphilis crossed with the Terminator. 2. Small electrics will not kill you if you throw them in a pool while swimming. Always wanted to swim with my TV. Can't wait to try!!! 3.

2015-06-23T07:55:40,"I hate how underestimated this movie is by a lot of people. There's a reason why Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 96%, ladies and gentlemen.   First of all, this movie has the creepiest soundtrack I have ever heard in my entire life. I'm not joking, this soundtrack is like what you can only hear if you're living in the 90s. Extremely spine-chilling if you're at the theater.   Second of all, this movie has obvious educative messages and HIV/AIDS awareness undertones. The characters must have sex in order to rid themselves off the curse, but they'll pass it on to someone else and feel guilty about it. It's like the reality: teens having unprotected sex and getting STDs and transferring them to next partner.. Even more terrifying that being haunted. Aside from that, did you notice the scene in which Jay sits in class and the teacher reads one of T.S.Elliot's works: ""The Love Song of J.Alfred Prufrock?"" And that scene when Yara reads two passages from Fyodor Dostoevsky's ""The Idiot""? Those passages are about the imminence of death and how people fail at postponing their end.   Third of all, the antagonist of the movie. ""It."" It is not a human, it is a malicious entity that apparently just kills. Oh, shape-shifting is its hobby too. So the point here is, the entity isn't a gruesome, hideous devil. IT is just the embodiment of our fear. IT is always two steps behind us, watching us, waiting to catch up... Ever had a feeling of being followed? That's what IT is all about. The antagonist plans to strike in that same fear of yours and maximize it. We are afraid of it, so we run, but it follows, and it never stops, like how our fear will hardly ever leave us.   That's your part, but as for Jay, well, she's gonna suffer forever. IT just keeps following you and you just have to keep running, but it will catch up to you and then you'll die. Even if you pass it on, the other victims won't survive forever, and it will come back to you, and you'll have to keep doing it over and over again. And you'll still end up dead.   => So what's this movie about? Much like Oculus and The Babadook (brilliant things,) it tries to strike into your fear. Imagine, you wake up in the morning, gaze out the window and find a stranger staring unblinkingly at you, always trying to come closer until it can stand next to your bed and watch you sleep. You can't trust anyone, because it can be everyone. Hear knocks on the door? Maybe it's IT, maybe it's not. You can't be sure. Hear strange sounds around the house at night? What if that's IT walking to you? You are never safe. Always watched, always followed, always vulnerable to death. Pass it on, and you still see it. It will come back one day. You'll never be at peace.   Let that soak in. ",514,27,Chris Huy Nguyen,HkZYbOH0ujw,-0.11226851851851853,2015-06-23 07:55:40,False,False

2015-07-17T09:49:04,"Please, do not buy into IMDB or these comments. I have no idea what people are smoking, but if you want a horror film - this isn't it. It's not even a thriller. You want story? Doesn't have it. STD is as far as you'll guess. You want action? Go watch some specialized horror, because the only horror here is the sudden and completely unreasonable transformation and the sucked up impression that something bad is about to happen... but it never really does. You want jump scares? Oh, them you'll get here. That's probably as far as this movie could deliver. Seriously, the locking inside of the room and the ball to the window are probably the only two ""scary"" moments in the movie, and all because of the jump effect. You want reason? Not happening. ""It"" will be toyed with like some Alien. It has super strength, it is afraid of doorknobs, it is susceptible physically, it ""respawns"".  Now, certainly, if you want a cheap, I repeat - CHEAP horror to watch in the afternoon, most likely intoxicated and not really giving a flying fuck - by all means, enjoy. And that is not an offense towards you or the movie - just a plausible suggestion. It's indie and it's simple. It might deliver some shivers, some unease, but by the end of it you'll just wonder - what the fuck was it all for. The cliffhanger will totally ruin anything this movie tried to build up. So it's not the worst possible horror, not worse than some Leprechaun. But it by no means is a breakthrough or genius or any sort of impressive in the genre.

To me it was pretty boring, nothing much happened in the movie and the trailer has most of the scary moments, so it would affect you and get you to watch it. I personally didn't get scared and the creature looked to me like it was pulled of some fantasy movie and sure if you're younger or scared of those kind of creatures then this movie will be scary to you, but as for me and most of the horror movie watchers it was boring, sure the concept was quite original, but it doesn't make the whole movie or make it good.

My other favorite scene is when jay saw the old woman in her school for the first time.  But this movie had some stupid, dumbshit scenes in it, like frank and his mom fucking, or when jay swam out to those guys on a boat and presumably fucked all of them at once. Or when jays dad was the thing and he was throwing fucking toasters and type wrighters and fucking stero surround systems.Or the fact that this movie was okay with statutory rape.  Or that no ones age is actually shown or told threw out the story. It was hard to tell if the cast was supposed to be in highschool or college, because the characters mention several times them being places and doing things that only college age or older people would be able to get access to. Yet they all live at home and are deeply ingrained in neighborhood drama and are all pretty well connected.   And then to top it all off after being a major skank and having nothing to show for it as everyone she fucked eventually ended up dead. When she did fuck Paul, The kid who's been trying to hit the whole fucking movie ""to save her because she should trust him"", and he just accepts it and goes out and gets a hooker (presumably considering there wasn't a scene for it, just him driving slowly past some prostitutes) One last thing that bugs me a whole lot, is that everyone knows whose fucking who, and everyone is just okay with the situation. The directors just assumed that the audience would understand the story completely. Play. by. Play I'd give it a 4 out of 10.

I also thought it was a metaphor for herpes. Because when people have it, they can’t get rid of it.

2019-09-25T03:54:55,"2 things,..it was filmed in Detroit , I had rental properties there decade ago (bad idea) but the squatter home the first guy rented that was trashed is pretty common as well as the almost lost apocalyptic industrial scenes which are mostly old auto factories that are all over.  2, for those that hated it u may. Or be aware it's based off an urban legend.  So if it didn't make sense, maybe that's why.  The urban legend says IT is a demon , that's why most can't see it, and IT has been around since the dawn of man, originating in the first sexual sin of man. SO been around and chasing for thousands and thousands of years.  Goes way deeper but just FYI lol.   Born and raised in ""happy valley"" utah I went at 19 on a church mission to Detroit.  Lol culture shock for sure but LOVED IT!  Don't buy rental homes there tho! Sure you could get a beautiful post WWII brick bungalow for $5,000 in 2009,..but the 3 homes I owned I couldn't get rent from utah even with a property manager, all 3. Homes stopped paying rent after I gave Christmas and January off as a gift and they never paid again and I couldn't get them evicted because Wayne county is too far behind (or was) then when finally did the tenants dumped concrete mix down the toilets and sinks and basement floor drain,..$40,000 a piece to fix,gave them back to Detroit lol.  One of them burnt the home down when evicted.  Moral of the story , don't buy rentals in Detroit.  But seriously loved it there, went back to architecture school at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and lived in south Detroit and loved it.  It gets a bad wrap with I Jsut added to but truly some of the most amazing people on earth there despite my shitty rental experience lol",0,0,The Architect,HkZYbOH0ujw,0.23024691358024693,2019-09-25 03:54:55,False,False

2020-01-22T22:48:09,"I've heard a lot of theories about this movie and what the demon is supposed to be... none of them really make sense though. I'm pretty sure that at face value it simply is what it appears to be, a sexually transmitted demon that is invisible to others but can interact with our world and other people. If we are going to delve deeper into analogy though, I feel like a good case could be made that the demon represents death, as it slowly follows you throughout life. You're aware it's there and you spend your entire life running from it, but you know that eventually it will catch up to you. The poem that the girl with glasses reads at the end is reflective of this. One can go even further and point out that what is happening to the protagonist is a type of existential anxiety and depression. Others around her don't seem to see the same 'demon' she can, because they are oblivious to it. I feel that the way everyone else in the movie including the mother, police officer, nurses and teachers are portrayed as very distant and inconsequential to the plot represents how people with depression/major anxiety feel isolated from everyone around them. Only the protagonist and her friends seem to be affected by it, and each of her friends are dismissive of her problem to different degree's. The mother is especially interesting; we typically see her drinking or chatting with her friends about her daughter but we never really see her talk to her. I know it's not a perfect analogy, but I find looking at this movie thru that lens makes it very interesting, and the unfeeling, heartless and seemingly purposeless path of destruction the demon slowly inflicts on it's victims is very much like death.",1,0,Sax and Phone,HkZYbOH0ujw,0.12219696969696967,2020-01-22 22:48:09,False,False
