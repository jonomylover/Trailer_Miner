However, you would assume that the depiction of it by Hollywood would be down to the detail since we have all the ATC tapes.  It would have been clearly possible for Hanks to use the exact same words as Sully used in the cockpit, but the script varies from it.  I've only seen the trailer of a couple of minutes and there are a number of mistakes, the most glaring of which is that in the movie,  ATC clears them for takeoff on the wrong runway at LGA, runway 4.  In fact they were cleared for and took off on runway 31.  Other documentaries have it right.  One wonders how they got that wrong especially since Sully was there to correct them.

This Friday, prepare for Tom Hanks at his most Tom Hanksy as he lands a plane in a river, then talks and scowls. Experience the nail-biting suspense as everyone is saved. Hang onto the edge of your seat as Tom Hanks is given medals and national adulation. See Laura Linney as the prop, I mean, as the generic wife. This Friday, continue to wait for ""Rogue One,"" ""Silence,"" ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" and ""Manchester By The Sea.""",6,0,Hellzyead,6Tbkbx4Hz8Q,0.046875,2016-09-07 18:49:07,False,True
