And It‚Äôs just one of my fav films, it‚Äôs just one of those films where I plan not watching them by watching just the trailer, but she actually watching the film it‚Äôs better, But here‚Äôs the results  7. 8 / 10 for me and my guys  This film slightly deserves a small rate boost up.   I hope we get another sequel. if so, then hopefully rocket learn about the first 2 films and what they got out of em, making so people are liking it rather than throwing hate shit at it.  However! - Sorry Sherlock Holmes, but I‚Äôm gonna have to throw a ‚Äúshit‚Äù ornament at you, because the trailer is just showing a bunch of shit that isn‚Äôt in the film at all, there is a couple, but things like one of the goons saying the fertiliser, are not even shown in the film, but I wish they kept a scene with Sherlock and Benny, probably would be cringey, but just imagine that. But I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm gonna have to give the trailer a   4.2 / 10 - Trailer  7.8 / 10 - Film - I‚Äôm pretty sure a lot hated this because of the trailer itself and not the film, possibly the dabbing gnome must of triggered a few emotional bones for the viewers, I don‚Äôt care what a film shows, unless it‚Äôs the floss dance -_-",0,0,Spooky Peek-a-Boo,UtbiOl506ms,-0.06944444444444443,2019-03-13 01:15:53,False,False
