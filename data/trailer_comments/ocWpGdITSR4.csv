Unexpected, but I'm VERY excited for this. Hope it doesn't disappoint me like Beauty and the Beast did (wow, that was bad; even the previews had me groaning). But am I worried about the inclusion of the new characters (or the absence of Timothy or any sign of the other disgruntled elephants)?   Not particularly. Obviously nothing can touch the classic in the purity of its powerful storytelling, but this movie doesn't look like it's trying to deliver the same movie. It looks like it's trying something completely new. And I'd much rather judge a preview by what it is, than what it isn't -- especially when it's clear it's not TRYING to be a literal repackaging of an animated story comprised predominantly of talking animals -- obligatory (and dare I say, nearly mandatory) nods to the classic film's more poignant moments aside.  Here's hoping for the best. Tim Burton movies can be a very mixed bag, but this one looks pretty promising, in my opinion.

Now that I'm a bit older and know the cruel reality of the world, I know things like this actually happen in real life. Elephants, and tonnes of other animals, are seperated from their Mother's regularly for the circus and many other industries and are mistreated, not in all of the industries, but I imagine most. It's sad to think about now that I understand more about the realities of the world. This trailer made me cry. Looks like such a sad film, but portrays very strong messages about how we treat animals in the world today. Hopefully changes for the better come for animals from films like this.

I thought it was quite sad and felt sick to my stomach when Disney produced this and released the trailer, the original Book was actually based on a real living and surviving life of a young vaudevillian Elephant who was each night tied to a heavy metal frame(mounted above the Main Stage) and was swung around like a huge pinata and working the crowd into a frenzie who then tried to hit him with Bats. Also, they threw there Popcorn rich excrement just to add more humiliation, his ears were held outwards with steel rods¬† which dug into his soft ear flesh and as he spun he would shiver and urinate in fear only to be whipped by the Ringmaster....very,very sad.
