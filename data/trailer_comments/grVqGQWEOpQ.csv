2014-08-05T17:09:30,"This is one of the best written and executed horror films I've seen in a long time! Instead of the normal regurgitated and bland curve of story telling that's found in horror films now (all about shock and awe, jumps, and how gory it can get. There's no lasting substance), this film takes a return to real story telling. It's also a psychological thriller just as much as it is a horror film and both aspects are pretty strong at the right times.  You have to pay attention to this movie to know what's going on, and when it's a reenactment of the past or actually the present, because they correlate. You have an understandable, yet mysterious antagonist, strong plot, good acting, and a sickening yet satisfying twist to the end of the film. It's not the best horror film ever, but if you're looking for a solid and mature story line, and a horror film that isn't all about pointless jumps and endless gore where you have to think sometimes, this is the film for you. Oh and it does have some good jump scenes too! When it's scary, it does a good job and it's progressive in occurrence!  The ONLY thing I can honestly maybe criticize is the fact that this film, in concept, is VERY similar to the 2008 film ""Mirrors"". The basic identity of the antagonist is that it's a haunted mirror, or a supernatural being choosing to reside within the mirror. Other than that, it's actually quite a bit different. You can't really hold that against them though, this is a world where there is nothing new under the sun! EVERYTHING has been done before somewhere, so you can only be so original these days and they did a great job of hitting that mark.",20,1,Kody Pelton,grVqGQWEOpQ,0.15322227375798805,2014-08-05 17:09:30,False,False
