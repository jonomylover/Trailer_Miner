Especially being that most people can easily be convinced by 'authority figures' that another person (not them) is crooked and needs to be either killed or brought to them (authority figures). Yes, she can take off her Police Shirt and that would probably help to some extent (and it would be better than nothing) but she'd also be taking a chance on whether or not anyone who HASN'T been turned against her would believe her that she's an actual police offer who needs help (because some people do think more highly of Cops than others and would immediately come to her aid knowing she in dire need of assistance). **_That was a long way to go to lay out what possibly could be her circumstances but..
