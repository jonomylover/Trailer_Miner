Some liked it while die hard fans thought it was incoherent ... Now I am going to come out and say that I am not a huge Star Trek fan and yes I do prefer the Star Wars films , But what JJ Abrams did when he was asked to do a reboot of the series he made it appeal and loved by not just fans and non fans but also movie goers who love thrilling stories of Adventure and or character development ... I admire what Star Trek is and won't dislike people who love it , My only hope is like with the first two films it will surprise us with new elements withing the original universe but be like it's own thing with these characters story arcs in the alternate time line ...

Beyond just looking like it, we see kirk at 2:11 wearing a uniform jacket that is similar to the style worn by Archer in his time, stark Navy Blue with 4 yellow shoulder lines. Then if you look at 2:12 you can see the bridge is very old and outdated, with computer screens displaying greenline readouts, compared to the Apple store look that all the trek ships have in this cannon, plus you look at the ceiling lights and their covered in dust and dirt, suggesting the ships been sitting a very long time. And in one of the prior trailers you see scotty walk onto a bridge thats rusted, and beat up. I dont believe this is a modern ship successor to the NX class as it wouldnt be this woefully outdated. It would be awesome in a way to see the very first enterprise reactivated to go to battle one final time under the command of Kirk.

2016-07-07T23:12:12,"Hello Everyone, I feel I need to post this. For those who might have missed it, due to a fan based film both CBS and Paramount have issued ""guidelines"" that actually destroy all the possibilities of anymore real fan based trek films in the future. If you would like to know more search for ""star trek prelude to Axanar"" and watch the previews and details about the show. There are many fan based films for you to watch and some are really good considering they are not made by a real studio. You will even see a few real actors are involved and the efforts have been made to have a very high quality of production. Yes, some not so much but its about Star Trek not production. Now please consider that for many years now they (CBS and Paramount) have allowed a few groups to make many really good (and some not so good) episodes based on Star Trek in many versions as long as they do not ""make a profit"" from the production. To actual start making the episode Axanar they had a fund drive and made over 1 million US Dollars so, CBS and Paramount sued them to stop production. Recently they released the ""guidelines"" for all future fan based films that are not only not constitutional points (like actors who worked in any trek can’t work in fan based films and vice a versa) but limit production time and costs in such a way that means no less than a clear effort to kill all fan based Star Trek films. Read the complete set of guidelines here: http://www.startrek.com/fan-films I ask all fans to get educated on these Star Trek fan based films to read up on this matter. Please learn the facts about the past films and the possibility of future for more of them. If you cannot agree that CBS and Paramount be allowed to force these guidelines on fan film production please help us stop them. Also please compare the way the fan films for Star Wars are treated where they even offer a public awards show for them. I, and other Star Trek fans are calling for a boycott of the upcoming movie and the 2017 series on CBS unless they publicly stop this and provide the fans with a reasonable and legal ability to enjoy others ideas of the Star Trek world. They have allowed it for years but now they are moving to kill them while hoping it won’t affect them making more money off Star Trek. So, let’s boycott them and stop the money they would make from the 7-22 release of Star Trek Beyond and the 2017 series planned to have one show on TV then the rest on a pay service only from CBS. If they see enough decrease of the upcoming movie sales they will obey us as the fans and workout a real reasonable way for them to continue without the idiotic and illegal current guidelines. I, and more than 20 people I know have agreed to boycott the new film unless this is fixed right.  Thanks for your time.",0,0,Alan Hamby,bzD8H6o1awQ,0.1436821789321789,2016-07-07 23:12:12,True,True

Chris Pine is the one that led to me to watch the first new movie because I think he is kinda cute ( not a fan of him just think he is kinda cute ) and also besides that the movie had one of my favourite action and plots! These are the reasons that I watched the second one and is going to watch Star Trek Beyond too besides the fact that once you watch the first movie of a series you have to watch all of them to see what has happened. But what I don't understand is why all of you people who are fans of the old star trek criticize the movie and hate it and why can't you guys just let it go and enjoy the movie and appreciate the fact that they are making new movies to make you guys happy.
