2015-10-01T15:08:50,Just watched it and was disappointed. It's very rare when a film ends up being as good as it looks in it's trailer. Similar to when a game company releases a vertical slice of an upcoming video game but before it does it jacks up the graphics to make it look awesome knowing full well they will have to downgrade later to get 60 fps across all systems. In each scenario it's always the same...a giant letdown. They advertise the best parts and later on we get to see all the crap in between. The movie is watchable but I would never shell out cash to see it in the theater or spend 30 bucks on the blu ray. This is strictly a wait till it's in the bargain bin movie.,0,0,Darcy L,SQxX8B-RjKY,0.08384615384615383,2015-10-01 15:08:50,True,True

2016-03-12T15:51:45,"U know what would be fun to see all holidays that even kids&grownups celebrate. Not that I'm saying the Santa Clause franchise, Rise of the Guardians or even Fred Claus made perfect examples of what I'm talking about. As followed for a XMas film of my choosing. If I were to write it myself, it would sound like this. Like to narrate this idea, I had the other day.  ""It was another year before Xmas and Santa's Newyrs Resolution was to ensure thisyrs Xmas had been better than the last as every year was on the night before Xmas Eve. During thisyr, Santa would still do his usual routine and visit his friends: Easter Bunny / Cupid / Sandman / Tooth Fairy &even his parents, Mother Nature and Father Time. Especially, when Santa was preparing for the day when snow would fall. It was a sign that his long-lost troubled teen-aged son, Jack Frost was coming home for Xmas as he always did. Santa's 'good' elves would continue to make the new toys for the kids on the NICE list, while Santa was visiting his friends&family. Santa recently lost Mrs. Claus, but that wasn't going to ruin his Xmas thisyr. It had already been 1yr since Mrs. Claus had passed, this was the window that had him distracted, since the NAUGHTY list grew so long bc 'The Big-Red Guy' stopped checking it twice thisyr and it fell into the wrong hands, theft right from under him by the 'bad' elves, who now worked for The Bogeyman or as St.Nikolai once called him, his little brother Krampus. He had ruined every public holiday, even Xmas, but that's another story for another year.""  I have more. I think, I'll leave it there. Well, Cupid loves Sandy, Krampus kidnaps Cupid after Candy breakup on Vday and bc Krampus ruined that holiday, he's in love w/her anyway and she knew years ago. Oh, and EasterBunny had a mental breakdown bc during the Hunt, Krampus took&ate all the chocolate eggs&rabbits he had hidden for the kids who believed in him to find, then sent a copy of the Naughty list to Nikolai putting all those kids who stopped believing in EB who were all on the Nice list, but that was after those same kids took the other kids chocolate eggs&rabbits E.B. had left that weren't found from the year before as Easter Day was celebrated no more. So, yeah. Sandy went back to his world of dreams, while Cupid was taken by Krampus to his alter-egos world of Nightmares that scared her half to death. &so since Sandy was Cupid's ex-boyfriend he had to help Nikolai save Cupid from his evil little brother. This led to Nikolai&Bogey's parents reappearing as Mother Nature was the cause of Krampus living a double life of insanity&stupidity by ruining other people's lives. As their father, was Father Time who had wished to stop time and rewind to the night before Xmas Eve and remember why Krampus hated Xmas altogether and started calling himself the Boogeyman. Then, ofc! there was Nikolai's long-lost son Jack Frost who moved out of the North Pole after his mother died, a Xmas before father&son were&grew estranged, but Jack still had time and still promised his grandparents he would still come home for Xmas, even though like his evil uncle. Jack hated Xmas as well. But, the Tooth Fairy was his godmother. So, Jack was doing OK! I guess.  HAPPY EASTER EVERYONE!!! EVEN THO, it's like 2wks away :D But, HEY! That's the short version of my Xmas story I'm writing atm.",0,0,Real Cosmic Builds,SQxX8B-RjKY,0.01963055883510432,2016-03-12 15:51:45,False,False
