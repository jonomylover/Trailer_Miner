Jason Zimmer's skull is fractured.  You could have killed him!""   In my book, the lady saying the above quote should have called THE POLICE on this student!!! The main character is an asshole for doing this to Jason.  He not only should have been kicked out of the school where that happened, but also should have been thrown in jail for this!!!!  GOD THAT FUCKING PISSES ME OFF ON SO MANY LEVELS!!!!     I feel like I want to yell the following to both my mom and Auntie:  ""Remember when you two rented the movie ""The Boy Next Door""?

I watched this film a few months ago on live TV and it was torture to watch. I mean it started off fine in the first ten or twenty minutes, but then it just becomes too weird and over-the-top that it makes it hard to enjoy and take seriously. I would not recommend watching this movie.",0,0,TheDestroyer2alltrolls,MgbBwovOOoc,-0.12402935606060607,2019-02-02 18:38:15,False,False
