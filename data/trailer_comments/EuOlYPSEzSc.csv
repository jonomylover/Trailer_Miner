2017-07-09T05:26:55,"Nice liberal propaganda, hollywood. I knew just from the title alone that this would be peddling the typical global warming (oh wait, now it's ""climate change"") bullshit that tries to make sense of our chaotic, unpredictable weather systems (about as feasible as random number interpolation) and subsequently changes drastically every decade or so. Those ""climate scientists"" over at NASA are really wasting their decent brainpower-- maybe they should, perhaps, direct their attention towards aeronautics and space...  The fact that this trailer additionally references self-driving cars, which are a phantom technology that silicon valley is shilling in order to push the concept of a universal basic income, which if passed would ultimately prevent the passage of legislation limiting workforce automation and allow for a reentry into serfdom, allows me to begin my argument. Self-driving cars are the easiest way for silicon valley to demonstrate the cataclysmic consequences of widespread automation without effective legislation in place. What they don't want you to know, however, is that universal basic income is not a real solution to the problems created by this push towards a fully automated workforce that they are responsible for. Even with UBI, society would eventually converge to a point at which the entire means of production would be owned by a single conglomerate that would be free to control the public however they saw fit. UBI is masquerading as some holy grail of a socialist society wherein everyone is freed from ""those pesky corporate overlords,"" but it would actually result in the opposite taking place-- through paying a standard wage to everyone, UBI deincentivizes those who have lost their jobs due to automation from finding a new job, or, most importantly, backing legislation that would prevent further automation of the workforce. Liberals love pushing for UBI to seem progressive and enlightened, while at the same time considering all the CEOs and corporations to be the roots of all evils of our society, yet they fail to see the fact that the prior plays directly into the hand of the latter.  The US Govt (the military industrial complex) has effectively prevented its citizens from responding to major issues over the past three decades through false flag over false flag. Its most impressive success as of now was the revelation of widespread surveillance of its citizens being met with virtually no public protest. As the complex continues to tighten its grip on its citizens, you can be sure that their interests will not align with the interests of their citizens. UBI is only one example of a false flag; climate change is yet another.  The military industrial complex wants the public to view science the same way Europeans viewed the Catholic church before the reformation. We are slowly entering a new dark age, where assertions that have been published in papers must be heralded as the word of God. Note, too, that through funding research and publications, the military industrial complex has complete control over what gets published and what is never even given the chance to be tested. The leaders of the military industrial complex will effectively become the silent guiding hands of this new church. The worst part is that refuting this new church through logic will become increasingly difficult as the years go on, and so the walls guarding this new world will climb higher and higher. As this church-in-disguise shapes human knowledge, logic itself will slowly become eroded until refutation of the scientific method is impossible. This is already happening to some extent (See Robert Pirsig).  In conclusion, climate change is bullshit, science itself is becoming bullshit, UBI is bullshit, the US Govt is poisoning our water supply, Christ returned already and was killed by the Grand Inquisitor, and Bush did 9/11 xd",1,0,Gl3nnleblanc,EuOlYPSEzSc,0.022464533458509364,2017-07-09 05:26:55,True,True

2017-10-24T18:39:38,"Spoilers for: Geostorm (2017)  Geostorm is most likely one of the worst movies of 2017, the biggest reason I would have to say is the whole ""who did it"".Since it was very simple to figure out who it was, but not why they did what they did. The plot is that there is a space weather station (A station in space that can alter weather)that goes haywire and many people in the movie think its a glitch or malfunction. It was somebody doing it on purpose. So the characters are Gerard Butler,Jim Sturgess ,and some other people. So it starts out with some exposition by some 13 year old girl. And wow the girl is Gerard Butler‚Äôs daughter, their relationship throughout this movie was AWFUL. Here are some reasons why: She acts independent even though she is 9,wait 13  She dumps all information into everything she says, she‚Äôs like oh, you are not reliable dad...I mean she knows that but we don‚Äôt know, there could have been a better way to reveal Another trait many of these heroes in movies are at least one of these; Late to important meetings Not the best parent Etc Etc Another awful aspect was the visuals and music, I don‚Äôt know much about ‚Äúspecial effects‚Äù and ‚Äúscoring‚Äù or whatever so don‚Äôt expect much. Also there was a timer, timers in many movies are the worst. They are meant to be scary/suspenseful because ‚ÄúIf the timer runs out _____ and ____ will happen.‚Äù But what it boils down to is the movie making pointless obstacles to get the timer down to one second. The music felt undeserved when something  is going on. So let me give an example,Gerard Butler and Jim Sturgess are brothers so Jim was put in charge of Gerard Butler‚Äôs project and he was pissed.( He was so pissed he han‚Äôt had contact with his brother for 3   years and calling him a stranger when he sees him again.) So the government guys needed to send him up back to the  space station and they sent to convince his brother to go. So this is all we knew about their relationship at this point in the movie: Their brothers Their parents died Gerard Butler doesn‚Äôt listen/respect his brothers actions (Example: During a press conference JIm told Gerard helpful information via texts and Gerard didn‚Äôt care) So there wasn‚Äôt much build up to their conversation about him going to space, but the music is treating it like we have been through their entire lives through thick and thin but i digress. One other major problem is the special effects, yes the trailers were half good because of the destruction but other than that there wasn‚Äôt as much effort. I can‚Äôt describe it so let‚Äôs go to the next point. The acting was fine out of the one person you‚Äôd expect but everyone else,besides a couple actors, were below average, judging acting isn‚Äôt my best place to ‚Äúcritique‚Äù.  Overall this movie wasn‚Äôt that good, on a scale 1-10 this movie would have a 4/10",0,0,Nicholas Snider,EuOlYPSEzSc,0.029563492063492056,2017-10-24 18:39:38,False,True

Did he do this film for charity? My god can't believe how bullshit this film actually is. For example you cannot get dragged through a solar sail head first in space lol wtf there is no gravity so if he did hit it he would not be bouncing down it being dragged face first through it he would of bounced if it. Secondly nothing just freezes in space when the vacuum in the geostorm station control room occurs the window freezes up, it gets as cold as long as it takes for heat to radiate from a room or body. If you thought San Andreas and 2012 were bad then you haven't seen nothing until you have seen this complete crap. Same old people dodging cars flying off freeways while driving themselves and reverse handbraking to do a 180 into reverse to kill some bad guys while it all goes down was just the fucking icing on the cake. Director and producer need a fucking slap and also re-educating on the science of space before making a bullshit film displaying no factual science what so fucking ever...

Next bit is about the ending, so SPOILER:  The ending was a bit cheesy though. Every human being having the look on their face of 'we've been saved'. Normally people would've been terrified. Neither can you tell me that storms that have been conjured up just subside 5 seconds after pressing a button. Actually humanity is still screwed because the 'net' was the only thing keeping earthly phenomena from going nuts. Guess this is the Independence Day-syndrome.
