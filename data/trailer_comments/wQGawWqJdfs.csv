My oldest (10) says, ""it's saying the oil company is bad,  because their trying to destroy the environment and it's OK to break the law if it hurts bad companys"". Gladly he was able to point out the many times in the movie when the ""hero's"" would have paid fines and or went jail for breaking laws. My 8 year old ""trucks are cool"". And my 3 year old ""wants more treats"". I really don't know who Chris Wedge (the director) is, but as a father of two I'm suprised he's not more cautious on endorsing environmental  terrorism. I mean in the movie the kids stole, damaged property, broke in to at least two businesses, endangered many people's lives to stop the oil company. The ""heros"" broke the law that's a bad thing. What the owneres of the company did that was illegal is very vague. Im not sure they did anything illegal if taken from what the ""heors"" could have known. There for the message becomes: Make wild assumptions then break the law to right a preseved wrong, and by-pass due process. Looking at it  objectivly- the drilling would have been premited, there are protocals, regulations and procedures in place for everything the company did up until the animals come out of the ground, no reality excises in this movie after that. Avenues already exist that prevents and or convicts actions such as trying to poison an entire inelegant species. From the get go the EPA would have been contacted - reqliquid by law when liquid gets out of containment not to mention the investigation from OSHA.

Also, I have a question, when they were sneaking in to free the monsters, where were the guards?!  You have two rare, oil drinking, monsters just lying around in tanks, and you have no one guarding it?! Another thing is that, there were a lot of things that the main characters could've done differently to achieved their goal, but that happened in a lot of movies so I'll give that one a pass.
