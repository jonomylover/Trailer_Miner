2019-11-19T17:54:33,"I'm going to watch this. It'll be phenomenal.  My only beef is this. All the despicable things FOX news does, including further destroying Americans minds and promoting fascism. This is the story you choose to tell? Really, this one?  Not that it's unworthy, but this one? Open white nationalism, blatant propaganda, violence inducing rhetoric on a daily basis,omission of culpability for aiding in the rise of the far right. But, we want to make a movie about sexual assault. That's never been done. Committed by a member of a political party who believes ""boys will be boys"". Again, it's worthy. It's filthy. Although not a bit surprising. It is an account of a very rare moment when FOX took an L. It is not even close to the most vile things FOX has participated in. It's also not what will be written about in the history books. Again, I'll watch it.
