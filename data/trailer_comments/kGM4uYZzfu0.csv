The only people this safe ""heroic"" so random Harley & friends bullshit appeals to are prude twitter feminist who don't give a shit about BOP, they just want to use Harley as a absurd feminist iconic for leaving the Joker.

In the comics she is basically River Tam from Serenity who is so profoundly badass she could probably beat Batman hand to hand and yet here she is a wisecracking out of shape little brat.  - Canary not having her fishnets (but they gave it to harley for the Roller Dirby???)  - Black Mask... not having a Black Fucking Mask.",1,1,Darkest Iron,kGM4uYZzfu0,0.07656250000000003,2019-10-01 16:09:00,True,True

It could start off like a feminist story where Quinn realises she doesn't need a man ( Gotham's resident psycho Mr.J) then break up with him. She then decides to team up with some female super-villains /criminals to take down big (guy) boss Black Mask who ironically at the end turns out to be Letos Joker in disguise and falls back in love with him over how despicably manipulative he is. Black Masks film end identity reveal would be the same as the Jokers in the Arkham Origins game which would be a nice nod to fans and she would still stick with him cos hes a stupid psycho and hes a criminal genius. Plus it would follow on nicely from their twisted love hate relationship in Suicide Squad and keep us guessing (AGAIN) as to where the Joker is throughout the entire film.

They too called the films the X-Men though 90% of their stories revolved exclusively around the romance between Wolverine and Jean Grey. I really really hope the film isn't centered just around Harley. If they have a good script and it indeed centers around her, please rename the film. If the trailer focuses on her but all the actresses have as much or just a little less than Harley with screen time then keep the name but give us a more accurate trailer please.

If anyone hears me and opens the door, I will come in."" These words illustrates the kindness of Jesus Christ. He gently knocks on the door of our souls with His offer of peace. Jesus stands and patiently waits for us to respond.                                                  He does not open the door Himself and force His way into our lives. He does not impose His will on ours.  Instead, He offers to all people the gift of salvation and light to guide us. To anyone who opens the door, He promises to enter. There are no other requirements or prerequisites. If you hear the voice of Jesus and His gentle knock on the door of your soul, be encouraged that He patiently waits for you and will enter if you welcome Him in.                                              Dear one, acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord. Welcome Abba YHWH (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be justified in salvation. You will be blessed abundantly with love. Jesus loves you so much, His love for you can't be adequately described in mere words. He knew you and have loved you BEFORE the creation and foundation of this earth.                    Please be of good cheer in praying the following prayer with me.... Dear Lord Jesus, thank You for the gift of salvation and Your promise to enter when we open the door. Please help me to respond to this gift and open the door for You today. I honor You, I worship You, I praise You, and I love You. This I pray in Your Mighty Mighty name, Amen!

Based upon the Italian Commedia dell'arte (Which i have read!)  His role is that of a light-hearted, nimble, and astute servant (true needs a master), often acting to THWART the plans of his master, and pursuing his OWN love interest, Columbina, with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot. He later develops into a prototype of the romantic HERO. Harlequin inherits his physical agility and his trickster qualities, as well as his name, from a mischievous ""devil"" character in medieval passion plays. (Yes from wik, its the best quickest deff)   Yes I understand this is DC's version. But don't make up your own fucking definition and role of a word that already exists!   But on another note, this... does not look good. And i want it to. I like all the actors in this. But damn it looks.. kinda boring and silly. Gonna be all plot and forced comedy.

And although audiences weren't crazy about the first Suicide Squad film, they really liked Harley Quinn, so what does the studio do?? They make the next film ALL ABOUT.

2019-10-02T02:32:12,"ourforgiveness.c*o*m   Hear ye, and hearken unto mine words,  O ye children of the land. Bible prophesies are being fulfilled, the early birth pains are on the rise ""For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these¬†are¬†the beginning of sorrows.‚Äù¬†(Matthew 24:7-8). Christianity is being suppressed worldwide by the increasing number of new laws that oppose conservative christianity values. Self-deceived philosophers make no mention of Christ as the means for salvation; and New Age propaganda such as: spirituality, consciousness, chakras, meditation, enlightment, law of attraction, scientology, and prosperity preaching only corrupt the body, spirit, and soul. ""Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves"" (Matthew 7:15). ""And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light"" (2 Corinthians 11:14); he is a liar, and a murderer. Be not deceived, ""Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them"" (Matthew 7:20). For the Lord has said "" My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:¬†And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand"" (John 10:27-28). I encourage you friends to do some basic research, and you will see that a cashless society is at the horizon. And the microchipping of humans is already here, and sooner than later the following words shall come to pass ""And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name"" (Revelation 13:16-17). Ask yourself how much do you love money, ""For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows"" (1 Timothy 6:10). Now, who among you seeks after power and fame?, ""For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?""(Mark 8:36). Time to wake up friends, the world is not going to get any better, even if religious leaders try to unify and coexist; for Jesus said ""Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword"" (Matthew 10:34), to separate believers from the non believers. He also said, ""...I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (John 14:6). Jesus is the the ONLY way to Heaven brothers, all other religions are false and will not save you from lake of fire, for what communion does Jesus have with Allah?, or what righteousness is there in Shiva or Belial? Nay', Isay. ‚ÄúNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.‚Äù¬†(Acts 4:12). We need to encourage and persuade other faiths to embrace the good news of salvation that is through Christ. Do not be deceived friends, but rather examine yourself and see what is causing you to love the world, for it is written: ""Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.¬†For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world"" (1 John 2:15-1). Your life, my beloved, is but a mist ""Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away"" (James 4:14). Now Therefore, be ye not mockers of the truth, and purge out the unfruitful works of darkness that dwells in you. And again, Some of you have children and loved ones, think about their souls. Awaken my brothers, and call upon the LORD, that He may refresh your souls with living waters, arise from the shadows of darkness and sing to the LORD, be not ashame of righteousness, justice, and holiness. Strive ye to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Behold!, now is the time of grace, Now is the time of salvation. Do not be deaf to the call, answer, while you still can.   To the believer: ""Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."" (2 Timothy 2:15). And remember to pray for the lost souls, even as satan uses them to oppress and persecute us, ""For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.""(Ephesians6:12). Our commission, brethren, is to preach the Gospel of Christ. And let us also bring hope and comfort to the weak and destitute. Be wise therefore how you present the Gospel to different types of people, and do not compromise your purity.   To the spiritually lost: Turn to God and ""If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."" (1 John 1:9). And ""...if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."" (Romans 10:9) ""For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."" (Luke 11:10)  read the New Testament. ***  All glory be to the Most High God.",0,0,ourforgiveness *com,kGM4uYZzfu0,0.12848184223184222,2019-10-02 02:32:12,True,True

2019-10-02T03:46:13,"I'm not sure how to feel about this movie... on the one hand I love Harley Quinn, I thought Margot did a great job bringing her to life in Suicide Squad.    I also loved Harley in Batman TAS, and I don't have much exposure to her outside of those 2 things, but I am aware of her goings on via fan groups and nerd discussions, so I know about her on and off relationship with Ivy, and I know about the popularity of the Harley  comics which put a big spotlight focus on Harley and her exploits(naturally)...  With all that said, I feel like, with my light knowledge of the Harley comics, this movie is seemingly authentic to the art style of the comics, with all the crazy pastel colors and Harley's ""new look"", and all that, but maybe for the same reason I've never cared to delve into the Harley comics, this movie just doesn't seem to pull me in at all... which confuses me because I like the character, and I love Ewan Mcgregor as an actor...  Maybe it's the fact that I've been conditioned to take movies with too much emphasis on ""girl power"", ""diversity"" or other SJW nonsense that's kinda keeping my interest at bay... I mean I'm totally gonna watch this, I give every movie a fair shot regardless of how uninterested I am in it.  So i'll keep my judgement of it until after I've gotten a chance to watch it, but so far I have to say, I'm very underwhelmed... I mean as I said, I'm not the BIGGEST fan of Harley, but I do enjoy the character and Margot's portrayal of her, but this movie just seems ""Meh..."" to me in the same way that the show Gotham always seemed ""Meh..."" to me...  I hope it's great, but so far, there's nothing that's got me excited in the slightest...

Harley Quinn is about the realities of abuse, this idea that every female character has to stand up and kick ass is the exact same level of pathetic as thinking they should all be damsels in distress, because that's what you are making them by implying all female characters need to be saved. It's limits female characters, it prevents them from being complete and complex characters and turns them into a pathetic fantasy escape for people who can't handle the fact that women are just people, with the same flaws and unhappy endings. They're still defined by men, their entire movies, their entire existence, is defined by men, and they are laughing stock of every man and woman who doesn't give a fuck about what the other sex wants, rebelling against something is as pathetic as pandering to it, both make you secondary to people who couldn't give a fuck about you.  They're doing their own thing, barely aware of your existence, and you are still letting them define who you are.  This is why people HATE ""strong female characters"", because they're never strong, they're always examples of pathetic weakness, and an insecure pathological need to paint themselves and all other women as victims.

Barabara Gordon could be introduced, so if she wasn't Batgirl yet, then have another reason for her to be there. Hawk and Dove maybe. Poison Ivy, let's start up her and Harley working together. Savant, and his assistant¬†Creote because they had a good dynamic with the rest of the Birds.  And, introduce Lady Shiva and have the Birds having to watch out for her and Black Mask. I know Catwoman Selina Kyle can't be in it because they are using her in the Batman movies.

I hope they will be focused in her martial arts since Black Canary is one of the best martial artist in DC universe. -Huntress She has her crossbow, and i hope to see her, in her purple costume. - The police girl? I think i saw her somewhere, but i am still not sure that's her. -Cassandra Cain? I think she is the young Asian girl?OMG!!! I would be so happy if they really put Cass in the movie!!

( I know Harley Quinn is in not on birds of prey but it is a spin off movie!! And Margot in her interview said a million times that it will more likely focus on Harley Quinn and shut up what if they cut Harley Quinn scenes too because of you people. Cause she said Harley loves interacting with people so she thought why not something different then she came up with birds of prey and movies sequel Gotham city sirens will come it's not cancelled. And I liked Leto joker cause he was an another aspect on joker a gangsta modern era joker he is not a psychopath but he is Crazy , he tried his best ,no hate on heath's joker loved his too RIP. If you liked that joker abused Harley Quinn then you all are heartless , I wished that he never abused her but in his language of psycho's he loved her he is NOT a normal person SO he can't love her in a NORMAL HUMAN WAY and DC comics and animations are much darker for the big screen , I bet half of you can be MARVEL fans trying out stuff so listen up marvel is for KIDS and yeah I said that now don't talk about Deadpool,endgame kiss or whatever. Snow White also had a kissing scene and was for tots most of the kids movies has kissing scenes Disney live sitcom shows also has KISSING alot but in a limit and is for tots and kids under 13 so?? Most of the tots and kids thought their life as Disney princesses.... And Deadpool is an adult movie that's okay but MOST of the Marvel movies are for kids and take them lightly and kids shows also show people leaving or dieing sometimes it is just that it is not DARK!! UNDERSTAND??? No one ever had the courage to stand up and say it at loud but I said it!! Just Google it or ask any comic fan  Which comics are better  Marvel and DC  And it will say DC Just ask any 90's kids or early 2000's kids who watched  cartoon network and also watched marvel cartoons They will say DC cartoons are better Ask someone to play a marvel game series like Arkham origins and now ask someone to play injustice or telltale batman games they will say DC games are the best  Ask someone which movie universe is better they will say MARVEL and yeah it is so DC has developed in everything but it will take some time to develop in movies and also DC came first and then Marvel came where marvel is good at nothing accept movies they say MARVEL is best they do not say MCU is best . DC universe and marvel universe has different partions Animated, Games and most importantly comics then movies.. So in most of the partions DC is good so it wins some of the marvel comics are dark but only few ones.... Anything else you guys wanna say . Say it in the replies also Stan Lee the legend ( RIP) dreamt of having DC characters with marvel characters like batman , superman, wonder woman , flash and much more he was the one who wrote the comics when DC universe was new then he made his Marvel universe inspired by DC universe he respected our universe too.... And we ( whole DC universe  true fans) respected him too..... But his dream never came true cause when he was thinking about this DC Vs MARVEL started so he didn't want any hatred that's why he dropped the idea but still thought someday his dream will come true.

2019-10-18T05:22:40,They literally cut the Harley/Joker story from SS minus the absolute bare bones. Harley needs a strong Joker/Abuser/Mr.J . This movie is going to bomb hard because it's hanging it's success on Harley who literally has no motivation or backstory or character. I'm hoping that Gunn can right the ship with SS2 but the studio seems to  be actively trying to sabotage their own property with this nonsense. Avengers proved that team-ups work with established characters. Guardians proved that you don't need to establish all of your characters if you have an engaging script and dynamic direction.

Plus Margot Robbie erased everything about her portrayal of the character people gravitated to in suicide squad to appeal to the massive  imaginary group of people a small group of easily offended dorks on Twitter come off as. Todd Phillips and Joaquin pheonix really have their finger on the pulse of how people feel/what's going on in the world. This shit is like the total opposite of majority of the sentiment people are feeling in this country/worldwide (whether you lean right or left) and comes off more like they(the producers/filmmakers)really believe the world is what media spin artists and identity politicians keep trying to tell everyone it is.

Clearly not one person involved has any familiarity with the source material, let alone the passion to make sure the film does it justice.   Also, I cannot understand why so many people love Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. She's not as true to the source material as I would like, and the only thing more fake and cringy than her acting is her abysmal attempt to do Harley's iconic voice. It feels like she's so focused on trying to force the voice, slowly spitting the words out and over-anunciating, in a very strange tone that sounds nothing like Harley's iconic high-pitched voice, that the voice and the acting comes across as forced, wooden, methodical, and tired. Harley should have much more light, energy, carelessness, and speed to her, and you need to see that crazy look in her eyes. Harley is almost childlike; she is very raw, emotional, and authentic. She is far from reality. Harley Quinn doesn't ACT crazy, she IS crazy.

Social media stars are wannabe celebrities plain and simple! I don't care how much views and money u make! U guys can even meet (real) celebrities but you're not one of them. The difference social media stars aka wannabe vs real celebrities, celebrities don't need social media to be who they are and famous they never needed social media really at all or to maintain who they are but without social media none of you would have any existence and if it were to disappear one day you would be back to being nobody's which you guys still are trust me cuz anybody could do this social media fake same crap you all are just a bunch of sorry narcississ losers! and I don't care what anybody says neither on social media everybody just jumps bandwagons or pretends to care about things and promote things but it's just a bunch of crap it's phony like I said stay in touch with the physical not the digital you guys are in delusion this is not reality and I don't care how much quote on quote positivity you guys feel there is it's really just staying behind a screen clicking buttons I don't find that uplifting or anyting because social media is too easy habe u all not seen the increase in suicide and stds this decade 2010s?! Social media is the shit answer and there's no excuse for this ad the future where we all know better for it to be like this. It's also sorry asf how webcam girls ruin all the need stuff and think they're pornstars when they're not they're just nobody whores sitting behind a laptop and being a pornstar doesn't exist no more social media growing has halted that too lol. You wannabe celebs with your fake""fame"" won't go past social media I assure u. Social media is a place for losers to feel important and social delusion. Many obssess, degrade, harm, or live a lie online about themselves yet want to portray it as ""positive"" Or talk about their problems on social media lol that's not healthy! Narcissism personality disorder + Social media anxiety is a actual diagnosis that many of u do indeed fucking have. Subscribers make your day?!üò≥üò≤üòÜ It's like u can do something good for yourself/others with out showing it off constantly on your social media pathetic! Your job is not show others your living a ""life"". I'm well aware some can even get rich on here or meet famous people but that doesn't make u a celebrity! ""Social media star"" is the biggest joke!

Their was something about her and her role in Suicide Squad that was just perfect. Maybe its because I'm a guy and she was pretty sexy in it. Maybe it how unique and twisted her character was. But she was perfect for the roll. I'm not a comic book guy, so I couldn't tell you much of anything aside from what I see in the movies or from what some of my friends tell me, or news snippets and such. But I do know she did this roll perfect which left allot of us crazing for more.  I am really hoping she makes the Joker look like a joke in this new movie. And while like many others, I did not feel the Joker in Suicide Squad was done right at all, I still appreciate it on some level. I haven't seen the new Joker movie yet, but I have been enjoying the different Jokers along the way. However I do which they could stick with one version, one movie, and just continue a story, not redue it after each movie or two.   Either way, I am looking forward to seeing this. IT looks very promising. And I hope they didn't change her character too much as it was perfect in suicide squad.",0,0,Dan Stun,kGM4uYZzfu0,0.289491341991342,2019-12-07 14:47:59,True,True

2019-12-16T23:14:34,"Margot Robbie has absolutely nailed Harley Quinn, this just proves it. I just wonder about the other characters. If the young Asian woman is Cassandra Cain, she's been trained from birth to be the ultimate assassin by a professional killer so capable that he trained Batman. The Huntress is about a lot more than crossbows, she has more pain and loss driving her than anyone but Batman. The Black Canary is a Metahuman who can bring down a building with her Canary Cry. Renee Montoya is a cop on the GCPD before she Resigns after her Partner is killed by a dirty cop and she comes with seconds of killing the killer herself when she can't get justice-but she can't go through with it. Then, of course, there's Batman himself... But, is this even set in Gotham?

JokerXHarley is quite possibly the most toxic romance I have ever seen in a story and I am so excited and happy that Harley is breaking away from her abuser. I also really like how Harley has replaced Barbara Gordon in this movie. I have never liked Barbara Gordon and I like her even less ever since we got the New 52 and Rebirth. The only concern I have is how they're going to portray Cassandra Cain. She's my favorite Batgirl and while I am happy they have cast an actress who kind of looks like her, (she's not exactly how I pictured Cass, but I can let it go since they're at least trying to be accurate to how the character looks in the comics, especially if she's a good actress), I fear that they won't portray Cass's character correctly seeing as she is quite possibly the biggest badass on the planet who is a nearly unbeatable fighter, reads body langauge and couldn't speak until she was in her late teens due to a psychic's intervention, and was trained to be an assassin from the time she was born due to being the daughter of David Cain and Lady Shiva.

2020-02-07T17:47:24,"""Do you know what a harlequin is? A Harley Quinn's role is to serve. It's nothing without a master. No one gives two shits who we are.""  Fuck this okay. Harley was the Joker's Queen. ""God help anyone who disrespected the queen"" remember that? For those of you fucktards who don't remember allow me to jog your stupid memories.  https://youtu.be/lz2Nkal_kgc  And I know this is going to piss a lot of you off. But without joker there wouldn't be a Harley. Now don't get it twisted. I'm not trying to say that Harley is useless without the Joker that's not what I'm trying to say it all so step away from the comment section and hear me out. There is some truth to that. Why don't you all educate yourselves. Click on this link, scroll down, and then click history.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn  You see? No joker no Harley. I'm not trying to say that she's worthless without him. The character has come a long way sence her first appearance in batman the animated series. I'm just trying to say that joker and Harley where literally made for each other and they're better off together than they are apart. When you go into stores what do you see? You see them on t-shirts together, you see them on posters, together you see action figures of them together. Every one I've talked to so far has agreed that what made the first suicide squad so good was the fact that joker and harley didn't hate each other. And now you are telling me they are going back to the whole abusive relationship? You people bitch and complain how joker treats harley like shit. And just when things were starting to look good for the characters you went and undid it all. Instead of building the characters up you're tearing them down. And frankly I'm sick of it. I'm sick of the DC comics. Their storyline is going nowhere it's the same shit every single time. Joker and Harley fight, Harley comes close to killing, joker but never does. They fight and fight and fight and fight. Well I can tell you right fucking now it gets old really damn quick. But it doesn't have to be that way. Anyone who disagrees get the fuck out. They have proven time after time after time that joker is fixable. There is a comic book where joker goes sane. Its literally called going sane. He isn't abusive to harley in suicide squad. He actually cares and rescued her. Twice. Onece when. She jumped into the vat of chemicals and again at the end when he breaks her out of her cell. He isn't abusive to her in arkham asylum or arkham city. And In the White knight series he goes sane again. So dont you sit there and tell me that the joker is unfixable. So many people agreed that joker and Harleys relationship was purfect in suicide squad. It was even this great scene towards the end of the movie where Harley fantasizes about a life with Joker.  https://youtu.be/vXckaOOHNl8  Joker Goes sane, you even see him without the makeup, her and him are married and have two kids, sound familiar? I'm of course talking about the Dee Dee twins from Batman Beyond. Are we all just going to forget about that?  Are we all just going to sweep that under the rug? That's what pisses me off about this? You are just going to tear that all down. ""Joker lurned to have emotion through Harley"" Mark Hamill said that. He's Luke Skywalker damn it. Don't fuck with him. And he's right. Harley was there to keep the Joker in check. His partner in crime. And you destroyed that. I'll be seeing you on Rotten Tomatoes you morons. You can all kiss my ass in hell. This is why dc sucks. This is why I'm a marvel fan. Because marval is so much better than you retarded fucks. They could kill Iron Man off a thousand times and it still wouldn't be as bad as this shit.

I‚Äôm all for female empowerment if I wasn‚Äôt I wouldn‚Äôt be coming to pay for a $17 dollar movie ticket. But this movie is anti men to the point your like just why?! Black mask is a total cry baby douche and that‚Äôs everything to his character development. The story is all over the place, messy and non linear.

Even if you thought Margot Robbie was just OKAY in Suicide Squad, I guarantee you'll adore her in this film as she just let's loose with this character. The villian was really over the top, but fun and the new characters are great. The style of the film is gorgeous and really in tone with Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey. And while there isn't a whole LOT of humor, the jokes that they do throw at you are pretty clever.  A couple downsides is that I found the female Police Officer kinda of uninteresting and there didn't feel there was a real sense of threat compared to previous DC films.  But overall, it's most definitely a great DC film. I think you'll get something nice out of it no matter what your expectations are.",4,1,Ben J.
