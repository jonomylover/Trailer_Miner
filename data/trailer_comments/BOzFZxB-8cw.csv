I also wish this were more true to the book...there shouldn't be any Overlook Hotel since in the Shining novel the thing got blown up.

He has tons of important black characters who are in his books and the respective films. So why does Abras skin color has to change?

The idea that the ghosts are allies kind of makes sense, too, since they revealed to Danny that Johnny was going to murder his mother, and he survived in the hedge maze where his father didn't. Seemingly, the malevolence in the Overlook is akin to radiation, where it just attacks the minds of those that can be affected by it (the abused, or those that Shine), and seduces the minds of those who can be controlled by it (the abusers, the dark).

2019-11-08T22:58:37,"This didn't work and I'm trying to figure out how it could have been an appropriate sequel to an epic like The Shining.¬† First, the ghost things were too visible, walking around as people for more of the movie than the protagonists. They should have only popped in and out of frames, with empty spaces taking their place. Are they ghost demons or trailer park hobos? Seriously? They were made into odd humans with most of the usual human constraints. That's not terrifying. And what's with the hat? If that was the girl magician's and then appeared ONCE on the ghost thing, then yeah, good effect. Otherwise, nope. Trying too hard...yet surprisingly, not hard enough. Their evil doings were also repetitive. Do each parlour trick once, then never again.  Second, the girl was a little too cocky. The beauty of The Shining was that terrified tiny boy facing the horror pretty much alone. Take the girl down a notch. And make her younger or feebler. She ran like a track star. And why is that terrified boy-man now kind of robotically stoic? I think he should have a psyche more like the little boy when it comes to facing those things. After all, he's being jumped back into an episode from his past and will respond as though he was still that child. Why would he leave ""murder"" on his blackboard from one day to the next? Take it down. Watch it come back! And maybe lead into it with weird things which we don't get for a while. The new little boy stand-in didn't measure up to the original. The mothers, the same.  The original did a lot of mood setting. The sequel copy didn't. You have to take time to set the mood to bring the tension. And when the sequel copied the original (hall bike ride), it failed miserably by comparison. If you're going to copy perfection, you'd better get it right. The original made a big job out of setting the cold isolation of the locale, whereas the sequel didn't bother to establish the hot isolation of the first part of the movie. Too bad, because you can establish terrified isolation in a desert storm with limited water and visibility.¬†The move to the second location was a good one, but they could have taken more time in that location, not rushed through the mood-setting, and explored interesting new ways to expand on the original ideas. The duplication of the original jogged our memories, and was good, but they had to react in the setting a little more creatively. For a drunk (like his dad) he was still in control, which didn't serve the story of the Inn. He should have had big plans, then got sucked in and left the girl on her own. He knew this story. She didn't. Everything can't just function as planned. The building lit up and was intact. The car stayed on the entire time. The maze was perfect. What about if Danny had a plan based on his past and now everything was going against it, and the girl was left to improvise (but that's good because she wasn't stuck in a replay of the past like him)?",0,2,Elaine Morrison,BOzFZxB-8cw,0.08710743346160013,2019-11-08 22:58:37,False,True

It doesn't fit their characters is all i'm saying. It's almost as if they didn't want to be accused of white washing with Rose the Hat so they made Abra black which is some bs.

When you grow up in an elite family where you can do anything you can come up with, it will take you to places you never imagined. This is based on the small elite people who have discovered that when a child gets beyond scared. Beyond terrified. Beyond the pain you can fathom in your head. The child will secrete a hormone called adrenochrome. For the child to secreet it, it must be treated like these evil people in the movie for a period of time. The effects won't give you extended life but this is based on several kinds of ritual abuse. So Steven King mixed adrenochrome ritual and the blood harvesting of children to extend one's life. The latter is verified in mainstream articles but the first can only be researched by interviews with victims of S.R.A (satanic ritual abuse). Which has been suppressed as if only some testimony is valid and others are not.  The distinction is obviously dubious if enough research is done. The victims of SRA are treated as unreliable only because the perpetrators of their torment are usually in the highest social circles and leaders government and commercial industries.

2020-03-15T19:01:47,I have never read the shining or this one. Although I'm a Stephen King fan. I'm not a bookworm however his books was part of my childhood. Back in those days where I was bored as hell and reading was the only thing that can stimulate my brain.   Anyway the very first book that I've read was The Dreamcatcher. And when I watched this movie it brought back feelings of when I was reading that book. I've seen some of Stephen King's movie but this was the first time that a movie made me feel like I was reliving what I read. And it made me so happy honestly. This was like what I was imagining back then when I was reading his books.
