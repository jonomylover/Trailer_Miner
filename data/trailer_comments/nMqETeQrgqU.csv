Not the action, or the props, but the actual visuals of it. The over saturation of colors makes it look cartoonish and like a comedy. The reds are practically bleeding all over the place, while the teal filtered lights tell me it's some assholes attempt at ""color theory"".  It's probably going to have a ton of reference jokes and snarky humor that will permeate very scene, changing it from an action thriller filled with history between the characters and their world we saw in the first one.....into a ""lets make money while the fans still have a demand for the product"" bargain bin disaster.  This is the downside to being ""in the know"" of the film business as a writer, set designer, script supervisor, and special affects.
