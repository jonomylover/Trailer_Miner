Whereas if brad pitt offered to buy me a drink I'd smash it in his face, if Kevin did the same I'd actually consider drinking it. So I know a little about over the top shit. And his performances and films have not deteriorated over the years. The flick with amber heard, it did zilch at the BO but I loved it, and Kevin is actually charming as the killer company man trying to patch his life and family together with duct tape before he dies. It's hard to say this, but Kevin Costner actually has a little style, and he's not a tabloid magnet and doesn't appear to whore himself in public. Who knows what goes on in the back. At least for public consumption he's a bonafide movie star.
