Also the cast bothers me I don't mind Ted himself and Mark wahlberg wass good in the first one, but here's the thing the new cast and making side characters and main characters side characters. Amanda seyfreid I just don't like she just seems bland and not funny, the girl who plays Tammy lin is just a replacement for Mila kunis, also why is Morgan Freeman in this they could've hired anyone else and it wouldn't have made a difference.

2015-02-04T14:14:08,"Did you know?: a group of linguists found that the English language was the best language in the world.   The Cornell-Bentley Research   A few years ago, a group of linguists carried out a research to find out the linguistic qualities of modern languages and the intellectual characterisitcs of their speakers. The research was based on a number of parameters (example:  economy of language, lexico grammatical simplicity and lexical richness). The study also included an inquiry into the psycholinguistic feeding produced by subjects from different parts of the world. The scientists concluded that the English language as spoken in the last two decades of the 20th century had outstanding qualities, standing out from the rest of the languages in the world. In addition, they reported that this language was necessarily the communication means of highly-evolved, highly-civilized human beings. According to the scientists, the evidence showed that the English language was beyond the expected standards, and that the speakers who originated this language had massive neuronal connections at the level of the cortex and a high rate of intercommunication between the cerebral hemispheres at the level of corpus callosum. On the other hand, languages like Spanish and Italian were below the linguistic standards -therefore they called them “low-level languages”- and their speakers showed weaker cerebral settings. After the results of this study were known, certain economic and political corporations strongly forbade the scientists from revealing either the details of the study or its results. Seemingly, the corporations fear that this study may cause socio-political distress in non-English-speaking countries, leading to an eventual fall in the exportation/importation flow of English-speaking countries. As a result, this research is not available in the Internet or any other place, representing a real breach of the right of free speech guaranteed by the American constitution. Because of this, a group of citizens concerned with this situation decided to launch a campaign against this breach of rights and are currently making this study known to the world.",0,0,arkox8,S3AVcCggRnU,0.10447916666666666,2015-02-04 14:14:08,True,True

Kathryn realized that I was champing at the bit to talk with you all. We are all whooping and shouting on the ship - this was a hit! * First, I want to let everyone know that the passengers on Flight 370 are perfectly happy to spend time in Hollow Earth. And when they return, they will have enough story to tell. They will be interviewed on television, and all stations will want to find out where they were and how it happened. * In the event that the cigar-shaped UFO that now assigned to hover over every conflict on the planet, if not done enough impact, when the people return from Hollow Earth are they going to give everyone an earful. * Now they know all about our plans galactic, and how eager we are to end the war. They were more than happy that the idea will be the poster children for peace on earth. They asked us to please use them as a ""hostage"" to create leverage, to insist that governments around the world, not only have to deliver all their WMD, but also accept promulgating a law NESARA around the world, in every country. * Now, this may take a bit 'of confrontation and negotiation, and we had to wait a couple of days, while thousands of people, ships, helicopters, etc, from 12 or 14 different countries, scour the ocean in search of evidence that crashed - which of course will not find. They took a couple of bottles of plastic or something, and I thought this might be a test. Of course there is no evidence because there was no plane crash. We picked up the plane, as we did before, took to Hollow Earth, and all are safe and sound. It 'a shame that families suffer, and we wanted to end quickly. If any of you know someone in Malaysia or China, if you know any of the families, please get the information to them: families are safe and sound in the loving hands of the Galactic Federation of Light (GFL). They have good food and wine (even if you do not drink wine, but they have better replacements); they are well cared for and that they are having the time of their lives. And, you know, none of them has led to a pterodactyl! * There is more enthusiasm and I will give you another bit 'of information. Many had their cell phones with them, and we also have their luggage, with their adapters, and so on. We are able to leverage the networks, so eventually they will be able to send messages to their loved ones. First, though, these crews that are sure that they will find some evidence, must finish patrolling the entire Asian continent. There are stories of ""perhaps the airline turned and went throughout Malaysia"", but of course it did not. It 'very evident on the radar that our ships were just off the coast, anticipating ... we actually chose this airliner is due to the group of passengers who were there. When we captured the airliner, we were very careful. There was no damage to the airliner or the passengers or crew. Hardly heard a bump. We can pick up and carry a large airliner without problems; our ships are huge. We were disguised planes are as fit as we flew across Malaysia to position ourselves closely enough to catch the plane. It suddenly disappears from the radar. You have seen; have seen. Those radar images have been deleted, but thanks to the internet you have all now. Many have posted; so many have now that they can not remove. There is evidence. * Yes, we need a new name for our ships over UFO. We are not 'unidentified'; we are flying objects, I suppose, but we need another term. As of Federation ships? We no longer have the space, we are here at your atmosphere, even if it originated from the whole universe. Let me tell you our plan. We intend to use the ships cigar-shaped, that it was over Ukraine which was filmed and published all over the world, too. There will be the best films to come. Of course, there are trouble spots around the world that are not easy for our light workers to reach, or for film crews, either. Syria, Somalia, there are journalists more Americans there. You will notice that wherever a conflict kicks, you will see this ship, and people will start to associate any type of warmongering, every conflict and / or the withdrawal of troops, with the appearance of our ships. Already Putin is taking his troops to their barracks - a wise decision on his part. And now, if necessary, we will begin lasering some tanks or weapons - never when there's no one around, of course. There are many areas of outdoor storage, and we can only merge some tanks or weapons, and see if this hits the news. * There are a couple of pictures on the Internet shows that we have already destroyed underground storage facilities that held the weapons of types that you might not even be aware of. They are dead now, but do not see it on the news, right? It 's interesting how you can suppress this. You might think it would be that it would be big news, if you deleted a post of 600 'storage in possession of all kinds of weapons. You would think that if many were destroyed this attracts the attention of the local news. It created quite a flash! They managed to suppress that too, and they give you an idea of ​​who controls the media. Obviously we will put an end to this. We had to work around it ... you liked our intelligent use of the old Turner Network, and seems like a nice way to start. As I said in the message of Kathryn the other night, it was sort of an elbow in the ribs to Ted Turner, hoping to sign up and help get the word out. But, as you said, there is no information on his desk, or that of the people on the ground. * Let's see, where do I get to let you in on more of our information. Many have read our message and I want to fill you in a bit '. There is of course a great connection between the ship-shaped cigar and flight 370 and the introduction of the law NESARA, which will shift the entire planet to a new way of governing. We are so excited, we are out of us on this occasion. We had to get on our hands because of the new blackout. We're not ready to take over all the stations, as we promised; that is coming, though. * We wanted to make this a little 'more gradual. The capture of the flight, the announcement of the UFO, and his abilities ... you know that this story has been handed over the line and that there are now a number of military leaders who have apoplexy for being packaged in a corner. What can you do now? Dare not ignore it? They will try to do this for a while '. Have the courage to ignore an airliner that disappeared so close - there is a link, ask. Well of course there is! Now, some of them are always our infamous description of awesome weapons that is available on this ship. Of course, we never use our rays to wipe out entire villages and repopulate them - of course this is nonsense, but it sounds pretty scary, is not it, especially for the cabal, because that is exactly what they would like to be able to do . You bet they are jealous! And appreciate the power and absolute control that is possible when you have this technology. This is the way the mind works here on planet earth, because the thought of all was contaminated by the cabal, the paranoia and the way they operate in the dark, and the constant control and who is going to control what? * We do not see ourselves as control anyone. We offer our strength, the technology that we have developed over millions of years, and we offer for your protection, well-being and the good of all. We offer you to help you get your freedom. We are happy to do this, finally, for the inhabitants of the planet earth. We do this by agreement with Prime Creator and various Councils which have consulted on these things for centuries. We finally gave the green light to help out. * As you can tell, we used sparingly. Our help was subtle and suggestive, but not at anyone until now. It 's time to make it clear, and I can tell you that we had a good time writing that piece, creating to show the world what an impressive ship and what we can, and as we listen better because now all those puny little arms also secret governments of the US and the European families with their intake of strangulation on the planet for centuries ... you can bet they were experiencing shock and awe, because they produced nothing even comes close to what we have and what we take for granted, because we had this technology for eons - long enough to know that you can not keep the peace by waging war. We have no intention to intervene in a war; we've never done on planet earth. We do not intervene in your wars, or bless one side or another. Let us prove ourselves to remind people what they are doing is dangerous and unacceptable. * We have a program now that every time there is a 'duck-duck' of the planet, it does transpire that people are seeing the UFO-shaped cigar. Now there are websites on this UFO, get the information, and at the end everyone will know about it. In the next step, we are trying to create an environment where we will contact all the leaders of all countries and let them know (especially those with citizens on the floor) that we are open to negotiate with them, and that the passengers will be released when they signed the NESARA law in their country. As soon as it comes out, that will be the next challenge. We will need a little 'help in this. * As soon as the world understands that will not be returned the ""hostage"" until the law was signed into effect, people will start to chaos. Fall all over themselves to negotiate ... or drag your feet ... or agree, but do not actually sign it. We know all their tricks and put under pressure. Of course we are not taking passengers against their will, and if they want to go home, we will send them. But many are determined to stay out until the last card is signed because they are happy to be the ones that will bring peace to the world. Now they are diplomats or representatives of their countries, and if we do not get some action you hear of some of them. Have spoken out, are well spoken, are dedicated, and they really understand the importance of this project. It 'an exciting time! It 'a very exciting time! There are many levers to pull and negotiations to be organized, and there are ways of dealing with this delicate, so we do not expect any of you to go out in the mid - and **** and start talking about this in terms hysterical. We are proceeding with caution, respect to all concerned. There are real threats, but as you can tell, we wrote a letter involves a threat implied. We are saying to the world that we will no longer allow the destructiveness and bad behavior that has been the norm. * This is my update for you all. I hope you understand. I repeat it as many times as necessary: ​​we do it for the good of all, for the whole planet, and we do it with love in our hearts, because we are your brothers and sisters. We hold you in our hearts as precious. We know that you have suffered, and we want to help put an end to it. Think not that I am saying to you that we are going to take over. Not so. We are not taking more than anything or anyone. We offered our help and at any time the passengers decide they do not want to be involved in this, they will be taken home ... but we're not going to advertise this. * The world does not understand how we operate; many of you do not understand, because in our negotiations is the depth of love, respect and care for all involved. We do not make war or create division. This is why we have taken this kind of diplomacy. We do not take sides, we simply try to arrange things so that no one is hurt. Even the dark ones who have created the problems will be given the opportunity to come forward and seek help. We are happy to give. We have no intention of creating dissent. Think deeply about what we have told you and you will see how carefully thought this is. We have created the opportunity for people to come forward, be brave, bring light and join with us. We offer our help with an invitation to join us, and of course that means the final invitation to the surface for people to join the Galactic Federation of Light. You have not been a part until now; the planet was under the control of the cabal, and we are not allowed in the Federation. Now Mother Earth will be given the opportunity to join us at the end. Naturally Hollow Earth Hollow Earth and are already members, and now it is finally able to join us. * So look in your hearts when you read these messages and try to understand what we are doing. Do not assume this is a lie or a trick. I Have Not! You know that every game of strategy, and we have seen a bit 'strategy on our part, that's all. If you were a football coach, you teach them some games intricate, and this is what we did. We are on the side of Light, and our intentions are to bring peace and love that we experience in the higher dimensions. We wish you well, and love and happiness and joy. We are here to stand by your side, and bring you the glorious paradise that was promised. You have made this possible! Do not find yourself the spread on the Internet, ""Oh, that's a lie; it can not be true, because I can not believe it!"" Why can not it be true? Just because it has not happened before does not mean it is not true. It took a long time, but we are building momentum, all together - not only those of us in the higher realms or on ships, but all together have momentum. You can feel it happening. We crossed the line. There will be no more nuclear war, the destruction of the planet Earth, or the need to save everyone on the planet, because they are in danger. The plan has changed! There will be the Armageddon; that is going to be every day brighter and more fun. * So I come to reassure and encourage you, to cheer you up and help change this direction saying ""Oh, this does not match with what someone said here, and so it must be lies!"" Do not be silly. People see this from different perspectives. Look for the light and successes; look for the real change is happening, why it is happening all over the world. Note that disasters are waning. Yes, you can still see some vapor in the sky, but those are just the leftovers. People think they are creating and controlling the disease, but does not work. There will be a plague; We will not allow nuclear war. You work with us; together we are creating this. Watch, listen, be aware, and put his shoulder to the wheel. Be part of the solution, as you say! Being part of hope, not what they say, ""I am a skeptic, and I'm going to deny everything Criminal Ashtar says, and these horrible people who say there is a whole through the center of the earth!"" * Ignore these people. Do not read that stuff. Listen to your heart. Let raised. And 'everything happens! Unfortunately, you do not need a media to tell you about it. There is no support they will tell you about the news, so do not count on this. There are sources on the internet, and these channels; listen carefully. Together with the words, we send vibrations to help lift yourself. This is all about Ascension, dear. It is only to raise your vibration, and if you break down someone else, they are not raising their vibration. Join uplifting yourself; leave behind the fear and suspicion that make you doubt everything that sounds good. It is not skepticism, this is just close-minded. Look into your heart and ask: ""I'm just desperate to be negative because I have experienced this before?"" Well, it's understandable if you've been disappointed or had a hard life. I assure you, we are working hard on your behalf, and our beloved St Germain, which has been much maligned recently, he worked day and night to help. We have to have quick footwork to keep up with the cabal; that was our goal, our challenge and our triumph. * It would have been nice if everything could have happened December 21, 2012. Not all happened that day, but that was the beginning of the watershed. It 'been gaining momentum since then, this wonderful ride that will end in your Ascension. That is not an end, but the beginning of a new life. I hope I have encouraged and reassured; Hopefully, progress has been made, the surprises are just around the corner, and if you have an open mind and a sense of humor, is delighted with what we have in Serbia. Be ready laugh, cheer, celebrate and dance in the streets. There are wonderful things that are. Open your hearts and minds, and not try to understand the basis of all that you have experienced before. It will rate more interesting, complex and wonderful than you can imagine! I will now let my brother St Germain to speak with you, and God the Father as well. Mother God has transformed into 'boys for tonight. There are teachers here with us, and the power of women is rising, and we rely on the women to bring their messages to those on the ground. We have a powerful team so effective, and all of you are part of it. Salut, all; I am, Ashtar.",0,0,Angel fotonic light cosmic,S3AVcCggRnU,0.20591835215361168,2015-02-18 22:55:11,True,True
