2013-12-12T19:01:25,"    It seems like Tyler Perry is trying very hard to make a crossover movie. It looks as though he's trying to win the support of the critics, while, at the same time leaving his original fan base in the dust. My conjecture is that he's doing this either because his movie sales are waning or because LG is pressuring him to do so. I, however, think it's the former because although his movies are still doing well, they aren't debuting at the #1 spot they always has.       Nevertheless, this movie looks good, but I don't get the excitement, seeing his trailers, I use to get from his earlier movies; I'll pass until the DVD release. Hopefully, by then, Tyler will bring back the kind of drama that made him famous. ",0,0,David Oliver,WQNOvfixtpo,0.16325757575757577,2013-12-12 19:01:25,True,True

2014-02-09T10:47:39,"I saw another thread on facebook where comments automatically bashed and made comments like ""smh"" and speaking against the movie as if it is wrong to celebrate ""single motherhood"". I don't believe single motherhood is the ideal situation and as a single mother, I would never promote this type of lifestyle. It is hard as heyell shouldering all of the responsibilities alone. However, I can't understand for the life of me how some people seem to harp on or go into full attack at the very mention of celebrating a single mom. It almost sounds like hatred to me. What kills me is no one has actually seen the movie yet and when I saw the trailer, I didn't see anything problematic except for the fat black funny woman stereotype. All those that want to preach that single mother status is not ideal and shouldn't be celebratory, we get it...however, I disagree that mothers like me should crawl into a hole never to be heard from again and act as if we don't have a story to tell just like everyone else. Grant it, Tyler Perry is not the ideal person I would want to tell the story...but at least he is out there trying to tell someone's story. I don't get the full attack on Tyler Perry either. No, I'm not a huge fan, but I don't get why he has become a target when I see so many other writers and directors making equally offensive movies towards black women. The only hang up with Tyler Perry is his movies are poorly made and poorly directed as  well as the actors and actresses seem to lose all acting abilities in his films.  ",7,0,Shun Jackson,WQNOvfixtpo,0.0035714285714285718,2014-02-09 10:47:39,True,True

And please spare me the ""what if her husband dies"" crap. No one can predict death. And this is still not a situation to be admired - it's tragic and unfortunate, that's it.  In this order:  1. Abstinence. if that doesn't work for her, then 2. Birth control. If the idiot boyfriend doesn't want to wear a condom then tell him to get the hell out of your face. 3. A two parent family. And if that can't happen, then 4. Good co-parenting with constant communication between the parents.  Anything else is lunacy.

The ""Oh girlfriend."" The one frying chicken in pan full of fat, yes that stereotype.  Ask yourself, how many black women do you know speak in such a manner?  Movies like this gives non-black people cause to say things such as, ""hey girlfriend"" to a black woman that they don't know (which by the way happened to me).  I personally do not speak this way and it's really confusing to me how perfect strangers think that it is okay to address another person with ""hey girlfriend.""  Unfortunately, people make assumptions and this movie progresses the wrong assumptions.   At this point in society, it's really annoying and I am offended as a Black Woman.  Needless to say, I wont be seeing this.  I would rather watch smart movies like 12 Years a Slave and see black people who speak properly versus this mockery. ",1,0,honey kist,WQNOvfixtpo,-0.02313492063492063,2014-03-27 16:46:28,False,True

2015-06-27T15:09:49,I sat through this whole movie wondering why they tried to add soooooo much comedy into it when the movie could have thrived better as a drama. It had grewt character depth and background stories. This movie had so much potential but it fell flat on its face ahd I'm sad for it.

Not all black women love thugs, and not all single women with kids are on welfare and are just god awful gold diggers. I live with my mother, a single mother; she has a degree and makes six figures with two kids alone. People put these stereotypes on other because they don't even know... this whole movie is showing that there is more out there than the stereotype, but people always judge at first glance...",5,1,Karielle Cyrus,WQNOvfixtpo,0.007265512265512279,2015-08-10 21:56:04,False,False
