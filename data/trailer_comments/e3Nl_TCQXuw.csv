2017-01-31T05:16:45,"People are bitching about this being a cash grab and nothing new being added and to the story, and to those people, I say: First, Hollywood is a business. Big film studios will make movies that are commercially viable first and foremost. If people pay to see them, they really don't care what the critics and moviegoers have to say about it. Why else would Warner Brothers keep making DC movies? Why else would Pixar make yet another Cars movie? Why else would they keep chugging out Star Wars movies, or multiple Marvel movies every year? God knows the blockbuster market is crowded as hell, but the ticket sales make it worth it. Secondly, they're adding three new songs, a new character, and new backstories for both Belle and the Beast. This movie is supposedly going to be 30-40 minutes longer than the original animated film. They have to make enough change so that it seems slightly different, but not too different to the point where the story is unrecognizable. Also, none of you have seen the finished film, so give it the benefit of the doubt. I'm optimistic. I see a few new things in this trailer that I'm excited about.

Belle is everything I want to be-independent, creative, intelligent, brave, loving and caring at all times. Ever since I was little I wished Disney would recapture this beautiful story in live action film, and now I have my wish. I was a little scared at the first announcement that it was finally happening, but with Emma and Dan carrying these roles I have faith that it will not let me down.

For example if we'd seen just until Belle meets the Beasts, I'm sure that'd be enough for people to get excited and see it or when she meets everyone in the castle. Besides people are forgetting that there are newer generations of children who have probably never seen the original or simply haven't grown with Disney classics. You want a fantastic trailer that shows and tells just enough to reel you in but not spoil the whole movie? Watch American Pastoral the trailer.

It's just that in the older version the lines 'Barely even friends then somebody bends unexpectedly' are sung beautifully, not just that one line but every word completely captures the moment and meaning of their relationship. That feeling is lost in the persuit of making the song sound larger and dramatic. The song's beauty was it's clarity, that it had few instruments yet it felt big.

They could have done it even beastlier, just a glance at the effects in el laberintho del Fauno and Hellboy proves it, or I don't know, the whole Rick Baker legacy. Even parts of action scenes could be amazing with a stunt double on stilts. Don't know with actual wolves but still. Anyway, parts are not too bad, I like gaston and his mirror and his lovely flowers. And Kevin Kline seems awesome, but even simple shots like the one were she comes out of the house scream Lazy Town to me (gaston is their robbie rotten lol).

I've already wrote how its going to be like.  Goldy Lock's ran away from home (This would be a great idea to show running away from home is dangerous in real life espicially at night.) She went into the forrest (This will be based in this centurary) she thought she was meeting up with her (so called) boyfriend but he stood her up or he was waiting (Mind you this forrest is huge) and so she waited then about an hour she got mad and searched for him then it suddenly turnt night she tried finding her way home but she got lost ages ago she finally came across this cottage she ran up there and shouted she look into a window it was pitch black and no one was home she opened the door (The door was crookeed and made a creeek sound like in horror films.) She said ""Hello"" really quietly. she found a lamp and she turnt it on then she found a fire place and matches she lit the fireplace then she went into the kitchen and you know hoe the story goes lol at the end the bears (No they dont speak human talk 😂) Came in after she fooled around in their house and she heard a (Grrrr) She hid from them then they entered the bedroom from upstairs she was hiding in a closet then when they went downstairs she ran out of the window then heard her and ran after her she was running for her life in the night in the forrest whilst the 3 bears chased after her she climbed up a tree and said to herself ""I cant escaped if theyre behind my tail ive got to either out smart them or kill them 1 by 1 ""(so she played like Katniss from hunger games) she trapped 1 then killed it then she heard the other 2 coming up closer to her so she crafted a spear and threw it from above the trees on one of the other bears whilst it was still alive she went down and smashed its head in with a huge rock whilst scared and crying then she ran for her life trying to find her way out then when she suddenly sore a light from the distance she heard the last bear (Daddy bear) rawr like really loud so she ran towards the light she came across a road then just when the bear was about to get her it got hit by a meat truck whilst she was sat on the floor scared she picked herself up and ran back to her home she sore police cars and everything she went and hugged her parents and said ""i will never run away ever again"" then she went on instagram and got a text from her boyfriend saying (Im at the woods where are you?) and she cried so much saying out loud NOOO!! and realised the bears mustve got to him and the film ends when she texts him back saying (Im sorry im so so sorry) as like a goodbye because she thought he mustve died then whilst she was curled up in her bed crying she went to sleep and then her phone went (bing)!!

I'm excited to explore these characters in greater depths than the animated film got to explore, and with an over 2 hour run-time it looks like we'll be getting that and then some. The new songs look like they are going to join the ranks of some of Disney's best in their ever-growing hit catalog, and with such talent as Celine Dion and Josh Groban how can you go wrong?

The dress looks better now than before (but not as good as they made Cinderella's).

2017-01-31T22:19:21,"Net neutrality has become an issue over the past few year that is being discussed more and more, a new law passed that will help the common people from having to overpay for the internet service. This law is called the net neutrality bill, this bill has classified the internet as a utility and therefore the internet service providers cannot charge extra to creator or consumers that use it. Net Neutrality is the principle that internet service providers should enable access to all content and application, regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites. However, the internet service providers wanted to start charging to put content onto the internet and charging to access it. Bundling internet which is mandatory network sharing. I believe that unrestricted internet access, without fees and extra cost to the end user or the content creator, will help the internet keep growing and advancing into the next generation, and allow the economy to grow without restrictions with companies like Google and Amazon.              The internet is a vast computer network linking smaller networks worldwide including commercial, educational, government, and other networks, all of which use the same set of communications protocols (""The Definition of Internet.""). Throughout the past 20 years the internet has boomed to take over almost every task that needs to be done. The internet holds information for people ranging from how to fix common everyday problems to how to solve some of the world’s most difficult math equations. This shows how diverse of an audience uses the internet on a regular basis. Still, the internet is still in its infancy stages because still there are many things that it can’t do for the normal consumer. All of this is still possible because the companies have left it alone for the most part letting the people decide how and what the people want to upload onto it, and what the end consumer wants to access. More recently, some of the major Internet service providers have thought about only allowing certain website run at their full potential while the rest will be throttled down to a nearly unusable speed, unless the consumer pays a premium to access the content at the normal speed.  This point was covered wonderfully by the article “Net Neutrality and Investment Incentives” in which they said  “There are two content providers who compete to deliver content to end users. Under net neutrality, the ISP cannot discriminate between content providers in the delivery speed of contents. For simplicity, let us assume that under net neutrality the ISP provides content providers with the network line at no charge. In contrast, without net neutrality regulation, preferential treatment for a particular content provider is no longer prohibited. Then, the ISP can sell the Örst-priority, the right to be served ahead of the other, to either one of the two content providers. As will be explained in further detail, we adopt a general framework that can capture various manners in which the Örst priority can be sold. In this sense, we consider access-tiring as a practice that violates network neutrality, instead of port blocking or quality degradation. ( Pil Choi)”              If The United States didn’t establish the internet as a utility the Internet Service Providers would have free control on what speeds should be set for certain people going to certain websites. These companies would have the ability to charge extra for the uploading content onto the internet. There is a great point made in “Net Neutrality, Unbundling, and their Effects on International Investment in Next-Generation Networks” where the author discusses how the broadband providers will have control over the quickness of one website and the slowness of another  “So, for example, a broadband  provider  selling  its  own  video  on  demand  may  have  an  incentive  to  degrade  service quality of a company trying to sell a similar service online.( Scott W.).” With a system like this a website can create a monopoly by making sure that the other video streaming sites will be slow while theirs will be the only one to stream high quality video online. All of this is perfectly described in article written by Scott J., Wallsten, and Stephanie in which they say-              “Net neutrality debates in the U.S. have focused primarily on regulations regarding how broadband providers could price and manage traffic on their networks. The debate in Europe, and the EU in particular, has generally focused instead on the role unbundling – mandatory network sharing – can play in keeping networks neutral. Unbundling proponents argue that if the infrastructure provider does not offer retail services or is only one of many retailers offering service over its infrastructure it will have less incentive to discriminate in favor of or against particular content. Unbundling opponents typically do not discuss it in the context of net neutrality, but note that it can reduce incentives to invest in the underlying infrastructure (Scott p.3).”              Another way the Internet Service providers will get incentives will be because they don’t have to deal with unbundling their services. While net neutrality has been discussed for many years in the United States while mandatory unbundling has barely been touched on. Most countries to all nations heavily rely on their internet service provider to give them fair and open access to watch TV and check their email on their PC by using the internet. But, when it comes to certain internet providers the only way to get it is by subscribing for a cable service as well that will go unused, which ultimately over charges the customer. The graph following this paragraph displays how over saturated the United States market is with cable compared with other countries where there is usually less than half if not less than a third of their market is for cable.  Like all things, there will be flaws that could be pointed out and this argument has some. The first being that even if America manages to unbundle there will wouldn’t necessarily be a change where incentives facing this Service Provider if the Service Provider still controls the infrastructure in which the data travels through.  And the second point being that the mandatory unbundling can affect incentives to invest in the network by reducing the potential returns to that investment. Another great point made by “Net Neutrality, Unbundling, and their Effects on International Investment in Next-Generation Networks” is-   “Most countries to all nations heavily rely on their internet service provider to give them fair and open access to watch TV and check their email on their PC by using the internet. But, when it comes to certain internet providers the only way to get it is by subscribing for a cable service as well that will go unused, which ultimately over charges the customer.   All of this is clearly proven because in the UK and many other countries their internet does not have a cap on it and in Switzerland there is no bottlenecking the data speeds. It is about time that US took a stance in the right direction.  After all of this the consumer is stuck with bottlenecked (limited due to ISP) speeds on their internet. Alongside, data caps throttle the speeds way down once they are hit.”              One of the main cons concerning an internet service that runs on the back of cable, is that the bandwidth is limited to the speed of a coax cable. While Google is coming out with Google Fiber, which is a faster and over all better solution to today’s problem with internet. The problem today is that the speeds that most people get throughout the day vary a lot, which means when some the whole neighborhood sits down in the afternoon to watch some Netflix it affects everyone’s speeds throttling down everyone to low quality. With this method everyone suffers even if one person on the line is even downloading something.

I ve watched B&B countless times, I ve played it for my nieces and nephews even more times, so I can say from my heart it is one of my favorite disney movies. BUT... the objects look weird not at all like the animation. And keep in mind that since they are doing a live action of the animation I would except these things to be kept the same . Chip is supposed to be cute .... I get creativity and changing things to make it a live action movie but from all the trailers I am not sold in these changes... Also the Beast... nope he doesnt look like him at all...  I like Emma , she is a good actress and she has a good (ok) voice I guess but it doesnt cause the same awe no matter what people say.

Possible false flag events to take place around the super bowl weekend. Feb. 4th/5th.This year will be unlike any other. Put your faith in God and come to him to be saved. Roman 10:9 John 3:16 Repent of all sins and ask Jesus to come into your heart and set you free from this world and satans power through sin. Jesus is the only way to heaven! John 14:6Gods restraining hands are about to be removed. Hell is coming to earth.There will be great fear and chaos and devestation all over. But there is no fear of this if you put your faith in Christ right now! Today is the day of salvation! The hours are numbered... * ""Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life.

Please, please support! I'm working on lot's of projects mostly travel and culture related, but I also cover other important or interesting things.   My site is non politically opinionated so we can all find common ground through similar interests but however, I will occasionally post footage of big events if I'm near them regardless of the events politics, such as protests and rallies. (These stay off my Facebook page and will stay off my website, but I only have the one YouTube account, so I like to share that type of thing because people find it interesting and for extra publicity.)   A  website for Urgency Lifestyle is also under construction, where I want everyone to be able to post up and share pictures and comments about places in their area and places they visit and recommend, so please get involved with the social media sites I have up now to stay updated!

And for them this new live action version is amazing?i think disney does a wonderful job in attracking this new generation to embrace the classic fairy tales also makes our dream come true (the 90's generation) in making this live action  And for the cast, i think no one should looks exactly the same like the animation. If you really want to stick with ""the look"" and really idealistic about that , then all the disney princesses always a big round eyes (except mulan of course), because that is animation...lily james is not exactly like the animation of cinderella, cinderalla has chubby cheek,high cheek bones, but i think she portrays cinderella perfectly And for those who complaining that why not anne hathaway or emmy rossum whou should play belle, come on guys..they are exceptional beauty but they look too mature to portray belle..we know that belle is still a teenage  The accent? Even the animation version use american accent. Why don't you complain about that?  Why this movie is racist? Do you know the cast of plummete is gugu mbatha raw?i think she is beautiful african woman  We all have our opinion, but let's just enjoy this, embrace this dream come true, and appreciate all people behind this magnificent movie because they did such an incredible job.this is just my opinion, sorry for my nad english  Have aniceday everyone 😬",3,0,23mecy23,e3Nl_TCQXuw,0.18025757575757578,2017-02-02 10:15:11,True,True

2017-02-03T08:47:59,I'm very in shocked reading the bad critics. I really do.  Let me ask you something... How made the Beauty and the Beast original movie in 1991? DISNEY.  How is the only one who can decide what to do with it then? DISNEY.  So... French actors? Worse singers? Emma Watson not beautiful?  That's his problem. I really do trust in Disney. And I always will be.  The only thing you have to do is to forget this movie of your mind and not going to the theater. Problem solved.

2017-02-05T04:32:09,"I'm not really a fan of this version of the song which is a shame cause beauty and the beast is one of my favorite movies and I love Ariana Grande and John Legend but something just seems off. I don't know why, maybe it doesn't sound as heartfelt and romantic.  They sound like their just singing the lyrics not feeling them if that makes sense. when I listen to the original I can believe that the singers are actually in love and are simply singing their hearts out to each other. I don't feel that with John and Ari. It's still good and they're both very talented but I prefer the original. I can't wait for the new movie though.  I'm really loving that disney is making live-action versions of their classics. my fingers are crossed for Aladdin to be the next remake.",1,0,Jassiepoohbear,e3Nl_TCQXuw,0.30419786096256685,2017-02-05 04:32:09,True,True

Now that it's 2017 Disney can present a magical movie filled with real actors and actresses because of how far CGI and computer's have come in general. The Cinderella movie was much more interesting and appealing as a live action film vs the classic IMO. Although these classics can not be replaced I have a feeling in generations to come these will become the staple. Simply beautiful and Ariana and John really didn't let us down. Celine and Peabo did amazing and so did this new generation of musical entertainers.

Sorry to say but Hermione does not have that so necessary glow as a person or a character. Also, she just looks way too young and immature. Yes, I know Bell is suppose to be young, but good God does she look young in this Movie. Another thing, why does the Beast look so ""human"". Awful. And the main reason I WON'T be watching this Disney Cash-Cow is because of Gaston. Holy Shit, you guys should have had Dwayne Johnson or something because seriously, what did they do to him? Gaston is known as the biggest and strongest among men, and yet we have him in this movie looking average joe as F---. To preserve my childhood  and my love for the original movie, I will NOT be watching this force-fed b.s. by Disney. Disney has become a cash cow corporation that gains money and power on the manipulation of youth minds (reference the young female stars that always by an amazing coincidence all grow up to be sex symbols).

2017-02-25T13:07:45,This movie is twice as long so i think they showed the parts from the original even if it still had a few changes. Some people have problem with emma as belle and others like emma as belle.I Honestly think emma watson without a doubt make a great belle  but others dont.I read some youtube comments and some people think that that emma watson wont make a good belle though and i think just as much as people like emma watson for this role or movie in general people are allowed to have those felling but i dont think person should be arguing over a movie.And its Okay if you dosagree cause it is only a Movie and there would be plenty more in the future,6,0,Universal/warnerbrother V Disney,e3Nl_TCQXuw,0.2895833333333333,2017-02-25 13:07:45,True,True

And the moments I didn't care about turned out to be very great. And the waltz was one moment that just didn't seem romantic to me. It was very disappointing to me.  I thought belle barely EVER showed any emotions! When she sings belle reprise she just stands there. No emotion no hand waving or lying in the grass. Just standing. So boring!  I thought the movie was fine overall and surprised me in a good way with the songs BUT I left the theater feeling no epic-ness whatsoever. In the animated version I get the feels every time.

I'm sorry. I really, really love. But ok. I have to say that to me she is largely overrated. She did not have the strength and the delicacy, the courage and the sweetness of the character of Belle, her intelligence, her rebellious spirit, her force as a woman who loves.  Ok... The director said ""I don't want the princess, I want the woman, it's not a tale, it's a story"". BAH! Walking with a book and  Watching the library with big eyes it's not enough to say that Belle is emancipated and a free and innovative spirit...i know that this actress is a kind of symbol, she is and she is represented as the actress who wants to emancipate girls with herself and what she does, trough her art... But I really think she needs to develop better her talent from the Hermione character... What I saw today is a Hermione, with a lower profile, in a yellow dress. No character's magic, no development, no intelligence, no mistery... Nothing... Only the same one expression...  This film is overrated. Ok, the special effects were WOW, but the only one character who really works maybe it's Gaston (but not so much...).  What about the ""plus"" that the real film had to bring to this story? I see thousands of steps back. I found ridiculous that the great story, the magic, the real life, the poetry, the sense of a bright future... the real sense of this story, the angst and the courage, the sadness and the happiness, the great characters, their personalities and spirits work better IN A CARTOON than I a film with REAL PEOPLE.

We learn a bit more about Belles fathers back story, and at times the movie really gets your adrenaline pumping. There are a few new songs, one of which I was just thinking 'please end this song now!' but overall it was beautifully shot. Much less 'polished' and more 'busy' feeling. I felt the prologue was a bit rushed, and the iconic ballroom scene was a bit 'meh' but there were definitely one or two moments where my jaw dropped and i think Disney was brave to add the violence which they did. It's certainly quite dark in places, which I loved! I didn't see Hermione Granger. I saw Belle, and personally I think Emma did a great job of bringing belle to life.

She placed an order and BEFORE even getting her food, the server asked to swipe her card. 40 minutes into the movie and still no food while the other guests are being served. She continued to press the service button until finally, a male server came by. He completely IGNORED her when she asked if her order was placed and by the end of the movie, STILL NO FOOD. The same server who took her original order came by and said she would get a manager but NEVER CAME BACK. By the end of the credits, still NO ONE. and NO MANAGER. She exits the Bistro with my brothers and asks a staff member for a manager because she was charged but didn't receive her order. He asked if her server was AFRICAN AMERICAN. (Her server was NOT African American. And why does the server's RACE MATTER?) He tells her he's busy and can't get her a manager then turns away. She repeats herself and FINALLY he goes to get one but NEVER RETURNS. She goes to find a DIFFERENT staff member who asks the SAME QUESTION. ""WAS YOUR SERVER AFRICAN AMERICAN?"" And he goes to find the server that took her order but NEVER COMES BACK EITHER. Then FINALLY the manager comes. All the manager says is, ""We are very busy and have over 500 people to serve."" WAS SHE NOT ONE OF YOUR GUESTS TO SERVE??? And when my mom asked why her card was swiped in the beginning, the manager says ""we swipe cards for people who might eat and LEAVE."" (We are asian by the way) Did my mother LOOK LIKE THE TYPE WHO WASN'T GOING TO PAY? BASED ON RACE??? I am appalled and disgusted by the way my MOTHER WAS TREATED!!!

And after that Belle went to the rose. And saw no petals left. Then there was an old woman. The old woman was the one who made the cruel prince the beast. The prince that i am talking about is the beast. The old woman just transformed the cruel prince the beast cause the prince was mean. Days after days the beast was turning into a kind beast. then all the alive objects turned back into normal people again.

2017-03-25T03:48:15,"I thought everything about the movie was quite good.  Spent about half of it holding back tears because I kept remembering my daughter, at that time about 7 years old, watching the original film with me.  She has a great voice and knows every single lyric.  Finally lost it during the big love-song dance.  The beginning scene was utterly remarkable, as was the ending.  Still, there are a couple of things that bothered me.  First, the one character that wasn't ""fleshed"" out for me enough was Belle.  Emma Watson seemed to spend half the movie attempting to get into the role, really feel it as the other character actors were doing, but never quite got there.  I can't help but feel there were any number of female actors that might have pulled it off better.  The Beast couldn't be improved on.  Gaston's character about stole the show; very well thought out and as much quality time in the film as Belle's character.  Tons of meat in the entire portrayal.  Put another way, compare Gaston to Belle and it seems the movie revolved around him; which isn't what anyone would expect.  There were a couple of scenes in the movie that went on and on and on, but weren't anything about Beauty or the Beast.  If a poll had been taken of everyone coming out of the screening of the movie, think everyone would agree that the movie didn't need changes, just simply another 20 minutes of real quality time and budding love between the two main characters.  I wonder if Emma's laid-back style of acting was somehow affecting what the producers did.",0,0,William Brown,e3Nl_TCQXuw,0.16649659863945582,2017-03-25 03:48:15,False,True

2017-03-25T15:19:07,"This movie was a masterpiece. It brought one of my favorite fairy tales to life. Emma fit the part both appearance and personality wise, even her singing was good (credit to Paige O'Hara for training her 🤗). The whole cast was fantastic but I really liked Gaston, Beast, and Mrs. Pott's performances. It really bugs me to see so many comments saying ""did I just see the whole movie?"" and ""it's all CGI blehhh."" 1, this is a live action REMAKE of the original film, which is very popular therefore most people who have or are going to see this have probably seen the original film. This means you ALREADY KNOW THE STORY, so why do you care so much if it was a little too revealing in the trailer? Even if you haven't, don't think of this as spoilers, but as a tribute. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite Disney movies ever, and this adaptation really did it justice. If you haven't seen the movie then you should know better than to click on the trailer because a LOT of trailers reveal too much these days (which for the record I hate too but with cases like these I'm okay with it because I already know the story.) 2, who cares??? Most movies use CGI these days. While I agree that sometimes they use it where it isn't necessary (*cough Jurassic World *cough) I think this movie had every right to use CGI. What did you think they were going to do? Find an actual talking candlestick and teach it to sing and dance? People like this need to stop being so hard to please because whether they use CGI or not you'll never be satisfied. When they do they're like, ""Ew it's CGI it looks so fake"" and when they don't they say it looks cheesy or find some other way to bash the film. Do you have any idea how hard the people who made this movie worked? I make movies myself and I can say that it takes me five to six MONTHS just to make a simple five minute stop motion let alone a 2 hour adaptation of a classic that could never be replaced. The pressure to make this rememberable was probably very high, and not just for the editors. The actors must have felt pretty pressured, too, to deliver a good performance, especially Emma since her most recognizable role is Hermione. She and everyone else did their best to make this the best live action remake, so for those people who like to criticize Disney and everyone in the movie business these days, how about you pull that stick out of your butt and leave the comment section?

A movie she was dying to see and of course i took care of her and we went to see it. She broke up with me on May 14th. You know when you love somebody so much that when they leave you for whatever reason, you feel like your hearts been ripped out (literally a hole in your chest), thrown onto the ground and stepped on? Yeah, regardless of the fact that we'd only been dating for 4 months. We had absolutely become glued to each other. Now she's gone from my life for the time being. Watching this literally hurts inside, in fact i still have the movie tickets from when we went. She thought we should break up because she had just been accepted to an accelerated nursing program at a university and after a week she realized her unbearable work load was too much and she works and baby sits part time. So she said she would have no time for a relationship (me). While i am happy she got into the program and she is pursuing her dream. I never thought nor wanted it to result in the end of our relationship. I've actually implemented the usual no contact rule of course. I'm waiting for her to miss me and text me to see how i am doing, if not then it's her loss. Basically i will never be able to buy this movie because i will be reopening this deep wound that i am trying to heal. It's a shame too, she and i really enjoyed it too.

First on my part, what happened casting directors?! why Emma Watson whom through the whole movie all you can hear is her British accent when Belle is Clearly french. There is no doubt that Emma is beautiful but she is not a Belle. Her style of acting is too serious and she pretty much frowns throughout the whole movie. Gaston is too old, and he is meant to look like an overbearing hunk of a fella that is totally into himself but ""who's name I can't remember"" doesn't exactly fit the description either. I would like to go through each and every character of importance because it really bugs me how a movie so beautiful had gone so wrong. it's like reading a great book and then only to be disappointed in watching the movie because they're just so different. if you're planning on doing a movie scene by scene exactly how it was in the original animation then please you must also do it word for word other wise I was left expecting something that never happened. It never made sense the whole feel of the movie was out of whack there were no deep sensations going on at all, I felt like too much effort had gone into a film that could have just flowed and it turned out a bit over the top. Does anyone understand what I am trying to say??? What I think in my head I'm not able to put into words the build up of frustration I have over this film.

2017-06-26T15:56:31,"Film fans will happily accept completely artificial animation like the beautiful drawings from the cartoon features Disney that were made when the master was still alive. And, of course, nobody blinks an eye at films photographed with real humans in convincing settings. But mix the two together and you have a problem. It's called the ""Uncanny Valley"" and the new Beauty and the Beast falls right into that classic sinkhole.  The problem of the ""Uncanny Valley "" became famous among animated films when Polar Express was released. A hyper-realistic Tom Hanks starred as the train conductor, his movements and even his facial expressions reproduced as computer animation through motion capture. It was the nadir of the ""Uncanny Valley"". Between artistic renderings and the filming of real actors, computer animated film visuals become ""creepy"" and even ""repulsive"" as they become more and more realistic. It's a bit like watching a greeting from a robot with a perfectly rendered plastic human face...fascinating but oddly scary. That's what happened with the supposedly reassuring depiction of Tom Hanks as the train conductor in Polar Express. The computerized animation was too realistic, yet false and so fell into that uncomfortable valley between artwork and photography. Beauty and the Beast tumbles deep into the Uncanny Valley by inserting real-life faces, mostly of Emma Watson, into entirely animatronic settings, impossible costumes and among jarringly artificial characters' faces.  Once again, this ""heartwarming"" animated remake fails to transport the audience anywhere but the dreaded valley where reality and artifice collide.  Perhaps kids who aren't jaded by an excess of film technology will be carried away, but there's no masking the weirdness of the newest $150 million Disney cartoon/reality creation.",0,0,George Wolff,e3Nl_TCQXuw,0.07974444909928781,2017-06-26 15:56:31,False,False

2018-05-06T14:35:05,One thing that I do want to say that I think a lot of people forget is that the 2017 version isn’t suppose to be exactly like the animated version of beauty and beast 1991 film but be inspired by it. Just like how the 1991 one was inspired by the original book. Cause my gosh some of the horrifying things that would have happened if they were to exactly follow it. 😰 And you can much easier create more beauty in an animated film than a live-action; even with all our editing programs and such for movies like this...so of course the animated version does have its own special beauty to it...that I don’t think can be topped.,0,0,Sierra Kristen,e3Nl_TCQXuw,0.18134920634920634,2018-05-06 14:35:05,False,False

Of course its easier to draw anything you want than to portray in real life, that's why you see more emotion here. Emma was mostly all alone talking to green screens or boring robots during filming (cgi was really OVER USED in be our guest), if they at least made Dan wear a real Beast costume, maybe just for ballroom scene, it would be more real and filled with romance like this one.

Maybe a Belle in a modern setting, similar to Vanesa Hudgens in Beastly, for this one they should really look for another actress. Designers did great job, but also failed - Belle didn't wear fallen shoulders dress, neither her iconic gloves - the ballroom scene also lacks emotion, they could make Dan wear the Beast costume just for that scene. Beast actually does look great, they based him on his looks of the original tale, where he has that appearance - an elegant goat (not a powerful bull-lion-werewolf like in animated).

As it looks like they've (for what I can see in this trailer) taken the classic Disney Animated version & updated it with today's state of the art CGI graphics/large sets/great costumes & actors who look like they wanted to do this fable justice via their acting capabilities...  I've seen many versions of Beauty & The Beast from Disney's Animated Musical Classic to versions that didn't use the name but were definitely taking direct cues from the subject matter of this films...  It looks as if they've created the animated version into a CGI film along with a cast of actors & added the songs also, though I'm not sure if the theme song was just used for the trailer & if there are all the songs from the animated version...  I actually remember the enjoyable late 80's Tv series of Beauty & The Beast which was set in moden times with Linda Hamilton of Terminator/Terminator 2  & the New Rebooted Version of Terminator out soon who played Catherine Chandler... Along with versatile character actor Ron Perlman playing Vincent & this was long before the many movies he has been before this Tv Series & long after...  And of course the film that made him a worldwide name which was Guillermo Del Toro's beautiful looking take on Hellboy & Hellboy 2 The Golden Army...  I found the updated Tv Series version set in a modern environment to be handled with taste & storylines that earned it much praise & awards...
