Caesar continues to show mercy, and a clip of both races fighting together and that little girl seemingly under their protection may show that it isn't an all-out war. I'll be glad if that's the case. I'm sure some apes would want all mankind wiped out as well, and the maneuvering in politics by both surviving races would be much more entertaining to me. But that's just me. This trailer gives nothing away besides bits to get excited about and to speculate on. I cannot wait for this movie.

The film was very emotional and the message was very strong in the film.   The story was quite good and it was was easy to follow through the end.   Cool movie with all these effects and to see from the monkeys perspective, I now feel more love towards monkeys.      Cons: Some scenes were so boring because they didn't do anything  (only cry for like an whole minute or just stare at each other and say some words)  Some moves in the film were so silly and I can't quite understand why the directors actually wanted this in the movie.   There weren't many gun fights and ""war things"" like I expected it to be it was more like the monkeys were held in hostage and had to work for their lives.
