Should Officer Dennis Booker perform a cameo in this film?  And if I remember correctly Judy Hoffs got promoted to one of the lead Detectives in their last final seasons so, she wasn't *Officer Judy Hoffs*. Should they cast a few of other actors to have co-stars roles in the sequel? For instance, a Harry Ioki, Anthony ""Mac"" McCann, Joey Penhall and etc.?
