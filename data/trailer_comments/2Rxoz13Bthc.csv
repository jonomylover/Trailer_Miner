Those of you who talk about a cliche scenario must probably be the ones who don't get that cinema films don't always need heavy drama, incredibly complex too deep scenarios, social and world commentaries off our real world or too edgy, depressing themes. If the actors and the narrative in combination with the music and the cgi are given in balanced numbers then any action flick can be a really good film for the audience.   This is gonna be an epic fantasy story about the Horde and the Alliance fighting and getting over it, probably both losing with Survival and Racism being the main concept.

2015-11-06T20:01:52,"I've been playing Blizzard games since I was a child starting with WC2.  I started WoW in middle school and am still playing out of undergrad.  Blizzard games connected me with my best friends even after I moved across the US.  I attribute Blizzard to still having a good relationship with my childhood friend today because we kept in contact and had a way to still connect.  My best friend died just before WOTLK and clocked in 127 days game time.  I transferred his character to my acct so in a way a part of him keeps on, particularly since WoW was something we all obsessed over.  We heard talk of a warcraft movie back then and I'm so happy that it's finally coming out now.  I don't care if the lore isn't exact or consistent necessarily, Warcraft is like a legend, it's ok to change some of the details.  I think the trailer looked amazing (I think some gamers have a stick up their ass and can never be happy with anything as well), I've already watched it three times and will certainly see it in theaters many times more and hope for success and a continuation of the rest of the Warcraft legends.  bless you Blizzard, Lok tar O'gar",0,0,Richard Hall,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.2991718426501035,2015-11-06 20:01:52,True,True

We've seen from Weta's previous work that they are great with more practical effects, costumes and make up so the choice to rely heavily on it is slightly disappointing. A slightly bothering problem though is the casting, they have gone with regular American actors with smooth voices when something like this should have people with more distinct appearances and voices, I feel more something more Northern would work better.

The cgi is also really uncomfortable, and the humans almost feel like they're popping out of the environment, like they're in front of a green screen the entire time.  The scope of the story also feels really limited.  They should be making a 4 hour epic with a sprawling cast, obviously fans of this franchise aren't going to mind sitting through a long-ass movie.

However, the amount of CGI and special effects in this trailer deeply disturbs me. Now, I know I'm no director or movie animator, but I am a viewer. And ultimately, it's the _viewers'_ opinion that makes or a breaks a movie and the possibility for sequels. A prime example of this is the Last Airbender. A combination of horrid animation, stiffness, and bad acting made for a complete flop that everyone makes fun of.

Maybe im being cynical but this trailer really lets me down in terms of the quality and polish I would expect from a usual Warcraft cinematic.

I think the conflict between war and unity of orcs and humans against each other or together against the burning legion(gul'dan) allows a further development in the next movies.   Sadly most of the people who played the game can't even name one character showed in this trailer because they dont give a shit about the lore of warcraft.

But they went above and beyond a generic Orcs vs Humans story and directly ripped off storyline names character locations from the Warhammer universe.

2015-11-07T04:48:01,"To be honest it just looks not good (enough). The CGI is just slightly better than the cinematics of Blizzard Entertainment. The backgrounds look cheap, the armors are ridiculous. The mixture of real people with animated orcs (obviously) is terrible in this case. And I predict that the story will be as good as the CGI else the trailer was set up differently. It is an attempt to translate Warcraft into a movie with real people. We actually see Legendary Pictures having (semi) interest in making a decent movie. It could have been worse. But it is not sadisfying. Im judging by what I see plus my knowledge of how trailers, teasers and movies work. My conclusion: It's an attempt. Noone was interested in making a good movie based on a game franchise so far. There are hopes for future films. Was it animated like all the cinematics from Blizzard, well then this case would have been a different story.

Period. Green orcs are the trademark of Warcraft for me, when I think ""Warcraft"" I think a big green monster in barbarian armor with an axe. (granted, this image was stolen from Warhammer... but at least own up to it!) This way they just look like buff tan humans with fangs. Next. The story is very generic. There wasn't a single phrase spoken in the trailer that made me feel hooked or want to know what's gonna happen. ""Let go of the racial hate and [optionally] unite against a common foe"" yadda yadda a.k.a. one of the oldests cliches in the book. Third. Too much CG. Now I'm usually a proponent of CG in every argument, but even to me this looks fake. Did they even use real-life locations to film this? Why couldn't they use prosthetics/make up to make the close-up orcs? LotR did it 15 years ago, FFS!

I'll still end up watching it, if only to be sure it's as bland as it looks like it will be, and hey, maybe if I just try to look past the waste of amazing source material it'll seem like an alright movie. I'd almost be interested in a saga of warcraft movies, but I doubt they'd be able to really capture the same feeling as the games.

2015-11-07T08:35:30,"I am wondering if any one else out there is feeling like they DRASTICALLY altered the lore for this movie. It looks like it will be good and I will go see it, but from this first trailer, it really is looking like it they just took characters and locations from the Warcraft universe and just made up their own story for the movie.  From the trailer, it appears as if the Orcs and Humans have yet to meet. Which would put this movie during the first game or the ""First War"". But there appeared to be a floating Dalaran at 1:20, which would put the timeline around Wrath of the Lich King. And to my knowledge, please correct me if I am wrong, but I do not remember any Orcs of any kind cooperating with the Humans (minus Gorona and her story). Also, I know for a fact that none of the Orcs that came through during the first invasion (Warcraft 1-2) were still brown. We didn't see any brown Orcs until Burning Crusade. I also think the logo on the banners the Orcs are using did not exist until the Third War, but feel free to correct me on that one as I am not 100% sure on it.  Plenty of other things I could probably nit-pick if I wanted to, but I won't. I will go see it and am excited for it, and we really can't say anything about the story until AFTER we see the full movie, but I am really hoping it sticks close to the current timeline or is an entirely different timeline and isn't supposed to be 100% based off the one we already know.

First off, that's fucking retarded and people should feel bad for even typing it. The mixture of CG and live action is what i have a problem with. You can make realistic looking orcs without CG, just look at Lord of the Rings. ""BUT THOSE DON'T HAVE THE WARCRAFT STYLE!!!"" You're right.

I got really excited since the filming of the movie actually began, I watched every piece of footage that was released/leaked and I was really looking forward to seeing this movie...until yesterday. I mean, wtf? They have great books on which they were supposed to build the story, but no, instead we are getting some weird orc-human alliance. What about Garona killing Llane? In the trailer it seems like she just thought to herself: ""Fuck you Medivh, Ragnar Lothbrok is more sexy than you, I feel the sudden need to make him forge an alliance with Durotan."" And the scene with little Thrall, I only hope that the river won't take him straight to Kalimdor, because as far as I am concerned Draka and Durotan should be dead by the time such scene could even happen. I really don't understand the need of movie producers to change major aspects of a well written story when it comes to terms of the movie. Not to mention that every major orc in the trailer is brown instead of green and they all look too human from tusks up and they have face expressions like their muscles are paralysed. I really hope that this bad impression I got from this trailer won't continue into the movie. But I personally think that people who would have appreciated this movie the most are those familiar with the books/games. I understand the need to make it appealing also to those who have no idea what warcraft is, but twisting the story into some stupid cliché is not the way.",0,0,Blaid3,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.029545454545454552,2015-11-07 12:27:29,True,True

Having the story of the first war on screen would be fairly uncoventional as there are a lot of complex elements with the many different assassinations of certain characters.

Not scoring on that, but instead introducing real actors in some Who Framed Roger Rabbit theme, is possibly the biggest disappointment for me here.

And that's a shame because warcraft is a great franchise and totally worth a cinematic retelling of its story. And also, our reactions are mixed because of the blend of cgi and human actors, and because of the character designs. Everything looks too surreal to comprehend at once. I personally hope this movie is going to be great and i found the trailer fine and with some captivating visuals. It could have been better if it avoided the cliched dialogue it's characters speak throughout. Also the fact that it has tv stars( not to increase budget obviously) and not at least a couple of big name actors in it is another kind of trouble.

2015-11-07T16:03:18,"A few points that I feel need to be added for all haters out there: 1. The movie isn't about World of Warcraft, it's plot is derived from the original Warcraft 1 2. The story has been around for over 20 years, the lore of the Warcraft universe is enormous 3. There aren't any undead, gnomes, night elves, pandaren, etc... because at that point in time they haven't been introduced in the story, so stop asking for them, it's illogical 4. Green screens had to be used for the settings, this isn't an enormous budget blockbuster so don't expect it to look like a full HD LotR. They wanted to give it a game-ish vibe with the tone and style and I think they did a great job at that 5. They used a combination of live action and CGI for the orcs 6. Both the humans and orcs look not only faithful to the source material but amazingly realistic and any other comment on that is pure ranting 7. Regarding all the comments about it not being ""a huge budget blockbuster"" and ""Jurassic Park, Star Wars: Phantom Menace and Lord of the Rings: Return of the Kings not being blockbusters in that case because they were made with less money"" you need to take into account the fact that money changes it's value rather quickly. 100 million in the time LotR was made would equivalate to over 200 million in today's economy, the Hobbit movies (lesser versions of the original trilogies) being proof of this.   Seriously, I don't get all the non-WoW players ranting on this trailer. What did you expect? An Oscar worthy period piece about a veteran dealing with racism and alcoholism shot in lazy pan cams and close ups of characters staring out of a window in slow motion? It's a fantasy....gosh.

2015-11-07T16:22:50,"Here's an analytical approach to why I can instinctually tell this is a terrible movie:  • This story is based on the human-orc conflicts from the earliest, least-developed, least interesting parts of the Warcraft franchise. Where are the more exotic creatures? • Movie audiences have been fatigued of high-fantasy epic war movies long since all the movies that tried to be the next _Lord of the Rings_. This movie is 15 years late and even so feels extremely watered-down compared to things like LOTR. • Dialogue and plot premise is *excruciatingly cliché*. No one will be invested in such a routine, formulaic story that they've seen a million times before. • Blizzard games have never really been character-driven stories. I guarrantee no one will relate to or care about these characters and by extension won't care about the story altogether. • Shayamalan's Avatar the Last *Airbender-calibre actors*. • Wolves, griffins, tusk-bearing, pointy-eared orcs, et cetera give this a cringey furry vibe. • Videogamey / cartoony physics are so unrealistic that the audience can't predict how a fight will turn out. For example, tiny human knights realistically have no chance against an Incredible Hulk-like orc. The outcomes of fights are at the arbitration of the writers, so there's *no tension*, which is crucial to action movies. Since fights themselves won't advance the story, the audience will be bored waiting for them to end. • This film has a weak prospective audience, likely insufficient to turn a profit. It's best bet seems to be 10 year old boys who don't recognize or care about a movie being garbage, along with the parents who bring them. Video game nostalgia won't be enough to draw a decent audience to the theatres because it's very franchise-specific, as opposed to something like _Wreck-it-Ralph_ which celebrates videogames in general. _Wreck-it-Ralph_ is also, crucially, _actually_ a good movie.  I have doubts that this movie will turn a profit.

So if you expect it to be fixed by June 10th there is a little chance - (the problem lies mostly in the ""lighting"" from what i saw - the material shaders for the CGI) To fix this they need to go back to CG render.. tweak the settings/change the lights re-render - and after that, it needs to go to compositing department- tweak here and there to match the new comp.. (for each shot) - and CG rendering is allot time consuming.. speaking hours of render time per frame (on ordinary PC)..  I think even if they wanted they wouldn't have the time to do it..  Though.. the CGI is not that bad - i think it will work well in this movie as it is. We will see.",0,2,Kire Timov,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.038762626262626276,2015-11-07 16:41:01,True,True

The story of this movie seems to take place somewhat before the events of Warcraft 1, and during Warcraft 1. With that being said what ""story"" are you expecting from a movie trying to replicate a game from 20+ years ago, which had a storyline and lore of ""Orc green. Orc sack human capital. Human defend. Human good. Orc bad."".  Considering the source material being as bare bones as it gets, I'm surprised that this movie actually looks as complicated as it is.

With Christopher Metzen working on it I have a feeling it will still be a great movie since Chris was the one working on a lot of the storyline for the games in the first place...  On the flip side, I feel that the movie is trying to focus a lot on the action and what they think people want to see. The storyline is amazing, it does not need anything extra to appeal to the audience. To me, the story of warcraft surpasses LOTR by far, but if they make it too heavily focused on the fighting and combat (like half of this trailer shows) then I don't believe it will be a great movie.   My summary: If the movie follows the storyline like it should, then it should be a great movie. If the whole movie is just like this trailer, then it will flop.   Also, Warcraft 2 and 3 get even better (the timeline and the games). If this movie doesn't suck but doesn't really do great either, I hope they will continue and make a sequel.

2015-11-07T19:43:56,"I look forward to seeing this movie! This trailer just pumped me up to see this <3  One thing only bugs me is this: you fans. It just bothers me to see you all complain about it. Look, I might not know much of this series, this world, and so forth... but looking up the backstory of the movie... it's about the BEGINNING of this whole thing, which is totally understandable. There could be more movies in the future that will bring it up to where it is at now for the games or whatnot.  Get over it. To me, you all are a little too hardcore for this series, the games, and etc. Just be grateful they're making a movie for it, even a movie SERIES if it comes to it. I, for one, am looking forward to seeing it. I love the trailer, I love the effects, I love everything. I just cannot wait to see it.  I am only a year in, mayber 2 (since this year was the only time I got really into it once I got the game to work again after the latest game pack. Since that game was released my graphics card had to be updated in order to play again, and I've been in 2 months in again after half a year last year playing it) and I love the series, the gameplay... haven't done dungeons and all that others stuff against and with other players... I just love playing the game, seeing different creatures and monsters and going through many of the lands. It's just absolutely amazing.   Don't get overly hardcore about this movie and what your ""expectations"" are, this movie is about the START of it all, the ORIGINS. All this stuff you want to see would possibly be shown in later movies. Once you think about it, it makes sense.  Have a nice day (I won't be replying back to anywho who comments this, cause I am not gonna bother making points, agreeing or arguing. I am just a simple loving world of warcraft gamer who simply loves the games and playing it for fun. I am not a hardcore person against or with other players online, I just play for fun).",0,0,SnowyReign,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.15664414414414413,2015-11-07 19:43:56,True,True

It looks like the non CGI characters are standing in front of a green screen.  2. CGI characters don't work on screen with real people. It looked bad in the Hobbit and it looks even worse in this trailer. 3. I think The LOTR Trilogy's Orks worked best because there were actual people in makeup. With Warcraft and The Hobbit its like watching a CGI game cut scene mixed with live action.   I'll pass on this movie but it's all subjective.

I guess I just expected a movie about a conflict more alike that between the Empire and the Stormcloaks in The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. Where the whole ordeal is in the grey area, instead of making it completely obvious who the bad guys are and who the good guys are.

But the point is, in the scene where Draka (female orc with the baby) is putting Go'el/Thrall (Baby Green Jesus) in the water, that isnt apart of the rise of the Horde book. What actually is supposed to happen is that Thrall is found under Draka and Durotan after being chased and killed. The humans find Thrall and take him back to the internment camps.

Now of course we only see things in the books from certain key character's perspectives during certain times, so perhaps what I've seen from the trailer is just the 'filling in' of the gaps.

2015-11-08T03:23:47,"Being an old school Warcraft player (which included playing the original Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, 1994 game on two floppy disks). I feel I should assist some of the younger players, and others, who started playing the World of Warcraft series from 2004 onwards, and may not be familiar with the earlier lore. This movie will be mainly based around the time frame of the original Orcs and Humans game (to the best of my knowledge). These events occurred 30 (in-game years) before the World of Warcraft story chapter began,  and deals with the first conflict between the race of men and Orcs, after the opening of the 'Dark Portal', which subsequently begins the 'First War'. The opening of the Dark Portal was orchestrated by Medivh, the Last Guardian, and Gul'dan and his shadow council. Gul'dan, as most of you probably know, had been influenced by the Demon Kil'jaeden, to consume his demonic blood, and in turn, corrupted the other orc clans, which imbued them with increased strength and rage. Gul'dan then installed a ""puppet"" Chieftain, Blackhand, to lead the newly formed 'Horde' through the portal into Azeroth. The warchief of the Frostwolf Clan, Durotan, convinced that Gul'dan would destroy their people, spoke out against Gul'dan. Because of Durotan's popularity, Gul'dan exiled Durotan and his clan, and they were one of the first clans to travel through the portal. Once the Horde entered Azeroth and initiated conflict with the kingdom of Stormwind, ruled by King Llane, so began the First War between Orcs and Humans. We need to keep in mind that the Orcs had only just entered the human world of Azeroth in this period, so they have yet to encounter the Ogres and Trolls (who are both native to Azeroth), and do not enslave the Dragon brood until the 'Second War', which is around 6 years later. Comparatively, on the human side, this conflict only contained the military forces of Stormwind, led by Lord Lothar, and as such, did not include any Dwarven, Gnomish or Elven forces as yet. The 'Alliance' was not formed until the Second War, which events are played out in Blizzard's Warcraft ll: The Tides of Darkness 1995 PC game. I will leave any further details out in case I inadvertently reveal any spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the Warcraft lore of this period.",1,0,Jazza12982,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.06372819100091827,2015-11-08 03:23:47,True,True

The cop then turns on the sirens to alert the people that the cop is going to find out what they are up to, but all of them except 1 ran away. The cop asked this one person ""why did those other people run away,"" then the person showed him a drug called crystal meth and so, the cop got the idea that those other people were either drug dealers, or that one of them was a drug dealer.

Thus Warcraft IS ""aping"" The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit; but so has every other high fantasy epic since 1937.   So rather than getting into a pissing contest bitching about source material or literary ancestors, lets all agree to see if this movie succeeds or fails on its own rights, because at this point there is no such thing as an ""original"" fantasy epic, period.

2015-11-09T14:32:13,"Spent a few years playing Warcraft and WoW myself back in the day. Looks pretty good, overall. I think the director and production company did the best they could while staying within the boudaries of the game's lore.   The issue I have is with the game itself. While most fantasy settings have a tendency to be racially biased (i.e. the ""good"" races - humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, etc. always being white), Blizzard took things a step further when they created Warcraft. They followed the familiar LOTR formula with the Alliance and it's races, but the designs for the races of the Horde were just racist and lazy. They basically just copy/pasted the real-life cultures of various people of color onto all the beast-races of the horde. Orcs=African, trolls=Hatian/Jamaican, tauren=Native Americans, goblins=black hip/hop culture mixed with Jewish stereotypes.   I get that this game is over a decade old and that it's neigh-impossible for Blizzard to gut the lore of the game at this point to reflex the diversity of today's society. It's just bothersome that the Warcraft universe has gotten so big with very few people taking the time over the years to raise issue with this design. Trying to remain neutral on the movie, but the trailer leaves me with little hope. Seems there were very few people of color casted in this movie (I'm looking at extras and side-characters mostly because I know that sticking to lore means that most of the Alliance main characters will be white).   I must say though, that I know Legendary and Duncan Jones knew what they were dealing with getting in to this. I think it was a good move to have the orc characters played by white actors. Would be a major insult to have the only actors of color be made to only play the beast races. It's bad enough that the only black actor I've heard of in the movie (Paula Patton) was cast as Garona (a half orc).",0,0,Daniel Dew,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.06739837398373985,2015-11-09 14:32:13,True,True

Judging by the Orcs' motivation of a 'dying world,' this is entirely based on the story of WC1. There, the Orcs were not under the influence of demonic corruption. In fact, they had been led by Gul'dan and the Warlocks for quite some time and had only stumbled upon Azeroth by accident. So, if this movie uses that story as the dialogue indicates, there is no Burning Legion. The whole concept of a demonic army wasn't written in until WC2, when the storyline of the Orcs was entirely retconned.  So no Burning Legion = No Scourge = No Ner'zhul = No Lich King.

Also, the sexual dimorphism for orcs in this trailer is worse than in the actual game... that'd be impressive if it wasn't so sad.",0,0,ccggenius12,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.07460317460317459,2015-11-11 09:50:29,True,True

The music sounds like it wants to lead you on more into the tale and that's why you get rise and fall sounds in all of the scenes.  Remember folks, this is the first story of Warcraft. They are taking it slow and not rushing the lore. They want to introduce the Orcs and Humans to everyone especially those who never played the game. Base building is where it's at to set the foundation for future Warcraft movies. 2 hours of movie isn't anywhere close to introduce all the characters from the entire game series let alone tell the lore.

I'm a Destiny player now and do not play WoW anymore, but that game has a very soft spot in my heart. Those who play the game will understand what I mean. I had so many good memories, so many friends that I still see and a wonderful community to experience a brave new world. WoW was meant to be a cyber world, but it went way beyond that. I just hope that this movie will help people to understand why this lore and story is incredible. Man, I got very emotional, but this is just the way WoW makes me feel.

2015-11-20T07:28:11,For Blizzard's sake let's hope this pays off.  This doesn't actually look half bad. But to pull off a true Wow feature. Would have required more time and money.   Then any studio would likely want to commit.  Personally i would have prefered Starcraft.  As would have been easier to adapt to film but i digress.    Personally Pixar would have seemed to have been a better fit. But maybe this would have been a bit to dark for them to take the risk. Well i guess we will have to see what happens. :/,0,2,BlazinNSoul,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.044871794871794886,2015-11-20 07:28:11,True,True

And I know nothing about Warcraft, and I don't give two shits about whether this movie is good or bad. I wanted to start up a rise, and see to what lengths a dumb little fanbase will go to protect their dumb little hobbies in their own minds. Turns out, if even the slightest criticism arises, it will be buried under brilliant counterpoints such as ""Yes you are spoiled"" (Because you say so, right?) and undeniably genius logical quandaries such as ""It's not cliched if it follows the same plot as the game, right?"" (Very wrong. Any competent writer will tell you the same.)  You're all participating in the same type of mob mentality that rules religious cults, and will go to any lengths to make sure that your perception of reality remains intact.

2015-12-10T01:02:18,Possible spoiler alert: This is just my opinion from this trailer. It looks like there are two factions of Orcs. We got the original Orcs who are tanned skinned and we got the green skin Orcs who have been corrupted by demon blood. Perhaps in their original home world of Draenor the two factions are at war and their planet is being destroyed possibly because of magic and demonic energy. The portal to Azeroth has been created and both sides are going through it. The green skins want to conquer Azeroth while the Orcs want to create a new home for their people and escape the legion army of green skins. I think the Orcs will ally with the Humans to fight the green skins who threaten them both.,0,0,Rick Rouse,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.05863636363636364,2015-12-10 01:02:18,True,True

Keep in mind, this is NOT based directly on Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. Were that the case, we'd see lots of town building and small fighting over the towns. This is moreso based on the lore BOOKS involved with the Warcraft franchise. Book-to-movie adaptations tend to be executed a lot better, especially by the likes of Legendary Pictures. I have strong faith that the movie will at least be good, if not great. Just from what was shown in the teaser and trailer, I know Rise of the Horde and The Last Guardian should be involved, probably up to the very beginning of Tides of Darkness.

As I know Dalaran was floated to Northrend many years later when the cursade started against Icecrown. This movie takes place even before the Scourge broke the magical barrier defending the city and killing Archmage Antonidas, and at that time Dalaran was admittedly on the ground.

Lets cross our fingers they didn't screw it up. Why didnt they dub the cheap actors voices with unique voices like Chris Metzen, Carlos Larkin, Jamieson Price, Patrick Seitz and P.J. Mattson.

Warlords of Draenor sucked unless you liked your Henchmann's Garrison as your personal castle, Ashran sucked! WoW PvP has been a lackluster joke since the end of Cataclysm, I spent most of the Pandaria and Draenor eras trolling, mocking, and 'role playing' my rogue characters, and it eventually got me banned.

And the man with white hair is Morres, the butler of Medivh, cuz at this point of time, Medivh might not be that old, which I believe that this is happened few years after Medivh woke up from coma. And the storm wind city 0:19 is the most original city that was very different from the one in the WOW, (that white building is Cathedral of Light). I think is because the limitation of game server and low wage paid to VanCleef and his crew, so that the one in the game can not rebuilt after Orcs destroyed it. After the storm wind city had been destroyed, Varian was sent to Lordaeron and raised up with Arthas.

2016-05-25T12:38:12,"I just watched it and this is my personal rating, The movie is a fucking 5/5!!  disclaimer: I'm a bit biased because I'm a fan of the Warcraft games in general especially the RTS. Warcraft 1 was one of my first RTS that I played along with C&C and that's way back in 1995. Anyway I'll just list the it's pros and cons of the movie.  Pros: + They nailed the look of the movie, especially the ORCs. It just looks and feels like Warcraft. The armors, weapons, props looked really good as well. + CGI is amazing, definitely one of the best by ILM. The facial expressions of the Orcs are just awesome to look at, it might rival Avatar in that department. +  The game locations, stormwind, dalaran. Seeing it in the big screen is a joy to us Warcraft fans. (Although some locations are not accurate like Dalaran is not supposed to float not until Archimonde sieged it during the events of WC3) + Dialogue is good enough, dont expect some LotR narrative. + Lothar is just awesome, hopefully we will see more of Travis Fimmel in the big screen.Overall most of the actors did well even the CGI orcs Durotan, Ogrim,  Guldan etc. + It's action packed no dull moments for me. + Magics are represented well in this movie, theres incantations and  magic circle.  If you are a mage in World of Warcraft you prolly had  orgasmed after seeing it lol. + There are some shots later on when the cameras are overhead and it looked like a warcraft RTS game. + This movie gave me feels than that specific BvS scene.   Cons - Some plotpoints might be confusing because the movie is just only 2HRs, the movie pacing is quite fast. - Not adding some familiar game music is a missed opportunity.  - Dwarves are CGI - Battles are quite short I expected more. Also needs better battle choreography, the footmen lacks battle formations. The human armies lacks variety in soldiers or classes. No archers, no clerics etc. lol  I think the movie will hold itself well to those who are not familiar with the source material. I just hope that the movie will just fine in the box office, it needs its returns for future sequel/s. The Warcraft lore is just vast and it will be a shame if this first movie will be the last. Just go ahead have an open mind and watch it, Ignore the critics. Your opinion is what matter most. The movie entertained me than most recent superhero movie releases. Hopefully the Assassins creed movie will do great, we need more good videogame movies.",4,1,Devilrose,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.21782407407407406,2016-05-25 12:38:12,True,True

2016-06-15T03:12:51,"Let's all give the critics a round of applause for unfairly lambasting a franchise to death so they can make a name for themselves. I kept hearing the same ""plot is too convoluted and ridiculous"" argument, so I went into the theater expecting something truly messy and incoherent. While some aspects require a bit of thinking to follow (oh no!!!), I can confidently say the amount of criticism was completely unwarranted.  There have been far, far more convoluted movies that still acquired critical approval, so to see Warcraft get panned for being concise is a fucking joke. The whole plot is pretty clear if you're paying attention. You have to infer a few  things, and the names will require a little effort to remember, but overall it's really not asking that much of viewers so long as you're willing to accept that some minor details will require more installments to fully reconcile (a concept that apparently is only egregious when done by a game based movie). The pacing is reasonably fast, which is perfect for properly fleshing out such a rich world, and is not hard to follow if you aren't expecting the movie to spoon feed every plot point.  I also admire Jones' boldness in embracing the darker aspects of the Warcraft universe. There are several scenes that are genuinely moving and emotionally/visually powerful, scenes that most directors these days are too timid to execute properly. Warcraft has some flaws,  such as a few lackluster line deliveries and some abrupt location transitions near the beginning to name a few, but nothing that comes remotely close to sabotaging the entire spectacle. I also would have liked to see a bit more gore, but I can understand the need to avoid the R rating with such a heavy investment (the violence is still very satisfying, however). If you're an action/fantasy lover and you're deciding whether or not to go see it, please do. The story is engaging and the visuals and action offer more than enough to fully back it up.  If you are somehow disappointed, at least ensure you made a conscious effort to actually absorb the information on screen before you criticize my recommendation.",86,10,alternate241,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.061406249999999996,2016-06-15 03:12:51,False,True

2016-06-15T12:08:58,"It's much, much better than I expected.  That said, it's a movie for people who are at least somewhat familiar with WarCraft lore.  I myself started playing from WC3 but it wasn't hard for me to recognize all the locations from my WoW years (Started playing during the last months of vanilla, and I stopped after WoTLK).  There's some small discrepancies in the story, and some locations, like Dalaran floating in the air already, but those didn't bother me.  Overall the movie is great.  The only ones I've heard complain about it is people who don't know absolutely anything about the franchise, and expected a much more simplified plot.  Like, for example, to them Khadgar is just some fumbling unimportant side character.  When they see StormWind they go ""That's some castle I don't care about LOL"", or they giggle like idiots at the glowing eyes and say ""pff, whats with the glowing eyes? that shit's wack yo!"".  I can't be too harsh though, they don't know the lore, so they can't possibly appreciate moments like when King Llane stopped to talk to kid Varian, because they don't know, don't care who he might be some day, or to care about ""who that green kid floating down the river is, or why the movie is wasting so much time on him"".  I also can't expect them to appreciate that nostalgic trip to Karazhan, because they never raided that place on weekends with old friends.  To them it's wasted time instead of getting to the ""cool combat scenes for which they paid a movie ticket to go see!"".

2016-07-11T01:50:52,"Agreed! Here is something to consider in all this. Warcraft collectively now is the highest grossing game to movie film ever. It will likely cross 450 million soon. Which neither Independence Day 2 which was clearly a bomb. Nor X-Men apocalypse have done yet. Sad considering the install base of these films.   Now while it can be argued it is done very poorly domestically. That is really not that important anymore. Outside of Marvel, Disney & Pixar there isn't much domestically worth talking about. Which has broken over 250 million domestically. The fact Warcraft is pushing 500 million. Even with International sales is impressive.   Considering the box office bombs of the last couple of months. So the chances of a sequel are possible. Altough maybe not on as wide a release. Warcraft market seems better positioned outside US then in. So we may get a sequel but have to wait a bit longer. But really no complaints as it was quit good. Considering how bad it could have been I can't complain really. :)",1,0,BlazinNSoul,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.011199999999999998,2016-07-11 01:50:52,False,True

Proud to be gamer! haha.  Its not as bad as what other people say but I feel like Im in two worlds that got me confused.  Its like watching LOTR and Anduin Lothar is played by Ryan Reynolds. The comedic side of it didnt really fit in to the movie.  As an epic game and pretty much the creme de la creme of its genre I was hoping they would go for the serious route.  Especially if it involves Draka taking a bite off of another orc, humans head being squished and all of its glorious goriness.  Next would be Ben Schnetzer playing Khadgar.  I felt that he didnt have a strong presence in the movie. Probably because they made his character nerdy and as if almost helpless but hey he saved the Azeroth!  He reminds me of Podrick Payne, the squire from Game of Thrones.  Lastly and I promise this is the last ""con"" review, its the unecessary CGIs like the glowing eyes of the night elves, pretty much over the top yet irrelevant. I must say theres a lot of glowy glowy eyes in this movie. Other than that, Gul'dan is really epic and Medivh is played very well by Archangel aka Ben Foster, 2 Bens!.  Especially the part when he is halfway looking like Sargeras.  That gave me the chills!  So all in all I give it 3 stars. Was it a good movie?  Absolutely!  Would I watch it again?

The movie switched studios like at least twice during it's development - there were disagreements. For the most part, the story is true to the original one, probably more so than any other movie based on a game/book, but was shortened way too much because, I guess, the developers didn't think people would want the movie to be too long. So they ended up cutting out too much, and the movie ended up being something that fans of WoW /Warcraft could easily follow due to prior knowledge, but people who do not know anything about the lore struggled to make sense of the movie. Think of some of the great books with rich lore made into movies: Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. First Harry Potter was a 2.5 hour long movie, first Lord of the rings was 3.5ish hour movie as well. This movie? Less than 2 hours. Of course people couldn't follow it, you cut out the damn story! I'm so mad. I loved this movie, but I have a bias as I am a huge fan, but because they messed it up, there likely won't be a sequel.  Critics are the worst people.

2018-12-08T03:00:10,"I went into this film without expectation whatsoever.  I'm of the minority of viewers without any real Warcraft experience -- having never played any previous Warcraft title and only ever playing a very miniscule amount of World of Warcraft -- so naturally I watched this film adaptation as if it were just a standalone piece of media.  Afterwards I had heard that critics tore this film apart with negative reviews, the general consensus being that Warcraft underperformed and failed to meet expectations.  This sentiment is one that I find myself unable to relate to.  Personally I found the film to be entertaining at the bare minimum.  If I had to air a complaint, I would say that the dialogue frequently left something to be desired.  That the writers made it harder to remember character names and roles than I'd have wished.  That the factions seemed to act without a foundation of tangible reason.  Orcs, in my mind, shouldn't have been willing participants in their enslavement to demons, and humans shouldn't have been so helpless against the orc invasion.  I felt as though some characters were competent and, as a result, weren't ever in any real danger while the other characters were completely impotent and seemed like defenseless children rather than soldiers.  But the main cast was lovely.  I found myself rooting for each protagonist, regardless of their allegiances, no matter how one-dimensional they seemed to be.  The world was beautiful, the sets were interesting, and the action sequences were impactful.  It might not be a front-runner for Oscar praise, and it might not be a film I could ever compare to classics, but Warcraft served its purpose in my opinion.  It was entertaining enough that I find myself looking at clips online, and I might watch it again.  To call it bad feels a bit harsh in my opinion, but my opinion is just that -- my opinion.  Here's to hoping the next installment is as good if not better.  Also, if they focus on a story surrounding just a few specific characters, Starcraft could also make for a great film adaptation.  Perhaps even better than Warcraft adaptations.",0,1,Gerald Wiseman,2Rxoz13Bthc,0.08175675675675677,2018-12-08 03:00:10,False,False

It annoys me how the critics have treated it, and its director. Finally there's a movie that has it all: faithful to the original story, a solid argument with interesting and wholesome characters, secondary stories that contribute to the film and don't feel empty, decent effects, and finally, a perfect ending (that leaves you wanting more).  I'm usually extremely harsh with movies, especially the recent cringy ones that seems are made for kids with stupid jokes all the time, empty characters, romances that don't make sense, etc. But this is not one of those. Maybe that's the reason the critics treated Warcraft the way they did. It didn't sell as well as the ""family friendly"" ones. The new ""conventional"". It makes me so upset that their incompetence is keeping me from watching the second, and third delivery of this story, when nowadays the cinema is nothing but remakes and shitty movies.   Hopefully we'll have Warcraft II some time in the future, I will pay my ticket to see it at the premiere, as it deserves. If you are reading this and haven't seen it yet, please DO.
