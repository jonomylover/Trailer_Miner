The film is scheduled to be released in China in December 2016 by Le Vision Pictures and China Film Group Corporation and in the United States on February 17, 2017 by Universal Pictures. The Great Wall will be Lau's first film role in a Hollywood production and his second collaboration with director Zhang.""  So a Chinese state run studio works with Hollywood and hires two of the biggest american actors to play some of the lead roles in a movie that is not even historically accurate and set in ancient China is whitewashing?

But this struck me on a personal level. Quite insulting in fact,  as I read director Zhang Yimou's excuse (doesn't sound like him talking  at all...considering how well he has done for China in directing the cultural celebration displays in Beijing Olympics) for casting Damon in a leading role, (despite the setting being a fantasy historical origin,  an age of which the setting had little to NO exposure to Western culture...we're talking some 3000-5000 into the past.): 'in order to get the western audience into seats, and to make the Chinese culture more  visible to the world, we had to cast Damon, who is a recognisable face.' Huh.  According to that...the only way my culture will be considered  'normal and worthy of investment' is if an A-class Hollywood actor plays the hero who saves everyone, above one of the greatest human architectural achievements of Chinese history, during a warring age  where some of the most disciplined and awesome warriors, martial arts  and combat tactics and weapons were developed (we practically invented the cannon and multi-shot crossbows a few thousands years earlier than  the ACTUAL cannon and single shot crossbows).  Let me tell you, my heroes were NOT Matt Damon, Robert Downy Jr, Ben Affleck or even Christopher Reeve. The heroes I saw on TV and the cinemas were little-known Chinese actors, some of whom were fortunate enough to fall into enough stereotypes to be considered bankable by Hollywood, like Jet Lee, and Jackie Chan. But so many others were left  in the dark, simply because they don't do Kung Fu. Hell, The Great Wall looks like a fucking Kung Fu movie, and they are not faithful enough to  AT LEAST cast a well-known Chinese action star for the lead role. You  know...Donnie Yen is a decent START. Tony Leung is getting old but he was GREAT in Red Cliff.  The trailer itself even looks to be a step down from the artistic statements that defined Yimou's films in early 2000s...the trailer is basically telling me that dumbing down individualistic creativity, cast  white actors, do explosions and Americans will gobble it up.

2016-08-14T17:19:58,"A few things: ""white"" minority ethnic groups most certainly did live in ancient and Imperial China. They're called the Tocharians, the Wusun, the Yuezhi, the Sogdians, and the Cumans, all of them Indo-Europeans with similar languages except for the Cumans, who spoke a Turkic language (many Cumans were also Asiatic instead of Caucasian). Then we have foreigners who came later: Persians (bringing Manichaeanism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam) and West Asian Semites (bringing Nestorian Christianity, Judaism, and Islam) arriving in the 7th century, Italian merchants and their families (bringing Catholocism) arriving in the 13th century, mostly from Genoa and Venice, Papal diplomats and missionaries from Rome, Portuguese, and Spaniards (bringing Catholocism) arriving in the 16th century as explorers, traders and conquerors, and finally Dutchmen and Englishmen (bringing Protestant creeds to the southern shores of China). White people living in China today include the Pamiri Tajiks, descendants of those ancient Sogdians who were so numerous in China during the Tang period, and the Macanese of Macau (the latter mostly being mixed race, though).  So now that we've established that there were native white people in historical Imperial China who considered it their home, let's bring up the fact that Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal are supposedly playing medieval Western European mercenaries. That's a far-fetched idea, since the only Europeans in Song and Yuan era China were merchants, missionaries, and diplomats as described above. Yet this is a fantasy movie about dragon slug monsters, so historical realism doesn't matter. This is a historical fantasy, not a standard historical drama, so having white Westerners in the cast is absolutely fine. It's also hardly whitewashing, since they aren't stealing Chinese roles. This is a film directed by Zhang Yimou and produced in China by Chinese production companies. Chinese moviegoing audiences welcome the presence of Western actors because in their view this promotes diversity in their own films, which are overbearingly Han Chinese. It would be nice if more of the 56 official ethnic monorities of China got more screen time, but this is just as good in my opinion.

2016-08-20T15:46:24,"Aside from his solid stardom appeal to a Western audience, I think you're missing the major plot point as to why Matt Damon is in this film. Nevermind the fact that white Indo-European ethnic minorities existed in ancient and Imperial China (the Tocharians, the Yuezhi, the Wusun, and most especially the Sogdians, their Pamiri Tajik descendants still living in Xinjiang, China to this day), how about the fact that THERE WERE MEDIEVAL EUROPEANS IN IMPERIAL CHINA. This film is set during the Northern Song period (960- 1127 AD). During the Southern Song (1127 - 1279 AD) and Yuan Dynasty, European merchants, mostly Italians from Venice and Genoa, began settling in Yangzhou with their entire families in tow. Papal diplomats and missionaries from Rome continuously made trips back and forth from Western Europe to the Mongol courts at Karakorum in Mongolia, and Dadu in China (modern-day Beijing). Forget Marco Polo, the most famous medieval European in China only because of his well-received book about the matter. William of Rubruck is the man you should focus on. A Flemish Franciscan monk, William arrived at the court of Mongke Khan (then the ruler of the northern half of China, his successor Kublai Khan would finish the conquest of southern China later on) in January of 1254 AD. He is the most likely candidate for learning the Chinese formula for gunpowder and bringing it to Europe, since his friend Roger Bacon, the English philosopher and scientist, was the first man in Europe to record the formula for gunpowder, in 1267 AD.   Matt Damon is essentially going to play the mercenary soldier version of William of Rubruck. William's life certainly wasn't boring and it would make a good movie, albeit not even as popular as Marco Polo on Netflix. Genrerally speaking, people are ignorant and stupid, especially the moviegoing public (sorry guys, it's true, look at all the super hero movies). Let's face it: the only way they could make a movie about this was by adding dragons in it and having Matt Damon bungee jump off the Great Wall while blowing things up with Chinese gunpowder rocket arrows. People would much rather see that then a real historical drama about the man who most likely spread gunpowder from China to Europe in the 13th century. If we pushed this back further in time, Damon could easily play the role of a ancient Roman, seeing how they led embassies to Eastern Han China from 166 AD onwards, or a Byzantine Greek, considering how their monks smuggled silkworms from the Northern Qi Empire of China back to the Eastern Roman Empire during the mid 6th century. Or they could have even set this movie during the much later Ming Dynasty, and had Damon play a Portugueseman, Spaniard, or Italian who arrived on the southern shores of China during the early 16th century. Hell, they could have even made him a Sogdian general like Li Baoyu during the Tang Dynasty, who became the Duke of Liang for his role in suppressing An Lushan's rebellion (wink, wink, yet another white Indo-European Sogdian general) and fighting the Tibetans in the mid 8th century AD.",1,0,Eric Connor,6SKI9rgqFck,0.07461309523809524,2016-08-20 15:46:24,True,True

If he was more of a supporting character we can probably play it off as necessary token for non Chinese audience to relate to and even make him the principle narrator of the story for us, non Chinese audience. However, his characterization seems to be overshadowing the plot, not a good sign.     I just hope there isn't force romance between the native female warrior protagonist and Matt Damon because the foreigner-native girl romance is an overused unnecessary trope that reduces female characterization given the genre, action oriented. Also, the trope is somewhat illogical considering the social historical context. Judging by the trailer, it doesn't seem like we need to be worrying about that yet.    An example would be watching a movie about Godzilla, but it constantly skips to the human characters even though the audience want to see Godzilla.
