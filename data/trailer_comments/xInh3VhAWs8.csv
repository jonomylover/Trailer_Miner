If this was meant to be such a serious tone, why hire the star, director, and writer with primarily comedic backgrounds. iono I still have faith, but this teaser didn't build hype for the movie, it looks like an early 2000's marvel movie, which isn't good at all. Either way, the person who edited this trailer, gave off the wrong tone and vibe, and made me not want to watch this movie.

My biggest issue is that this takes place in a post Avengers world, so it seems unfitting for this to be as prominent as the trailer makes it out to be.

Well, this teaser definitely gives off a more serious tone, but some people are still going to complain (by which I mean, the same people who probably complained about Guardians and ended up liking it). Like I said, everyone should have their own opinion. Besides, maybe it's because of the concept of an Ant-Man movie that makes people skeptical, I don't know.  Oh, and I like that little thumbs up thing Scott does as Ant-Man before he shrinks or whatever. It just gives off a light-hearted feel for the movie.

I know I am excited about it, Ant-Man isn't one of the biggest characters in terms of popularity, but he does play a major role in the Marvel universe, so it will be cool to see how they incorporate him into the MCU. ",2,0,MacguffinsTV,xInh3VhAWs8,0.24097222222222225,2015-01-07 04:23:54,True,True

In a separate large bowl, lightly whisk the eggs. Add the milk, sour cream, half the melted butter and the vanilla, whisking to blend. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the egg mixture into it. Whisk the ingredients together just until blended. Fold the blueberries and lemon zest into the batter. Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat and coat with some of the remaining melted butter. For each pancake, pour about 1/4 cup of the batter into the hot skillet. Cook 3 or 4 pancakes at a time, depending on the size of the skillet. If the batter seems too thick, thin it with 1 to 2 tablespoons milk.

Whenever there's a change of directors, people normally accept the product. But Ant-Man? I'm sorry, but this movie needs Edgar Wright. I don't think Kevin Feige could even save this film.  The thing is, I'm not against humor, but it was how Marvel just destroyed it with this trailer. This film should've been an Edgar Wright film. Marvel had a chance of making a fantastic movie. However, they screwed up because they didn't like the idea of Edgar directing an Edgar Wright film rather than just the usual Marvel film. If this movie receives horrendous reviews, we'll know why.  Here's how I'll sum up my rant. Edgar Wright received the Sony treatment. Meaning Marvel interfered heavily with Edgar's work and changed it so it could work with their ""precious little universe"" and have humor as one of the most important aspects rather than a good story. Edgar didn't want to take any bull crap. He realized that creating something he was truly interested was more than receiving a pay check. So he left. And now the movie will suffer from it.

My only gripe were the out of place comedy. I felt the same way with Thor 2. I am all for lighthearted films and TV. The GotG looked good because it was showcased as a lighthearted fun packed adventure. When I watched the Thor 2 trailer, it came off as very serious and when I watched it I was put off because the humor was placed in times that needed that emotional impact. It is like watching an anime where there is a serious scene and all of a sudden there is out of place fan service. It really takes me out of the moment. I wouldn't mind at all for this to be a really lighthearted film. I just think Marvel sometimes has a habit of badly combining the humor and serious moments.

But the capablities of the fx guys in making it seem real have to move on each decade as well, otherwise there's no wow factor, it just looks fake.  This trailer has a tantalizing glimpse of something that looks like it's in the right, thought-out area.  The surface of what he lands on while shrunk appears pitted just as you'd expect close up, i.e. it doesn't suffer from the syndrome of previous films of this kind (e.g. ""Honey.."") by having, e.g., child's building blocks look as smooth-surfaced magnified as they look normally.  The ant fx look pretty good too (although, note to the sound-design guy: you can't just sample a helicopter and palm it off as ant's wings close up, need to juzz it up a bit more).  If this film gets it right and wows us with that sort of stuff, it should be a hit.  If the makers have forgotten this USP, and tried to make some kind of deep emotional movie (which, worryingly, the trailer also seems to portray), then it could be Marvel's first real duffer.",0,0,gurugeorge,xInh3VhAWs8,0.1762445887445887,2015-01-07 06:58:10,True,True

The dead pool trailer looks cool but I hear that they are going for a PG13 rating so kinda disappointed with that. As for ant man I never read the comics I'm just a huge movie buff n this shit looks hokey. I can honestly say marvel has done some great films over the years n I've seen them all but I doubt I'll pay to see this in the theaters. I'm feeling like they need to go darker show some violent deaths and pain to add more depth to these characters. For me the best reboot was Chris Nolan's dark knight and sad to say that wasn't marvel. However The X-man and Iron man transition to film have been awesome.

I'm very optimistic about this movie, I really think this is gonna be the biggest surprise of the year. Kind of how Edge of tomorrow was a huge surprise last year. I'm a big Marvel fan so even if its okay I will still love it. I'm really tired of dark and gritty so I really prefer Marvels lighter tone. In my opinion dark and gritty only works for Dark characters. For example Batman must be done that way because his character is dark, Superman didn't work that way in my opinion. DC should not follow the example that all there movies must be dark, The Flash is a character with a lighter tone, we've seen that with the TV show and it works brilliantly, Green Lantern is a lighter character, sure that didn't work the first time but doing making him darker wouldn't work that well. Wonder Woman can go both ways. My point is there are times when we need a lighter tone in super hero movies and for the most part those times are most of the times. I'm not saying that every Marvel movie needs to be light and kid friendly, for example Black Panther should in no way be comedic, sure it can have its laugh here in there but for the most part it should be serious. I think I great example of a more serious marvel film is the Winter Soldier, that was an excellent movie that did have laughs but it kept a more serious tone that worked very well for the film. Now with that rant over I have to say that I am very excited for Ant-man!

Combine it with the fact Scott Lang is a reformed master thief and we've got the Avengers new infiltration specialist.  Plus he's no slouch in a fist fight and can use his shrinking/growing abilities in really unique ways.  The Pym particles ensure that he retains his human sized strength no matter how small he gets.  If he could lift 300 pounds while normal sized, he can STILL lift 300 pounds while ant sized.  It does not scale, meaning at ant size he can deck a full grown man and knock them out, or (since everyone brings it up) shove a guy's foot into the air like it's nothing if they tried to step on him.

The ONLY super-hero movie that I've ever really loved was The Dark Knight, cause I think that's perfect example of movie that you can really enjoy even if you are not fan of DC/Batman or even havent watched the first movie (Batman Begins)  From Marvel movies, Guardians and Thor movies have been the most enjoyable to me, Avengers was REALLY overhyped but ok as were first and thid Iron Mans....the 2nd one sucked ass.

Epic comic book movie that is FUN - which is what it should be, not 3 hours long with 30mins of the hero and then have another one defeat the villain - and is the 3rd highest grossing film of all time. DC seem like they are playing catch-up. Rushing in loads of films and not really thinking about it. Batman v Superman is basically Justice League and everything following it seems a bit random. JL Part 1 and Part 2? I bet they haven't even thought of storylines or anything for any of these future movies.

2015-01-07T17:35:47,"I'm worried about this film, which is something that hasn't happened with previous Marvel films. This trailer failed to generate any kind of excitement or enthusiasm in me, something that GOTG did in spades with its initial teaser. I like that it plays as a Heist film in order to keep the films feeling different, but I dunno. I'm not sold on it yet. My main concern is that the initial premise for the film that set the foundation for it was in place before there was a Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I hope that trying to fit the story within the MCU mold of branching story lines doesn't somehow compromise the initial vision of the film which is why Edgar Wright departed in the first place. I hope for the best, but I have far less warm and fuzzy feelings for this than GOTG generated and ultimately responded to.   On a positive note, the suit looks pretty badass, and people questioning how useful he can be when he shrinks (why don't you just step on him) don't realize that the more he shrinks down, the stronger he gets inversely. Therefore little bug size Ant-Man hits like a freight train. I'm sure the next trailer will emphasize Paul Rudd's role more to better gauge how he fits the role. Rudd is capable of delivering some solid performances, so I hope he doesn't come across as a Star Lord clone. Marvel has been on point with their casting for the most part, and the initial casting of Rudd seemed an odd choice so I'm curious to see what shape his character will take.

Where are the original screenplays at? Or why not create an entirely new superhero at the very least? Think outside the box. If they're making movies and tv shows centered around a lesser known superhero and an even lesser known minor comic book character, then there's truly no end to this. Ant-Man doesn't even have exciting enough powers for this movie to bring in tons of non-Marvel Comics fans like say Spider-Man, Batman or Superman can. I understand introducing Ant-Man is buildup for Age of Ultron... but still.  Marvel needs to step it up though.

It could be a modern day revision of They Live. Killing assortment of people who were Aliens in disguised.  6. Ectokid: Wachowski siblings worked at Marvel before they did Matrix and they could reintroduced there character which would make there old comic a collectors item. They could get Clive Barker to make a script.  7. Shang Chi Master of Kung Fu vs the Masters of Evil: Have a Bruce Lee knock off go out and fight a huge assortment of Marvel Super Villains like Stilt Man, or Baron Zemo 8. Rocket Racer : Its a black kid with a flying jet powered skate board !  9. MoonKnight: Marvels Schizophrenic Batman  10.

Scott Lang was the second Antman , in the comics stealing the suit from Pym to commit a robbery to save his daughter who was ill and ultimately saving a woman whom saved his daughters life. Pym seeing this act bestowed the title Antman onto Scott lang.  Also the MCU is not the comics so we will see some things twisted and new plots for the average moviegoer , but the fans i believe will be satisfied with the film, lately Marvel can do no wrong, i'm excited to end out phase 2 and bring in the expansion of the mcu , with magic , and the cosmos more , and with the introduction on Black panther , the Inhumans , Dr. Strange , and setting these movies all in touch with each other , its going to be very interesting to see how they fit Scott Lang into the picture after never having Hank Pym in the MCU ! == Your thoughts on how the Antman film will tie into future avengers films , as in Infinity war part one and Part 2 , anyone ? . ==",0,0,BewArEobliVioN ISatHand,xInh3VhAWs8,0.10598484848484849,2015-01-07 21:00:13,True,True
2015-01-07T21:00:20,"Looks pretty good. Even if you think it doesn't show you much, just have to squint, look closer and appreciate the little things as I do, ha. Nice cityscape shots and of the bridge, leading me to believe this is in San Fran, a new city in which to see the MCU take place. I liked that we got to see a building with Pym's name on it, leading me to believe that maybe he's a rich scientist like Stark, so that if/when RDJ's contract does end with Cap 3: Civil War, we'll have another billionaire scientist/financier for the Avengers to continue onward without Iron Man. The suit looks awesome and pays great respect to the source materials. This coming from a card collector, not a comicbook reader. Even if some will complain that we've got a level-headed, rational Pym here instead of fans only remembering the few negative characteristics about him (psychological and domestic abuse issues awry), I like the dynamic between him and thief Scott Lang. Sure we didn't get much in jokes or humor from Rudd, but maybe more will come (the ""huh"" was definitely amusing). I'm happy with the action we saw, akin to the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids tiny perspective on everyday objects such as a grimy bathtub and an ant-fly serving as a helicopter-like mode of transportation (need to note that the helmet gives him communication capability with ants). Even if you would rather see more of a younger Pym in action as the 1st Ant-Man, maybe we'll get some of that in flashback (Peggy Carter is listed in the cast, of course) or even in Agent Carter's show, which covers her aftermath of WW2 in 1946 grieving Cap, maybe witnessing the dawn of the Winter Soldier, seeing when, where and why Howard Stark's partnership with Anton Vanko goes sour and maybe even a young Hank Pym is introduced (and maybe young Janet Van Dyne as well if she's not to be in this film) and first discovers his namesake particles.  While not much was seen of any supporting players, at least we did get to see them and can thirst for more. The suited villain that overtakes Pym's company akin to Jeff Bridges's Obadiah Stane, I guess. If that same format as Iron Man 1 (as IM1 is still considered 1 of the better MCU films, thanks to Favreau kicking it all off) comes into this, that's still ok as the film will instead be about a heist to save the world instead of iron mongers battling to control it, so to speak. And raven-wigged Evangeline Lilly, said to be playing Hope Van Dyne, looked alright. Now, fans will recognize that surname of course, but the pre-spoiler is that she's Pym's daughter, obviously. We'll have to see how she factors into this film, if she'll become the Wasp or not yet. I never would've thought the superhero codename ""Ant-Man"" was something that someone would want to change. It's certainly better than ""Bug Boy"", right? But that's impressive Marvel is able to make a joke out of that for us. For those that don't like the humor, too bad. Humor is in ""comic""books, inevitably, unless you're all serious like DC. So, I applaud Marvel Studios for giving us this tiny 116-second glimpse into the movie that comes after Avengers: Age of Ultron, kicking off Phase 3. Considering all the hubbub around big-name Edgar Wright's departure (the dude wanted to make this a buddy comedy and standalone film away from the MCU, to go with rebellious, independent film vibe) and getting replacements with only 1 comedy on their resumes but making up for it by being fans of the comics (which is actually more important, if you look at the movie track records for Marvel Studios films thus far: all the successful ones were done by fans of the comics, not necessarily big resumes), I say well done.

2015-01-07T23:57:26,"I have to agree at least to an extent with the person who pointed out  'Do you see what they are doing here, having the other guy instead of Pym"". Pym IS a darker character, suffering from mental instability, sometimes turning on his allies, even abusing his wife. None of these things will probably be touched in the movie, he will be rewritten into the benifical old guy while the spotlight is put on the 'redemption' character of the thief. In a way, I think it's sort of bad yet in another, I Do like the idea of 'cleaning up' some of these characters. Stark is more charismatic, more ADD genius, not as big of a backstabber and doesnt seem to be a literal alcoholic on the degree comic Stark is. (Yet to me Cap in avengers just didnt feel.... well.. like CAPTAIN AMERICA!!! He strikes me as being two steps above being Kid America! I felt a lil better about Winter Soldier but still.. ) Hopefully they wont show the twisted, messed up version of stark that was in that awful Civil War storyline. Or try to water cap down into an unstable old idealistic war veteran that people are following...not because they agree with him in some cases but... just because. Still, what was done with Tony was crazy. Tony can be bad, but not THAT BAD. Now if they used something that just NEEDS to be SERIOUSLY cleaned up, really badly, that's it.

With all of the mess that happened during production + this underwhelming bit of footage, I fear this looks to be the most yawn-worthy entry in the Marvel stable since Thor 1.  To those who follow comic books: Stop acting like people should know who Ant-Man is. There's a reason why they don't. While his accomplishments on paper are big among the long-time fans of the long-running Avengers books, he's been so down played outside of the funny pages that he's about as unknown to pop culture as Joe Schmo down the street. Spouting off your trivia isn't going to sell them on Ant-Man, either. You know what would? Slow trickle marketing similar to that of Guardians of the Galaxy. They knew that was an absurd idea, so they gave you something to laugh about at the beginning for a taste before introducing the meat in the longer trailers. This?  ...This, sadly, looks to be a hodgepodge thrown together at the last minute, much like some of the changes occurring in production. As a fan of comics, action movies, comic book movies, etc, this looks to be about as good as such classics as...90% of Fox's comic book movie catalog: generic and formulaic and safe.

Today im trying out for my band at local music/arts ceneter and im scared out of my mind to even try. But i just realized last night,why should i be scared or nervous? If have enough to nerve to even sign up,then i have enough to atleast try. Then it got me thinking more,we all tend to hesitate jumping into the unknown cause we're scared (and the only thing scary here is my grammar) of being humiliated and hurt. Being humiliated/embarrassied is really bad,and being physically or even emotionally hurt is probably even worse. But the worse thing of all im talking so bad it will drive you mad,is NOT even trying at all. How do you know what it will feel like or look like if you don't even try?! It's better to try failing than never trying at all. At least you can learn from your mistakes failing unlike not trying and NOT knowing what you needed to do. As P!nk would put it,""But just because it burns doesnt mean you're  gonna die you gotta get up and try try try"" and i/you should get up and try no matter what the consequences. Be thr kid to stand up for the bully at school. Be nice to everyone (even your parents).   And i hope this encourages somebody today/tonight. Think of it as this way. You're the superhero and fear/humiliation is the villian and its keeping your dreams as a captive. As the hero,you're supposed to save the day,but you're scared of the enemy at first. Giving you these thoughts of,""You'll never make it"" or ""Just give up before you make yourself a fool!"" so you try to attack it. You may win (hopefully) but you may lose. If you lost....the enemy will just laugh at you making you feel bad for trying. But when you come back, you'll be stronger because you learned from your mistakes. But you learned a major weakness to the enemy. What it says is BS! You may lose people on the way,but if they left you to begin with,they where really not there for you or they're making space for people who really care! So go ahead,take a superhero punch into fear and say ""Im not having your BS"" today or this year! Take it out and save the captive (your dream). Good luck with your day!

2015-01-11T09:11:11,"all these people turning into a obvious trolls, jumping on the band wagon of making fun of something you can't understand. All these negative comments are done literally by idiots. Too busy judging the movie or the Character before it comes out. Did the same with GOTG, Captain America, X-men and the list goes on and on. Why insult a movie you know you'll see? Why insult it if you won't, cause logically you can't because you didn't?? Its funny how people always have something to complain about always! They've even tricked themselves into not liking movies which they loved in the past because of comparing it to others. Even tho Hero movies have separate genres!    Ant-Man is the most underestimated character of all time! Both versions, but both of their dramatic stories, clever personalities and courage makes them interesting.People always want a true underdog to root for, they get one and then they COMPLAIN. Always Complaining instead of thinking.   Comic Writers saw the importance in Ant-man. Few characters EVER have had such impact on the Marvel Universe. Writers always added layers of dimensions on the Ant-men. Addicts, abusers, multi-personality, pacifism, thievery,  bad father figure and that goes on.  The Characters themselves are a gold mine, that is why writers still write them after 50+ years!! If all you care about when it comes to heroes is the powers and name. Then all you care about is what they can do and how they look doing it! Instead of Why they do it, how they can do and wow they did it!   Plus his powers are extremely practical and useful for espionage and thievery. He has extremely clever ways of using his powers. Its not all about combat, the movie can be smart too and not for idiot who just wants to see explosions.  Also any normal henchmen, terrorist or criminal couldn't stand a chance against someone so fast, strong and agile and at a practically invisible size.   Then lets add you failed to be impressed by the awesome Cast! The source Material loving director, the work of two other source material loving directors, the great stunt team and producers. While not realizing you are getting new additions too the beloved Cinematic Universe. The first comic one EVER.  People who aren't impressed by impressive things are ignorant, ungrateful and immature.  Like a five your old who didn't get the exact game he wanted but his parents got him one just as good, but still he whines and cries. Throws a fit over the smallest of things.  Who knows if he would stop comparing it to the other game he might learn to love and grow attach to the one his parents got him.  ",31,8,The Ministerial Nerd,xInh3VhAWs8,0.1674804362304362,2015-01-11 09:11:11,True,True

And while this character does have a sense of humor, the movie itself doesn't feel like a comedy. Avengers, had some good laughs. But it wasn't a comedy. Avengers 2 looks serious and epic.

And it's not just the trailer that has me worried; it's the director. We all know Edgar Wright was supposed to be directing this but left the project (which he worked almost a decade on) due to creative differences with Marvel. And who do they get to replace him? Peyton Reed, of course! Reed has directed movies such as The Break-Up, Yes Man, Down with Love, and Bring It On...all pretty 'meh' movies, and not just in my opinion, but in the opinions of critics and audiences alike. Edgar Wright, on the other hand, has had much more critical success with his films like Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. So where am I going with this? Well, a director's movies says a lot about his directing skills...and Reed is no Wright. There's always a chance that Reed can surprise me and deliver a memorable and worthy Marvel film. But looking at his track record, I don't think that'll be the case. There's no doubt that Ant-Man will be a financial success, due to everybody's trust in Marvel, but I don't think it'll garner the same critical success Edgar Wright's version would have gotten. And if it does fail critically, I hope Marvel comes to terms with Edgar Wright and brings him back for Ant-Man's inevitable sequel. ",0,0,Avatar Daang,xInh3VhAWs8,0.09276819923371647,2015-01-14 22:13:02,True,True

2015-02-16T22:51:41,"*This movie bullshit because isn't being made about the cool Ant-Man, Hank Pym. This movie is about one-trick pony Ant-Man Scott Lang, who can only shrink. My objection to this movie is that they're eliminating Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne from their own storyline in The Avengers and the Marvel Universe and making this movie about one-note superhero Scott Lang, who is a boring character that has nothing to do with the Avengers. Allow me to explain:*  *The original Ant-Man is Hank Pym, a young genius scientist who discovered the Pym particles - subatomic nano-particles that can alter the mass of an object. He can use the particles to either decrease his size or increase his size. As Ant-Man, Hank can shrink down to near-microscopic size while retaining full-size strength, because the particles increase his body density while reducing his mass. This gives him incredible speed and agility when he shrinks because his weight is reduced to nearly nothing while his strength is constant. He can also shrink and grow so fast that it seems like he's invisible or teleporting because he can be in front of you one second and behind you the next.*  *Hank Pym can also increase in size as Giant-Man, which is basically Ant-Man with a ""G"" and an ""I"" in front of the ""A."" As Giant-Man, Hank Pym can increase in size to over 100 feet in height, and his strength increases in proportion to his size, giving him superhuman physical power. At 10-15 feet, he's as strong as Captain America, able to lift close to a ton of weight. At 20-25 feet, Hank is as strong as Spider-Man, able to lift 10 tons. At 50 feet, Hank is close to Iron Man level strength, and at 100 feet tall, Hank is at near Hulk-level strength, which is the ""Class 100"" level, able to lift 100 tons. Hank can grow even taller and go well into the Class 100 level, but he can't maintain those sizes for long because of the great amount of strain it puts on his body, as much of his strength is needed just to support his increased mass. So 100 feet is usually his maximum.*  *The combination of these abilities makes Hank Pym's Ant-Man/Giant-Man combination a formidable superhero and one of the most powerful in the Marvel Universe. Hank would later abandon the Ant-Man identity and become known under knew identities such as Goliath and Yellowjacket over time. And his long-time love interest, Janet Van Dyne, The Wasp, has the same size-changing abilities that Hank has. She also can fly using bio-mechanical wings that Hank created for her that grow from her back, and can project bio-electrical energy blasts, or ""bio-stings."" Both Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne co-founded The Avengers, along with Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, and later Captain America. Hank Pym also created Ultron and was responsible for defeating him later on. Janet Van Dyne was at one point the leader of the Avengers after Captain America's departure from the team, and both Hank and Janet have been in most of the Avengers' most important storylines over the last 40 years.*  *But Hank and Janet have been excluded entirely from the Marvel Cinematic Universe because Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige chose instead to use an old 2004 script written by Edgar Wright, which was intended to be a comedic stand-alone heist film back when Artisan Entertainment still held the film rights to Ant-Man. Wright's script was never meant to be part of any larger movie universe and had nothing at all to do with the Avengers, The Wasp, Ultron, or any other Marvel storylines. His script centered on Scott Lang, the second Ant-Man who took over the role after Hank gave up the identity and became Giant-Man/Goliath full time. But Scott Lang does not grow in size, and he's basically nothing more than a thief who shrinks. And Edgar Wright made Hank Pym an old man in his script, which pretty much makes it impossible for Hank to be in the Avengers or to create Ultron. And Janet Van Dyne is nowhere in this film. So this movie pretty much sucks because it's being made about a second-rate Ant-Man, and Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne are being excluded from their own story in The Avengers and Ultron storylines, which is totally disrespectful to two of the founding members of The Avengers and two of Marvel's most iconic and important characters.*  *It also makes little sense, since Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne are not only more cinematically compatible with the Avengers storyline in the MCU, they're also way more cinematically appealing as Hank Pym as Ant-Man/Giant-Man is a far more powerful and versatile character than Scott Lang and has way more depth and history, and Janet Van Dyne is one of the best female superheroes in Marvel comics and would bring a much needed female presence to the MCU, which has been mostly male-dominated so far. Eliminating Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne from the MCU by making Hank Pym an old man and taking Janet Van Dyne away from the story entirely and replacing them with a D-list character like Scott Lang, who is limited not only in powers but in story is beyond stupid. Edgar Wright's script was not compatible at all with a shared movie universe and was never intended to be, and Wright eventually had to leave the project entirely because after stalling the film for nearly a decade in development, Kevin Feige himself had to admit that the script wasn't working and didn't fit into the MCU, so using it in the first place was a total waste of time, and Hank and Janet and their fans deserved better.

2015-02-16T23:08:29,"*This movie is bullshit because isn't being made about the cool Ant-Man, Hank Pym. This movie is about one-trick pony Ant-Man Scott Lang, who can only shrink. My objection to this movie is that they're eliminating Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne from their own storyline in The Avengers and the Marvel Universe and making this movie about one-note superhero Scott Lang, who is a boring character that has nothing to do with the Avengers.

He can use the particles to either decrease his size or increase his size. As Ant-Man, Hank can shrink down to near-microscopic size while retaining full-size strength, because the particles increase his body density while reducing his mass. This gives him incredible speed and agility when he shrinks because his weight is reduced to nearly nothing while his strength is constant.
