2014-11-08T14:45:59,"Okay for those bitching about Annie being black, let me explain you a thing. This is supposed to be a modern remake, the original Annie had red hair to imply that she was Irish, the Irish were looked down upon and there was a lot of prejudice against people of Irish descent. So This Annie is black because nowadays being Irish isn't really an issue regarding repression and discrimination, it doesn't make you less likely to be adopted or get you treated badly or leave you the victim of inequalities. However, despite most people claiming they are not racist, racism particularly towards black people in America is a large problem, you are also much less likely to be adopted if you are a black LAC (Looked After Child). So this is why Annie in this modern remake is not red haired or Irish, simple. If you still think Annie being cast this way is a problem after reading why then you're probably racist so stop leaving racist comments here and start commenting on UKIP videos instead with your other bigoted and small minded friends.",10,0,the1princefrank,F6lNi7cZ-Ho,0.0017378215654077853,2014-11-08 14:45:59,True,True

Annie still has all the ""big white woman heart"" bull Hollywood is always trying to shove down people's throat.

2014-12-15T15:14:10,""".... If you grew up all all your life knowing that the character of Annie is & was white , even before you were born that Annie has always been written & portrayed as a white character & all of a sudden you go to the movies now & watch Annie as a black girl , this impostor , it really doesn't allow yourself to get deeply involved into the movie. It just doesn't fit the mold or fall into place because you know in the back or even thr front of your mind that you know Annie as & always will be portayed as a white girl & all of a sudden , no matter how much you try to force yourself to be open minded that Annie is somehow a black gil now , your mind will not allow yourself to get into that mode of involvement. Your brain knows better than that. You have trained your brain to know that Annie is & always will be a white girl character no matter how much you want to change it for a couple of hours. My knowing for all my life that Annie is a white girl & all of a sudden I am supposed to go with the pretend idea that Annie is black does not jibe with what I have always known & have seen her as a white girl all my life growing up. No way can I fool my brain into watching this movie & seriously allowing my brain to be open to Annie being a white girl when all I can picture in my mind is the original 1982 movie of Aileen Quinn being the one & only one to play Annie. To force your mind to see a black girl play a white girls movie part is impossible knowing what you have known all your life as a black girl playing a white girl's part. It has nothing to do with racism. It has to do with what you have known all your life from childhood & what your mindset of your  brain is trained in knowing visually & how the books are written & told as it's being depicted for going on 32 years now. You cannot fool or trick or manipulate your brain into thinkikng or knowing that Annie is a black girl all of a sudden. There is no way you can wrap your mind around Annie being portrayed by a black girl knowing what you have known all your life growing up as Annie being none other than a white girl. Common sense & knowing better will not allow your mind to sit through a movie with a black girl playing Annie knowing what you know going through your entire life knowing that reading cartoon books or comic books & stories about Annie being addressed as a white character. I don't know of anyone who can convince their mind that Annie is now a black character knowing what it knows for all this time that Annie is & was written & depicted as a white girl based character. To think anyone can trick their minds into getting deeply involved in this movie seriously as Annie as a black girl knowing what they know of Annie being a white girl character is just being naive. When your brain knows for decades or all your life that Annie is a white girl & this crap comes along , your brain starts to parent you into telling you to get real. Your life long knowledge of Annie always being a white girl portrayed & written character can't help , but to take over.

When racist people make their stand their is no point in arguing with them. They will make their decision on their stance and use the most ludicrous of examples to prove their point.  A lot of the commenters are stating that this movie shouldn't be remade with a black person and using the pretense that africans wouldn't like if ""roots"" (the most common example I saw) was remade using white people.   Roots.  Yes people. Roots.  They want a white man to play a slave, but they want black people to actually be the slaves for hundreds of years.  Roots Is a movie that represents a snapshot in time with distinctive rolls that must be maintained in order to not break the authenticity or immersion. (Similar reasoning can be used for the exodus movie.)  Annie is a character.  Created in a comic book. Her main characteristics that define her do not have a specific race attached. There are Orphans of all races in America. When you think orphan do you think of a specific race? Now when you think slave what comes to mind?  The answer to those two questions is obvious. They answered it in the exodus movie where all, or most of the Slave roles were inhabited by black people.  Yes, I do understand that Annie was very much characterized by her red hair, but you must under stand this is a remake that takes place In a different time period.

I usually reacted the same before. Silly example, Harry Potter, book HP has green eyes, movie HP has blue eyes. That alone annoyed me. I learned not to make a big deal out of it, and I really don't care anymore about changes and adaptation, but not everyone is the same.

This appears to be some group home with bunk beds. A foster home has limits to how many kids a couple or a single person can have. Nobody's homke is this large & nobody who runs a foster home has a whole slu of kids in them. Again , this is more of a group home than a foster care or foster home setting. No foster parents have this many kids in them. They can say it's a foster home in this movie all they want , but it still appears to be an updated version of an orphanage or group home setting. It looks a lot like a C.P.S.

It was a nice re-imagining of the story, not just a re-telling. It didn't come off as ""forced"". There was diversity without being heavy-handed or insulting—it wasn't steeped in stereotypes or a ""Hey, white people—you suck"" message. The music takes some liberties from the original classics, but they fit this new version. Quvenzhané Wallis has a lot of heart, and Jamie Foxx and Rose Byrne are great in their roles. They do a good job of making you ""feel"" the characters.  If you haters really want to get butt-hurt, go watch Disney's craptastical 1999 TV-movie version.

She's way too attractive to play Mrs. Hannigan. And I'm really sorry for people who think that everything is about color. It's not about color. Plus, most of the most successful people are black.

And it's not about looks or color, it's about abilities. Yeah, she might be a better singer but she just doesn't have the originality that the first Annie had. The first movie had something really special. I don't know what it is, I think it's that all the kids were childish and didn't wanna grow up so fast.

The Princess and the Frog (2009) got almost no perfect scores because people hated that Tiana was black and all these critics are used to British storybooks where every one is black. Even Ghostbusters II, Basically no perfect scores. Why? They added a black character protagonist.  Having a black Annie doesn’t change the movie. At all.  Heck, go as far as to make a boy Annie (of course they’d have to settle on a completely different name) and I’d be fine, but most of the internet will say “They ruined Annie!”  Also, why is the remake called “trash”?  The only thing I didn’t like was that there were more girls and it didn’t have those extra songs like “Sandy’s His Name or “Dumb Dog”  I like how they changed the story a bit, how they put Annie in the modern world, and everything else.
