Her power is also an expression of her personality. I don't like being the person who says read the books, but seriously. Do yourself a favor. The books, as others have said, also have a creepy undertone. Ransom Riggs does a fabulous job of weaving in creepy black and white photos that help with the visualization. It's what appealed to me right off the bat when i picked up the first book and I thought that since Tim Burton was working on this that it would carry over the creepy vibe but it didn't, at all. There is so much brightness and color and not at all like the books described. I love Eva Green so Miss P being so young doesn't bother me as much as I mind (who i assume is) Bronwyn being so young. Bronwyn plays the role of a protector in the books and here she's a little kiddo. And lastly, that was a cheap hollowgast at the end but that's just me being picky.

I have no problems with that. 3)The Hollowgast at the end looks great(it still could have been better, but at least they're being faithful to the book). 4)My main concern is that Burton is going to ignore the history of Jacob's grandfather with Emma which is definitely not ok because to me that was one of the most interesting facet of Emma and Jacob's friendship/relationship, and a very interesting concept for me when I was reading the books. I hope that this isn't true. Oddly enough I'm not as upset that they've interchanged Emma's power with another's as much as I thought I would be. Slightly disappointing and sort of pointless to do so, but it's overlook-able.

2016-03-16T08:23:57,"Just a friendly reminder that directors don't make the trailers, the marketing people do. Marketing people want to make a film look appealing to a wide audience and so they edit together little clips into what is basically a sales pitch. Trailers aren't supposed to capture the tone or the 'spirit' of the actual film, they're supposed to get as many bums on seats as possible. The marketers have probably assumed that fans of the book will go see the film no matter what, and so instead they're trying to get the general public interested with dramatic music, simple gags, cool powers and cliffhangers. Of course, the movie might turn out to be mediocre, or even not good. It might be a fairly loose adaptation of the book, but a good film in and of itself. That all remains to be seen. What I guess I'm trying to say is, it's a bit early to cry 'THIS MOVIE LOOKS SOGGY AND BAD' or 'BURTON BUNGLED IT'.

But this seems too much like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Too campy compared with the source material.  I'm talking about the cinematography and the characters. This was based on a YA book but it feels like it's been toned down for younger audiences. I think that's why. I think they're trying to attract little kids and parents.  Oh well. I'm still gonna watch it just because. And I think it would feel like seeing a new story because so many things are different from the book. I hope it's as refreshing as they make it appear to be.

Yeah, the trailer, for the most part, looks lighthearted, not matching the tone of the book at all.  Yeah, some of the ages of the characters have been changed.  And, yeah, Tim Burton has definitely taken some liberties the readers are having trouble accepting.  Here's the thing, though: the author liked it, and fully condoned all changes made, from peculiarity swaps to age changes.  There's no way that was done for no reason at all.  This makes me believe there's a plot twist or the like that will be exclusive to the movie that they both set up together.  I also happen to think the actress shown to play Miss Peregrine will do a great job.  Besides that, I doubt it is going to be very lighthearted.  I just saw a kid holding a crossbow to a Slenderman/tentacle monster hybrid brought forth from the hottest pits of Hell, also known as a hollowghast.  I'm sorry, but that scene looked badass.  Unless that's the cliffhanger of the movie, I'm pretty sure there's a lot we're not seeing.  I'm just going to assume the most thrilling scenes are being saved for the movie.  So, c'mon people.  Let's try being positive.  ""Dark Shadows"" aside, Tim Burton has a pretty decent track record with things like this.  Remember ""Big Fish""?

This is a damaging film and unrepresentative towards America...films like this are losing credibility (and money) because ignorant people with money are making films. I was so excited about this film but as a minority I am disappointed and will opt out to see it. It is so damaging and frustrating that minorities are never represented in these films. Diversity is beautiful from the palest Irish person to the darkest African person. It's sad that so many people can't see that and block out so many potential relationships and good friendships because of something as simple as skin colour. :-/ #NEXT! #Back2TheLatestStarWars which has a black male lead AND female lead! #2016...,0,1,Posh Prince,tV_IhWE4LP0,-0.062301587301587316,2016-03-17 06:13:08,True,True

2016-03-19T23:58:25,"Ok, so out of 13 characters, only Jacob, Claire, Horace and both ymbrynes are unchanged.  1.- According to this trailer and IMDB's casting page, Emma and Olive have changed peculiarities, also making Olive WAY older.  2.- Millard, Fiona and Hugh are much younger, they're supposed to be in Jacob's and Emma's (physical) age range.  3.- Bronwyn is also way younger. 4.- Enoch is portrayed as old or older than Jacob.  I can live with 2, 3 and 4, since honestly, age doesn't make that much of a difference, however, why would you butcher and then piece together as you wish the characters of Emma and Olive? Emma's peculiarity is on the verge of being a superpower, central to the character, her name, and her history with Abe Portman. Olive on the other hand, is a human helium balloon, she's not an airbender.   I will see the movie, I am sure I will like it, I mean, the world just looks fascinating and strangely marvelous, Tim Burton's a good director and Jane Goldman a good writer, but how could they possibly believe it would be a good idea to change a mutate a core character and sort of merge it with another? I know novels are almost never translated exactly as they are to the silver screen, but things that change can be settings, ages, etc; maybe even actions, but not characters central to the story.  I love the novels, they're wonderful, so I do sincerely hope the movie holds up against them, since with only the change mentioned in point number 1 is enough to make it a ''What if?'' regarding the original story of the novel",0,0,Silver Small News,tV_IhWE4LP0,0.27857323232323233,2016-03-19 23:58:25,True,True

""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" If you are going to read this book, or want to read it before the movie comes out, I highly suggest you read all 3 books in the series. It is more along the lines of one giant book cut into 3. I enjoyed the 3rd book the most and truly wish they would have delved deeper into Devils Acre. I also enjoyed the Capitalist character Sharon who ran his boat tours to Devils Acre. I don't want to give any spoilers, but I (given my politics) do not really enjoy how the ymbrynes run the show. If they do create more to the series, I hope they truly tap into this. I did not really like it that you had to somewhat wait till the 3rd book to really start to get meat on the bones of the back ground story setting and what not. I also did not like that the antagonist all used weapons, but the protagonist group were just stupid when it comes to any type of weapon. The books definitely have a liberal slant, and I was often rooting for the antagonist group. They were good reads. If you enjoy super hero, super power, school settings, children in danger, type settings you will enjoy these books. Hope this review helped you.

2016-03-30T16:53:40,"So many things I'm disappointed about with this adaptation. I just read all 3 books and absolutely adored them. As I read it I imagined this dystopian world with bleak dull surroundings and only colourful traits were the children's abilities. But there's so much colour in this I was shocked especially coming from Tim burton. He turned an otherwise creepy story with unsettling vintage photographs into a joke. The book had so much potential to become a horror based adult drama.Then I was disappointed at miss peregrines character. I love Eva green in penny dreadful don't get me wrong but expected miss peregrine to be older and more strict given away by the photographs. Same goes for brownyn and millard. As for Emma I'm so annoyed they gave her olives power as that would only mean there will be a drastic change in plot. I'd give it to asa butter field to being Jacob as he seems to fit my manifestation of Jacob in my mind from the books, plus he was great in the boy in striped pyjamas. The Hollows features look reasonably accurate but the reality of it was  let down by the comical cgi. Completely killed the thrill factor for me but its 2016 so any hopes of costume or animatronics has been thrown out the window. All in all, not impressed but seems as I can't make judgement from a 2 minute trailer I will watch the film and maybe it will grow on me. It looks good for a children's film but I just expected more coming from fantastic books. Eh.",21,3,Kira sj,tV_IhWE4LP0,-0.05814043209876542,2016-03-30 16:53:40,True,True

2016-04-13T23:15:57,":( I'm a little disappointed in this trailer. I suppose they have it setup like an x-men trailer to boost interest but it seems to be confusing people into thinking it is something like x-men. It's not supposed to be. They're not mutants with 'powers' that want to save the world from other mutants. They're just kids with oddities that exist and are hiding. I really hope Emma's fire character is in the films, she was the coolest character. I normally Love Tim Burton, but this film like his last two, looks a bit too campy and Disney. sorry. Maybe if they started the trailer like the beginning of the book where his grandfather is telling him about the children and he's exploring the old version of the house it would be a bit more unique and pull people in. Then get into the children's peculiarities and the wights. That would be a better intro and explain it in a not so xmen way. I first read the book because it looked so dark and was well written. This trailer makes the film look so mainstream. I like the casting though. I'm sure the studio knows what they are doing and have multicultural'd it up where possible.",0,0,twistedtippy22,tV_IhWE4LP0,0.009558823529411776,2016-04-13 23:15:57,True,True

2016-04-14T03:28:15,Seriously though? Riggs best feature in his writing is how well he describes each peculiar child and their attributes. He literally handed it to them on a silver platter And even provided pictures in the book for each character. Did they even read ANY of the books in the series because how can you change one of the main characters peculiarities?

2016-09-03T22:28:12,"Here are the inconsistencies from the book, from what I can see: 1: The Home is underwater, which did not happen in the book.  2: Olive did not introduce him to the Home, he chased Emma there. 3: Bronwyn was around 13 if I am not mistaken, not 8. 4: Olive does not have the ability to fill underwater areas with air. She also was about 6 or 7, and wore a headpiece. Her power stemmed from being lighter than air, so she had to be anchored with leaden shoes, which were shown. - All of this aside, I think the cast looks pretty good, especially Claire and Jake.

Is this where Young Adult novels are going now?  Instead of ripping off Twilight and Hunger Games, we've moved on to ripping off comic books now?

Is there going to be some magic wave of energy that turns people into giant hulking green beasts?  Are we going to see Gods come down and mingle with humans?

Perhaps the movie didn't follow the book exactly, but I think the details added and taken away also made up for a really good piece of entertainment!  They were both so well done, it's so hard to choose which one is better.  Then again, I'm not sure I'd really want to.  Having them both be so wonderful on their on is perfectly okay with me.  Though, to anyone who's read the books and hasn't seen the movie, or vise versa, I highly recommend you watch the movie/read the books.  The differences aren't quite appealing at first, but you'll (most likely) get used to them, and I think knowing the story from both sides is very fun, so in my opinion you should give it a shot. ^^ ((Then again, if it's not for you, or you don't like movies and/or books, that's fine too ^^))",0,0,Liezart -,tV_IhWE4LP0,0.3684210526315789,2017-01-30 23:58:33,False,False

It was once an orphanage that housed many children in the late 1800's. The experience was both haunting and breathtaking. One of the counselors took us to the cemetery to see a few of the graves of the children who had died where I was staying. The only mansion I would ever consider as one of the great's because of it's history. If I was to ever have a dream, it would be to remain a spirit there after I die.  I will give the name and location but it is not a place to randomly visit if you didn't live there as it is not open to the general public.  The good will farm in Houghton Michigan.   Some of my Best memories were spent living there, the third floor along with the basement was creepy just in general, so I hated laundry day and would run up quickly from the basement when done. The counselors were nice and took us on many outdoor activities.

2019-02-03T12:58:07,"PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU WANT A SEQUEL. SCROLL DOWN TO LAST PARAGRAPH FOR MAIN POINT  Hi guys, I loved this movie sooo much and have been praying for a sequel ever since I watched it in 2016. You won't believe me, for the past 2 years every single week I would check for any news hoping desperately for a sequel. It was rated decently on IMBD and definitely had a nice box office turnout, so the financial assurance is there. I just wanted to say straight away, I'm quite annoyed at the very least of the people complaining about how the movie is bad because it's not like the books, NOT EVERY MOVIE HAS  TO EXACTLY MIRROR THE BOOK. For God's sake...it's called an ""adaptation"" for a reason and I love it.   The opportunity is clearly there, although I can't remember the books exaclty I think they can make a sequel based on the original book trilogy, following with 'Hollow City', or definitely the new trilogy ""Map of days"" - based on the blurb it seems to be a perfect sequel to the events of the movie and thus can easily be adapted.  Down to the point. I have prepared a petition to directly mail Mr Tim Burton himself, I just need the confidence that this community we have that is crying for a sequel still exists. Please LIKE to indicate your support to the petition. Hopefully we reach atleast 50 likes in ~2 months. I know it sounds a lot but if you're reading this, all it takes is just 1 tap and you could make the difference to making our dreams come true. It would be great also if you could possibly just COMMENT your socials email or anything so that I can contact you for the petition when we reach our target. I truly believe we can bring Tim Burton's attention back to this movie, but honestly need your support more than ever.",1,1,Yasin Khan,tV_IhWE4LP0,0.11872830344258917,2019-02-03 12:58:07,False,False

The movie is good as it's own self contained thing and I actually prefer the way it was adapted and stuff more than Harry Potter, because, like LOTR, you get much more content in the book and the movie leaves you yearning for more of that world and then you can go and explore through the books. Even after going back and re-watching it after I finished the first book I still really like it.

2020-06-07T23:14:26,I have to admit at first I was super angry. A lot was different from the books but that was to be expected from Tim Burton cuz he always does that like he did whith Alice in wonderland. But the movie also has some things from the second and 3th books of the peculiar children and I did like that. I hated that everyone was different cuz i fell in love with the character's so much. Enoch is young and a lot more grumpy and weird in the books. Millard is super smart like really smart. Emma is the badass fire girl (NOT shy like the movie) Olive is a little sweet girl not a teenager. Claire is the same tho. The twins are a weird thing cuz in the first book we see a picture of them but not how they died or anything. BUT in the second book we meet 2 twins who are just like them. I loved hem so much.. Hugh is a teenager and is in love with the teenage girl Fiona. Brownyn is also a teenager and not really like she is in the movie. So I guess you can understand my frustration. Tim Burton said in a interview that he didn't even read the book before he changed the character. I'm a huge fan of him but this movie just screams Tim Burton and that isn't always a good thing. Ransom Riggs made the books with so much love and passion Tim was for me in wrong with the character's. But that's my opinion. I loved the ending very good. So.. What I'm trying to say is that you should definitely read the books like I said you will fall in love and never stop. I read the books like 5 times already.
