2014-03-28T04:15:37,"Well after a long long wait we finally get a glimpse of how Michael Bay is going to do the Turtle. I want to say it looks promising. As many people mentioned before I prefured the goofyness of the 90's turtles. Michael Bay want's to be more serious with the turtles. I don't like that very much. I love a good action movie as the next person but The Turtles was a mixture of humor and action for me, and it always blended very well in the older movies (Even the 3rd one. Yes I said it) Nostalgia Critic said it best though "" The older movies aren't going anywhere, you can still enjoy them. It's just people are always going to try for newwer itterations."" He said that after the Avatar movie bombed, and I would also like to add Its up to you the people if these versions of what is now or what once was to be popular. I like Michael Bay as a director, but he really is all Action and advanced CGI. I would have taken the old puppet controlled 90's masks over this cgi stuff. Having said that this might be a good movie provided they make SENSE of the turtles mutation other then they NEEDED hero's (like the ooze accidently falling in the sewers and turtles HAPPENED to find them). Becuase frankly I would be very very pissed if they where all like "" We need hero's to protect our city. We need a symbol. Something that's never been done before. Turtle's yes. Lets make super turtle heros"" If Michael Bay goes that route I will have lost all hope for humanity lol. They better freaken have Splinter in this. I will be upset if he is not apart of this. so here's to him being there and (despite some of the plot changes) here's too hoping this will actually be a good movie. Oh and on a final note, I don't know if I like the voice for Michaelangelo. Just hire back the voice actor from before.

It was combination of a complex NYC gang story fused with supernatural characters and Alien Brains trying to take over the world. The story kept evolving like the mutants themselves. Plus awesome support and main character balances that really brought the story to life.  It was over the top science fiction meets action and had a good balance to it that kept you wanting more. This year is summing up to be pretty good on comic book movies and tv shows. Wish I kept up on my pursuits in this genre of work cause its rewarding seeing people appreciate the creative complexity of comics potential.

2014-03-28T19:44:29,"What people who are killing everyone on here for bashing the film are forgetting ... we all want the same thing.  A good film that  keeps the TMNT fans ( old and new ) happy. I was born in the 1980's ... the beginning of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles popularity when the comics began, the original cartoon began ( and blew up ) and the first 1990 film continued to make the franchise huge. The thing about their look is this, if you can't satisfy the old fans as well as the new, keep them at least similar to what most of us grew up loving and make the movie as well as the original ( so a new generation of kids can love the Turtles like i did as a kid ) then WHY MAKE THE MOVIE? They CLEARLY casted Megan Fox based on name alone, because it'd draw in fans ... but heres the problem... does she fit the character ? probally not. What the director of this film should of learned is that they didn't need a star actress to play April, because using the then unknown Judith Hoag was a great choice because she was April O' Neil. Then you got their look..... the Turtles are twice the size of any human, but in each one of the series ( cartoon, comic book and movies ) the turtles were only a couple of inches taller than them. They were human like turtles ... which is why the mutation made them smarter, stronger ex... than their enemies ( the foot clan ). So why are they seven feet tall ? And why is there complaints about them having noses... noses are what humans have ... and in EVERY one of the turtles cartoons, movies and even in the comic books they never looked that way. If they cant follow simple things like making them look right, why not give them five fingers and toes. Hell why not just give them beards and make them wear t-shirts and pants like humans do. Come on ppl..... if the directors can't even follow simple rules to keeping their origin story, look, ex... right... how do you expect them to make a great movie.  Thats why Spiderman 3 flopped ...they couldn't even get Venom's origin story correct and made the Spiderman character a dancing goof !!! Why do you think the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 movie was so bad? they couldn't even create a great plot for the movie, the costumes looked horrible, and they dumbed down the whole movie.

Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to see a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise.

Hamlet: Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature. For anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must, in your allowance, o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and belloweed that I have though some of Nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.  Player: I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.  Hamlet: O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered.

2014-03-31T20:54:21,"*deep breath*  Okay.  First off, I completely understand that Michael Bay is producing a darker, edgier TMNT. Check. Second off, I understand that he does action scenes, so naturally a movie produced by him will have his signature set of explosions and that it will probably be 60% CG. I understand that it is directed by Jonathan Liebesman, not Michael Bay. I understand that I have no right to call Megan Fox a bad actress. And I understand that Peter Laird wouldn't let anyone truly screw up the TMNT. I also understand that perhaps the backstory of the accident in the sewers still qualifies here.  Here's what I do not understand.  (NOTE: I will not go into details on the large issues with this movie. I feel like the major issues with TMNT fans have been thoroughly in the scathing pool of comments that lurks just beneath mine.)  First off, what's with the lens flares? It's like Star Trek: Into Darkness. At least in Star Trek, where literally everything has to have a blinking light on it, it makes sense. (Don't get me wrong, I love Star Trek.)  Second off, though I know Meagan Fox is a professional actress, I don't think she makes a good April O'Neil. (Then again, I'm not the casting director.) In fact, as I watch her in this trailer, she looks like she doesn't even want to be there, which makes me wonder, ""Then why is she?""  A note to the costume director; at least, for the love of all canon, for the sake of consistency, make her have red hair. That is a must. An absolute must. If April O' Neil is a brunette, you may very well be guaranteed that you'll never hear the end of it.  Thirdly, if Nickelodeon is a patron of this movie, I would hope that it will not be solidly action and petty humor. I like Nickelodeon. What I do not like is an action movie that consists of solid plot exposition for an hour, then suddenly explosions, and then roll credits. Oh, and throw in some bodily humor and screaming Megan Fox. Please do not give me that. You can bet your femur that I will not pay money to sit through two hours of it, that's for sure, and neither will America's parents.  I love TMNT, and I'm trying really, really hard to like this movie. Honestly, I am. But I feel like I'm just getting force-fed Transformers 4: Extraterresturtle Explosions feat. Meagan Fox (Again). But then, who am I to judge?

It doesn't have to follow the original series or be like the classic movies, since they didn't follow the original comic series(which was a little more darker than the laugh out loud version).  So why does this have to be the exact same? It doesn't.  Don't hate things before you even see it based on previous versions.  I remember people freaked out about the newer batman, saying it wont compare to the original 2.  However, it was proven to be an awesome trilogy.  You think by now folks you'd realize things don't always follow the original.  I mean just about all the super hero movies are like that.  This might be an awesome spin on tmnt bringing in some of the original comic style dark with hopefully a little comedic relief as well.  So I'm not going to say I hate or love it till I see it.  So stop your complaining about all the little details, and by the way the yellow jumpsuit would look retarded now, just saying.",1,0,Kyle Langley,VZZ0PnDZdZk,0.1270833333333333,2014-04-01 20:23:23,True,True

It's a nosedive into the uncanny valley.       The puppet Turtles from the 80's live action films seem to represent the Ninja Turtles better because they have beaks and large Muppet eyes, and they look endearing, but this just reminds me of something that is human, and at the same time shouldn't be human.  Very strange, I think.",1,0,Sean Bach,VZZ0PnDZdZk,-0.00777284119389382,2014-04-09 01:08:41,True,True

I mean, it does look a bit weird when you're used to seeing the turtles with the very stylized proportions of a cartoon, but personally, I'm ok with their new appearance, considering how hard it must have been to keep them recognizeable while making them look realistic. Anyway, I never imagined that real-life mutant turtles would be a particularly enchanting sight...  One thing that does bother me though is how the plot is presented so far. From what I understand from this trailer, the ""narrator"", who appears to be an American Shredder (?), is telling April that he and her father worked together (!) and created the turtles (!!) specifically with the intention to make them heroes (!!!) who would somehow help lower the criminality rate in New York... I, just- what ?! Since when has the Shredder cared about the population, where's the Foot Clan ? If he intentionally created the turtles, what reason would he have to be against them, since they're fighting crime just as he apparently wanted (unless he only said that to hide his real motives) ? And what about Splinter's origin story ? Was he also meant to be some kind of mutated superhero, or could it be that he's actually April's father who was victim of yet another lab accident ?!  I'm not sure what to think so far. I wouldn't mind a few changes to the original story, but this new movie looks like a complete reimagining of the entire context, about which I'm a bit skeptical so far. I'm still willing to give it a chance because I think it looks pretty cool anyway, but my appreciation of the movie will mostly depend on the directing, the way the story unfolds and to what extent I can still recognize the characters I love.",0,0,Starcatcher,VZZ0PnDZdZk,0.10010583778966133,2014-04-12 03:17:28,True,True

2014-04-12T09:35:00,"As a die hard TMNT fan, I was really hoping that this movie would bring a look into the darker aspects of this series. I understand the appeal for a redesign, everyone's doing it, Superman, Batman, The Avengers however, with the Turtles who are not just iconic in costume but also their biological form, this will, for most fans, be hard to bare. Yet, this could have been adaptable as long as the movie's other facets held their own. Then you had to shove Megan Fox, an actress who should never haven risen further then the set of a cheesy horror film, into the movie as none other then April O'Neil .... I idolized April as a young girl. She was confident, intelligent and tough, all the while having compassion and understanding. She was a woman worthy of the leading female role next to four, pizzaholic, mutant turtles. I understand reinventing April for the 21st century but throwing in a trashy looking, loud mouthed, wannabe actress with no potential to ever play a woman with anything considered a personality was an obvious down grade. Why not throw us an interesting curve ball? Julianne Hough? Gemma Arterton? Rooney Mara? Someone who, when you think about them, you'd be nodding in a curious satisfaction and be pleasantly surprised when you realized the actress might actually succeed and grow within the amazing role of April.... Instead of filling Megan Fox's pockets with rocks and hoping to hell she'll at least drown while destroying the franchise.

The only reason, seemingly, Foxx would be in this movie is the connections to Bay, or because big boobies. Not cool.  2. The theme of the Ninja Turtles franchise has always been a dirty and slightly grimy, purple paletted smoky and fun crime world New York straight out of a late 80's ninja/action flick. Lens flair, sharp colors and clean streets don't fit the general theme that has been established in the past years.  3. The turtles look like donkey shit smeared in bile and putrefying piss. I don't think it needs to be said that they are too ugly and behemoth shaped to remain relatable. Their comedy will fall flat because of this. But knowing Micheal Bay that won't be a problem, as most of the jokes will be brown anyways.  This is perpetuation of the cancer that is CGI children movies.

Also since Kari has infiltrated the NYP in the mirage comics should I really be surprised to see the foot using guns?

Also what rogue scientist sits in his lab and says ""I have so and so amount of this mutagen and I have turtles... Eureka!""  Turtles were a accident in most of the incarnations of this story which doesn't make it more believable but makes it less like a lapse of judgment on the scientist part. it all holds up for nostalgia addicts but if your just trying to make a new movie  to draw in new fans then I have to say B.S.

2014-04-23T23:42:32,"This looks silly like Transformers.  Basically Michael Bay turned the turtles into CGi Transformer vehicles and they're fake.  The first TMNT movie in 1990 had real actors in real turtle costumes do real martial arts which was better than this CGi nonsense I think. Michael Bay admitted himself that he makes movies for teenage boys.  In order to make movies for the teenage age group it has to go through the MPAA to get a PG-13 rating which means a lot of the more realistic violence, language and adult themes have to be filtered out and dumbed down to appeal to young people.  The reason why Hollywood continues to make these silly unintellectual movies is because there's a big enough audience for it.  Just like how the music industry makes money off Justin Beiber because there's enough people willing to buy Beiber albums.  Just because Hollywood studios and music record companies make money off CGi movies and Beiber albums doesn't mean the taste of the audience is good.",0,0,dolphinsattack,VZZ0PnDZdZk,0.04755291005291004,2014-04-23 23:42:32,True,True

Loser 90's babies/Y-gen hipster dumbasses  who think the turtles should look like the child-safe cartoon version or 90's film versions which were only mildly successful. This camp, which is all the people bitching and whining here, don't know shit about the original Eastmen and Laird vision nor have they read the early comics. These are all the people crying about their childhood being ruined.

That game got boring realllll quick, just like this movie franchise would. I'd rather not be stuck in the stone age, I enjoy change, and eventually these guys would learn from they're mistakes if it doesn't turn out good just like Godzilla. Godzilla had a tremendous change in 1998, it sucked, they learned from it, now it's 2014 and it looks like an original mixed in with new, more sophisticated awesome tech.

2014-07-17T22:52:27," I think there are reboots and there are reboots-for-the-sake-of-reboots. Take for example another reboot: Batman Begins. It really did justice to a reboot because it kept the series fresh with new ideas.  But the reason I stress that it did justice was because the fresh ideas were believable. Everything made sense in BB - the way Wayne got access to his gadgets, the reason why the Bat costume had ears, the reason why his suit had Kevlar, the way Batman has a cowl in the neck of his costume, but does away with it in the sequel, etc.  Over here, this just seems like the blueprint of the Transformers movie had sex with the blueprint of TMNT, and out came a pile of jumbled up trash. This seems like it is trying very hard to be a credible attempt at a reboot.  A real reboot, like Batman Begins, seems effortless.  This seems like they had the mandate to make a reboot first, and then brainstormed how they should reboot it, rather than a TMNT fan having a genuine epiphany of creative genius, and deciding that a reboot was in order.",0,0,PakBaluch,VZZ0PnDZdZk,0.25519972451790635,2014-07-17 22:52:27,True,True

How creepy!"" ""They EXPECT us to pay to see THIS? Who would see those ugly monsters?"" Hideous. Creepy. Ugly. Monsters.  ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO YOURSELVES? Since the very beginning, the turtles have established that they are indeed hideous creations to the human race, no matter how cartoony and cute they may have looked in the 80s, 90s, 2003 and 2012 series. To the other cartoon civilians, they were disturbing monsters, and had to hide using their ninja stealth and trenchcoats. Also, wasn't one of their BIGGEST LESSONS that they supposedly taught us as kids was that LOOKS. DO. NOT. MATTER???  I admit that I am fairly new to the franchise, and being a teenage girl I was much more drawn to their cuteness in the 2012 series. But after doing lengthy research on the franchise over the past 3 decades, from the comics up till now, I realized I didn't fall in love with their looks... but as an aspiring animator with a childlike heart, I fell in love with their unique story AND equally unique personalities. Also, they have to make difficult choices and learn lessons  through their adventures that help them grow as characters. I was mixed about it at first, but I might actually have to see this movie, even though I'm very aware it's nothing like the 2012 cartoon I currently adore. It looks much darker and more adult, but you know what? I am an adult and not a pink-and-doll-loving little girl anymore. Therefore, I think I can appreciate a good dark, adult action-comedy, if that what this turns out to be. And from the newer trailers I've seen, the turtles' personalities are VERY lively and true to the consistency of the franchise. True, they're not attractive, but this is 2014 PEOPLE. They can't look like the cuter 80s, 90s, or even 2012 cartoons if they want to get their emotions shown through facial expressions across in a live-action flick. They're not going to use cartoony puppets like the first one, because it's not DIFFERENT. Fresh and new is ESSENTIAL to any good film. The turtles have changed through SO many different interpretations over the years, and that should already be a lesson you've learned if you're over 13. Change happens. Life Happens. SERIOUSLY. I'm not even 20 yet, and I was able to figure that out. So please, people, enough with the butthurt'in and get over it. Nostalgia is a powerful emotion, I know that better than anyone. But it's just that, nostalgia. Time goes on. New memories are created. And with an open mind, you might find that the nostalgia can be found even in something like this.",0,0,Alexandra Reinert,VZZ0PnDZdZk,0.0985829274891775,2014-07-26 22:28:38,True,True

It's all about the story of this turtle jihadist converted under the name of Raphaïl al sulih'fat, who saw the light of islam after he found a funny shrimp on his pizza with spots that could be read as the shahada. He tried to convert his weaker fellow turtles, but they where too much on the path of sin, so he sliced their infidel throat during sleep (in the direction of meccah). There's a lot of humour, just like when they have to fix his carapace to make it a suicide-one, or when the imam tries to circumcise his funny turtle dick !!!  This shown here is the final scene, when Raphaïl arrives in paradise after he detonated himself in a jewish kindergarten, killing hundreds.

2014-07-31T06:18:28,"I am a massive TMNT fan having loved the cartoons, live movies, video games, etc and I'm giving this movie a chance. Here's why. Yes the Turtles are quite a bit larger than other depictions but how can we honestly say how big or small a mutated turtle should or should not be? Even if you could pinpoint it, the need for accuracy goes out the window when you're talking about mutant turtles, a slow creature, being ninjas which is a very fast fighting style. They even use their bulk to their advantage (scene where Raph smokes a vehicle). Characteristics are intact. Leo is serious, Raph aggressive, Donny shy (at least off the hop with April) and Mikey is goofy. Also the fact they were originally going to be aliens in this film but the makers scrapped that idea due to fan rage. And I believe they are hinting at Shredder playing a part in the making of the ooze which is him creating his own defeat in a way. Karma in the shape of TMNTs. April even faints at the sight of them which is also accurate (should've been Splinter but it's a pretty legit reaction to any of the characters really). Once I push all the childish and whiny nitpicks aside, my only complaint is Megan Fox as April O'Neil.

If so, there would've been a lot more action than there already was. Now, as uncanny as it was for all of us to have seen Megan Fox casted as April O'Neil (being a very typical move by Michael Bay), she was actually surprisingly decent playing this character. Because Michael Bay didn't direct it, they didn't overly sexualize her character. About the turtles, I actually thought they did a pretty awesome job at bringing out their personalities a lot more in this movie. I feel like I could really see each character for who they are. Overall Splinter could have had a little more character development but I think he was okay. Shredder on the other hand was completely over done. I think they should have stuck with the idea of him being more of a man than a man in a robotic samurai suit. That was probably the only thing I found extremely bad about the movie was Shredder's character development which I already predicted seeing this trailer. So overall I give this movie a 3 our of 5. ",0,0,Gilbert Carrizales,VZZ0PnDZdZk,0.16283333333333336,2014-12-21 12:26:26,False,False

Also the Transformers cartoon was created to sell the toys, and to this day Transformers is all this, check out the page ""To sell toys"" in the Transformers Wiki to see how the plot of all Transformers is written to sell as many toys as possible, all of you are overprotecting two long toy commercials.

Granted, it's still not quite as good as the 1990 live-action movie (which I grew up with), but for what it was, it IS enjoyable! Also, the original nicely carries that 90's vibe, whereas this version nicely carries that 2010's vibe. Both are great in their own ways. The original also follows the dark and gritty atmosphere of the comics more (while still keeping the colored bandanas of the Turtles intact), while this one follows the more lighthearted and campy atmosphere of the 1980's and 2000's cartoon shows. While this film has its faults and will never win any awards, it still succeeds at what it intends to be: a fun, action-packed popcorn flick!
