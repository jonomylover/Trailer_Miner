Sharks are not vicious towards humans by nature and don't want to harm you unless you do something to provoke them. The only reason why people get bitten is because the shark thinks you're a seal and ACCIDENTALLY bites you, or because they are tricked into thinking they are feeding by people that think its fun to attract them with bait and blood for entertainment like the people in the movie did. When sharks feed they are aggressive, but if you don't go near them while they are, you have nothing to worry about. People who provoke sharks to be aggressive and then blame them for being the aggressive ones when they accidentally bite us are really the monsters. As long as you respect their boundaries there's nothing to fear. Only 5 people die from shark attacks a year, while 100 million sharks are killed by humans a year. You are more likely to die from a lightning strike than from a shark attack, so please don't view sharks as the monsters.
