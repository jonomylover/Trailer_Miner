I was thrashing around doing my best to keep the last of the oxygen I had puffed up in my cheeks. My first thought was that I was carried out to sea. It was a huge wave. I can‚Äôt get up and I can feel myself pressed against the ocean floor. I can feel the sand on my back. Suddenly, I‚Äôm pulled up out of the water by my mom. I was in the same spot I had been in. Turns out, when the wave came, my mom grabbed my little sisters hand first, and then reached for mine, but, I was gone. As she was freaking out and looking for me (I was under water), my brother grabbed the both of them to keep them safe. The whole time, my mom and sister were STEPPING ON ME.

They‚Äôre animals, they have instincts to eat and they don‚Äôt have the largest brain or IQ which makes it difficult for them to differentiate between what is a fish/seal and a human. They‚Äôre already an endangered species and portraying them in such a light will only cast more fear on to them, making their existence one that some will happy to be rid of. Just like honey bees, we need sharks in the ecosystem. They are not  the monsters that movies portray them to be.

2019-07-17T03:06:55,"Okay but like sharks really aren‚Äôt evil y‚Äôall. Look at statistics, there‚Äôs more dog attacks in a year than there are shark attacks. It just so happens that most shark attacks wind up being lethal because you are out of your element and are no longer the alpha in the situation. There‚Äôs only around 130 attacks yearly. 66 of those attacks are ‚Äúunprovoked‚Äù which ‚Äúare defined as incidents where an attack on a live human occurs in the shark‚Äôs natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark.‚Äù Yet if a random person enters your home and you attack them, does that count as unprovoked just because you‚Äôre in your natural habitat? All shark attacks are provoked, but you can avoid provoking a shark very easily. If you‚Äôre scuba diving in non-infested or infested waters you should never wear a gray/black/blue wet suit. These are the colors of the food sharks eat. However if you wear a bright neon orange suit, in aquarium life it is common knowledge to leave you alone. Bright orange are the colors of venomous or poisonous fish, so sharks will actually tend to avoid you. If they do swim next to you, the likelihood they‚Äôll attack is very low because they know better than to eat poison. 15 of the attacks are doubtful (crying wolf) or unconfirmed.

It looks good to be honest, I think mainly because of the setting. They discovered a cave by accident after having gone deep diving in a remote location. It looks like they discovered some sort of underwater Temple where people were sacrificed thousands of years before, which I bet is going to be used later on in the movie,  some way to save themselves with the tools  or whatever . And they not only have to worry about being trapped in an underwater cave, they lose light, can get stuck, which makes it really claustrophobic for the audience, while also having to find a way out before they run out of air all while avoiding a shark that they didn't know was in there.
