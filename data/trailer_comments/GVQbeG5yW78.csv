2019-09-04T23:57:30,"You man babies (and yes some of you women too) literally hate Brie for absolutely no fucking reason, it’s irrational. Y’all know Brie doesn’t hate white dudes right? Basically if you’re familiar with the movie “A Wrinkle In Time” it didn’t do as well most of the negative reviews were by white male critics. Brie had made a statement basically saying she didn’t want to hear what some old white dude thought about the movie because it dealt more with a connection to women of color and biracial women and Brie felt they should have a better opportunity to review and criticize the movie as it hits home to them. And it’s true, a majority of critics are about 79% men and most are white and about 21% women and it’s not at all racist to call someone by what race they are...js. As for her comments about the Captain Marvel movie Brie had said she wanted there to be more diversity and seats at the table (in reference to non white men and also women), however she went on to say in that statement she wanted no seats taken away (in reference to white men). When the first Captain Marvel trailer came out a bunch of trolls kept telling her to “smile more” and Brie clapped back to that by photoshopping smiles on Marvel male leads as a clap back around the time the official trailer for Captain Marvel came out. I mean seriously though what is it with some guys and telling women to smile all the time? I mean I don’t see y’all asking the male leads to smile more...js. 🤷🏾‍♂️ And don’t say “cause she acts like she acts with no emotion” because literally the character of CM lost her memory and they said various times in the movie Carol Danvers struggled with her emotions so actually Brie played the character just right! After Brie clapped back with putting smiles on the male leads triggered trolls saw Bries statements on the Wrinkle in Time Movie as an opportunity to ruin her image and twisted her words out of context to spread the false idea that Brie hates men or more specifically white men and didn’t want them to see Captain Marvel which clearly is very much FALSE.   Regardless it doesn’t make sense for her to hate white men or men in general because she has a white father, has white male friends and family, she used to be engaged to a man who guess what? He is white! Not to mention she is currently dating a white man and works with women, white men and or men in general and not to mention she is white so that whole she’s “racist” and “sexist” towards white men or any man in general is absurd and ridiculous. She’s an introvert and is very sarcastic as a way of joking around or breaking the ice in conversation (which I understand cause I’m the same way) but y’all mistake it for her being “cocky” or “bitchy” and having “horrible personality” (Which I don’t get cause when guys are like that they’re seen as badass, laid back or mysterious...hypocritical and ironic if you ask me).  Y’all hate her personal views even though RDJ holds a lot of the same views just like almost pretty much the entire cast of the Avengers and yet y’all aren’t spouting hate at them. I mean where was your hate when Scarlett Johanson spoke at the women’s march on behalf of women being treated unfairly and constantly being sexually assaulted back in 2018?...I mean since y’all hate feminists so much. Where was your hate when RDJ said he was in full support of Iron Heart appearing in the MCU? I mean since y’all flip about female leads getting equal spotlight as the male leads. I mean like I said they share the same views as Brie and y’all like to say you don’t agree with Bries views as a reason to hate her but again I don’t see y’all hating on everyone else and don’t try to say “well she acts like a cocky know it all” as an excuse even though it’s not true not to mention RDJ and Chris H. act like cocky, sarcastic, know it alls in their interviews all the time and y’all don’t hate on them. (I love and admire Chris Hemsworth and RDJ but I’m just pointing out the double standards and bs y’all hold against Brie).   There was already a lot of pressure on Brie from the moment the first CM trailer came because Marvel was finally debuting their first female lead superhero film and y’all clearly like the women to stay in the back and let the male leads shine (figuratively speaking) I mean y’all lost your shit when the women teamed up in Endgame saying it was “forced” although it’s the exact same thing shown as with the male leads but just with women. Tbh idk what is it about Brie that y’all find so bothering but she literally gets along with everyone and anyone that has worked with her in the movies always had something positive to say about her. Not to mention yes she does get along with Chris H. they just joke around and being sarcastic with each other most of the time on who’s stronger but that’s all it is joking around and sarcasm and y’all think she hates him and make YouTube videos about it even though it’s false, even Don Cheadle (War machine) spoke out against you trolls on behalf on Brie not hating on Chris and called out you triggered trolls on Twitter for it for making negative shit up about Brie.   Still don’t like her? Oh well too bad get the fuck over yourselves cause clearly she aint bothered about y’all. I thought I shed some light on the ACTUAL FACTS over this whole hating on Brie nonsense. Say whatever negative comment you want on this I really don’t care cause it’s just bs.

After so many injustice stories, some black people start thinking that's all they'll ever get is injustice. Although it is about fighting injustice which is a good message, but it's always the same story of a black person or a group of black people facing injustice then fighting against that injustice in their nation. I just want people to see that they can be very amazing patriotic Americans who are just like the rest of us rather than people who are always getting injustice.

2020-01-08T02:37:27,"I’m from the town this entire incident took place. One of my grandparents found Ms Morrison’s body that day. I was 13 when it happened. I know the man that lied and fabricated the furniture delivery receipts that mostly tied Mr McMillian to the crime and was largely the reason he was convicted. Went to school with his daughter actually. I know the Monroeville Police Department “detectives” that mangled the crime scene up horribly. One just retired and the other is still an investigator for the DA here. I knew the DA at the time, who’s since passed away. Now I also knew several of the County Sheriff Deputy’s at the time and the ABI investigator. Funny thing is, ONLY the MPD people thought Mr McMillian was guilty. Seriously. They bungled the crime scene and destroyed it just trying to be big shots and make a name for themselves. The ABI guy was a black man and I never got to ask him his thoughts, later when I was older and better prepared to dig into this for a term paper. He was out of the area on medical or family emergency. The Sheriff’s department was made to stand down and stay away because they knew he was getting railroaded. They weren’t allowed access to the investigation so they couldn’t prove it at the time. One of the lead detectives for MCSO was a classmate’s dad and had a decade plus on the force and because he was raising so much hell about them convicting the wrong man, prior during and after the trial, a couple of attempts on his life were made. Seriously. He was forced to step down and take a job on the Reservation Police Force about 30 minutes south of here. He only shut up when both of his daughters’ lives were threatened. Then he basically just worked low key to try to help prove the State wrong.  I will also say this. For the most part, the area this happened in is very NOT racist. Hell, we were/are all too poor to be racists honestly. And that’s true of most of the South. Unfortunately, the dumb ass pieces of trash that are too ignorant to tie their shoes that are racists become more of the headlines. I went to school with several of Mr McMillian’s kids and relatives. They are some of the best people you will ever hope to meet in your life. That entire family are very humble, good hearted, extremely loving people. They’d give you the shirt off their backs and honestly didn’t have a shirt to spare. But that’s how good they are. And they are big time in the church and great Christians, if that matters to you. I know some people use religion as a crutch but this family does not. They are not hypocrites at all. Mrs McMillian has given me hugs and bandaged my booboos when I’d have a bike wreck over there playing with the other boys in the area. And too, she’s put a switch or flip flop to my ass as well. If you were in her yard playing, then you were her family and were treated like such, good or bad behavior on your part. Mr McMillian I didn’t know much because he was always working to provide for his family. I cried with one of his nieces the day he was convicted. And I cried with her and her kids when he was cleared and released. I just can’t tell or express how good these people are. And how disgustingly mean and wrong they were treated. And I hope people don’t think that all us white people in the south are the racists bigots and scum that people portray us as or think of us as. I can’t swear that’s not the case, because y’all don’t know me so it wouldn’t matter. But I hope you can actually look around and see that truthfully the dirtbags that are racists and do treat people bad, are a very small minority. Hope this movie is as good as it should be, and I love that Jamie Fox and Michael B. Jordan are playing the key roles. That alone means there’s lots of heart and love in the story. IMO. Peace and love to you all. And just love your fellow mankind. There’s no reason, justification or really energy you should waste on people that treat you bad, and a single small group shouldn’t taint your views of an entire group of people regardless of the demographic. The good shall always prevail and the bad will forever fail, no matter your race, gender, political views or sexual orientation.",0,0,Chris J Peavy,GVQbeG5yW78,0.05180480208961221,2020-01-08 02:37:27,False,True

Clint Eastwood's opinion on this film matters to me, because, like August Wilson, he is dedicated to making 'historical commentary' American films, of which this is certainly one.  I have the book, I know the stories as recounted by Mr. Bryan Stevenson Esquire, yet, seeing this 'alive' and on the big, silver screen was momentous, able to un-petrify hearts.  Every Christian, every attorney, every person on the autistic spectrum who, before we had the words 'autistic spectrum',  we referred to as 'eccentric' workaholics, and every ordinary person who loves the 'safe, civil' predictability of laws and the rule of law will have a renewed sense of optimism in civil, democratic societies where its thankfully still acceptable to obey 'the Voice' that calls many, chooses few and anoints the chosen.

2020-01-20T06:32:46,"Thought provoking, and emotionally powerful movie about social injustice, innocent people being wrongfully accused, convicted, and executed. It's hard to watch the beginning but even harder to watch the middle without crying. One of the characters, a veteran with PTSD, is on death row  instead of getting the much needed help for his traumatic experience from war which led to his mental illness/breakdown. This was something Jordan's character conveys how the system should help people like him and not brutally tear them down, brush them off from society, or especially execute them.   Michael B. Jordan should receive an award for his acclaimed performance. This was based on a true story from the 2014 memoir turned screenplay. Very hard to see how many people in power could hurt innocent human beings just for basing their hatred on their race, creed, background, or being poor. To think this took place in 1986 -1993 in the town where such a mind blowing book/movie, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was created.   Maybe it's the Catholic in me but I have always thought it's wrong to think and especially act upon the thought of being a judge/jury by taking any living human or living thing's life. I don't believe in euthanizing especially innocent human beings or animals; that is God's timing when one's life ends not ours.  I highly recommend reading the book. So grateful to see there are very few courageous people willing to fight for others til the  end; no matter what roadblocks, anger, hatred, one faces.  Loved some of the eye opening quotes: ""We can make this world a better place.""  ""We all need grace. We all need Mercy. ""  ""We are willing to stand up when people are telling us to sit down. "" (Mr. Bryan Stevenson)  It's courageous that this young Harvard lawyer had so much passion, love, intelligence, integrity, and willingness to fight for those who lost hope. Loved at the end of the film.  I believe in treating people with the respect, love, care, and especially dignity we should give to others. Always fight for those who have lost hope by giving voice to the voiceless. Very good movie to start dialogue on helping the innocent and those forgotten by society due to past mistakes.   ""Each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done. "" Love that quote because it's just so powerful in a soul searching, contemplating way. I believe it means despite the worst mistake(s) one has done in life; it shouldn't define you as a person, as a human being God intended you to be when he made you out of love. As human beings, we all aren't perfect and make mistakes we aren't proud of. That's why we are human. If one owns up to those mistakes with humility, remorse, and genuine compassion to rewrite the wrongs; that person is reborn into what we were meant to be, a good hearted person. Mr. Stevenson was right to say one's life is still valued. Life is still meaningful.  ""You're life is still meaningful. "" (B. Stevenson)",2,0,Margie Bautista,GVQbeG5yW78,0.15766005291005294,2020-01-20 06:32:46,False,True

Jordan wearing a perfectly modern suit, with a bodybuilder’s body, in a time where most men were thin and slender. The police uniform and prison uniformed looked like it was just taken out brand new and warn-no wear and tear; the casting was not good, Jordan’s acting left much to be desired, and most of the characters weren’t the archetype of that specific role. I wish that Jamie Foxx had stronger actors to support him; the picture was so bright you’d swear that they are telling a happy story.
