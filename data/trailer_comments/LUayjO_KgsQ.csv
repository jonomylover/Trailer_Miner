The nurse was reported as saying: ""She gets angry and has thrown him on the bed where he kicks his limbs or hurts himself. She allowed him to slip down low in the bath so the water goes in the hole in his throat. ""She has left him in the garden without his computer mouse so he cannot talk and call for anyone. She gives him lots of verbal abuse and calls him a cripple and an invalid, which depresses him. ""She would withhold the bottle he used to go to the toilet so he wet himself, which he does not like because he is a very dignified person and a very private person.

2015-02-24T01:23:32,"Wow people as always make a big mess from everything. If in this world is something that I distaste with all of my being that is arrogance among ignorance! We don't know shit about this Earth, nor even about our own body, and yet we think we know everything about the Universe or about existence in general! How ignorant and arrogant in the same time! The universe is incommensurable and we are sooo small, still we think we know how things were made.  Some of you are bashing on the others beliefs with no shame! Let's be clear out there, you say that the existence of God is unproven and ""God"" was created by humans in order to enslave the people physiologically and on a mental level. That the books aren't any proofs because these were created by ''the hand of human''. *But*... guess what? The scientists are human too! And the theories are human made too and most likely this'll be proven wrong again and again. Theories are just assumptions based on researches. God (in some chases) is just an assumption based on experiences of human beings trough their life. So who are you to say to the others in who or what they must believe?  If someone believe in facts then.. *it's ok*, if someone believe in what they feel then.. *it's ok* again. We don't have the right to step on what someone feels/knows/likes/dislikes/believes/approves/disapproves and so on. If someone don't force you to live in their terms then you don't force anyone else! Is that simple.  Personal I believe in one God, bigger/greater than how any religion describes Him. I feel It, I see It, I sense It, I smell It, I breath It, I touch It, I eat It every flipping day! And I don't pretend that this is ''the biggest truth'' that everyone must accept it, no! This is my truth... You have yours! Everything is perception. If you want to perceive this world as something made from matter and nothing more, fine. If you don't see the life flying all over the place, it's ok, I won't judge you. Personal I don't believe that we come out of nothing, that everything was a random effect. The cells, the atoms, the Universe, *us*, everything was so perfect programed at the finest. So, if some people finds ""God'' bs, I find ''the theory of nothing'' bs and hardly to believe. :)  But in the end I have the courage to doubt myself, what about you? :)",0,0,l EtherealHeart l,LUayjO_KgsQ,0.12851308847402598,2015-02-24 01:23:32,False,False

After reading all of Einsteins works, I read Hawking.  His only other significant book was ‘A Stubbornly Persistent Illusion’ which was a rehash of Einstein’s works.   Hawking is undoubtedly a genius but Jane was a saint whose love helped Hawking beyond his human potential…In my humble opinion…",0,0,dksmith918,LUayjO_KgsQ,0.19615384615384615,2015-02-24 20:42:30,False,False

I am going to send you a link where you can see a picture that he doesn't have any teeth kacky so all these years he had gum disease and gum disease has been eating on him and that's why he died!!!  That's why he was sick all of his life life!!! His  dentist did not cure his gum disease and just let all of his teeth rot out and which made him sick all of his life!!!   So his Dentist and Doctors could work and  some money off of his teeth and sickness all of his life!!!  Whoooo that's outrageous!!!  And is CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!! Larry Hey all of you beautiful PEOPLE OUT THERE, I WANT YOU TO NEVER EVER, EVER GET ANOTHER CAVITY OR GET SICK OR DIE OF GUM DISEASE!!! GUM DISEASE IS WHATS ON MY MIND!!! I WANT TO STOP THE DENTIST AND DOCTOR'S CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ALL AROUND THE WORLD!!!   Don't let your DENTIST, DOCTOR or GUM DISEASE SLOWLY ROB you of ALL of your TEETH your HEALTH and your LIFE!  All because they didn't cure your GUM DISEASE IN THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU FIRST GOT YOUR GUM DISEASE!!!  REAL NICE GUYS A!!! Go to YouTube and type in (cure your gum disease, periodontal disease before it kills you YES YOU)  Under this video it tells you where you can buy CLINDAMYCIN!!  It ALSO tells you what you need to know about Clindamycin!! Then type in to view the next video (is YOUR dentist ripping you off.)  Is he ever!!!  Here you will see for yourself,  FOR SURE!!  FOR SURE!!  THAT THE DENTISTS AND DOCTORS ARE OUT AND OUT RIP OFFS, THIEVES, FELONS, CRIMINALS!!  Running their SICK deadly SCAM that equals CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!! Next video is (Dr. Modovan on the Doctors Show Treating Periodontal Disease) IN THIS VIDEO THEY SAY THAT THERE ARE 65 MILLION PEOPLE WHO  HAVE GUM DISEASE AND MOST OF THEM DON’T EVEN KNOW THEY HAVE GUM DISEASE!!!  (THE QUESTION IS WHY DON’T THESE PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THIS, THE DEADLIEST DISEASE IN THE WORLD???  GUM DISEASE!!!) Its killing everyone on EARTH!!! (BECAUSE THEIR DENTIST DID NOT TELL THEM THAT THEY HAVE GUM DISEASE AND THAT WITH GUM DISEASE THEY ARE GOING START LOSING THEIR TEETH AND GET SICK AND DIE FROM IT!!!  REAL NICE GUYS!!  Also at the start of the video he said that he was told that he had EXTRA  BLEEDING!!  (THIS TELLS YOU HIS DENTIST KNEW ALL ALONG (FOR YEARS AND YEARS) THAT HIS DENTIST KNEW THAT HE HAD GUM DISEASE AND DID NOT CURE HIM WITH CLINDAMYSIN!!!  Just view the X-RAYS and you will be able to see the the major bone DAMAGE around his teeth!!!  This guy said that he brushes his teeth three times a day, flosses two times a day, goes to the dentist three times a year to have his Teeth cleaned and STILL has major damage (EVEN HAD AN ABSCESS which is DEADLY in its SELF) to his bone around his teeth (GUM DISEASE) and his dentist did not tell him that he had gum disease and his dentist KNEW for years that he had GUM DISEASE and did not tell him.  (How would the dentist know?  (SWOLLEN GUMS and x-rays)  The dentist just sat back and let the damage HAPPEN!!  So he (THE DENTIST) could make a lot of MONEY filling all of the THOSE CAVITIES etc. that you can see when he opens his mouth!!!!  If the dentist would have given him CLINDAMYCIN when his gum disease first started he would still have all of his beautiful white permanent to this very DAY!! (Here in the below video you will see what GUM DISEASE DOES TO YOUR HEART!!! GUM DISEASE IS THE (ONLY REASON) PEOPLE HAVE HEART ATTACKS AND DIE!!!) Video name is (periodontal disease can lead to HEART DISEASE) Also type in (Cure, Schizophrenia, Psychiatry, Bipolar, Psychological Disorder) ITS GUM DISEASE THAT IS CAUSING PEOPLE TO BECOME CRAZY AND NOTHING ELSE! Next Video (gum disease narrated)  Man Oh MAN, This video will explain it all, the real TRUTH about GUM DISEASE by examining an EXPLAINING the X-RAYs of someone that has a severe CASE of GUM DISEASE!!  (gum disease narrated) Must SEE video!! Next Video (gum disease)  This video, is a video of my ARTICLE that tells you HOW and WHAT I went through while I was under ATTACK of GUM DISEASE!!  You will know it's my video when it say Larry Neiderhiser. Another must see video is.  (Periodontal Disease, Heart Disease Port Rowan Care Dental)  There are lots of OTHER videos out there that tell that Gum Disease causes other diseases! LIKE HEART ATACKS!! ETC.  ETC.  ETC. If you have gum disease and don't get CURED you are FOR SURE, FOR SURE going to die Early and die a miserable death!! This will save your life!  And end the doctors and dentist SCAM of not CURING YOU OF GUM DISEASE AND NOT telling you about gum disease and how deadly it is!! Look out!! GUM DISEASE, (PERIODONTAL DISEASE) is GOING TO KILL YOU if not cured!!  For Sure, FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!!! Your dentist is a crook just like the rest of the dentists!  If he did not GIVE YOU CLINDAMYSIN TO CURE YOUR GUM DISEASE HE IS JUST LETTING THE GUM DISEASE BACTERIA EAT YOU UP !!",0,0,Larry Neiderhiser,LUayjO_KgsQ,0.048589132918792514,2018-07-05 19:16:09,False,False
2018-07-08T18:42:15,"Just look at his MISSING TEETH!!! ONLY FOUR LEFT!!! Yah!!!  Stephen Hawking was a BRAIN ALL RIGHT!!! Just think of the many more things he would have figured out if only his DENTIST and DOCTORS WOULD HAVE SEEN THOSE SWOLEN, STINKING BLEEDING, RED GUMS OF HIS OVER AT LEAST FIFTY YEARS !!  (I'll bet his wife did!!)  Yes, here again.  Thinking of his dentist!!! Every time his dentist met with Stephen TO GRIND, PULL, CAP, BRIDGE, ROOT CANALS, ETC., ETC!!! he had his plastic glove on and KNOW DOUBT had his mast on also!!!  His dentist was protecting him self from Stephen.  His dentist knows how deadly that bacteria was in Stephens mouth!!! And thats why his dentist was protecting himself!!! But think of this, HIS DENTIST THOUGHT it was alright for Stephen to go home and kiss his petty wife and kids WITH ALL THAT DEADLY, STINKING BACTERIA IN HIS MOUTH THAT WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO HIS PERTY WIFE AND CHILDREN!!! Man OH MAN  these people ARE low down Skum Bags.  All of this MISERY just because HIS DENTIST DID SEE ANY REASON TO CURE STEPHEN OF HIS GUM DISEASE!!!  EVEN WHEN HIS DENTIST COULD PLAINLY SEE ALL OF THOSE TEETH FALLING OUT OF STEPHEN MOUTH  BY THE HANDS FULL!!!  WHY DIDN'T HIS DENTIST CURE HIS GUM DISEASE!!!  EVEN BEFORE HE GOT LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE.  HIS DENTIST SHOULD HAVE PREVENTED STEPHEN'S GUM DISEASE  OR AT LEAST AT THE FIRST SIGN OF GUM DISEASE SHOULD HAVE CURED HIS GUM DISEASE!!!  SO HERE IT IS!!!  THIS IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW!!!  THE BUCK STOPS HERE!   Food gets under the gums!!!  Bacteria eats the food!!!  The bacteria POOP.  This POOP is called lactic Acid.  As this acid progresses not only does it rot out your teeth it infames the gums.  This give THE DEADLY, STINKING BACTERA a direct path into your blood stream!!! NOW, not only is it eating the FOOD under your gums and ruining (ROTTING) ALL OF your teeth OUT!!! Its now ALIVE EATING AND POOPING in your WHOLE body from head to toe!!!   And doing the same thing to your whole body!!!  With Gum disease BACTERA you never know how its going to effect your body first!!!  For some people it causes cancer!!! Then, with someone else it causes you to go crazy!!! ETC., ETC.!!!  Now with Stephen it was Lou Gehrig's Disease.  What I am saying here is, it was his dentist and doctors FAULT FOR STEPHEN LONG MISERABLE SICK LIFE!!!  IT WAS HIS DENTIST AND DOCTORS FAULT FOR STEPHEN DYING. YOU SEE HIS DENTIST AND DOCTORS DID EVERYTHING THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE!!!  (GRINDING, PULLING, CAPING, BRIDGEING, ROOT CANALS, ETC., ETC!)  AND NOT THE ONE THING AND ONLY THING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE!!!  THIS ONE THING IS, THEY SHOULD HAVE CURED HIS GUM DISEASE!!!  WHICH MEANS ALL OF THE ABOVE WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED TO STEPHEN!!! ( WHICH MEANS THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN STEPHEN FORTY DOLLARS OF CLINDAMYCIN THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED ALL OF THAT STINKING,  DEADLY BACTERIA THAT WAS CAUSING HIS SWOLLEN GUMS, BLEEDING GUMS, ROTTING OUT ALL OF HIS TEETH, INFECTING HIS WHOLE BODY CAUSING STEPHEN TO BE SICK ALL OF HIS LIFE AND FINALLY KILLING STEPHEN!!!  HIS DENTIST AND DOCTORS SHOULD GET THEIR RIGHTFUL REWARD!!! AND BE TRIED FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!!  Have you heard the song???  Bad DENTIST AND DOCTOR, BAD DENTIST AND DOCTOR, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHEN THEY COME FOR YOU???  TO TRY YOU OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY FOR WHAT YOU DID TO STEPHEN!!!  AND TO MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD JUST LIKE STEPHEN!!!  VIEW MY YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND SAVE YOUR TEETH, HEALTH AND LIFE!!! IT SAVED MY LIFE!!! Hey all of you beautiful PEOPLE OUT THERE, I WANT YOU TO NEVER EVER, EVER GET ANOTHER CAVITY OR GET SICK OR DIE OF GUM DISEASE!!! GUM DISEASE IS WHATS ON MY MIND!!! I WANT TO STOP THE DENTIST AND DOCTOR'S CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY% ALL AROUND THE WORLD!!!   Don't let your DENTIST, DOCTOR or GUM DISEASE SLOWLY ROB you of ALL of your TEETH your HEALTH and your LIFE!  All because they didn't cure your GUM DISEASE IN THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU FIRST GOT YOUR GUM DISEASE!!!  REAL NICE GUYS A!!! Go to YouTube and type in (cure your gum disease, periodontal disease before it kills you YES YOU)  Under this video it tells you where you can buy CLINDAMYCIN!!  It ALSO tells you what you need to know about Clindamycin!! Then type in to view the next video (is YOUR dentist ripping you off.)  Is he ever!!!  Here you will see for yourself,  FOR SURE!!  FOR SURE!!  THAT THE DENTISTS AND DOCTORS ARE OUT AND OUT RIP OFFS, THIEVES, FELONS, CRIMINALS!!  Running their SICK deadly SCAM that equals CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!! Next video is (Dr. Modovan on the Doctors Show Treating Periodontal Disease) IN THIS VIDEO THEY SAY THAT THERE ARE 65 MILLION PEOPLE WHO  HAVE GUM DISEASE AND MOST OF THEM DON’T EVEN KNOW THEY HAVE GUM DISEASE!!!  (THE QUESTION IS WHY DON’T THESE PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THIS, THE DEADLIEST DISEASE IN THE WORLD???  GUM DISEASE!!!) Its killing everyone on EARTH!!! (BECAUSE THEIR DENTIST DID NOT TELL THEM THAT THEY HAVE GUM DISEASE AND THAT WITH GUM DISEASE THEY ARE GOING START LOSING THEIR TEETH AND GET SICK AND DIE FROM IT!!!  REAL NICE GUYS!!  Also at the start of the video he said that he was told that he had EXTRA  BLEEDING!!  (THIS TELLS YOU HIS DENTIST KNEW ALL ALONG (FOR YEARS AND YEARS) THAT HIS DENTIST KNEW THAT HE HAD GUM DISEASE AND DID NOT CURE HIM WITH CLINDAMYSIN!!!  Just view the X-RAYS and you will be able to see the the major bone DAMAGE around his teeth!!!  This guy said that he brushes his teeth three times a day, flosses two times a day, goes to the dentist three times a year to have his Teeth cleaned and STILL has major damage (EVEN HAD AN ABSCESS which is DEADLY in its SELF) to his bone around his teeth (GUM DISEASE) and his dentist did not tell him that he had gum disease and his dentist KNEW for years that he had GUM DISEASE and did not tell him.  (How would the dentist know?  (SWOLLEN GUMS and x-rays)  The dentist just sat back and let the damage HAPPEN!!  So he (THE DENTIST) could make a lot of MONEY filling all of the THOSE CAVITIES etc. that you can see when he opens his mouth!!!!  If the dentist would have given him CLINDAMYCIN when his gum disease first started he would still have all of his beautiful white permanent to this very DAY!! (Here in the below video you will see what GUM DISEASE DOES TO YOUR HEART!!! GUM DISEASE IS THE (ONLY REASON) PEOPLE HAVE HEART ATTACKS AND DIE!!!) Video name is (periodontal disease can lead to HEART DISEASE) Also type in (Cure, Schizophrenia, Psychiatry, Bipolar, Psychological Disorder) ITS GUM DISEASE THAT IS CAUSING PEOPLE TO BECOME CRAZY AND NOTHING ELSE! Next Video (gum disease narrated)  Man Oh MAN, This video will explain it all, the real TRUTH about GUM DISEASE by examining an EXPLAINING the X-RAYs of someone that has a severe CASE of GUM DISEASE!!  (gum disease narrated) Must SEE video!! Next Video (gum disease)  This video, is a video of my ARTICLE that tells you HOW and WHAT I went through while I was under ATTACK of GUM DISEASE!!  You will know it's my video when it say Larry Neiderhiser. Another must see video is.  (Periodontal Disease, Heart Disease Port Rowan Care Dental)  There are lots of OTHER videos out there that tell that Gum Disease causes other diseases! LIKE HEART ATACKS!! ETC.  ETC.  ETC. If you have gum disease and don't get CURED you are FOR SURE, FOR SURE going to die Early and die a miserable death!! This will save your life!  And end the doctors and dentist SCAM of not CURING YOU OF GUM DISEASE AND NOT telling you about gum disease and how deadly it is!! Look out!! GUM DISEASE, (PERIODONTAL DISEASE) is GOING TO KILL YOU if not cured!!  For Sure, FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!!! Your dentist is a crook just like the rest of the dentists!  If he did not GIVE YOU CLINDAMYSIN TO CURE YOUR GUM DISEASE HE IS JUST LETTING THE GUM DISEASE BACTERIA EAT YOU UP !! Let me ask all of you beautiful people A COUPLE OF  QUESTIONS!!!  WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS???  ARE YOU GOING TO LET THESE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY GO ON AND ON FOREVER AND EVER.  OR ARE WE GOING TO COME TOGETHER, ORGANIZE AND GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT GUM DISEASE AND STOP THE MISERY FOR EVER?????????????",1,0,Larry Neiderhiser,LUayjO_KgsQ,0.030410579584055398,2018-07-08 18:42:15,False,False
