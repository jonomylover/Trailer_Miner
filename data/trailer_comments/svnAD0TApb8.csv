2017-03-01T03:05:08,"Hopefully it's just the trailer but, having the alien be CGI most of the time makes me feel a bit detached from the idea that there's really 'something threatening and scary standing there!'. It's possible they've gone the path the original Jurassic Park did; for a 2 hour movie it only had around 5 minutes total in CGI, Steven Spielberg in his prime- and that holds up well even today, a quarter of a century later. John Carpenters 'The Thing' beats the new cgi filled 'The Thing' any day (although I enjoy latter still). Hell even Ridley himself did the film that started all this with no CGI right? Followed by James Camerons Aliens with little CGI. So hopefully a lot of Xeno scens are done practically as well as CGI. I'm not against the use of CGI at all, I think CGI is fantastic in modern films, for background crowds, environments, buildings, vehicles, water, explosions, everything but living breathing creatures when they are the focus. The moment a CGI villain pops onto the scene all suspension of disbelief is out the window, for me personally.  However, it's good to see a Xenomorph again after the severe lack of them in Prometheus. I'm glad Ridley went against his own judgement the first time around and listened to the franchise's fans chanting 'MORE ALIEN!!!'. Big, Bald, Buff generic looking pale white man aliens as the 'Engineers of Mankind' is great and all, but nightmare fuelled horrific Xenomorphs hands down beats that. No debate.

2017-03-01T05:42:51,"I can't for the life of me understand why people are complaining about the CGI? The movie as a whole looks fantastic aesthetically. I personally like Ridley Scott's use of a cgi and practical mix, like he did in Prometheus. You get the best of both worlds. I love practically effects but the cgi is in no way bad looking, especially considering they're probably still touching it up since we're 2 months out from release. I've also seen comments talking about missing barely seeing the alien because it's scarier that way but people forget that it was scary back then because no one knew what the thing really looked like. This is the 6th movie we all know what a xenomorph looks like at this point. Suspense comes from situations too, not just mystery. We all know what the girl from the ring looked like but that was still scary because of what happened in the movie.

The alien is a mystery, you can't kill it or else that generates a whole new level of issues (acid blood), so the point is to escape. That sense of claustrophobia being in space and all was great and this movie has some pointing to that, however where this movie seems to fall flat is the other aspect (and more important aspect) of why the xenomorph is scary. It blends in. It's an odd mystery that you want to see but when in its element practically invisible due to its surroundings and that sense of uncertainty was what made the film so uncomfortable and brilliant. This one there's no mystery, you see the threat running at you and it's a lot less scary to run from something you see than hide from something that may be behind you.",219,41,Reed Oka-MacLaren,svnAD0TApb8,0.02121212121212121,2017-03-01 06:01:09,True,True

2017-03-01T09:15:41,"So let's break down the new kinds of aliens here and theories.  At the end of Prometheus, you saw the Engineer meld with  that weird giant squid alien thing, a giant facehugger mother, technically.  Then, the result was a Deacon.  That probably happened on this planet too, and that Deacon found life to harvest from and hatching  from, evolving more, to what I assume is the Neomorph (the tan alien), the first form with the tail and striking features.    Then, the alien at the end is a Protomorph (pretty freakin' terrifying too), the last evolution before the Xenomorph (it's ""perfect"" evolution), which is the result of hatching from a human.  As for the black skin, I assume it had something to do with one of the crew members inhaling the black spores/goo, mixing with the alien that hatches from inside of them, therefore giving it a black skin pigment, is my guess.    They put that there as a clue, for a reason.  I'm guessing that's the reason, but as to what else the spores do, it's probably not good for a human, it's very possible that it's related to the black goo drink from the beginning of Prometheus, maybe, or something else entirely.  But, to see the origin of these creatures, from Prometheus, to this, is quite exciting.  I also like how they're focusing on characters more too, like the original Alien.  This maybe the last Alien prequel, and who knows if Alien 5 will happen, but I pray it does, to wrap things up.

Most of the scenes with an actual xenomorph will probably happen within the last half hour of the film. A film which will probably go on for two and a half hours. That pale small and shitty CGId alien we see in this trailer will probably be the main antagonist of most of the film as the previous trailer was very much dedicated to focusing on that crawling out of that dudes back.

Considering their form of sight is this kind of radial omnipotence where they can see whatever's around their general area. So if it uses eye sight instead it could possibly be less of a threat but more in some ways? I'm personally thinking about this in terms of ""what if this thing was put into Alien: Isolation and how would it search for me?""

2017-03-01T10:12:57,"One thing I've come to terms with is that people spend a lot of their free opinion to complain. I prefer to complain about those who complain.  Prometheus was disappointing, and this movie seems to deliver what a lot of people originally wanted from Prometheus. It can't be the first movie because the first movie already did that. Who wants to see a sequel that's too much like it's predecessor? That's just boring.  The CGI, while evident, is a necessity. Puppets, animatronics, and people in suits would've given a more immersive appearance, but people have to be realistic. It costs a lot more doing purely that, and it would also be limiting. And for all that we know, who knows to what exact extent Scott has chosen to present the alien? These may very well just be the scenes where a CGI-model is the most necessary. And who says that we won't forget it's a model?

First off, the CGI looks fine. IT IS NOT PERFECT AND NOT TERRIBLE, just good. There's some nice detail to it. I would understand if the CGI was terrible, but it isn't. In fact, it is not distracting at all.  Second, just pointing it out because it is there means you have a very low attention span. And that's no good. I it'll never be as good as Alien or Aliens, but it's just a fun little movie (I hope) that is just a prequel to the series.  Third, CGI doesn't determine the quality of the movie. Character development and story does.  So to conclude, if you can't or won't appreciate good CGI, then don't go and see this film and don't go complaining in the comment section about it.

The original Alien had more psychological suspense, which really worked well with the setting.  It built up to a terrifying crescendo....  To me, Alien is about the dark, foreboding mood, interspersed with a bit of action, but it's the anticipatory non-action, that really made the first movie a standout film, both in it's cinematography, as well as in it's story-telling.

As aliens was a perfect sequel expanding on the universe and introducing more characters and aliens straying a bit from horror to thriller action but it was still scary. This movie to me feels like a combination of those 2. with action, horror, and some very very very nice CGI. the film genre is all about evolution and something that shows the alien perfectly is seeing how it can now be portrayed onto the big screen while being able to show more of it than ever because of how creative directors can be BECAUSE they don't have to rely on props they can truly branch out and give people a very good looking alien. I can say 100% that I am excited for this film BUT am still ever so slightly scared because of how my watch of Prometheus went. good movie...but not what they promised.",0,0,infamous PSYCHO,svnAD0TApb8,0.2676388888888889,2017-03-01 12:20:03,True,True

Hinting that maybe there was a completely different purpose for the Xenomorph's that we weren't aware off. Maybe humans where made on a whim as slave race for an ancient colony on Earth, later along the line they had some sort of war with other extraterrestrial creatures and they created the Xenomorph's as bio-weapons to use against them, and they where going to unleash them on Earth as means of test and manufacturing before they would take their monstrosities from Earth to be used for their war?

Why did they REALLY want to infect all of earth or wipe us humans out.  Were we just another seeded planet that failed?  Did we grow too advanced for their liking?  Or was our whole purpose just to be hosts for their xenomorph weapon.  Were they trying to contain a failed experiment (xenomorph)?  We don't want another Alien-focused movie.

It wasnt the best movie, but the groundwork it laid could have led to something special. Instead it looks like the same old story. It looks like some elements made it into this movie. The ship, David, wheat. I just didnt see any sign of the engineers, which were genius because with them you have the ability to introduce a number of new species. It also created a great backstory connecting humans directly to the Aliens. It will be a shame if this movie doesnt explain anything and  ends up being a remake with 1 or 2 extra forms of Alien.

There's a lot for you guys! Ridley Scott himself has said he doesn't like to tread on familiar ground, he likes to move forward! So most likely the xenomorph we see here isn't much of a focus in the film, only an obstacle at one point, most likely not even near the end. He also said this film WILL answer the question ""Why did the Engineers want to destroy Earth?"" and that this film will focus on the theme of immortality.  -GENRE: a thriller/horror/action mix, just like Prometheus.  I don't understand the whining about this trailer. It's going in the best direction for everyone! Some people are even whining about plotholes already. Really? You analyze something that isn't even there yet!? The only issue I find is the CGI of the xeno at the end, it should be better, and hopefully it will be, they still have months to perfect it.

And by basic story, I of course mean they find an Alien(s), get infected, fight it/them, and end up with one survivor. How do I figure? Predator 2 had the same basic story of Predator, yet Predator 2 was definitely a good movie. In both movies the basic story is there's a big conflict, and in the middle of it, the Predator shows up and starts killing people, before the protagonist, both even being part of the armed forces, faces him and ends up killing him. Predator 2 wasn't as good as the first, and it was far from a masterpiece, but it was still memorable and enjoyable. If those movies both had the same story and both were good, then I believe this has the potential of reusing the same story as the original and still being good; so long as they mix it up a bit, much like they did with Predator 2 (The transition from jungle to city for example).

2017-03-12T05:02:15,"The way just keep on recycling the female protagonist over and over and over, in the very first film ripley was just lucky to be the last one left. In Aliens her experience gave her the survival edge. In Alien¬≥ neither luck or experience helped. But every film since they've pushed this macho woman image and men as sissy and incompetent.   Alien resurrection ripley was like a super woman crushing balls, AvP the chick was super smart and all the men were one dimensionally flawed and or stupid. AvP2 brought the balance back a little but Prometheus was full of beta cucks with Charlise Theron and Noomy Rapace the only ones with desperation and steel in the moment. Aliens is my favourite film of all time along with the first Terminator and Predator. But what made Terminator and Aliens so good to watch was the vunerabily of those girls that they were in mortal danger. Nowadays as soon as you identify the female protagonist you she's not in any danger cause she's not afraid and way smarter than the aliens and that just takes away the thrill of when you don't know who's gonna make it. But that gets lost on film writers these days where they have a 'proven' formula.

Like an apex species, they had little fear.The Engineers stumbled across the Predator species... but the predators are a ruthless species, only interested in supremacy through violence. The Engineers represented a new challenge to them, and an interstellar war began... A war that the Engineers were ill-equipped and not ready for - separated from conflict for millennia, they had been able to turn their focus to other things. Their technical and scientific achievements were unmatched. But faced with the fanatical ferocity of the Predator species - who would kill at all cost - they found themselves beaten back. They put safeguards in place so the Predators couldn't use their technology - the flutes that initialized their systems were specifically designed for that purpose. The Predators invented technology to help them mimic the sounds of other life forms for that very reason... as a work around.So they turned to the one thing they did best - genetic engineering; and created a weapon that not even the Predators would be able to deal with... and that only the Engineers held the kill switch for. Or, at least that was the assumption. But the Predators adapted too fast. Fighting a war on two fronts, and loving every second of it. The Engineers sent a strike force to their military outpost that housed their last resort - the doomsday ships loaded with ""black goo"" weaponry; but an accident stopped them just before launch. The Predators defeated the Engineers and subjugated the new Alien species - placing it at the pinnacle of their predatory achievements... ushering in two millennia of new hunting culture, where they used the Aliens on many worlds as a test of their prowess. The last Engineer was awoken by the Prometheus expedition; and realizing what had happened, attempted to carry out the doomsday attack - but failed. This could have been a rogue element in the Engineer society; and they could still exist... but that seems unlikely... as coexistence with the Predator species would be impossible.",0,0,Dario stud,svnAD0TApb8,0.009836265884652971,2017-03-17 17:47:02,True,True

The shots look stunning, but the format seems off. I'm all for digital film cameras enabling low budget film makers to do some amazing things. Or, top draw directors like I√±√°rritu to shoot jaw dropping films like The Revenant for months in the wild. Ridley Scott, however, does not do low budget and will have shot a lot of this in the studio. He can afford film.   As Nolan suggested in an interview recently, cinema needs to differentiate itself from the streaming platforms to survive. Film is the way to do that, as there is no denying it is the superior choice visually, if financially viable. A blockbuster like this certainly qualifies.     Ridley used the digital Red Dragon camera in Prometheus which looked better. The Arri Alexa used in this doesn't look like it has stood up to that having seen this trailer, and I do think it's a bit of a shame.

2017-05-05T19:30:40,"Why I am excited: I have been a fan of the Alien franchise since I was a kid (my parents were cool) particularly the first Alien and 'Aliens'. Whilst I enjoyed prometheus it was frustrating how they left out key scenes that would have made the plot clearer, especially for casual viewers. A direct prologue, however, would provide an opportunity to develop from this and create something that could revolutionise the Alien universe and, from the trailer, it would seem that a lot of the structure stays loyal to the original films.   Why I am sceptical: from what they have shown (which I feel is too much - I don't want to see the Xenomorph in the trailer nor do I want to see who gets their face mounted first - cmon guys stop spoiling things) it almost seems like you can predict the plot immediately. I'm guessing the structure will go as follows: A mission to colonise an alien planet with willing participants, a calm but unsettling adjustment process where the more they discover the more they don't like, a character being developed (either cyborg or a key crew member) as mysterious or untrustworthy, the discovery of the ship shown and subsequently exposure to the Alien, a drawn out learning curve where the new characters learn what we all already know about the Xenomorph, several character deaths, a 'twist' which will most likely be the discovery that this mission was intentionally made for either surveillance, scientific curiosity or acquisition of a Xenomorph, the realisation that someone knew all along and then, finally, the surviving protagonists attempting to escape/combat the traitor with an alien on the loose. I also reckon they may have the antagonist survive as they would need such information on the Xenomorph if the first Alien was to make sense (they wouldn't send the ship out without some prior knowledge of the specimen). Who knows I could be wrong, maybe they go with something completely different but that also brings complications.",0,0,Creative Characters,svnAD0TApb8,0.040700965700965694,2017-05-05 19:30:40,True,True

I still enjoyed Aliens, and hell, even Prometheus, and I'm gonna see this cause I'm too fascinated by the franchise not to, but it feels like at some point along the way they lost all understanding of what they wanted to do and what stories they wanted to tell. That's why the original Alien will forever be my favorite out of all of these, because even though it had a simple enough premise, it knew what it wanted to be, it was hauntingly scary and beautifully executed with the limited resources of that time.

So I was disappointed because this movie kept being advertised as pure horror but it is not that. Do not go see this movie expecting to be scared and horrified. That's my recommendation to adjust your expectations and not be disappointed like I was. The video game Alien Isolation is much scarier than this movie.

Borrowing too heavily from both and therefore the tension of the first film and action of the second is diluted as the viewer knows what to expect. However i rate this as a worthy chapter in the Alien saga. Perhaps a little too nostalgic, with little new to say. Stand alone an impressive film to any newcomer to the series. Recommended to that end. Speaking as a veteran fan however, i would suggest, like its hallowed predecessors mentioned above, the franchise needs to decide if its making one kind of story or another. Attempts to please everyone always fail. Give us distinct chapters to this nightmare tale. Not a hodge podge. Also stronger lead actors please. The actor playing synthetics was excellent, but the actors playing humans were weak.  Merely mimicking the iconic characters of original two films. Perhaps they were constrained by the script.  I found as viewer i didnt care for their fate in the way i had that of the character ""Ripley"" played by the incomparable Sigourney Weaver. Because they were mostly pale shadows of the original characters played by lesser actors trying to be like the original actors. We need new characters played by memorable actors please. Otherwise i commend this addition to the ""Alien"" saga. Post script there are minor details i havent touched on that need improvement, but i havnt the time to go into that now.

There was a sense of fear in not knowing what exactly was lurking in the shadows. In this film, that entire aspect was taken away by having the alien out in the daylight.

2017-08-11T21:13:21,"We have to remember that this is intended to be a horror movie, not a science fiction flick -- just as the first Alien movie was a monster movie and not much else.  I'd like to see an alien science fiction film, but then most viewers and critics would probably consider it boring.  You still have people who only recently watched 2001: A Space Odyssey and left remarks that they didn't understand it and were bored -- and thus goes any possible serious science-based film that we may ever witness.  Whatever happened to Rendezvous with Rama?  Whatever happened to Asimov's Foundation?  Whatever happened with 98% of great science fiction?    Well, if scripts ever got written for any of this material, they are yellowing and disintegrating along with any interest in seeing real science fiction ideas brought to the screen.  Why?  I think you can guess.  The modern audience has the attention span of a fruit fly.  They want their visit to the cinema to be like a roller coaster ride, not a mind trip.  They don't want to use their minds.  To the contrary, they pay their ticket to leave their minds somewhere near the concession stand.  Their minds are used to add flavor to the popcorn.    The entire Alien franchise is a horror franchise, not one based in science fiction.  Ridley Scott and others don't really care about making authentic films that make any sense.  He is in it for the bucks, and that means creating thrills.  And now he is capitalizing on a decades old horror flick.    What we are all quietly yearning for is a well-made science fiction film -- not a horror/monster movie set sometime in the future.  I think many of us are thirsty for something that cannot be swallowed in one gulp -- something we have to chew on and digest slowly, diligently.  I'm not speaking for the vast majority of moviegoers, but those few of us that are able to make a distinction between horror and sci fi and hunger for something more than the horror genre can deliver.

Some comments that I'm reading some are saying the movies good other saying it's bad. Rotten Tomatoes I think they're giving it like a 72%so I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. Other people I talk to saying it's not worth it buying a new alien movie. But if it did that bad then why did it make 232.6 million dollars give or take I can't exactly remember for sure somewhere around there and need that much in the movie theaters. I don't know however I still am a big alien fans even though Sigourney Weaver snot in a newer ones. And I know she's never going to be in anyone's anymore that's okay it's all good I understand. She's getting too old to be doing these movies anymore that happens. Anyway there's two movies I would love for them to do in CGI a alien colonial Marines or a aliens isolation. You know how they did the other two movies in CGI Resident Evil degeneration and Resident Evil damnation. Anyway back to alien new movie so just wondering if this is really worth buying or not I can't decide or make up my mind. From what the trailers I seen so far it looks good so far but the trailers I had watched on television or I should say the commercials for it don't look all that great. The trailers on YouTube for the new alien movie much better than the commercials television when they show it on there I don't know.,0,0,shawn eldridge,svnAD0TApb8,0.04725572047000619,2017-08-14 22:11:08,False,True

Horror movies make a TON of money, because they get made on incredibly low budgets of 10 to 15 million when compared to covenants 150+ million. The genre is too niche for budgets that high. No more spanning vistas or giant set pieces, as gorgeous as they are. My proposed idea If they were to do a Covenant sequel would be to keep the movie ON the Covenant, just like the original spent almost the entire movie on one ship. Hear me out. The ship is relatively large, it has 2000 colonists on it, a rogue synthetic and at least 2 aliens. We saw during covenant that the Alien was somewhat disobedient when it tried to attack David through the monitor, so have something go wrong during one of his experiments and have the two (or possibly more) aliens break free and cause havoc.

The ""creators"" distributed humanoids on different planets where there was a need to interfere in atmospheric conditions (in the case of people, biblical catastrophes, floods, etc.). The prometheus' humanoids developed the most and reached the creators, curious engineers destroyed their ""Gods"" and took over their name (does not it remind something?). If they saw competition in other ""humanoids"" - they destroyed them (they saw it in people), while the less developed ones that they saw in the gods left alive (engineers from covenat). Just history is coming round. It's nice if Ridley used something, I hope that at least he can do one movie and close the buckle, these two films may gain on continuation. Then move the action 500 years into the future (in the end of the prequels leave an open gate - there are more spaces after the egg galaxy), completely ""detach"" from previous movies and just do a two-hour closed story, not some new trilogies, only different films, various director's visions, different interpretations with strangers in the background. Recently there have been rumors about the show, or some short films there - this is a good track, there will be a lot of younger creators with their interesting ideas, but Scott must also finish what he started, you can not leave it.

It looks like Mr Scott wanted to go back to the original alien movie and rehash the same storyline.  Except he only directed the movie, he did not write the original movie.  The crew are total morons for suddenly wanting to go to the planet with the beacon.  They couldve just called it in and let another expedition go. Why risk the lives of thousands of colonists?  He little alien creatures are way too fast and strong.  Unable to even kill them with the guns.  The idea of spores infecting them is stupid.  The spores turned into little aliens which eat you from the inside?  Stick with the alien lore.....It's the facehuggers from the ,as He eggs that infect you.  There's too much contradicting  bullshit that makes this movie hard to watch.   At least have a nice nude scene with some boobies, but even that they messed up.  The lead female protagonist is not attractive at all, she looks like a lesbian.  There are couples whose names elude me and I didn't care if they got killed.  It looks like a Friday the thirteenth movie where the couples get killed one by one by Jason.  Only thing is the great special effects but that could redeem the movie.  The stupidest thing is they killed off Shaw which was beginning to have a good story arc.  Much like what happened in alien 3 where they killed off newt and hicks in the beginning of the movie.

2019-04-03T19:13:31,"I am 40 years old... Yes a dinosaur according to the internet standards of age i am sure. However i can share my views as a fan., I was first introduced to the alien cinematic universe when i was 11 years old. I was at home.. It was a Sunday. I had trampled back from my grandparents who lived across the street from us in a small North European village where people lived 200 meters from each other. A very lonely desolate place. My father had recorded ""ALIEN"" on VHS the night before from Tv.... Back when you had ""Snowy reception and an analog antenna on the roof"".  And i was so eager to watch it since science and fiction really was my interest and still is. Home alone at 11 years old. I knew about Stars Wars at that time already with all the fantasies and peow peow darth vader characters and toys and whatever. .......  But OMG... When i hit that play button and remember hearing that channel voice caster at that time on the channel saying ""Now we are going to show you a movie of which maybe you will feel better with someone near you or holding a hands with you because this is ""ALIEN - The Eight Passenger"". A tale of an alien organism that spreads death and devastation on board the Spaceship ""Nostromo"".   I was like aha.. Whatever, intriguing. But what the fuck was i watching?... From the first moment of those two helmets and computer talking ... to landing on Acheron.. It was being transported to a whole other world. Smh... Long story short... The whole scenes when they went into that derelict spacecraft with the jockey was good... But it was not until they cut open Kanes helmet and i saw that thing on his face ""face hugger"" i had the feeling of... Am i watching a movie or a documentary?!.. The realities got blended in that moment.. Like What the fuck am i watching and taking part of?!.. Something truly wonderful in cinematic history and yet so depraved and horrifying.   And that is my point! These two movies... Both Prometheus and Alien Covenant.. That wanted to be prequels or whatever the hell they wanted to be.. They were so many production fingers in them... Script was altered 10+ times and not to mention... Designs and shit used again from HR Gigers Jodorovsky DUNE adaptation with the dome..  It was a chance for the Alien Franchise to get rebooted. From the horrible... horrible Alien Vs Predator movies in earlier years! Yet they managed to fuck it, still they had HR Giger on board for the first one (Prometheus)! They made it into a fucking joke and a wasted potential.   Here is a bucket.. We tape ""Alien Prequel"" too it.. Take a shit in it and film our shit. The alien dorks will still pay to see it because they are obsessed with the franchise so anything goes. And you did. You got fucked over. Twice!    If you are a person that has seen the first Alien film which these two are based upon and you think these two films are good as prequels? Then you need to fucking check yourself and you can fill up my ass with your bullshit! Rubbish, Garbage! This is like writing by fucking dummies that only cares to milk your sorry ass for money. The Alien franchise is dead and thank god for that! The Space Jockey bursting alien in ""Prometheus"" is still running around on ""LV-Who Cares"".. And there will be no solution to it. Never. Unless in those comic books where it was said that it became part of the planet so the alien was the planet. Yeah film that shit.

Added to the pain and suffering, was the gruesome infliction meted to them by some horrible monster creatures. These entities poked them furiously and ferociously with sharp spears. The demons mocked, blamed and accused them of all their wrongs (of having lied, deceived, stolen, hated, boasted, cheated, envied, fornicated, murdered, slandered and mocked others) while they were alive on earth. They were reminded that they failed to repent, failed to stop sinning and failed to seek for forgiveness and salvation from Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, who loved¬† all people, and paid for the wrongs of everyone with His own blood on the cross, in order to save everyone, and to give the kingdom of heaven to anyone who seeks it.

2019-10-01T10:29:45,"Ok. Where do I even fucking begin with Alien Covenant...    First off. Fuck this movie up it's acid stained cum coated ass. Now that I have said that? I feel better already. But I am far from done with tearing this movie to fucking pieces.    This film was shockingly stupefyingly horrible on nearly every level a film could possibly suck. The direction sucked, the writing was stupid and downright insulting, the acting was either bland, awful or tolerable at best, the score is simply just a xerox copy of Goldsmith's score from Alien, the visual effects at times look laughably bad, and the scenes with the aliens all came across as direct to video slasher director's idea of what a Xenomorph sequence should be. And were all woefully inept and devoid of any sense of suspense or terror. They were like multiple chickens running around with their heads cut off. Absolutely no subtlety.    This film is so terrible it makes the previous films in the franchise all look like masterpieces in comparison. And I mean that. Even Prometheus was better than this shit. That at least had some genuinely impressive visuals. This doesn't even manage to bring that to the table. The visuals in this are all bland and completely unimpressive.    It lacks the likable and charismatic characters that a film like Alien had to help make the film suspenseful and entertaining. Any characters that show any promise get fucked in the end anyway because of the film's head to the desk stupid twist ending, and even the ones I liked get jack shit to do for most of the movie anyway.    The writing is some of the worst I have ever seen in my life. It manages to carry over the sheer stupidity of the previous film and knock off even more IQ points in the process. For a film that has Alien in the title there sure isn't a lot of Alien in the fucking film. What is there is paltry and pathetic at best. It's just a bloody mess. Literally.    And for a film that opens up with such a pretentious prologue it sure is dumber than a bimbo. The only reason why anything Alien related happens is because people are fucking morons. That's it. The whole crew lands on an alien planet and gets off the ship with no protective gear whatsoever. Nothing. So of course some dipshit goes for a smoke break and steps on a spore which flies into his ear, and causes him to vomit blood and have an alien burst out of his back. None of this would have happened if this guy wasn't a darwin award.    And if one instance of head slamming stupdity isn't bad enough? There's more where that came from. Two girls kill themselves by slipping on blood like it's a fucking slip and slide, giving the Alien no fight whatsoever. One of them can't even hit the fucking thing in point blank range and then slips on blood and blows herself and the ship up with one giant epic fail.    And speaking of fails? This script for some inane reason decided that the film needed not one but two scenes of David the android playing a fucking flute. A god damn flute. Yeah that's what the franchise was missing...More flute. What the fuck Ridley?    And if the flute scenes aren't dumb enough? This giant piece of fucking space trash has the audacity to absolutely fuck up the entire mystique of the Alien mythos by giving it an explanation that the writers just shat out of their ass and threw onto a piece of paper hoping it would stick. And it's a slap in the fucking face. It really is. It's insulting to see the mythos get such a half assed explanation for it's origins. So David just dicked around with some shit on the planet and just made the eggs and the face huggers? Are you fucking kidding me? What about the Alien queen? You know in Aliens? Oh well that doesn't matter anymore apparently...What in the fucking hell were these writers and Ridley smoking? Lay off the fucking crack guys. Seriously.    Oh and the only reason why we have a traditional Xeno in this? Is because Billy Crudup is one of the dumbest mother fuckers in the universe. I shouldn't be surprised at this point. But I am. Because it is jaw dropping how fucking dumb this movie is.    You don't even get a remarkable or memorable climax out of all of this. The Alien kills a few people, gets sucked out into an airlock again for what feels like the hundredth time, and David fucks over the remaining survivors to use them as incubators for the facehuggers he literally pukes out of his mouth in little eggs that he puts into a case as triumphant music blares like this is some grand amazing moment for this franchise. When a much more appropriate tune would be a death march because I have just witnessed the franchise's funeral right before my very eyes.    This film plays out like a half assed version of Alien. It's unbelievable to me that the same man who directed Alien directed this fucking mess. When you make me pine for and look back fondly at Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, AVP, AVP: R, and Prometheus? You know you fucked up big time.    This is what happens when you fuck a franchise in the ass again and again. You are left with a sagging gaping hole that is shitting everywhere and leaves nothing but a fucking mess. And Ridley? I respect your work and I genuinely do love a lot of your films. But your time has clearly past. And this may be harsh. But I gotta say it.    ""GET AWAY FROM THIS FRANCHISE YOU BITCH!""    Oh and Fox? Stop being a bunch of fuckfaces and making the same mistakes over and over again with the Alien franchise. You passed on a superior script and idea for Alien 3 to make your disaster of a fucking movie, and you did the exact same shit here decades later. By passing on an Alien 5 by Neil Blomkamp for this sequel to Prometheus which now stands as the worst film in the franchise.    Give yourself a hand Fox and Mr. Scott. You guys really outdid yourselves this time. Really fingered my asshole real good and blew so hard and so badly that your failure could be seen and heard all the way into outer space.    Anyway, I am all rambled out. And I am afraid if I think about this film any longer my head will explode. Aliens was the last good Alien film as far as i'm concerned as there is only 2 alien films.",1,3,Johnlindsey289,svnAD0TApb8,-0.13536098310291864,2019-10-01 10:29:45,False,False

2020-04-05T21:52:56,"Fassbender's performances were memorable, but the plot was sloppy - almost nothing about it made any sense.  SPOILERS FOLLOW:  1. They provide no explanation as to why they failed to detect this life-bearing planet.  2. As unlikely as it would be for the planet to have the same gravity and breathable air, they have no information as to the ecology, yet they jump out of their drop ship without any hazmat suits - sure enough within minutes several crew members inhale a lethal substance. That's a really dumb way to go.  3. When they inhale the substance, it causes neomorphs to pop out - within the space of something like a few minutes. If something could grow that fast, what raw materials would it be harvesting in order to gain mass that quickly? Is it sucking the dirt through its feet?  4. Later on, the black substance is shown wiping out the indigenous population like its a poison cloud. Their undisturbed remains look untouched ten years later. More importantly though, the same black substance which creates the neomorphs in humans inexplicably kills the indigenous people outright. Also, was there only one colony of indigenous people? What happened to the rest of them? Why does the flora look like its from Earth?  5. The neomorphs don't have eyes but the bright light of a flare scares them away.  6. David's a head when we leave him in Prometheus but his whole body is repaired by the time he reaches the planet - this is explained by one line of dialogue. How did David get fixed if him and Shaw were stuck on that ship? He wasn't exactly easy to make.  7. The face huggers are an inefficient delivery system for the xenomorphs, even if they can grow ridiculously fast. If it's supposed to be some kind of superweapon its one for one spawning cycle doesn't work very well. With such tiny limbs they wouldn't be able to move very far very fast, so they would have trouble spreading. Once again, a mask could easily prevent it from latching on to a host. On top of that, once born, the alien then goes around killing off all other potential hosts as quickly as possible. The spores work better than the face huggers, and they don't work too well either.   8. In other films, the queen laid the eggs. There doesn't appear to be any queens. Shouldn't that have been the first thing David designed?  9. If David designed the Xenomorphs, what are they doing on an engineers ship in the first movie?  10. If Billy Crudup didn't trust David, why did he stick his head in an egg? Why didn't he get backup?   11. Why did the guns look like something from our time? Aren't there more advanced technologies, or at least guns that don't look like 150 year old relics? We have more advanced weaponry now than what they were packing. Also, a gun would only work in an oxygenated environment, so it would be useless in most environments in space.  12. If Walter had updates, why wasn't he able to beat David?  13. If David has stolen away on board, why does he help the crew kill the Xenomorph?  I'm probably missing some stuff. But not as much as this movie.  (I am not taking credit of any of this words. The above sentences were written by Ryan De Bruys on Google Review. I just wanted to spread the word or this right opinion that I was thinking too.
