In the game they fight quite elegantly yet their execution, moves and combos are quite believable which is why the game looks so cool. Here on the other hand it seems totally overdone. Also the whole take that he lives in some sort of future from which he regresses down memory lane to observe some distant ancestor of his, this seems like a bit to much mixed up in one movie. They should've stuck to the game concept where things happen in a specific set time line and the assassin order is displayed in accordance with the period which is used in each episode.

2016-05-31T13:13:27,"Okay, can I politely ask the fans to stop complaining about the song? Your adding nothing new. Everybody has been saying this since the trailer dropped. Not only that but now they want the trailer to have songs like Ezio's Family to be playing. You know what a stupid move that would be for the creators? First of all have you ever seen any Assassins Creed video game cinematic trailer ever use that song or any previous themes of any of the games? No! They play songs by Woodkid, or Lorde, or artists that nobody has ever heard of. Now think about this. The trailers song is meant to give hype. And I think this song works. But what I would have preferred instead was for there not to be any rapping in the trailer. That would've made it a lot better. And by the way, stop bitching about how the song ""ruined"" the trailer. Please! It's still an exciting and hype trailer! Now I couldn't agree more, I wish they would have chosen a different song.

Está asignado a proteger al príncipe Ahmed (Kemaal Deen-Ellis) de Granada de los Caballeros Templarios. En 1986, el adolescente Callum ""Cal"" Lynch (Angus Brown) encuentra a su madre Mary (Essie Davis) asesinada por su padre, Joseph (Brian Gleeson), un Asesino moderno. Hombres armados liderados por Alan Rikkin (Jeremy Irons), CEO de Abstergo Industries de los Templarios, llegan para capturar a Joseph, quien convence a su hijo para que escape.  En 2016, un adulto Cal (Michael Fassbender) es condenado a muerte por asesinar a un chulo, pero su ejecución es falsificada por Abstergo Industries, que luego lo lleva a su centro de investigación en Madrid. Le dicen que los templarios están buscando el Fruto del Edén para eliminar la violencia usando el código de Fruto para controlar el libre albedrío de la humanidad. Sophia (Marion Cotillard), la hija de Alan y el científico principal, revela que Cal es un descendiente de Aguilar, la última persona que se confirmó que estaba en posesión del Fruto. Ella pone a Cal en el Animus, una máquina que le permite revivir (y los científicos observar) los recuerdos genéticos de Aguilar, para que Abstergo pueda aprender lo que hizo con el Fruto.  En España del siglo XV, Aguilar y su compañera María (Ariane Labed) son desplegados para rescatar a Ahmed, quien ha sido secuestrado por el Gran Maestro Templario Tomás de Torquemada (Javier Gutiérrez), para coaccionar al padre de Ahmed, el sultán Muhammad XII (Khalid Abdalla), para que entregue el Fruto. Aguilar y María interceptan a los templarios, pero son vencidos y capturados por Ojeda (Hovik Keuchkerian), el ejecutor de Torquemada. Cal es rápidamente sacado del Animus por Sophia.",0,0,Stephen Curry,C2e6Oruy_fA,0.0,2019-09-14 02:51:01,False,False
