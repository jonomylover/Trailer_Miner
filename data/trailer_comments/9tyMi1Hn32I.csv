It's a dreamy slow-burn of a film with layers to unravel. It's like if Sofia Coppola directed a horror film. Reminiscent of The Virgin Suicides. I'd say that film meets the original Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street. I am pretty certain there will not be a better horror film this year. It Follows is a gem and like it or not this will be a classic and discussed for years to come. It's not scary, per-se, but the sense of dread throughout makes it incredible tense and unnerving. That's the best word to describe it. Unnerving. If you want a bunch of stupid jump scares to make you scream this is not the movie for you. There is one I can recall but for the most part this is not that kind of movie. Mainstream audiences will be totally bored by this. If you can appreciate how technically well-made a film is and are a sucker for a killer score and gorgeous cinematography then this is a must see. Just see it with an open mind. If you expect some mainstream crap like Ouija or Annabelle and are, in fact, hoping to see the same old thing, you will be disappointed. This is a unique, refreshing film and, IMO, is deserving of the praise. ",7,3,Michael Greenwaldt,9tyMi1Hn32I,0.10567765567765569,2015-04-01 20:52:57,False,True
