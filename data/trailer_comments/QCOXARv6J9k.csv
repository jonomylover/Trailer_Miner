Et c est le sc√©nario grandeur nature qu ils vous proposeront en d√©posant tous les pr√©sidents de tous les pays en d√©voilant leur corruption et a ce moment ils vous proposeront leur roi qui vous sera pr√©sent√© comme un incorruptible, un gentil, et ce sera le grand monarque qu ils attendent tant .

At first I was like nah thats a stupid ending it should have ended like this blah blah blah but actually thinking about it its quite clever. The obvious route to end would be she realises that she's been brainwashed and that its too much but thats predictable and the audience knows that that isnt right, we know how it ended for no privacy wasnt good. This ending shows the effects that this ,  well happy ending i guess you can put it , doesn't have a happy ending or ending at all because its happening NOW. we are all getting brainwashed. this movies ending shows what could and what is happening. It brings fear to the audience but also clarity to this slowly becoming more open online world we live in. While theres positives of it all theres also negatives as this movie shows. It gets the audience to think about how they wouldnt or would want this it gets the audience saying that not right it shouldnt have ended like this it should have ended like this. It bascially shows us what we dont want and i guess thats good i guess. sometimes we need to be shown the bad side of something or just the bad to not have things end up that way.
