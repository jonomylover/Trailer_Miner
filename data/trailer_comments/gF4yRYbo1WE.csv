2019-11-12T06:51:15,I don't normally like to complain about trailers spoiling the entire movie because its a fairly overrated complaint but I have to say this is literally laughable how the films plot twist is told to us in the trailer. Its possible that there is more to the movie but considering that this is a remake of a pretty straight forward slasher film from the 70s which featured one killer picking off girls one at a time like in most traditional slasher films then the idea of some sort of christmas cult would have come as a surprise for those familiar with the original but that wont be the case now thanks to this trailer. I also find it questionable as to why this film looks much campier in tone with the 2006 remake rather than the originals more simple tone. I'm not even a fan of the original film nor the 2006 remake and it looks like this will be yet another let down from the hit or miss studio known as Blum House.,0,0,Cropsy25,gF4yRYbo1WE,0.14347222222222225,2019-11-12 06:51:15,True,True
