2015-02-19T22:56:46,"Far From The Madding Crowd has got to be, one of my most loved love stories that I ever have had the pleasure of reading. Hardy is such a skillful writer and artist. The way he described his characters, their surroundings, and the way he weaved the plot together was so seamlessly intricate, heartbreaking, and uplifting. I honestly believe the relationship between Farmer Oak and Miss Bathsheba to be one of the most realistic portrayals of true love, and I distinctly remember as a young teen reading the book when I was only 15 or so, I thought to myself, ""I want a man like Farmer Oak - who will love me despite my ugly flaws, appreciate and values my strengths, protects me, is critical of me, stern and honest.""",19,4,Farhana Abdul Fatah,VEXGL-Y5D2A,0.2535087719298245,2015-02-19 22:56:46,True,True
