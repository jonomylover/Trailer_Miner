Its a Will Ferrell comedy take on the character.   All Will Ferrell haters save your precious time. If u don't like it don't trash it. Just don't support it and that's it. But as for myself i love all Ferrell's deeds in the industry. Always showing originality in his movies.  Wanna talk about lame comedy movies? then talk about Sandler's nowadays movies. But don't trash something making it look like bad just because u are expecting another iteration of the character.

I think peoples expectations where artificially high because of the success of the duo in the past. I‚Äôve seen reviews criticizing everything. But that‚Äôs the point, it‚Äôs a dumb movie that the viewer has to synchronize with. Just like anchorman or hell even stepbrothers.

It is a criminally shameless cash grab that was created with the sole intention of stealing money from the pockets of unsuspecting movie goers. At least other terrible movies produce some sort of enjoyment due to the fact that they are so bad... However, there was not a single second of this movie that involved something of merit, enjoyment or anything that resembled comedy in any way. It was clearly created without an inch of effort, and feels as though it was written within the space of an hour and filmed in the space of a day. Everyone involved in the creation of this movie should be absolutely completely and utterly ashamed that they were involved in such a horrifically disgusting abomination.

2020-05-30T07:55:47,"At least it looks nice. It's colorful, the costumes look great, the sets are rich and detailed with complex lighting, gorgeous footage of London and a decent trailer (Filled with awful jokes, but that's not the trailer's fault. Biggest fault is using ""The Boys Are Back In Town"") And even though it's a total disgrace to the original character, I'm willing to accept that Will Ferrell plays Holmes, giving it the benefit-of-the-doubt and because I kinda like the idea of a Sherlock Holmes comedy--it makes the stories less dry.  But yeah, I don't need to tell you how awful this movie is.",0,0,Sydney Carton,brjkpRBpFnc,0.08518518518518518,2020-05-30 07:55:47,False,False
