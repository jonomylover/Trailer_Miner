Authorities have evidence of/the facts are United Way gives to St. Vincent de Paul facilities/programs throughout the US as well as the Asthma and  Allergy Foundation of America which is connected with Kids With Food Allergies who wrote a ""Letter to the Makers of the Peter Rabbit Movie: Jokes About Food Allergies Can Put People in Danger"" @ https://community.kidswithfoodallergies.org/blog/letter-to-the-makers-of-the-peter-rabbit-movie-jokes-about-food-allergies-can-put-people-in-danger  Well, all of the NPOs the Black Panthers are in charge of in Phoenix are nothing more than communist brothels as it were because these are overrun by hordes of ex convicts aka pimps who practice communism while spreading the propaganda they're needy/handicapped/homeless and being discriminated against/profiled so keep those tax credits and donations coming to divert from/cover up them selling adultAmericans' mouths to rapists/genitalia to castrators and children's genitalia/hands to molesters/pedophiles, and in the process/the end, disempowering and genociding Americans for profit while enabling terrorists including an undocumented woman who threatens senators to take over areas of the US.   Lumping all of the perps together and calling them Monsters, they have for ages been systematically destroying everything and everyone Americans hold dear including celebrities, amphitheaters, and movie studios, etc. via a number of tactics not limited to harassing/selling celebrities akin to the above, social media smear campaigns, setups/planted evidence, manufactured lawsuits, etc., and their favorite method of getting rid of celebrities - they find this ""exciting"" and ""fun"" - is driving them to suicide when they are at their most vulnerable.   The Monsters were overheard saying that by the time they're done with Hollywood it will be run almost entirely by pedophiles and only groomed children and adult actors willing to work with them who don't get physically sick will be given acting roles.  So, perhaps, rather than Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Pictures Animation, Columbia Pictures, and Animal Logic needing to apologize to the public, they need to sue the Black Panthers and their NPOs, and squash the Monsters like gnats while Hollywood still exists?
