Of course, under Rocky's mentorship he quickly shows he too has real talent for the sport and goes pro. Apollo's son would eventually have a real surrogate father/son type bond with Rocky and they would become a solid team in and out of the ring.

I was hoping it was just a rumor but looks like it's true but Creed Jr's firm statement to The Italian Stallion that if he fights he should keep fighting as well gives me hope that Rocky will end up KO'ing whatever illness he has in the film!!! I mean hasn't the man suffered enough with having his hard-earned wealth stolen from him, his first protege's treachery, being estranged from his son not once but twice & losing many of his closest friends & loved ones along the way such as Mickey, Apollo, his beloved wife Adrian & now Paulie too? Keep flying Rock!!!  1 thing about the new trailer that's got me a bit confused is when Creed Jr says he bounced around foster care in & out for yrs but how can that be if his mother, Apollo's widow is still clearly alive & well? Just how could he have been in foster care when he's still got his mom around & not only that, judging by the looks of how she's dressed & her fancy home, The Creed family still maintains the high-end lifestyle that the ol' Master of Disaster earned over his yrs of dominance in the ring!!!

2015-10-16T15:46:36,In terms of the outcome of the fight Creed is in a bit of a no win situation.  If Adonis Creed just goes the distance then critics will call it a recycling of the first Rocky.   But if he ends up winning the championship then they'll call it a predictable outcome.   Regardless of whether Adonis wins in the end or not I think what will ultimately make the film should it work is his journey getting to the climactic fight.   I just have a feeling that Michael B. Jordan and Stallone are going to have good on screen chemistry.  That is obviously a big key if Creed is going to be a winner.   I can't wait to see Creed.,0,0,JSL79,JQ9OhBYjTds,0.12777777777777777,2015-10-16 15:46:36,True,True

2015-12-20T16:57:45,"Puffy nosed pimp lookin poser stallone, (van damme would kick your ass) U think youre rocky so bad that u try to pose as some pro boxer . why in the hell make a movie on ward,patriotic perhaps? Lol andre ward is a true primadonna and crybaby bitch. A) SoC never took on a challenge outside his homecountry, outside his comfort zone without handpicked officials AKA not a road warrior, all champions fought other champions outside their country in the past.- Makes his own rules ,B) ducking below the waist. C) sucker punching when the ref steps in, D) elbows to opponents face mayweather style, E) ducking below the waistline to avoid getting hit and frustrating opponents F) headbutts like a battering ram (like the notorious leaping headbutts in the kessler fight) when we saw andre get his own medicine against bika it was hillarious seeing him cry after the fight complaining about the headbutts, double standards hypocrite. Froch is the real 168 champion,road warrior he took on all corners , and like i said he always comes back stronger in the rematch. Fx in the first kessler fight (in mikkel kessler backyard) I had froch winning and this is coming from a dane no bias (viking from denmark) it was a draw at best and froch wasnt even giving it all. In the rematch however we saw how froch took kessler apart with relative ease, keeping him at bay with the long jab troughout most of the fight and also hurting mikkel with venomous powershots. Same with groves Carl weathered the storm in the first fight and tko'd groves in the 9th. In the rematch froch annihilated groves without problems knocked him out colder than ice. Paddy ran for the antivenom when he saw how the cobra venomously knocked his fighter back into last century. Im sure froch would solve the ward puzzle if he got a rematch w a proper rereree that enforce the rules of boxing.Andre can drag dawson down no problem but face golovkin at a catchweight? Hell no . bring fighters to his comfort zone to get shitted on w the scorecards and frustrating them w dirty illegal tactics sure no problem but going to nottingham and rematch froch? Out of the question. Even though it would be the biggest fight of his career both money wise and legacy. He is a smalltime primadonna fighting in small half empty arenas while froch sells out stadiums w 80.000+ spectators at the edge of their seats. Andre says he will do this and that but always prices himself out when it comes down to a challenge. I doubt we will even see him fight kovalev . probably gonna pull out w a bogus injury unless they can slip some kind of poison into kovalevs system before the fight, causing sergei to be a shell of his former self. He wont even do olympic style drug testing. Kinda like floyd with his paid off secret commission doing it for him Btw if andre is reading this i will gladly take you on anytime anywhere. (Just allow me a 3month training camp) Im undefeated so probably its better then dragging paul smith up to 172 who already lost twice to shellcrab abraham '.;.;.` fucking poser Lets see if Virgil Cunter and S.o.Cunt has a response. Im sure his diet contains mainly squids and goatmeat since he did perfect his octopus billygoat style of fighting. All these asslicking mofos get a boner from seeing sly midget ass Lol at his name sly anyway.

The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.  Revelation 20:14-15 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. THIS IS THE SECOND DEATH.  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.  DOES ANYONE MEASURE UP TO GOD'S STANDARD?  Romans 3:23 For ALL have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.  HOW CAN WE BE SAVED?  John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever BELIEVETH in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt BELIEVE in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Romans 10:10 For with the heart man BELIEVETH unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  WHAT EXACTLY DID HE DO TO SAVE US?  1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ DIED FOR OUR SINS according to the scriptures; And that he WAS BURIED, and that he ROSE AGAIN THE THIRD DAY according to the scriptures:  1 Peter 3:18 For Christ also hath once SUFFERED FOR SINS, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:  HOW ARE WE CLEANED FROM SIN?  Hebrews 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged WITH BLOOD; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  Colossians 1:20 And, having made peace through THE BLOOD of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.  IS IT FREE OR DO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING FOR IT?  Ephesians 2:9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that NOT OF YOURSELF: it is the GIFT OF GOD:Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the GIFT OF GOD is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  CAN YOU BE CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE SAVED?   I John 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; THAT YE MAY KNOW that ye have eternal life, and that ye may BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God.  HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?  John 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath EVERLASTING life.  ARE YOU PROTECTED AGAINST LOSING YOUR SALVATION?  Ephesians 4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby YE ARE SEALED unto the day of redemption.  Jude 1:1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and PRESERVED in Jesus Christ, and called:  CALL ON HIS NAME!  Psalms 116:13  I will take the cup of salvation, and CALL UPON THE NAME OF LORD.   Romans 10:13  For whosoever shall CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD shall be saved.  Pray: LORD I believe I am a sinner. I know I deserve to go to hell.
