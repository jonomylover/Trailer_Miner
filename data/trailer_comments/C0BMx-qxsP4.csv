""They"" didn't stop there. Understanding that images projected unto the public ripple out through quantum space and time to manifest in reality, the ""Sad Keanu"" meme was created to further torment the poor actor who was once the poster child for sovereign awareness and enlightenment.

It was nice seeing Keanu Reeves kicking ass again.  The story was simple and straightforward and unlike a lot of other action movies these days, it doesn't insult your intelligence. (Some of the scenes actually brought a tear to my eye)  It also had some surprisingly funny moments that had my theater laughing out loud.

I came into it not expecting anything, though there were plenty of things wrong with this movie, and it's loaded with scenes that blatantly don't make sense. The only thing well done about it is the action choreography, which is incredibly well done. Everything else just falls flat because there's little plot to hold onto, the characters are not really all that interesting, and the jokes went over your head. It was trying to be similar to The Transporter, or any other action mixed with comedy but it really didn't get there. Every other movie Keanu Reeves made was great, even the one's that people think are bad but this one just doesn't match up. I don't understand why this movie got such extremely high ratings. John Wick would have been better if it was taken seriously as a film, though clearly no one took it seriously and everything felt rushed.¬†",0,0,Michael,C0BMx-qxsP4,0.03523333333333335,2015-01-26 15:10:45,False,False

2020-04-17T04:27:05,"Action packed adventure with a lone gunman's quest for revenge. I have seen this film twice and was drawn in with Keanu Reeves in the lead, he is awesome in this action thriller that had me glued to the screen. Wick was created with two great stunt directors (David Leitch and Chad Stahelski), as this movie rocks with action.  The film starts with the death of Wick‚Äôs wife and the introduction of a beagle puppy, the adorable Daisy was a gift from Wick‚Äôs deceased wife. Russian thugs break into Wick‚Äôs house because they want to steal his classic Mustang, then mercilessly beat him as well as kill his dog.  What these young thugs don‚Äôt realize is that Wick is a retired hit man with a frightening reputation. Wick's former employer, Russian mafioso Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), is the father of the ringleader of the raid to steal his car and kill his dog, Alfie Allen from Game of Thrones.¬†  Nyqvist is positively Putinesque, cruel and menacing with his heavy Russian accent and squinting eyes. When he‚Äôs not yelling or pounding people, he sits by his fireplace singing Russian folk songs.  Reeves, with shaggy hair and a three-piece suit, plays the introverted assassin well, it‚Äôs easy to root for a grieving husband who has just lost his devoted pet. John Wick goes the distance and beyond with the films increased carnage threshold. Brawls throughout each sequence attempts to outdo the last. John Wick has a more interesting storyline and better drama than most that draws you in and never let's go, I highly recommend this film as one of the best action films I have seen in years.",0,0,Mike Edelstein,C0BMx-qxsP4,0.10300940438871474,2020-04-17 04:27:05,False,False
