But I must say, the ""death trap"" movie concept, even if you're specifically looking at escape room movies, isn't exactly a novel idea lol. Funny enough, all except for two of them, plus the new one, are from Lionsgate.  Cube series (1997, 2002, 2004; Lionsgate) - same general idea, but not an ""escape room,"" per se. Saw franchise (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2017; Lionsgate) - again, not an actual escape room, but it's still pretty much the same escape-or-die concept. Cabin in the Woods (2012; Lionsgate) - not an escape room, but again close in concept to one. Escape Room (2017; Global Genesis Group) - an escape room, but with a demonic killer inside. Escape Room (2017; Lionsgate) - yes, there were two movies titled Escape Room that were released in 2017. This one is more on par with the new one coming out, a Saw-inspired escape room death trap. No Escape Room (2018; MarVista Entertainment) - a SyFy movie about an escape room, but with an evil spirit inside.",0,0,Tyler Emery,6dSKUoV0SNI,0.14839572192513367,2018-10-27 06:34:05,True,True

Genius really.  But we needed more on the last 3, especially Jason.... And not TOLD to us. These are important characters. Knowing a bit more about their lives will help the audience care. AND NO... not showing them solve the same cube.   The movie needed to be more self aware of what it is. It reminds me so much of 'Maze Runner' and why it fell short, though they are not the same. A  little bit of comedy relief would help in this movie. I was waiting  for someone to say ""I just met the guy, should I start crying?"" . The kind of comedy that is dark and not shitting on other people. Danny should have been more like Jazz from ""The Fresh Prince"". I did like how obsess he was with the escape rooms though. Nice touch.  Showing what happens at the beginning of the movie was the dumbest thing ever. The audience isn't stupid. We knew it would have gone either way. He either lives or dies... We knew everyone else dies. And the actions leading to Zoey possum were really predictable. This was not the way to make the movie any less linear.  If not all, most of the questions we had were answered with assumptions. Maybe hinting for a sequel... but that actually does the opposite. Not many people will want a sequel from watching this movie.  It would be great if Zoey had learned something unique from each of them. In fact I think this would have made it a better ending.  Ben should have died in the last room... with Danny's phone in his possession, hoping to bring everything to light. The psycho even more eccentric than what was portrayed in the film, explains everything to Zoey after escaping a sneak attack from her (here we get a hint of a higher power)... Gun, out of ammo, thrown to the side. Psycho then proceeds to tell her his story... His character motivation, as if putting on a show for the audience....  Walking around the sofa, Zoey grabs the mic next to the laptop. Both faced each other in anticipation. Psycho gets in close , like an anaconda, he restricts her movement. Zoey unable to move her arms, kicked and screamed.. Freed her arm and clubbed him with the mic. She then proceeded to bash his head in. Zoey escapes. Gets medical treatment. Cop doesn't believe her story and hints that he's a part of the organization ...  Last scene, Zoey waves bye at her roommate who is off to meet with friends.  She now makes her own investigation in secret and accepts the burden of being alone and the one left behind.",0,0,flat_foot,6dSKUoV0SNI,0.08839869281045751,2019-05-25 10:31:31,False,False
