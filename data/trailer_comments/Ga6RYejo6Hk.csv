All of sudden there was either an atomic bomb or meteor I think it was a meteor yeah it was it flew across the sky and BOOM! it happened the exploring was coming near and my brother and my grandma cam close and hold hands and my grandma makes a prayer and I say ""I hope heaven is awesome"" The flash was white and then everything w.entry black for 4 seconds barely felt pain I could basically feel it in real life too so it was like I was their too. The darkness took about 2 seconds to go away then I saw... HEAVEEEN. It's amazing it was like playing minecraft you have everything and don't have to pay for nothing. Well me and my grandma I really don't know where my brother went but we saw God and I saw what I love video games in heaven but I talked to God with my grandma first and then we talked about the questions you would ask in heaven. I asked how long do you live in heaven to God and he said ""Infinite"" it's like when you start a new game God shows you the basics of heaven we have rooms for out hobbies and we have fun. Bit I lost the heaven dream after the conversation with God.

2017-11-29T15:33:59,"So from what I perceived from this trailer:  -Kids named  Miguel dreaming of becoming a musician, but is somewhat inhibited by his own grandmother's disdain for music.  -Chanclazo (not surprising from a movie relating to Mexican culture).  -Miguel's great great father named Ernesto de la Cruz, left home with his guitar and became one of the most famous musicians of all time. So I'm going to predict at one point in the film Miguel is going to meet Ernesto and accomplish his dream of becoming a musician.   -Miguel plays Ernesto's guitar, unknowingly transporting himself into the land of the dead. Since this is a movie based on Mexican culture, it's themed on the holiday of the Day of the Dead (of course!).  -Miguel meets his deceased relatives throughout the film.  -A harsh precept of the Land of the Dead: When completely forgotten by every living relative or no relative to remember them, the deceased disappear forever.  -Miguel is slowly becoming one of the dead himself the longer he stays in the Land of the Dead.  -Scenes that include Miguel being pursued by a jaguar deity from Mesoamerican culture resembling an alabrije.

There are other differences these two movies have. Believe me, I was on the whole, they ripped off this, but as time went on, the arguments won me over to watch it the opening day, an it was amazing!

Which they later changed to ""Coco"". A film in which no one can just out right deny their similarities. From their leading characters (M) struggles with family traditions and love of music. To the adventures from the living world through the land of the dead. Not all of it is similar. But, the creators, writers, producers of The Book of Life were (majority) of the Hispanic ethnicity /(Mexican heritage). While Coco, was created by a bunch of white peopleüòÇüòÇüòÇ   Which is the most hilarious part, because I saw some ppl commenting on how Coco is a more genuine and honest portrayal of Mexican culture! Like, the cast of The Book of Life have experience less of the day  of the dead than the said white ppl who created Coco.   Some even argued the music choices. Like it made it any less representative of Mexican culture. Because they felt their was a lack of Mexican originated music in TBOL in contrast to Coco. In which I could agree, ""Do ya think I'm sexy"" isn't a Mexican originated song. But, those kinds of songs were covered in a Mexican style and put in for the enjoyment, relatability and familiarity of all families (those of this country least of all).   And if you look at their soundtrack there wouldn't be an argument, considering only (what?) 3-4 popular American songs out of 18-20. (But, that is just knit picking...)   Both movies are wonderful, it's good to see two movies out there exemplifying Mexican culture especially nowadays (with our unfortunate POTUS). I'm a bit biased to The Book of Life, because it was first and it was made genuinely. While I feel Coco was made by Disney/Pixar in an attempt to step on the underdog.

2018-04-28T15:49:20,"I have some plot ideas for a sequel or something.  Maybe one Dia de Muertos, Hector and the family go to visit the living. As they walk through the cemetery, Hector spots a food that he really likes on de la Cruz's tomb and he takes it. Myabe there's this rule for the dead where if you take someone else's offerings, you are cursed to become solid slowly, but you will fade away because you died, but since you're becoming solid, you will disappear becasye you already died. But anyway, that happens and through the night Hector begins turning solid slowly. Meanwhile, Miguel does something he's not supposed to and is about to get caught. He ends upon the ofrenda room, when he gets the idea to steal from the dead again so he won't get caught. So he eats some food on the ofrenda and becomes a ghost. He has to sneak out of the compound with Hector so he can get hid blessing in the Land of the Dead and avoid trouble.  Also, maybe Miguel meets Ernesto's real great great grandson who still supports de la Cruz. He gets into the Rivera home and tears off the part of the photo with Hector on it and like burns it or something. Hector is trapped in the Land of the Living since he can't cross the bridge without a photo. As he slowly becones solid throughout the night, he has the ability to interact with objects as a half-ghost, still invisible. But near sunrise, Hector's living form beguns to show, which gives Miguel the opportunity to take a picture of him and put it on the ofrenda so he can go back quickly. It needs more complexity, but yeah. It also needs and emphasis on Coco still, or amybe Miguel's sister Socorro because I heard somewhere Coco and Socorro were like the sane thing?

2018-06-14T22:53:01,"This was an absolute masterpiece. The final scenes where Miguel sang to his great grandmother reminded me my own grandmother's last days.... And she did remember me. I loved her dearly. She had multiple sclerosis and didn't remember anyone for the most part. But on the last days, before she died, I was talking to her and she ran her hand across my face and told me ""I loved it when you came to visit Victor"". She did remember me. She was accepted on that day into hospital. Two days later, she passed away and I was at school when she did. And when Miguel's grandmother put Mama Coco's photo up, I couldn't hold it. Cause we do remember our family history... we do and we will never forget. My great grandfather, a decorated war hero. My great grandmother, a rebel to the end, died next to my great grandfather. My grandfathers, both proud military men. My grandmother. A passionate cook and my other grandmother, a dedicated and loving school teacher. You will not be forgotten.   A friend called me over to watch some silly animated movie over dinner and drinks, called ""Coco"". By the end of the movie, we were both crying. 25 year old men sobbing and if you got a problem with that, come say it face to face! There is nothing wrong with loving and caring about your family. It's admirable and wonderful.",46,0,Megadriver,Ga6RYejo6Hk,0.29038461538461535,2018-06-14 22:53:01,False,False

2018-06-29T21:02:51,"So....my family barely talks about death. It makes my family too upset and angry so I learned not to ask anything and I kept pictures and trinkets of theirs in my room because if I put them anywhere else in the house they just get put away. I barely see our extended family and only have a few pictures of them that we have framed. I don't know which of my relatives are still alive and which ones have died. I only found out one of my aunts died two years after she was gone. I'd been writing letters to her and not getting any responses and realized that was why. I was crushed. When I saw this movie I cried so much, some from sadness and some happy, because I saw how death was treated in this culture. I knew about Day of the Dead already and like getting items that are made in honor of the event. My family thinks they're creepy, but I think they're good. One of my aunts, she's pretty religious, doesn't like the idea of Day of the Dead. She doesn't think family members should be put on an altar and ""worshipped"". I think it's stupid and sad to worship a God who doesn't exist over one's family members. I wish all the time that we could treat death the way people do in Mexico, and in other places across the world. It's healthy to talk about it and healthy to keep all the things your loved ones loved so you can remember them. I'm sure my aunt doesn't really understand the Day of the Dead because sadly her religion states that understanding others' religions and culture isn't good. I don't care though and I'll always love Dia de los Muertos and the attitude some other cultures have about death. No one lives forever and it's sad, we're just human and we get sad about that. But bottling everything up and never talking about family members or death is very damaging. I miss my family members but it's worse never talking about them.",0,0,Serasia,Ga6RYejo6Hk,0.03714285714285714,2018-06-29 21:02:51,False,False
