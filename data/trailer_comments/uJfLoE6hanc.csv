2014-08-01T16:28:16,"Being from Pittsburgh, I have always been partial in my appreciation for Michael Keaton. Regardless, he is a hell of an actor, with a unique brand of black humor and comic cynicism, which give rise to an amazing palette of subtle mannerisms through which he is able to convey an endless array of emotions and ideas. He is an advanced actor, on a level far above where today's young actors are operating, and often lately feels like a fish out of water. In most of his recent roles, Keaton is am island, a lone source of real talent and acting ability in the midst of a cast full of beautiful faces and bodies, but possessing the acting abilities of a high school drama class. He can play incredibly nuanced roles that would be impossible for most other actors. My favorite Keaton role has always been sociopath/psychopath predator Carter Hayes from ""Pacific Heights."" Batman was probably one of my least favorite roles of his. Batman was more a vehicle for Nicholson's manic Joker and Burton's dark aesthetic and interpretation of Gotham City than Keaton's acting skills. The Batman role was extremely restrictive and allowed for very little actual acting. Keaton's Bruce Wayne was as lifeless and two-dimensional as it gets, the role did him no justice as far as providing a vehicle for him to truly shine as an actor. I'm sure the exposure, fame and $$$ made up for that, though, although I wonder if he regrets in now, having painted himself in a corner of sorts by allowing himself to be typecast on a massive level of Mark Hamill/Luke Skywalker proportions. I think he was chosen for the role of Batman because of his jawline, actually, if I remember correctly (not to diss his talent, I'm just repeating what I read). Anyways, you cannot go wrong with Keaton. He shines in every role he plays. He will even make a crap film watchable, as was the case recently with Robocop (Keaton and Oldman were the only reasons I was able to sit through that one). I'm super stoked he is becoming active again, as Hollywood is in dire need of talent these days. These kids the studios are featuring in starring roles have the emotional depth of a mud puddle and are nothing more than eye candy - models with attractive faces and bodies and nothing else. Between these phony ""actors"" and all of the crappy CGI that saturates every movie that Hollywood puts out, it's no wonder Hollywood is losing money this summer.",0,0,erreur,uJfLoE6hanc,0.1192227564102564,2014-08-01 16:28:16,True,True

Ayoye le meilleur film que j'ai vu dans les 20 dernières années. (Bon, l'un des meilleurs films.) La réalisation audacieuse et astucieuse , la direction d'acteur absolument impeccable, le scénario des plus imprévisible et déstabilisant, ce film de presque trois heures m'a profondément troublé.  Si vous voulez savoir ce que c'est que de jouer au théâtre, la production, les histoires de coulisses, le désagrément de mal choisir son partenaire de scène... (eh oui) la relation avec les critiques le stress que ça implique, le tract ... ici le théâtre est mis totalement à nue.  Mais il y a aussi le show-business comme: l'égocentrisme, comprendre comment on peut étouffer lorsque l'ont est collé à son image publique et ce besoin d'exister... de partager, qui vous oblige viscéralement a continuer, à défaut de pouvoir concevoir faire autre chose que ce qui vous colle à la peau et coule dans vos veines, comme de la drogue forte, mais aussi nécessaire et essentiel que l'oxygène pour vivre... l'art.  On parle de cette boule dans l'estomac , cette chose que vous avez sur le coeur et qui vous oblige a créer et a perpétuellement recommunier avec le public.  Ce film fait le tour de tout ça magistralement.  Si vous aimez les films sur le ""milieu"", celui-là est un incontournable que vous devez absolument aller voir!  C'est magique, fantastique et en même temps (ce qui est un tour de force), hyper réaliste.  J'ai ce film dans la tête depuis trois jours, personnellement il me permet de me réajuster au diapason de ce que je suis.

2014-11-02T04:25:47,"""Birdman"" is about an aging actor with career-defining superhero role from the past trying to put up a serious play on Broadway, fighting his inner demons (most notably the Birdman himself) up until the last minute before the opening performance. It is about theater actors, it moves more like a play than a movie, and it's very New York. In fact, each scene is like a long act of a live theater play, where each act is one continuous shot with just 1 camera located right up on the actors' noses. There is no cutaway, switch of cameras, or editing within a scene. That must require incredible acting skills from all performers, and all participating actors deliver 100%. They effortlessly (seemingly) switch from back stage scenes to on stage mode with 180 degree emotional shifts in less than a second. Michael Keaton, who had a stint in a Bat suit in his real life, is particularly great as the former Birdman. A memorable scene where he banters with a theater critic in a bar shows his real range. Everyone else really brings it, too. Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts all freely show more dimensions than in other movies, and the director Alejandro Iñárritu (of ""21 Gram"", ""Babel"", ""Amores Perros"", etc.) makes the best of them. This is not an editor's movie that is constructed from 20 takes of short bursts of performances, but an actors' movie where the pace is completely controlled by the actors.

Sí, los cortes en negro fueron los que ayudaron a dividir las escenas, pero todo el rodaje, un Arte.  Como si hubiesen hecho el breakdown en una toma continua.  La escenografía y la entrada de los actores  tan coordinadas como si estuviesen haciendo teatro más que cine, Imagino como fue preparar todo esto en un movimiento de cámara continua y en diferentes escenarios de esas mismas locaciones.  La historia es toda una sátira del ego de los artistas y de cómo se maneja este medio.  Además una critica muy  sencilla al cine comercial y Holliwoodense de ciencia ficción, violento y comercial.

Cast is superb, Michael Keaton just confirms our faith in him from our childhood and his role of Batman, because we who loved Batman knew Michael is capable for much more. If you do not like Batman and Michael Keaton - go fuck yourself!  This is a good drama, and drama is the queen of all genres. If you do not like dramas - go fuck yourself!

2015-03-19T10:03:46,"BIRDMAN REVIEW!  Birdman was a film that kept me in a trance for the entire film. Its conceptual idea around the world of reality and then the imagination of Michael Keatons’ character, Riggan Thomson/Birdman absolutely captured me, I could not look away. The prowling of the camera and the craftiness they used to make it seem like one long continuous shot through the entire film created this intense atmosphere. One continuous shot, there was only one or two points when I though “no way… didn't that scene just cut?” It kept me so intrigued not only in the spectacular cinematography but in the life of Riggan. Iñárritus’ direction of the characters around the camera made it flow so perfectly, making the idea of one continuous shot so much more believable.  The acting was tremendous, actors playing actors was such an epic part of the story. Michael Keaton held himself well playing a washed-up actor, who once played an iconic superhero, battle{ing} his ego... (IMDB, 2014) “Birdman” matched him as an actor so well. It reminded me of when he played Batman in the 1989 film. Mass nostalgia! I also loved the acting from Edward Norton who was nominated for “Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role” for playing Mike.   Iñárritus’ concept that Birdman was a figment of Riggans imagination and an essense of himself kept me captivated and had me thinking is this real? Is he really a superhero?    I find that a movie is most successful when it keeps the audience thinking about it even after the movie is over; this is also why the idea of leaving an ending which was pretty much open to interpretation resonated with me.   The ending was a great moment, where Emma Stone looked down and saw her father’s dead body as he jumped, and then looks up potentially seeing her father from his point of view and how he saw himself, being free, being Birdman. Because the ending was so open to interpretation, people began to speculate whether Sam, Riggan’s daughter actually went mad after seeing her father die. She became immersed into the world of seeing things that aren't there.   (“6 Deep Thoughts About 'Birdman'” explains this concept further)    The whole idea of the film was to play at the idea that as an artist you push yourself to the point where you become something else, it’s when you realise you need to be yourself you create The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance. Like the final play at the end of the film when Michael Keaton changed it up by using a real gun, and coming to terms with his true self and the idea he wanted to be free, Tabitha wrote about it as The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance. Riggan stopped being someone he wasn't and started being himself.   Overall the film definitely deserved “Best Motion Picture of the Year”, “Best Director. Writer, Original Screenplay and Cinematography”. 10/10, would watch again!",1,0,Court.,uJfLoE6hanc,0.25098995271867613,2015-03-19 10:03:46,False,False

Especially in the writting !  The cinematography is awesome too, but it wasn't the first time I was seeing a one take movie. There's a french film from early 2000's called Irreversible which is like that. But it's more dark and violent, and the story's told backwards. But in Birdman this choice of the one take is not to show off, it really serves the story. There's no frontier or at least, we and the characters kind of lose it, between stage and backstage, real and unreal, and that's what the movie is about (not only, this movie is about plenty of things).  The trailer doesn't give it justice, I think a lot of people didn't liked it because it wasn't sold properly, and maybe most of them where thinking it was actually kind of a superhero movie.

2015-10-04T16:01:46,"I wanted to like this movie but it seemed dragged in some parts and I was saying in my mind ""I'm not enjoying this"" but for some reason, it's still an intriguing film. I was also saying to myself ""I'm probably not going to watch this a second time...."" but when the movie finished I think I changed my mind. (I think the last 30 minutes was where the movie was at its best, less dragged than the earlier scenes.)  In my opinion it's a very flawed movie (or perhaps I just don't care about the theatre industry) but for some reason, it keeps me thinking back to it.  I don't know if it was a particularly intelligent movie and some of it flew over my head or maybe it was overly pretentious and overly artsy in an abstract way. I don't know, perhaps I need to watch it a second time but I did notice some scenes/shots were dragged and overly long.  The drumming sound thing was pretty nice; it gave the movie more of a personality, atmosphere and suspense. Excellent acting by Keaton, Norton, Stone, etc. I'm just a bit disappointed by the excessive dialogue, and the story as it was partially repetitive, involving the ""pistol shot himself for real"" theatre cliche (which was also hard to watch, especially as he shot himself I think on 3 occassions if I recall correctly).  I think the movie was a little restricted in the threatre universe. When the movie truly excelled was mostly in scenes outside the theatre, like when Keaton was trying to get back to the theatre, avoiding people's attention and the scenes were Birdman appeared and when Riggan flew.  I think this movie had too much theatre and not enough Birdman. I felt like some loose ends were not tied and I wasn't satisfied. Just my opinion. I welcome an alternative view as I still think I need a second viewing to understand how I really felt about this movie. There were some funny parts to this movie too (not the profanity) but the way the music assisted with scenes and Birdman was a great character that I think should have been used more. I think the movie's location restriction made it feel sort of small, limited and repetitive. But it was worth a watch.Maybe even a second one.  If they make a Birdman 2, PLEASE, add more action, more Birdman and more adventurous locations instead of the restriction to the dark theatre which gave a lot of this movie a visually dark palette.

2015-11-29T03:33:13,"The bad ratings this movie gets from the general public is the ultimate proof of the intellectual capacity (or lack of) that the average movie viewer has nowadays. Unless there's shooting, killing, people flying around in space suits, a shit ton of special effects that are there just for the sake of it and a story-line with a happy ending written so that a 5 year old could follow it, they don't like it. This is not supposed to be an action film or a story driven film. That's for those who say ""nothing happens"", by the way.  Oh really? Nothing happens? Nothing except 2 hours of stunning soundtrack, basically perfect cinematography,pretty much filmed in one shoot (which is INCREDIBLY difficult) and excellent acting, with a very satirical story (most of you probably don't even know what satire is).  I usually wouldn't do this, and I'm usually the guy who hates people who say what I'm about to say because it sounds arrogant, I hate the critics of contemporary art or people who say they see things that others don't just for the sake of making themselves look better, but in THIS CASE, I really have to stand on their side, because if you really think nothing happens in this movie, and don't see the quality of it, or full out hate it like a lot of people do, then I'm sorry, but you're simply stupid. I don't see any other explanation for why someone would HATE this movie. I get it if you don't love this movie, or even if you don't like it, but go to IMDB and 90% of people give it ONE star. ONE!  That means that they have the lowest possible opinion of it, and I just CANNOT understand how someone would hate THIS PARTICULAR movie so much. I just don't understand how so many people would hate something that has so many very very obvious qualities that deserve a lot of credit. Just for the soundtrack, cinematography and acting, this movie deserves a 7,5 out of 10, even if you absolutely hate the rest of it. That's just a fact, it's not a matter of opinion. Just from a technical point of view, regardless of what actually happens in a movie, Birdman is a world class achievement and one of the best movies of the year in that regard, and anyone who disagrees is wrong. This is not even a matter of an opinion. I'll repeat again, in any other case, I'd hate and insult a person who'd say what I just said, but in THIS case, people are just pushing their unreasonable hate too far.     And no, I'm not a fucking movie critic who likes the smell of his own farts, just in case someone accuses me of that, I'm a medical doctor, I have nothing whatsoever to do with the movie industry.",749,77,BeyerT1,uJfLoE6hanc,0.003917748917748943,2015-11-29 03:33:13,False,False

It is just as Albert Camus observed: that real knowledge about a thing comes from following the logic of it to its bitter end, not abdicating this course even when it gets difficult. It is very demanding and the cost exorbitantly high, reason few have ever ventured to these distant regions.
