2017-04-01T20:02:39,"The movie was great! Here it is the original story frome book ""“The President’s Vampire” by Robert Damon Schneck :  In Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, three college students got together to play  with an old Ouija board that one of them had found in their attic. They  began experimenting with it. One of the three, named Eli, had always had  an interest in the paranormal, being an avid ghost hunter. He hadn’t  much luck with it – nothing occurs when he is around. The other two,  named Katherine and John, were also interested. They wanted to come up  with something, using the ouija board, that none of them could have  known and couldn’t have come from their subconscious minds. After many  failed attempts, the ouija board finally began to work. What came out  were a kind of new-age messages, about love and higher vibrations. The  three did notice however that the spirits were making references to an  entity or being which they seemed to be afraid of. Eli, who loved scary  stuff, wanted to pursue what that spirit was. All of the spirits left,  except for one, that called itself “the Spirit of the Board”. It refused  to give more details, however, after several attempts at asking, over  several sessions, the spirit gave this account:  The creature it  was afraid of was a man who was born about 1912 in Algiers, Louisiana.  He was born an albino and was left at a local orphanage. As he grew up  he lost his sight and became violent. He attempted to run away from the  orphanage several times, but he was always found and brought back. One  night, he took a large pair of scissors, attacked a nurse and fled to  the train yards. He became involved with voodoo or black magic, and  became a kind of a monster who developed a name that became a folklore  figure, a bit like the “Candyman” from the movie. He began wearing  glasses that were painted black – after all, he was blind. He started  killing people; they began to find bodies horribly mutilated by the  train tracks all over the country, or at least all over the south. The  man then started putting together a friend or a pet, from the tongues  and eyes of his victims that acted as his eyes. It would whistle when a  victim was found and he closed in on them. But he found his victims in  an unusual way – whenever someone would think about his name, or  concentrate on the name he gave himself, it was a psychic beacon and the  man was aware of them. As long as someone thought about his name, he  would begin to move towards them.  They thought that was the end of the story…until… One  night, Eli and Katherine went to a concert in Wausau, Wisconsin and  they were walking along a rail bridge to an island named Barker Stewart  Island, which was known as Body Island, because bodies used to wash up  on the shore from the lumberyard upstream.  As they were walking, Eli  saw a turtle in the river, so he climbed down to see it. While he was  gone, Katherine heard a whistle.  A whistle that got louder and louder.  She panicked and ran away. They later broke up and she started dating John.  All three had trouble sleeping. They would always wake up at 3 AM. One  night, John heard a knock on his door…”Come on John, we’re going out for  breakfast”, John turned and noticed it was dark out – it was the middle  of the night. The knock came again. Paralysed with fear, John dropped  to the floor where he noticed, in the crack under the door, two shadows.  A tall one and a small one. He remained there the rest of the night.  Could it have been the man who’s name he had been thinking about?  The mans name is……   The Bye-Bye Man",0,0,mr. VoodooChild,S2DwrJ9S3f4,0.018093549476528203,2017-04-01 20:02:39,False,True
