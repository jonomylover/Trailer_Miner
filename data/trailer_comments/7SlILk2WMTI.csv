I did think they showed a little too much in the trailer. Quite honestly they shouldn't have shown the helicarrier crashing.(I know this was shown in a previous trailer as well.. they shouldn't have shown it there either). They should have left that for the movie it would have dropped a lot of jaws but now we're all expecting it so it's not as effective. They just did that to bring people in and make money but it would have make the movie better if they would have left it a surprise.

He puts up a good fight, but ultimately he could not win until he had a power advantage (which was only temporary) and probably will not be displayed in this movie.

They said it will be like a spy thriller, so it should be interesting and fun. SPECULATIONS: I think following The Winter Soldier's attack, Nick Fury is heavily injured and later dies (Natasha, Steve and Maria are looking at a covered body). This will probably prompt Cap to go all one man army commando mode against the bad guys, who'll probably be a rogue faction of SHIELD in league with the Winter Soldier. And to top it off all, the rogue faction is led by Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), who's probably an extremist who believes in large sacrifices for the greater good.

2014-02-04T21:18:56,"I remember whenever I watched Captain America: The First Avenger and saw when Bucky fell off of train plummeting into the snow below the first thing that instantly came to my mind as I chuckled with a smile on my face was, ""Oh look, Winter Soldier, see you in the next movie Buck.""  I wasn't saying this in a mocking way because I liked the last Cap movie, and after Avengers I was really looking forward to this movie. More and more I am looking forward to this movie as my anticipated movie of 2014. Trailer after Trailer, all of my feelings on this movie I think will come into play.  Here is what I want.  1) I want Bucky/The Winter Solder to be the sole bad guy fighting for MOST of the entire movie. Keep it simple, and don't let it stray into convoluted .  2) Even though I, as an audience member knows who The Winter Solder, I do not want Cap/Steve Rogers nor do I want S.H.I.E.L.D. to know of his true identity. I want Black Widow and SHIELD to know enough on him and all what they can except for his name.  3) I want Cap and WS to fight for the majority until the climax and/or near the end of the movie and the whole time Steve can't quite put two and two as to who he is. Each time WS is getting the best of Cap until that final fight scene where it all comes down to that moment. I don't want a mere one to two minute scene. I better get at least 8 to 10 to 15 at the most of them fighting all leading up to that one moment when Cap finally best the WS and when he goes to reveal who is underneath the mask. I want to see the shock and feel the emotion on Cap's face as it hits him that he was fighting he best friend the entire time. Which leads me to...  4) I want to see Cap defeat Bucky/the Winter Soldier, but not kill him. In fact after everything I think that because of his nature Cap would still go out of his way to save his friend who just so happens to be his enemies. I think that it would be cool if Cap is carrying Bucky on his back as the building his blowing up behind them rescuing themselves from certain firey deaths.  This is not a spoiler because it hasn't happened yet. This is just what I suspect COULD happen and what I hope to happen for when I go to see it in April. I think that this movie will be a great film and I cannot wait to see it.",5,0,Patrick Shutt,7SlILk2WMTI,0.19691609977324265,2014-02-04 21:18:56,True,True

They were like Batman and Robin. When Cap got frozen in ice (first movie), Bucky was presumed dead also in the explosion. The russians found him, gave him his metal arm for the one he lost, and brainwashed him. They gave him the codename Winter Soldier, and kept him in cryogenic stasis whenever he wasnt on a mission to preserve his age. They used him for dirtywork the govt couldnt do. So what the trailer DOESNT show is if/when Cap will realize its Bucky, and if Cap can restore his memories, and if he will side with Cap after all that happens!!

2014-02-26T17:56:18,"""To build a better world, some times means tearing the old one down.""  That is Progressive ideology. It is a strategy originated from the Fabians of Great Britain, which is what spawned Progressivism in America. Their idea is to tear down our liberty and free way of life that is currently supposed to be guaranteed through our Constitution. They want to create what they think is a better world based on domination and control by the elitists. I am disturbed to find this little bit of Progressive propaganda infiltrated into this film in just little increments. Little by little they nudge us towards unknowing acceptance of the demise of our liberty and freedom. Since the early 1900's Progressives have infiltrated and created influence in every social organization of this nation.  Now it looks like Marvel has been infiltrated too. ",0,0,A.W.R.

To fake Nick Fury's death, as he was gaining a large amount of attention that he didn't really want as an agent of Shield. 2. To make Captain angry at WS, because he just ""killed"" Nick Fury, because the Council that was seen in the Avengers movie believes that WS is a potential threat. 3. To get Captain killed, because after the advanced technologies discovered from the Chitauri invaders, they fell that they have no need for the Avengers anymore (trust me, their wrong), and Cap has expanded on his streak of exploring to find badly hidden weapons of mass destruction, also as seen on the Avengers, and he shared the information with a few choice people, namely Black Widow, who told the council what he had found and how he was planning to spread dissension among the ranks.

2014-03-19T19:23:10,"I don't like the idea where Bucky gets injected with an inferior SSS. That's totally re-writing the comic book origins. But I do have a feeling that this is where Marvel is taking it to, I mean, just look at what they've done with all the other films.  But according to Marvel's background info on Winter Soldier, he was never injected with any kind of SSS.   And the Infinity Formula was not given to him by Nick Fury until much later.  He fell from an exploding airplane, lost his arm from the explosion, then the Russians fished him out of the water. Brainwashed him into a Russian spy and gave him a robotic arm. His robotic arm was upgraded over time, as technology gets more and more advanced, his arm became more advanced as well.  He didn't age because the Russians kept him in Cryogenic chamber when he is not on mission, so that's why he's able to live for 70 years without much aging. And later on the Infinity Formula retarded his aging process but he has to continue to use it or otherwise he would rapidly age.   He never did have any SSS in him but due to the fact that he's been training and fighting along side the Cap for so long, he was extremely skilled in Hand to Hand combat, he learned a lot from the Cap and others.  Even before that, he was a very gifted Scout. And everything about him exponentially increased when he underwent the Russian spy training. He was special in his own right.  I just don't like abusing the SSS formula in such a way. Bucky was almost Cap's equal without the steroids. But as we can see from the trailers, as Winter Soldier was running on the roof top, we see Cap yelling ""He's FAST!"". By the way, this is coming from a guy that could finish a mile run in 73 seconds and he says Winter Soldier was ""FAST"".  So I'm sure they're saying that Bucky also got juiced up.

For me, I only like are Ironman 1 & 2, every other MarvelStudios, movie has had Mediocre & Forgetable. Thor is a Cars remake, Avengers is Dumb Garbage, no plot, no drama, not a single character moment, the dialoges where bad fan fiction, all Action was 100% CGI and there wasnt a single Creative Set Piece, Hulk at the end becomes a Deux Machinima. Ruffalo sucked as Banner, Norton was better, Thor2 & Ironman3 are dumbed too. Cap1 was a weak weak efforth too, another underdeveloped villian (ala Thor2), a unfocused plot (the end should had been more like Sam Raimi's Oz, and less Rambo) So should I watch it or I'm okay skipping it? I like my movies with DEPTH like X-men films (for all hate Fox has on Last Stand, it still has more Plot than DisneyMarvel movies), Raimi Spiderman, Old Superman, and Nolan's Batman, Skyfall... So do it have substance or or is Cap2 another unfunny meaningless joke fest that takes its characters as jokes and I should skip? DOES IT HAVE PLOT? LESS CGI? DOES IT HAVE HEART?

2014-04-05T18:28:58,"This was by far the best of the Marvel cinematic movie films. I hated the first Captain America, i have always loved the character, but the origin story is dull and boring and they didn't do anything to spice it up. That being said, i had no expectations for this movie, but if i did, they would have been blown away. It was truly amazing, by far the most intense and serious of the marvel films.  But it had a lot good going for it. The characters were developed greatly, and i liked how they expanded upon black widow. She actually had purpose in this movie, she was kinda just. . . there, in avengers and in Iron man 2. In this she had a true role in the plot.   Falcon was just downright awesome, and was greatly developed as a character as well. The relationships between Cap, Fury, Falcon, and Black widow were done really nicely, and this movie also expanded on shield and the character of nick fury which was really awesome.   The plot was also pretty complex, not hard to follow, but complex in a way that keeps you interested and entertained throughout.   I also liked how they didn't have the winter soldier as the main focus of this film. He kinda acted as a background threat that was always looming in the air throughout the film. When you think that they have naturalized the threat BAM! The winter soldier shows up and wrecks everyone.  Really awesome movie, definitely go see it. 9/10  ",4,0,Newt Films,7SlILk2WMTI,0.22634803921568625,2014-04-05 18:28:58,False,True

2014-04-09T05:04:12,"This is half-rant half review... but not really a rant as I believe it...  Samuel Jackson plays another angry black guy who talks down to and orders around the white people in this movie... I admit he was great in the Tarantino movies Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Django... why is he now in superhero movies? And also Don Cheadle?! I mean the other black guy they used in this movie was fine, he was a good actor so I am not racist...  There is a scene, (and I personally hate cops and I am white, first off) where Sam Jackson almost gets pulled over by white cops and makes a sarcastic comment (about his lease) and eventually starts shooting at the white policeman and wipes them all out... Now as much as I hate cops, it is crazy that this scene is released in a movie of this magnitude and box office gross... It is the jewish liberal media, but whatever, not a good message to send impressionable youth (it's ok for a black man to shoot hordes of white cops)  As for the movie, action scenes were great, I give it an 8.5, the problem was that the action scenes had way too many close-ups... you could not see the action a lot of times... other than that great action scenes... plot was dull...  I know I have just ended up starting a war with my Samuel Jackson comments, but it is obvious to anyone who observes this movie, Sam Jackson's goal in his character was simply to order around the white subordinates... talk down to them, the bottom line is he does not do well in action movies... I am not racist cause Laurence Fishburne can pull that off well.... again the scene where Sam Jackson shoots all the cops is blasphemy, amazing that was included, and again I hate cops....",0,0,1RonBurgundy1,7SlILk2WMTI,0.008947028423772608,2014-04-09 05:04:12,False,True

2014-04-13T22:21:10,"And for the first time in Marvel movie history, we can feel the fear coming from the lead characters and, from the sound effects in the fight scenes, sense that they faced real danger.  In the film, set after the intergalactic battle that almost destroyed New York in The Avengers, the world has been a more dangerous and problematic place, with airborne mega-drone strikes looming.  To justify Project Insight to the World Council, the argument of “to build a better world you need to tear the old one down” was uttered repeatedly by S.H.I.E.L.D. architects and executives over the course of the movie’s two hours and 16 minutes   Such talk resonates with the foreign policy of George W. Bush, making the movie clearly American, not only because of the product placement for stalwart brands such as Chevrolet and Harley Davidson.  The movie begins with S.H.I.E.L.D. ramrod Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), whose superhero power is probably survival, suspecting schemes, evil plots and backstabbing inside the über-spy agency.  He trusts no one — not even longtime friend and boss Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), the council’s secretary — in a decision that costs him blood and more body damages.  Trust is the last message he passed to Captain America, aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), who when we first meet him in the film is (again) catching up with the modern world after spending decades frozen in suspended animation.   Now, Rodgers has to grapple with the task and put the world back in order as only Captain America can do.  He teams up with the defected Russian spy Natasha Romanoff, aka the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Veterans Anonymous counselor Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), who makes the perfect wingman for Cap.  The chemistry between Rogers and Romanoff is apparent in their snarky banter over trust, friendship and the reason why Rogers hasn’t dated anyone.  As the most wanted person at S.H.I.E.L.D., Rogers has to get back to his old uniform, which he snatches from the Smithsonian Museum (guarded by Marvel creator and one-time Captain America comic scripter Stan Lee in a cameo) and gets entangled in a close-range fight with the formidable Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan).  The twist-laden movie has many pluses that made it a better Marvel movie. During the end credits, don’t leave your seats: The movie gives hints about Joss Whedon’s upcoming The Avengers: Age of Ultron and features the first appearance two more heroes from the Marvel bullpen: Quicksilver and his twin sister, the Scarlet Witch.  Rogers, along with the agency's S.T.R.I.K.E. team and agent Natasha Romanoff, is sent to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from pirates led by mercenary Georges Batroc. Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury. Rogers returns to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, to confront Fury and is briefed about Operation Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Fury, unable to decrypt Romanoff's recovered data, becomes suspicious about Insight.  On his way to rendezvous with Maria Hill, Fury is ambushed by assailants led by a mysterious assassin called the Winter Soldier. Fury escapes to Rogers' apartment, and warns Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised. After handing Rogers a flash drive containing data from the ship, Fury is gunned down by the Winter Soldier. Fury dies in surgery, and Hill recovers the body. The next day, senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by the agency, Rogers meets with Romanoff. Using data in the flash drive they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola. Zola reveals that since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after World War II, HYDRA has secretly operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos in the hope that humanity would willingly surrender its freedom in exchange for security. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker.  Rogers and Romanoff enlist the help of Sam Wilson, a former military pararescueman whom Rogers befriended, and acquire his powered ""Falcon"" wingpack. Deducing S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jasper Sitwell is a HYDRA mole, they force him to divulge that Zola developed a data-mining algorithm that can identify individuals who might become future threats to HYDRA's plans. The Insight Helicarriers will sweep the globe, using satellite-guided guns to eliminate these individuals. En route to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson are ambushed by the Winter Soldier and Sitwell is thrown into oncoming traffic. During the fight, Rogers recognizes the Winter Soldier as Bucky Barnes, his World War II comrade, before being captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. Hill rescues them and leads them to a safehouse where Fury, who had faked his death, is waiting with plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips.  After members of the World Security Council arrive for the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers reveals HYDRA's plot to everyone at the Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised as one of the Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock access to S.H.I.E.L.D's database so Romanoff can expose HYDRA by leaking classified information. After a struggle, Fury shoots Pierce dead. Meanwhile, Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controllers, but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels shoot down each other. Rogers falls from the Helicarrier as it crashes into the Triskelion, where Wilson fights double agent Rumlow, the S.T.R.I.K.E. team's leader. Rogers lands in the Potomac River and is rescued by the Winter Soldier, who then disappears. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of HYDRA's remaining cells as Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee. Rogers and Wilson decide to track down the Winter Soldier with information from Romanoff on the Winter Soldier program.  In a mid-credits scene, Baron von Strucker, at a HYDRA lab, proclaims the ""age of miracles"" has begun as scientists examine an energy-filled scepter and two prisoners: one with superhuman speed, the other with telekinetic powers.

Well, that is silly.  They were on a moving train.  What was the Cap supposed to do?  Jump into the cliff with Bucky, saying, Eh, you know what?  It's OK.  We'll work our way out of this ditch, together…. No, but Cap was like, OK, Bucky did not make it.  But we still got a date with Red Skull.  So, c'mon you guys…  That said, long hair I think only looks OK on guys with oval faces, or strong jaw bones.  But Bucky is like cube-head, and frankly, looks ridiculous with long-hair.  He needs a haircut, badly…. Superhero movies, are kind of ridiculous, but they ought to appear like superhero movies.  In this one, you have the Falcon, who has hi-tech gear, and Bucky, with a mechanical arm… Oooh!  More tech guys, rather than guys with super-powers.  Also, in this one, Cap. appears to be less super, and more athletic.  So the trend is, forget superpowers, use tech, and workout a lot.  … This, I found was rather boring.  The first movie, was better.  Maybe if the Winter Soldier did not look ridiculous, and was a real supervillain, with believable superpowers…. but this… looks like one of Stark Industries rejected developmental projects.",0,0,rowdy yeats,7SlILk2WMTI,0.0765432098765432,2014-09-13 18:18:03,False,False

Agent 47 (Video game version) vs Captain America... 2 humans, designed to be perfect, both are stronger, smarter, and faster than normal humans... Although, one is a perfect soldier, the other... Is a perfect Assassin... 1 friend of mine said that 47 could bash the Caps head with a pipe, and make it look like an accident... Another said that 47 wouldn't get the chance to do that because Captain America is always on the alert... The friend that said said 47 would win, replied to that with: When it comes to Agent 47, no matter how alert, or reckless anyone is, he will kill them if he wants to/needs to bad enough.

Late at night when most people on the ship were asleep, Peggy, wearing a white night gown with her gray hair flowing in the wind, walked to the back of the ship. She held a necklace in her hand and looked at it for a moment and then threw it into the ocean. The big jewel in the necklace had a glow to it. It's believed to be an Infinity Stone. Peggy is then seen laying in her bed. It appears she may have died in her sleep. You then see B&W images of the battles of WWII. Also in B&W, you see a young Peggy walking into the bar from the first Captain America film. The bar is filled with deceased soldiers including Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) and Captain America's squad The Howling Commandos. Everyone is drinking, laughing and having a good time. Peggy approaches a large staircase. At the top of the staircase is a young Steve Rogers. He turns around and smiles at her. Peggy walks up the stairs to be with him.

Combine that with Tony Stark's big role in Cap 3 and it's increased my excitement for Civil War and Infinity War immensely. I actually won't miss Whedon, because even though he's a good director, I think the guys who are directing CA3 and Avengers 3 and 4 have a better understanding of the dramatic tension that the universe deserves at the moment.
