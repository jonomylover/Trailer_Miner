2016-12-04T17:20:02,"I think Marvel is more critically reviewed because it just doesn't appeal to the comic fanatics where they see their character on the big screen and it's all serious and with cool action scenes. Marvel movies like to have fun with their movies and have parts in which you can laugh at all the while giving their characters personality.  Their villains may be bland but they only last one movie. I mean I liked Ultron and hate how he's gone so soon but it's a formula that Marvel follows. It likes to focus on the likable characters and use the villains to build them up and I feel Thanos will be the most memorable villain cause he'll be the final boss. Also, everyone likes Loki and he's been in a lot of movies. I feel like if DC stopped trying to force movies that comic fanatics want to see and have a larger story like Marvel does with its movies it may do better. But Idk I just like Marvel better because I can actually enjoy the dialogue and not just wait bored for another action sequence.",1,0,Drake Stallworth,2cv2ueYnKjg,0.1360576923076923,2016-12-04 17:20:02,True,True

It's not a guardians story, it's a story that more focuses more on one character and the guardians are just tagging along for the adventure. 80% of this movie is jokes and while some are hilarious it gets a bit overkill. This feels like a filler movie for the inbetween  wait to Infinity War. This suffers from the more generic marvel movie villian syndrome as well. All in all guardians is a fun ride  but it's not as good as i was expecting, it doesn't really expand much on the depth of the characters.",54,14,Jamie Hill,2cv2ueYnKjg,0.16642857142857145,2017-04-25 08:23:32,True,True

2017-05-05T05:45:57,The blue man with the arrow (Yondu) dies in the end in order to save Starlord from his evil dad that is trying to wipe out the universe. Gamora's sister Nebula comes back and tries to kill her but they end up becoming friends and help each other defeat Starlord's father. Yondu's crew goes mutiny in the beginning of the film but Yondu and Rocket Raccoon manage to escape with the help of one man that is still loyal. Gamora and Starlord are finally officially a thing. Starlord's father implanted the tumor in Starlord's mother. He also killed many of his own children because he was looking for one that had the power he eventually found in Starlord. The Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 is a great movie. I highly recommend it.,0,0,Adolf Hitler,2cv2ueYnKjg,0.1091025641025641,2017-05-05 05:45:57,False,True

2017-05-17T06:27:50,"My quick review: This is nowhere near as good a movie as Guard of Galaxy 1. Some of the visuals are even better than part 1. The first half of the movie dragged on. The main problem was the dialogue was a lot of bathroom humor and goofy bad jokes (and I know this franchise is supposed to have some goofy humor, but it was wayyy overdone) Some of the jokes, and I could care less about censorship or adult humor, were downright disgusting, as in gross. The second half had some excellent action scenes but the action scenes in part 1 seemed better choreographed or something. I would rate it a C+ or B- and part 1 I would give an A. Plot and characters were all over the place. Even for a purposefully light funny and goofy action movie, the jokes mostly fell flat. Worth seeing but nowhere near as cohesive as part 1. Dialogue in action sci fi and comic book movies seems to be getting more and more off-the-wall and silly every year. Every scene does not have to be a snappy dumb one-liner.

I want to go big game hunting but know it's morally questionable. So I'm going to split the difference and go big game raping.  I'm doing a big Hollywood film adaptation of The Giving Tree with a happy ending - the tree grows back and gives the kid a blowjob.  Oh, I forgot to tell you guys - last night I did a reading with a convicted pedophile.  Just made a joke about ass-raping my friend when she was asleep.  I like it when little boys touch me in my silly place. Shhh!  The Expendables was so manly I fu**ed the shit out of the little p*ssy boy next to me! The boys ARE back in town!  Three Men and a Baby They Had Sex With  ""Eagle Snatches Kid"" is what I call it when I get lucky.  This hotel shower is the weakest ever. Felt like a three year old was peeing on my head.  This may be the plant version of adopting a damaged 12 year old girl who steals your money and accuses you of molesting her.  The best thing about being raped is when you're done being raped it's like, ""Whew, this feels great, not being raped!""  Laughter is the best medicine. That;s why I laugh at people with AIDS.  The first time I masturbated to Justin Bieber it was a joke, but now I can't stop! He's like jerkoff crack!  Mary Matthews just told me a story about how a monkey jerked off to completion on a kid on the set of Max Keeble's Big Move.  Honesty's the best policy. Tell your 3 year old you're thinking of me when I'm ****ing 3PO. He'll appreciate it when older.
