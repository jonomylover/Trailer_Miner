Their vision is wrong, hiring foreign A-list actors aren't going to help one bit, them looking out of place will put off fans no matter how big they are, a great foreign director would have served better.  Zhang Yimou is great, he's got his own unique style, sometimes he breaks into foreign box offices, sometimes not, but he should stick to it without the need of foreign superstars. We just need more directors like him with their own identity it doesn't always need to be fantasy or artsy with the colours.  Since Chinese cinema are saturated with fantastical elements, maybe they should give a more realistic but just as dramatic epic a try.  Basically no Wuxia and no try-hard action like overcomplicated showy manoeuvres (like horses running on armies of men holding their shield up), just something dramatic in the realm of believabilty.  Like for instance, a director should have their own interpretation of the rescue of Liu Bei's son by Zhao Yun by having him breaking into lines of low quality troops with a unit of his personal crack guards(Alexander-Darius), *NOT* singlehandedly Dynasty-warrioring it by killing 20 men with one swoop of his spear.

So technically, Great Wall didn't perform its functional role.   After Ming dynasty took China back from Mongolians, the emperor started to rebuild the Great Wall far southern to its original border.
