Seems like these days all we need is some lame ass comedies with beautiful Channing or CGI movies with pretty Chris.I have grown with classic action movies like Cobra, Tango&Cash, Rambo, Terminator, Showdown in the Little Tokyo and more and I can't accept weak pretty boy CGI movies that we all are begining to love. There's no heart in those movies. Ok, old-school action movies are violent, but there's so much heart and so much work behind the scenes, training and talent! These guys are legends!

You got Wesley Snipes a guy who is trying to salvage his once good acting career. Mel Gibson who is trying to get back into box office status.

2014-08-10T14:21:49,"  We live in an era where even something that should be a relaxation, such as watching a movie, became something that's more of a burden than anything else. People need to realise this particular franchise is made for the sake of it, not to live up to the expectations of some scumbags who watch movies just to see where they'll find something bad in them or where they'll find a mistake. This franchise is made for people who appreciate the ''movie'' for what it stands for - fun and for nostalgic people. To insure that, it uses the forever-expanding ''golden age of pop culture'' movie legends, a normal plot which is made the way it is to give the audience luxury to focus more on all those legends sharing screen time together rather than the plot itself. It's not meant to be a mind bending, mapped out pacing, unpredictable ''new century'' movie, it's meant to be just the opposite and that's the beauty of it. As long as they're enjoying each other and having fun on set all together, it transfers to the screen. I feel sorry for people who can't see that, but on the other hand, I'm not surprised since we live in a time where is better and/or easier to be fake, artificial and factory-made rather than true..",0,0,jimmyleppard6,4xD0junWlFc,0.030594405594405592,2014-08-10 14:21:49,False,True

Yes, there's one born every minute, but you're supposed to offer something in return — entertainment or spectacle — when you empty a sucker's wallet. Expendables 3 might be too little too soon, but in all the what-the-hell-happened analysis, the repetitive non-sense plot, the weak screenplay, for a lack of a better word, has ground down to near nothingness and last but not least, watering down the action to get a more family-friendly rating, in other words, the PG rating, are the main factors that made this movie fail.",0,0,The Boxer,4xD0junWlFc,-0.04917929292929295,2014-08-21 22:02:02,False,True

Bullet to the head was like an updated version of Cobra, except boring. He seem to recover with Escape Plan which I thought was a solid film. But then he just completely dialed in a performance on Grudge Match which looked good on paper but was played by two very tired looking stars. Now this movie comes out... Jesus.  My tolerance level has been admittedly set too high for some of Sly's stuff, but Expendables 3 was THE biggest pile of garbage I have EVER seen him do. He didn't even dial in a performance. He slept walked the whole thing. To call the plot mindless is to give it WAAAAY too much credit. That wasn't even written on the back of a napkin. More like an inscribed notion on road kill. And now he wants to revisit Rambo? He's really burned out his welcome on the whole 80's retro hero front. The man is nearly 70 years old and doing a Rambo movie now? Please Sly...

In the same day, as Ross & his friends celebrating, welcome the new members on the team.  In that same day in the middle of the afternoon. A woman is having tea & reading a magazine. Sees her daughter swimming in the pool doing her laps to keep herself in shape. As she finishes & exits out of the pool, grabs a towel.  She dries herself off and ask her mother that she curious of when Conrad be coming back soon.  Her mother tells her. She hasn't heard from him today.  Must be caught up with some more art dealing. He gets pretty busy in the business world. Then a man walks toward her who works for them, the daughter sees him & tells her mother an unfortunate news.   Her mother takes the news shocking & drops her tea cup, it smashes into the ground.  shouts out her name.  The daughter runs towards her & holds on to her mother, she cries on her shoulder. She wonders of what happen, her mother tells her (sobbing) in tears.  Conrad is not coming home. He's been killed.  Herself is in shocked, Into her eyes a single tear drop. then her eyes filled with anger. She demands to know who killed him.  Weeks later after they had a private funeral for him. She assumes control of Conrad business. In her private gym in her workout. In her sparring sessions & keeping her martial arts of Taewondo.  She beats the hell out of her spar partners.  One of her employees is walking to her gym with a briefcase. As she gets ready for another sparring round.  One of her lieutenants tells her. that one of her sources has found the information she's asked for and the package has arrived. She looks & sees him, takes off her gloves. walks to him.  Then he opens the briefcase & hands her a file from the C.I.A. which it contains the profiles of the team & the man who killed Conrad.  She looks through it.  Then she puts a price tags on their heads. But she wants Barney Ross alive, so she can kill him for herself.  She puts together her own team. Day later while Ross & his team in a middle finishing up a job overseas.  They get ambushed by another team, barely got away. couple of her team mates gets wounded.  They get stateside, while they get resupplied & rested.  Barney gets visit from Drummer, tells him there's a price on them.  Barney asked who order it, Drummer gives him a file of a young woman that has taken over Conrad business & continuing selling, trading black arms dealing.   Barney looks at the pics of her & see her name.  ""Alektra Stonebanks"" she is Conrad's daughter.   She's out for revenge.  So Barney & his team of ultimate badasses gear up to fight for survival & take it into a whole new level.  As they take on a team of ""Assassin's"" against ""The Expendables"".",0,0,wildmann23,4xD0junWlFc,-0.01137631137631136,2015-03-25 03:29:44,False,False

At least Mel and Antonio Banderas were the only ones who looked like they were having fun with their roles. We don't go into an Expendables movie to see these young morons that we don't care about! We wanna see the older, veteran badasses! And directors need to stop giving roles to that IDIOT Kellan Lutz. Seriously, that talentless asshole literally pollutes EVERYTHING he touches. STOP GIVING THAT CLOWN WORK!! Ronda Rousey could've played an actual character, but instead she's just a role--the token female member whose only function is to rebuff the frat-guys who try to hit on her and say ""Men..."". The main cast--Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture and Terry Crews--are completely shafted into the background; Wesley Snipes has all of about 5 minutes of screen time, and you completely forget that Arnold is in it, somewhere back there in the corner. Look Sly, we love you, but you're not Robert DeNiro. Stop expecting us to take you seriously and treat you like him! Stick to what you do best, and we'll watch you.

The star cast will be international and hence appeal to a global audience at a personal level.

In an interview with Den of Geek, Chan explained his disappearance on the movie's third sequel, ""This morning I did hear - the office called - Sly [Stallone] wants me for 'Expendables 4.' I said, 'Okay.' Because they already asked me to be in two and three, but I refused. Well, I didn't refuse, but I said, 'Sly, can't we just do you and me? Not just a bunch of people and me only coming out for five minutes.' Because then the audience is, 'Oh!' And then I'm gone."" According to Stallone, they plan on adding more celebrities from around the world and not just Americans. The star cast will be international and hence appeal to a global audience at a personal level. ""We always wanted to work with Jackie, but due to a shortage of central roles, an arrangement could not be made. However, in the upcoming installment, we will surely try to bring him on board. For The Expendables 4, we are trying to reduce the number of stars and increase their individual screen time. Let's see how that goes!"" Stallone said. Besides the leak of Expendables 3 before its arrival on theaters in August 2015, many are still wanting to see more on The Expendables 4.",0,0,Sasa Mrdj,4xD0junWlFc,0.1660135841170324,2015-06-15 13:13:30,False,False

And the other guys but I was happy to see Antonio banderas in the movie honesty all the characters in the film are good actors but those new guys just I dont know it's not there style to be in the film cause we need to see in every expendables films old characters that's the only reason but atleast thank God the film was still nice.,1,0,The Entertainer,4xD0junWlFc,0.3498737373737374,2019-08-22 20:15:55,False,False
