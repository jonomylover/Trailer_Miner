In the last 1/3 of the book, and in countless TV interviews of Louie Z himself (which you can find on YouTube) and in his own best-selling autobiography from the 1950s, Louie said the *Big Picture point* of his story is simply this --- that the power of *forgiveness*, born out of faith and a *love* for one’s fellow human beings, is the most powerful gift to heal the souls of victims and perpetrators. Louie said this is what *saved* his life AFTER he got home to the U.S. when the war ended --- it saved him from *PTSD*, saved him from *alcoholism*, saved his *marriage*, saved him from taking out his *pain* on others & drove him to *give back* to his community and country.

While it is true the Japanese soldiers of World War II slaughtered millions of people, Chinese, Koreans, southeast Asians, etc. It is also true that our very own US Military has also slaughtered millions of people over the history of our country and there were those who were no less brutal on our side as well.  I have worked and lived with the Japanese people, and I know you cannot blame the Japanese commenting on here the film is a lie or that Japan did not start the war. If you want to blame something, blame the Japanese education system that has failed to teach the Japanese people of today the realities of the atrocities committed during WW2 from the Massacre at Nanjing to the so-called “comfort women” the Japanese soldiers forced into prostitution during the War.  The Japanese politicians who continue to minimize or deny what really occurred are doing nothing to heal old wounds and I don’t blame the Koreans or Chinese for getting upset about it. I know many Japanese people who, once they are fully made aware of the realities of what happened during the war are truly ashamed of what their military did during World War 2 as I am of mine once I learned the truth. I feel there should be more of an equal telling of what really happened during that time. Hollywood should make movies to show the hell on Earth the USA unleashed on the Japanese at Hiroshima and Nagasaki or how our great American government took Japanese Americans from their homes and business and marched them at gunpoint into internment camps in the West. Anyone who thinks the dropping of the atomic bombs was justified, go to the Atomic Memorial museum in Hiroshima and then tell me how justified this was.

The Japanese slaughtered over a hundred thousand chinese, vietnamese, koreans, and other east asian countries. We had to get involved due to their country becoming an extreme xenophobic war mongering machine quickly using imperialist tactics. The Canadians and Brits are already involved a few years before. The Chinese are forced to fight as one against a common enemy.  Japan wouldn't surrender against any forces. The fire bombings killed many more than the A-bomb. We had either a choice to wipe Japan off the map by long term firebombings, land invade which would result in millions of american and japanese deaths, letting the soviets literally slaughter them, or influence Tojo into halting his troops by demonstrating a force of power that would prove we weren't bluffing which was the A-Bomb.   Before you Japanese say the A-Bombs were horrible, think about the slow burning of Tokyo, Kyoto, etc. by the fire bombs.   Before you Americans say the Japanese were horrible, think of how propaganda played into the minds of influencing the Japanese to fear everything, enough to committing suicide rather than face the americans.   Understand that war is hell.

They fought to the last man in nearly every engagement. The bombs saved lives, although people can argue over exactly how many. But it continued taking lives long after the bomb had been dropped. Only in the recent past has the radioactivity dropped back down to the accepted normal. The other problem here is the bombs that ended WW2 started the Cold War, which was always a knife's edge away from worldwide disaster.   The America shoulders most of the blame for the Cold War, or at least for starting it. A long procession of one-upping between US and NATO and  Russia make it more of a chicken-or-the-egg argument, but there quite a few cases of the US being the proverbial bad guy.  Cuban Missile Crisis comes to mind, as it was caused by the US placing missiles in Turkey. The first use of nuclear weapons also rests firmly on the US, which was also   Japanese POW camps were the worst Hell's humans could create. Germany treated their prisoners in their death camps better (until they finally killed them in mass exterminations) than Japan did.  All of the above is really just pointless. You want pure evil, look at Joseph Stalin. Made Hitler look like an amateur. Hitler needed gas chambers and concentration camps to kill 6 million people. Stalin did that by creating a famine that didn't actually exist, and that was just in 2 years. Not including casualties of war, low estimates puts Stalin's tally at 20 million, and on the high side, 40 million.  And they still prop him up as a hero.",0,0,AgnotologyTV,kk1M_HwmFMM,-0.07421340388007053,2015-01-26 00:56:12,False,True

2020-01-17T10:43:19,"My great-uncle was a Canadian infantryman captured by the Japanese in Hong Kong on Christmas Day, 1941. The Canadians fought as hard as they could under the circumstances, but there were only two battalions of them, along with the British who numbered not many more against a battle-hardened Japanese division who had just finished slaughtering tens of thousands of civilians in China. My great-uncle never said a word about the torture or the deprivations he went through, suffice to say he couldn't look at Rice and gave me a pretty good blast a s*** for buying a Toyota. I did however had a chance to read my great uncle's diary after he died, and I have never looked at a Japanese person the same way since.

2020-06-02T14:08:18,これは日本人見るべき。 As a Japanese students I’m upset that these things are not taught in a school. But to make sure why it’s not is not because teachers doesn’t want to teach them but they don’t know it or they don’t feel the necessaries to teach them because most of Japanese stay in our country and don’t have problem not knowing about it. I remember being upset hearing what Japan had done from my friend from China and Vietnam. I will not apologize because I think that makes nothing changed but I will alway remember this and try to do something that makes Japanese education different!,0,0,Life is Good,kk1M_HwmFMM,0.16666666666666666,2020-06-02 14:08:18,False,False
