Also, there was this conversation on here about black women having a whole lot of more opportunities than the black male. That's complete and utter crap. We as black people are always discriminating each other when we''re suppose to be caring for another. Name how many black women got the chance to grace the Oscar stage as oppose to the black male. That's all I got to say about that, but seriously people. My generation does not care about race. It's true that most industries are ran by the whites, but they are the majority. We accept all.

I still remember the story to this day, because of its quirks and good plotline.

Look I get it with the whole parents are meant to parent the kid and make sure they know wrong from right but as much as parents might do, you cant protect the kids if society itself doesnt do its part. If someone has a kid in the rough part of a city, theres only so much you can protect the kid, the society around him/her will influence them badly. And this future generation are eventually meant to be mature enough to run this world and make it a better place as well as look after us so you cant say its not your prob if you dont have kids. Its what a functioning society is all about. Now i have more respect for adult performers with regards to that kind of stuff, rather than people like Rihanna who tries to dodge responsibility whilst still marketing to kids and being a ""role model"". It might seem  unfair i know because shes a grown women who can do what she like but she chose this situation cos she wants that money (cant blame her) but she should accept the responsiblity  that comes with it. I get that its mostly down to parents, but you are just silly if you think society isn't  involved to a degree (and therefore, things like pop stars and role models also  have a role to play).",0,1,Sara Mahjabin,MyqZf8LiWvM,0.02933057280883367,2015-03-12 15:01:34,True,True

2015-03-27T21:20:43,"I am white, and I think there should be more films with heroes/main characters that have a different skin color besides white. Most of the time, the heroes/main characters are white and the people of different skin colors are depicted as side characters, which is really sad. *Make sure you click read more!* I want to see more heroes/main characters of different skin colors. That way, people of other skin colors besides white can have a main character they can relate to. I really don't see why almost all of the heroes/main characters of films are white. :/  I watched this movie a half-hour or two ago and I loved it! I thought both Tip and Oh were great characters. They both felt alone, but when they met, they worked together to fit in. Oh was goofy and friendly, and he just wanted to make friends. Being Autistic, I can relate to Oh, sometimes I just want to make friends, but people just don't understand. Tip was a young girl who couldn't fit in with her class. I really liked Tip because she looked like a real girl and didn't wear designer clothing. I'd say she was a strong female. In the end, they managed to fit in, but I am not saying how because that would ruin the movie. :P  Also, before you post anything rude, this is only my perspective.

2015-03-28T02:03:11,"Personally, this movie deserves better reviews. First off, I want to start with the pros if this movie. (no spoilers) First iff, the climax alone was clever, artsitic, and just amazing.cThere is a true sense if emotion and excitment that really captivates the viewer. The climax alone was alot better then other movies. There will always be that ONE movie that ends to soon. One example may be Monsters University. Or there may be movies with so much hype built up but with so little answers revealed in the end like Big Hero 6. HOME does a fine job of keeping your heart on the race. Once you think the movie is over, it takes a U-turn and just gets CRAZY! And that alone probably sold me out because it was amazing. The 3D was also swell, especially with this art style. Speaking of that, this movie has an amazing art style. It is so much more diverse and imaginative then the water colors foung in other movies like ""The Croods"" or ""HTTYD1&2."" It takes skill for the same developers of both movies to change so drastically. What the climax succeeds on is what the Spongebob Movie fell to realize. In Sponge Out of Water, the climax with the super heros was so aren. There was no reason to put superheros in there, and the climax in general just felt like fighting a punchbag dummy that won't fall down. You just want the fight to end. Everything was so predictable because of the trailers. Home fixes such a problem becuase it knows at that point the veiwer is craving more, so they pump it out. It is so thrilling, I sometimes have the urge to go watch the movie again becuase of the climax, despite only JUST coming back from seeing it. The characters are well developed as well, which unlike other movies, actually progresses the plot along instead of pausing (most of the time) Now for the cons. I really do not like the road trip scene that much. While I do find it as a necessity for the plots to move along, there is quite some filler. The dancing scene in particular seems to go on FOREVER. The beggining in general also feels pretty fast. While I do like movies that cut to the chase, I can find it hard for young viewers to catch onto what really is going on. (SPOILER ALERT) That scene where Oh invites the entire universe to Earth seems rushed. Kyle, ( or whatever the police guys name is) jumped out of nowhere blaming Oh. WAY TO FAST. (End of spoilers) Overall, with the dynamic characters, engaging storyline, and humorous attractions, I think it is safe to say that this may be my favorite movie as of March 2015. I must admit, with all the reviews, I felt hesitated to watch this movie. Now seeing the sheer thrill that this movie offers makes me only more excited on where future CGI movies like Inside Out will expierement with next. And if you have known me for a while, I review things critically. For a Dreamworks movie to get ""the best movie"" title from me is sure enough a reason to go watch this movie as fast as you posssibly can.

It seems Dreamworks animation is becoming more and more geared towards younger kids... understandable because animation is often associated with children, but about 80% of the audience when i watched it were adults (most of which without kids), and it seems Dreamworks would understand this and leave more in-jokes for adults, like they used to.  Look at the first couple of ""Shrek"" movies and perhaps the first ""Madagascar"" movie and then look at ""Home"", the ""Shrek"" movies were great for both kids and adults, not to say that ""Home"" isn't, but the difference shows.  When i was younger, i always thought of Dreamworks as the mature studio and Pixar as the kiddie-fare, but now it is the other way around.

Dreamworks should not try to be like Disney and keep the ridiculousness to a subtle degree. 5. Appealing to today's kids generation (8-14) I suppose, but not to the people who grew up with the animation studio and enjoyed its slightly mature themes and motif. Don't like it when these types of studios market to mostly kids even though the content is mostly appealing to the young adults and late teens, especially with dreamworks.
