The story, singing, music, and dancing flowed flawlessly together in that film.  They only broke out into song when it was absolutely necessary.  But anyway, I digress.

Today I was lucky to watch, eventually, and what a disappointment! The storyline was more than far-fetched, the acting was - with a few exceptions - really bad, and so was the singing. But the biggest diappointment was - sorry to say that - Cher. What the hell! With no facial features left after countless plastic sugeries and tons of make-up, she looked like a ghoul. She used to be one of my favorite actresses, but gosh...she should definitely stop! It was good to see the members of the ""old"" cast though, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, Pierce Brosnan, Amanda Seyfried and especially the two ladies from hell, ravishing Christine Baranski and ever-grumpy Julie Walters - they really brought the house down and eventually made the movie a mediocre evening's entertainment.

2020-04-03T01:38:02,"This trailer is so misleading. All of the stuff about her being pregnant and feeling close to her mom doesn't happen until the final act of the movie, here it's displayed as the main plot and the reason she's reminiscing about her mother's past. She also asks in the trailer ""I never did ask you guys, what happened when you met my mother?"" this was an edited line for the trailer, she never said this in the movie. What she did say was asking Rosie what happened between her and Bill (because they were broken up for some reason).  So then why were we seeing flashbacks to Donna's past? We just... kinda were. It would've made more sense if it was how it was displayed in the trailer as Sophie seeking out information about Donna, but that never happened.   ""We can't tell anyone about the baby yet"" was another edited line. The real line was ""We didn't tell anyone yet"" and it was a really short joke about how news spread so fast about her being pregnant, there was never a plot about trying to keep the baby secret.  Also what we see of Cher in the trailer, where they're framing her as a main supporting character of the movie the way they would frame Rosie or any other character with at least 20 minutes of screentime, yeah we get maybe like, a few more minutes of Cher in the movie. That's really it. She also doesn't show up until the final act. Same thing with Billy and Harry. They're framed here as main supporting characters, yet they also don't show up until the final act. And even still, with the small amount of screentime they had, they had way more than Cher did. To give you perspective of how little screentime they had, they had to re use a scene twice within the same minute in this trailer due to not having enough screentime of them together. 0:35 and 0:41",0,0,whatever dani does,nd4cLL_MP7M,0.042638888888888886,2020-04-03 01:38:02,False,False
