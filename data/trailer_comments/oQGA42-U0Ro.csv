Making people aware of the things that go on in secret, make it ""normal"" so when they start doing their satanic spells in the open Noone will fight it. Ever wondered why lately we've had all these satanists(aka ""atheists"" who still coincidentally believe in worshipping the transgender freak baphomet) these people have been shoved in everyone's throats on the news and many other articles. In the film you'll see masonic/satanic symbolisms like pentagrams, the evil hand, some dumb girl doing the 666 sign with both hands supposedly signifying the kids glasses, you'll see goats(because that's not reperencing baphomet who just happened to also be a goat, oh wait, it is), pyramids with eyes in the centre(both reversed and singular, referencing the law of reversals), devil faces, creepy sexual lines of dialogue ""come toss me one"" from a CHILD WTF, dragons (another god that some of these mentally ill people worship), sun worship, skull symbols representing the secret society and the obsessions with death, magic 8 balls to really drive the desensitisation train home. Be aware of these things, as the longer we do nothing about these force feeding of their satanism, the more it'll come into the open and before you know it your children will go missing and be  sacrificed. And if you think I'm joking just research all these symbols, particularly Alistair crowleys works and you'll see they aren't in this movie as a coincidence. They want to bring their mysticism and sick practices to the open and be as depraved and evil legally. And we let it happen, hundred years ago these bastards would be burnt at the stake.",2,2,Wake da **** up people,oQGA42-U0Ro,-0.11190476190476188,2019-01-05 03:47:59,False,False

His novels were eerie, gothic fare illustrated by the inimitable Edward Gorey. Yes they were geared to youth/young adult and so weren't full of sex, swearing and gratuitous gore, but they *were* 100% dark, gothic horror/mystery; very much in the vein of M. R. James. Of course no movie is exactly like its source (and that's fine) but this bright, colorful art direction and cheap childish ""humor"" is literally the *antithesis* of the original book and its art style! It's way past due for any Bellairs novel to hit the big screen, but I can't help but be disappointed that they sucked the very soul out of his work and made it into this silly, campy, cartoony crap instead. It's lost all the creepy atmosphere and style that was so much a part of what made it great. Sigh. Maybe someday someone will remake/reboot this properly. We can only hope.",0,0,N.
