This is not the case. if anything this is a step backwards. Personally I do not think they should have taken the direction with using a commercial soundtrack and i think they should have stuck with a composer for the films score. This music cheapens the film and makes it like yet another pathetic francise and brand name. I never liked Hemsworth in movies, I dont like him in Thor. Same with K stewart, never liked any of those twilight films, but absolutely loved Snow white and the huntsmen. everything about it was great. I loved Malleficiant equally to.

Also the weird tentacle things at the end. But the mirror and the gold looked super awesome (though I really liked the gothic palate of the first film) Like, the first movie was so visually stunning I hope they don't screw this up. Also who wrote the screenplay and who's directing? Cuz the first movie put all the really cool scenes in the trailer then left us with like 2 hours of boring meandering through the woods, I would really hope that doesn't happen again.

2015-11-19T14:57:01,"The fantastical world of Snow White and the Huntsman expands to reveal how the fates of The Huntsman Eric and Queen Ravenna are deeply and dangerously intertwined. Chris Hemsworth and Oscar¬Æ winner Charlize Theron return to their roles in The Huntsman Winter‚Äôs War, an epic action-adventure in which they are joined by Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain, as well as director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan. Producer Joe Roth (Maleficent, Alice in Wonderland) once again leads the team in a breathtaking new tale nested in the legendary saga.  Long before the evil Queen Ravenna (Theron) was thought vanquished by Snow White‚Äôs blade, she watched silently as her sister, Freya (Blunt), suffered a heartbreaking betrayal and fled their kingdom. With Freya‚Äôs ability to freeze any enemy, the young ice queen has spent decades in a remote wintry palace raising a legion of deadly huntsmen‚Äîincluding Eric (Hemsworth) and warrior Sara (Chastain)‚Äîonly to find that her prized two defied her one demand: Forever harden your hearts to love.  When Freya learns of her sister‚Äôs demise, she summons her remaining soldiers to bring the Magic Mirror home to the only sorceress left who can harness its power. But once she discovers Ravenna can be resurrected from its golden depths, the wicked sisters threaten this enchanted land with twice the darkest force it‚Äôs ever seen. Now, their amassing army shall prove undefeatable‚Ä¶unless the banished huntsmen who broke their queen‚Äôs cardinal rule can fight their way back to one another.",0,0,"25,000 Subscribers Without Any Video Challenge",_W65ndip7MM,0.07554112554112553,2015-11-19 14:57:01,True,True

2015-11-23T02:47:33,"I am a little bit confused. It's both sequelprequel or nothing. Let me explain first. So yeah it seems like it's a PREQUEL - because Ice Queen forms a party to get the Mirror, and you can see young Hemsworth and his wife (I guess she will be killed by the Ice Queen etc.) As for me, at this point it is the story of what happened to Huntsman before the first movie. Then it looks like it's a SEQUEL - because you see Ice Queen resurrecting Ravenna from the Mirror and also she told ""I've missed you"" to Huntsman. Okay and now - My confusion starts at the end of trailer when you see one of the dwarves say something like ""Basically we have to kill two evil sisters and their army?"" and you can see Huntsman's wife around. I don't understand it then. How can it be a sequel when wife is alive and attacked Ravenna and how can it be a prequel when Ravenna says 'hello i've missed you' to Huntsman....Or maybe Ice Queen resurrects Ravanna from the future but then it would have no sense because there would be another Ravenna living somewhere else.

This movie is about the snow queen who's child dies so she wants to rid the world of love. That is by far the dumbest villain motivation I have heard in awhile. It doesn't even make any sense. The fact that this movie even got made doesn't even make any sense to me. The plot line is thin with nothing new. The characters are one dimensional and the romance they have with one another especially Chris Hemsworth and his love interest is a joke in the film. This movie also can't decide if it wants to be a prequel, sequel, or a reboot which is laughable at times. The ending has a plot twist which I won't spoil but it was the most predictable plot twist that I've probably seen from a movie in a couple of years. This movie is as bad as it gets and isn't even enjoyable to watch. I have seen almost every movie this year and even I enjoyed God's of Egypt more then this. At least I could laugh in that movie from how bad it was. Don't see this cause you'd be wasting your time with this movie. This movie has no redeeming qualities so I won't even try to look for one. Fuck this movie and Fuck that hollywood thinks they can make this cash grab of a movie because they think their audience is going to support this.

They cry out for privacy in the bedroom and then publicly announce their sexuality, demand tolerance but deny others the very same virtue, they claim to be nothing more than innocent victims but victimize anyone with a dissenting opinion, claim that they only want equal treatment, but in reality they constantly crave negative attention and demand a celebration of their lifestyle, they wallow in vanity and pride, insist that ""tolerance"" and ""acceptance"" are synonymous words, and their claims that the ""homosexual"" family is on par with the ""heterosexual"" family is mainly a form of display.
