We have the 21 century millennial white male in the Banks brother, simpering, weak and inept. 3. The sister, by contrast is strong and, of course, liberal and, I assume, a feminist. 4. The nasty white previous generation male lawyer, full of entitlement and arrogance with his black side kick, to whom he is a little diffident, who is gentle and kind, although he knows nothing about the case. Said black lawyer sports a double barrelled name. LOL.
