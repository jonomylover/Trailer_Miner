2018-01-21T19:17:02,"Your Jesus: It is through the influence of the devil that you become unclean in My Eyes.  -Saturday, March 8th, 2014 @ 13:37  My dearly beloved daughter, the Power of the Holy Spirit is at its strongest at this time in the world, through these Messages.  As the hatred, which Satan has for humanity the world over, has become intense, so also has the Power of the Holy Spirit increased and, with great strength, will strike out at the core of evil.  Always remember that the battle, which exists between God and Satan, is for the souls of man.  And while every power and Grace is poured over mankind by My Father – every wicked deed and act is perpetrated by the evil one over souls.   Many people are impervious to what is happening and sadly many give themselves willingly to Satan by opening up their souls and allowing him to enter them.  It can take some time before Satan really manifests himself within souls and for those who continually seek reconciliation through Me, Jesus Christ, they will be given the Graces to stand up to him, in order to protect themselves from succumbing to acts which can lead to complete depravity.   I urge all of you to pray for the souls who fall victim to Satan’s wicked schemes and intent.  Please recite this Prayer: Crusade Prayer (139) For the strength to defeat evil  Dear Jesus, protect me from the evil of the devil. Cover me and all those who are weak and defenseless in his presence with Your Precious Blood. Give me the courage to deny him and help me to avoid any attempt by him to engage me in any way, every day. Amen.  Please do not ignore My warning, about the dangers of engaging with the devil, by succumbing to his wicked ways.  When you emulate his traits, which include lying, self-indulgence, inflicting of pain on others and slandering your neighbor, then you will know that he has devoured you and it will only be through Me, and the Graces I impart to you, that you will be able to withdraw from the grip he will hold over you.  Always call out to Me, Jesus Christ, when you know in your heart that it is through the influence of the devil that you become unclean in My Eyes.
