The book was cliche and the main character was two dimensional. The trailer is giving me a lot of 10 Things I Hate About You vibes and that's actually one of my favorite movies ever (mostly bc of Heath Ledger if I'm being honest). Yes, 10 Things is also cliche and kind of dumb, but that type of thing is much more entertaining in movies. I think the movie looks funny and verrrry classic 90s teen movie.

But after reading the book, I completely agree with everyone who is disappointed in this adaptation. I know it's just the trailer, but it's pretty darn obvious that... well, this is not The DUFF. This completely strays from the book. She doesn't chase Wesley to get a transformation, she uses him to ease her pain (family drama). She doesn't go to prom or homecoming, she is against it. She doesn't tell her friends or Wesley how much being called DUFF hurt her, she keeps that bottled up until the very end. There is no popular mean girl that antagonizes Bianca in the book. This movie shouldn't be called ""The DUFF"" because it's not The Duff. This is basically fan-fiction. They just used the same characters (really, they just used the same names) and created a different story. It's honestly quite sad because the book was beautiful and it dealt with some real life issues.

2015-01-28T20:20:53,"Complaining about changes to the books is weird to me.  This is a high school movie, it needs a PG-13 rating and that's not gonna happen with the sex.  It's basic entertainment industry economics: you can write a book for a pretty narrow demographic, say people age 15-19.  Movies are a lot more expensive and therefore the target demographic has to be a lot wider.  Ergo the sex gets tossed so you have something people are gonna let tweens go see.  The concept is not original, but before anyone starts in on She's All That, what we're really talking about is Pygmalion going back to 1912.  So nope, it's not a original but neither are the teen movies that came out in the 1990's.  Yes, these do tend to get remade.  But that's because they have a target demographic that is way too young (or not yet born) when the older versions came out.  Reality is to a 16 year old now movies like Clueless and She's All That are going to look hopelessly dated.  It's a different spin on the concept and therefore should be judged on individual merit.  Besides, these movies do contain a pretty important message for teenagers.  Namely that the rigid class structure they live in is not nearly as predestined as many of them would like to believe and isn't going to go on forever.  After all, the original Pygmalion was a satire of the rigid British aristocracy. ",0,0,John Doe,ci7eKlNRiuw,0.0630429292929293,2015-01-28 20:20:53,True,True

After Wesley calls Bianca a Duff she feels uncomfortable by it but doesn't try to change just because he called her one, and she accepts being a Duff and learns that everyone is someone's Duff at some point. In the movie, she feels very offended by it just like in the book but except she tries to get Wesley to help her not look like one. In the Book she begins to have family and ex-boyfriend issues and then uses him as an escape from her real problems by having sex with him, so they became enemies-with benefits. In the movie, they have Bella Thorne who plays a mean girl, which is different from the book because her character actually doesn't exist at all in the book which I find pointless. In the movie, Bianca throws water at Wesley's shirt whereas in the book, it's Cherry Coke. In the movie when she throws her drink on Wesley his shirt is different, as opposed to the white polo shirt he was wearing in the book. In the movie, there's that funny Asian dude that I don't mind, but in the book there is no Asian guy. In the movie, I believe Casey is blonde and Jess is a brunette. In the book Casey and Jessica are both blonde. In the movie the mom seems like a lonely nut job. In the book she travels a lot and is very beautiful, much like a movie star actress, and smart. In the books  Bianca curses Ode, especially at Wesley. In the movie it doesn't seem like she's going to curse that much, or even at all.

So what if one chick is a little bit bigger then the stereotypical perfect image of femininity that this nation is so damned obsessed with? And why the hell is the outgoing spunky blonde the typical face of the enemy in these movies? I say to hell with the guy for calling her ""fugly"" to begin with, and three cheers for teaching girls that other girls aren't the enemy, that you can be blonde or brunette, plus sized or a size one and still be damned beautiful.  If anyone's at fault, it's our society for making us think otherwise. ",1,0,Treacherous Thoughts,ci7eKlNRiuw,0.003409090909090917,2015-02-17 05:57:01,False,True

As soon as I heard that The DUFF (one of my fav books cuz of its realness) was being made into a movie, I got excited but then immediately was sad cuz Hollywood ruins almost all stories. People mentioned Percy Jackson and that's a great example of just changing the entire plot rather than a couple details (like in Harry Potter). I saw the movie first and thought the book would be interesting to read. I read it and was immediately pissed at the movie for changing it so completely. I could rant about it forever but thats not my point. My point is that Hollywood, while trying to make something more likely to be seen, makes it worse and less likely to be enjoyed. They don't respect the people who made the movie possible. By that I mean the author (who is usually part of the movie somewhat but u know they are just pushed off to the side or something) and the fans who made it popular. I guessing that everyone who loved the book--like me-- loved it cuz of how it doesn't cover up the bad sides of the protagonist but rather makes you identify with her more cuz she's just so messed up but not in a book kinda way. Kody Keplinger wasn't trying to shove Bianca's problems down your throat with ""numb"" imagery, but made her feel like a normal girl who, despite dealing with a lot of crap, has to go on with her life. She doesn't make her even make an effort to change but rather she finds escape in another person in a very unhealthy enemies-with-benefits relationship.

2017-08-15T02:17:31,"I could forgive setting changes, changing how the characters look, and other small things like that. But this movie is completely unrecognizable from the book. In the book, Bianca is insecure that she feels less attractive than her friends, and is dealing with a lot of issues, like her fathers alcoholism, her mother leaving, and her ex boyfriend coming to town (they dated when she was 14 and he used her for sex then she found out she was the ""other girl"" the whole time). Bianca is overwhelmed with Everything and starts a sexual relationship with Wesley  to attempt to escape from her problems. She learns that eventually your problems catch up with you & she struggles with pushing Wesley away because she thinks he will reject her. The book has strong themes of learning you can't just avoid your problems; emotional growth; not judging others; and most of all learning to accept yourself for who you are, that it's okay to feel like the ""duff"" because everyone does sometimes.   The movie on the other hand, is about Bianca asking Wesley to help her not be unattractive and change her. It's just like any other ""ugly duckling turns into a swan"" or ""uncool high school girl suddenly becomes popular and everything is perfect"" that's been done countless times. It's the complete opposite of what the book was even about. Instead of showing you don't have to change who you are to be liked, it says you should do just that.
