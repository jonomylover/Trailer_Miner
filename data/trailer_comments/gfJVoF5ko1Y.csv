2016-05-12T04:22:48,"Just for the record I saw this when it had under 15k views, hopefully come this December that'll turn out to have been a good thing. Although the games have become  formulaic and have strayed from the golden feel of installments like Brotherhood(which by the way Ubisoft is trying to bring back in the next game taking place in Egypt), the basic story line of the Assassins vs. the Templars throughout history is fascinating and can have some great stories spring from it, like in Brotherhood as I mentioned before. But those storys I feel can hindered when Ubisoft trys to cram in a modern day storyline, the fact that the characters the viewer sees the most and is supposed to become attached to is blatantly shown to be a person who is basically fake(due to how we're seeing their experience through the eyes of another character) is nothing short of spit in the face of the historical characters plot arc. The movie would due better had it just been about the assassins in the Spanish Inquisition as then you'd grow on those characters more without the constant knowledge that they aren't actually real. If AC wanted to thread in a modern day storyline thats fine,  but let that be its own thing for the same reasons. Anyway I hope that the film adhears at least to the exuberantly potent and poetic clash of Assassin ideology  and Templar ideology.

I'm not going to hold my breath considering how movies based on games usually go plus the fact that the last two assassin's creed games were pretty bad (syndicate was not near as bad as Unity but it still isn't the strongest to date).   If Ubisoft decided to take a year off from this franchise (evidently only the gaming side) then I think that says a lot about how this movie may or may not go.   I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

The level of control being afforded to Ubisoft divided critics of both games and films, with many noting that while Hollywood insiders considered Sony's move to have killed the film before it had even begun, gamers considered the move to be beneficial to the franchise's future, as in recent years, game adaptations had tended to be of poor quality.[20] Senior Vice President of International Marketing, Jean de Rivieres, echoed this sentiment, and claimed that the film will ""reflect the brands accurately and consolidate our fan base.""  -Source: http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Assassin's_Creed_(film)   This means this movie might actually be pretty good quality compared to previous horrendous game-to-film adaptations.",0,0,rcenthusiast bodhi,gfJVoF5ko1Y,0.04895833333333333,2016-05-12 06:21:01,True,True

Like in the first game.  They got good actors in the cast so as far as the acting goes it could be pretty good.  The animus is different and pretty cool looking. If you ask me the animus has a cooler concept in this movie than in the games. As long as the animus works the same as it does in the games then it's fine. And it looks like it does just that which is perfect.  The story has MOSTLY elements of the games but is also original so it's a good contrast of both. Which could lead it to being not only a great video game movie, but just a great MOVIE in general. Just do what's best for the overall movie.

Could be that I've been done with the AC series for awhile, and not because of the game play; the narrative got really frustrating around AC3 with just more and more unresolved conspiracy nonsense thrown in just to make the narrative seem smarter than it is.  That's what I got from this trailer; all style and flash, but not much in the way of substance.  I probably won't check it out, but I certainly don't want it to bomb; I do want Hollywood committed to making good video game adaptations for feature length films, and if this film does well, that could encourage more projects like this.

I love the AC games, played all of them to 100% completion in singleplayer and except for Unity (i'm not even talking about all the bugs, but all the forced multiplayer and coop-crap)  i enjoyed every single minute of it. But let's face it - the lore of AC is really hard to get, it's quite confusing and you can easily get lost in it even if you pay attention - or to put it short, it can be quite messy. Not bad, but ... messy. Convoluted. And then they try to do it justice in a 2 hour movie ? That's almost certainly going to fail. Or they'll water it down so much it has nothing to do with AC anymore.",0,0,walkingdeadman19,gfJVoF5ko1Y,0.001448412698412689,2016-05-12 13:42:01,True,True

2016-05-12T15:58:43,"Jeez, its clear that this has been made now, and not when AC first came out, because this film, like recent games is clearly missing the point of why people liked AC.  Focussing on rebellion, flashy stunts, etc, instead of genuinely deep story. AC1 wasn't very well received, and only now receives as much praise as it does due to the success that was AC2. The character of Ezio, watching him literally from birth grow into a master assassin... That was awesome!  This is going for the feel of AC Syndicate. Trying to be current and ""edgy"" instead of beautiful and slow.  I think what I'm trying to say, is that this film and modern Creed games do not try to earn their place. AC2 tried hard and is still a fan favourite. ACbf was Pirates of the Caribbean so people liked the change of pace. Modern games are more of the same.

This is a first trailer, so for those of you throwing fits over the music, shush; the next one will be more serious.   Pros: Actors are top notch, cinematography looks great (compared to Prince of Persia, I mean come on, guys.) Parkour looks fancy and Abstergo looks scary.   Cons: Music was bad, but like I said just wait for trailer #2 and you worried will be put to rest. I have know idea why Fassbender has a tentacle looking thing for the animus, looks like something out of a Wachowski movie. When the female assassin double killed those two guys, notice how there's no blood on her blades?   I rate the trailer 7/10 and expect the movie to be a 8-9/10, I may be wrong and it might be better or worse. Keep your hopes up, people.

Should have stuck with 'Iron' by Woodkid from the Revelations trailer), except me, I'm not excited about it. I've bought every Assassin's Creed game as soon as they were released, well everything up till Unity, I've given up with the game series now. But when the movie was rumoured in late 2011 I was actually looking forward to it, I thought that they'd finally be able to adapt a game to a movie without half assing it and just plain ruining it, but seeing this just takes away any anticipation that I had.  Starting with the biggest point, the plot. I've seen many a film take a premise from something then try to make their own original story from it, and almost every time they fail. I understand that its hard to follow a very long game script exactly but it was successful, so use it, follow it, make some minor changes but don't try to be original. They should have stuck with Altair. Stick with the rebel Assassin who has to learn how to properly be an assassin, shows development and saves the order. Stick with the apple of Eden. Okay because of the landscaping it would have been hard but I'm sure they could have managed it.   Even the Animus annoys me. It's simply supposed to be a virtual reality system that lets the user relive their ancestors history by constructing 'levels' from his genetic memory by placing a helmet like piece of equipment on his head (much like our current vr systems), then rods go through the top of his spine to latch on to the memory center in the brain. Now I understand that something as simple as this is just to boring for a Hollywood movie, but something like a capsule that he stands in or is forcefully placed into would have done, but instead they've got what seems like a fully sentient robot arm to give him a cuddle around his waist (okay it seems to latch to his spine), but that machine wouldn't look out of place in hentai.   Now I actually like Jeremy Irons playing the CEO of Abstergo Industries, I actually really like that choice. I also like Michael Fassbender as actor, I just think he might be a little too old. I know that 39 isn't that old in present times, but keep in mind this is the late 1400's, 39 was a pensioner back then, he'd barely be able to move let alone do all the stuff assassin's in the series do.   I will go see it when it comes out, just in case I am wrong and they do a fantastic job, but I'm not looking forward to it.",0,0,MrReilz,gfJVoF5ko1Y,0.024902597402597402,2016-05-13 02:44:57,True,True

The storyline is sos immersive and beautiful. This really is an interesting concept to play around with, but I hope they do it well. I'm not a huge fan of the music put behind the trailer, because I don't really understand the whole 'God' reference when the assassins goal is to go unnoticed?? ""We work in the dark to serve the light."" So, that whole 'God' thing seems a little..out there. But other than that, this was good!

2016-05-13T05:42:05,"I'm guessing it's going to be a decent enough action film. Some cool fight scenes and nice special effects. The story however will likely be a bit of a confused mess as they'll try to appeal to both mainstream movie-going audiences and fans of the game. The story will be straightforward Assassins=Good Templars=Bad rather than having any of the nuance of the games (well AC1, AC3, AC4 and ACU) where the Templars aren't cartoonish villains and can be characters you actually find yourself sympathising with. The film will waste too much time trying to explain¬†old concepts from the games¬†to new audiences which will slow down the action (as I mentioned likely the only strong point the film will have). From what I can tell from articles online, this movie seems to be a vanity project for Michael Fassbender and an extended advertisement/fill-in for Ubisoft since there's no main-series AC game coming out this year - they won't be making money off the game like they usually do so they'll be hoping this fills their wallets in the meantime while perhaps garnering some interest for next year's AC game among people who had not previously played the games. So yeah, to reiterate: some entertaining action scenes tied together with an overly simplified¬†plot intended to bring in new audiences. Might make just enough money on the back of its brand to break even at the box office. I'll give it a chance.",1,1,kingkong381,gfJVoF5ko1Y,0.019928724474179017,2016-05-13 05:42:05,True,True

2016-05-13T09:37:01,"Hmm, in regards to ""I am a god"" by kanye used for the trailer. I'm a bit conflicted.  Being a fan of kanyes i will admit i come with a pre-affinity for the song used. However, I recognize that it was a bit jarring the first time i heard it and it took a few listens to grow on me.  That being said i do agree with some that the beat fit this actually quite well. Think of it more like a cadence or like something someone would fight rhythmicly to sort of like a dancer. That aspect of the song is good imo. However, the inclusion of the chorus of ""i am a god"", thats the part that seems a bit off. Not for the song itself just in context of the AC lore I spose. Assassins knew they were powerful but i don't believe it was to the extent of godly. Like if it was just during the trailer once or something okay...but they chose to use it multiple times, even as a ""tagline"" of sorts for the title shot. That emphasizes the line and reverant like stance which i feel, again, was a bit out of place.  Overall VERY unexpected song choice but love the instrumental feel with the trailer. Looks...promising actually.*fingers crossed*",0,0,Kageneko,gfJVoF5ko1Y,0.23454545454545456,2016-05-13 09:37:01,True,True

2016-05-13T16:04:02,I'm 50/50 with this trailer.  The fact that it's thrown into the middle of the franchise without explaining how the Assassins first came to be already docked points off for me.  Cause it kinda feels like Ubisoft is just throwing out another DLC but in the form of a Movie.  If they don't touch base on how the Assassins were created or even a hint about the Apple or The Truth then I genuinely think this movie is going to bust.   It just looks like it's focused more on Flashy Action instead of Story Telling.  Just my 2 cents on the subject.,0,0,Arutea_,gfJVoF5ko1Y,-0.027083333333333334,2016-05-13 16:04:02,True,True

2016-05-13T17:24:31,"Am I the only one who actually likes the music in this trailer? It adds suspense and a little bit of edgy darkness which compliments the mood of the franchise.  I'm 100% sure if Kanye West's vocals weren't in the song, you wouldn't even be aware that it was his song. And if you weren't aware of it being his song, you wouldn't be getting over-sensitive about it. That'd be like you liking a piece of art then immediately dismissing it just because you dislike the creator. Wow so shallow. Please rewatch the trailer and mute only Kanye's part out - you wouldn't be thinking ""oh this sounds a lot like a Kanye West song"" would you? But because you hear him and dislike him as a person (understandable - he is an egotistical douche lol) you suddenly think the whole backing track doesn't synchronize (see what I did there?) with the visual. I say this because a lot of you mention his name... And hey even the whole ""God"" verses thing to me relates to the secret history-defining war of the Assassins and the Templars (sounds badass).  TL;DR: It's my opinion that the dark music works in this trailer down to the franchise's mood / you can hate the artist but not the entire damn track / get over yourself and give it another watch without such superficial judgement.  P.S.: Regarding the re-edited versions on YouTube, the GamesRadar and BinarySunProductions edits are the only alternatives I like so far (but still prefer the original). The others have either more elegant or upbeat music which comes across as slightly innocent or plain cool without mystique (neither don't suit). Epic/orchestral music seems to work best (e.g.: Woodkid and Thomas J. Bergersen).",0,0,RaynStorm Gaming,gfJVoF5ko1Y,0.10281084656084656,2016-05-13 17:24:31,True,True

This movie will possible have some small references to the games storyline here and there i hope.  Perhaps they will mention Ezio or something in the movie since the spanish inquisition started at 1478 and Ezios storyline in the games takes place at around that time.

This is a copy / paste of my response to a previous comment.  I agree with you on the uplay and dlc jokes being in poor taste. I also  agree that the trailer looks good. However, I am glad they went with an  entirely new storyline. The risks of things going badly with a  pre-exisiting character is way to high.  - What if the actor looks nothing like the character? I've already seen a  comment from an irate fan who thought the character was Ezio freaking  out that they could have gotten someone so much better. - What if the character didn't behave as the fans think he/she should? I  know I would be pissed if it was suppose to be Altair but acted more  like Edward. - All the assassins full histories/storylines have been written so if  they tried to create some sidequestesque (I know that's not a real word  but hopefully you get what I mean) plot and then tried stuffing it  somewhere in the middle of an already established story would be  ridiculous. I'm glad they went with a new assassin and I am super excited to see the  movie.

I'm glad they chose the latter, because one franchise *cough* cod *cough* turning into Halo is bad enough. Assassins Creed definitely omitted some of the most interesting time periods when they skipped from Europe in the 1500's to America in 1777. I always thought it was a horrible choice and a poor setting for an Assassins Creed style of game, which relied on free-running on old and stunning architecture as one of it's primary selling points. Anyways, what's done is done, and it looks like we will be able to visit Spain and France in the Medieval and Renaissance periods, which is what I had always wanted. Maybe further down the line they can finally do a Russian Revolution game, but that's about as far as I think it can go without losing what AC is all about.

2016-05-14T11:47:24,"Comment that I agree with from NeoGaf:  'The problem with Kanye's music here is that it changes the entire tone of the series. Him babbling about him being a god doesn't fit well. Sure, they're maybe going for the whole ""Abstergo playing god"" or Fassbender being god, but it gives the wrong impression about the movie. The song should be about history and mystery and dread and adventure and curiosity and science fiction. Kanye's music comes out as arrogant and disdain to the series that has always had great trailers and great music. It gives the idea that Fassbender is going to pop in his Beats by Dre under the hoodie and proclaim that the A in Assassin's Creed stands for America. That and we've had too much of Kanye. That and the sampling/chanting in the song doesn't go well with the trailer at all.  I like the beat. I see what they're going for. But everything else doesn't fit.

2016-05-24T08:37:40,Its true that video game to movies rarely turn out well. However its best not to go in there expecting it to be Assassins Creed Game turned Movie...  Focus on it as a movie and not as a game while watching it and you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.  I think it looks good.  Its a little hard to screw up the Assassins Creed story. Its pretty straight forward and we all know it already so its not like the story will surprise you.  If you go in expecting to be wowed by the story. Keep in mind you already know the story. So you'll probably have the same experience people have that read the book of a movie before watching the movie and they enjoy the movie less too.    Don't go in all hyped up expecting anything ground breaking for Assassins Creed and simply go with the mindset of trying to enjoy it as an Independent and live action telling of a great series of games.  The biggest problem with having games turned movies is that we all play the games differently. We all interpret the story lines differently and we all follow our own path when playing. A movie is purely linear and the characters are not the characters you play.   What I mean is when I play a game I become the character. When watching a movie that doesn't happen.  Still It looks like it'll be a very action packed movie that may turn out fairly well.,0,0,Seohn Aranys,gfJVoF5ko1Y,0.15407720057720056,2016-05-24 08:37:40,True,True

The Name ""Assassins"":  Nobody knows with certainty where the name ""Assassins"" came from. The most commonly-repeated theory holds that the word comes from the Arabic hashishi, meaning ""hashish users."" Chroniclers including Marco Polo claimed that the followers of Sabbah committed their political murders while under the influence of drugs, hence the derogatory nickname. However, this etymology may well have arisen after the name itself, as a creative attempt to explain its origins. In any case, Hasan-i Sabbah strictly interpreted the Koran's injunction against intoxicants.  A more convincing explanation cites the Egyptian Arabic word hashasheen, meaning ""noisy people"" or ""troublemakers.""",0,0,Ay≈üecik TV,gfJVoF5ko1Y,0.4,2016-09-10 10:06:34,True,True

As Shi'ites, many Persians had long felt mistreated by the Arabic Sunni Muslims who controlled the Caliphate for centuries. When the power of the caliphs faltered in the 10th-11th centuries, and Christian Crusaders began to harry them in the eastern Mediterranean, the Shi'a thought their moment had come.  However, a new menace arose to the east, in the form of the newly-converted Turks. Fervent in their beliefs, and militarily powerful, the Sunni Seljuks took control of a vast region including Persia. Outnumbered, the Nizari Shi'a could not defeat them in open battle. From a series of mountaintop fortresses in Persia and Syria, however, they could assassinate Seljuk leaders - and strike fear into their allies.",0,0,Ay≈üecik TV,gfJVoF5ko1Y,0.12662337662337664,2016-09-10 10:07:16,True,True

2017-03-16T19:40:34,Cinemasins is going to have a field day with this movie. While mindfucking a bunch of assassins ( or people with the physical ability to be assassins) they give them all full access to melee weapons and bows but the icing on the cake is that no one in this modern day facility had guns.. Was this done in Canada or something? Either way this laboratory hardly seems like a stand-up legal operation and so you would think that having guns would be a thing. Not a bad movie but parts of it make no sense at all and I still don't understand why the kid's father killed his mother.,0,0,sizlax,gfJVoF5ko1Y,0.08690476190476192,2017-03-16 19:40:34,False,True
