2015-11-17T22:55:02,People talking about race...so dumb but here are some facts.  First off the skin color of the Ancient Egyptians was BROWN. I mean the real color brown like my photo...not black skinned. How do I know? Because they were mixed like I am. Mixed with Darker skinned Africans and the Middle east people. They also painted pictures of themselves just google it and you will see they were brown and none were white skinned. They were smart enough to make the pyramids I would say they were smart enough to paint themselves the right color with the right likeness. History fact coming up: Egyptians did not become as light as they are today until Egypt was conquered by Greece. Then the race mixing happened on a national level for many many years. In this case the famous Cleopatra may have looked white in that her father was a Greek General and her mother an Egyptian queen. But yes...The Ancient Egyptians were the color BROWN up until Greece took over and even now their color is not pure white. Just some facts. If anyone says I am wrong please post where your facts come from. And it must be a credited university source and so on.

The white washing of Jesus Christ, who is considered by most caucasians to be caucasian (even though his middle eastern origin is no secret) is one of the most obvious reasons for the existence of racism.  The logic is fairly easy to follow: 1.First, Jesus is ""white"" 2. Also, Jesus is God 3.Therefore, God is ""white"". 3.Humans were created in God's image 4.Ergo, caucasians were created in God's image. 5.Anyone not caucasian is a bastardization of God's image, and should be regarded with contempt.

2015-11-18T13:38:02,"On face value there is really nothing wrong with this as it is a fictional movie, and whom ever finances and produces the movie can cast whomever they  like. But the issue with Ancient Egypt is that the history and knowledge of it was built upon racist Egyptology. Many of these early Egyptologist practice pseudo-science  and scientific racism which built a false narrative of the identity of the Ancient Egyptians. Now there seems to be a resistant among mainstream academics to acknowledge the overwhelming direction of the evidence accumulated in recent times. In academia if you want tenure and the ability to obtain grants for research and work permits from the Egyptian government then you better fall in line and play along. For those reasons, because this fictional film continues to perpetuate a false narrative about Ancient Egypt is why this is so concerning.   ""There is now a sufficient body of evidence from modern studies of  skeletal remains to indicate that the ancient Egyptians, especially  southern Egyptians, exhibited physical characteristics that are within  the range of variation for ancient and modern indigenous peoples of the  Sahara and tropical Africa.. In general, the inhabitants of Upper Egypt  and Nubia had the greatest biological affinity to people of the Sahara  and more southerly areas."" (Nancy C. Lovell, "" Egyptians, physical  anthropology of,"" in Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt,  ed. Kathryn A. Bard and Steven Blake Shubert, ( London and New York:  Routledge, 1999) pp 328-332)    Other ancient Egyptian practices show strong similarities to modern African cultures including divine kingship, the use of headrests, body art, circumcision, and male coming-of-age rituals, all suggesting an African substratum or foundation for Egyptian civilization..""  -- Source: Donald Redford (2001) The Oxford encyclopedia of ancient Egypt, Volume 3. Oxford University Press. p.28    Archaeological evidence also strongly supports an African origin. A widespread northeastern African cultural assemblage, including distinctive multiple barbed harpoons and pottery decorated with dotted wavy line patterns, appears during the early Neolithic (also known as the Aqualithic, a reference to the mild climate of the Sahara at this time). Saharan and Sudanese rock art from this time resembles early Egyptian iconography. Strong connections between Nubian (Sudanese) and Egyptian material culture continue in later Neolithic Badarian culture of Upper Egypt. Similarities include black-topped wares, vessels with characteristic ripple-burnished surfaces, a special tulip-shaped vessel with incised and white-filled decoration, palettes, and harpoons...  Source: Donald Redford (2001) The Oxford encyclopedia of ancient Egypt, Volume 3. Oxford University Press. p.28  ""Ancient Egypt belongs to a language group known as 'Afroasiatic'  (formerly called Hamito-Semitic) and its closest relatives are other  north-east African languages from Somalia to Chad. Egypt's cultural  features, both material and ideological and particularly in the earliest  phases, show clear connections with that same broad area. In sum,  ancient Egypt was an African culture, developed by African peoples, who  had wide ranging contacts in north Africa and western Asia."" (Morkot, Robert (2005) The Egyptians: An Introduction. Routledge. p. 10)    ""Certainly there was some foreign admixture [in Egypt], but basically a  homogeneous African population had lived in the Nile Valley from ancient  to modern times... [the] Badarian people, who developed the earliest  Predynastic Egyptian culture, already exhibited the mix of North African  and Sub-Saharan physical traits that have typified Egyptians ever since  (Hassan 1985; Yurco 1989; Trigger 1978; Keita 1990.. et al.,)... The  peoples of Egypt, the Sudan, and much of East African Ethiopia and  Somalia are now generally regarded as a Nilotic continuity, with widely  ranging physical features (complexions light to dark, various hair and  craniofacial types) but with powerful common cultural traits, including  cattle pastoralist traditions..""

If we are basing this movie off of Ancient Egypt and their gods, it's common sense that the people should be dark skinned or black because the most ancient rulers and people were undeniably black. Instead, Hollywood and textbooks show everyone as white just because the Greeks and Caucasians took over towards the end of the Egyptian dynasties. It's not enough to conquer, they rather change history because the people don't have the same pigment as them. Altering history is truly one of the spoils of war granted to the victor.

2015-11-19T09:52:19,"How to, in my opinion, turn this into something good:  1. Either spend money and hours on good make-up, or use actors and people who at least look like Egyptians.  2. Why all the CGI robot-ish style? We all saw the Transformers movies and some metal god is not new or exciting and looks like a cheap shot. I'd suggest you go for a more Alien look, or at least solely organic. Can be very futuristc and sci-fi esque, but not the cyborg/metal/robot type gods. Also, stay more true to the original Egyptian visions of the gods in terms of color, size, etc.  While you are at it, you can implement the idea of ""Alien touch on humans"" that could both lead to the idea of religions, early advances in science, etc. Or maybe use different dimensions rather than different worlds.  3. Don't have 'Hollywood' written all over the movie. With this I mean don't make it so foreseeable. If we as viewers can anticipate the entire movie, then what is the idea of making it a Big Screen film? If it is just for a sunday amusement thing then release it on Netflix and be done with it. I am not paying for going to the cinema just to watch a movie I already know the ending of halfway through.  4. Don't rely on action alone. Ancient Egypt was home to some astonishing landscapes and sceneries. Make use of all the visual potential, as well as sound. When that is done, make sure to include a great dose of psychological aspects too. Getting inside the head of the main Antagonists as well as side characters is always a big part of a good movie (imo). Let us experience the movie through the characters, rather than through a big screen while sitting comfortably. Have us on the edge, let us feel like a part of the movie and the story.  5. Last but not least, don't spoil it. Make an epic and interesting trailer, which gives us enough reason to be interested in the movie, as well as wanting to know more. Wanting to 'know more' is what makes people go see it in the cinema. Leave us wanting to know more, experience more. That is what a good trailer is supposed to do.  Looking at this trailer, the movie seems almost done, so I doubt any big changes will happen. I do hope, that someone else will make another attempt at the Egyptian Gods in the future, and that they don't mess it up. It could easily be a big hit on pair with The Hunger Games, James Bond, Batman, etc.",0,0,MISTER SIR,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.20283301767676765,2015-11-19 09:52:19,True,True

In Star Wars i know what it is because its an Original Score. In Blade Runner I know what movie it is get it!. even more recent in Prometheus guess what i know what movie it is. if your going to make a large movie take a fxcken risk man and get a proper score.  2) Stay correct with History where are the black people? egyptians were black not white.

The majority of us have an olive skin tone somewhere in the middle between that of southern Europeans and that of Arabs. A lot of us have Arabic ancestry, but it didn't really change much in terms of our skin color. We can't really tell the difference between those of Arabic background and those who are not based on their looks. And we are pretty sure ancient Egyptians looked very similar to us based on ""Fayum mummy portraits"" and other things. There is also a minority in the southern part of Egypt called ""Nubia"" where people have a darker skin tone. ""Nubia"" was a key player in the history of ancient Egypt, and maybe that's why a lot of people tend to think ancient Egyptians were black.

All these ancients gods are just fallen angels (damned for eternity). I laughed so hard knowing how these people try to manipulate us. These gods are not stories and myths and they still exists that's why these people (illuminati) try to worship them as they can give all worldly desires but not salvation and eternal life.

Not to complain much because it actually looks like it might be an awesome movie but come on Hollywood you canât completely âwhite-washâ something like this & expect people not get offended etc. I mean honestly this is like me making a movie about Celtic Gods & all the actors ( Gods & such ) are all being played by dark skinned African people. I get that Egypt might be fascinating but you canât just insert white people ( Caucasoid ) into a country of people who are NOT white then claim it as your own.......wait.....LOL,1,0,Mind Master,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.12109375000000001,2015-11-20 02:48:57,True,True

And to those complaining the cast should be black because Egyptians are ""black"". well I can tell you people of the northern Africa are neither black nor white.. they are further away from the equator than countries like Nigeria or Kenya so they have a brownish tan that is more common in Middle East and Pakistan/India etc. Now the pharaohs were definitely not black according the DNA analysis carried out recently.. can't explain in detail here but Google Jo Merchant's essay call ""Tutankhamun's Blood"" if interested.. so might I suggest a better cast if you really want to be racist about who to cast in a MOVIE? Actors like Oded Fehr, Alexander Siddig, Ali Suliman, Said Taghmaoui or Naveen Andrews would have been a better choice and for the young mortal hero someone like Dev Patel.. but I don't mind the white cast other than Ewan McGregor coz he's out of place in a movie like this..",0,0,Hasaan Anjum,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.20454545454545456,2015-11-20 03:32:14,True,True

Scholars have said the Great Sphinx of Giza face looked black or negroid! All this  scientific racism and racial hierarchy needs yo stop.

How could any producer place their trust to cast an unknown Egyptian actor for that kind of investment? 2) movies are for Entertainment yet every Egyptian movie is made into a race issue no matter what you do and the focus is about race rather than about the entertainment value of the movie - even when u cast Chadwick boseman, a black lead, they are still not satisfied. So no matter what u do, they will complain. 3) why spend so much money making movies about their culture when they don't appreciate your effort to do it for them? 4) why bother to go through so much troubles when no matter what you do these movies about Egypt are going to flop so u wasted your money, talents, and efforts?So please save yourself from troubles and stop making movies about Egypt.

I've read about two of his novels. * I could care less about the race of the actors or the CGI.* Movies don't  always revolve around race. But I do understand the complaint in regards to the setting and the characters. In the film industry, it's about the director making intelligent choices, actors' ability to act and the power of storytelling that comes together. The Egyptians were not all painted as ""brown or dark"" people. The actual Pharaohs sometimes were of lighter skin and believed to be superior above the population. So you mentioning racism now has already become outdated. Plus, these gods mentioned are the Ennead. They can look however they want. They don't care what mortals think about how they look. They express their appearance in anyway they see fit. Heck, Osiris has green skin and Atum is sometimes presented having blue skin.   My only issue with this film is how the plot seems to be executed from the trailer. It doesn't seem very strong. Osiris isn't even mentioned, at all. That's so....UGH. Go look up the Legend of Osiris. Horus never went after Set because ""he stole his eye"" and then Set stole the throne immediately in a simple asskicking contest. That never happened in the story.  Also ""The Eye"", is not a physical object. Wadjet was relevant to that at one point during the mythos. She's one of the older godesses that gets skipped pretty often in regards to this pantheon. The Eye is more of an abstract entity that can act upon the will of its master at the time or personified instead as a servant of the Patron Pharaoh. :/  Not gonna lie though, their ""Sheuts"" look kinda interesting with the metallic exoskeleton. Still the fact they refer to Set in the description as a god of darkness. *CRINGE* He's not. And Horus tricked Set into giving up the throne by illegitimate means since he couldn't compete against him on equal terms. So in this story. Cheater's Win and gain the favor Maat. *sigh* I wish this wasn't called Gods of Egypt. It comes as off pretentious of what the Ennead were and ""only another movie based on abridged mythos.""  I want to dislike this film but at the same time, I want to like it because  I'm very fond of the Ogdoad, the Ennead and the other major gods such as Re and Apep. The stories told and philosophy of the ancients of  are quite interesting. And we haven't really had a film with a visually appealing or vibrant landscape in regards to the area surrounding the Nile.   It's so inaccurate from a story perspective, but I hope at least it'll be entertaining It'll probably be another guilty pleasure to see it only for that.

2015-11-21T08:43:31,"Okey. Let's clarify the whole mess.  There're actually more than 25% of the Egyptian people nowadays who are Christians, who are not ARABS.  The Christian Egyptians are, nowadays, called the Coptic Christian. Their origin was of ""Mesreyam"" son of ""Ham"" son of ""Noah"", descending from the Ancient Egyptians, the only specific race that survived from their civilisation. Ancient Egyptians are neither black nor white, their genetics are made in order to support the heat weather in Egypt.  If you just imagine our egyptian civilisation, it was much more decent than the directors present. First, lemme tell you some notices.  -We're not looking like the Greek Civilisation and Athena colosseums. Their civilisation had their *OWN* style, our real one is not looking like this, never in ever. We're better than the Greece one, the ancient pharaohs used to be considered the KINGS of the world. Our advanced technological level was much more different, those people had done many things that our under called *ADVANCED* scientif theories cannot even explain it. The architecture, the medecine and in each and every part of this.  Atleast directors, if you want to make a good film about us, then come and visit Egypt. The vision from the others are not right about the real way that those people lived out there. How'ever.  -Stop doing unrealistic mythes, I just don't like or enjoy when I see scenes of unrealistic monsters and shits. I read a small book about the Ancient Egyptians cohabitual way of life. The whole sky was just very *CLEAN*, VERY BLUE, you can even watch the stars VERY clearly from the Earth. They just used to determine their construction  depending on the GODS who live in those stars. In the birthday of Ramses II, the sun just get up on his face, millions of tourists every year, come to visit this moment. Can you just even, try to do something, like this with all of your technology nowadays? How'ever.  Enough talking.  There are christians in Egypt, they are the only ones who still have the intelligent genetics of the Ancient Egyptians. I'm one of them. I'm very proud to be descending from those smart and intelligent people.",0,1,Blacklite Willy,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.20098647186147187,2015-11-21 08:43:31,True,True

2015-11-22T00:34:57,"It's most unfortunate that today some whites have a major problem with ancient Egyptians being displayed as black.  Anthropologists have already proven their origins were of Sub-saharan origin, not Semitic and not Greek.  All of those of African descent came from East Africa anyway.  The body of Cleopatra's sister has recently been found in Turkey and it was concluded that her mother was of African ancestry sub-saharan, not semitic or Greek, therefore Cleopatra's mother was black.  Now the father of Cleopatra was from Macedonia and ruled an empire and Egypt like the other Greek islands fell under his reign.  So in other words her mother was indigenous to Egypt while the father was not.  Hence the ancient Egyptians were of African sub-saharan origin although over time they did begin like other nations to enter marry with other nationalities.  Some of the Greek philosophers have already described this in their writings.  Why do some, not all!! Whites have a real problem with a black African people being anything other than subserviant.  In the tomb of Ramses III an image of the four nationalities were found with color and titles given for each race of people.  The Nubians and the ancient Egyptians were both painted as black while the semitic, Asians, and Europeans as either white or very light peach in color.  The only difference between the depiction of the Egyptians and the Nubians was their clothing.  In my opinion we should remember that every nation of people have had a time of triumph hence there is no need to continue degrading and dismissing the history of others out of spite and arrogance.",32,9,Maurice McCoy,IJBnK2wNQSo,-0.02036666666666666,2015-11-22 00:34:57,True,True

2015-11-22T02:45:52,"One must remember humans don't fit neatly into 17th Century connotations of race. Humans are clinal, which means gradual change in an inherited characteristic across the geographic range of a species. Africans can be light skin, dark skin or medium and so can people from the Middle east or Asia. For instance their are dark skin people in Pakistan, India and Melanesia. With that said the modern Egyptians may have some ancestral blood line to the ancients but they are highly admixed with centuries of foreign immigration into Egypt. The darker Egyptians in the South, Sudanese and Ethiopians are probably a closer representative to the Ancient Egyptians. Historically, there has been an attempt by scholars and Egyptologist to remove Egypt from Africa, only in recent scholarship has there been a willingness to develop more research in their cultural affinities. But Ancient Egypt was culturally and spiritually African, they practiced the same burials, rituals, Kingship, animal deity worship as their surrounding neighbors. People can debate about race as race is an arbitrary 17th Century classification system but Culturally the Ancient Egyptians were African .",2,1,Tetrahedron IX,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.06841666666666668,2015-11-22 02:45:52,True,True

If you study and read the ancient papyrus and hieroglyphs,  the egyptians themselves talk about how they fought against the dark skinned people for control of lower egypt for years along with fighting with them, they were also fighting with other tribes who wanted power in the region as well. there was one time that one pharaoh even asked for help by the nubians, because crime was so rampant by war lords in the region. after that fight they left with jewels,golds horses! the nubian king piye love egypt so much he even was buried in a mud style pyramid  but this was all way after the pyramids and a lot of the great temples were already built! egyptians and nubians always had a difficult relationship, they are even depicted on hieroglyphs with severed heads! or the brown skinned egyptian people and pharaohs stomping on them ! the pharaohs  even drew up a truce several times with the nubians, the kind of nubia sold his own people as guards and slaves/workers to the egyptians. the king of nubia also exchanged herbs/exotic animals of africa,ivory, gold as well. You can tour how different their culture was even today! there pyramids hardly stood the test of time! all these monuments were made of mud brick! not granite and stone! when they drew the nubians on hieroglyphs, when they captured them as slaves or as portraits they were always black, if all egyptians are black then why do they depict themselves as a light brown. why wouldn't they all be black in colour ? not only that they despised foreigners as well! its apparent once you take time to read the papyrus and hieroglyphs.  some of it is rather disgusting really, comparing them to dirt, how they collected their severed hands! also it's not like this movie excluded african americans they to are in the movie along whites united just as life ought to be ! race hate/racism isnt just against one particular race it's against all races and any race can be racist!  its disgusting and we all should be squashing this crap and uniting !",0,0,Brandon Christopher,IJBnK2wNQSo,-0.06847511574074074,2015-11-23 15:51:35,True,True

2015-11-24T00:49:58,"This reminds me of the discussion around Exodus: Gods and Kings. Ridley Scott on the subject of whitewashing stated the choice of cast was not racially motivated, but rather a consequence of a Hollywood reality, they need the big names to draw to crowds. Egyptian or North African actors are simply not well known enough (in Hollywood).  Why are the most well known actors (in Hollywood) white? The answer seems to be, In a majority white country there will be more white actors, it follows they will be a majority of the actors that are able to draw crowds. However, there seems to be something off when the black minority that makes up 14% of the population, not a small number, do not get to have the lead role in a big production, unless they are:  1. Denzel Washington  2. Will Smith  No one else! The fact that these two actors are actually able to break free of this suggests Hollywood, in the end, cares more about earnings than whitewashing. It's just that whitewashing has proven a very successful business model, as it aims for the biggest market. It's playing it safe.  The response is often ""the people that make these movies have a duty to change that paradigm!""  The reality of big budget moviemaking is that currently very few investors will make a multi million dollar investment to promote social justice ideals. They just want the best, or maybe the safest return on their investment. For this very reason the indie movie scene is full of diversity. Lower budgets equal more artistic freedom. As soon as you start spending someone else's millions the dynamics change.  So the answer is really, really simple if you don't like this. Don't go see it. Instead, go support a filmmaker that DOES support your ideals. Because realistically, the only way a big budget movie will exist that prioritizes (selective) historical accuracy over star power is when it will make them more money.",0,0,Jan Joost Verhoef,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.2043627450980392,2015-11-24 00:49:58,True,True

People commenting on ""good"" CGI examples like Avatar and Inception.  Avatar was just as bad as this IMO.  CLEARLY CGI and the aliens looked like a video game IMO.  The entire planet was CGI and obviously so.  Did the blatant use of CGI make the movie bad though?  No.  Avatar was alright (not AMAZING, like most people say.... I guess I'm not amazed by the overused plot line nor am I a tree hugger).  As for Inception.  That's a Nolan film and he notoriously tries to use as little CGI as possible in all his movies.  Most of the ""cgi"" you think you saw in Inception was likely not CGI.  In fact I really can't think of a scene in that movie that used CGI other than the bending streets/horizons and that city like deal on/near the beach in his dream.  Nowhere near the amount of CGI in Inception as there is in this movie and Avatar.... films made solely dedicated to CGI.... it's pretty much becoming a genre itself..... CGI genre.

2015-11-28T20:06:46,"An Open Letter To Lionsgate Entertainment,  Dear Sirs, I understand the difficulty in making a film on this scale with unknown actors, but I and others must object strongly to the cast you have assembled to partake in this film. I have studied Egyptian mythology all my life, and the ancient Egyptians clearly did NOT portray their gods as human beings, and yet the cast is entirely human. The gods of Egypt were clearly depicted with green, blue, or gold skin, and most had animal heads. Well, it's high time such an under-represented group was given the treatment it deserves in Hollywood. My own father is a purple elephant man, and every time one of these dang films is made, I have to explain to him that his own group is going to be callously represented by the average white or black man yet again.

2015-11-30T17:18:43,"''Were the Ancient Egyptians Africans? What colour was their skin? Yes. Egypt is in Africa and there are many cultural links to other African civilisations. If we look at the skin colour and also facial features on representations of Egyptians, many are what we would consider today to be Black African. Skin colours on temple and wall reliefs show ranges between dark brown and black, which is typical of what we see today with regard to people of Black African descent or origin. Furthermore, Nubians, a group who are accepted universally as Black Africans are, like their neighbours from Kemet, shown on reliefs with both jet black and red-brown skin and can be distinguished as Nubians by their short wigs. Many statues have lost their original skin colour. Sometimes colours were used by the Egyptians symbolically, so for example a statue of a god or royal person would painted gold to represent immortality. If we leave colour aside for a moment, we can also find out a great deal from looking at the facial features shown on Egyptian statues. Here, there can be no doubt that we are dealing with people who were African. Faces were broad with high cheekbones and the jaws are typically strong. The noses are also broad and the lips are generally full and fleshy in appearance.'' http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/dept/ant/egypt/kemet/virtualkemet/faq/  In conclusion - sorry folks but Egyptians were a mix of African (black) Greeks, Persians etc..Use your brains, understand how people were moving from one area to another...Humans did not evolve in isolation, if they did we would have sub-species. There are no sub-species of humans...even racists are not considered a sub species (more the pity).

It just kinna defeats any realism from the perspective of the audience, Ive only really seen it done successfully in that proportion with the 300 movies, and that only worked out because of they used a very specific artsy type CGI themed world that worked out rather perfectly in their favour.

2015-12-03T07:27:44,"Sigh... let me break down why I (and I believe many others) are disappointed by this film.  Its not just this film by itself that is so problematic its that this film is the latest in a long line of Hollywood films where Egyptians are portrayed as white people.  This Hollywood proclivity is only a reflection of the old belief among white academics and white cultures that Egyptians were this random group of white people in Africa.  You see many people of European descent have been fascinated with Egypt for a long time.  However, admitting that Africans had an advanced ancient civilization that had a big impact on the ancient European founders of ""western"" civilization is difficult when you also believe that Africans are sub-humans only fit for manual labor.  So why not pretend the ancient Egyptians were white and try to convince everyone of that as well?!  On top of that there are so few Hollywood roles that fit people of color well ESPECIALLY when it comes to period films, and this one comes around, which would be PERFECT but its..all..white.  As a person of African descent I would love to see a representation of my ancient ancestors on film just like anyone else, but since there is no hint of ancient West African history or folklore, I feel like Egypt is a good compromise.  Yes I know the average ancient Egyptian probably looked just as different from the average African American as from the average European descent person, but damn it they could have at least got some brown actors.  If not North African or middle eastern They could been different and cast some Latino or Desi actors.  Anyway, as much shit as I talked about this movie the special effects look too good to pass up and the story seems pretty fun so I'll probably catch it on Netflix or Redbox or something, but I am Definitely not spending money to watch more white washing of ancient Egypt. #Disappointed... #Again",0,0,Desmond Granger,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.07118437118437118,2015-12-03 07:27:44,True,True

Many people may argue and say well its just a fantasy movie about gods and goddesses with super powers, but you have to look at the bigger picture of where people are coming from so you can understand why we get upset about shit like this. First of all for many years movies and historial documentaries have been casting whites to play ancient egyptians and brainwashing many people into thinking that the ancient egyptians were something other than black people. Some may argue and say that the ancient egyptians were mixed with other races and ethnic groups which is true but that was much later in ancient Egypt's history during the last dynasties during the Roman Empire and when the arab muslims invaded Egypt around 600 A.D.. That is why many modern egyptians resemble mediterranean and arabian people but you can't compare the later generations of egyptians to the older generations that were pure black egyptians prior to the times before they where invaded because that would be like comparing the modern population of americans of mostly blacks and whites to the original population of native americans who where in the Americas before the europeans and africans came to their land.  Another thing people need to realize, just because you see ancient egyptian images of people with narrow noses, thin lips, and straight hair does not mean that the ancient egyptians were not black people. Black africans came in many shades of brown and phenotypes way before the foreigners invaded Africa because black people are the first people on the planet and are the ones who evolved and produced all the other races on the planet. Anthropologist that studied ancient egyptian bones have concluded that most ancient egyptians remsemble black east africans like the somali, oromo, masai, nubian, afar, rendille, and beja ethnic groups. Even today many modern egyptians are less mixed and more pure black like thier ancestors and mainly reside in southern Egypt like the city of Luxor and they are many shades of brown. Our people are tired of our history being watered down to just slavery and so called primitive savages in Africa and we just want people to know our true history and get credit for what we done in human history. If they came out with a movie or documentary about Albert Einstein and had Morgan Freeman play him I would be just as upset because a white man would not be given the credit for what he has done in history. If some of you people reading my comment still don't believe what I'm saying just look up everything I been saying in this comment and find out the truth for yourself because I'm not writing another comment on this page.

Scholars have long debated whether she was Greek or Macedonian like her ancestor the original Ptolemy, a Macedonian general who was made ruler of Egypt by Alexander the Great, or whether she was north African. Evidence obtained by studying the dimensions of ArsinÃ¶eâs skull shows she had some of the characteristics of white Europeans, ancient Egyptians and black Africans, indicating that Cleopatra was probably of mixed race, too. They were daughters of Ptolemy XII by different wives. The results vindicate the theories of Hilke ThÃ¼r of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, who has long claimed that the skeleton was ArsinÃ¶e. She described the discovery of ArsinÃ¶eâs ethnicity as âa real sensation which leads to a new insight on Cleopatraâs familyâ. Fellow experts are now convinced. GÃ¼nther HÃ¶lbl, an authority on the Ptolemies, said the identification of the skeleton was âa great discoveryâ. The forensic evidence was obtained by a team working under the auspices of the Austrian Archeological Institute, which is set to detail its findings at an anthropological convention in the United States later this month.",1,5,Jay D,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.15279356060606059,2015-12-09 03:42:27,True,True

The kingdom of kush is where the aforementioned nubian ethnic group is from, it was partially conquered by egypt several times, hence why nubians are a part of egypt, and why a lot of egyptian art features battles between white-brown people(egyptians) and brown-black people(nubians). There was from what I can understand, a single nubian dynasty, the Twenty-fifth Dynasty(Memphis, under foreign control of Napata, Nubia).  In short. black actors are just as inacccurate as west europeans and their descendants, sub-saharan africa had very little to do with (early)egypt, and as there is a dearth of egyptian actors, there is no appropriate cast of actors within hollywood.  For people complaining about ""cultural appropriation"" you certainly do it a lot.

So say that Egyptians were black is even more stupid than saying that they were Germans. The Egyptians were such as the tribal inhabitants of modern Arabian Peninsula, brown skinned Caucasians. The very Sheik Nasser Al-Khelaifi is an example. In Brazil we have the nostalgia Salem Nasser, known to those who follow international politics. But it is Lebanese, is another aspect, the uprisings did not originally Semitic, which differ in characteristic of the Arabs as well as the ancient Egyptians, had straight hair and darker skin. It is there, in the tomb of Sebekhotep, the figure of a shepherd Syrian skin with a lighter brown tone that the Egyptian, with curly hair, giving offerings to the Pharaoh. The Assyrians drawings were not completely painted, but the ultramente curly hair is present in all the drawings of this civilization. White-skinned Caucasians have begun only to be found during the Mesolithic period, Central Europe, around 5000 BC. The mutation would have arisen before 5000, even in the Neolithic period through European farmers HaploÃ­te I, but only began to spread on the continent in the Mesolithic. So the rest of the world as shown in its artifacts, had brown skin, including Persians, Assyrians, Sumerians, Greeks, Etruscans, Hebrews, Phoenicians, etc. These civilizations are descendants of those who in the neolithic period, immigrated to Europe and brought with them agriculture, which after several generations of low production of vitamin D by eating grain and low sun exposure, acquired a less pigmented skin. The formation of the skeleton and tissue remained the same. The own linguistic family of the Egyptians, the african-Asiatic, descended from the same mother tongue that European languages, and has nothing to do with languages ââof sub-Saharan Africa. The first color picture of a white man appeared in Italy in Etruscan paintings. Later, with the military rise of Latinos, that would make up the Romans, they are portrayed as predominantly white (some were dark as well as showing pictures of Pompeii). For Northern Europeans, the face is different, as can be seen in the very actors in this film, the eyes are more pulled and the wider nose, due to the large mass of mixed immigration coming from North Asia, notably the Yamna culture and Kurgan, which brought in addition to these features, eye and hair color to Europe. The most appropriate would be the use of actors in the region, namely the Mediterranean as a whole, because it is the closest you can get to the real Egyptians, the Egyptians we see in the paintings, the statues, the mummies, etc., without using Tribal anonymous, thus maintaining a equiplÃ­brio between accuracy and quality of work.",1,0,Raul Almeida,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.07266156462585036,2015-12-11 22:58:06,True,True

2015-12-12T22:38:47,"Interesting comments; Egyptians were light and dark complected with many in between. The sun is not inhibited throughout must of Africa: it's Greek for ""the land of the Sun"", unless I'm wrong. Many long term inhabitants of Greece are quite dark (olive possessing the ability to tan darkly) and do not easily burn in the sun; the Greeks differentiated between North Africa and Greece, noting less cloud cover.   It would be easy to suppose that the lightest Ancient Egyptians had the ability to tan (were olive), most would probably be naturally tan (and quite dark when they were outside for long periods of time) and the darkest were similar to darker Nubians south of Upper Egypt (southern Egypt was the origin). Really, I believe the Egyptians were quite a mix of people (much like everywhere else, but we forget).  Having Brazilian people, or Latin people would not be wrong; having darker African people play them would not be wrong; having Europeans that tan darkly play some of them would not be wrong; lightening the entire population too drastically would ignore the natural climate and suggest that an invading army had success or a drastic migration recently occurred..

Also, if it wanted to be accurate, no one knew the ethnicity of the Egyptians way back then. Third, why complain here when, in the Thor movies, Heimdall was portrayed by a Black man, you guys didn't complain then. Here's my response:  People did throw a hissy fit when Heimdall was portrays by Idris Elba. Now, imagine how much more pissed they'd be if it was reversed. ALL THE NORSE gods were Black, and only Heimdall was White. Weird right? Okay, that's what's going on here so ... yeah. Stop making excuses for Hollywood. One token casting here and there doesn't forgive each time a ""MAIN CHARACTER"" is played by someone of an ethnicity that off. Particularly caucasian because, they have tons of starring roles already and a long history of already bumping off minorities to play the role of minorities. So yeah. it's also about sharing. Once again, they assume recognizable white actors would draw in more audiences and that's all there is too it. They don't care how offensive and odd the casting is. Myself, I'm pretty forgiving.

Maybe they did it because they liked those actors, maybe they hired them because they offered the role to Egyptian actors and actresses, but they said no. You have no idea, so when you get mad because white people play characters of a different race, that's an automatic assumption and negative reactionÂ triggered by the color of one's skin. AKA, racism.Â This is going to be a crappy, but fun and FICTIONALÂ movie that will get most of its money in DVD/Blu-ray sales. They aren't worried about being accurate, so why should you? What have they done that's sooooooooo offensive? I don't get offended when black washed, or Asian washed, or Indian washed movies come out. Fuckin hell. If you can't enjoy the movie becauseÂ youÂ preferÂ color of someone's skin over the color of someone else's, you are racist.

2015-12-15T13:31:04,"I want to state something, but hear me out first. Its True, that Egyptians were Africans, and were mostly black, but all the Egyptian Gods were never depicted as blacks because in that time period, it was seen as superior to be light skinned over dark skinned. Its true that the movie definitely needed a more diverse cast, or should've just done a better job with makeup and costuming, because there were no Blonde Gods. As for the accents, almost every movie that bases their story in an ancient time uses a British Accent, for all Greek movies, Brit accents are used. Of course there is no justification for not having a more historically correct depiction, but I think the directors kinda just overlooked it in place for alot of CGI and Jaime Lannister.   I'd personally still watch it for the action because I'm a sucker to Egpytian and Greek Mythology brought to life. I think I've watched Clash of the Titans like 5 times even though its shitty.

Nothing new here, let me school you all on the ORIGINAL BLACK EGYPTIANS, that they have replaced with whites!!!!!!!!!!  The Black Egyptians are the original settlers of Kemet, better known as Egypt. ""The native Sudanese are one of the original pigmented Arabs in that region. They are members of the same ethnic family with the ancient Egyptians, the Ethiopians, the Southern Arabians, and the primitive inhabitants of Babylon. They are all FOUNDERS and sustainers of the mighty Nilotic civilization we still admire today.  They are very great nation of Blacks, who did rule almost over all Africa and Asia in a very remote era, in fact beyond the reach of history of any of our records.  ======Egypt is a Greek word meaning âBlack"": - The Egyptians of the Bible were Negroid. - The Bible says both Egyptians and Ethiopians are descendants of Ham. - Arabs invaded Egypt in the 7th Century AD; Remember, Egypt wasn't invaded by Rome until 300 BC.  The Bible dates 4000 BC.  - Therefore, Arabs have no more connection to Ancient Egypt than Europeans have to Ancient America. Now, that's a real go back to Europe starter kit for yall you white racist out there. - Egyptian is an Afro-Asiatic language.  (AFRO, AFRO) - The national language of modern day Egypt is Egyptian Arabic, which gradually replaced Coptic.  (Coptic--Ethiopia) - Black Egyptians were eventually mixed with invading Libyans, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Turks, Arabs and Western Europeans.  That is where the mixed people of the modern-day Arabs come from.  Wanna know even more to hurt the greek/roman pride???   Scholars attribute much of Greece's development would not have been possible if were it not for Kemet, which was established millennias before. The culture called Kemet, also known as Egypt, is the same civilization that built the Sphinx, raised the pyramids and built the world's FIRST libraries also produced the world's first physician, created geometry and astronomy and were among the FIRST to explore the nature of our existence. And they passed their knowledge along to the popular Greeks scholars like Thales, Pluto, Hippocrates, etc. It's well-documented that classical Greeks thinkers traveled to Egypt to expand their knowledge. When the Greek scholars Thales, Hippocrates, Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato and many others traveled to Kemet/Egypt, they studied at the temple-universities. of Kemet.",5,3,MirrorEffect,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.11041991341991342,2015-12-19 12:59:27,True,True

With the kind of money film companies have these days you'd expect an element of authenticity to their films. Lets hope they've at least consulted experts with this myth.

This has been proven genetically, geographically and archaeologically, but just because Somalia is a lesser known country with a lesser population it's refused to be credited it with it's Undervalued and Rich History. I must also admit that this is partially SOME Somalis fault as they refuse history that pre-dates Islam which they consider ""Non-Islamic"" which is pretty Sad. Now my post is obviously contradictory to the infamous ""Somalis = Black +Arab"" myth which is a poor and desperate attempt to explain the features of Somalis and why Somalis range from lightish tan to brown skin with their particular Hair textures. This however doesn't include other East Africans like the inhabitants of Uganda which is relatively close to Somalia and Kenya which borders Somalia since they don't share the Same features/blood.",0,0,soul5,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.0038461538461538464,2015-12-21 06:47:04,True,True

The statues of a lot of pharaons actally paint them with blue eyes.  So yes, the movie seems wrong, not because the protagoists are caucasian, but because there is a lack of other races.

Only because she's the only white figure Eurocentrists can cling to. Queen Tiye, Hatsheput and Nefertiti are much more accomplished. Egypt has 5,000 years of history. FIVE THOUSAND. Cleopatra is closer in age to people living TODAY then she was to Egyptians in 3500 B.C. yet, white people focus on her. That's like taking an American History class focusing on American History from 1995 - 2015. Ignore the thousands of years of Egyptian rule before the Ottomans, Assyrians, Arabs, Greeks, Romans and Persians came. America hasn't even been around for 300 years. England has only been around 1,200 years. Yet whites want to dismiss 2,500 - 3,000 years of Egyptian history pre-colonization to focus on the only white figure they can cling to. Another thing....FIVE THOUSAND years is a long time. White people can't comprehend how a population can change. How it was black in ancient times but, arab/middle eastern now. What was North America FIVE THOUSAND years ago? Filled with native americans. Not a white person in sight. It's like you have to try to be that dense. I mean the Egyptians themselves tell you they come from Punt, which is assumed to be somewhere in modern day East Africa, a region that's heavily implied to have been where the Garden of Eden was in the Bible, as well as where scientists continue to find the oldest human fossils. The entire region is filled with mountains and the mouth of the Nile River starts there in the high lands flowing downward up into Egypt. Common sense would tell you that Africans followed this water source down the mountains into the northern tip of Africa, forming a civilization there due to the fertile soil. But that's common sense. Instead white people came back down from Europe. Even to this day there are black Africans living in Southern/Upper Egypt yet, none of these mythical white people are there.

The classical view concerning Egypt and race (which let's remember is a social construct) is that Semitic speaking people's came down from around the areas of northern Arabia and brought their language to a North African (i.e. Black & Berber) population.  We have their physical remains, we've had them since the late 1800s - dry sand is very forgiving to artifacts and dead bodies.  These corpse-burying semites formed a ruling elite for a while, and were eventually absorbed by a wider black population (on account of recessive genes), leaving Egypt as a giant melting pot when it comes to skin colour, religion, and language...    Let's not forget, Egypt = the Nile, which is massive and stretches very far south into the heart of Nubia, and all the way to the mediterranean basin in the north, which was largely sailed by traders of Old Europe, the Levant and North Africa.  There were [at least] 3000 years of Egyptian history before Cleopatra, and LOTS can happen in that time: Hyksos (semitic) invasions, Nubian/Kushite invasions, Assyrian & Persian invasions, Greek invasions, and so forth.  Egypt had, and currently has no 'race', get over yourselves.  Ancient Egypt is not an unchangeable cultural monolith; it is not a platonic archetype in the sky; it was not white, it was not black, it was not 'multicultural' - these are all modern notions which had no meaning back then, and should not be retro-projected onto the past for our own self-legitimacy.",3,0,The Modern Hermeticist,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.013162845385067607,2015-12-28 16:09:31,True,True

Egypt's Pharaohs LOVED it's gold and jewels etc BUT as for Gods looking like bejeweled beings? Sorry, but no, I know they love their shiny objects but this goes too far even for Gods, we are shown that the Gods were more simple, if they had a human form it would of been more anthropomorphic humans (so Anubis would be a fur covered Jackal humanoid looking character) but with a collar of gold etc, simple but still showing their regal side this just looks like it is Gods set in the Ancient Egyptian days but with armor that should be in something futuristic.   The fight between Horus and Set in which Set ripped out Horus's eye (if you go with one versions of the myth) would have NOT been fought with armor like that, it would of been fought with more armor that was more simple yet powerful not with this crap, it is WAY too futuristic. it makes a pretty film but not exactly a great interpretation of the way the Gods are, but then again this IS Hollywood so...",0,0,TheLostLenore,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.11458333333333331,2015-12-29 17:45:35,True,True

2015-12-31T03:45:35,"Ive been waiting for a movie about ""Egyptian mythology"" It looks amazing however I'm getting so tired of white people ( directors, producers ) insinuating themselves or their likeness into a culture and a civilization that did not have a white face in it, Egypt = Africa, Egypt is also a melting pot of different cultures of color, that would be black, Arabic, and surrounding countries and mix race people who would of been brown or lightskined meaning lightskin black or arab, not white. Its offensive and disrespectful. And for the idiots that keep on justifying a whitewash movie, by pointing out the fact that in today's movies black characters play white characters and no one saying anything about it is not true, 1) there has been controversial issues about the girl who played Rue in The Hunger Games being a female of color. 2) as a man of color I was disappointed with the honeymooners who were white characters that should have been played by white characters, 3) I'm an avid marvel comic reader nick fury and the Human Torch are white and should have stayed that way, in this day in age there are too many black superheroes to change white ones to black ones, when directors and producers can just make a black superhero movie. 4) since the beginning of the movie industry, directors and producers have been whitewashing movies example The King and I was a great movie and even though they painted the King brown the fact of the matter is it was still a white man underneath that make up. 5) Last but not lease a sad reality, movie producer / directors make movies to target a specific demographic, especially when it's a big budget movie, and more then enough white people dont want to see black people on the silver screen.......................................

If you see a black man walking in the street of Egypt then he is not Egyptian, Probably from Sudan, or descends from the Arabic peninsula or from the very lower part of Egypt which is  Aswan and the people who live there are not the descendants of Ancient Egyptians, they are actually tribes of another Ancient culture who actually have their own language that they have managed to preserve.

2016-01-24T14:25:45,"The case most comments are arguing about here is whether ancient Egyptians were black or not. Well, let me tell you something, IT IS A GOD DAMN MOVIE. It is all about fiction and entertainment and there is no real history in describing the Ancient Egyptian MYTHOLOGY. Because the gods of Egypt were depicted in many skin tones, white, bronze, red toned, black, very black as in the black of a matte car finish and even blue and green. About Egyptians, it frustrates me to assume that Egyptians were black as in Ethiopian black or African American black, because first of all, I am Egyptian and I know how my people look like. Yes, I can hear you over there, the one who is saying modern Egyptians are not like Ancient Egyptians, due to the successive invasions and racial mixing and blah blah blah... But here is what you don't know, there are several villages in Egypt, in upper Egypt to be exact, the place of ancient Egyptians, that are very much like closed societies, they marry from each other, they don't mix with other outsiders. Maybe those resemble Ancient Egyptians to some extent and they have kinda mocha colored skin, like Latinos. And if you gonna depend it on the facial features of the statues and ancient Egyptian drawings, I gotta tell you that I see Egyptians everyday that have very curly thick hair, big nostrils and thick lips, but have light skin. Modern Egyptians have a complexion that is very dark in outdoor summer days and white in winter nights. I have a bronze mocha face and hands, while full body is like light Latte with a pinkish tone. And from a geographical point of view, Ancient Egyptians should not be compared to Deep Savanna's Africans, because Egypt is not on the equator and just because it is a desert doesn't mean it should have black people. The temperature in Egypt normally range between 30 degrees celsius in summer days and 8 degrees celsius in winter nights ( sometimes in rare occasions reaching 45 in summer and 1.5 in winter ), It is not like the Equator in Africa where the lowest temperature is 20 degrees. The climate in Egypt is very fluctuating from season to season, so from an evolutionary perspective, Ancient Egyptians should have more light skin, because there is not much heat all year round to affect their coloration, they should have some body hair to protect them in winter (unlike Black Africans who have scarce body or facial hair). And no offence meant here, but Ancient Egyptians were pretty advanced compared to any body in their time, and way more advanced than any African culture been until the 20th century. They didn't acquire their knowledge and development overnight. They went through thousands of years of development, before they could build the first pyramid which was build 7000 years ago.

This referred to the fertile soil of the Nile valley. Sometimes an opposite denotation was applied; Deshret, meaning ""Red land."" This referred to the desert, which also back then was the dominant landscape of the Egyptian territory. these are the periods Egypt was in, early, old kingdom,First Intermediate,Middle Kingdom,Second Intermediate,New Kingdom,Third Intermediate,Late Period,Ptolemaic (Hellenistic) now at the end of the old kingdom the black population had died off and yes Egypt was mostly black at that point but not by majority  by first intermediate Libyans and and Greeks and even Carthaginians and Galatians started moving in but then molded the country into a new ethic people that where now then Egyptians not kemet. the people of Kemet where dieing off long before any intervention from others by 8,000 bc and the population never recovered and to top it off they never went as for north as Diopolis a city in South Egypt. When the new and now official common Egypt formed there where Egyptians and then Nubian's, Ethiopians and many other people including easterners but now lets look at the gods Egypt held onto the gods but even more Bizarre they mixed them with the Hellenic gods as well such as Zeus or as the Egyptians would say Ammon Zues. if someone wants to debate this with me thats cool but dont just say the Egyptians where black or Arab or whatever remember Africa does not mean black people for example( Carthage) look it up . also if anyone wants the info ive gathered id be happy to send it",0,2,Rudolf Kepler,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.13899087024087026,2016-01-29 11:26:34,True,True

2016-02-04T10:33:03,"People! people! Why must we always have the same silly argument? We will live and die with topics that consistently separate us. If I were to acknowledge my ethnic background, I will surely loose credibility to one or the other group.  The only way to come to the truth is by educating ourselves to what is factually true. What is factually and scientifically true is  that all of mankind derives from one blood line. According to science, the origins of man starts in Africa with a man of color. What is factually true is that Africa is the most diverse continent on earth. What some call ""black"" is not only designated for those in the sub-Saharan parts of the continent.  Now, most would say that the so called ""black race"" comes from Noah's son Ham, and that he was cursed to be the servants of his brothers. The bible actually says that Ham's son, Canaan will be cursed. But with that being said, we can actually trace the lineage of the so called black to Ham's sons, Kush (ethiopia) which also means burnt skin, Phut or (Put) which is today's Libya, Salum, which is today's Jerusalum, and Mizriam, which is Egypt. Now, If it is true that Ham is the father of what man calls the black race, then why wouldn't Ham's sons not be black like their father?   Also, If science is true and accurate, hows does a non-black man produce the genes of a black man when science says that brown eyes and dark skin is dominant versus lighter skin and eyes being the recessive traits? If we choose to read the bible and with accept the book as being authentic, we would find that until the time of Noah and the building of the ark was the first and only time that the world experienced rain. If there is no rain, then there isn't snow, and if there isn't snow then there isn't ice. the climate was likely tropical and sunny. People would have need the melanin in their skin for protection. the skin that we call white was more suitable for a cooler climate which allowed the skin to absorb the sun rays for vitamin D.   In college, one of my math professors was from Egypt; she looked very similar to my aunt. A Black Egyptian by the name of Mostafa Hefney said that Egypt is a black and brown nation. He stated that he classified himself as an Arab Muslim. He also stated that the Arabs are a black ethnic group. When ask about whites in Egypt, Hefney stated that whites came to Egypt during the Roman and Greek empires and mixed with a small population of the people. If we follow history, the Greek and the Roman empire did not arrive until the new testament according to the bible. This would mean that a black ethic group built the pyramids and structures in Ethiopia, the Sudan as well as Egypt a thousand years before whites came along. And according to history, the Arabs were the last to invade and remain today along with the original inhabitants. We must not forget Hams grandson Nimrod. According to the bible, Nimrod found favor in the eyes of God and established his empire by building the tower of babel in Modern day Babylon Iraq.   Hefney stated that when he immigrated to America, his papers classified him as being Caucasian. In his documentary, Hefney stated that is has been acknowledged by the Greek philosophers and scholars that Egypt is a black nation. Later, an English scholar refused to accept that black Africans possessed the ability to create the pyramids so he re-classified the Middle East and Northern Africa as being dark skinned Caucasian.  Hefney, who is a PHD here in America has a pending court decision on rather the U.S. courts will re-classify Hefney as being a Black Egyptian.  If you choose not to believe what I am saying, just post factual information the can refute what I have stated, and If you want references start with the black Egyptian by the name of Mostafa Hefney. You can also read the work and findings from Professor Ivan Van Sertima. and lastly, read the work of Yosef Ben Johannon, he is an Ethiopian Jew. Lastly, we should all be appalled at the so called education that Western civilization offers. Our educational system seems to be structured to acknowledge only European and American accomplishments. We quickly forget the omission of people of color and their contributions to the world. For entertainment sake, yes I may see the movie, but when has there ever been a white historical figure played by a black man? never, so why should blacks get over and accept the white washing of Egypt? remember, Ethiopians doesn't look like the Bushman, Black Americans does not look exactly like black Africans. Somalians does not look like Libyans, Nigerians don't quite look like South Africans, and non of them quite look like the  200 million blacks that are currently in South America and the Caribbeans. All of these different ethnic groups, all share black African blood. If they are not black, they are all African by blood, not Caucasian.",0,0,Don Hogan,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.03124963578088579,2016-02-04 10:33:03,True,True

You are a dumb delusional fool if you think the reason why these directors chose white actors was because it would've made the movie more profitable, especially when you have black actors that is just as credible and just as talented! Having a majority white cast actually lost them profit since the movie is banned in certain countries because of its historical inaccuracy so that profit excuse is irrelevant and prove you dont know WTF you're talking about. Hell, you could've had Chris Brown play in the damn movie and everybody and mom, daddy, aunties, uncles, sisters, and brothers, white, black, brown, blue and purple would've watched the damn movie! This was just another way for Jewish Hollywood to whitewash history because of their obvious insecurities.

2016-02-13T02:46:06,"I wanted to remain quiet, but seeing the level of idiocy festering in this comment chain became overbearing, and I mean from both sides. Firstly none of you have a basic understanding of biology, arguing ""BLACK, WHITE, YABADABA DOOO."" Race is a social construct that became prevalent at the turn of the 15th century, orchestrated by the Spanish right around the time Columbus allegedly ""rediscovered"" America. The Spanish used race as a way to classify superiority, the lighter the skin the more intelligent and civilized, the darker vice versa- then when western Europe arose from the depth of chaos and began world domination they too indoctrinated racial classifications. With the recent discovery of haplogroups biologist have finally dispelled race as anything biological, that fallacy has been burned to the ground, RACE DOES NOT EXIST IN A BIOLOGICAL SENSE. There is more DNA diversity in west African villages alone, than between Africa and Europe. What race does identify is our evolution in respected geographical locations, that is all, we all belong to one species and one race: homosapiens and human.           Now moving to the matter of what ""color"" the actual Egyptians were, not the offspring of invaders we have now. Egyptians were dark skinned Africans, as all of Africans were dark skin. Not as dark as sub saharan africans but the lightest most likely being my complexion, as unbiased greek philosophers describe. Why? That's easy, were they evolved. Africa having a more mild to hot climate, and being closer to the equator caused the adaptation of dark skin, that's just how the people acclimated to that niche. Europe being more north and colder, also due to their enclosure in caves, is what led to their pale skin. The difference is also shown in Southeast Asians vs Northwest Asians. Arabs are mulattos, just like now Egyptians, North Africa and Northeast Africa suffered millennia of invasions from Europe, which led to the mixture of features and lighter skin. Returning to the Sumerian epoch, they too were dark as the ""middle eastern"" climate is very similar to North African climate, which should disseminate any confusion as to why ancient Middle Easterners would be light and not Egyptians.      Lastly stop trying to separate Africa into categories, it's funny how they always divide Africa in terms of civilization, but not Europe. Southern Europe and North Europe didn't have the same accomplishments, why don't we classify Greece and Rome as Southern European achievements instead of ""European"" it's nothing but another diminutive tactic Europeans use called ""divide and conquer."" Egypt is in Africa, an African achievement, and represents all of Africa (as well as Greece being a European achievement), just as subsaharan Africa had many great civilizations, one being the Axum Empire which was a world superpower in it's prime, but not many of you would know that. Arabs stop trying to claim Egypt, it was not a Arab civilization, you guys came in at 700AD, no earlier. You guys don't want to be considered African until Egypt is brought up, then all of a sudden you're jumping the band wagon. Want to be a part of Africa then admit that the middle east is still Africa, I don't know why it changed from North East Africa into the Middle East, probably just another way to separate Africans.      Also I saw a lot of that ""Ramses had a picture of him killing hundreds of Nubians."" If you people had any eruditeness in Egypt's antiquity you'd know that yes, Egyptians and Nubians engaged in many conflicts, as have all civilizations, conflict has been a part of the world since recorded history, you'd also know that King Nermer united Egypt and Nubia initiating Egypt's ""golden age"" which is what most people know Egypt by, because it's also the time that the pyramids were constructed sometime around 3500BCE and 2500 BCE. Also Egyptians believe that the originated from Somalia, which the called the land of Punt, or something of the sort, meaning the holy land. And what do Somalians look like??? Thank you. I swear racism breed the biggest idiots, how can you be so hateful you, obfuscate, fabricate, and just plain lie in order to eradicate African achievements? Yes Africa has had many great civilizations, were a great people, AND STILL ARE. I'm african and proud, if I was born European I'd be proud, be proud of your ancestry and stop stealing others. That's the only way to truly deconstruct racism.  EDIT: Will not be replying to comments.",138,55,rich polit,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.1325305662805663,2016-02-13 02:46:06,True,True

Black and White are social constructs used for segregation, discrimination, and trying to make one color seem superior or inferior to another.   Egyptians are definitely people of color, and even the ""whitest"" Egyptian (especially back then probably wouldn't have looked like anyone from this cast). BUT, it wouldn't be historically accurate to use an all Ghanaian or Nigerian cast either. One man named Ham (son of Noah) is the father of Egyptians, Libyans, Ethiopians, Nubians, and more. That's many shades of people on one huge continent just from one man, and he was only one of Noah's sons (smh I just opened the gate for Bible hating trolls). I'm saying all this to say that there is more than just ""black and white"". Scientifically, we are all one race (human).   The problem isn't the casting as much as it is White Supremacy, which goes beyond just Hollywood. I'm not talking about KKK White Supremacy; I'm talking about the idea that White/European is more acceptable, beautiful, intelligent looking, safer looking, heroic, easier to stomach, etc...... than any other ""race"" or nationality. White Supremacy can be very subtle. It is why there are more pictures of a European looking Jesus than there are pictures of a Hebrew, Palestinian, or Middle Eastern looking Jesus.

If you become a movie maker, I dare you to make every goddamn movie you ever make historically, ethnically and periodically accurate, answer is you won't be able to.  And as an Egyptian, I felt so happy a movie like this is happening because I have never seen a good movie about Egyptian mythology before, and the last good one I saw was the Mummy and it wasn't about the gods too. Dozens of movies are about Greek mythology, zero about Egypt, which has an older history and was more advanced than them. So, this movie is a first of its kind and I am devastated a movie like this will fail not because of its story nor its production or acting, but because some ethnic groups got butthurt because they felt as if the movie makers were their girlfriends and they betrayed them by sleeping with a white girl.  P.S: even if it was made with Black actors it won't be historically accurate because they will be African American people and Egyptians never looked like African Americans. So I think it would have been better if they made it with Egyptian actors, but wait a minute, Egyptians are also light colored, oh, ok then, let's make another movie about Greeks, that will be something -_-",0,0,OS Alpha,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.20151515151515156,2016-02-26 17:52:50,False,True

B) Egypt is a sub-Saharan country that stands at a meeting point between east Africa, Arabia and East Europe. So, it is safe to presume they were also a mix of races not a single one, since drawings and statues portray them in different skin colors ranging from beige to dark brown.  C) Egyptians were people living in oases in the desert and then they moved to the Nile valley and began their civilization there, so they weren't Africans coming from central Africa as most people think, you wanna know why, because it is completely illogical to leave the forests and green lands of Central Africa and Travel to the scarce harsh environment of the Sahara Desert to start a civilization there.  D) Even if the movie is made in America, it doesn't mean that only America will watch it.

It's offensive to me when people say my ancestors were ""black"" because they very most likely looked like modern-day Egyptians, who are neither ""black"" nor ""white"". Ancient Egyptians did not portray themselves as black, in ancient Egyptian art, they differentiated themselves from Nubians by painting Nubians darker than Egyptians (As a side note, Nubians are an ethnic group that mostly resides within the borders of modern-day Egypt, so today, they are as much Egyptians as anyone else, even though they still maintain a separate culture, language and ethnicity. However, in ancient times, they were a separate nation from the Ancient Egyptians, so this demonstrates how both ethnic groups have been mostly maintained from ancient times).   We are Semitic people but not Arabs. Arabic is the main language in Egypt today, but historically, Arabs are an ethnic group separate from ancient Egyptians.   This categorization based on skin colour doesn't even make much sense, Ethiopians are also semitic people, but are still considered ""black"" today, even though they look very different from West Africans, and probably share more biological similarities with Egyptians than with West Africans. The only reason to be having the debate about what colour the skin of Ancient Egyptians was, is to determine who best to represent the true ancient Egyptians in film, and it definitely makes a lot more sense to use modern Egyptians, who are no doubt the closest biological descendants of ancient Egyptians. Even using other semitic people (other North Africans, Arabs, Ethiopians, etc.) would make sense, however it makes just as little sense to use West Africans to portray Ancient Egyptians (the majority of ""African-Americans"" are originally from West Africa) as it does to use white Europeans.",3,0,Momera,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.15694444444444444,2016-02-27 18:10:15,False,True

Everyone is mad that a bunch of the actors are of European or american nationality, and that it's racist to cast ""white"" people into what should be ""black"" roles.  Take a minute and think about exactly what that means. It would be more racist to deny an actor the chance to play a character in this movie because they have lighter skin than it is to have a cast including white people in a historical based fantasy culture set in northern Africa.  What would be racist is an ethnic divide among the cast, something like the villains are all dark skinned and the heroes are all European, something blatantly not apparent here.  People who are mad about European, American, and Australian actors being part of a film that is supposed to take place in a predominantly darker skinned culture are not being racial defenders like they think they are. Not only do they sound whiny and boring, they themselves are actually the ones being racist- except against the people in this movie who do not fit the demographic they decide to impose upon this action/fantasy movie. They are condemning casting directors for choosing white actors for roles that it is assumed should be for darker skinned actors, and actors for accepting to play these parts.   That is a big part of what the modern view of racism is; the denial of opportunities for and judgement of people based on the color of their skin and not the content of their character, or in this case, their prowess as actors.",0,0,Vaerthelmn 52,IJBnK2wNQSo,-0.06006944444444443,2016-03-01 02:17:39,False,True

I am not a rasist, but since there is such a discussion about white and black gods could you tell me please: what black facial features have you seen/found on egyptian reliefs/pictures/art where you can clearly see white skin people, brown skin people, with caucasian/white facial feature sometimes with blue eyes? We can see that black people on pictures are shown absolutely separately and very clearly shown with all the lineament of black people ('egyptians' were quite pedantic as we can see about characteristic and peculiarities of what they were portraying and depicting).  There are also some people/gods WITH BLUE SKIN, which reminds us about India and Indian Gods at all, so we should say they were BLUE? See Nefertiti, Tutankhamun and others (sumerian, greek, 'egyptian' gods) who had nothing to do with black skin or facial features.   White people get brown on the sun as you might know and there is no wonder why they are pictured like that (clearly white or brown) and what are you complaining about if we DO NOT even KNOW what FACE THEY HAD since MOST OF THEM ARE PORTRAYED WITH MASKS.  Also please note that you can find traditions and knowledge about Gods all around the Earth and if you look at South America you will discover that indians had their gods as well and it is worth mentioning that when Cortes arrived to America indians where they saw him thought that he was a God - he was white, had beard and etc.    Have you read any kind of chronicles (including Sumerians, myths of ancient Greece) where you can clearly see facial features, beards of white men, their hair and etc.?   This is a movie and an attemp to create a picture of how it happened. How do we ALL know what gods looked like, it was thousands of years ago and these years were full of wars, migrations, invasions? Most of the argument is geography, then it starts to be suspicious and seems to become rasist towards white people.  STOP BLINDLY BELIEVE in what we were told in school and start thinking and analysing by your own. Arab people are not the same who were on this territory thousands of years ago, even if you want it to be so. People don't always belong to the place they live in, so naming them by the place, territory they are in would be sometimes a mistake. Geography is not a nationality/race.   Most likely GODS WERE CLOSER TO WHITE, even if it is hard to accept for many people now.

I believe the civilians of Egypt were castes correctly because it was very diverse. The movie is actually so good you get over the racial issue and connect with the characters. Also, when the Greeks came that added to the population of Egypt, even Cleopatra is half Greek half Egyptian with a bit of Macedonian descent. Nobody really knows what color they were because it isn't one shade, because some mummies have red and blond hair (though they did use henna back then to dye the hair). Essentially, my only issue was that everything except the main characters were diverse. Nobody in the cast is Egyptian, as it says on IMDB.

Also based on the fact it is a ""fictional"" movie set in an ""alternate universe"" where the world is flat , race of actors doesn't seem like it should be a serious issue, I think just the same with Star Wars or any other movie that uses diversity in casting (I'm all for it with race & gender) , even when Fox did their ""Grease Live"" everyone was supposed to be ok with it (most of us were) but suddenly with this movie it is an issue. I have issue with race as long as their race isn't portrayed as a stereotype or it is derogatory in anyway. I'm more worried about the acting.Lets face it either 300 film, Immortals, Clash of the Titans or Wrath of the Titans not only had just as much CGI but you are hard pressed to find actual Greek or even Mediterranean actors in them. So why is this one a big deal? Again the film is set in an alternate universe where the world is flat, it's not a historically accurate film by any means going in.",0,0,Theodore Wolf,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.03793706293706294,2016-03-14 12:17:55,False,True

It is correct to question a predominantly all white cast but not right either to suggest that all ancient Egyptians were black. There were some leading black rulers and many white ones including some with red hair and of Celtic origin. To replace one racial statement with an opposing but still racial alternative is just as incorrect and reflects modern influences including ill informed educational bias. I agree the movie makers did not think through sufficiently the casting of this movie but as intimated replacing one lie with another is not the answer.

This is so true in 47 Ronin and the Last Samurai, where the main hero is white and the rest of the characters are Japanese - showing that other races are only good for assisting the white man's fantasy.

Seth invites Horus to a party and convinces the teenage Horus to drink more than Horus could normally cope with. When Horus is drunk, Seth seduces him to sleep over the night in one bed together. When lying together in one bed, Seth grabs Horus and rapes him. But Horus has tricked Seth; his drunkenness was staged. He catches Seth's semen with his hands and hides it. Next morning, Horus runs to his Mother, Isis, to tell her what happened. Isis is first speechless with rage and disbelief. Then she decides to return the like on Seth: she cuts off Horus' hand and lubricates Seth's semen on Seth's favorite food (Egyptian lettuce). Totally clueless, Seth eats the manipulated lettuce, then he goes to the divine court to inform on Horus. At first, the divine judges swear at Horus, but when Thot, the scribe of the court, calls for Seth's semen to come out of the body of Horus, the semen instead comes out of the body of Seth. Seth blushes in embarrassment and shock, then flees. Horus is acquitted """,2,3,Ali Bedar,IJBnK2wNQSo,-0.00454545454545453,2016-05-24 13:23:19,False,True

I really love how they made the ""godly"" form coenside with the Egyptian descriptions and that not all of them transformed the same way or not at all is very creative. The journey and plot are really well planned and simple but not too simple. The civilization design and incorporation of religous beleifs/descriptons are original with a hint of moderncy. The personalities in the characters were very well acted and showing that even gods can have faults is really cool.

2016-06-17T03:51:12,"Yes, I do agree that the director could have had better visual effects and different colored toned actors and actresses, but I still enjoyed the movie very much. I myself, is obsessed with Egyptian Mythology. Reading the story about the fight between Horus and Set about a million times, I could see why some people didn't care for it as much as they were hoping too. Lets start with the first basic fact, Horus lost only one eye. Not two, one. Even before the fight between Horus and Set, Set cut Osiris into 14 pieces and spread them across Egypt. I know that Horus mentioned it later on in the movie, but the director and writer also did forget another important fact. Isis did not commit suicide, she searched all the pieces of Osiris, brought them together to Anubis, and Anubis made the first mummy. In my opinion, not being a critique either, I thought the effects were decent! Best Egyptian movie I'v seen so far, in my opinion. I was so happy to see this movie and they didn't let me down besides the fact that they out some important facts. I think ""Gods of Egypt"" should have better reviews and people should look on the positive side! Some one finally found the time to create and Egyptian Mythology movie! I also have been seeing comments of how the actors shouldn't be white and more Egyptian. Well, it would honestly kinda be hard to find actors from the middle east to act in an American made movie.

2016-06-19T10:36:28,"I watched this film recently and... yeaaaaaah. It's not awful, like some would have you believe, there are some good qualities, but the majority of the film is pretty much a mess. The pacing in this film is far too fast for me, it's like they're trying to squeeze and obscene amount of lore into the film that either wasn't needed or could have been kept aside. The main human character (can't even remember his name) is not only a poor character (he has like no personality) but isn't acted that well. The actor was pretty stiff throughout and I felt more effort was needed there. The effects looked pretty awful. I know it's fun for the Gods to transform into animal forms but it's essentially pointless and I feel we could have just had good human form fights. I think there needed to be less attention there, the long shots looked gorgeous though. The plot is a bit all over the place, a bit clunky. But I think the film is saved by Gerard Butler and Nikolaj Coster-Waldu. The two of them hand in some really good performances regarding how weak the script is. Nikolaj's character (probably the main one too) lacks some depth or sense of loss I would love him to have but Nikolaj still hands in a really well acted performance and Gerard Butler, whenever he's on screen, is so much of a manly villain it's just fun to watch. Like I said, there's many down sides to this film, including pointless scenes I class as filler, but it's certainly not awful.  (EDIT): I feel like there is a really solid and good idea beneath the poor pacing, effects, characterisation and cramped in lore, I think if people had really cared about this film they would have looked through, cut the pieces that weren't needed, and perhaps handed in a good film. I keep asking whether the Gods really needed to be that tall or transform into those creatures. I get it looks cool or something, but it cripples the film in my opinion. A lot of money could have been spared if it was just human form fighting human form. I dunno, I feel there's certainly a strong film somewhere in there, but it's hidden beneath a lot of crap.",6,2,Raymondo,IJBnK2wNQSo,0.1274672187715666,2016-06-19 10:36:28,False,False

As an artist and writer, I've seen the setting taken place in Egypt due to temples, pyramids and palaces and clothes the actors are wearing. But there is something wrong, I've expect the gods to be more animal like just the pictures we've seen in Egyptology instead of like transformers, their sizes can be ten times more than any human being, gods don't bleed blood so there should be no golden blood from them, and they forgot that gods cannot die because of one big thing all gods and goddesses in the universe should had: immortality. And one more thing...the sphinx not a being made out of sand. The sphinx should be a living animal of flesh and blood as well as enchantment. And people are criticizing because the actors in the film aren't Egyptians but British, European and American people and not speaking Egyptian language. But I think it shouldn't matter because its for english people and was made by an english person. Can people just enjoy the movie and not be so negative about it just because it didn't look like the history of Egypt.

That's my PERSONAL opinion. You may have not liked it at all.   And the movie has some things that are wrong (such as there are three pyramids in the movie already. But the first pyramid wasn't build until way later). There are many more wrong things but I still enjoyed it. That being said, uneducated people are everywhere in this comment section lol. Why are you trying to sell history when you don't even know what you're talking about?   Seriously stop trying to convert everything into race. Not everything has racism in it. Although maybe, instead of having just one black God, there should have been a fewer darker ones. But still, there should also be fair ones and golden ones.   To the people saying that the Gods of Egypt should be black or Arabian only, you're seriously so uneducated people. First of all, Arab didn't exist until thousands of years after the Egyptian Gods so shut up with the Arabic arguments. Also, the original descendants of Egypt were Coptic. And the Coptic language came after hieroglyphics so that in it speaks for itself.  They consisted of all colors, and facial features. Coptic descendants have a bit of a golden skin tone but they are not black and that's definite. Search it up in the library if you don't believe me.  Not all of Egypt was filled with black people back then. Although today, it contains most African-Americans. The Gods are portrayed mostly correct, except maybe the blonde hair.

2017-08-12T06:55:11,"FOR ALL THE IDIOTS WHO THINK THE EGYPTIAN WHERE POC... they were fucking white, get over it.  First of all, 70% of white british men have dna lineage which traces back directly to king tut (tutankhamun) who has caucasoid (white) DNA  The mummy of the wife of King Tutankhamen has auburn hair.   The mummies of Rameses II and Prince Yuaa have fine silky yellow hair. The mummy of another pharaoh, Thothmes II, has light chestnut-colored hair.   a leading British anthropological journal states that many mummies have dark reddish-brownhair. Professor Vacher De Lapouge described a blond mummy found at Al Amrah, which he says has the face and skull measurements of a typical Gaul or Saxon.   The mummy of Queen Tiy has âwavy brown hair.â   British anthropological journal,- ââ Unfortunately, only the mummies of a very few pharaohs have survived to the 20th century, but a large proportion of these are blond. ââ  Amenhotep IIIâs tomb painting shows him as having light red hair. Also, his features are quite caucasian.  A farm scene from around 2000 B.C. in the tomb of the nobleman Meketre shows redheads.   An Egyptian scribe named Kay at Sakkarah around 2500 B.C. has blue eyes.   The Funerary stele (inscribed stone slab)of Priest Remi clearly shows him as having red hair.  The eye of Horus, the so-called Wedjat Eye. is always blue.   A very attractive painting is found on the wall of a private tomb in West Thebes from the 18th Dynasty. The two deceased parents are white people with black hair. Mourning them are two pretty fair-skinned girls with light blond hair and their red-haired older brother.   Queen Thi is painted as having a rosy complexion, blue eyes and blond hair. She was co-ruler with her husband Amenhotep III and it has been said of their rule. âThe reign of Amenhotep III was the culminating point in Egyptian history, for never again, in spite of the exalted effort of the Ramessides, did Egypt occupy so exalted a place among the nations of the world as she had in his time.â   Amenhotep III looks northern European in his statues.   Paintings of people with red hair and blue eyes were found at the tomb of Bagt in Beni Hassan. Many other tombs at Beni Hassan have paintings of individuals with blond and red hair as well as blue eyes.  Paintings of blonds and redheads have been found among the tombs at Thebes.  Blond hair and blue eyes were painted at the tomb of Pharaoh Menphtah in the valley of the Kings.  Paintings from the Third Dynasty show native Egyptians with red hair and blue eyes. They are shepherds, workers and bricklayers.  A blond woman was painted at the tomb of Djeser-ka-ra-seneb in Thebes.  A model of a ship from about 2500 B.C. is manned by five blond sailors.  The god Nuit was painted as white and blond.  A painting at the tomb of Meresankh III at Giza, from about 2485 B.C., shows white skin and red hair.  Two statues from about 2570 B.C., found in the tombs at Medum, show Prince Rahotep and his wife Nofret. He has light green stones for eyes. She has violet-blue stones.  A painting from Itetiâs tomb at Saqqara shows a very Nordic-looking man with blond hair.  Grafton Smith mentions the distinctly red hair of the 18th Dynasty mummy Henutmehet.  Harvard Professor Carleton Coon, in his book THE RACES OF EUROPE, tells us that âmany of the officials, courtiers, and priests, representing the upper class of Egyptian society but not the royalty, looked strikingly like modern Europeans, especially long-headed ones.â (Note: Nordics are long-headed.) Long-headed Europeans are most common in Britain, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and northern Germany.  Time-Life books put out a volume called RAMESES II THE GREAT. It has a good picture of the blond mummy of Rameses II. Another picture can be found in the book X-RAYING THE PHARAOHS, especially the picture on the jacket cover. It shows his yellow hair.  A book called CHRONICLE OF THE PHARAOHS was recently published showing paintings, sculptures and mummies of 189 pharaohs and leading personalities of Ancient Egypt. Of these, 102 appear European,  and the rest are hard to classify. All nine mummies look like our Europeans.   The very first pharaoh, Narmer, also known as Menes, looks very Caucasian  The same can be said for Khufuâs cousin Hemon, who designed the Great Pyramid of Giza, with help from Imhotep. A computer-generated reconstruction of the face of the Sphinx shows a European-looking face. It was once painted sunburned red. The Egyptians often painted upper class men as red and upper class women as white; this is because the men became sun-burned or tanned while outside under the burning Egyptian sun. The women, however, usually stayed inside.  â¦..

Yes, they come from Ancient Egyptian culture, but these gods are NOT Egyptian. The Egyptians worshipped them as they were divine entities not from this realm - these gods are not from any identifiable human ethnicity!  As for the lead ""human"" characters, no, neither are they Egyptian, but then again, think about every movie set in Ancient Rome where they are played by British actors. I am a Hungarian/Romanian who watched the new Netflix Dracula series where Dracula was played by a Danish actor. You think I care? It is a fictional story.
