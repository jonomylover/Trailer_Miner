We found insidious be messing up clicking paranormal activity and watched insidious instead and fell in love. We saw the second one together. Well we were in theaters to see Ouija and this trailer came on. Now we didn't know it was Insidious 3, but when the hand came down we jumped. We heard the beginning of Tip Toe Through The Tulips and looked at each other, both of our minds blown, then we sat there flailing our arms around and trying not to cry out of excitement.

If you plan on watching the movie, I recommend not watching the trailer since it practically shows 80% of the jump scares. The first Insidious terrified me, and this was like a desperate attempt to keep the franchise going. The prequel was COMPLETELY unnecessary, and if you're looking for an interesting  story about the origin of the red man you will be sorely disappointed. There's so many jump scares to the point where it wasn't even scary anymore, and the demons don't have that sense of mystery and fright they once gave you. There's even parts where the psychic FIGHTS them and basically throws around these demons that are supposed to be terrifying and keep you at the edge of your seat.
