2015-03-04T20:31:51,"I'm speculating here, but stay with me. We know Marvel Studios/Disney made a deal with Fox to use Quicksilver in Avengers: AoU, maybe the deal was temporary use. I mean we sort of saw a really young Scarlett Witch in X-men DoFP, but maybe that's the deal. Fox takes Quicksilver, Marvel Studios/Disney takes Scarlett Witch. We don't see Quicksilver in the final battle sequence of this trailer, so it has led me to believe that Quicksilver will probably die in Avengers AoU, in keeping with the contract with Fox who will use the character more in upcoming X-men films (particularly X-men Apocalypse). Meanwhile, Scarlett Witch will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The only real shred of evidence I have of this is the final battle sequence of this trailer. Quicksilver is no where to be seen nor any evidence of his powers at use. Then again, we don't see Vision either, who we know is in this film as well. So it goes something like this, (Potential Spoilers) Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch before they became ""Miracles"" were seen rioting over something. Baron von Strucker offers them powers to help save the world, but it doesn't go so well for the twins. The twins are empowered but possessed by Loki's Scepter (an Infinity stone, I might add) and used to do the work of von Strucker. At this point, Strucker either allows Ultron to take the twins or Ultron simply takes them, regardless Ultron has possession of them. Ultron and the Twins make a robot army (along with Vision at some point) to fight the Avengers. Chaos ensues, and amongst the chaos, Quicksilver is the first to snap out of his possession (maybe because of Vision). Scarlett witch is still a slave, and when Quicksilver sees her do bad things, he attempts to stop her but fails when someone kills Quicksilver (maybe Ultron). Scarlett Witch (much in the same way Hawkeye joins the Avengers in the first film) snaps out of her possession and fights with the Avengers. This is all speculation, so I guess we'll find out May 1st if this is true, but hey one can hope, because I'm still very intrigued!",0,6,NonSamaritan,JAUoeqvedMo,0.04270833333333333,2015-03-04 20:31:51,True,True

And people are still going to devour this by the millions.  The more movies I see coming out of Hollywood recently, the more I think I can do twice a better job at what's being released now. There are some gems here and there, but they're very rare, and really require a good script writer, actual story, and character development, without simplified or nonsensical dialogue, special effects, but an actual story progression with a prologue, conflict introduction, build up, battle, conflict resolve and an ending that makes sense. Of course you don't have to follow the usual formula, there's movies that were successful with a very unique and complex storyline such as Mr.Nobody. Overall I think this has boosted my confidence in what I am writing at the moment, and think it would definitely impress people now that I see the standard at which Hollywood is releasing short handed movies to the common movie enthusiast.",0,4,GrandvisionStudio,JAUoeqvedMo,0.12366567460317461,2015-03-04 22:32:14,True,True

2015-03-04T23:11:17,"LOVE THIS TRAILER   First off, there are a couple things that i noticed watching it a couple times, that i thought i'd point out... maybe some you knew, maybe some you didn't and some things that just might not mean a lot... but be cool anyways. So.... potential spoilers??      1. At the very beginning, we see Ultron giving a bit of back story to the twins. A glance at Ultron sitting on the... throne? shows him wearing what looks like Scarlett Witch's red cloak/shawl, that she can be seen wearing later on in the trailer. Just before this we see a far pan of the entirebuilding, which i speculate to be some kind of Hydra base. Likely, the original and main base where Baron von Strucker operated from? In previous trailers, we'd seen a man working with operating equipment that was likely Baron himself. The throne would be barons, and this makes sense- since the twins were originally kept in Hydra custody, that is where they'd be most likely to appear first. It looks like they walked in on Ultron who was waiting for them... presumably with her cloak to get her attention? I dont know... shits cool though.  2.Very next thing is Ultron removing a sort of cable from the back of his head. now, this could mean absolutely nothing, and probably does... but as most obsessive comic book fans do, i will proceed to over-analyze everything. Could this present some sort of weakness to Ultron? Is it either him somehow upgrading himself, or is it possible he is in need of occaisional recharging? Who knows? But seeing as how Ultron is an incredibly durable villian whos outer shell is supposed to be nearly impenetrable... maybe this could bode well?  3. Cap tries to pull a car off the destroyed road by its bumper and people ultimately fall to their death. Things arent built the way they used to be  4. Tony offers his perspective on reasons to fight. This is definitely a different answer than what i know cap's would be, so we have more perspective as we get closer to Civil War.  5. Bruce and Natasha getting hot and heavy, this could be... interesting.  6. Watching everyone get suited up, right after Cap grabs his helmet... what looks to be a scene with Klaw priming a weapon of his... since we already know Andy Serkis is going to be playing Ulysses Klaw (Or at least its very obvious if you know how the character looks like), this claw-like weapon is definitely belonging to him. You can sort of make out his clothing which looks like what he wore in the other trailer, and the weapon aptly relates to his last name, while trading out the standard sonic cannon for what looks somewhat like pairs of tuning forks? That seems like a pretty cool spin on the weapon to give it more relevance.   7. Tony has Loki's scepter!!! Dont know why, but he thought about it enough to still wear the one arm of the suit incase touching it would hurt him somehow. I imagine it could help in the fight...  8. Cap doesn't have any plans tomorrow night. Dont know why that doesnt surprise me, but he doesnt seem like the clubbing type.  9. Update... Ultron is a taaaall muthafucka  10. Scarlett Witch Controls Scarlett Johansson... and her eyes turn a freaky red. So where we saw in a previous trailer, hulk having a case of pinkeye? Probably the same reason.   11. You can see the spit fly from cap's mouth as he gets rekt by Quickie(yes im calling him that, i dont like typing it all out every time)  which actually made me laugh  12. Taunting doesnt work in Thor's favour.  13. From a birds eye view, when everyone is fighting the drones, we see S.W. also lending a hand... showcasing pretty cool powers and seeming to have switched sides. Quickie cant be found, but im sure he's around somewhere.  14. Hulk still lives by the same motto... ""i'm always angry""  15. Finally, a look at GODDAMN VISION!!!

2015-03-05T04:55:20,"@Marvel Entertainment This is bad ass. I don't know if that was a tease to Wolverine with claws or what , but it was a nice touch. I can wait to see how this catalogues within the rest of the MCU. This being the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back and which leads our favorite billionaire, playboy, philanthropist to become a reprimanding republican for superheroes . . .   I really favor what part Spider-Man will play in this afterwards. Though I am a bit unsure on just dropping him into the mix. Mostly because I don't know how he fits into the story at the moment. And, once he's implemented into the fold, how would his presence be explained?   An origin story is a bit like beating the dead horse, but, it gives purpose. A brief synopsis would do. I just find it hard to accept him because he's just being pasted within the universe with no rhyme or reason.  Unless it will be explained in Captain America : Civil War.   I feel Spidey would've been a nice addition to Netflix's The Defenders; working with Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Iron Fist. That way if it was more to explore, you can let that be the start. Well that just my opinion.   All and all, this was a great trailer,  and I hope to be blown away by this film.  #AvengersAssemble",0,9,Michael Walker,JAUoeqvedMo,0.2090277777777778,2015-03-05 04:55:20,True,True

He is also a man posessed by the red skull who used a Cosmic Cube (Tesseract) to move his consciousness into him. What if Hydra used Loki's spear (the mind gem) to locate the red skulls consciousness and place him within Lukins body?...  What if Ultrons doings is the MCU version of Stamford?  What if the MCU version of Senator Gordon Wright (Lukins/Red skull U.S. political puppet) isn't running for president (as in the Captain America comics), but instead advocating for whatever is going to pass for the Superhero Registration Act?  This would then have its dramatic and tragic culmination in Captain America, Civil War ...",0,0,Henrik Vridstoft,JAUoeqvedMo,0.03778571428571429,2015-03-05 10:50:32,True,True

But you traded greatness to accommodate an overrated British director who hasn't done anything anyone's cared about since Shaun Of The Dead, and whose Ant-Man script was so Avengers-incompatible that he ended up quitting the movie altogether, making Hank and Janet's omission from the Avengers movies a total, unnecessary waste of time.

2015-03-05T18:52:22,"Okay. I have officially had it with Marvel.  The 2012 Avengers film was great, at the time. I haven't watched it in a long time so I don't know how it holds up today. Iron Man 3 was a disappointment, especially coming out right after The Avengers and the fact I liked the first Iron Man film from 2008. Thor: The Dark World was an abortion of a two-hour digital intermediate. Awful pacing plus an awful sound mix. The Winter Soldier was the most ""cold-in-the-brain"" of the MCU, and I liked it better than the previous two. It hardly impressed me, however. Guardians of the Galaxy was a fun time, best MCU since The Avengers, but I realized all the jarring tonal shifts in the film when thinking back to it. Big Hero 6 (non-MCU) was cute, but I felt it was watered-down and reliant on too many cliches.  Judging from this trailer alone, Age of Ultron looks like a bloated mess of artifice. Nothing in the trailer was appealing to me compared to the earlier ""Pinocchio"" teaser. Buildings collapse, citizens fleeing, bad guy says something bad in a deep LFE-shaking voice. The shot at 1:08 sold me on this film being a ""No."" Too much loud, dramatic music, Inception horns, expensive but ugly CGI. I could be wrong, but I have a strong feeling this is going to be a mess, and God-willing, it will be the end of Marvel once the reviews come in.",0,0,RkivUnderground,JAUoeqvedMo,0.05186615186615188,2015-03-05 18:52:22,True,True

2015-03-05T20:09:51,"Someone said here that it's boring that Marvel's making movies about unheard heroes. Okay, first of all, if you're talking about GOTG and Ant Man, and you don't know who they are - you don't have to be a fan of them - then you're not really that much of a comic fan to begin with. But that's what makes Marvel movies great. They can take characters who are unpopular outside of the fan base and make it amazing for the layperson, for the person who isn't obsessed as a lot of us are about the genre, myself included. DC certainly cannot say the same. I don't think they have much confidence in any of their characters beyond Superman and Batman because they seem to be constantly rehashing them (especially Superman).   Another thing is that DC has jumped on the Superhero Team movie thing a little over a decade too late to ever catch up with what Marvel's doing. They've spent precious time on substandard movies like Green Lantern, which could have been amazing had it been done right, while Marvel was building a cohesive universe, writing and planning for years, culminating in some of the best superhero works ever, both in movies and in TV land. DC in the scheme of things has only just begun to get their shit together for standalone movies leading up to the elusive Justice League movie. I like DC, too, They're great where animated series are concerned but not so hot in the movie sector. I do like a few of their movies, too, but DC has a long way to go to touch Marvel with a hundred foot pole where the comic book movie genre is concerned. At least Marvel has faith in their abilities to breathe life into their lesser known characters and make it amazing for fans and laypeople alike. ",0,0,Jason Bodden,JAUoeqvedMo,0.09583333333333335,2015-03-05 20:09:51,True,True

Adam Warlock will not appear until Guardians of the galaxy 2 and Thanos will come back on the set in Avenger 3 Infinity war part I. the Credit scene of this movie will introduce Hank (Ant-man) which will lead us to Ant-Man the Movie, does make perfect sense cause tony and hank both were behind the Ultron Program and Black widow will be forced to join sides with Hydra which will happen in Captain America Civil War with Red skull coming back (Red Skull did not die in Captain America The First Avenger) and Baron Von Strucker will be leading Hydra what im most interested in seeing. I wonder why they don't have another Hulk Movie planned cause their missing the Plot between Hulk and The Leader even Red Hulk also. In Thor: Ragnorok Loki takes over Asgard as seen at the end of Thor: The Dark World and Beta Ray Bill Thor's Psychic will make an appearance during the 3rd movie who else is also making an appearance is Enchantress. going on to Black panther and Captain Marvel Now well in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 Captain Marvel should be a possible character cause hes apart of the Cree Empire and Black panther will be revealed in Ant-man. oh i almost forgot Doctor Strange they mentioned him in Captain America Winter Soldier when those Helicarriers were targeting multiple people",1,0,Admiralsniper Productions,JAUoeqvedMo,0.0391304347826087,2015-03-05 23:14:33,True,True

A battered and broken Ultron slowly crawls out only to be hit by multiple high impact darts which simultaneously electrify and after several moments of excruciating ""pain"" Ultron is down and out. A lone individual walks up to Ultron with hands extending towards him then stops. The slow rumbling resumes this time focusing on Ultron's body. There is shaking all around as the individual's hands slowly move apart from each other and then in one quick movement (then in slow mo) Ultron's body is ripped apart into several pieces. The individual turns and looks up (facing the camera now) ""Target down Sir!"" - Skye/Daisey/Quake.

THOR is the ONLY avengers who knows about infinity stones and what they are capable of thanks to THor: the Dark world. He knows theyre dangerous. Ultron is created with the mind gem and a mind with no soul is dangerous. WHere as vision, if his yellow gem is the soul gem, has a soul. And therfore has more humanly qualities to him. I think the reason quicksilver isnt in the group fight scene is cause 1. They edited him out for the  moment cause they want his full power shown in the movie instead of the trailer to not be compared quickly to Fox's Quicksivler, or 2, he doesnt join his sister thinking shes wrong to side with the avengers. in particular, Stark!

2015-03-06T13:19:37,Here's my theory about the Banner and Black Widow thing.  I think that it's actually Scarlet Witch who's controlling Banner into letting him think he's seeing Black Widow. That scene could be the beginning of the mindcontrol over the Hulk. After that we'll get the Hulkbuster vs. Hulk fight. And after that we'll see Banner sitting all scared in the quinjet. And after that Tony is probably going to suit up in that new suit we've seen in this trailer. So I'm guessing Hulk is going to bust the Hulkbuster and the Iron Man suit that's in it. ﻿,0,0,Hieillua,JAUoeqvedMo,-0.04924242424242424,2015-03-06 13:19:37,True,True

Their relationship is actually more friend I see every once in a while.  In the Avengers Widow did have a connection with Hawkeye, but it wasn't intimate.  Hawkeye saved her life and she wanted to do the same.  Their relationship is more best buds.  In Cap 2 you guys do realize she only kissed Cap to maintain cover right?  Their relationship is more big bro little sis.  Widow doesn't know Bucky well enough in the MCU to have any real relationship with.  So no they haven't teased her being with every Avenger and yeah it is possible for her and Banner to have a intimate relationship.

Tony Stark, Captain America and Thor all will not die because they are set to be in future movies (Cap 3 and Thor 3)  It is possible that Hawkeye or Black Widow die, but we see them in the last fight, maybe they die In the very end  Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are possibilities but then again, we see Scarlet Witch in the last fight, but we don't see Quicksilver... Possibly he is moving so fast, or he isn't present, or he is dead... But the actor for Quicksilver's contract still has more movies to do.  The Hulk might die, but really? The Hulk?  The Vision might die to save the team. But that's a dumb move, introduce a new character and kill him off Immediately? No.  Ultron dying? maybe...  Nick Fury is a possibility, hmmm...  That girl Agent, maybe...  Haters, likely...  And I really don't see other characters guaranteed to be in the movie to die.

2015-03-07T04:09:11,"FILTHY RAGS VS HIS GARMENT   Our garment (our flesh and works that proceed from it) is one of corruption, God's garment (His spirit and works that proceed from him) is one of true righteousness.  Jude 1:23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; HATING EVEN THE GARMENT SPOTTED BY THE FLESH.   Mark 10:49-52 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.  And he, CASTING AWAY HIS GARMENT, rose, and came to Jesus. And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.  Hmmmm our garments seem to be dirty in God's presence, and that is the one you want?  WHAT IS OUR GARMENT?  Isaiah 64:6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all OUR RIGHTEOUSNESSES ARE LIKE FILTHY RAGS; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.  OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS ALREADY DEFILED. YOU NEED HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS NOT YOURS!  Romans 9:30-32 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it NOT BY FAITH, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;  ISRAEL FOLLOWED AFTER RIGHTEOUSNESS, THEIR OWN! THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS!  IMPUTED MEANS GIVEN.    Romans 4:20-25 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. And therefore it was IMPUTED TO HIM FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS. Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; But for US ALSO, to whom IT SHALL BE IMPUTED, IF WE BELIEVE ON HIM that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.  IT IS AS CLEAR AS DAY IF YOU ARE NOT FILLED WITH PRIDE.  YOU NEED GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS NOT YOUR OWN.  IF YOU SEEK AFTER YOUR OWN YOU WILL GO TO HELL AND BURN FOREVER!  HIS GARMENT HEALS.  Luke 8:43-44 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.  HIS GARMENT IS ACCEPTABLE.  Mathew 22:10-13 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests. And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a WEDDING GARMENT: And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  YOU CAN NOT MIX HIS NEW GARMENT WITH YOUR OLD ONE OR IT WILL DESTROY BOTH.  Matthew 9:16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse",0,0,Leopard-King,JAUoeqvedMo,0.03102795193312436,2015-03-07 04:09:11,True,True

2015-03-09T03:03:20,"Ultron = Ultron + Dr Doom + Magneto? To me it seems as if Ultron in the MCU combines trades of three characters: 1. Ultron (obviously), 2. Dr Doom (in the trailer we see Ultron on a throne (wearing a cape?) in a fortress/castle in a fictional eastern european country Sokovia) You just have to change Sokovia to Latveria to get a pretty good version of Doom. Doom has his Doombots, Ultron has his Army of Ultrons. Ultron even has blasts similar to Dr Doom 3. Magneto (In the comics Scarlet Whitch and Quicksilver were part of the brotherhood of evil mutans lead by magneto, after a few issues they changed teams and became part of the Avengers. Thats exactly what seems to happen in the movie. But in this case its Ultron, not Magneto manipulating them  To me it seems that because Marvel doesn't own the rights to Fantastic Four And The X Men, they try to integrate some trades into characters they own. In the trailer you see Hawkeyes new arrows that look A LOT like Wolverines claws. I think its quite possible that Hawkeys will take the role that Wolverine has in the comics. He is a grumpy killer who seems to be a bit of a loner.  Please tell me what you think about my theory, guys",1,1,Philipp Tanzer,JAUoeqvedMo,0.12402597402597403,2015-03-09 03:03:20,True,True

2015-03-09T03:11:46,"Now this is just a theory: Ultron was a dormant peacekeeping program. suggesting he was created X amount of years ago (but without sentience) by someone but never used to an extent. Ultron says that he was designed to save the world. Now that could've been his main function when he was designed years ago. His main function in this film is to protect the world so that the Avengers don't have to. That is Starks plan for Ultron. So Stark finds the old program and figures hey this will work. So the question is: who made the program all those years ago. So the big part of this theory is that Hank is the first person to design Ultron. Now im 100% cool if they want to leave it ambiguous and its all Tony's doing but this is for the ones bitching about it not being Pym's creation and want that bit of hope. So a while back there was the first official clip of Antman at SDCC. In the clip Hank comment that superheroes are a ""goddamn joke"". This obviously indicates he has no respect or love for heroes in the present. So his idea back then was to create something that ultimately protects the world without the use of heroes. He probably saw himself becoming one in the future and didn’t want that <still working on that part. He wanted Ultron to protect the world but something got in the way. Be it personal/moral issues or the government that stopped him. Howard ‘stark is in Antman so maybe there’s more of a connection. Maybe Howard stole or just vaulted it and thats how Tony gets it. So the program is halted and awaiting to be rebooted in the future by Tony where he makes the mistake of giving it free rein on the worlds info and takes its programing tooooo seriously. So theres my “Hank is still the creator of Ultron” theory. Now Ant man is only 3 months after AoU so I see there being references here in there for a movie that should still be fresh in minds. ",0,0,Vexen4,JAUoeqvedMo,0.11739130434782606,2015-03-09 03:11:46,True,True

2015-03-09T11:59:52,"LIKE THIS COMMENT SO PEOPLE SEE IT AND FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHATS GOING ON! (Not fishing for likes, just trying to help people).  Can't believe there's still people who think the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) is part of the Xmen films. MCU is Disney, Xmen is Fox. I don't understand how people could possibly think they're part of the same world. You wouldn't watch Harry Potter and then say it's part of Lord of the Rings. Just because they're the same genre doesn't make them part of the same universe lol. Until now, the Amazing Spider-Man was stand alone by Sony but now they're revamping him and introducing him into the Avengers world. Don't tell me you thought the Amazing Spider-Man was part of the same story too?   It doesn't take a genius to realise that they're not intertwining with each other. If people actually realised this and watched the films in order then the world would be a less stressful place.   AVENGERS films- Ironman The Incredible Hulk Ironman 2 Thor Captain America: the First Avenger The Avengers Ironman 3 Thor: the Dark World Captain America: the Winter Soldier  Guardians of the Galaxy Avengers: Age of Ultron Ant-Man Captain America: Civil War Doctor Strange Guardians of the Galaxy 2 Spider-Man revamp  Thor: Ragnarok Avengers: Infinity War part 1 Black Panther Captain Marvel Avengers: Infinity War part 2 Inhumans  X-MEN films- X-Men X-2 X-Men 3: the Last Stand X-Men Origins: Wolverine X-Men: First Class The Wolverine  X-Men: Days of Future Past X-Men: Apocalypse Wolverine 3 X-Force   As for the Amazing Spider-Man films, eradicate them from your memory, they're over. The new version of the character is set to star in Captain America: Civil War. Okay is everyone clear now? X-Men and the Avengers films are DIFFERENT! If you took the time to watch ALL the films rather than watching the odd one that appeals to you things may make a little more sense. They're like big comic books, you wouldn't read at random parts, it requires you to read from beginning to end. Also, for those who think that was somehow Wolverine in the trailer now know that it wasn't! (It was Hawkeye loading his quickfire arrows).

Maybe Iron Man is talking about the time that he made a terrible mistake (Ultron) and we see Ultron destroy the Avengers (maybe one of them dies in the process, who knows?). Later on we could then see the Avengers come back for one last round. It would cause so much devastation that they start disagreeing with each other (then the events of Civil War would happen).

Stark didn't know mind stone is in fact controlled by some other being and it turned Ultron into an evil robot to help them wipe earth, which they failed in The Avengers.   Quicksilver and Scarletwitch (mind washed) first joins Ultron to help him, but at the end they broke out of the brainwash and joins Avengers.   Stark invites the crew to Stark tower for that party, but Ultron broke in and started wrecking the place up. After they defeated Ultron bots, the remaining Ultron escaped and created a more powerful version of Ultron. The crew starts hunting down Ultron until they finally meet and thus that big ending fight scene. ",0,0,Insert name HERE,JAUoeqvedMo,-0.10235042735042735,2015-03-09 21:39:51,True,True

2015-03-10T02:57:22,"SaLuSa March 6, 2015   I bring you greetings from the Galactic Forces who follow your progress with great interest, since you have taken through many lives. However, our commitment to you has never been more intense than it is now, as we approach the end of your experiences in the old paradigm. We have come a long way together, and we admire your determination to respect your tasks and achieve victory over the dark ones. The fact that they have actually already won that battle does not mean you have more work to do, and the emphasis is now to maintain your position in the higher vibrations. They are your future and also protection, while keeping focused on the current role assisting the Light. We talked earlier about his ability to stay within their own light, and not be influenced by anything going on around you. Now that you have come to this point, you have created an aura that is potentially impregnable, but it is up to you to be able to keep it intact. It means not to be distracted or misled by any attempt to divert attention elsewhere. Stay calm in situations that are a test of your strength, is the challenge you face. Remember that you have come through the trials and tribulations that the 3rd. size is thrown at you. You have won the battle but you still have to lift yourself up to higher dimensions. The Dark will make their last attempts to distract, but with little effort you should overcome them. By now your awakening you should have permission to look beyond the programming that has bound, to see the deception that has been placed upon you. We tell you once again that it is far more than you imagine, or have been led to believe. You are really great Beings of Light that you will be back when you join with your Higher Self. Then say to yourself that you have the full potential to be great once more, and nothing is beyond your ability. For too long you have worked under the impression that you are Beings humble and have suffered as a result. Now you are beginning to understand the reason for which they were held back by the actions of darkness, but now their power has been reduced and is regaining your. While spreading the light as always keep a watchful eye on you, and will not allow any interference with the progress that will affect the outcome. We can do a lot to prevent any attempt to delay or interfere with your work, and often are not aware of such attempts. Keep in mind that the end times are such that a lot of karma or unfinished work is done. Often stays up to this time period, like when you have raised your vibrations, the ability to address the outstanding issues is that much higher. Do not belittle yourself you have immense potential and projecting such conviction you empower yourself. The Law of Attraction is powerful and a true reality, but it works in ways that can not be realized. You have to be positive at all times, as a negative attitude will attract more of the same. Making the claim that you can do something, rather than ask for help to do that, you will advance much faster. The results may not always happen quickly as you would like, but it will come in time. God does not play with you, but there are other beings who, for different reasons you masquerade as God and try to lead you in a different direction. Your intuitive powers should make you suspicious of such institutions, in particular if you are attracted to interesting proposals. However, if you have come to terms with one's ego should recognize attempts to mislead you. Until it was returned to the light you encounter different obstacles on your way at different times. Be careful and know that God and the higher beings do not play with you, and they all love and know them by their light. It may have been cut off from us, but now that the veils that hid the truth have been removed, will gradually regain full understanding. Be prepared to learn more truth about yourself and be ready to take your place among us. Some souls are not yet ready to know the truth of your existence or even your past history, but that is not going to hold back their progress. They will be guided on a path that will take them back and lessons will be learned regardless of how long it takes. This is why we ask you to see the Light in all souls and not affect them, as you do not know what challenges they have undertaken. Coming out of darkness into light is a powerful experience and souls doing so need compassion and help to succeed. You have not been told by the great Master Jesus, to be careful that you entertain because you do not know when you are in the company of an angelic being. If you treat all people with respect and kindness you will do the best we can for them and yourself. In fact, life is not complicated, but in your current size is a constant battle with low vibration. At every turn there is the potential challenge that can catch you off guard, but if you are strong in your beliefs can not cause any harm. There is only one great power that is unchangeable and above all things, and that is love, and everything you need to navigate through your experiences. Love every soul and if their behavior is such that you find repulsive you clearly do not have to strike up a friendship with them. You have a way of saying ""that if you can not say anything good about someone do not say anything bad"", and this is a good way of life. How will attract like, you have definitely found and you should already have a circle of friends that are in harmony with. We of the Galactic fleets ready to arrive on Earth in a short time of being given the command. So, be sure that there will be no delay on our part once the situation is such that we can safely visit. You must understand that we do not want to interfere directly with the progress, but will follow the orders you give us for improvement. Rest assured that we are here for you and we look forward to meeting you in peaceful circumstances. I am SaLuSa from Sirius, and represent the forces of Light that take care of you. I send love and wishes for a good end for your stay. Thank you SaLuSa.   07-14 March 2015  Amati,  The passage of time speeds up, or rather, has that influence on your life. There are many times in the history of the Earth that are coming into alignment with the current timeline and the information and knowledge that is lost in the mists of antiquity is now presented in a revised and updated. There is a process of integration that is occurring and also recalibrated to the new reality of all the Earth and everything on the planet. It 'a difficult time for many people around the world and the current energies and increasing port them the need to re-evaluate and reset their priorities, their goals and objectives. This activity will continue to unfold over the next few years, as everyone moves forward based on its level of growth and expansion. During this process accelerated growth for each individual, there will be many stops and starts along the way. It behooves everyone to know themselves and their personal and planetary cycle and then begin to work in unison with them.  Everyone is now firmly following their star, their individual path and higher destiny. It 'important to be patient with one another, as this process continues, because there is no room for all of humanity in their diversity to expand fully in wonderful and amazing ways. What seems wrong for an individual is exactly the right thing for another. Every person has to learn to listen, empathize, and sensitive to, their inner promptings. This can create a clash of wills at times and care must be taken to allow everyone in their vicinity and sphere of influence of the individual right to move at their speed they process the metamorphosis that is taking place within them. The internal changes that are taking place affect everyone and it is important to remember this when interacting with each other. Realize that everyone is doing the best they can at all times and can only assimilate to their level of understanding. Let go of all ideas and expectations fixed or rigid and surrender to the natural flow of events. Be easy on yourself and others and detachment practice in all situations.  Those of you who have already gone through most of the cleaning, clearing and elimination process are working to perfect your system to five body. You have been learning to see the beauty of every moment in your personal world and the people in it. Like love, respect and appreciation for each other and for your world expands and grows, letting go of old perceived limitations in all areas of your life and replacing them with the determination to come through these opportunities stimulants in unity and peace will be the first motivation within the heart of every person. There is a greater union of the people of the Earth that is occurring. Every person on Earth is important in the divine scheme of things and help each other with an open heart, humility, honesty, kindness and generosity is the way to create the change you want to bring into this world.  One now understands that love, compassion and kindness are the motivating power behind every word and action, behind every thought and feeling that you hold in your heart in order to create a life more peaceful, prosperous and abundant. By being aware of the choices you make and how these choices can influence others around you, always seek only their highest good and greatest in everything you do. As each of you tend to your garden of life, the highest potential takes root and grows in the reality of each person and feeds with their care, patience and diligence. There is tremendous power in a strong intention that is fueled by love. When practicing the blessing of the world, the world blesses you ten times in return.  Cultivating the practice of focusing on the things in your life that bring joy and maneuvers around distractions that come your way, you can be assured that your focus and determination will begin to manifest this in your life so wonderfully synchronistic. Believe in yourself, dear, that you have the power and the ability to create the life of your dreams. Persevere in your efforts to make certain positive change in your life, the lives of your loved ones, and your world. You deserve to have everything your heart desires fully manifest here on Earth.

Plus at the end of the ""Avengers: infinity war"" trailer we could see Thanos with the gauntlet and all the infinity gems in it. The Tesseract is an infinity gem and we could also see another gem in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", so Marvel, I have a question for you: Since Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers have all these things in common (infinity gems, Thanos and stuff that happens in the comics) are we going to see a crossover between Guardians an Avengers? Is the 3rd part of The Avengers going to be the same as the 3rd part of Guardians of the Galaxy?

I also liked how they used shots to resemble scenes from the comics now I'm not really a big comic reader but I do know my fair bit and I know the  Second shot of ultron sat in his throne with a hood over him is a reference crimson cowl who was ultron in disguise I think who also assembled the masters of evil so maybe we might see a glimpse or something of them.   I liked how they are also setting up for Captain America civil war as well plus I liked how we got a bit of comedy in this trailer but it was still dark in its own way.  I do think marvel are doing great with not spoiling things in there trailers like sony did with the Amazing Spiderman 2 now I have to be honest I loved the amazing spider man 2 it did have it's pros and cons like most films do. Also some people are a bit stunned about the romance between hulk and black widow and that it should of been between her and hawkeye or steve rogers. Now 1. Hawkeye and widow were close friends and I think hawkeye saved her so the only chemistry really between them is good friendship. 2. In the winter soldier widow had to kiss steve Rogers so they couldn't get caught by hydra plus she was trying to set him up with a girl, so I do like what Joss Weedon has done here.  Lastly if you pause at 1 minute and 48 seconds when ultron is in the sky and you see his army of drones if you look closely on the left hand corner there appears to be someone standing on some rubble dressed in black and I think someone is standing next to it, now it could be a statue but I would like to know what other people think it could be that's if you spot it.

And I have such point of view on this movie-catastrophe not simply because of its popularity and current rentability. That's because this piece of vomit does not deserve anything from what was attributed to it. Poorly scripted and realized plot, which gives no investigation to the actual story. Poorly made and represented characters. Captain America is the most uninteresting and uninspiring character in a whole film, even considering the fact that he is supposed to be a leader and the core of the group, but it does not say much since every character in that film was blend and uninspiring. Overuse and formulaic humor, that most of the time feels out of the place. Caricaturistic, not interesting villain, that only able to threat your sister's wet pants. List goes on and on. And there is no excuse for this bullcrap, such as ''That movie was meant to be fun'', ''It's not supposed to be taken seriously''. Well, I'm taking seriously the fact that most people overacting and overpraising dull and uninspiring shit product that this movie was. What, you want to talk about the differences between everybody's taste and opinion and that you have to respect them? Well, most of those bandwagon passengers, who like to make such banal argument, forget about it completely when they take shit at someone like twilight fans, while I find it hilarious, because I don't see a big difference between both. This doesn't give any hope for its to at least be different, interesting and creative. The only difference is, the trailer tries make this movie look like the emo version of the same bullcrap that has been done by these hacks three years ago.

And I have such point of view on this movie catastrophe not simply because of its popularity and current rentability. That's because this piece of vomit does not deserve anything from what was attributed to it. Poorly scripted and realized plot, which gives no investigation to the actual story. Poorly made and represented characters. Captain America is the most uninteresting and uninspiring character in a whole film, even considering the fact, that he is supposed to be a leader and the core of the group, but it does not say much since every character in that film was blend and uninspiring. Overuse and formulaic blend humor, that most of the times feels out of the place. Caricaturistic, not interesting villain, that only able to treat your sisters wet pants. List goes on and on. And there is no excuse for this bullcrap, such as ''That movie was meant to be fun'', ''It's not supposed to be taken seriously''. Well, I'm taking seriously the fact, that most people overacting and overpraising dull and uninspiring shit product that that movie was. What, you want to talk about the differences between everybody's taste and opinion, and that you have to respect them? Well, most of those bandwagon passengers who likes to make such banal argument, forget about it completely, when they take shit at someone like twilight fans, while, I find it hilarious, because, I don't see a big difference between both. This doesn't give any hope for it to at least be different, interesting and creative. The only difference is, the trailer try make this movie look like the emo version of the same bullcrap that has been done by these hacks three years ago.

In fact, everyone of them is invincible, including Nick Fury, except Capt America, he is the only guy I can sense has a vulnerability.   So let me guess, the only reason this robot is a threat, is because he has a lot of other minion robots, who apparently is a challenge for the op Avengers, along with having that Scarlet girl mind control peeps similar to Loki's stick.

I know it's a trend marvel have started lately, with Captain America 2 and mostly Guardians of the galaxy, with their strong desire to bring in as many characters from the marvel universe as possible.. but I don't agree that that is the best course to take to be honest.. It leaves smoother, cleaner and more polished movies if they take it at a slower pace in my opinion. But then again, marvel have presented some pretty impressive movies in the past, and if there's a reason any of marvels latest movies have felt a bit rushed, un-polished or ""meh"", it's because they've worked on THIS movie..

The Avengers in real life are us. We the people of earth have to stop Ultron, before it kills us all, in the name of peace. The way to do this peacefully is to take away Ultron's power.

2015-04-16T21:06:41,"I have the perfect idea for an end credit scene for this movie, okay so as we've seen from a clip already Bruce Banner is feeling tremendous guilt for the lives lost over the hulks rage.  There's been rumors swirling of hulk being sent into space by the avengers because he's too uncontrollable. However I think banner himself blasts him self off in a rocket as a self-sacrifice and this leads me to my 2 alternate endings.   Okay so my first would be we his capsule flying through space and then it cuts to starlets with his feet up in The Milano listening to his 2nd mixtape when the capsule skims past the ship barely missing it and a surprised quill looks out the window and goes like ""what the hell?!"" And we see a kind of mini kid like groot peeping out the window barely the height of the window and says ""I am groot!"" This could then lead onto hulk joining the guardians in their sequel.  My 2nd idea is something if not to happen in this film then the guardians sequel if my first idea happened. So hulk crashes on some asteroid and a dazed hulk stumbles out of the capsule and we see an intimidating shadow leaning over him who is none other than thanos who looks just as physical as the hulk side by side. In his hand he should have the soul gem or perhaps Bruce could have took the soul gem with him and thanos is here to intercept it. He takes the gem and smiles and the scene cuts.  Now saying as loads of people want a world war hulk movie this is  the perfect way to do it.

He's beyond perfect for a role like this, his voice just sounds naturally evil, but he's usually the bad guy you end up rooting for, Ultron isn't quite so easy to understand. He doesn't do it because of some horrible past like say Magneto, he just thinks humans should be eradicated, but for him to be really successful as a bad guy I hope they find a way to make him relatable, because the best villains are the ones you don't want to die.",0,0,Jesse Lacey,JAUoeqvedMo,0.056388888888888905,2015-04-17 00:54:47,True,True

Nice to see Falcon and War Machine actually be Avengers. Ultron not as scary/intimidating as advertised. Vision is basically Jarvis with an infinity gem. I have issues with vision being able to lift Mjolnir. With civil war coming and not really a large roster of characters at there disposal currently could they really afford to kill Pietro?

There was a lot of Black Widow/Hulk romance stuff which came out of nowhere a little but it worked pretty well. Hawkeye has a wife and kids which he was keeping secret. Ultron is an alright villain but was lacking in character beyond generic Whedon quipping. At the end Cap assembles a bunch of new members for the Avengers including Scarlet Witch, Falcon, War Machine and one more if I'm remembering correctly. Quicksilver dies saving Hawkeye. It ends setting up Thor seeking Ragnorok and Cap doubting Stark's ability to resist tampering futher with the world, and Hulk goes AWOL on his own.

2015-04-27T13:04:31,"MAJOR SPOILER ALERT! - The Stone of Mind was previously concealed on Loki's Sceptre, given to the adopted Asgardian by The Other. Given the Other's boss is Thanos, presumably it was the only Stone held by the Titan. It allowed Loki to hypnotize everyone touched by the sceptre, although it only works in contact with skin; once Loki attempt to mind control Iron Man but hit the Arc Reactor on his chest, the magic was unsuccessful. Given its energy signature is similar to the Tesseract's, the Sceptre was neccessary to bypass a failsafe built by Erik Selvig on the Tesseract-harnessing machine that created a wormhole above New York.[9] After Loki was defeated, Hydra took the sceptre from Stark Tower (presumably through undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who helped Tony Stark clean the place) and researched on it. On Baron Strucker's hidden facility at Sokovia, various test subjects were exposed to the Sceptre, with only a set of twins surviving and consequently developing superpowers: Pietro Maximoff, who became a speedster, and Wanda Maximoff, who developed telekinesis and mental manipulation.[11] Once Tony Stark discovered the roundabouts of the Sceptre, the Avengers reassembled to recover it in Sokovia. During the three days prior to Thor's return to Asgard, Tony discovered the stone held information inside it akin to computer language. Tony decided that the data was just what he needed to develop an artificial intelligence that would evolve on J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron. With the help of Bruce Banner and J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron managed to be put into operation, but suddenly decided he would not try save humankind as planned, and begun a plan to exterminate humans. Using one Iron Legion robot to stow away the Sceptre, Ultron took over the former Hydra base and remained the research on the Sceptre. Ultron ultimately decided to create an artificial lifeform that would be better than humans, using vibranium taken from Ulysses Klaue, Helen Cho's biotechnology cradle, and the Infinity Stone which Ultron broke out of the sceptre. While Ultron assembled the creature, Thor discovered in a vision that the gem was an Infinity Stone. While attempting to destroy the android which the Avengers had hijacked and brought to Stark Tower, Thor wound up awakening Vision, who upon emergency turned out to be not as ill-intentioned as Ultron. After Ultron was defeated, Thor had no problem with leaving Vision with the Stone inside him, considering it in good hands. However, Thor was certain another of the stones had appeared because an upper force was using its powers to discover the gems' wereabouts. This turned out to be Thanos, who got the Infinity Gauntlet from the Asgardian armory and decided to continue the Stone-recovering mission by himself.[12]  ",0,0,Kenjong Mendez,JAUoeqvedMo,-0.033996634875541124,2015-04-27 13:04:31,False,True

QuickSilver has a different actor and story as the X-Men version. I anticipate/want some explanation, like he was caught in some sort of warp, or that he was a clone sent into the past.

These two films combined will be about 5 hours long, so a lot presumably has to happen within that time frame. The origin of Thanos. So how does Thanos end up on earth? Will Kang the Conqueror make an appearance in the Infinity movies using the Time stone to move into our dimension? Will Thanos recruit other villains to keep the Hulk occupied while he conquers the world. Villains like maybe the BLOOD BROTHERS? Or maybe he helps ABOMINATION escape from confinement to handle the Hulk while he deals with the rest of the Avengers team. Just speculating of course , but I think these two films will definitely have more than one villain. 2018 can't come soon enough.

У греков была «Илиада», у французов — «Песнь о Роланде», у русских — «Былины», у китайцев — «Императорский Небесный Дворец», а у американцев — комиксы фирмы Marvel про команду супергероев по главе с «Капитаном «Америка», воплощающим в себе идеальные американские ценности. Фирменный конек Marvel — политизированные истории, отражавшие реалии Второй мировой, затем холодной войны и внутриполитические конфликты в США. Политический анализ, основанный на комиксах, сработает надежнее, чем попытки анализировать речи Обамы или Джен Псаки. Поэтому если вы хотите узнать, что загружено в мозги простых американцев, то читайте комиксы Marvel и следите за фильмами по ним.  Американцы создали действительно сильный национальный миф, в котором глобальное господство США обосновывается тем, что американские супергерои защищают мир от чудовищных глобальных угроз. Уязвимое место у этой конструкции только одно: в реальном мире для человечества нет ни одной более значимой глобальной угрозы, чем США. Нет ни одного аватара зла, которое, как Альтрон или ИГИЛ, не было бы делом рук самих же США.  В этих фильмах, люди других народов и культур должны осознать, что, бунтуя против американского порядка, они становятся на сторону еще большего Зла, но созданного самими же американцами. А потому таким людям следует присоединиться к американцам, принести себя в жертву, забыв свою историю, культуру и самоидентичность, а затем следовать по пути «черной вдовы» Наташи Романов («я — бывшая русская»): платить, каяться и оплакивать своё ужасное прошлое.

2015-10-20T18:08:32,"So many things went wrong with this movie. They should've grown a pair of balls this time and stuck to the dark tone that the trailers implied. In order to make Ultron feel menacing they also needed to make sure that he kills at least one character from the previous movies or maybe he manages to kill off a group of civilians. Anything to make it feel like he was actually more powerful to the Avengers. As it stands Iron Man alone kicked his ass without so much as breaking a sweat. The action scenes were also a huge letdown. Aside from Hulk vs Hulkbuster which was really cool the rest just lacked the memorable moments that the first movie did like Iron Man flying towards the wormhole blowing shit up, Hulk smashing Loki around, Hawkeye firing that arrow at Loki that blew up in his face or Captain America convincing the police officer to help him. Absolutely none of that in this movie they just throw punches and jump around a lot and the pacing was too sporadic. Actions scenes start every 15 minutes and then they end within another 5. The climax in particular was just a boring retread of the climax from the first movie but lacking the excitement that made that awesome. Didn't hate the movie because I still enjoy the characters and their chemistry but it was seriously disappointing and I think it might be a good thing that the Russo brothers are handling the next movies for now so we might actually get a darker movie where the Avengers get their asses kicked.

2016-02-06T17:52:02,"5 reasons why Avengers Age of Ultron is the best Superhero movie   5.The Music: The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. I could listen to it for 10 hours and never get tired. It's basically the first movie's theme with a pinch of excitement. Danny Elfman is of course one of my all time favorite music composers.  4. The Set Ups for future films: People are complaining that this is the problem Iron Man 2 had. It's nothing like that. The set ups are done very well. The set up for Thor Ragnarok was my favorite becuse it made me curious about what we're gonna get in that film. It didn't focus TOO much on the set ups like Iron Man 2 did though which is good.  3.The Humor: This the most common complant I'm hearing from people. There saying ""But the trailers set up for a dark movie! Where did all this comedy come from?"" Guys, it's an Avengers movie! It has to be fun! It has to be a film you can have a good time with. It's not a dark, boring DC movie. I laughed quite alot during this film. It was able to balance the humor with the drama perfectly too.  2. The Action: This movie had insane crazy action! The fight scene between Hulk and Iron Man was incredible! And that fight between Captain America and Ultron on the tuck was amazing. Also that final battle on the floating land was mind blowing. I had tears of joy leaking out of my eyes during it. The slow motion, the effects. Oh my god! Brilliant!  1. The Characters: The main reason I adore this movie is becuase of the characters. We got more back story for Hawkeye and Black Widow. And the Vision was handled in the best way possible. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were setting up for Civil War very perfectly. And that scene were Scarlet Witch walked through the door in slo mo was epic. I was shocked when Quicksilver died. He wasn't a great character but he was still a decent incarnation. And Ultron: Everybody has ranted for no reason that Uktron was a weak villian and not threatning at all. Look, Ultron had the scense of humor so the audience can relate to him and make him more likable. Plus he had lots of serious moments out there.

2017-04-02T04:14:56,damn you mcu fans will say anything that marvel does is epic! this movie was a huge letdown. they made it seem so menacing from the trailers but turned out to be another quip fest. the banner and b.widow story line was cheesy. the ending could have been way better. the best part in age of ultron was the hulkbuster scene and when ultron first came on scene other than that it was a snooze fest. I like marvel but this movie sucked....ASS. I was sooo hype when this came out only to feel like I just left 2fast furious. Hell the first avengers wasn't even that great in my opinion it was just the spectacle of them all being on screen is what made people wanna say it was great. iron man 1 was a great introduction to the mcu but they were lacking until winter soldier came along. gotg is entertaining but overrated. any man was good. civil war was also good despite the flaws. and the underdog film for me was the incredible hulk( I thought it was bad ass). so before you all suck and swallow marvels load just break down the movies for what they are as oppose to how you wanted then to be,0,0,Boiwonder84,JAUoeqvedMo,0.26222222222222225,2017-04-02 04:14:56,False,False

The trailers made it seem dark which would’ve been appropriate for a villain like Ultron but they didn’t pull through with that.  There’s a few issues that I have, especially with Ultron the character and Quicksilver dying—I feel it would’ve been better if one of the heroes had an underling, and they died (like if Harley—I know y’all hate Harley, but this is an example—was older and was doing superhero sidekick work and died, that would’ve made things way more dramatic than a cool character we barely got to spend time with).  Even if a main character died and was brought back to life, I’d be fine with that cause that’s more emotionally impactful.  Like during Civil War, i was hoping that Captain America would die because that would absolutely destroy Tony.
