2018-01-25T21:15:41,"I can't wait to see this BUT I'm so sad!! Meryl Streep is my favorite person ever, basically. I discovered her when I saw the original Mamma Mia. My grandma actually took me to a production of Mamma Mia when I was little and I fell in love with the story. I was pretty young when the movie came out, but I knew I HAD to see if because I loved the live version so much. I fell in love with the movie. It has been my favorite movie ever since. I remember in 5th grade if I was bored, I'd ""play"" the movie in my head. I legitimately knew every single word. This being said, I'm a little sad this movie won't be as good as I hoped it'd be when I originally heard it was being made. I was beyond excited because it comes out July 20th, which is 3 days after my 20th birthday (yes I was born July 17th, or as Donna would say ""July 17th, WHAT a night""). Where's Meryl??? Why is her mom alive?? We know from the first movie she's dead... I hope they at least address this, like maybe Donna just thought she was dead bc of the lack of communication?

2018-01-25T21:30:56,"I think Meryl is going to be part of the movie, but we'll probably see her in flashbacks. The whole story is about her daughter trying to figure out how to go about being pregnant and what that entails when it comes to her future. In the last teaser, one of Donna's friends tells Sophie that her mom did it all by herself and she sat down next to her as if she were to tell her a story. If Donna was there, then it'd be Donna and her friends telling Sophie all about how she was able to persevere back then when she was pregnant with Sophie. So the way the teaser is edited, one might think she isn't there for the pregnancy. Be it because she's far away or dead. Who knows. But it's more than obvious that many things in the teaser would be different if Donna was physically there. Also, the phrase ""I've feel closer to ____ than ever before"" is usually said when someone has passed away or for someone who isn't near by. Like for example when people find out about something about a family member. So yeah, they may be leading us on to believe she's gone. Or she may be infact gone. Who knows.

Did the writers just forget that or is there a twist? Also, I'm sure Lily and the guys are great but why didn't they have the actors' kids play the younger versions?

2018-07-20T21:59:24,"There is such an unbelievably sad pall throughout the majority of this film (Meryl Streep not being there).  The entire time, it continuously distracts you, wondering why Meryl pulled out of it (was there a fight between people? money fight? etc.) but then almost near the end (Thank God), Meryl finally shows up (in a short cameo) and an incredibly tender moment happens which literally makes you cry.  But still afterward, you‚Äôd been thinking for so long that Meryl Streep had been kicked off (or backed out of) the project that you‚Äôd already accepted her as being a  no-show, so it kind of felt ‚Äòtoo little too late‚Äô.  The writer abandoned the audience by killing Meryl‚Äôs character off from the very beginning, so you felt deeply upset with the writer for killing her off and making the audience feel depressed for over an hour when you thought it was going to be a fun movie from the start like the first one was.    Amanda Siefried has an exquisitely beautiful voice. Lily James is a stand-out actress.  Colin Firth is hilarious on the boat.  Cher is  amazing as always and her role had great depth.  It‚Äôs always great to see Pierce Brosnan.  Gorgeous Greek island set/color design especially in Amanda‚Äôs bedroom.  The actress who helped deliver Lily James‚Äô baby is an amazing actress.  This film should have been way more lighthearted and fun starting from the beginning, instead of starting it with bumming the audience out for over an hour and Lily James seeming to have incredibly superficial values at the very beginning. They should have worked on Lily‚Äôs backstory story using tons more thought and depth.  Her dialogue was absolutely not believable as a Valedictorian at the beginning. The Abba songs will always be timeless though.  They should reshoot it featuring Meryl at the beginning continually yelling at Lily James ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it!‚Äù at her younger self.",2,3,Therese Ember,pM4Ou4T3s_I,0.25,2018-07-20 21:59:24,False,True

2018-08-27T02:56:37,"It‚Äôs in the wake of another poisoned story (the second of this year) that has made my fears for HTTYD 3 grow. I lack any confidence (however I will happily eat these words if I‚Äôm wrong) that a man determined to make his fans cry with the final DRAGON film won‚Äôt succumb to the tragically unfortunate ‚Äòdestroy good stories‚Äô craze we seem to have in our film world lately. I hate stories that set up this great, epic story and then tear it down in a sequel (or connecting story) I love the stories that inspire life, hope, courage and above all love. A love of the story, a love of life. Really is needed, agreed, in stories to be believable, but like sugar in a repicy it needs balance. Too much makes it too sweet to little makes it sour. MAMMA MIA 2 was a nice story, good to see the back story, but I found it tried to recreate this epic cake and failed. The music wasn‚Äôt as vibrant or inspiriting, it lacked it‚Äôs basic and homely quality I loved best about the first and - while I can appreciate a tale about mourning and moving on - I felt this one was too focused on the sad. Leaving many questions unanswered as well. It was too forced and ridged and regretfully I must say; soulless. It had too much sugar for my tastes and sadly falls to the second film this year in a series that negates the great, epic story that came before. I can only hope this growing horrible occurrence in our films burns out before DRAGONS 3 arrives next year, because; though I‚Äôll be open and fair, I WILL NOT hold any punches in my review of DRAGONS 3 if such a soulless, dark and depression craze remains in the last film of the very dearly loved series. I‚Äôve seen the death of two beloved franchises. For the love of Thor! Don‚Äôt give us another one. Stories of dark and sad can work but not if it butchers something that was once vibrant, strong and wonderful. That‚Äôs too much reality, too much sugar for anyone to swallow.  Making it DRAGON size‚Ä¶well, it will choke this writer half to death.  I can only hope it won‚Äôt end that way.¬†Mamma Mia 2 Review By Ej Robinson",0,0,Eliana Robinson,pM4Ou4T3s_I,0.15051523297491037,2018-08-27 02:56:37,False,True
