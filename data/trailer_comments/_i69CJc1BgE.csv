This is a Mexican version of Nightmare before christmas. Which is another Garbage Movie, of satanic indoctrination. God sent his son Jesus Christ into the world not to condemn the world, but that the world by him (Jesus Christ) May be SAVED! Please WAKE UP to what is going on in the world, and the War that is being played on your subconscious mind, and your Soul. Time running out, we are nearing the end of days. Believe in The Lord Jesus Christ, know that he died for OUR sins, and payed them in Full on the Cross! He conquered Death, and The Grave 3 days later, and is Alive Forever more!
