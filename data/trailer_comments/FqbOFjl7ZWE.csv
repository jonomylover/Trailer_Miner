So, he wanted to change the history and his past life. So he sends a terminator to train Sarah Connor and be ready when the first terminator gets sent back to kill her.

2014-12-04T21:06:03,"For those confused about these movies, I got the time line worked out. Sorta:    In ""Terminator 1"": John Connor and Kyle Reese lead the Resistance. John hears word of a T-800 (Bad Arnie) going back in time to kill his mother to stop him from being born. Kyle offers to go back in time to protect her. Kyle ends up falling in love with John's mom and they do the do. And alas, John Connor is born. Kyle is John's father, but is KIA at the end of the film.  In ""Terminator 2 Judgement Day"": John, still in the future, reprograms a captured T-800 (Good Arnie) and sends it back in time to protect his younger self and mom, Sarah, from being killed by a T-1000 (Shape-shifting Terminator), as Judgement Day is on the horizon.  In ""Terminator 3"": Judgement Day has been delayed after the events in ""T2"". John's mother Sarah, has died from cancer.  A T-X ( enhanced female Terminator) is sent back in time to kill John's wife, Kate Brewster. A would-be lieutenant in the Resistance with her husband John. However, Kate Brewster in the future, sends another T-800 (Good Arnie Again) back in time to protect her younger self and her soon-to-be husband, John Connor from the T-X. T-800 (Arnie) sacrifices itself to destroy the T-X and save John and Kate. John and Kate take shelter in a nuclear shelter as Judgement Day begins and John finally accepts himself as the leader of the Resistance.  In ""Terminator: Salvation"":  Set in the future, (where all the terminators keep coming from) Older John Connor, has lost sight of leading the Resistance. John's father, Kyle Reese, a young adult by now, is saved from a T-600 by Marcus Wright, a man who is unaware that he is also machine. John Connor and the rest of Resistance are unaware of Kyle's importance. John learns of a plan to shut down SkyNet, the main operations of the Machines. Marcus helps the resistance by aiding John Connor in the assault on the SkyNet base, where John is almost killed and receives the scar on his face you can see in this trailer, by a T-800 (Bad Arnie). John, his father Kyle, and Marcus, succeed in destroying the SkyNet base. John, badly wounded, is near death and Marcus gives John his own heart to allow him to live. Marcus is dead, and John and Kyle are ready to lead the Resistance. Which brings you back to the beginning of this timeline. So my theory is a time loop.  Note: In this trailer, Sarah Conner has stopped the T-800 from killing her when it was originally sent back in time in the events of ""Terminator 1"".   Hoped I helped.

2014-12-04T21:44:18,"I would like anyone who thinks that they have a good grasp on what this trailer leads us to believe is the plot of this movie to give this a thought. Now first and foremost I understand that this is a movie and was created as a source of entertainment and that getting to hung up on a fiction plot device like time travel is silly, but one thing stands out to me like a sore thumb about the plot. So from what we see in the trailer, for the first time we actually witness the moment that Kyle Reece and the T800 travel back in time to 1984(The original movies starting off point). But after a quick flash and some familiar shots we see that the timeline has been altered and that things are very different. Now here is my problem. We can argue from here to eternity about altering time lines that’s all fair enough we have seen it before, but this time within its own fictional logic makes absolutely no sense. Now try and follow me here because I’m not a scientist but as far as the Terminator series goes there is one event that has been consistent and for any of the films to make sense is pivotal and that moment as mentioned is in the trailer. The moment in question is the scene showing Reece and the T800 traveling back to 84. OK still with me,ok cool. Right so here’s my beef. THAT MOMENT HAD, HAS AND WILL ONLY HAPPEN ONCE!! So why are we seeing a second version of these events. If a terminator was sent back to when ever Sarah Connor was a child then that would have been the reality Reece would have arrived to in the original movie. Am I missing anything here because to me that really stands out as a huge blistering plot whole even within its own fictional logic? What im saying is 1984 and 2029 are like bookends to this series so anything in-between is fair game we can try and do whatever to stop the war and create various new timelines but the thing is no matter what changes we are still going to arrive to the moment they are sent back to 84. So if something was to go back further than 84 to let’s say 1970 then those events would have already taken effect before the first time Reece was sent back simply because IT HAPPENED BEFORE THEN!!! And I say first time because the series works as a loop not because he does it over and over, I simply mean the first iteration of this cycle would have been affected if anything was sent further back before his arrival. Thoughts? Because I would really like to enjoy this movie and I’m writing this not to dis it but because I want it to make a bit more sense.",0,0,steve earley,FqbOFjl7ZWE,0.16701786775316188,2014-12-04 21:44:18,True,True

2014-12-06T01:27:07,"Big terminator fan, adore T1 and T2 i actually enjoyed T3 it's a repeat of T2 but with judgement day actually happening which i found refreshing, however as a whole i do accept it's obvious insignificance. T Salvation was turd, they failed to authenticate the future war, john Connor's career, nothing new was bought to the table and Skynet seemed terribly senile in their methods of execution. This film looks exactly like what every other 5th film in an over exploited franchise looks like; DISPOSABLE! Using the whole ''T800 skin ages like a human'' as a plot device is so desperate it's laughable! They are doing this just to validate Arnie's role, to convince us that at nearly 70 years old he can still pull this off! The fact that they are going down this route dumbfounds me. And then you have old arnie shooting at a digitized 1984 arnie, ARE THE PRODUCERS HIGH?? Cos yeah that's really gonna work!!! LMFAO! Yeah let old arnie shoot at a musclebound arnie lookalike stunt double then replace the 2 way shot with a shot of arnie from T1. ahahahaha I JUST CRACKED UP WHEN I SAW THAT BIT! I'm just going along for the ride with this film. After salvation they have effectively buried this franchise, this film will have no redeeming features I promise you that folks! The fact that they are rehashing events from T1 & T2 just to please fans and retain some integrity sums up the credibility of the producers involved. They are just ridiculing terminator now. Time travel is only a small part of what made the first two so special because thematically they contain soo much more. This has now become a fairground attraction, a comedy, a parody. I can't take this trailer seriously but i will watch the finished product just to see if i could be wrong, possibly. You never know it might surprise me without contradicting the earlier films or the overall story arc. Still, gotta admire Arnie for reminding us that your never too old to be dangerous. However, the Korean guy now playing the T-1000 is soo corny! He's trying to do his best Robert Patrick impersonation but ends up being robotic. (see what i did there :P) and liquid metal CGI is embarrassing. How effects of today pale in comparison to effects from 1991 escape me.  If this trailer was fan made, it would break Guinness world records for being soo convincing as to pass off as a real trailer.

Why do we need to keep bastardizing one of cinemas most badass character by making these unnecessary sequel? And Why is it an unnecessary sequel?  1. The story ended in T2: judgement day. No future but that of what we make. The sequels just go against that theme 2. Nobody cares about future storyline. The appeal of the first two movies came from the idea that the dystopian future was mysterious. Who cares about how t800s are made, or what John Connor was like in the future. 3. Arnold is too old to play this character. Oh dont get me wrong, he will always be the terminator. But this is one lifetime behind him. There is no more sense for him to play it. Its good that he is still in great shape for his age, but the terminator right now hardly as appealing as it used to be. 4.

Don't get me wrong I love the guy but let's be real here he's getting grey, and while this isn't bad in a real life standpoint, it really stretches suspension of disbelief when a guy who's on the verge of needing a walker is walking around toting a shotgun and diving out of helicopters. Also it just makes no sense in a story perspective. Why did the model age, it's a robot with basically a synthetic plastic suit. Obviously they just kept him in for the popularity factor and to cater for the old school Terminator fans, and this isn't really a bad thing if they're going back to their roots.  I do like how they're going back to basics and sticking with what people like as opposed to Terminator Salvation, which was very meh among audiences; it was either hit or miss, with many being miss (33% on rotten tomatoes). However are they getting TOO back to basics?  By this I mean really? They're doing the ""we can stop judgement day"" thing again? And the Liquid terminator again? They didn't get that it didn't work the first time when they sent only ONE guy to kill Sarah Connor? TRY MORE THAN ONE THIS TIME YOU DINGUSES, HOW DID YOU GUYS EVER MANAGE TO TURN EARTH INTO A BATTLE ZONE?! I'm surprised they didn't just send in one liquid terminator to fight the entire army...  Anyway, rant over I'm a born cynic... But with the ""we can stop judgement day"" thing being done again... Didn't they get the memo from the third movie? Judgement day can't be stopped, only delayed. Well I guess this takes place between Terminator 1 and 2 but if that's the case they're just recycling the same twist of ""we can stop it"" and then going ""oh noooo we can't actually""? For real?  Hell maybe they'll do something different with it but right now it just looks like a generic sequel: Same exact stuff with juust enough tweaking so you can tell it's another movie, and from the franchise that had arguably the BEST MOVIE SEQUEL OF ALL TIME, that's a little disappointing.

2014-12-25T07:19:43,"On the one hand, T1 and T2 will be my favorites, since I was around back then. (Read: middle-age nostalgia)  This might be a good flick, but folks in 2014 are far more critical than they were 30 years ago. Truth. Every comment thread on YT looks like complete anarchy.  All I know is, after cruising YouTube for a long, long time, reading comments on music videos, movie trailers, etc, many folks want a film or band to be like they were back then: kick-ass.  What always amuses me, is why Hollywood doesn't invest the effort to make a truly ""theatrical"" film. What am I talking about, you ask? Simply this: ever wonder why the films back then (mostly pre-2000s era) are STILL so revered? And why these studios are trying to mine them for value now?   First of all, in spite of the exceedingly high levels of technology we have in 2014, you can't just...toss a bunch of CGI/SFX into a film and expect it to perform miracles. Let's face it, even with basic tech at their disposal, the old movies made use of better scripts, better lighting, better pacing, less WAS more. The original T1, the 1970s Star Wars films, the first TRON, the first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, etc.   Why are classic films like Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, It's A Wonderful Life, etc, still massively famous and entertaining? Very talented actors, plots with simple premises that utilized nuance and suggestion rather than in-your-face delivery ALL the time now.   This can apply to sci-fi, action, drama's, comedies, what have you. I'm not criticizing Terminator Genisys. From what I've read, the producers are at least trying to use footage from the old films. But really...why not reduce the overload of CGI, and go back to how it was done decades ago. Just because new tech exists, doesn't mean there is a gun to someone's head to use it ALL the time.  Just like the huge demand now for vintage recording equipment: Why? Because more bands want that organic sound that is impossible to get with digital. Just like photography. No matter how well digital is refined, film cameras create a more vivid shot, deeper, richer.   In conclusion, if fans want better films, and Hollywood wants money, WHY keep hammering out films without real depth?",0,0,Blacksand459,FqbOFjl7ZWE,0.2138203463203463,2014-12-25 07:19:43,True,True

2014-12-29T06:54:56,okay for all of those who are complaining about the movie right away and not knowing what the new plot is going to be about here it is. in the Future the resistance launches an attack on a SKYNET base (as Kyle explained to the shrink in the first T1) and John sends Kyle back to 1984 to protect his mother from the terminator. Kyle does go back to 1984 falling in the ally and is spotted by cops like in T1. but this 1984 is a different time line. Arnold's terminator traveled to the past when Sarah was a kid and raised her him/itself getting her ready for what is going to happen in 1984. when the younger Arnold terminator arrived in 84 the older Arnold was there waiting and destroyed the younger Arnold. and Sarah knew when and where Kyle will be arriving but SKYNET sent back a T1000 to this 1984. so go ahead complaining and hating the movie I think it is going to be great with wondering how it will end. also Emilia Clarke looks like shes gonna kick ass as Sarah Connor after being in Game of Thrones,1,0,thomas costa,FqbOFjl7ZWE,0.052279093455564044,2014-12-29 06:54:56,True,True

2015-01-07T17:15:55,"I like that fact they have an aged terminator. My nerd friends and I always wondered what if a Terminator would succeed in their mission. Would they shutdown, hide, continue the good fight? James Cameron, creator of the Terminator franchise was asked why there was a aged T800 (67 year old Arnold) in this movie. Even though Cameron has nothing to do with the film he was asked for input. He said that the aged terminator over shot his mark which he was traveling to, and since the T800 are living tissue that's why the Terminator aged. Also if you would rewatch the trailer you can see the Terminator carrying a small child, which I'm assuming that is a young Shara Connor. So I'm once again assuming that the T800 went back in Shara's past, saved her from something catastrophic and trained her for the future. I know this isn't the normal message for YouTube. But I'm pretty keyed up for this movie.

2015-02-13T15:51:59,"To everyone griping, bitching, and moaning about how awful this looks-- I can at least think of a few *good* things about it; one, Arnold Schwarzenegger properly returns to the role of the Terminator; two, the T-1000 returns (and the actor who they got to play him seems, at least at first, to replicate many of the traits that made Robert Patrick so intimidating as the first one); three, while it does seem to rehash the first movie *initially*, it quickly becomes apparent that NOTHING is the same as the first (a T1000 in 1984? Another T800 that arrived prior to the one in the first movie, and ended up raising Sarah Connor into a battle-hardened warrior whereas before in the original film she was just a scared waitress); and as to the story? God, *give them a chance*! You can complain all you want when the movie comes out, but for all you know, the story could be (and probably will be) explained more in depth in the movie itself, and might very well make perfect sense.  And (this is just personal opinion, so no flame wars, please) they TRIED the gritty, future war depiction approach in T4-- and it blew up in their faces EPICALLY; Salvation was, UNEQUIVOCALLY, was the *worst* Terminator film made yet (though, granted, the execution left a LOT to be desired, and could have been much better in the hands of a more talented director than friggin' *McG*). And as to the CGI? It has the T1000 in it, it's *gonna HAVE* to have CGI, get over it. Plus, what, complaints that its' *too glossy* means you want to retread things back to 1991 CG, ignoring the past 24 years of CG advancement? THAT just seems foolish to me, especially when the CG here looks a HELL of a lot better than most of what Hollywood has been producing the last few years.  In short? This movie has at least some real promise-- getting back to the roots (at least somewhat) of what made the first two films as good as they were-- granted, there are probably going to be some problems in execution, but could we at least try to keep a somewhat open mind and WAIT until the film comes out BEFORE we start lynching it as being unwatchable? *Please?!* ",0,0,DorianMichaelsIII,FqbOFjl7ZWE,0.10656702898550725,2015-02-13 15:51:59,True,True

Third, there always seems to be a cyborg from skynet sent back in time as well to kill Sarah Connor and it's up to the protagonist to have a long drawn out grueling and utterly boring battle using cheap cgi effects and to many explosions and lights to pacify the audience from noticing the lack of plot dynamic. And lastly, nothing ever progresses or changes for anything throughout any of the movies besides the fact that arnie is being given a role to play the for some reason terminator that ages and dives head first thru helicopters. And throw in an all cgi version of Arnold in his 30s muscle bound and all and you suddenly have another shit movie that is not going to be any different from its other predecessors.

But these effects look plastic and shiny. Might as well be watching Arnold in a Who Framed Roger Rabbit remake. Toss in a Hans Zimmer BWONG...BWONG...BWONG and a Transformers waaaaauuuuuhhhhhh quick pitch drop and there you have it.

2015-02-20T00:33:08,"Before the trailers or teasers of this movie, I was very excited, because I thought we were going to have a movie to see how these robots get sent through time, the back story of the time travel in the movies, or have the set of the future war in the first couple of movies and have this huge battle or even maybe some of the creation of the terminators (especially the 1000 series) and I couldn't wait for the first peek at a teaser. When I saw the first bit of news, I thought maybe some actors from the past terminator movies would be brought back and at the time I was thinking, ""Now it's a terminator movie!"" Now, looking at this I already see problems. The CGI for example. Did you see that terminator in the beginning? That looks more like a cartoon than a real looking robot. The effects in Salvation were top notch and now we're getting meh? This also looks partially like a remake of the first few films. Some people find that exciting but lemme tell you, the first two films are excellent the way they are. The action and effects are stunning. From what I see in the story, it seems like instead of Kyle protecting Sarah, Sarah's protecting Kyle and I find that a little weird but also a bit interesting as a little twist or something. The acting seems a little off from what I'm seeing. Jason Clarke is alright I suppose, Arnold is good as always :), Emilia Clarke I really don't know, she doesn't really seem that good, Jai Courtney I suppose he's alright from what I've seen from this trailer. While talking about the actors, I think the choice of some of them were  incorrect. The T-1000 for example. I remember him as thin, menacing. This actor isn't as menacing when looking at these scenes. Sarah Conner? All I can really say is that she's not the best actor. Linda Hamilton really is better for the role. A bus hits a small little car and flips 50 feet off the ground?  So, in conclusion, I'm not really looking forward to this but actually looking at the trailer itself and what it has to offer in the story it gives as an idea for the film, it's interesting, and I slightly approve of it.",0,0,Seth Nowac,FqbOFjl7ZWE,0.12547348484848486,2015-02-20 00:33:08,True,True

To be fair, that was the plan too with Terminator: Salvation, but there does seem to be a little more confidence this time around.  Paramount's certainly been open about its plans in that regard, with Terminator: Genisys 2 - which it won't be called - already set for May 19th 2017. And in a surprise to very few people on the planet indeed, Arnold Schwarzenegger has revealed that he'll be back - arf - for that one as well. He confirmed his reappearance to The Arnold Fans, as well as the fact that he'll be filming what'll be Terminator 6 next year.  Most of the key cast for Terminator: Genisys are believed to be on three picture deals. Matt Smith's character, for instance, we're only set to find out too much more about later in the trilogy.  Terminator: Genisys is set for release in July 2015. Also in its cast are Jason Clarke, Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney, Oscar-winner J K Simmons and Byung Hun Lee.

2019-11-06T18:21:13,I honestly feel like they ruined everything with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003).  I loved T1 for the horror aspects. T2 for the action aspects. T3 was just plain awful. Another liquid metal terminator. More time travel. A complete breakdown of story continuity... it was a cash grab “transformers” style movie.  T: Salvation... they went for something new and got raked over the coals. I liked it though.  I skipped Genesis. The trailer was a yet another liquid metal t-1000 and young Sarah... more time travel. Stoppppppp. I don’t want to see what looked to be T-2 again. For the 3rd time.  Now Dark Fate. Another liquid metal (ish) terminator. The terminator isn’t terrifying. Shots of an ICE facility. John is replaced by a female. There’s (another) female terminator... beating up police. And Sarah is acting like a caricature. It’s the 4th T2 style movie. figured I would wait for reviews.  Fatigue? Yes... absolutely. They’ve been trying to capture lightning in a bottle with everything after T2.  What I would have liked to have seen is a Terminator 3 is Skynet going online. No terminators. Terminator 4 the future war and the end. It ties in to T1 and T2.,0,0,Michael Maslowski,FqbOFjl7ZWE,0.0886038961038961,2019-11-06 18:21:13,False,False
