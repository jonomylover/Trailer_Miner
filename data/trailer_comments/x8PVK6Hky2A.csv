She isn't some sort of acting messiah though. People need to stop bowing down to people like this.   Her comments about Walt Disney were lies. He was not misogynistic racist or anti Semitic. If she cared to do her research she would find that he hired all three groups and allowed them to progress regardless of their status.  Females would do basic work because they lacked education however they were able to move forward. They would often get pregnant and not be allowed to work. Disney adopted a baby girl. not boys to outdo his other daughter. He paid his employees the best.   People need to read up about the strike. they accused him of awful things and he in turn accused them of being greedy people which they were. 700 dollars a week was enough for everyone.  He even let workers come back after the strike when it failed for them.  None of his loyal workers (most women all the black and most Jewish workers) stayed on and worked for him and didn't say anything bad years later.  he expected the best and treated everyone nicely. he wasn't Steve Jobs.   Meryl streep is over hyped and wouldn't be anywhere without nepotism and the casting couch her fake charities make her even more false.  Disney will be remembered forever. streep will be exposed like all Hollywood fakes do.,0,0,Coco Pops,x8PVK6Hky2A,0.06855158730158731,2015-09-07 17:34:02,False,True
