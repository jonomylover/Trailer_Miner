2016-09-29T03:08:41,"Here's my take on the Grindenwald aspect, and I could be entirely wrong here. I think these three films going to have major time jumps, sort of chronicling Scamander's life and exploits in a similar fashion to Indy Jones (except forward rather than Indy's backward chronology). I think this pic sets up and maybe in motion the forces that allow for Grindenwald's rise to power and eventually the world wizarding war that takes place basically concurrently with world war two. In other words, my guess is next movie takes place in the 1930s and the last film in the 40s, ending with Dumbledore's victory over his former friend (unrequited lover?) in 1945. Could make for a great and natural blending of the new characters and world in America with those we know and love from Harry Potter. And give Rowling the chance to showcase a younger Dumbledore and possibly delve into his backstory (both with Grindenwald and his sis) that was so sadly cut out of much of the last Potter films.",0,0,Jonathan Guito,Vso5o11LuGU,0.04211647727272727,2016-09-29 03:08:41,True,True

2016-10-02T21:31:08,"Ok, that's it, I've had enough! To all you people in the comments going ""Uuuuuuugh, there's CGI in this movie? They shoulda used practical effects!"" Really? Really? Ok, CGI is not the bane of Christ or an instant movie killer. Quite the opposite really. It's a tool used to help make movies better and that's it. And like any tool it can be used and misused. One of the biggest things I see people complaining about in this movie is the CGI on the magical beasts. Keyword: magical. People, practical effects are great and can be used effectively, I will not deny that. But for goodness sakes, creating puppets for every single one of those creatures would cost so much money that it wouldn't even be funny. They probably wouldn't even be able to AFFORD the actors. Also, here's another reason using puppets for them wouldn't work: Range of motion. These things are flying, running, bending down, glowing, exploding, and doing a whole lot of other stuff that you just couldn't do with CGI. I mean, ever seen a puppet or animatronic in a movie run around with that range of motion? No, it moves its arms, limbs, and sometimes its torso. Rarely ever do you actually see them doing some of the crazy stuff these things are and will be doing. And for the record, yes, practical effects were used for some of the creatures in the Harry Potter movies, the basilisic being most notable. But ones like Buckbeak, Dobby, and the dragons were all clearly cgi and I don't see anyone complaining about THEM! So, do us all a favor and shut your mouths and wait to see how effective it is and stop blaming CGI for making a movie you haven't even seen yet the reason you hate it. Going ""Ugh, CGI, how lame"" is like going ""Ugh, a movie, how lame"". It's ridiculous, immature, and just plain annoying.",179,26,Callian r,Vso5o11LuGU,0.08946552579365077,2016-10-02 21:31:08,True,True

I liked that I didn't know much about it before (the trailers don't show too much). I'd say it's more for adults than for kids. You don’t see that many jokes or goofy parts and there basically aren't any child characters. Well except few creepy ones... I really liked Dan Fogler, his character is amazing and loveable. Eddie Redmayne on the other hand isn't my cup of tea for this role. I'd like to see someone else in that role but since I don't like to be too whiny, I tolerate him as Newt and maybe his character doesn't have to be the coolest and toughest one after all. There's this cool suprise towards the end which I really didn't expect. It's only few seconds, but it's nice. I'd watch this movie again few times.

We are by all means are entertained by advanced special effects by it was not the crucial factor of so beloved Harry Potter. We are witnessing Eddie Redmayne trying on his new suit and he is so uncomfortable in it, it is actually disturbing.

Some movies are okay,  some are good. Soundtrack was always great and I´m fine with the special effects. Sadly, I can´t say this about the Phantastic Beasts movie.   It´s lacking any higher level plot and the whole movie doesn´t feel coherent. The soundtrack is almost  imperceptible, the visual effects are worse than 2001 Lord of the Rings or 1999 Matrix and the characters are 100% one dimensional. Especially  the rendering of the beasts was really bad and unconvincing. The number of scenes which were just annoying or didn´t contribute anything to the plot were pretty high.   Overall, it´s a bad movie. Only made for a further cash up using the Potter lore. I hope there won´t be a sequel to this and as a fan of the HP universe, I´m exceedingly disappointed.",0,0,Andre,Vso5o11LuGU,0.0036438923395445267,2016-12-21 09:38:28,False,True
