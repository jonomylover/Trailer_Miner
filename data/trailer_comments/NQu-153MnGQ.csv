Now in the sequel, Dory must find her lost family that she doesn't remember where they are, but she found them in the located wildlife sea center at California and she tags along with Marylyn and Nemo and the rest of colorful fish buddies. Ellen finally coming back as memorable Dory and she did a good job for playing a fish memento character. I like her back story of her childhood which she tries to remember and she follows along with her path to find them. The movie does has some clever scenes like the colorful fish characters, Marylyn and Nemo were back again and they both did their roles good, and Dory's quest to parents is interesting.
