Each story is a bit different, but it still gives the similar racial features. ""Al-lad-din."" That is how Disney has protrayed this character and even took away how to even say his name correctly. Well, I can't blame people for messing up my easy indian name if they can't say ""Alla-Dean."" That might not be how it is spelled, but that is how you see Alladin correctly in the orignal way. I've seen old shows about Alladin in my languge and they are nothing to how they are protrayed in this movie. Why can't we have any actors from the countries I've mention above play these characters. My cousin is a actor and in England, his Indian look are accepted and he is in shows. I'd wish these actors looked more like me. I never see actors in American movies look like me, dark skined, dark brown hair, dark brown eyes, and deep voices. Is too much for Disney to make their characters more realistic, true to their origins, and less sexualized so kids like my nieces and little siblings can look up to them more?

And the cave is god awful, whoever has worked on this movie is..... Guy Ritchie..... you‚Äôve got to be fucking kidding me, the guy who‚Äôs made the terrible King Arthur movie, seriously? How unoriginal and uncreative can you people get!? The cave should be moving, alive and animated, not a fucking still you‚Äôd put on one for your reused-story-Disney on Ice performances. The fade ins and fade outs to make this movie look ‚Äúmagical‚Äù is fucking fake and is getting really old.  Stop remaking your classics and start making NEW ONES with original ideas. I‚Äôve had it, I‚Äôm fucking fed up with you and this god awful monopoly you‚Äôve built. Fox, Marvel, Star Wars, you need to back the fuck off. Beauty and the Bleh was absolute trash and I hope to god it‚Äôs forgotten. Dumbo looks just as bad and looks NOTHING like a Tim Burton movie, and oh my Jesus, The Nutcrakcer is even worse. A perfect story with an amazing HARD WORKING creative ballet tradition that will be thrown away into piss poor garbage for a political agenda is disgraceful (and yes, there is a fucking political narrative to those films with Disney being fucking stupid in the SJW Hollywood and dspaite the fact Four Realls and B&B17 are by the same director who is terrible at his job and is uninventive, they both LOOK LIKE the same movie for gods sake)!   This is why Pixar and the Animation Studios ALONE will always have my full respect, despite the fact that Wreck It Ralph 2 is pondering to SJW‚Äôs by making Tiana darker for whatever reason and havin a strong female feminist message showing through the trailers, but nevertheless I can still look past that (hopefully) because I fucking enjoyed Wreck it Ralph. They are always 100% more original than what you‚Äôve become within the past 3 fucking years (yeah no shit they do sequels, they gotta make money, but either way, you have to admit that they put more work into their films than these live action adaptations that are being pumped out YEARLY by the numbers since it‚Äôs a trend to follow Marvel studios and the MCU‚Äôs style of filmmaking).  But holy Christ have I had it. I‚Äôm sure people will start doing the same if they‚Äôd just wake up and open their eyes. But seriously though, Disney, stop it. Do what you do best with animation and creating ORIGINAL stories and content (don‚Äôt even get me started on what you do with your parks, because you‚Äôre just fucking idiots when it comes to that and disrespectful).

But the moment I heard the similar theme from the cartoon version as well as same voiceover from the Cave of Wonder, I realize this isn't going to be a fresh unique take on a familiar story. I miss the days when Disney put effort in creating a fresh narrative interpretation of a fable. These days, they're recycling what we've already seen before, merely putting on another coat of paint over the older layer.  The old phase used to be 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. But I think that phase should be updated to say 'if it ain't broke, don't remake it... not unless you have something new to say in regards to narration.'",0,0,RadiusZero,9g5knnlF7Zo,0.14533799533799535,2018-10-12 04:21:26,True,True

You know Aladdin is gay, Jasmine is an insufferable SJW, Abu is probable a transgender, and Jafar will likely be a middle age Christian white straight business owner who is the pinnacle of evil of their time. The movie plot will be that Jafar wants more cow farms to turn all the vegans into carnivores so global warming will raise sea levels so his castle will become ocean front property. Aladdin and Jasmine team up with genie to convince Jafar to understand his white privilege so that he ends up giving his home to black genie for reparations. Aladdin then wishes for all cows to become soy plants and banana trees. Global warming is thwarted and all the white people are turned into slave laborers in the soy fields where they are constantly mocked and whipped with pleasure because brown people can't be racist. Aladdin can't use his third wish to free genie because Jasmine thinks that idea sounds rasist, instead genie finds out he was always free but was oppressed by the white man Jafar. Aladdin then uses his last wish instead to grant universal basic income, free health care, and free college to all citizens of Agraba who can now get free abortions without feeling guilty.

2018-10-12T05:11:30,"Wow. Will Smith as the Genie? Thats... nuts. Disney should just approach Robin Williams estate, and respectfully request to re-use the voice recordings from Robin Williiams original performance. Disney can CG Animate the new Genie around that. They'd have hours of out-takes and improv from Robin as well (becase that's how he worked) so you could do a lot of new lines and scenes. There's no need to replace Robin Williams when you can re-use him.  As for who could do it better than Will Smith? My vote is almost anybody. He has almost no range. Robin Williams could play everything from a terrifying stalker in One Hour Photo, to a tragic/comic radio host in Good Morning Vietnam to a mournfully inspiring teacher in Dead Poets society.  Will Smith pretty much plays... Will Smith. Will Smith the MIlitary Pilot in Independence Day, Will Smith the Lone Survivor in I Am Legend, Will Smith the Cowboy in Wild Wild West, Will Smith pretty much as Will Smith in a suit in Men in Black - (they didn't even really try at all with that one). I might give him props for Ali or Pursuit of Happyness, but it's really rare for him to stretch himself. Who could do it better? How about Jim Carey? Mike Meyers? Sasha Baron Cohen? Geez, Mel Brooks did just voicework for Hotel Transylvania 3 this year and the guys 92 years old. He'd do better than Will Smith.  Or go PC.  Flip it and give the role to Sarah Silverman, Maya Rudolph, Lilly Tomlin.

You can't just abandon something that was once great and remake it for the sake of money. That is just lazy and destroys everything that the original movies stood for. What would Walt Disney say if he saw this with his own eyes? He would be really dissapointed. You guys keep on saying ""For the memory of Robin Williams"", but even Robin Williams himself would be baffled and dissapointed from the current direction and situation Disney is taking their buisness practices. I know money is important, but is it that important that we shouldn''t even try anymore to make something creative and imaginative? The Lion King 2D animated movie inspired and made me love animation and now once a great movie that even won an Oscar is being freaking remade and have Byonce as a voice actress.

I just find it unnecessary. I don't think the new live-action version can outmatch the original 1992 animated version. I'm sorry, but it just can't. No matter how hard Disney tried. I really wished that Disney can only remake their worst and weaker films. Why not remake 2D traditional hand-drawn animated films of Chicken Little and The Wild? Why not remake Home on the the Range into a 3D computer animated film? And why not remake The Black Cauldron into a live-action film? Just to make plenty of room for improvement. Like improving the story and character development. Just make them worthy Disney classics, ok? But don't remake anymore perfect original animated films ever again, after that.

Jasmine's outfit is definitely based on a fetisized idea of 'exotic' woman, and is pretty disrespectful. I'm also not slut-shaming.

Stop putting all the emphasis on what looks good and let the story telling fall through like a sack of bricks.  Aladdin had an entertaining set of characters that did well to not overexert themselves to please the audience.  Yes Robin Williams had a wacky character but it was only due to his incredible acting through a fictional character that is worked wonders.  Simple scenes like when the sultan took a carpet ride on after Prince Alibaba was all the film needed to win over the audience.  If your going too realistic you cant incite the humor like when the bird slammed into a pancake after running for his life from the sultan bashing into him with the carpet.  Simple effects like this was all that was needed.  Not unnecessary over the top graphics that take up too much screen time!  Your not trying to make another Avatar so don't try!  Aladdin's character was crafty, selfish, and stubborn.  He spoke from the heart and expressed his frustrations openly even if it hurt those around him.  Don't try too hard to make him the protagonist from the start, he only became the hero after all his lies were laid bare and had no choice but to fight Jufar and show his real worth ""which lies far within"".",35,10,Avo,9g5knnlF7Zo,0.20271739130434785,2018-10-12 16:20:55,True,True

Also if he's supposed to be Chinese, why in the world would he be named Aladdin?? That's an Arabian name. What is he doing in an Arab country in the first place?! In my opinion Aladdin is Arabian, because that's how logic it should be, and if Disney did really make him a CHINESE person who lives in an ARABIAN Country, with the name ALADDIN, having the SAME SKIN AS ARABS, the same LOOKS, and he's STILL CHINESE!!

2018-10-12T18:49:29,"When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.‚ÄìThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ‚ÄìThat whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.‚ÄìSuch has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.¬† He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.¬† He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:¬† For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.¬† He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.¬† He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.  We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",0,0,The Theatre Guy,9g5knnlF7Zo,0.13144283286806654,2018-10-12 18:49:29,True,True

The fade ins and fade outs to make this movie look ‚Äúmagical‚Äù is fucking fake and is getting really old.  Stop remaking your classics and start making NEW ONES with original ideas. I‚Äôve had it, I‚Äôm fucking fed up with you and this god awful monopoly you‚Äôve built. Fox, Marvel, Star Wars, you need to back the fuck off. Beauty and the Bleh was absolute trash and I hope to god it‚Äôs forgotten. Dumbo looks just as bad and looks NOTHING like a Tim Burton movie, and oh my Jesus, The Nutcrakcer is even worse. A perfect story with an amazing HARD WORKING creative ballet tradition that will be thrown away into piss poor garbage for a political agenda is disgraceful (and yes, there is a fucking political narrative to those films with Disney being fucking stupid in the SJW Hollywood and dspaite the fact Four Realls and B&B17 are by the same director who is terrible at his job and is uninventive, they both LOOK LIKE the same movie for gods sake)!   This is why Pixar and the Animation Studios ALONE will always have my full respect, despite the fact that Wreck It Ralph 2 is pondering to SJW‚Äôs by making Tiana darker for whatever reason and havin a strong female feminist message showing through the trailers, but nevertheless I can still look past that (hopefully) because I fucking enjoyed Wreck it Ralph. They are always 100% more original than what you‚Äôve become within the past 3 fucking years (yeah no shit they do sequels, they gotta make money, but either way, you have to admit that they put more work into their films than these live action adaptations that are being pumped out YEARLY by the numbers since it‚Äôs a trend to follow Marvel studios and the MCU‚Äôs style of filmmaking).  But holy Christ have I had it. I‚Äôm sure people will start doing the same if they‚Äôd just wake up and open their eyes. But seriously though, Disney, stop it. Do what you do best with animation and creating ORIGINAL stories and content (don‚Äôt even get me started on what you do with your parks, because you‚Äôre just fucking idiots when it comes to that and disrespectful).

And with today's technology, there is no reason why a hand drawn 2d style can't be done on a tablet.   I grew up watching your movies, and those of Don Bluth as well.  They were inspiring enchanting, and surreal.  And the qualities of moving exaggerated forms, 2d paints given life, was stylistically appealing in its own ways. It brought a reality that that activated and energized the imagination and brought color and warmth through generalization that every little hair on a rendered CGI lion cannot.  You inspired me to love art, I thank you for that.  I just wish you would open your eyes and see the Never lands and Wonderlands that can only be found by your original style.    I'm not against realistic movies, I love CGI films, but I feel like there's been something missing for a long time.

I find that very disappointing considering Robin himself didn't want the original movie to succeed because he was in it, rather because it was a good movie in it's own right. It's like you people don't even care about his wishes. The whole reason it was so hard to get him to come back was because of how over advertised he was for being a part of the cast. Robin Williams' lack of involvement never bothered me in Return of Jafar, the Aladdin tv series, or even in Kingdom Hearts. If the franchise hadn't done so well without him, we wouldn't have even HAD a King of Thieves movie for him to return to in the first place! Will Smith is an awesome actor.

Will Smith has the energy to bring a cartoon to life and his vocal range isn't like Robin's, but can do it justice. Stop comparing to the old and enjoy it for what it is. Will Smith already has impossible shoes to fill. I think he's brave for even trying, knowing half of Williams fans want him nowhere near the role. As long as he can bring to the table even a fraction of what Williams did, I'll be happy. I'm going to enjoy each of them for what they are, separately.

2018-10-13T05:11:30,"Although, I don't have much hope of this being a good film, Will Smith as the genie is a boss choice. Will Smith may not be Robin Williams, but I can see him having so much fun with the role. I'm just assuming that he's the genie. I haven't looked at anything about it, because I'm not interested in the Disney remakes, but it's the only thing that makes sense to me. If it turns out he's Jafar, then I'm definitely not going to watch it, because that's some serious miscasting right there.   Although, to be fair, this is probably one of the movies that could definitely be improved with a remake. The original is definitely dated, by this point. So, hopefully, this time they'll cut the pop culture references. Disney, of all companies, shouldn't be afraid to try new things. I'm a firm believer that if you're going to remake a product, then you should take it in a whole new direction. I liked the Jungle Book remake, because barring a few of the musical numbers, which fans would riot over if they weren't included, the movie was very different from the original. I don't know if I would place it in my favourite Disney movies, but I respect them for at least trying to do something different.   Please, Disney, do not just refilm the original movie with live actors. There would be no point in that. And I refuse to pay to see Aladdin twice over. I would be more likely to go see a re-release of the original film.   I'm not going to lie. A part of me does want to see Will Smith as the genie rap ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"", but that's just the 90s kid in me, and should be ignored. But maybe as a blooper or after the credits roll.

2018-10-13T10:01:27,"meh, the trailer feels like any other trailer for a life action disney reboot, they know how to hype you up but in the end it will be nothing more than a bunch of actors wandering around in empty or overfull sets with a shitload of CGI stuffed in their to make it feel more ""epic"" but really it kinda takes away the magic, personality and soul that the original animated classic brought to the table all those years ago. sure kids and the easily amused casual movie go'er will probably get a kick out of it but the hardcore disney fanatics and your socially retarded internet dwellers will call betrayal and will be super duper offended for really reals. Some movie critics will probably give you a well thought out opinion about it and others will say whatever it takes to get more butts in the theater seats. I'll admit that this teaser kinda sparks my curiosity but ofcourse when I go out and watch it the film itself, I will compare it to the animated classic but I will also look if the film brings anything new to the table and/or if they add in some stuff from the original 1001 night story. The last thing I'll say is that i'm willing to approach this movie with an open mind but that it will probably be hard for me to judge will smith's version of the genie fairly, seeing how the late Robin William's version of the genie is for one so iconic and memorably and second the fact that robin william's genie is one of my favourite movie characters of all time.",65,17,Tom Thedutchguy,9g5knnlF7Zo,0.16964472309299894,2018-10-13 10:01:27,True,True

An idea would be to cut the original vocal parts out of Genie (Robin) and do a new better animated Genie, (with the voice of Robin).  I really like Will Smith but it‚Äôs just such a magical moment of memories so perhaps a way to keep everyone happy is to use takes from the original vocal and build them into a 2019 animated Genie for this reboot.

Like a great man once said about the remake of majora's mask is that when creators don't understand what was good about the original they can't do well with a remake, you have to embrace what makes it unique and double down. Look at marvel movies respecting source and then just going for it while most other franchises like dc would try to remove the outlandish nature of their characters marvel embraces them.

It is a website designed for home buyers and sellers to connect with honest and timely professionals in the real estate industry (from real estate agents, lenders, landscapers, painters, home inspectors etc). We have 2 competitors in the market but both include collecting and selling someone‚Äôs personal information before they can even be matched with professionals. We are simplifying this process and will never ask for a consumer‚Äôs personal information in order to find professionals in their area. Our website has been estimated to cost $50,000 to build and launch nationwide. We are looking for any sort of donations to help and also any investors that are interested. We are sending out a ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Mug‚Äù with any donation $40 and over. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for your time and learning a little bit about MuvzU!

The Aladdin original movie is so iconic to me because not only was it released in theaters in 1992(Just five months after my birth-day), but through-out my child-hood and even into my young adult life, my mother along with a couple other close friends and families           nicknamed me ""David: the Diamond in the Rough"". Also I relate very close to Aladdin's character as I was raised in the lower class, been called many mean names growing up, yet always wanted to  know what it is like   to live in the upper-class American life. Also I melt when I see a beautiful woman who I really wish was single and that I might have the chance of    asking her out and then having the potential of falling in love, getting a ring on her   finger and having a wonderful life together in our castle with some kids of our own. Yeah the      good life.

Unless he can act as crazy as he used to when he first started in the 90s, I just don't see it.   i know no one will ever fill Robin's shoes, but I still feel like they could have casted an actor who still focuses on being funny and less on being serious and action filled, cuz that's how I see Smith anymore...  but hey maybe Smith will surprise us, maybe this is him trying to jump back into funny roles again and get out of the serious action hero style he's been in for a few years now.",0,0,Keeta,9g5knnlF7Zo,0.04870370370370372,2018-10-14 03:40:35,True,True

For instance, the Sultan is referred to as such rather than being called the ""Emperor"", as in some re-tellings, and the people in the story are Muslims: their conversation is larded with devout Muslim platitudes. A¬†Jewishmerchant buys Aladdin's wares (and incidentally cheats him), but there is no mention of¬†Buddhists¬†or¬†Confucians¬†(or other distinctively Han Chinese people).  China's ethnic makeup has long included Muslim groups, including large populations of the¬†Hui people¬†whose origins go back to¬†Silk Road¬†travellers. In addition, large communities of Muslim Chinese have been known since the¬†Tang Dynasty, as well as¬†Jewish communities. Some have even suggested that the intended setting may be¬†Turkestan¬†(encompassing¬†Central Asia¬†and the modern Chinese province of¬†Xinjiang).

During this time period, a majority of India (excluding the south) had been taken over by an Arabic sultan; that is the kingdom of Agra in India (and others). so to summarize, the kingdom is technically Arabic but in the country of India.

2018-10-15T22:25:19,So I just read a little bit of Juicy news regarding this project.  Terry Rossio is a film writer and one of the co-writers of the animated Aladdin and was turned down by Disney when he offered monetary compensation for the use of scripted dialogue that he himself authored and is being repurposed for this production. Because when the first movie was being made nobody anticipated Disney would one day undergo this project of live-action remakes as such nothing within the writers contract was included to guarantee credit for such an occurrence. In other words despite being based off of another person script Disney is under no legal obligation to pay Terry Rossio or any other writer of the Disney animated features that they are now rewriting. Now that could have done it anyway out of sheer Goodwill but apparently that's not in the cards. So not only is Disney making the incredibly risky decision to release Aladdin without Robin Williams and expect for lightning to strike twice to make the fastest gain they can but they are also not giving credit to the people who actually made these movies that they are now starting over despite using a lot of the original scripted word.

2018-10-15T22:38:53,"Yeah, sorry, no....it's not even the Robin Williams thing entirely (though, of course, you never had a prayer of replacing him). Here's why I won't pay to see this:  The formula used - shot-for-shot copying the original film's teaser, using the music from the animated film, showing incredibly bland looking actors who look NOTHING like the animated counterparts - is EERILY similar to what we saw with the live action Beauty and the Beast. And what we got with that film was...just bad. I'm sorry, it was bad. Emma Watson cannot sing. She doesn't look like Belle at all (nor would I ever buy her as the ""most beautiful girl in the town"" - let's be honest. She's cute. But she's also a bit odd looking and mannish in some ways). The CGI just made the enchanted denizens of the castle look creepy, and a lot of it fell flat because it was directly comparing itself to a film that was infinitely superior and, MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL: never needed to be remade in live action, or at all.  Aladdin holds up to viewings even today. It's a good movie. It's a classic. It's fun. It has Robin Williams for crying out loud. It is the childhood many of us remember. If you want kids today to be introduced to the story of Aladdin, then just re-release Aladdin and advertise the hell out of it. Just release the animated film in theaters. TRUST ME, kids will still love it. But this? Why? Why make it at ALL? There IS no point. That's the issue here. You didn't set out to try a new take on Aladdin's story that does its own thing and does not attempt to pointlessly mime the 1992 film. No, no, no. What you did here is shamelessly take what was already done, by your own studios, cannibalize it, and regurgitate it at the audience in hopes of making some cash. This is very obviously not done for artistic purposes. It is done as a cash grab, and I am calling Disney on it right now.   Shame on you, Disney. Is nothing - not even your own classics - sacred? Look. If I write a book, and it's received really well, and it becomes a classic, should I in 25 years re-write it, only this time slightly changing some things and adding photos of real people, and try to pass that off as a new thing? Shouldn't I be called on it for doing that? Exactly.   Stop, Disney. Trust me on this. Just stop the live action remakes of films that didn't NEED to be remade or retold because they were so perfect the first time around. Plus, 2D animation actually allows for you to get away with visuals that just look stupid or weird in live action. 2D animation isn't a BAD thing. It's not an antiquated thing to be covered up with live action remakes. Be PROUD of the past. Be PROUD of the beauty of those 2D animated features. They're wonderful. If ANYTHING, Disney should be fighting hard to keep traditional animation alive and well. It's not as if kids today, who have no conception of chronology of technology, will see something that looks like Aladdin (1992) and say ""no thanks, I'll take Will Smith genie instead because it's newer"". It's not as if the bright colors and bombastic nature of the animation doesn't still appeal to young minds. ADULTS are the ones trying to blame traditional animation for the declining box office grosses we saw toward the end of the 1990s and into the early 2000's. But it was NEVER the animation style that was the issue. It was that films like Pocahontas, Treasure Planet, et al, simply did not appeal to children because they forgot how to have FUN. The films became lame. The writing became bad or overly heavy-handed. Things became too political and too much thought was given to how PC something was, race this, color that, gender this, blah blah blah. See, kids don't care about things like that. They do not care. I was a kid in 1992. I saw Aladdin in theaters. I remember the feeling. It was fantastic and I loved it. If my 9 year old self could see the original and then see the trailer for this, I'd call it a copy, and I would not be interested, because it comes off as flat and uninspired, even if at that age I wouldn't be able to translate that feeling into a coherent sentence.   Disney. You need to respect the beauty of traditional hand-drawn animation. It has a place, even now, and it always will - IF you write it for kids and drop the socio-political agenda plaguing films these days (did you *really* need to insert a gay character into Beauty and the Beast? No. no you didn't. Equality is all well and good but make a NEW film with a gay character if you simply must have one, and stop going back and bastardizing your own works (or should I say....the works of the last generation of filmmakers who were in every way your superiors) just to appease some segment of the population that always whines if every single group that ever existed isn't represented in every single film ever made.   Tell you what. I'll make you a deal. If you go back to the drawing board after this film and your inevitable Mulan remake (which, by the way, damned well better not have a bunch of white and black people in there for ""diversity"" - this was ancient China - don't pretend it is anything else) and you ASK yourself ""Why did The LIttle Mermaid work so well for so long? Why did The Lion King? Why did Beauty and the Beast (animated)? Why did Aladdin (animated)? Why are THOSE films still so beloved by so many after all these years? ASK yourselves that, I implore you, and try to condense the answer to a list of commonalities between these beloved classics.   And then, if you can fathom why it is that those films are still so loved and were then as well, and you take that understanding and set out to make a timeless classic animated (not CGI, lazy-asses) film that does NOT have the usual modern aggressively PC agenda...set out to truly make an animated film with EXACTLY the energy and mindset and thought processes used in those earlier films, and approach it like it still IS 1991...IF YOU CAN DO THAT....I will not only go to see your movie in theaters, but I will actively promote it, for free, across every corner of the web I can reach. And so will many others. There's something missing in Disney films and it is that heart and spirit that carried across in the late 80's/early 90s. Recapture it. Don't try to recreate it in live action. That won't work. But you will maybe finally start to realize that when this, too, is met with a lot of displeasure from audiences (look at the comments here - plenty of people are asking why you even felt the need to do this and are saying you can never replace Robin Williams - so you already have a problem right out of the gate).  I say all of this, Disney, because I believe that you still CAN make great original films. If you just stop making live action remakes of everything that did well in the past. It's .... kind of pathetic, to be honest.",0,0,Kalevipoeg,9g5knnlF7Zo,0.14580544455544456,2018-10-15 22:38:53,True,True

Also, the story is set sometime around the middle ages in the middle east. Its not the matter of religion or culture. It's the society back then, people of that time consider 12+ are adults. There are no such thing as Teenager. The term is relativly new in terms of civilazations across time. Im sure some of you are thinking ""what about Islam and some other culture that still does ""child"" marriege?"" Well see, those cultures and practices were created during those era(some are even earlier). All religions thats created during those era have the same law regarding child marrieges, Christians, Islam, Judaism, Hindus, etc. All the same, they allow child marrieges believe it or not. RN you might be saying, ""well im in one of those religion and i dont agree on child marrieges"", well thats fine, if you care to search up, none of those religion says ""YOU MUST!"". Noo, alright, those laws were just tyere saying that this is the age of consent for you to marry, it doesnr mean u have to marry right after or shortly after the age of consent. RN tho, lets be real, some of u, r thinkijg abt Islam specifically, in Islam, their prophet Muhammad, married, suprisingly, to only 1 wife,    the other 11 women he ""married"" to are to protect them from great lost, back in middle ages eras widows are troubled, very troubled, especially widows with children. Being the prophet, he wanted to set out an example to show thw future generation to do what he does while helping the troubled widows. He didnt married them out of lust. His representation and his way of life became of what some of you knows as, Shria law,  the shria law is NOT an obsolute must obey rule, it's just the thing the prophet did that people take note of, to show generarion to come to maybe try the same thing if they wanted to. (Heres a fun fact) Suprisingly, Muhammad is a very shy person, regardless of he's position. Btw, that 1 wife he married to, was older than him..... also he married at the age of 25....  Something small to know of, is that, sometimes, it's best to not compare olden moral standard with modern moral standards.    üòÖsrry to give out such lecture, ik its a pain reading them. and by all mean im not angry while typing all this. I just feel like some people can benefit from this very verym tiny knowledge of mine. Gatta thx my history professor and yt channels, and approved history sites.

2018-10-18T14:43:34,"I know that Will Smith is a charming guy and they're probably banking on him doing a good enough Genie that's going to be a different take from Robin Williams' iconic portrayal.   Here's the thing -- Genie doing all those impressions, while showing off Robin's voice-acting chops, also worked in the context of the character being an ancient and powerful shape-shifting deity who's seen it all and done it all. It wasn't just a comedian doing impressions -- Williams pretty much disappeared into the role and we buy him as this powerful but playful cosmic entity who's been unleashed after a long time.  I like Will Smith just fine but it's going to take an insane amount of willpower to separate the actor from the role in this case. Being separated from the role was never really Will Smith's thing -- he just kind of plays himself in every role he's been given, apart from the odd dramatic role like in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" where he still plays Will Smith except he cries a lot. In this, we're all pretty much just going in knowing that Will Smith's going to Will Smith all over the place with his role as Big Blue Wish-Granting Will Smith.",0,0,TheGuitar Person,9g5knnlF7Zo,0.13333333333333336,2018-10-18 14:43:34,True,True

Everything Disney's ever done in the last 50 years have been remaking already existing media to fit their ""vision"". Granted, remaking your own media is silly, but that doesn't mean that this isn't just typical Disney, and have ALWAYS been typical Disney.   Very few, if any, of their big budget cartoons have been original stories. Some are blatant rip offs and some are a little bit covert, but they're remakes of already existing stories and folklore either way, just like this is a remake. That said, I can excuse the original animations because they are exactly that: animations. With animations you can create styles and visuals that just won't work with CGI. Which is why Beauty and the Beast had a terrible visual style and which is why this movie will have a terrible visual style. Disney is gimping themselves artistically by remaking their old animations. You can't successfully recreate an expressive and vibrant animated character like the Beast because when it's live action, everything has to be firmly rooted in looking realistic, otherwise the actors look out of place, since you obviously can't change the visual style of a person's face. This is the same reason you can't successfully recreate an expressive and vibrant animated character like Abu, like Iago, like the carpet, like Genie.",1,0,aypierre,9g5knnlF7Zo,0.055515151515151524,2018-10-20 09:56:04,True,True

But seriously even though this looks well produced, Hollywood is really losing its charm with their risk aversion on major pictures. I swear I *have* to go to art house theaters to see any good original films that haven't gone through a bazillion focus groups and marketing teams. Plus I'm not even going to get started on how Disney has transformed from an animation and theme park company to a giant monopolistic squid monster across the entertainment industry. Movies these days can cost north of $25 to go see when you factor in concession prices, and would I pay those premium prices to see a well made but formulaic reboot? Absolutely not. My childhood isn't ruined in any way by a movie like this (that's just silly to say), but just like after chewing gum for a really long time these live action remakes are bland and rigid.

SCARLET JOHANSON AS KAA!!!!! (but it's a super small role with a minute or two of screen time  so stay quiet.) yet idris elba got little to no marketing and he is clearly the superior actor.   stop remaking your childhood and make a new one for the next generation you obsessive nostalgia driven retards.  give me something new to eat.  and stop letting will smith command screen time. i saw suicide squad and it was lame. he gets to pull his face and stare at people and he gets paid for it. the only time will smith is acting now, is when he pretends jaden isn't a complete fucking tool.  i admit, the movie looks nice. i like the cave already, the open mouth is quite surreal. don't change the songs, don't edit for the emotional cunts who complain about sensetivity issues or racism. make a new, exciting, engaging movie instead of forcing the adults who grew up with these amazing movies to watch it with their kids and be upset it wasn't as magical, amazing or full of wonder. i promise this film has already gone tits up. the only reason i watched jungle book is cos christopher walken was king louie and his speech pattern is hilariously scary. baloo being voiced by bill murrey was a no brainer. but the movie.... took something away from the original story. i can't put my finger on it but the original is somehow more intriguing and painstakingly made to be enjoyed for a short time.",0,0,swanclipper,9g5knnlF7Zo,0.1784902597402597,2018-10-21 14:47:06,True,True

But even though I saw the cartoon version when I was a kid, I decided NO I never want this in theaters next year because I dislike the cartoon version of Aladdin and this live action remake coming next year! I find some funny things about the live action Aladdin teaser, One is because it looks slighty like new  Bollywood movies with the desert landscapes and the city at night or day. Also the cave of wonders is part of a mountain instead of a dune and closes its mouth when someone enters. At the end of the teaser I'm watching right now, oh JESUS it was Aladdin discovering the magic lamp which contains the genie! I don't know who that person is playing Aladdin and I know Will Smith will be in this movie playing the genie plus I saw a movie starring Will Smith this year. Hey you know what the end of the trailer would have said ""In Loving Memory Of Robin Williams"" since he played the genie in the cartoon, because it was just a though but I'm not into him anymore after his death. Well I'm still not seeing this in theaters but Congratulations to Will Smith! Alright anyone who sees this comment and knows me please respect my opinion!",0,0,Shakti Rai,9g5knnlF7Zo,0.22560876623376624,2018-10-26 20:05:49,True,True

Also do you guys seriously think that these copy‚Äôs are any good? Like To Story 4 come on that‚Äôs a joke and this?

2019-01-14T03:11:21,"The film has drawn criticism for its decision to add a new original white character by casting actor Billy Magnussen as Prince Anders which fans and critics deemed ""unnecessary"" and ""offensive"", sparking accusations of whitewashing to the film while pointing out the irony regarding the worldwide search for actors and actresses to play the leads in connection to the controversy.[46][47][48] The decision to hire non-Arab, non-Middle Eastern and half-white Anglo Indian actress Naomi Scott to play the lead female Princess Jasmine has also drawn criticism as well as accusations of colorism, although certain members of the cast, particularly Negahban and Pedrad, are of Iranian descent while Acar is of Turkish descent.[49] In December 2018, Julie Ann Crommett, Disney's Vice President of Multicultural Engagement, said the decision to cast Scott as Jasmine reflected a mixing or association of different cultures in a broad region that consists of the Middle East, South Asia and China by extension, which all make up the Silk Road.[50] The real intention for Agrabah was for it to be the center of the Silk Road and added that Jasmine's mother would be from a land that was not Agrabah.[50]  In January 2018, it was reported that the white extras were being applied brown make-up during filming in order to ""blend in"", which caused an outcry and condemnation among fans and critics, branding the practice as ""an insult to the whole industry"" while accusing the producers of not recruiting people with Middle-Eastern or North African heritage. Disney responded to the controversy, saying, ""Diversity of our cast and background performers was a requirement and only in a handful of instances when it was a matter of specialty skills, safety and control (special effects rigs, stunt performers and handling of animals) were crew made up to blend in.""",3,0,Kenneth Monfil,9g5knnlF7Zo,0.07129169849758085,2019-01-14 03:11:21,True,True

Because I guarantee if they were live action when they initially released they wouldn't have had NEARLY the same impact as they did on all of us.

Chilling out, maxin' relaxin' all blue  And all snoozing in this cave full o'treasure and jewels  When this guy and his monkey they were up to no good  Started stealin bread and money in the neighborhood  I granted one little wish and they got greedy  They said ""You're moving with Apu and Aladdin in their city.""  I begged and pleaded for 10000 days  Then he rubbed my lamp and sent me on my way  before he said it looked like a worthless piece of junk  I got back in my lamp and thought ""I might aswell get drunk""   Carpet class, yo, this is bad  no orange juice in champagne glass? kinda sad  Is this what the people of Agrabah living like?   I just hope this isn't Fortnite  But wait, I hear they're pushy, barbaric, and all that  Is this the type of place they should sent this blue cat?   I don't think so, I'll see when I get there  I hope they're prepared for the Babba of Agrabah  Well, uh, the carpet landed and when I looked around  there was a dude looked like a robber with his eyes on the lamp on the ground  I ain't trying to get stolen yet, I just got here  I sprang in my lamp with quickness like lightning, disappeared  Aladdin whistled for the carpet and when it came near  The stitching said ""Fresh"" and it had dice as the tassels  if anything that journey is good for my cheek muscles  But I thought ""Nah, forget Degobah, let's to Agrabah""  I pulled up to a ruin about seven or eight  And I yelled to the carpi ""Yo holmes, smell you later""  Looked at my Reveal Trailer and it was finally clear  I have to get back to my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air",0,0,Basti Scholz,9g5knnlF7Zo,-0.06491545893719806,2019-02-15 10:04:04,True,True

2019-05-30T10:16:25,"I do not understand how middle easterns can support the live action of Aladdin without seeing the misrepresentation. First of all Naomi Scott should have never been casted as Jasmine because of her origin. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I think Naomi Scott is an amazing actress, the only problem is that she is Indian not Arabian and therefore does not share the same culture. I believe  that Jasmines costume and accessories were inspired by Indian clothing and ottoman clothing and therefore the Arabian culture was diminished. Secondly the dance scene with Aladdin and Jasmine was not right. They put Arabian belly dancing music in the background but their choreography looked more Indian and western (breakdancing) then Arabian. Thirdly one of the last scenes of the movie was so unrealistic for the culture that the movie was supposed to be representing. If that scene happened in real life, the Arabian society would frown upon it and would have never accepted it. It is sad to see that a movie that was suppose to represent middle eastern people actually ended up being more Indian and western. Especially since there are not a lot of movies that actually is based on our culture and those that exist are severely stereotypical. I think @disney made a sloppy job by casting and creating this movie, and did not put as much effort into actually represent the people the original movie was based on (look for example at Mulan casting job and their thorough search for all Chinese cast). I as a middle eastern girl do not feel represented enough and I am disappointed by the lack of outspoken critique from our supposed middle eastern idols of this modern age.",0,0,mandus116,9g5knnlF7Zo,-0.007298828622358032,2019-05-30 10:16:25,False,True
