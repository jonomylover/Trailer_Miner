Also, some parts made me tearful with emotion, and the characters were voiced by an all-star cast. Tip's hair was beautiful! The things I didn't like so much: I felt like some of the plot points were predictable; some of the insights felt cliched and trite; it also felt like they were trying to fit as many Rihanna songs into this movie as they could, which to me felt a bit forced.

They should just be thankful to be asked to be part of the movie. I know I will watch it until the day I die. That's how much I loved it. If you want to see a sort a sequel to this story, I hear they may continue the story but in comics. Not the same thing but it's cheaper for them. Those cheap bastards.

2016-02-21T10:07:11,"I gotta say the trailer for this blew me away, and I want to talk about one joke in particular  See, the main character, Sheldon Cooper,is not from Earth. He's from an alien planet, so he doesn't understand things that happen on Earth and human design. So there's one bit where Sheldon Cooper is on Earth with Rihanna and they're in a car that Rihanna can drive and while in the car they stop at a gas stop on go into the toilet in the gas stop on Earth. And Sheldon Cooper is talking to Rihanna through the wall of the bathroom because they're in different bathrooms in the toilets in the gas stop on Earth and Sheldon Cooper says to Rihanna he says ""They have bowls of lemonade here!"". Now that is the set up for the joke I am talking about, the line ""They have bowls of lemonade"" is part one of a two part joke the second part of which comes immediately after. See just after Sheldon Cooper talks about the bowls of lemonade to Rihanna he attempts to drink the lemonade at which point he exclaims through the wall of the toilet of the gas stop on Earth to Rihanna that ""the yellow liquid is not lemonade!"" and that is part two of the joke and is the punchline and the payoff for part one of the joke that I mentioned earlier.  The joke is that aliens shouldn't know what lemonade is so the fact that Sheldon Cooper knows about lemonade is mysterious and hilarious.",17,1,Devo Fauzan Rahman,iLGDJkhYnVc,0.04305555555555555,2016-02-21 10:07:11,False,False
