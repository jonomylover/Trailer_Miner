2017-03-31T21:59:31,"You folk here should be ashamed of yourselves.  Think of someone like Emma Watson. All she has known is a life of patriarcal oppression. When Emma was born in 1990, Margaret Thatcher was PM, Elizabeth II was the Queen. Julia Roberts was the highest grossing actor/actress. Driving Miss Daisy won best picture. Bette Midler won the grammy for song of the year, Ms Bonnie Raitt won grammy for album of the year. Daddy by Danielle Steele was the highest selling novel followed by The Plains of Passage by ms Jean m Auel shortly after. 3 of the top 4 all time best selling authors were women at this stage. Martha Stewart was worth approx $600m just signing with Time Publishing (would go on to be a billionare before Emma would start kindergarden) Roseanne was the biggest show in the USA and and in Emmas UK, it was 'Keeping Up Appearances' starring lead actress Dame Katherine Patricia Routledge.  Growing up, Emmas parents were both lawyers yet it was Emmas mother who won full custody of her kids. Emma would study at Oxford which had 40% boys to 60% girls. Emma would go on to audition for Harry Potter. The casting directors were Janet Hirshenson, Jane Jenkins, Susie Figgis & Karen Lindasy-Stewart, all women. She would be cast as Hermione and would earn $50m from Harry Potter films by age 21, equal to that of other co-start Rupert Grint. The author of Harry Potter (a 'ms', J.K Rowling) would become a billionare.   Take some time to think of the view of the world from Emma.
