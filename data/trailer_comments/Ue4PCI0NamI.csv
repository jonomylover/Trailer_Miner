This trailer has laid those fears to rest. Aside from the sign he used to contact Nasa, I could look at every scene in this trailer and tell you where it happened in the book.

While winds could get up to 400 km/h (250 mph), the pressure at sea level on mars is 600 pascals (.087 psi) and the pressure at sea level at earth is 101.3 kilopascals (14.69 psi). To give an earth equivalent, the effective wind speed would be a light 2.36 km/h (1.475) on Earth. This is definitely not enough to throw rocks around, as shown in the trailer. The only possible danger would be dust kicked up by the storm destroying equipment, but we have pretty thoroughly solved that sort of problem, as demonstrated by our incredibly long lasting rovers.

Was it so hard to make a simple trailer with Matt being just stuck on MARS and trying to figure out a way to survive? Was it really necessary to reveal all this stuff?  How are we suppose to feel any tension and excitement when actually watching the full movie when we already know so much about how it?  I mean... If this was like the third trailer, at least I could tell myself (Ok, already watched the teaser and first trailer. I don't need to watch more and risk being spoiled).  But this is THE FIRST TRAILER! It's not even a teaser... It's a TRAILER!  This isn't as bad as the latest terminator trailers, but still... They should find a guy who understands that trailers are not supposed to give away major spoilers and stick with him when it comes to making trailers.  The only way the movie can surprise me at this point is if Matt ends up building his own freaking spaceship to get off mars or that aliens come and save him... which are both unlikely.

2015-06-10T16:14:47,"EDIT!! [Jun. 19] Reading only the first part of this post may communicate (sometimes very strongly) something other than what I'm saying. So please, set aside responding to felt offense until after having read (not skim) the whole thing. Thank you. <><><><>  I'm a Psychology major, having taken multiple classes in psychology, participated in labs, interact with my professors, and overall study the science. As such, I can tell you:  --- If there is anything that science has shown us, it is that `helping others` is NOT a base instinct. What IS our base instinct is `wanting to be right` and `wanting to be liked`.  Sometimes this manifests as helping others in danger. Sometimes this manifests as punching that jerk in the face. And retaliating to being hurt by hurting back is much, MUCH more common, and more immediate a desire; it is instinctual.  We want to believe that we're good on an instinctual level, but this can only be believed in blind faith. We don't even need psychology to prove the opposite. Our every experience of wanting to respond to being hurt by hurting back proves that our instincts will destroy us.  We all know this. However, we want to deny it.  For some people, the message behind this movie will make it easier to believe that we are ""mostly good"". However, that will ensnare some people, making it harder for them to break the addiction to thinking themselves ""mostly good"", which leads to confusion and mental suffering. I am intimately aware of this in my own past and in the lives of many others.  Let's help one another! Let's try to save people in danger, and heal people who are hurting. Let us fight our natural instinct -- which is `hurting back` -- and instead forgive each other. We don't need this blind faith in ourselves in order to do good. That's a cop-out, and can trap hurting people where they are, keeping them from seeking out the help that they need.  What we need to do, is choose to love.  And when it gets too hard to love, let your weakness prove your need for strength from outside yourself, and go seek it out.  ""Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."" -- Jesus, in Matthew 11:28-30",2,10,Kellen Smith,Ue4PCI0NamI,0.131451367781155,2015-06-10 16:14:47,True,True

Secondly, Matt Damon isn't a bad actor but he is heavily overrated. I haven't really enjoyed him in a film since ""True Grit"" (2010). That's five years ago. Thirdly, I felt as though ""Interstellar"" was kind of a let down. Perhaps my expectations were far too high because of Christopher Nolan but I just didn't imagine I would walk away from that film giving it a B- rather than an A+.

You are in Mars all alone and I mean.. psychologically,  Mark Watney did not suffer anything.  One rage was enough for him. I think it makes him a robot.. Everything was great but I was expecting more of suspense and thrill that you could see in Christopher Nolan movies. But this was like.. so light. Remember Cast Away?  wow..  comparing to that, this guy Mark Watney must be a robot. This fact ruined the whole movie for me.. All the feelings that we could have felt with Mark Watney was just gone with some lame disco musics. It was not comedy and it certainly was not suspense movie  ( like interstellar ). And really..really bad choice of background music... Well..

Total BS. If this type of isolated flight was possible the men who were getting laid and those who were not would be at each others throats and one or all the women would have been pregnant.
