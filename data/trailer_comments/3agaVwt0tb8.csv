With is one reason why when people are older they forget stuff. So saying it be immortality isn't true. You would eventually become either a mindless husk or get an entire new personality with no memory of your past life. Also Immortality means eternal life. He can still die so that's also false. Lastly I'm i the only one who thinks this should have been a dark/comedy movie maybe some sadness in it. Story could have easily been a comedy such as instead of getting the body he did he got some chicks body.

2019-02-12T10:04:23,I was very impressed with Reynolds in this one he basically played three guys in one and absolutely killed it. I’ve seen some hate online but I don’t get it at all first off it was a awesome plot written great casted even better and the fight scenes were really good. All in all this is a really good movie in my opinion the ending twist gives you a lot of emotion and I think Reynolds should have got some type of award for this one.,0,0,TMT 1,3agaVwt0tb8,0.4388888888888889,2019-02-12 10:04:23,False,False
