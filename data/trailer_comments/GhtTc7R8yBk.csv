However, there comes a point in recovery when it's not about them, though, and more about wanting to help & inspire others who may be struggling with the same thing. The story and themes may be cliche, but they're cliche for a reason: Life is often a repeated series of mistakes and redemption.",1122,32,PLAYER1,GhtTc7R8yBk,0.26,2020-02-03 22:30:20,True,True

2020-03-02T15:24:22,"*I went to this highschool 40 years ago! Oh my! lol!*  I remember Principle Affair! His first name was Jon so I called him Billy just to mess with him.   Such as nice guy too. He let me skipped first period class to smoke some green with him and talk about alien and whether or not they had armpit hair.   Too bad with his home life tho. :( It sucked really. His mother was heavily sick. And his grandmother had stage 5 AIDS.  He always liked children but never had kids with his own. So one day I invited his wife over at school and had rough s-ex with her in the hallway. That lady was a screamer.   Anyways what I was trying to do was that I was giving him and his wife a baby. Don't judge me. I was a teen with teen logic. I was dumb. I thought I was helping him. :(  When his wife got pregnant, it turns out Jon wasn't happy. He confronted me about and I told him that she had s-ex with Timmy from third period.  Timmy died the next day due to a mysterious fall.   The cops couldn't find a suspect. I don't even know who done it.  The next day, I attended Timmy's funeral at the local church. I saw Timmy's mom crying a lot.  I wanted to have s-ex with Timmy's mom to give her a new Timmy (teen logic again) but I didn't because I wanted to smoke green with Principle Affair instead.  When me and Principle Affair left the church to smoke on the steps in front of the church, I said ""hi"" to his wife sitting in the church.   She didn't say hi back.  On the steps, I smoked. Principle Affair didn't take one hit. He just couldn't smoke. He was staring off into the sunset.  I wanted to ask him what's wrong but I thought it would be best unasked.   I kept looking at him. And he kept looking into the sunset. The joint that he was holding in his hand was evaporating. It was like someone else was smoking it for him.  I got up and told him: ""I see you at school tomorrow."" He said ""yeah"" and I said ""yeah"". And left.   My mom took me to McDonald's that night btw.  The next morning at school, Principle Affair didn't show up. He just vanished. We had to get a new Principle.  To this day, no one knows what happened to Principle Affair. His wife reported his missing but nothing came up.  Some say he went insane. Some say he was murdered. I say...he's out there...smoking green.",1,1,White Emerald_,GhtTc7R8yBk,-0.013005490444514836,2020-03-02 15:24:22,False,True
