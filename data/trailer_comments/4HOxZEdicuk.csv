2019-09-18T07:29:34,"Honestly yes, i won't even give a try to this movie only cause i have a huge dislike of Amy Schumer .... the concept of the movie is great, confidence is what makes a woman beautiful and insecurity is what makes her ugly, absolutely nothing else, height weight color or shape don't define how beautiful a woman is. Confidence, of course mixed with kindness and   modesty is what defines your beauty. But for a movie with such beautiful message they shouldn't have cast a woman who is hated by 85% of the population,  not hated for her looks but for her character!",0,0,karena apus,4HOxZEdicuk,0.2653846153846154,2019-09-18 07:29:34,False,False
