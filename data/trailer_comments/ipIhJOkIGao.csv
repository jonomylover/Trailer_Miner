The movie is very sloppy, too many sub plots, the plot is over complicated, but the Kevin Costner story with him having his memories changed is SOOO Good. I have a Video review on my channel that I go into more depth in. Overall though I would say this isn't a good movie but it does have an amazing story in it about a murderer who gets a memory transfer so all of the sudden he starts caring about some people in society.
