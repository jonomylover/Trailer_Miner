2015-07-29T17:23:08,"As a Catholic man I am very disgusted by what some priests have done, but people should realize that not all Catholic Churches are like this. The rules are much more strict when it comes to priests joining churches. In 2007, the Associated Press reported that sex abuse was very active in public schools, but that was not reported in many other sources. The monsignor at my family's church committed a crime like this and after he was dismissed from the clergy, the church and school became a better place. I still believe in God and go to mass every Sunday. I have made lifelong friends from going to church every Sunday and so have my parents. My siblings are also still close friends with people who went to Catholic elementary and high schools. I only went to see 'Doubt' back in 2008 because Amy Adams became ""America's Sweetheart"" after 'Enchanted' and I wanted to see her in another one of her finest performances.

Because there is people who is not afraid of admitting the errors of the Church, and priests are NOT all so. I know some priests that are Really caring people, who even approved things like this (the movie, not the pedophilies)  But also, maybe the movie could exaggerate a bit the events? I am saying this because when there is a movie based on true events, usually they also change some of those events.  Like in ""Imitation Game"", or ""Foxcatcher"", where true and dramatic events were told very well, but also with some artistic license.  I don't want this movie to exaggerate, and maybe show the priests who did this horrible sin like ogres or bad guys in a movie style. Of course, I am not defending their actions, I am happy they discovered them, but to exaggerate everything is never a good idea.  Mark Ruffalo himself said in an interview that he likes how Pope Francsis is dealing with the Church's problems, and that he hopes this movie will reach him and make him reflect a bit more on these actions.

I felt going in that the serious nature of the affair and the horror it cause would be fucked up by bad directors and inferior actors. Not the case. I only saw 2 problems. 1 was the actors getting too excited over¬† every¬†phone call before they answered it.. They could have been getting calls from the local tailor telling them their suit is ready. They could have answered the phone a bit more casually at times. The other problem is that they didn't have enough actors playing the roll of the accused priests. They should have found a few more actors who could play those slimy rolls. They should have found someone to play the former mayor of Boston Ray Flynn. He was a Catholic zealot who tried to intimidate one of the victims.

It was never required within the Judeo priesthood, nor among the primitive church.  It got tacked on along the way for a mixture of reasons, one of which was to keep localized clergy from becoming too powerful and establishing large formidable families and dynasties.  It was the Vatican's way (in collusion with certain royals) of keeping the priesthood under their thumb.  And as a result of this, untold millions of children have been sexually abused throughout the 2nd millennium.  Studies have shown that anywhere from 4 to 6% of all Roman Catholic clergy end up sexually abusing children.  And its geographical expression is ubiquitous. Wherever you find the Roman Catholic Church, you find 6% of its clergy abusing children.  There is very little geographic variation in the statistics.

Do you really think he said ""You should abuse children, it is the right thing to do"". Let me tell you one thing. He didn't. So the fault of this insane thing is in the priests who do this (and the ones who help them). And is not a majority. Is not! Yes, it happens a lot (and the movie shows it really well) but not all the priests do this. The ones who do are disgusting monsters and should spend the rest of their lifes in prision.
