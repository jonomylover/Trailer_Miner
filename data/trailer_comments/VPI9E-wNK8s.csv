This really feels like a sequel to Predator 2. Jungle to City to Suburbs. It's perfect. I'm just glad Shane Black is having fun with this. I miss the more lighthearted sequels that don't try to remove the corn factor and just go with with the pure nonsensical action. Now there are action movie franchises where you should take the story fairly seriously, but this isn't one of them. You just go to see these movies for blood, guts and explosions.

2018-05-11T01:18:03,"leaked script info proceed with caution Steve McKenna and his US special forces squad are in Cuba with orders to eliminate some drug lord and free the hostages. Suddenly an escape pod falls from the skies. The squad finds and unconscious Predator there and McKenna quickly expropriates helmet and weapon as evidence of an alien contact. They see a CIA chopper headin' to their location, McKenna runs away. Predator's up and kills USSF men then gets cought by CIA. McKenna mails the items to his storage cell right before gettin' cought as well. Because McKenna didn't pay for the storage the items are sent to the adress... where we meet his ex-wife and autistic son Robie. Of course little fella is a linguistic genius and bein' bullied at school. Casey (Munn's scientist character) is sent to a secret CIA base where Predator's held captive. While studying Predator's biology she learns that he was easily caught and that the base stores a lot of alien weaponry (from previous movies). Too late tho. - Meanwhile... McKenna is bein' transported to a madhouse with six other ex-soldiers via bus when guards are ordered to deliver him to the very same ""secret"" base for more questioning (what the hell?). They arrive just in time for the Predator's break out and McKenna uses the moment to escape. With the support of other prisoners he rescues Casey and they all make it to the chopper (""get to the chopper"" line drop). Meanwhile... Robie examines the items, ""hacks"" them and learn alien language. This starts a chain of events which resulted in another Predator comin' to Earth (he's called ""Upgrade"" in the script). He's three meters tall and looks more like humna than classic Predators. He needs an those items. - McKenna & co make it to his son just in time to save him from both Predators. When Upgrade and runaway Predator first meet face to face the tall one kills the other with one blow. - Upgrade is some kind of an intergalactic assassin. His task is to kill dissident Predatorsn who are hiding on Earth in Area 52 and work for the organization which protects it from aliens (umm... seriously?). Closer to the end our heroes find Upgrade's ""hidden"" ship in Florida (it was stolen from him by dissident Predator). Soon the ship's owner arives, releases a bunch of hybrids (three-legged Predators, spider Predators, etc) and they go to attack Area 52 (on foot... go figure). McKenna & co fly ahead and after a brief exposition get explained that there's urgent need to bring the rest of dissident Predators to the very same ship. From there they use cars for transportation (movie logic). What to expect: Robi puts on Predator's mask / shoulder canon and decides to walk the the streets in the midst of Halloween. He stumbles on school bullies, one of them throws an apple at him which Predator tech automatically perceive as an attack.. with corresponding consequences. Yes, it's a Halloween movie instead of Black's usual Christmas Eve. More Predator dogs. One of them gets an ""accidental lobotomy"", becomes friendly, helps the heroes and overall very cute (because we gotta sell toys). Obligatory ""Robie drivin' the alien ship"" scenes. Predator is forced to use a machine gun (AvP movie reference). Lots of references, line drops and easter eggs. Predators actually take spinal cord to collect human DNA and inject it into themselves in order to become stronger (because hunting trophies is sooo last century, right?) There's a Dutch cameo but the scene can be easy cut from the story and the character can be easily replaced with Glover's or Baldwin's characters from P2. this is going to be so bad",0,0,raggedcozy1,VPI9E-wNK8s,0.005259961127308067,2018-05-11 01:18:03,True,True

Dutch (arnie) is still alive, hes retired and hes haunted by what he has seen and is regarded as the old kook that lives alone by the forest's edge.  Everything changes however once a predator shows up again, this time out for Dutch personally since he managed to kill one of their kind and his skull (and spine) therefore makes for a highly regarded trophy. Having trouble to distinguish who Dutch actually is theese days, the predator goes on a killing spree in the small town, while also severing it entirely from the rest of the world communications wise.

We already know the idea behind the originals will be changed somehow, but how extreme it is we wont know for awhile. Heres two examples. TMNT. Long standing fanbase going back decades, each new addition brought something new and sure there were a few flops but all in all they stayed close and true to the original. And then Michael Bay got it and most of us can agree it made lot of fans unhappy. Then youve got Fast and Furious. Where the first few were about cars, some criminal activity, races and a bond of family. The last few were basically just action movies with cool cars and tech.

Do they all hunt for sport? Obviously not considering a lot of them must be at home developing all this weaponry and tech.    There is so much that could be done to raise the bar on this franchise, but instead of investing in a great story filmmakers just churn out the same piece of junk with different characters getting killed off with one of them making it to the end who survives.

Why do you think scar was sent to take out the predalien in AVP requiem?  It saw what happened to its Fallen Brother as a defilement that needed to be cleansed away. Total rubbish. Is this movie going to fit in with 2010s predators in any way shape or form? Are we going to hear back from  Royce or Isabel? Did  they survive the game preserve planet? Did they get back to Earth? And I'm aware of the comic book strip of what happened after the movie so I'm aware they stayed on the planet in the comics but that does not necessarily mean they will continue off that continuity. I would very much appreciate seeing those two characters back in this movie to the two together. Are we going to have any references or cameos of  Dutch or Danny Glover's character Harrigan from predator 2? The trailer didn't really do much for me, it did not have any sense of fear or dread and it looked  PG-13, isn't it supposed to be rated R?

Generic action set pieces we've seen before with predator pasted in. ~~~ Granted they're probably not showing the good stuff yet...

Not a real fan of you complain before you see it. Alot of the alien and predator films werent great but i enjoyed them all regardless how accurate or strong the story line is. After all its never been about the people or the plots with in. The first predator was hailed due to the fact it was new territory. Theyve been tracking it since. Hard to make a 30 year old idea seem valid or exciting with out extensive plot and casting changes. Glover in concrete jungle was rated terribly yet stand on its own to this day. A few i can hardly remember due to lack of story play and extensive dark scenery and cg making things hard to depict or sort out. Its looks like they decided to make a story again like the first 2 so i welcome it. With out it, ill forget it like avp and predators.

2018-05-13T23:58:19,"Looks awesome. I hate that everyone is against the fact that it's different from the original. The original was good but we already saw that movie, why watch it again? And if you do want to watch it again then just watch it again. It's not like anyone's stopping you. I personally think it looks cool. I like the idea of it being more action based too because we've gotten more scary movies from predator than action movies and when they did try to do action movies with it in that past it didn't work very great so I'm glad this one looks like it might do that right. Also, Jacob Trembley is always a win. I also see a lot of complaints about ""from the director of iron man 3"". Just because a director makes one movie that's meh doesn't mean they can't make something really good too. Just look at Stephen Spielberg, Tim Burton, and John Hughs. They've all made a lot of really good movies and a few poor ones too so whos to say that this director can't make up for Iron man 3. The movie might be really good, which I think it will be, or it might be really bad, or it might just be okay. Fact is if it's bad you can still watch the old one and if it's good then we can all enjoy it. So don't complain untill you see the movie.

Can't wait to see this one!! I think the idea of them genetically upgrading themselves is phenomenal! In my opinion, it adds more to the film, not just focusing on fear alone. Let's just hope this film won't receive so much hate because people are a little salty about wanting to keep the feeling of the original. I get wanting to go back to old times, I watch the first film as much as I can I adore it, but, I think the change in the movies is good! It's good to see these lethal hunters get smarter, and better over time. Many argue that the films are focusing more on the characters than the Predators. Now yes, they have done that, but it's supposed to pull you in, make you like the characters before they're quite possibly killed, giving you a good scare.

Arnold Schwarzenegger and John McTiernan launched the alien fighting franchise back in 1987, but what has followed failed to live up to the first installment. In an effort to revitalize the IP once more, Fox turned to writer/director Shane Black. Although he's best known for his work behind the camera, Black has major ties to the franchise already since he played Hawkins in Predator.  Black channeled his love for the franchise to create a reboot that still serves as a sequel to the events of the previous films. He assembled a great cast for his take too. Jacob Tremblay, Boyd Holbrook, Sterling K. Brown, Trevante Rhodes, Olivia Munn, and more are all set to appear, and we finally get to know what this movie is.

The CGI looks worse than it did in AVP, which is shocking.  They made fun of mental disorders throughout the ENTIRE movie. A few jokes of that sort are fine, and don't bother me, but they did it the ENTIRE film.  They tried too hard to be like the original, as well. Butchered lines from the original, tried to re-crate the ""rag tag"" band of soldiers, but horribly failed. I'd say the worst offender in this movie, by far, is how awful the effects were. I seriously don't think they were finished with them, but had to release the film. The blood has a weird 3D CGI look to it, both the human, and predator blood.
