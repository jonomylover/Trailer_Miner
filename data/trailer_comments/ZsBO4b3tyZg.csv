Sure there's blood, gore, and the characters can use big boy obscenities now but the tone and aesthetic still feels like a derivative of Del Toro's films. In fact if Del Toro had been able to make an R-rated Hellboy, it'd probably look and feel very similar to what's presented in this trailer. Granted this is still just a trailer, and still may be misrepresenting the actual film, but then again maybe not. That said I'm still hopeful, and I'm gonna watch this movie regardless.

I think the casting is good, but from this trailer, and the previous trailers, I'm worried that the tone of this movie totally missed what Hellboy is about. What I'm seeing here is a ""Venom""-isation of the Hellboy comic: taking the source content and adding lots of action and hoping a good movie will come out. For me, the Hellboy comics were always dark and bleak, had a sense of humour but also a melancholy, which I think Del Toro captured well - the melancholy of Hellboy being part of the disenchantment of the world, of, in killing various mythical beasts, making the world, in a way, drier and less rich. I'm not seeing this at all from the new trailers. Will probably watch this one when it comes to Amazon, but am curious about what the reviews say.",0,0,Anton Gourman,ZsBO4b3tyZg,0.0770021645021645,2019-03-01 13:18:43,True,True

2019-03-02T00:44:31,"'Smoke On The Water'? Okay, for all you children out there, Smoke On The Water is the predominant track on this trailer, it'll most-likely be played during the exciting moments in the movie, too. The track dates from 1972 - that's, like, really old people, you know? and it was written by a Rock band (that's Rock, not Heavy Metal) called 'Deep Purple'. You weren't even born when it was released, I know, but it's probably a better piece of music than the stuff you're currently listening to.   I saw the band Deep Purple, live, around 1973 in Glasgow, Scotland (I was a junior salesman in a popular music shop in the city), Deep Purple being my favourite band at the time. The following day after I'd seen the band - when they performed this track - I bought a used Fender Stratocaster guitar from the music store I worked in. This particular guitar was the same model as that used by Deep Purple's legendary guitarist - Richie Blackmore. I was aged 17 when I bought that guitar, I still own it and I still gig it today. I'm 62 now - that's how old this song is. It's a truly great song with a very catchy 4-note main riff - dah-dah-dah.. dah-dah-da-rah - and it's pretty well-known in old-person music circles.   Listen, if you'd like some sound musical advice, I would urge you to buy a Deep Purple CD, just to get a flavour of their fantastic creativity and musicality - it's *never* about just 1 song. What CD of theirs to buy? Oh, probably 'Best of' will give you a great selection of the popular work of this phenomenally talented group of musicians, but my personal favourites would be as follows: Deep Purple in Rock Fireball Machine Head.

2019-03-02T05:08:49,"Here's a balanced take, for those debating whether to see this movie or not:  - Those hardcore hating on this have major nostalgia for the original Hellboy movies, but objectively, their effects work does not look as clean as this movie just off the bat. - However, what does look starkly different is the missing trademark of Del Toro's monster making. That absence is especially felt after Hellboy II, which had some impressive practical effects that made the demons and monsters really come alive. The CGI of that time is hella noticeable though, and doesn't compare to what's presented here. - David Harbour seems to be going for a more go-lucky Hellboy than Perlman. I think that is down to taste. I personally do think Ron Perlman fit perfectly into the role, but I also think that Harbour is doing Hellboy justice as well, just in a different way. We'll have to see if his charisma will be able to carry this, because that I think is truly what made the first two so memorable. Perlman's portrayal.   I will watch this and judge afterwards.

I‚Äôll be here when it comes out and I guarantee you the majority of this film is bad cringe humor and fighting awful CGI lord of the rings monsters.

I do not say that based on Ron Pearlman as much as on the comic book version. Pearlman really captured the voice of Hellboy as I heard it while reading the book. This take by Harbour is a little silly but It could grow on me depending on how good the movie is. The  film makers keep saying the are ""sticking to the source material"" but this does not look like the creepy ""Victorian horror "" vibe I  get off the books. From this trailer it just seems more ""splatter""CG b-movie action horror , and that seems a little less sophisticated than the source material.

2019-03-02T21:28:21,"Love Hellboy. Loved both live action and animated films. Love the comics. Loved Perlman. Loved Harbour (from Stranger Things). This trailer looks great, but I won't see it.   I won't buy a ticket to this movie (for me or the five members of my family) or buy the blu-ray.  I'll probably borrow someone else's blu-ray or buy a used copy and watch it down the road.  And I'm not alone. There are millions more like me.   Why?  Because instead of just being entertainers, your lead actors (and writers, producers, directors, staff, etc.) feel the need to be political every available chance they can. They make it very clear that they have disdain for me and others that don't share their views.   To them, it's more important to scream about who they vote for (and against), and what their political views are (and why I'm an idiot for not sharing them) and alienate half their customer base, then it is to attract people to their movies.   Maybe the loss of customers like me is offset by new customers who are attracted to a film because the actor is an activist they support, but I kind of doubt it. I can't imagine a person who isn't interested in this kind of movie buying a ticket solely because Harbour wants to ""punch monsters (aka conservatives) in the face.""  But I could be wrong.   I hope one day, movie studios (and actors and video game studios and comic book companies and TV show producers etc) will remember what their actual business is: making entertaining products and trying to sell them to as many people as they can, so they can maximize profits for themselves and their investors.    I don't care to hear about your politics and your political views.    Just make an entertaining product, and I may give you my money.

2019-03-03T16:08:09,"This comment if for anyone trying to learn something about regret, if u do something and then regret it later on, I'll tell you that your not the same person you were, when you did the thing that you now regretted, it's like a fail-safe that God has implanted into your soul to always preserve your emotional and spiritual existence, if u regret something then your a totally different person now , just with memories of a time that u regret and memories can easily be wiped away clean, ask God he'll  show you just give it time. Also the body isn't made to last forever, people die  but their souls live on.  Ps. Your body is a physical thing ,When you think it's not a physical thing, your personality isn't a physical thing, your desires can manifest physically but they all come from your emotions and thats  you, your emotions are you, your emotions are your soul , your soul is you, so that means you live on forever,  easy way to look at it is your a soul controlling a body, you just need a body that can last forever. All this info came from God btw, he wants to hear from you,  he wants to explain  to you how he'll completely eradicate all your regrets so you live happily, go on ask him ,",0,0,daniel singh,ZsBO4b3tyZg,0.12920110192837464,2019-03-03 16:08:09,True,True

2019-03-04T00:56:11,"Precious one, Jesus Christ Creator and Sustainer! The Son is the radiance of God‚Äôs glory...sustaining all things by his powerful word. (Hebrews 1:3) In a beautiful New Testament passage found in the book of Hebrews, the writer eloquently praises Jesus for being the one through whom God created the heavens and the earth. Like the intricacy of a specialty watch, every detail of our universe was created by Jesus (Hebrews 1:2). From the vastness of the solar system to the uniqueness of our fingerprints, all things were made by Him.                                                             But more than the Creator, Jesus, like a clock‚Äôs mainspring, is essential for the function and flourishing of creation. His presence continually ‚Äú[sustains] all things by his powerful word‚Äù (v. 3), keeping all that He has created working together in all its amazing complexity.  As you have opportunity to experience the beauty of creation today, remember that ‚Äúin him all things hold together‚Äù (Colossians 1 : 17). What in God‚Äôs creation has caused you to worship Him? Why? As you ponder this very important question, look to the Lord and be saved. Acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Abba YHWH (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit!                                          Please take a moment to pray the following prayer with me....Dear Lord Jesus, thank You so much for the ways You care for and sustain Your creation. May we always recognize Your central role in both creating and sustaining the universe. May we have a joyful heart and a response of praise as we acknowledge Your ongoing provision for us. This and ALL things we pray in Your Mighty Mighty name, Amen!

2019-03-04T06:39:14,"I know that this is not a proper place to say this. But I really hope you read this because God changed my life! I was a very rude person. I was a strong skeptic. One thing is for sure, I never paid attention to God. I wanted to enjoy the pleasures of this world. I was sure that I was going to hell. I got drunk every week, parties, parties, luxuries, and more. But two years ago, I got so tired of this world. I never knew what love is. I thought that love was something physical and sensual. I thought I was almost gay myself. Suddenly I wanted to find the worship of Jesus Christ. While I was listening to it, God showed me that he was real. I was so shocked  I have lived my life full of sin and in emptiness. It is not eternal. They are like dust and have no life at all. You see, if we reject God, there is no meaning or life. Death is all they have. If we are not right with God, it's a thing that we should tremble before because there is judgment and hell. But God can restore anything. God sent his son Jesus Christ to die for our sins so that our relationship with him can be restored. Then, if we repent and believe him, we can be saved. We have to be forgiven by the name of Jesus with the waters and you will be born again. I was born again. Now my addictions have disappeared and I am living a new life. When I returned to God, I tasted the life and the light that I had never experienced before. I cried a lot when I asked him to forgive me because I knew he was a great sinner, but Jesus welcomed me with an open arm.  Because the wages of sin is death, while the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus, our Lord.  Thank you for reading. God really cares about you. He knows your pain. He is your refuge He can help you. Come to Jesus, throw away your sins!",0,0,Daniella Oh,ZsBO4b3tyZg,0.14414025974025976,2019-03-04 06:39:14,True,True

The problem, I think, with adapting Hellboy is that it's SUCH a comic: an amalgam of Kirbyesque action with a dude with a big-ass stone hand who smashes monsters, mixed with Lovecraft and Howard and world folklore and often slapstick humor. And there's this sort of nonchalant surrealness having this totally demonic-looking guy just walk into people's homes to investigate crazy paranormal shit and everyone, including himself, acting like he's a plumber come to figure out where a leak is coming from. And that's the whole point of the character. Yeah, he was brought to Earth from Hell and is destined to bring about the end of the world, but guess what? He doesn't give a shit. Far as he's concerned, he's just a regular guy doing what for him is a regular job. He makes his own decisions, lives his life one day at a time, and doesn‚Äôt sweat all the other stuff no matter how dark or apocalyptic or insane it might be. And in the comic books, it works.

WE WAIT SO FUCKING LONG FOR A HELLBOY MOVIE,  LIKE A CONTINUATION OF GUILLERMO DEL TORO'S WORLD,  WITH A HELLBOY 3. BECAUSE IN HELLBOY 2, HELLBOY GETS LIZ PREGNANT AND HIS CHILD IS THE PROPHECY TO KEEP THE WORLD IN BALANCE.  BECAUSE HELLBOY IS A DEVIL SPAWN AND LIZ IS A HUMAN.  WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE HELLBOY 3. AND RON PERLMAN IS THE ONE AND ONLY HELLBOY AND NO ONE IS REPLACING HIM,  TAKING HIS CROWN OR HIS THRONE.  RON, TORO,  AND FRANK MAGNOLA WANTED A HELLBOY 3. SO IDK WTF HAPPENED.  NOW,  NEXT THOUGHT: DAVID FROM STRANGER THINGS ISNT MY HELLBOY.  HIS MAKEUP AND APPEARANCE AND OUTFIT ARE ALL ON POINT,  BUT HIS VOICE IS HORRIBLE.  HE SOUNDS RETARDED OR AUTISTIC,  NO OFFENSE TO CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES.  BUT THIS IS NOT HOW HELLBOY IS SUPPOSED TO SOUND.  YOU CAN BARELY HEAR HIM AND BARELY UNDERSTAND HIM,  LIKE HES WEARING TOO MUCH MAKEUP AND HIS VOICE ISNT CLEAR.

That story was a culmination of the bigger history. It worked because of how it was intertwined with the 16-year-old history of Hellboy that preceded that story. You're shooting yourself in the foot, people who made this. Also, by the look of the film, it must've cost 90-100 million to make. Which was the budget Del Toro asked to finish his trilogy, but the studio thought it was too much. So then you reboot this franchise, but you spent the same amount of money the other guy was asking to finish his films, and you also made it R-rated?

2019-04-06T15:09:57,"""Hellboy 3"" looks great! I'm just gonna say it. I loved the first two that Guillermo Det Toro directed. They have a very special place in my heart. So I was a bit ""meh"" about a new movie on the horizon. But from this, and the final trailer - I'm freakin' pumped! I think I've even go to see it in theaters. And when it comes to ""reboots""in general the original movies still exists no matter how good or bad the new movie is. When it comes to this one though it still feels more like a continuation to me, and I think it has to do with the comics too, as they always are sort of episodic. Anyway, hopefully this is good and does well. If it does, perhaps it will be like a dark fantasy supernatural (less ""problematic"") ongoing James Bond series with soft reboots every couple of movies. That would be cool! Anyhow...

Even though this Movie LOOKS Bad, I‚Äôm getting really Tired of all the negative reviews and low Rotten Tomatoes Scores. Did I see a completely different Movie? Yes, I guess you could say that judging from my Review and everyone else‚Äôs Review. This Review is gonna be from a HUGE Long-time Hellboy Fan who knows and cares about the Character. Now albeit that Del Toro‚Äôs Version was more funner in terms of Character Design and Hellboy in that Movie looked more Handsomer in that Movie. Now, the Hellboy in this Movie looks kinda off mostly because he‚Äôs supposed to be a literal Demon from Hell and they took that turn a bit TOO Seriously. This might be the reason why this Movie is turning everyone off for some reason. Also, this Movie was such a Fun Bloody Good Time from Start to Finish. The Story that the Movie is based on is still to this day one of my Favorite Hellboy Stories And It truly shows the true nature and full strength of the Character. The Character Himself is supposed to be this sorta funny Character that has a few one-liners. And in this Movie, he‚Äôs taken very literally and the Actor himself said he had a fun time playing as this Character. And YES, I know that you all want the Old Actor Back because he‚Äôs MEANT to be Hellboy. But, that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt give other actors a chance to play this Character and the hate around this new actor is just so annoying. The other thing that I love mostly about this film is the Monsters and the Bloody Violence. Now, I‚Äôm mostly one for seeing a lot of Blood in Movies and I don‚Äôt mind if it takes an Edgy approach. ONLY, if it‚Äôs done right though, and this Movie is havin‚Äô Blood Splatter all over the place and it feels like I‚Äôm watching an Anime at times. And I‚Äôm also satisfied with the brutal glory kills that Hellboy delivers to everyone who is his enemy. That final act in particular was so fun and satisfying seeing Hellboy show off his full engaging Strength and why he‚Äôs so powerful. In the end, as a LONG-Time Hellboy Fan, this Movie was great and it was fun and entertaining. There are multiple scenes in this Movie where it is well-designed and well-directed. But don‚Äôt expect any Oscar-Winning Writing nor Oscar-Winning Voice Acting. Go out and see this Movie, if you Love Hellboy and if you think he‚Äôs one of the best Characters ever Created! I‚Äôm gonna give two Verdicts for this Movie: both as a Hellboy Fan and as a Movie Fan.  Verdict (from a Hellboy Fan‚Äôs Perspective): 8/10!  Verdict (from a Movie Fan‚Äôs Perspective): 7/10!",18,6,Micah/Dark Fantasy Writer,ZsBO4b3tyZg,0.11673380631713964,2019-04-14 22:46:13,False,True

It actually made me realize that when I watch gruesome deaths occur to a man... it's not that bad for me to handle emotionally. But I am impressed the director had zero fucks to give and did that shit to women in the film too. It made me feel really uneasy for sure to see that.   I liked that they showed you a glimpse of hell in it's horrible and agonizing glory. Definitely do not want anything to do with that!   The monsters were creepy for sure. More so towards the end of the film, but I feel like that's more of how it would actually be if such beings were present amongst us. Indiscriminate horrible slaughter and there would not be a damn thing anyone could do to stop it.   You didn't really get that vibe at all from the first two HellBoy films.
