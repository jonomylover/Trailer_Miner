Also, though not at all common in the aristocracy, there were quite a few people of ‚Äúexotic‚Äù origin in the courts of European monarchs, particularly as handmaids, and things of other things of that nature.

Perhaps this is because he would have been tempted to ask for the originals in Mary's handwriting.

The history between Mary and Elizabeth has so much story behind it that it is almost relevant to today's society (eg. the tensions between religion, and women position in power/parliament). The reason why Elizabeth and Mary hated each other (whether they wanted to or not) is because they threatened each other's position as Queens - because of religion and ability to produce heirs. Elizabeth was always threatened on the throne because the men in high positions did not like a woman in power and wanted to replace her with Mary. Also, it can also show a story of the unfortunate positions women have in power where they feel like they are always competing (who's better than the other?

2018-11-17T21:08:23,"To all who followed and replied my post here I would like to clarify some things. My post was supposed to be ironic because I know it does not match people's expectations and, in most cases,  it¬¥s beyond their knowledge. According to Miranda Kaufmann, the author of Black Tudors, there were black people present at the royal courts of Henry VII, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I and James I, and in the households of Sir Walter Raleigh and William Cecil.   I am no researcher but very interested in the subject. So far, I have not read anything that convinced me that there would have been black or asian NOBILITY in England or Scotland during this period of time with the influence of the regents. For my part, movies like this are my taste. Everyone knows that no movies are historically correct and can only be based on real people and events. Gemma Chan (the Asian woman) plays Bess of Hardwick, a person who has lived. Some people will never be correct to change ethnicity. I would never want to see a black man playing Hitler, nor a white man playing Nelson Mandela. I find it hard to believe any character in this movie destroys the experience of it. If it does, then maybe it's more about the viewer than the movie.",0,0,Martin Pettersson,T5l8cvuo7IA,0.038888888888888896,2018-11-17 21:08:23,True,True

Did you pirate it or something or go to the special screening? I mean what's wrong with a historical fiction movie? It's been done before. We're really not witnessing anything new. No history movie that's based in the medieval times are ever going to be completely historically accurate. That's damn near impossible. I mean if you ask me, the real only problems are Mary's accent and the scene with her and Elizabeth meeting which could very well be a dream sequence. Even if it isn't, the other trailer shows that Elizabeth says they're meeting in secret so at least they're addressing the known knowledge of them never meeting. As for the accent, this movie isn't the only portrayal of Mary that gave her the wrong accent. Elizabeth The Golden Age also gave her a Scottish accent and Reign gave her an English accent. Apparently Reign also gave the French English accents from what I heard so why attack this movie over the whole accent thing when it's not even what started it all? There was also another Elizabeth and Mary movie that had them meet. So again, why must this movie get so attacked? One thing this movie got right and other portrayals did not was that Mary actually has red hair while other portrayals like Adelaide Kane and Samantha Morton portrayed her with brown hair. I realize that's a very small detail compared to others but I'm just saying. Reign also portrayed Elizabeth as a much more evil queen then she really was. Again, I'm just saying that there are other history movies with inaccuracies so why must people make it like such a big thing when commenting on this movie?",0,0,Kee Leichtle,T5l8cvuo7IA,-0.04070374070374071,2018-11-20 06:49:02,True,True

Elizabeth I was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.  Henry's first wife was Catherine of Aragon, whose parents were King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain, who also controlled the vast majority of the Holy Roman Empire in Europe and who commissioned nearly all the great explorers of the time.  Hell, Christopher Columbus had already been to the New World and back a century before this film takes place and that was the last area of the globe to be discovered. Travel to Asia had been going on for several centuries prior.  And Africa was always most easily accessible continent by sea to the south of Europe. Northern Africans and Southern Europeans had been on one another's lands since water vessels were engineered by primitive humans.  Nobody is able to make the logical conclusion that during this late period of European expansion and exploration, that people came back along with goods? The slave trade didn't begin in the 1600s in the New World. It was WELL underway at this point in history. And not just slavery but interracial relationships as well as those seeking opportunities in a different part of the world.   And I don't remember anyone bitching about Morgan Freeman starring in Robin Hood back in 1991. And that film takes place 400 years before this one does.

An absolutely stunning movie that fascinates by its love for impressive acting, characters, costumes, setting, landscapes and the way of making use of symbolics and parallels to link the stories of our 2 majesties.  ___ With reference to the critics:  The free interpretation of the line between history and reality is called *artistic freedom*. (go look it up) It seems like this movie is way too conceived to interpret these ‚Äûmistakes‚Äú as ‚Äûcoincidences‚Äú. Believe me, they did their research and I suggest to think about what they actually wanted to achieve by changing the facts. Btw good for you that you know ‚Äûbetter‚Äú, so that you‚Äôre educating others, so that history is living up in our today‚Äôs conversations. (Besides they got 3,454,767,125 other facts right. Perhaps start acknowledging this first) In the end, it's just a movie.. ___ Go watch it and ‚Äûmake your own picture‚Äú (as we say in german)! It‚Äôs totally worth your time.

Declared herself queen of England purely on the basis of being Catholic (doing herself NO favours with Elizabeth even then), alienated her nobles, married a spoilt immature drunk, arranged his murder when she grew tired of him, acquitted the murderer then MARRIED him, was forced to abdicate by her exasperated nobles, escaped house arrest where she would have been comparatively safe, barged into England uninvited where she had little to no friends or supporters, to throw herself on Elizabeth's mercy; only to openly and in cold blood plot to assassinate her and usurp her throne (English spies read every one of her smuggled letters, by the end she had zero to say in her own defence save for ""I'm a queen, you can't touch me!"" and ""I'm a CATHOLIC MARTYR"") Elizabeth had no choice but to execute her, a decision that she AGONISED over, and still brought down the wrath of Spain upon her (Liz won that one too though.) Mary had not a tenth of Elizabeth's shrewdness, statecraft, foreign policy or common sense. All she  had going for her were beauty and charm, and they deserted her quickly enough.

Many of Queen Elizabeth's servants said she had a full head of red hair. So it really bothers me they try and make Mary the ""pretty"" one when although Elizabeth was ""swarthy"" she was said to be beautiful. Mary was raised to be a wife not a queen to rule. Scotland didn't even WANT her. She is the one who kept attempting to attack her cousin because she ""felt"" like Elizabeth didn't deserve the throne and the she had the backing of the Catholic Church.  This is just SO inaccurate I can't believe the actresses even agreed to the film. It's a joke.   I'm really fed up with all these stories creating Elizabeth as some villain when in reality she was a very sad and abused woman who never once got anything she desired. Her price to live and be queen was being sexually abused, giving up her one love, never knowing her mother, losing her father and all her siblings and yet it's still easier for movie writers to paint her a villain. Even though she may have been responsible for May's death she regretted that the most until the day she died. She was completely beside herself losing her but she really honestly had no other options! Mary clearly manipulated Elisabeth who needed a friend. Mary was never a good woman.

Another fun fact that displays the mentioned, queen Cathrine de medicis half brother was bi racial and had african mother, ( she was queen Marys ward).
