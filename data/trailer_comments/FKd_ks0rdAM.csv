They kidnap the driver and have a bunch of strippers over while he is decked out, when the fuck did the text his wife that, and why? It just doesn't make sense. Then he goes to find her a few days later, and she has a new dude already? So she is taking the moral high ground when she is already planning on leaving him and is already with someone else. I didn't know this was a marriage drama, thought this was a movie about cops trying to prevent thieves from taking stuff. They should have done his backstory way differently. Either show him actually cheating on his wife instead of him not doing it and it magically happens somehow and remove the other dude she was with when he went to find her. He doesn't serve any purpose for the story other than to make his wife look like a shit person.
