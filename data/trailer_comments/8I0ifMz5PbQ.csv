The best thing about the film is the sound effects of the waves in the theatre, and the first half when the disaster happened is quite dramatic, but the rescue attempt is extremely anti-climatic and Chris Pine honestly plays a very bland and uncharismatic character that you don't root for. They tried to squeeze in a romance in the film so there is emotional stakes for audience to feel attached to, but they spent so little time developing the relationship that it just didn't feel real and you don't care much about it.  The second half of the film, when tension is supposed to be the highest, just bored me, it all results in an ending that feels unfulfilling and unaccomplished.  The film doesn't have any major offence but it also doesn't do much to make itself stand out and be memorable after you walk out of the theatre.
