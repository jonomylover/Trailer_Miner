2016-10-09T18:32:46,"I would love to see a Resident Evil reboot similar to how the first Silent Hill movie was handled.  Follow the source material as closely as possible, utilize and take advantage of the source's settings and atmosphere, have slow but well paced tension for monsters (make them frightening challenges to the lead character(s), not just another easy obstacle in a linear path.), use same/similar soundtracks to the games, make it a legit survival horror film, *_then_* tweak it a bit to create a new experience to all audiences. Just like how they incorporated Silent Hill 1 and 2 into one movie, and had a non canon main lead who was not overbearing or overpowered the premise of the original source material that was utilized.  They should *only* stick to these video game sources for at least 2 consecutive movies:   Resident Evil, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Resident Evil: Code Veronica, Resident Evil Remake, Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil: Outbreak file 1 and 2.  These games could look like this in a movie format:  0.) { *May or may not be used.* } [Could set up as a two part movie with Remake.] Resident Evil 0  1.) Resident Evil Remake  2.) Resident Evil 2 and 3: Nemesis  3.) { *May or may not be used.* } [Spin off movie focusing on the experiences of average survivors during the Raccoon City Outbreak.] Resident Evil: Outbreak file 1 and 2  4.) { *May or may not be used* } Resident Evil: Code Veronica  Then the final movie of this saga should be a combination of Resident evil 4 and 5. The ending should be an ambiguous continuation of the series since Resident Evil as a whole lost it's identity during and after Resident Evil 5. But due to the plot of Resident Evil 5, you can end the ""movie series"" quite well. Just as long Albert Wesker is utilized as a reoccurring character across these movies.  Resident Evil 6 (fast paced and heavily action oriented.) was already like a mini series for a TV show or a movie by itself and 7 is entering a new era in the franchise.  Simple, easy, done.

No reference to whatever happened to Chris, Leon, Jill, Becky, Ada and K-Mart. Not one word is mentioned of them, leaving there fates unknown.  The serious retconning of previous films in the series making the characters of Angela and Dr Charles Ashford from RE: Apocalypse worthless. Charles created the T-Virus to help his daughter who had a genetic disease which made her walk with crutches. Now in Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, Dr James Marcus created the T-Virus to save his daughter Alicia from progeria. So did Charles and Angela not actually exist? Nothing is explained  Paul WS Anderson wrote all of the films (directed four of them) and it seems he got real lazy writing this one to the point he forgot what he had established in the previous films.

2017-02-05T01:17:27,"This movie was absolute garbage. Watch it with friends and get a good laugh out of it. It felt like the movie was on ritalin the whole time. The action scenes were filmed like a high speed power point, cutting to different as soon as they could, and whenever you aren't being subjected to these seizures (and they almost never stop) you have noisy zombies that pop out of thin air just in case you go three whole seconds without stimulation. And those zombies are always completely pointless, they never add anything to the story; in fact if anything, they serve to distract you from the fact that there IS no story. The plot is given to us in rushed, completely unnatural dialogue between characters who are clearly reading from an absolutely terrible script as fast as they can before anyone notices the plot holes before being thrown into another pointless battle scene. It comes down to this: the heroes need to go get the macguffin before....something happens and it's too late. It's never really explained WHY they're running out of time, the movie doesn't have time for little things like ""explanations"" or ""plot"". To make matters worse, we don't even get satisfying, gory, or even interesting action scenes for the most part. The best part of the whole film was when they fight a monster clearly meant to resemble a regenerator for 4 (though without regeneration powers) and even that barely lasted before the monster just decides to keel over. The final boss decides to rip off the sherlock holmes ""imagining a fight before it happens"" thing, which comes out of nowhere and becomes completely pointless.

The plot is such crap that by the end of it it doesn't even feel like the ""good ending"" is earned. It just feels like it was forced so that the movie will end. It's like the developers of this movie just gave up and didn't even try anymore. They just wanted it over with, and oh boy did I want it to be over with.

A-Virus was pretty unstable but it was able to cure T-Virus, sadly last person carrying it was killed as Umbrella noticed it as a threat to their plans. It was Ashfords daughter, killed by Alice (Project Alice).  2. Issacs had many clones, there was a ton of Umbrella facilities all over Globe, he could've also transfer his abilities onto clone, which, he didn't.  3. Wesker has accepted degradation because he knew that either way, he will be one of many that will stand in Light of new world, he had achieved what he wanted.  4. Why was Red Queen helping Alice/Why was she an Ally and why we didn't heard of Antivirus before?  Well, Anti-Virus was even more protected than any girls' virginity. Normal employees and even elite Umbrella scientists didn't had an knowledge of it existence and those who did, well, let's say their lives were short.
