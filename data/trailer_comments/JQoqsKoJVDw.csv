2016-08-15T09:14:34,"What follows is my contemplative review of this movie:  This is another face slap from Hollywood poking fun at gun carrying Texans, Native Americans, modern cowboys, Texas Rangers, serious long range hunting/target shooting, and the venerable but legal to own and enjoy as a semiautomatic rifle, the AR-15 and it's many civilian market variants and individual components and accessories from which we can legally buy and assemble them from.  I don't want to go into too much detail about the story line here.  So I'll just blast away at the technical errors in this film.  Firstly, the AR-15 is a semiautomatic rifle.  This film gives the impression to the typical movie goer that all AR-15s ""must be horrible fast firing automatic slaughter machines that can kill truck loads of people in seconds given enough high capacity magazines"".  The writer/director should have shown how the main character, a civilian ex-con, got his hands on a nonlegal fully automatic military M-16/M-4 or at least have depicted Eric or Loretta selling him the weapon from the back of a BATF pickup truck in the middle of a cow shit pasture.  Secondly, it is highly unlikely for a man in his mid to late 60s to fumble up a hill side totally out of breath, take a bolt action rifle that he is unfamiliar with in caliber, ammunition, scope focus, power, and zero, and simply place the crosshair on the target and nail it on the first try without even checking for crosswind, range distance, and line-of-sight inclination.  Complete Garbage.  Either the story writer is an ignorant jackass or Hollywood is actively brainwashing America into showing how easy it is for a armed person to kill.  I am afraid it is the latter.  Hollywood is at war with America in ways that not many can recognize.  Hollywood's greatest weapon in this modern ""Civil War"" is simple.  It's the ignorance and stupidity of the general public.  Their other weapons are peer pressure, racism, sexism, shame, and the Big Gun: Politics, personal, municipal, state wide, and national.  But fear not America.  Even if Hollywood wins millions of individual battles in the minds of you out there, it will lose the war like the Sodom and Gomorrah that it is.  God Bless America and God Bless our Constitution and Bill of Rights.  Don't see it.  It's stupid and aims to make fun of you by making you pay for the ticket.  At least that's how I feel about it.  Now I'm back to my reloading bench and target practice.  Don't worry.  Be Happy.  The Lord, ""Jesus Christ"", IS COMING BACK.

2017-01-15T14:57:33,"Hell or High Water is a critics favorite this year, and understandably so. This is a very well made movie from direction to cinematography, to dialogue and acting. The actors all around, from supporting to major characters add depth and substance to what could have been overly slow parts, but make it work. The movie belongs to Jeff Bridges as the soon to retire Texas Ranger. He brings that Bridges screen presence that makes it impossible to look away, and he's gone the extra mile for this character. If he does not get an Oscar nomination for this one, I'd be very surprised.   Many of the characters get overly close to wooden caricatures at times, but the actors, dialogue and director veer away from it just in time in most cases. A tad more character development wouldn't have hurt for the viewers connections to them, but what we do get, works well. The movie is a bit heavy handed and overly simplistic on the Robin Hood, Jesse James  theme and some misplaced blame on evil bank for all their problems, but that's understandable from the characters POV perhaps. The movie makes it seem everyone in that part of TX may not always have food, but they always have plenty of guns... Because this movie came from the same writer of Sicario I had very high hopes for Hell Or High Water, and while it didn't disappoint, it's no Sicario in my view.

Except he allies with his bad brother to achieve that greater good, doing greater wrong along the way. Except the bad brother is acting for the greater good, too. Except one man's greater good requires harming other's greater goods and lives. Except all of these people and their actions and their choices are their own, they are responsible for what they do and what they allow to be done in their name, as are all of us. Except we live in a world where forces larger than ourselves act upon us in obvious and secret ways every moment, and on every single one of our apparent choices, and on the outcomes of all of our choices, so much so that it's nearly impossible to truly have freedom to follow our own path without admitting that path is largely defined by forces larger than any one of us or many of us.",0,0,Doug Palandech,JQoqsKoJVDw,0.13173215673215674,2017-03-13 14:03:08,False,False
