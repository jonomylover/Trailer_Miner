He gets horrible grades and gets suspended  multiple times putting her in a emotional state his little sister is not at all like how she is in the movie she's a goody goody who gets good grades and likes to snitch and nobody helps him break the rules it's so stupid how they made this movie just please read the book and you'll thank me this movie is giving the book series a bad name,0,0,Bryce Walker,XHSZtQN6CXo,-0.18027935606060605,2016-09-08 23:24:15,True,True

2016-09-17T19:56:23,"Ugg. First of all, the principal is a lady. Next, he rarely talks to the principal. Also, he isn't trying to stand up to the school, he is just trying to enjoy life. Plus, he only has Leo as a friend. He never becomes friends with the bully, Jeannie only talks to him a bit. She never breaks the rules. Rafe is the only One who knows about operation RAFE. His sister, she never does anything like that, she is well behaved even though she is a tattle tale and talks a lot. He rarely sees his mom, he doesn't live in a nice house, I didn't see Bear in this trailer, the rules at the school aren't bad rules, they just are rules. No art? That's not a rule at all! Plus, Leo is way to skinny. He is supposed to be a chubby, silent blonde kid. Plus, it looked like people were interacting with Leo, he isn't there! He's imaginary!!! It's okay to change a few things, but this completely strips away the book that I read almost everyday to some silly hero movie.
