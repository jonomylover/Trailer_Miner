New stuff have the talent to be amazing or disastrous, but I'm betting on amazing, since I know the feeling of the cartoonish style from the earlier games, and I know that the ones who focused on this feeling know the true taste of a blizzard game, when the older roots gave stronger bonds, giving in to the value the fans gave to this sensation, they value that and are bold enough to show it on a high budget movie.

I've heard that the filmmakers did it that way because, in the games, players can choose which side they want to play as. So, when they watch the movie, they can sympathize with whichever side they play as. I, on the other hand, would probably watch the movie and hope that both sides can come to some kind of peaceful compromise.

Right at 0:03, when they show Stormwind, it looks GREAT because of how fast it goes. But if you pause the invididual frames, imo it looks like shit, especially when they show that group of people at the stairs. The green-screen effect is painfully obvious, and the CGI looks very CGI. If you pause at 0:04, it looks like complete shit if you compare the background to the actors.... Even their clothing looks CGI.  Still, I hope they adress this as time goes by and the movie actually comes out.

They get in war to survive because the real BAD guys are totally different parties. So you will see and know why they fight. This isn't a bullshit story where ONE MAN kills a whole empire, millions of bad guys and saves the world!  2. Something we haven't seen before! Duncan Jones (the director) said this is a mix of LotR and Avatar and they pushed technology to a whole new level just for this movie. You haven't seen a thing in this 15 seconds. I mean i'm not a real fan of Lotr nor Star Wars, but do you guys love those movies because of the graphics? If so, then you shouldn't be even allowed to go into theaters.  3. A hell of a ride! This is a PG-13 movie. Brutal. War. Not a fucking pillow fight! Blizzard directly was involved into the whole process of making this movie and trust me, they are very well aware how the people are going to react if they mess up the story. They know what people want.  A suggestion: before you throw hate, do some research about the movie and its story.

If the movie sucks, it will fail to gather more subscribers and it will even hinder WoW's remaining subs because no one is going to want to go around in public saying they play World of Warcraft anymore.

I don't want to do that!!!  The movie NEEDS to be epic!!!  I hope Blizzard actually got to see the whole movie and judge it for themselves!  If they judge that the movie is horrible, then they need to cancel that thing RIGHT NOW!!!    But you know what?  I'm confident this movie is gonna rock!  I have this gut feeling it's gonna be up to par with Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit!  It has to be!  That's what most non-WoW players are gonna compare to the movie!

This was around 1994-95, and I was around 9-10 year old. It was a cold dark night - around winter time - and I was watching the guy playing this game for hours, I was amazed by animation of the fire, by the dark pine forests, the sound effects of the arrows and the hammers while the buildings were under construction, by the voice of the characters ""yes my lord"", ""for the alliance"" ""job's done"", etc. The first two Warcraft games - and its expansions - had a dark, mystical, medieval feeling, you felt the cold steel in your hand, and so on, it was so exciting to explore the dark spots on the map, you did not know what to expect. And there were just a few races in these games, the resolution sucked - compared to the recent games - but it had such a great feeling and gameplay, you felt you were part of a different world, and you ruled this world.   I was a bit naive, but I hoped that if a Warcraft movie ever came out, it could give me this feeling like I felt back 20 years ago, when first met the game. But seeing this trailer, it rather focuses on the expectations of players of World of Warcraft.

I was just expecting more out of the cgi.  It just doesn't look believable.  It looks as though I will be going to the movies to see a very long WoW cinematic.  When the teaser opened up with the griffin.  i thought I was being trolled at first.  With a really good fan made movie.  As the second srolled by I could see.  Well all the cartoony cgi.  The orcs looks stunted and off.  As if they are not standing on that hill and their shortness looked as though I was looking at a bad technicolor panoramic.  It's hard to immerse ones self if I don't believe the backdrop isn't real.  The two guards standing their look as though their plated helms are so heavy that they are permenantly looking at the ground.  I am really keeping my hopes up for the Blizzcon official trailer.  I am really excited for the movie.  I just expected better out of the cgi.,0,0,Michael Lee,FA_8TY9Z5Zg,0.12468253968253967,2015-11-04 19:50:02,True,True

And this comes from someone whose been playing Blizzard titles as far back as Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. Personally I think this movie should be in full CGI like Beowulf. Blizzard makes awesome cinematics. Too many limitations on a live action film that can cause its downfall, especially with a fantasy genre. Another issue I have with live action film is the success relies on not only needing a good story, which writers will likely change and the ability of the actors. Some of the best actors have ruined movies that could've been good. Consider the Mists of Pandaria cinematic the human is ripped as fuck, hell the books reference Varian having enough strength to strangle someone one-handed. Live action film isn't going to be reflect what the physical appearance of Humans really look like in the Warcraft Universe.

In LOTR, you watch and it is incredible, the locations the friggen massive scale battles and your jaw drops. which this movie will have. The kicker is, in LOTR nobody is rooting for the orcs, accept maybe that one friend ya got who always goes against the group... This movie though, has two sympathetic stories... To the Alliance, the Horde are a bunch of bloodthirsty villains, When really the orcs are just being manipulated and used as pawns, and are really just escaping from their world which is breaking. so you are going to have two sides to the coin... i can see the stupid hashtags now... people are going to be routing for either side and its going to cause a lot of fun drama, and discussion after you see it, and any sequels they spawn will freaking annihilate because the story line only gets better...

2016-03-22T11:34:12,"First I Love World of Warcraft! However I really don't like that the movie is going to be a Live Action film. The reasons behind this are, the cost and time it takes to make it are far too much and far too long, where as if you had stuck to the Cinematic Animation (like the game trailers) the movie would have taken far less time and money. Next if the movie was in Cinematic fashion there wouldn't be any fears about an Actor getting injured or killed (accidents on set (Harrison Ford, Set of Star wars VII), drunk drivers (Paul Walker, Fast and the Furious 7)) or even just wanting more money to do the next film! (life and people are too unpredictable) Also If you had gone the Cinematic route you could have set it up to see the film from each Factions Point of View, for example 2 movies released at the same time one would show you everything that happens from the Point of View of The Alliance, and the other would show you everything that happens from the Point of View of The Horde! This would have been AMAZING!! Going that route would have not only made double the money because people would have wanted to see both films, it would have attracted old players back, and brought new players in because they would seen the history of World of Warcraft and had the DESIRE to play the game and be part of that World!........................................This is just my opinion!",0,0,Buddy Whited,FA_8TY9Z5Zg,0.035801373106060616,2016-03-22 11:34:12,True,True
