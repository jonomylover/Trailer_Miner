2015-11-10T12:41:08,"What I find amusing is that, when one whale named Mocha Dick (an albino sperm whale that inhabited the seas near the island of Mocha) out of the hundreds of thousands of whales that were killed managed to frequently elude, attacked and destroyed over a 100 whaling ships, evade and ultimately kill some of its wouldbe killers, the stories told by the surviving humans captured the attention and subsequently lead to its popularity in folklore. According to Jeremiah Renold's manuscript journal, Mocha Dick was killed in 1838 where he apparently came to the aid of distraught cow whose calf had been slain by whalers. Mocha Dick isnt the first albino sperm whale that we killed either. Three others were killed in 1859, 1902 and 1952.   We extracted oil from the heads of sperm whales called Spermaceti during the 18th and 19th century and used it as an energy source that nearly drove the whales into extinction. A single large sperm whale could hold as much as 3 tonnes of oil and we found many uses for this including heating, lubrication, soap, candle wax, ropes and industrial textile usage. It was only though the development of modest technological innovation that the whales were saved at the last minute. It is estimated that nearly 236,000 whales were killed in the 19th century alone.   However, it was only recently in 1986 that whaling was banned, however, since then, 30,000 whales have been killed despite bans on commercial whaling and trade in whale products, whaling is still carried out by Japan, Norway and Iceland  over 2000 are killed each year",0,0,scyther6666,K-H35Mpj4uk,0.003911564625850338,2015-11-10 12:41:08,True,True

2015-12-01T04:24:59,"The book by Nathaniel Philbrick about the tragedy of the whale ship Essex was a fantastic read. It wasn't so much about the sperm whale that demolished their ship, but about the fatal choices that Captain Pollard made in the aftermath that led to the gruesome demise of several crew men. They were lost in the vast ocean with very little supplies and had some options of going ashore to nearby islands. The men feared that these islands were inhabited by cannibals, so they made the fatal decision to go further out to a known port that under their current situation would spell disaster.   With very little water and food , the men grew desperate and resorted to the unthinkable. In a twist of iorny  the men became what they feared the most. I read this book years ago and I still remember the haunting imagery and sense of despair, one line in particular still sticks with me. Years later when one of the survivors was asked if he knew a certain shipmate, the man simply replied (not verbatim) ""knew him? ... well I ate him""",0,3,Oriana Z,K-H35Mpj4uk,-0.041034226190476183,2015-12-01 04:24:59,True,True

It is actually a much better film than its critics rated it and I would recommend watching this film. An interesting note, Peter Coffin was the first crewman to die and be cannibalised in the crew's desperate survival struggle. Melville would juxtapose the name Peter Coffin, as the Inn Keeper who provides Ishmael with a room, and upon his first meeting the cannibal Queequeg he cries out 'Coffin save me.' At the end of the book Moby Dick, it is drown Queequeg's coffin which provides Ishmael a raft that saves Ismael until he is found by the whaleship Rachel: 'who in her melancholy search for her lost children, found another orphan.'
