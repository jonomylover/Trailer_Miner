I think a lot of you guys are just joking around about that, I really do but for those who seriously thought that: What the hell? Trying reading an actual book with words in them: The Winchester House is well known to those who are ghost enthusiasts (you're looking at one.) It's said Sarah Winchester built the house (on the advice from her medium) to confuse the spirits of those killed by Winchester weapons so they couldn't get to her plus she was told that as long as continued building she wouldn't die.  She never stopped building until the day she died. It seems they've twisted that story quite a bit to make the movie. Intrigued as I am by it, I probably won't go: I don't do well with certain types of horror flicks. Case in point: at that last bit of the trailer, I not only jumped but screamed as well.

William was the creator of the Winchester riffle and many people were killed because of that riffle. When he died, his grieving wife Sarah claimed that all the souls, ghosts & demons of the victims killed by the Winchester riffle would haunt her because they blamed her husband for their deaths. There are 2 popular theories of what happened after;  -She didn't want the spirits to harm her so she ordered her construction workers to make crazy designs and trapping rooms in order to confuse the ghosts and protect herself.   -She claimed she was able to communicate with the spirits and they wanted to be satisfied. They wanted her to keep adding to the house and never stop. Of course in order to protect herself she followed orders and made her construction workers do the same.  Sarah later died of heart failure and the house is still to this day considered unfinished.  The house now is haunted and tourists visit everyday. Her death room is claimed to be the most haunted. People have said they've heard footsteps, seen some of her servants, heard nails being hammered, seen things in a mirror and there's a basement where people don't go in because when you do, its said you instantly feel cold and negative vibes.",0,0,xxoo,vseYaPR6hgI,0.023958333333333328,2017-10-25 04:21:21,True,True

She told me about my great, great (great?) grandmother/aunt (she just said relative) who was so crazy that she thought she had to keep adding to her house because she was convinced that the spirits who killed her husband would then kill her if she didn't. There was a lot of demonic oppression and possession in my mom's family that I didn't really think much of it at the time, but listened to her story.   A couple of years ago at college, I was telling one of my friends about our family history and how they're all crazy. I was trying to tell her as far back as I could so I started with my great, great grandmother, or aunt. As I was telling her about the house my friend exclaimed, ""wait! I've heard of that house!"" She then googled Winchester Mystery House, to which I was horrified, because my mom's mom's name was Donna Winchester...   I put two and two together.

Wow apparently they did not do good enough history or research like they were supposed to and that movie as Above So Below backfired like really. I think if they would have done a lot more research and did their history right on the catacombs in Paris. I think that as above so below could have been a fantastic Movie.

2018-02-20T22:38:58,"Like other upper-crust wealthy families in the late 1800s, Sarah was ""into"" spiritism, s√©ances, etc.¬† Apparently, a medium once told Sarah (daughter-in-law of the company founder, Oliver F. Winchester) that she would be haunted by the ghosts of all the people who died from Winchester firearms (and there were quite a few who did - Winchester is ""The Gun that Won the West"").¬† Her husband William Wirt (Oliver's son) was slated to succeed Oliver as President when Oliver died in 1880, but William died of TB the following year.¬† But, she was told that if she continued building her house, that would keep the spirits away.¬† She believed it, so she squandered millions of dollars (which was a lot of money in the timeframe 1880-1920) building her mansion.¬† A bit later, when the company fell on hard times, maybe those millions could have helped avoid bankruptcy (in 1931, followed by acquisition by Western Cartridge Company, and later inclusion as a ""Division of Olin Corporation"").¬† Winchester's financial problems started when they invested heavily in new production capacity to fill orders for World War-I (1914-18).¬† After the war, demand for new firearms decreased (especially with all the military surplus arms available).¬† They tried to diversify into other product lines, but their debt load eventually overwhelmed them and they went under in 1931.",0,0,KevinSchwinkendorf,vseYaPR6hgI,-0.01771885521885522,2018-02-20 22:38:58,False,True
