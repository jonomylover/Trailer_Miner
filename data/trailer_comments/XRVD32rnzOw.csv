I'll go for the cast, I'll go for the action, I'll go for the visuals, I'm sure I'll even enjoy myself..

A few weeks later he bought a brand new Mini cooper and got rid of a broken down VW.bug that was on the side of the road more than on the road,   So all this crap about how he worked for everything he has is BS.   He went from living behind Sears to a Plantation and at the time was a wealthy area.    They both did separate Tax returns because Brian made so little money, that he received a tax refund. The fact is, Brian hit the money load whether he knew it before or 6 weeks after being married as he stated is not relevant.   He mocks people that really work and makes it like he has everything because HE worked for it.. NOT true at all  That's why AL is banned from the show because he found out the truth and that why Brian wont take his calls.. But he tells everyone he not scared of any callers.

So I've had a few minutes to digest this; rather than anger, this trailer literally made me sad because I know for sure that no new Star Trek movie or show will ever again be made with Star Trek fans in mind. The first one was fun, but was more Star Wars than Star Trek. Into Darkness was just a mashing of previously used Star Trek ideas stuffed into remake wrapping paper and was less Star Wars and more Action Movie in Space.  I'm not afraid of change, or something new. Give me something new. But think of it like this:  What if Star Wars were made to into a dry, political drama in which Jedi were little more than diplomats being sent out on missions to settle trade route negotiations, characters with no personalities and muddled motivations were to take the place of a coherent story, and real sets and characters were to be replaced with sterile, green-screened recreations of the people and places they were meant to depict?

(I’m not comfortable  with that) 2 – Why ground the crew on a planet... to face different challenges and adventures?  (I’m still waiting for the regular adventures… “Space the final frontier” isn’t that the promise?) 3 – Who are those aliens?

He went from living behind Sears to a Plantation and at the time was a wealthy area.    They both did separate Tax returns because Brian made so little money, that he received a tax refund. The fact is, Brian hit the money load whether he knew it before or 6 weeks after being married as he stated is not relevant.   He mocks people that really work and makes it like he has everything because HE worked for it.. NOT true at all  That's why AL is banned from the show because he found out the truth and that why Brian wont take his calls.. But he tells everyone he not scared of any callers.

2015-12-14T20:39:17,"Judging from my guess of the plot and the handful of scenes shown, it's possible that this is the closest movie to a TOS episode we've ever seen.   It seems as if they're exploring deep space, encounter some kind of crazy swarm that attacks the ship, and the crew ends up forced to crash-land somewhere by this mystery swarm. They run into some other unknown aliens who have suffered the same fate and with no resources have to try and figure out the mystery. Through cooperation, diplomacy, and heroic action they eventually save the day despite limited resources. That's pretty damn TOS sounding. I wouldn't be surprised though if the aliens turned out to be maybe humans from the future in some kind of weird time travel plot twist or something. Too few details given to really tell.  The music and editing makes this seem like a modern day Guardians of the Galaxy type of popcorn action film, but given the trailer's presence in front of Star Wars I'm sure they're just hyping it up for a mainstream audience. That's not the type of trailer I really wanted to see, but given the financial realities here I get it. Hopefully in a month or two once Star Wars hype dies down a bit they'll have a second extended trailer that gives a better sense of the film.

TMP sucked, Search for Spock wasn't great, The Final Frontier was a joke, Insurrection bombed,  Nemesis seemed like a rushed way to send off the TNG crew, then TV Shows... DS9 was a little too preachy, Enterprise mucked things up and just as it was getting good it got killed unceremoniously.

They aren't going to drop a dime on anything that they don't think will make money and as much as it hurts fans to admit it, the Star Trek movies prior to this JJverse reboot/refit/remake/sequel series weren't money makers and were not well received by anyone other than Trek fans which in the eyes of the studio mean limited return on investment.   I watch the old stuff in the comfort of my home no problem and enjoy it, but I'll take these Action movies even if you could essentially replace the costumes and character names and end up with a Guardians of the Galaxy movie - which would still be awesome.  Take what you can get - or just go off and watch the Stupid looking remake of Ghostbusters with a crappy 80s Ectomobile, Stupid looking proton packs strapped onto the cast of Bridesmaid.  (Funny actresses who I do like, but I'm having a hell of a time seeing them as Ghostbusters)   Oh and if you don't like the JJverse, at least you can be satisfied that the enormously oversized Enterprise which dwarfed Galaxy class ships appears to be destroyed in this one.",0,0,Bryan,XRVD32rnzOw,0.037142857142857165,2015-12-14 20:59:20,True,True

2015-12-14T21:01:38,"Movies are meant to look good through trailers. If you want to create any hope of having people be interested in your movie, you need to make a trailer that at least seems somewhat appealing to the viewer. This trailer was horribly edited. I am a filmmaker and an editor myself, and I can easily tell you that whoever made this trailer knew nothing about what they were doing.   For one, the music. The music fits horribly for this trailer. It's not bad music, but it just doesn't help to set things up. Maybe for another one they could've done something with it. It's not necessary that they set the film up with a dark tone or something like that. The trailer should've been longer (two minutes, no less) and set up the film more.  Speaking of which, that's the second problem -  the trailer is so short. It sets up nothing about the film and only leaves the viewer confused - that's exactly how I feel right now. Granted, they shouldn't give away the entire film, like the Batman vs. Superman trailer did. But here they just didn't buff up the trailer enough. It's a complete hit and miss. And lastly, as of now, the movie just doesn't look good. The opening of the trailer could've been a buildup to something bigger, but the entire thing wound up being a bunch of random action shots that amounted to nothing. So that's why a third of the ratings are dislikes, because it is most certainly a horrible trailer.",1,0,LordStarscream100,XRVD32rnzOw,0.013412698412698409,2015-12-14 21:01:38,True,True

And as if we don't aleready have enough violence and conflicts on earth, we even need to make this franchise more violent with generic action and fighting. I saw a documentary featuring a guy from motorola saying that Star Trek inspired him to create the first mobile phone. A generic action based plot with an established IP  built around it won't accomplish something so awesome like that. And to anyone who says: Well Star Trek wasn't for everyone and now they wan't everyone to be able to enjoy it. Well then someone is doing his job wrong, I think it's possible to produce an interessting/intelligent movie most people enjoy!

OK so i bloody loves Star Trek way more than Star Wars (and believe my the Star Wars hype is real) but this trailer was so disgusting. I dont think any of the crew of this film have seen a single episode of original Trek.  Why do they have to blow the bloody Enterprise up every film dont they understand that the Enterprise is supposed to be as much of a character as Kirk not just some plot device to be blown up every 5 seconds, also the Enterprise is the Federation Flagship how can a bunch of asteroids disable it (apparently their is no such thing as navigational shields i mean what is the point of having a navigational deflector if it cant deflect...). Honestly i dont even think i will see this at the cinema and put all the money i save into Axanar as that ""Fan Film"" looks amazing and if you haven't seen it you should watch Prelude to Axanar. Leonard Nimoy would be turning in his grave at this, God bless him.   anyway rant over go watch Axanar  LLAP",0,0,Condor1994,XRVD32rnzOw,-0.0005952380952380858,2015-12-14 21:48:25,True,True

It looks a bit more like it's shooting for something along the lines of Insurrection or Star Trek V, in that we do get to see an alien civilization and some kind of revolt perhaps, though hopefully better executed than in those films. It looks lighter and a bit more problem-solving than villain-killing, so it looks promising. I'm cautiously optimistic that this might finally feel a bit more like TV Trek, but with movie Trek action and over-sized emotion.  I noticed Orci, McKay, and Payne are still listed as writers.  Perhaps there influence is still there, including Orci's wish that the film move away from villains.

That fits specifically with the original Star Trek show lol) BUT, if the whole movie is too action-y, which this trailer is making it look like, that would totally take away from the Star Trek feel. A good amount of action, sure, but it can't be like your usual summer action blockbuster lol And THEN we have Sabotage by Beastie Boys playing throughout the ENTIRE trailer! I love the song myself, but playing it for more than a bit in a Star Trek trailer takes away from the feel AGAIN. Ugh...let's hope this is all because the TRAILER was mad kinda badly for any sort of ""fan"" of Star Trek, and not the whole movie. Let's hope for it to be a marketing ploy, guys, come on!

This trailer, with the music choice (which might be why I feel this way), kind of makes me feel like I should put on some leather, grab a couple guns and get ready to kick some a$$. Not something I should feel when watching Star Trek. Especially since I avoid action movies due to the redundancy (unless it's marvel). I will reserve final judgment. There's a lot of trailers that show all the actiony parts in the trailer and the rest of the movie doesn't have that. So it's possible that this is one of those times. Also with lowered expectations, I might enjoy it more. But I went into Darkness (I know a lot of people hated that one) with high expectations, and I loved it so much, I got into TOS.  Til now I held the reboot and TOS separate  in my likes.

This one, like its two predecessors, seems to be another punishment of Ex$plo$ive Blockbu$ter $chlock.  Star Trek used to be defined by its interest in social reform, non-violent problem solving, and publicly approachable philosophy.    The Original Series had the first ever nationally televised interracial kiss, TNG challenged gender norms by having men wear mini dresses and by writing episodes with obvious LGBT parallels, Voyager made a point to include a richly diverse cast and a female captain, DS9 had a black commander, a gender fluid main character, and often wrote episodes that explored the devastation and aftermath of war.    Meanwhile, the new movies have a whopping total of two people of color in the main cast, a white-washed Kahn, three total named female characters who have lines (all of whom have appeared partially naked).   Zero gay couples, zero trans people, zero disabled characters, and a huge emphasis on violent ""problem solving"". I can't believe it's 2015 and this huge budget series is ethically straggling behind a schmaltzy TV show written in the 60s.

Except in this day and age, the girl is not just there to be a pretty face.  She actually does things relevant to the plot.    I've actually got some hope for this.  The last two were not that bad either, but certainly the feel is different.  This will be closer.. give it a chance guys.  And try to ignore that stupid trailer.

Five minutes in, and we're already seeing a Borg Cube taking out ships by the second. Then we see a bombing, a firefight, a fight aboard a starship, another firefight, etc. We even see Picard with a goddamn tommy gun.  But the thing was, First Contact also had a story, and nuanced messages. We got two new, dynamic characters introduced, we got backstory for the world we know and love, we learned old flaws of our favorite characters, and we felt for them. They did action, they did science, they did drama, and *NONE OF IT WAS BORING*. It was a smart movie, but like this, it was accessible to everyone as long as they knew the characters.  Everyone loved it. It's still the 4th-highest-grossing Trek movie yet, including the reboots, and it almost made double its budget. The film buffs enjoyed the direction and themes, the mass audience ate up the action, and the nerds had all the technobabble and continuity they could want.  It's too early to judge Beyond, but it just seems generic and dumbed-down, even for the reboot. The trailer has a couple cool shots, and the bit with Bones is pretty funny, but that's all I'm seeing.

Stick with low tones, sweeping cello and bass, or go the Inception route and do the plunging BWAAAAAAA's over epic wide angle shots.    You want to show that your movie is just a mindless action romp they won't remember the next day?  That's when you slap 8,000 action shots together in quick succession and dub over everything with an extraordinarily cliche pop song.  This is basic shit, guy.

The movie looks eh, it looks like the actors are in a set honestly and 0:34 looks extremely fake (still, the movie hasn't finished it's effects) and it looks almost exactly like that scene from Furious 7.

Take everything about it that they love out, or (to paraphrase Simon Pegg) ""make it less Star Trek-y"".  This wont be a Star Trek Movie. This will be a Guardians of the Fast and Furious Movie staring the characters of Star Trek.  Paramount are trying to appeal to a different audience by (pardon the pun) alienating the audience they already have. The greatest asset with Star Trek fans is they are fiercely loyal, and have stuck with the franchise for generations (that one was intentional). They host podcasts, dress up as characters, have heated debates about canon and the next generation (ok, ill stop now) of star trek fans will do the same.   This different audience that paramount are trying to appeal to are fickle, short attention span types who tend to forget about something the moment something newer and shinier comes out.

2015-12-15T06:44:03,"The first line of the opening crawl is ""Luke Skywalker has disappeared.""   The first sentence in the movie is ""This will begin to make things right"", said by Max von Sydow. Poe Dameron came to him to get the map to Luke Skywalker for The Resistance.   Max von Sydow's role is just a cameo, he has about 10 sentences before Kylo Ren kills him.   The Empire is now The First Order, The Rebels are now The Resistance, more extreme fraction of the New Republic, who are supposedly pussies. We only see the New Republic planet for a few seconds before it's destroyed by the Starkiller base.   Almost no one in the movie believes that Jedis and Luke Skywalker ever existed.   Kylo Ren captures Poe and uses the Force to stop laser blast so that it remains floating in the air, frozen in place.   Finn helps captured Poe to escape from the Star Destroyer only because he cannot pilot TIE fighter himself. Poe is an expert pilot, Finn can shoot lasers. They become friends.   Finn's ""real name"" is FN and four numbers. Poe starts to call him ""Finn"" because it's easier to pronounce. FN likes it.   After 20 minutes, we are supposed to think that Poe Dameron was killed in the TIE crash on Jakku. He reappers near the end (he ejected before the crash) to lead the attack on Starkiller base. He is not in the film very much. Finn wears Poe's jacket during most of the movie.   Rey meets Finn, they steal the Millennium Falcon from the junkyard and fly away. Han and Chewie catch them soon, followed by two groups of racially-stereotyped space gangsters.   Chewbacca is wounded by space gangsters soon after he appears and spends most of the remaining time doing nothing. Rey takes his place as Falcon's pilot, proving herself to Han.   Kylo Ren is Han and Leia's son. He is ""Master of The Knights of Ren"" but it's not explained what it means.   Kylo Ren's real name is Ben. He was trained by Luke but then turned to the Dark Side which was the reason for Luke blaming himself and disappearing.   The Starkiller base charges by draining suns and then destroys whole solar systems. The shot in trailer with Kylo Ren and red flare is the Starkiller base firing. Guess what, the Starkiller base can be destroyed by flying in her trench and shooting the ""oscillator"" or whatever.   Han meets Kylo at the Starkiller base/planet and tries to persuade him to return with him. ""I am torn apart, father. But I know what I must do. Can you help me?"" - ""Of course, my son."" They almost embrace. Kylo pierces Han with lightsaber. ""Thank you, father."" Dead Han falls into the shaft on the Starkiller base. Yes, he is dead. Most definitely.   Leader Snoke is the bald CGI bad guy with large scar across his face. He has snake-like movements but his body is never clearly seen. His motivation or origin is never explained. He gives orders to Kylo Ren and General Hux (who hate each other). Most of the characters don't know about Snoke's existence.   General Hux has screaming monologue in front of thousands of Stormtroopers: ""We stand upon this mighty weapon you've built. Everyone will bow to The First Order. Today will be remembered as the last day of The Republic!"" Afterwards, all Stormtroopers raise their fists. Very nice Der Fuhrer moment.   Fan service: Holochess. The levitating training ball from Episode 4. Admiral Ackbar. Rey living in the AT-AT wreckage. ""1138"" mentioned. Garbage chute and trash compactor mentioned. Kesel Run mentioned.   Simon Pegg plays an alien called Ankar Plutt who took care of Rey when she was very little and her parents disappeared. Now he runs a junkyard on Jakku and buys scrap from Rey. His face and voice is not recognizable.   Apart from Han and Chewie, all the ""original characters"" (Leia, R2D2, C3PO) only appear after two thirds of the movie, when The Resistance lands on Maz Kanata's planet.   Maz Kanata (small CGI gypsy) is the new Yoda and explains everything cryptically. Nobody understands her.   Han and Leia see each other for the first time after many, many years and have a touching conversation about their son: ""You can still save him."" / ""How can I save him when Luke couldn't?"" / ""Luke was a Jedi, your are his father.""   Kylo Ren and Rey have duel of wills. Rey wins, telling Kylo: ""I sense your fear. You are afraid that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader.""   Kylo Ren talks to Vader's helmet: ""Show me the darkness. I will finish what you started, grandfather.""   R2D2 spends the whole movie powered down and doesn't do anything until 5 minutes at the very end when it's discovered that crucial part of the Skywalker map is in his memory, probably but there by Luke long time ago. (It's not very clear but Luke appears with R2D2 in a flashback.)   Rey has a weird dream/flashback after she finds Luke's lightsaber in Maz Kanata's castle and touches it. The dream contains lots of quick imagery and short voiceovers by Yoda and Obi-Wan. Several famous shots in trailers (Kylo and his posse, Luke's mechanical arm on R2D2) are from this dream montage and are never explained in the movie.   Finn's origin (his skin color, who are his parents, why he hates the First Order) is never explained.   C3PO's red hand is never explained. In fact, there are many things that are never explained in this movie...   Both Finn and Rey have lightsaber duel with Kylo in the forest on the Starkiller planet/base. Finn is badly wounded and spends rest of the movie in a coma. Rey finally falls in love with him. (He loved her from the first sight.)   Starkiller base/planet is succesfully destroyed by The Resistance. We don't know what happens with Kylo Ren (who was there) but he probably survived. Snoke sends the message to Hux to ""Bring Kylo Ren to me complete his training.""   The last sentence of the movie is ""May the Force be with you"", said by Leia to Rey.   After the last sentence, there is an extended sequence without dialogue: Rey leaves the Resistance base in the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca. They find remote planet where Luke is hiding (because they now have the map), Rey goes to the ""first Jedi Temple"" (which looks like ruins of some Scottish castle on a rocky island). Luke is there, dressed in old Obi-Wan style hood. Rey returns his sword to him. Apart from this sequence, Luke only appears for three seconds in Rey's previous flashback. Luke speaks no words in the whole movie and is onscreen maybe for 30 seconds total. He never meets anyone else than Rey.",2,7,Kasai Kouhai,XRVD32rnzOw,0.025938302337758855,2015-12-15 06:44:03,True,True

And, although I do find that these new films aren't ""ye old Trek,"" they still do offer some decent entertainment. Whereas the old shows delved deep into thought-provoking topics/themes, these new films just graze the surface while being injected with plenty of spectacle as substitution. And, from this trailer anyhow, this one does not seem to be slowing down in that trend. So, we'll have to wait and see just how much the ""surface to substance"" ratio has been affected before I decide on how I will feel about the new films going forward.  Are the new films bad? No, they aren't. They are entertaining. Are they as good as (or better than) ANYTHING Trek that has come previously? Definitely not.

What I can tell you is this; some movies will be better than others based on the methodology to reach different people covering different opinions and views. Not every movie made by either franchise can win all people's hearts and vote. What I do know is this, each time another movie is made, more and more people are aware of these universes hence more money for the creators and franchises. These movies provide jobs and entertainment = plain and simple.  I for one couldn't care or less for this trailer as compared to the Force Awakens trailer - two completely different levels of WOW factor for me personally. At the end of day, die hard fans will pick apart everything they want and they have every right too as they are fans. At the beginning of the next day, who gives a shit.

Here's a completely new movie that has nothing to do with the original series or movies at all except for the crew and the ship. And we're going to destroy the ship so you can't piss and moan about that anymore. In fact, we're going to make this movie so hard core about the people that we're going to introduce a warring faction of natives to this new world with the Enterprise being caught between, and likely needing to help settle the conflict, that in effect we're going back to TNG style Star Trek (the best Star Trek).  Fans: ARGH! THIS IS TERRIBLE.   Seriously. Listen to yourselves. You are just the worst kinds of fans. You're asking for movies that are exactly like the originals. News flash: The original movies all sucked. ALL of them. It wasn't until TNG that any Star Trek movie wasn't a complete ball of pure garbage.

I was excited to hear about the new Star trek Beyond, because I heard it was supposed to be about exploration. Let me just say, they trailer made me cringe.

Star Trek, while being the hyper-generic ""Dungeons and Dragons"" of science fiction, was always made exclusively for this super-niche audience. Star Trek was made by talented artists and intelligent nerds, and that's wonderful. Kudos. However, it always lacked 1 thing: A director who just wanted to make a good movie. THAT is what Star Trek has always lacked. The best Star Trek movies were always ones where the director decided to do something different and add a little flavor that wasn't there before. Star Trek is bland. Let's face it. And let me explain what I mean. I loved Prometheus. Dense, complex and deep writing don't bother me. I loved 2001: Space Oddessy. Really slow pacing to set the tone doesn't bother me. What I don't like about Star Trek is that it's always been very bland. No personality. It was so generic, yet so inexpressive that each episode/movie just felt like a generic smoothie of science fictiony/Star Trekky stuff. This fundamental flaw is the very thing that J.J. Abrams immediately keyed in on and corrected. Yes his films have various internal flaws, but no script is truly perfect.  Just take this for what it is and try to enjoy it.

He went from living behind Sears to a Plantation and at the time was a wealthy area.    They both did separate Tax returns because Brian made so little money, that he received a tax refund. The fact is, Brian hit the money load whether he knew it before or 6 weeks after being married as he stated is not relevant.   He mocks people that really work and makes it like he has everything because HE worked for it.. NOT true at all  That's why AL is banned from the show because he found out the truth and that why Brian wont take his calls.. But he tells everyone he not scared of any callers.

Why not stay true to what you are and build something incredible out of that? Not everything has to be an action movie. I LOVE action movies but I'm getting sick of this. Some diversity in movie genres is good too. This is just too much of the same shit.,0,0,Hieillua,XRVD32rnzOw,0.1570767195767196,2015-12-15 23:19:59,True,True

Star Trek is very beloved because of its philosophical and exploratory nature. The reason I have had a problem with JJ is that he doesn't care about Star Trek and has a profound disconnect with it. He made action films and tried to piece together relationships in a flimsy manner. The writers he chose were not any better. The two movies come off as soulless and hackneyed scripted action films. There isn't anything that makes me  really enjoy and love these characters as I have from the TV Series.  Star Trek films have never been completely strong. The later TNG movies after First Contact were abominable. I didn't even like Enterprise the TV series at first but then when I did a front to back watching of Trek I fell in love with it. If you wanted gritty action with many philosophical underpinnings - you had it in that show. Star Trek is a beautiful world of very thoughtful characters and political, philosophical and humanistic proportions. It's why I feel so strongly about it and it's preservation. It isn't mere nostalgia. I am a kid of the late 70s. I grew up with TNG. I saw TOS later. I don't respect JJ for what he has done to Star Trek.",2,1,LS7,XRVD32rnzOw,0.1918181818181818,2015-12-16 01:30:50,True,True

Now a trailer comes out for the next movie and suddenly everyone seems to be able to tell if it's good or bad from a few minute commercial for the the flick. Star Trek like Bond will live on even if the original actors, writer and producers aren't involved anymore, and to try to keep new people coming in they will change the course of Star Trek. Paramount used to scrimp on ST's budget, now they throw nearly 200 million at the screen and they expect some return, so instead of bitching about how much you hate, be thankful you still can go to a theater and see it every few years.

Ok music is off and doesn't belog with the trailer but that doesn't mean that the whole movie will be bad. You don't know the strory behind it, neither character development. You just have bias toward it and you don't know anything. Yeah it's is utterly action-packed but that is a trailer. Scenes from the whole movie crammed in 1:34 minutes. That doesn't mean squat. Wait and see, than judge.   I'm a big fan of Star Trek and although I love the original series and movies, and TNG, DS9 I don't think J.J. Abrams did bad job at all. In my opinion he did excellent job and albeit his movies don't depict the core values of Gene Roddenberry they are still great. New look, new vision that correlates with todays society.

When I thought about it, I kind of  realized I was going against everything Gene stood for. He wanted to challenge the world to allow things to evolve. Every series has had detractors and purists who rage against it and I can respect their love and defence but for ME I realized I was being foolishly unsupportive of exactly what Papa Gene was all about if I didn't give them a chance. Remember Elvis was the devil to one generation's parents and now he's considered tame as all hell.

Can we diversify the female roles in action movies just a tiny bit? its like the writers copied and pasted Michonne from the walking dead, then changed her outfit to avoid a lawsuit. And theres about a dozen others exactly like her. Get past the idea that a girl in a movie has to be either a hyper feminine love interest for one of the main characters, or a hyper masculine badass who still contributes almost nothing, and accept that you could just make them a regular damn character. Think if captain pike did everything he did in the first two movies, but was played by a girl. the movie would be NO DIFFERENT except that it would add variety to the classic ""mentor turned parental-figure helps out his favorite student"" shtick. I mean its not like kirk was introduced playing death metal in his bedroom, reading a copy of playboy magazine and wearing the equipment from 3 different sports at once, all while watching Black Hawk Down, because his gender isn't a focus of his character. his character focuses on his goofiness, strong sense of honor, friendship with spock, and ability to rise to any occasion.

I remember the first official trailer for star trek 2009 was pretty much on this level of action movie tone and people were freaked out, then they released trailer 3? I think, which had a much more dramatic and serious and EPIC tone, which made people a lot happier. I really really don't think beastie boys was a good decision for a star trek trailer. It makes this movie look insecure about itself when it relies so heavily on referencing such a small aspect of a previous installment in order to boost it's appeal and marketability in such a generic way. They have a real opportunity to distance this installment from Abrams obvious Star Wars fetish he just couldn't resist shoving into the last two movies throughout, and I hope they take it in a direction Abrams couldn't or wouldn't, and embrace the plethora of content and ideas Trek has offered over the years and what made it special to begin with. Here I see the potential for a story about human ingenuity in a desperate situation, which, yeah, can be a platform for an interesting story if told right, just as many episodes of trek have done before in a similar way. The creators of this are clearly caught between capturing what made the abrams treks appealing, and what makes ALL the rest of Trek appealing, while telling a story the previous films didn't (presumably). not an easy spot to be in. I will say that Abrams had some really great ideas for the cinematography and ways the camera moved and flowed and framed shots,more so in the first movie especially. And overall I don't feel that I am seeing the same level of competence and artistry here in that regard. I have to be completely honest and just say too, this movie looks cheaper than the last two, way cheaper. From Chris Pines hair and makeup to the seemingly limited locations and overall toned down use of special effects and apparent lack of truly epic set pieces seen in previous films ( with the exception of whatever happens to the enterprise that shit looks serious), I'm definitely not getting the same vibe here that made the Abrams Treks appealing in their own right in terms of the epic scale and adventure.

Why the fuck are they using 2013's COMPUTER GAME LINGO? Are they fucking playing DOTA on the holoscreens, then yelling ""yo noob learn to play"" as well?  Why the hell are they using fucking game/internet lingo in A FUCKING FUTURE ALTERNATE UNIVERSE WHERE HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND SOCIETY HAS EVOLVED TO AN INTERSTELLAR SPECIES............ Fuck. This kind of lazy shit to ""connect with the audience"" is so fucking ridiculous.  Why not just fucking throw in a dumb god damn meme like ""LUL spock, your base are belong to us, noob""? Why not? Same fucking thing, same exact thing. Just as god damn illfitting and ridiculous and makes no logical linguistic sense in the entire fucking setting of the movie. Its like having the Dwarves in LOTR say ""Yo dawg toss me, i'll fuck em up, gangnam style!""  WHAT FUCKING RELEVANCE DOES THIS HAVE TO THE SETTING? You cant just fucking pull REAL LIFE CURRENT INTERNET CULTURE LINGO into a completely different fictional time period and setting, for fucking fucks god damn fucking sake! God, the scriptwriters are so god damn moronic beyond belief, HOW do they get such high paying AAA jobs? Unbelievable.   0:42 THATS NOT FUNNY YOU DUMB SCRIPTWRITER FUCKS... Sorry, lol. Just.. Jesus christ, how did they FUCK IT UP so badly? And the music, and the scenes. The acting. The script, the fuckin dialogue.. ""Dauyymmmn i'm suffering from mid-life crisis and will now attempt to make a HIP RADICAL movie to appeal to the YOUNG AUDIENCE""  No, just no. You fuckin failed. This doesnt appeal to anyone. This is as pathetic as a 55 year old dad trying to sing Britney Spears - Baby Hit Me One More Time in karaoke at his daughters prom night, to appear ""hip and cool"" for her friends. How the fuck can they completely misunderstand, 1. What the fuck STAR TREK even is, and 2. What the fuck the young generation finds cool or interesting. Because this is jack shit of either of the two. This is just pure fucking trash.  This is another Hollywood ""American Pie teenage angst movie"". Fuck this, the ""new"" Star Trek reboot is dead.  I'm going back to Season 1 Episode 1. It had far more balls and ""youth cool factor"" than this piece of grand-dad desperate-pathetic-attempt at being ""cool"" has. Fucking Kirk or Pickard, a bald aging man in spandex, has more cool factor and youth appeal than this fucking trailer has despite all the CGI and EXPLOSIONS and TITS. Dont give a fuck about the tits, and im still a perverted horny mother fucker, let me tell you, still dont give a fuck about the tits in this movie, give me old granddad Pickard or Kirk anyday instead of this, at least they werent desperate mid-life-crisis fools trying to impress 13 year olds. They were real fuckin actors, real fuckin men. They weren't pretending to be anything they weren't.  JJ Abrams must be a virgin.

NOT Khan returns, damages the Enterprise, finds Genesis, tries to kill Kirk, submarine battle in space, Khan is beaten, Khan tries to destroy the Enterprise with Genesis, Spock sacrifices himself to save the ship.  We've all seen Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan, a cinematic masterpiece that few could ever top, that we can watch over and over again knowing full damn well about the emotionalism over Spock's heroic sacrifice and solid story with solid acting.  BUT guarded by the fact that Spock is going to return on the next movie.  BUT what so few seem to realize, or even spot because the new movies were not dumb down for them, is that they doubles the humour, tripled the action, and centupled the lens flare.... yes centupled is a real word, the very thing that makes Star Trek what it is is still very much present.  The only real difference is that the story and action are streamlined without stepping on each others toes, but the purists are tripping over their own feet as they try to keep up.  Poverty, disease and war are pretty much gone on Earth in the new movies.  It's the Enterprise not on a mission to save the people from Earth from their own undoing or restoring freedom to the Federation, but the Enterprise explore us, humanity.  Seeing our successes and failures, seeing ourselves as the crew of the Enterprise.  Seeing a world not as is, but seeing it what we want it to be.  Where we come together despite our differences not because of a common enemy, but a common goal.

One, humor - a kind of humor that I enjoy, which stems primarily from the eccentricities of the characters.  Two, the setting, which appears to be on an alien planet.  This, for me, goes back to the original movies and series quite well, and it's what I missed in the previous films.  Being stranded on an alien planet and having only their brains and their guts with them to figure out how to get off while also dealing with potentially hostile locals.  And three, a new, strong female character, of which I am always appreciative, especially in films. I have always loved the various series and I grew up watching them, but I know I am not a real Trekkie like some, so can I ask respectfully what you guys disliked about the other new films (I read through some of the comments and saw quite a bit of hate on them)?  For me (I'm saying that a lot... haha~), I really enjoyed them.  I liked how they kept a number of the themes of the original without purely copying it and how they managed to combine action and high technology/SFX with character depth, humor, and a compelling plot/drama.

2015-12-31T12:34:29,"It's amazing how many people on this comments thread are forgetting that most of the 12 previous Star Trek movies are action/adventure/comedy movies FIRST, and Star Trek movies SECOND.  The very best Star Trek movies IMO are Wrath of Khan and Undiscovered Country, yet those were the two movies that pissed off Roddenberry the most!    The movie that perhaps most resembles Roddenberry's vision was The Motion Picture, which moves at a snail's pace.  I caught it again over Christmas and the scene where Kirk and Scotty approach the Enterprise is literally 5 minutes long.  It's the exact opposite of 'entertaining.'    What I'm saying is: this movie is no different than all the other TOS, TNG and Reboot movies.  Every fan knows that Trek lives and breathes best on TV, but let's not kid ourselves: it's ALSO a thrill to see starships on the big screen too, with a budget that can generate truly alien worlds.    This 90 second trailer is selling the spectacle but it seems to me that the film itself will really address, for the first time in any Trek movie, the dangers of going where no one has gone before.  I can only think of the TNG episode Q Who, where the crew first encounter the Borg, that similarly highlights the very real possibility that you'll eventually bump into something you can't handle.

2016-01-17T02:01:06,"I think this movie is Beyond ""mindless action"".  Many of these comments are very biased towards this film and even previous films.  The first 2009 movie is a reboot that did a great job telling an original story.  Although it didn't go many places where no man has gone before it gave a sense of homage to the older series giving both the old and new trekkies/audience something to like and understand.  It's very clear that no one understood the meaning behind Into Darkness.  A sequel that focused on the Star Fleet losing their path since they were corrupted with revenge against Khan.   And Star Trek Beyond looks like they're giving what you all complained about from the last film, new worlds, new life, new adventures, etc...... So honestly what's the deal?  Is it simply because the movie is directed by Justin Lin?  Is it because you saw scenes in the trailer that had action in it?  Is that it?  It's too easy to criticize the work of a film without bothering to put yourselves in their place and see how it is like working with a production like this.  Not for just the director but for the other crew who work to make these films happen...  Not an easy job.  So far I haven't seen one legitimate reason why this film looks bad other than that it has ""mindless action"" and ""the music doesn't fit"".    Can't judge an entire movie because of one trailer.  We will have to wait and see how the film turns out when it hits theaters.",1,0,Media Matters,XRVD32rnzOw,0.11303503787878787,2016-01-17 02:01:06,True,True

2016-02-23T03:41:01,"Star Trek fans who hate the new movies have some valid criticisms, but the bitching and moaning about the new franchise in general is fucking pathetic. Okay, I agree that Into Darkness wasn't original, was annoying to watch, and didn't have many deep thematic elements that Star Trek usually has, but I liked the first Star Trek movie. I'm a fan of the TV shows, yet I like the new cast members because unlike most Trekkies, I accept that we are in different times. Star Trek is going to have more action because the typical philosophical material, while great, makes for a boring movie for general audiences. As sad as it is, the Star Trek fanbase isn't large enough to make for big box office numbers, and that doesn't cut it for a blockbuster film. The deeper themes can (and should) still be present, even if that means weaving a bit more action into the mix. The problem with Abrams is that while his first movie was perfect for reintroducing the characters and the franchise, basically doing the same thing for the second movie was where the criticisms that he shouldn't be handling Star Trek became valid. It's why he was perfect for directing The Force Awakens. He's good at pacing, visuals, energy, and at directing his actors, which makes him a great action movie director, but when it comes to deeper character stuff, I agree that it's better left in the hands of someone like Rian Johnson. Now, Jeremy Lin may not be that guy for this Star Trek movie, but Simon Pegg, a huge Star Trek fan, helped write the script for this movie. Everyone involved that's not Abrams (and maybe he finally knows why, too) knows that this movie needs to different. That's why, unlike the other virgin Trekkies, I'm giving this movie the chance it deserves. Good God.

2016-03-16T09:52:03,"Wow you guys are pathetic. I mean seriously. If you compare every movie, or every new series that they create to the original Star Trek series then you may as well just kill the series now. It is proof in itself that the creatore of Star Trek made something special because they are still making movies about it. If every movie and every series was JUST LIKE the original then the franchise would just die, it would be boring, repeatitive, and have no life ion it what so ever. The movies are starting to move with the times, as we do. Yes there is more action in them, but that doesnt stop you feeling or connecting with the characters. It doesnt stop you from getting involved in the story. Yes maybe they could put some more memorable lines in there and maybe bring out the history a little more but they can only put so much into a movie. You guys are picking at the smallest of things, like the song choice for the trailer as an example... WTF is the point in that? Your honestly gonna sit there and bitch about a sing choice? Grow up already. Then your going to bitch about the fact that theres a motorbike in it and automatically link it to the director because he did Fast 7? again, grow up. Instead of camparing the new movies to the originbal series you need to see them as their own movie, you need to see them as the next chapater of the franchise, a franchise that is still growing, that is still gaining new fans. The new movies reach out to a new generation of fans, just like the original series did to us. I personally think its fantastic that Star Trek can go into new directions, take on new dimesions, and give new meaning to some of the most well known sci fi characters ever created. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Simon Pegg, Zoe Salender and the rest of the cast are doing such an amazing job with their given charcaters and should be credited for their hard work not slated by bunch of Trekkie Fans that are clearly still stuck in the past.

Some of the best hours of science fiction ever televised.  The Inner Light, Measure of a Man, Best of Both Worlds, Duet, The Visitor, What You Leave Behind...  Heck, even a couple Voyager episodes were good, like Scorpion and Timeless.  Trek wasn't really about phasers and warp speed, it was about stories.  Stories about hope and courage and decency and ethics, science fiction was just the setting, they were really always about heart.  ...Hey.  Hey, stop laughing, I'm serious.""  With low-brow schlock like most of Enterprise, all the TNG movies, and the Abrams movies, how can I possibly hope to explain to youngsters what Trek used to be back when it was good, before the franchise decided to let it rot on the vine?

I measure that from the first impression I got from watching a movie, not from how well it's held up over the years. All this being said, Star Trek movies always suffered from the fact that they never seemed to move on from the TVshow format. JJ Abrams was right on the money, when he asked why ST movies always were shot as if they were on a tight budget and short deadline. The scope was usually as narrow as in a TV episode, and the decore was often only marginally better. Compare the warpcore and engineering from the pre-Abrams era to the new. Small sets, every bulkhead looked like plastic and plywood. Not exactly the feel of a huge starship the size of several city blocks. Especially later, this created a huge contrast between the interior shots and the CGI space shots. Yes, even in Nemesis. 80s, 2000s, 80s, 2000s etc To cut it short, c'mon people!

There seems to be quite a lot of people thinking that Roddenberry would not care for the newer films post 2009. But from what I understood, Roddenberry was forced out of creative control for The Wrath of Khan back in the 80's because the first film was met with mixed reviews. Harve Bennett was given the reigns and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was a big success. People look at Roddenberry as some sort of amazing visionary. That dude cheated on his wife ALL THE TIME (a.k.a. ASSHOLE). So remember, he's just a regular guy, a horney one for sure, even though he created a cool concept for a t.v. series. That's really all it was, a T.V. show. Which means all of that shit is made up and doesn't matter. It's fun but by the end of the day I have to pay my bills, do regular 21st century stuff and pay off the toy Enterprise-A and Bird of Prey on my sons shelf I bought with a credit card.

But we were all cut loose to make way for a new generation of fans, and it sticks in my craw guys and girls. There is only one Captain Kirk, one Spock, and one McCoy.

2016-04-07T16:07:46,"It's a terrible trailer, trying to woo an audience who doesn't like Trek anyway. The fact that it's the 50th anniversary movie of this franchise makes this trailer not only bad, it's insulting.  Look at how Paramount teased ST 6 for its 25th if you want to see how respect of a beloved franchise is treated. Look at how Dr. Who and Star Wars are treated by people who love and respect the history of a show, and all the talented people who came before them.   Star Wars gets treated with all the reverence of a visit by the Pope. The Falcon is rebuilt in exquisite detail. Star Trek gets all of its history flushed down the toilet (except they keep reusing everything anyway for lack of an original idea), and we get an Apple store and a brewery for an Enterprise.  Since the ST franchise is now split in two by corporate buyouts - movies are made and owned by Paramount and Trek TV is owned by CBS/Viacom, we faithful Trekkies may have to give up on the film franchise. Hopefully the new series by CBS (who took the time and effort to restore TOS with new effects and do a frame-by-frame remaster of TNG), will be more faithful. Besides that, Trek was created for TV, and still does best in that format.  So the alternate universe belongs to Paramount. CBS/Viacom owns the ""real"" one.

But these movies you are making, Paramount... They just are not what Trek is all about. And that makes me very sad. I accepted the first Star Trek ""shoot 'em up"" as just a way to get more people involved into the franchise who may not be familiar with it. I gutted the 2nd one's premature use of one of the series' pinnacle villains to basically follow the same underlying premise as Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan; just accepting it as the price of having some form of Star Trek that was new. But when I saw a THIRD movie shaping up to be yet another ""blow stuff up"" Star Trek, it was then that I finally accepted the fact that there must be no one left at Paramount who has any sort of clout that remembers what Trek is all about. It should by learning about ourselves as we embark on that amazing next step out into the stars. While, yes, there may be the occasional blatant rollercoaster ride, for the most part, traditionally it has dared to ask the tough questions in clever ways. And I think that is what I am missing the most here: it's that this Star Trek isn't clever. It seems to just expect me to sit back and oo and ah while it makes references to itself. That is, itself from a time when it really mattered. And now with the whole Axanar lawsuit - and don't get me wrong, Paramount, I can kind of see where you are coming from - I just wonder if Star Trek finally really is dead? And in a day and age where the only real metric of corporate success is measured by growth, ironically it's all about money which is one of the very things that Gene Roddenberry himself had REMOVED from our future! (I'm talking strictly Federation, here) I guess it will stay alive in the hearts and minds of the millions - MILLIONS - still alive who will continue to make amazing fan fiction, which includes movies.  There are few things I really truly need in life and believe it or not Star Trek is one of the things that gets my immobile body out of bed and into my wheelchair each day. Now, here it is the 50th anniversary of Trek...I have made it to this date after growing up with it throughout the years...I have reached this milestone with Trek faithfully by my side in many life events and decisions...and I've found it dying.

2016-04-29T21:24:13,"I saw the first of these Star Trek Reboot movies a few years back and swore I would never see another one of them.  Not because of the cast, who did a good job, or the direction, production or action, each of them equally good.  What I didn't like was the fact that they were made at all. Let me try to explain.  I grew up watching Star Trek TOS & TAS  reruns in the 1970's.  I vaguely remember my dad watching TOS in the 60's when it was on prime time.  TOS and TAS were shows that reflected, commented and addressed the era and issues they were created in:  The 1960's and 1970's.  The characters themselves often were reflecting the people of that era as well and the way they thought, acted and reacted to situations similar to those of those eras .  I can say that TNG, DS9, and Voyager did the same for the 1980's and 1990's as well. But taking Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew and totally rewrite the history of the franchise to have characters from the 1960's act, think and react to situations from the 21st Century is not only unfair to those of us who grew up in the 60's and 70's but its unfair to the young people of today.  Us old people(I'm in my 50's) deserve to have our generations historical treasures left alone while the young people deserve to have characters, stories of THEIR own which reflects THEIR era(Today).  I don't mind taking the Star Trek universe onward like with shows like TNG, DS9 and Voyager(Don't even talk to me about Enterprise) but don't rewrite history.  LEAVE IT ALONE! Now please understand that I'm not blaming the younger generation for this.  The kids today are, as a whole, a good generation with some incredible views on the world.  They also are a source of free tech support to a middle aged man who's smart phone occasionally does something its not supposed to do(LOL).

However, I am still holding out hope that this trailer is just awful (like Simon Pegg says), and the movie itself is more akin to ""real Star Trek"". But even that hope is holding on by a thread, as this movie was incredibly rushed, is STILL undergoing re-shoots, and the studio producing it allegedly stated that they want this movie to be ""less Star Trek-y"".

As a true Trek fan i won't be going to watch this crap. I'm sick to death of the Enterprise being destroyed. There is a reason there are no fighters/drones and its called SHIELDS. This movie needs to flop to send these people a message. The time for JJ trek is OVER. Boycott is junk.,0,1,Aussie Gamer,XRVD32rnzOw,-0.1515873015873016,2016-05-14 17:35:20,True,True

Yeh, I am a writer, I dont have the big connections, it is annoying to see people get paid a great deal for so little thought. I thought the 2009 one was alright and Eric Bana played his role perfect. These movies are like 5/10 movies to me, I think Nimoy saved the 2009 one along with Pike.  Star Trek is all about intellectual prowess. Not just action, they should of started where Kirk is a Cadet and becomes Captain in the third part of a trilogy. Losing Pike in the third act rather than the second, sometimes it takes a great deal of suffering and many mistakes to become a good leader, not a cocky kid. They seem to just give him everything so quickly and easily, they should of made Kirk feel fully responsible for Pikes death and Spock help him see the logic. Beastie Boys track is kind of stupid, its not essential, if you want to create a reminiscing event, use a similar event with higher stakes, not a song. I guarantee no one will remember that song by that time.

As for Spock now embracing his ""human side,"" that's just crappy. It ruins so much with Star Trek's OS dynamic of Spock's logical decisions and inability to understand human emotions. If there is life in the universe there just might be species out there who don't feel emotions like we are familiar with. They might be entirely logical in their decision making.

2016-07-07T23:13:19,"Hello Everyone, I feel I need to post this. For those who might have missed it, due to a fan based film both CBS and Paramount have issued ""guidelines"" that actually destroy all the possibilities of anymore real fan based trek films in the future. If you would like to know more search for ""star trek prelude to Axanar"" and watch the previews and details about the show. There are many fan based films for you to watch and some are really good considering they are not made by a real studio. You will even see a few real actors are involved and the efforts have been made to have a very high quality of production. Yes, some not so much but its about Star Trek not production. Now please consider that for many years now they (CBS and Paramount) have allowed a few groups to make many really good (and some not so good) episodes based on Star Trek in many versions as long as they do not ""make a profit"" from the production. To actual start making the episode Axanar they had a fund drive and made over 1 million US Dollars so, CBS and Paramount sued them to stop production. Recently they released the ""guidelines"" for all future fan based films that are not only not constitutional points (like actors who worked in any trek can’t work in fan based films and vice a versa) but limit production time and costs in such a way that means no less than a clear effort to kill all fan based Star Trek films. Read the complete set of guidelines here: http://www.startrek.com/fan-films I ask all fans to get educated on these Star Trek fan based films to read up on this matter. Please learn the facts about the past films and the possibility of future for more of them. If you cannot agree that CBS and Paramount be allowed to force these guidelines on fan film production please help us stop them. Also please compare the way the fan films for Star Wars are treated where they even offer a public awards show for them. I, and other Star Trek fans are calling for a boycott of the upcoming movie and the 2017 series on CBS unless they publicly stop this and provide the fans with a reasonable and legal ability to enjoy others ideas of the Star Trek world. They have allowed it for years but now they are moving to kill them while hoping it won’t affect them making more money off Star Trek. So, let’s boycott them and stop the money they would make from the 7-22 release of Star Trek Beyond and the 2017 series planned to have one show on TV then the rest on a pay service only from CBS. If they see enough decrease of the upcoming movie sales they will obey us as the fans and workout a real reasonable way for them to continue without the idiotic and illegal current guidelines. I, and more than 20 people I know have agreed to boycott the new film unless this is fixed right.  Thanks for your time.",0,0,Alan Hamby,XRVD32rnzOw,0.1436821789321789,2016-07-07 23:13:19,True,True

2016-07-22T23:43:21,"For all those who are critiquing Spock's human tendencies, please remember that they created room for this development by introducing a time traveling Spock who influenced his younger self. His mother originally lived a lot longer until Nero came back in time and destroyed Vulcan. This exposed Spock to his human emotions which, by nearly direct instructions from the original Spock, Kirk exploited to gain command of the Enterprise in the 2009 movie. This Spock has lost his mother and his homeworld at a point in his life where his hasn't had time to build up a strong enough wall to mask his human side. He has also explored a romantic relationship with Uhura during his time of crisis which further opened him up to his emotions. I'm not sure why everyone is so upset about the character development straying from TOS but clearly you're lacking a grasp of the concept of time travel. Introducing that one element into the new series has left all future character development and encounters with TOS villains like Khan to be unpredictable and therefore better able to entertain a new generation and old fans alike by taking us down an alternate timeline.

Beyond is definitely homage to the more adventurous classic episodes and is geared to broader audiences than last film and i can appreciate the change. Crew is once again amazing and chemistry is off the charts, adventure kicks into 5th gear and never stops, dialogue is witty and fresh and it makes you feel for the characters. It is also exciting, thrilling and always on the edge of your seat entertainment. What bothered me is how Justin Lins directing style doesn't mesh with star trek tradition and how god awful villain in this movie was. I mean the directing was really awful, there were moments where i just could not see what is going on, especially during the dark scenes. As for Krall/Edison it was the most lazy, generic and uninspiring way to go about bad guy and it just did not work. I did not care about him or his agenda.

The villain was a little bit too much of the tired trope ""former ally turns evil and tries to take revenge"" type, but Idris Elba at least portrayed him well.  The most enjoyable parts of the movies for me were the character interactions with the crew, though I did also enjoy Jaylah and her role in helping them find the USS Franklin, which seemed like a nod back to the Enterprise series, which I very much miss, so it was nice to see that thrown in.  I was really hoping the villains in this might turn out to be Romulans, which would have added more depth than the ""former captain wants revenge on Star Fleet"".

I mean ok, i enjoy Kirk and co, but the plot was pedestrian at best and i've seen less generic villains in a Power Rangers episode. Both factors were absolute zero, compared to Into Darkness. And then we get the one-note hot alien babe we're supposed to drool at/feel for and who - sad shocker - likes rap. Did the director think only hare-brained high schoolers would watch this? (with no disrespect to Sofia Boutella.... besides, why even cast her if you won't make proper room in the movie for her dancing skills like Kingsmen did? All we get is some flat, inelegant combat).

Having a strong military to prevent war is very logical. But starting a war to make the country/planet/whatever strong defeats the point. Then there is the fact that the bad guy is a bit of a psycho from being shipwrecked. But I get the impression he became an immortal king of the entire planet overnight.
