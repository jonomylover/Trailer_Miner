2015-02-04T22:18:27,"This is a *Dumb Movie* and I’ll tell you why  So the premise of the movie is that a group of scientist have found a way to bring people back from the dead. However when the person is brought back to life, a demon attaches itself to the soul and brought to earth with the person or creature. My question is, what is the purpose of the demon going on a mindless killing spree?  Think about it for a moment, humans, have found means to bring demons to the mortal plane. Better yet, the person in charge of such an operation has been brought back to life with a demon attached. Now with this set up, wouldn’t it be smarter if the demon instead were to lie and wait, plant messages into her mind to use the Lazarus more and more, bringing more people back to life, bringing along more demons until finally you’re given the opportunity to bring back someone important or powerful like, a President or a Prime Minister with a demon attached to them?  Nope, apparently, demons with supernatural powers are apparently so dumb, the second they get the chance they just want to kill people for the hell of it. This movie is basically like The Purge; a *GREAT* idea with such a boundless premise, able to take the movie into nearly any crazy and unforeseeable way imaginable, and its basically turned into a worthless slasher/killing flick, but with demonic powers. I’ve lost faith in humanity already but I swear if this movie blows up at the box office… ",1,0,Netherwolf6100,1Ks6JqLzVTA,0.0738095238095238,2015-02-04 22:18:27,True,True

I mean seriously, its beyond disrespect. the most annoying part is how they even made Lazarus, Jesus's best friend, a demon, and now one of my classmate is dumb enough to believe that Lazarus is an actual demon from freaking hell! Look people, there is a reason why no one will make fun of religions like the Islamic religion, because there is an outcome, people could die. (remember what happened in France?) Jesus taught us to love and forgiveness. He also warned us about days like these, and how we shouldn't give up, but it doesn't give people the right to do whatever with other's beliefs. I see them make this trailer on TV over and over again, and trust me, it offends many including me. People have made the Bible a way to get money buy using the scriptures to make unnecessary movies like this. I mean think about it, what if this movie's idea was taken from a really harsh religion, will it have been made? Of course not, because we'll know the outcome  and will try not to. Look, I don't care if you believe me or not, but I know that Jesus died for our sins because of the love He has for us, (John 3:16) so it is very unacceptable, to use the bible as a laughing stock. In fact, I'm sure the people who even made this movie, do not even know anything about the bible rather than what is said about it. I have more to say, but typing this is not enough. I am really disturbed and I better hold my peace before I start  insulting how crazy  this generation has become.
