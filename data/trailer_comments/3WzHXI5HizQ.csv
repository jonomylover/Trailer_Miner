I've seen some people say that Nolan sucks and they pretty much never give any good reasons why they just want attention because they think they ""see"" something about his movies everyone else doesn't because everyone calls his movies genius. There is a reason for that, look at The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Prestige, Inception, Memento, He is smart and great at making movies. I'm also not worried about any of the cast, even Topher Grace who I see a lot of people complaining about.

2014-01-12T19:24:19,"In the future, Earth has been devastated by war and famine caused by a plague that targets livestock, leaving only crops. Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer who lives in Texas with his children, Tom and Murph, and his father-in-law, Donald, following the death of his wife. A skilled engineer, Cooper salvages spare parts of a old military drones to use on his plantation.  One day, he finds a probe that crash-lands nearby and, while trying to dismantle it, he accidentally activates a failsafe, forcing him and Murph to return the probe to a particular location near Los Angeles. There, Cooper finds an underground bunker guarded by a Marine robot, Tars, and is confronted by biologist Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) and her father, astrophysicist John Brand, who claims they're the remains of NASA.  John reveals that, before the war, his mentor, Ansen, found a ripple in the space-time continuum caused by the collision of a Neutron star with a black hole, on the other side of the galaxy. The only way the ripple could reach Earth is through a stable wormhole, which Ansen believed was created by aliens to help the human race. Several probes were sent through the wormhole to map out the other side, and the one that Cooper has found is the only one that returned.  John decodes the probe and finds a map of an ice-covered planet that could sustain human life, in addition to what appears to be white noise. There is a plan to launch a spaceship through the wormhole to create a human colony on the ice planet and transport as many humans as they can to the colony before the plague begins affecting the crops, leading to the extinction of the human race. Mission commander Case, another Marine robot, invites Cooper to join the crew, replacing John, who is too old to go. Cooper reluctantly agrees and leaves Tom and Murph with Donald, promising to return.  Cooper, Brand, Tars and Case board a spaceship, the Endurance, alongside two other scientists, Doyle and Roth, and go through the wormhole, in which they experience strange gravity distortions. On the other side of the galaxy, they find the ice planet, which is located between two black holes, Pantagruel and Gargantua. The Endurance uses Pantagruel to slingshot them into the ice planet, but the gravitational pull is too strong. Tars sacrifices himself to steer them in the right direction and is consumed by Gargantua. The Endurance loses contact with Earth, and Brand reveals that, due to time dilatation, five years have already passed on Earth.  The Endurance lands and the crew begins drilling through the planet's ice cap. Cooper finds a Chinese base set up years before, and learns that the human crew was killed by a radiation surge from the Neutron Star. The crew manages to break through the ice before the next surge and reaches the ecosystem underneath the ice cap. While Case, Roth and Doyle set up camp, Cooper and Brand explore the planet and acquire samples of its fractual lifeforms.  The following day, the crew finds the human colony created by the Chinese robots, and Roth retrieves a box that allows them to manipulate the planet's gravity. Case finds out that there is a third black hole between Pantagruel and Gargantua, and, every couple of years, it pushes the planet out of its orbit, causing it to be destroyed and then reassembled. The crew deduces that the robots created the box, though it appears impossible they have created it so fast, and decide to take the box back to Earth, where it can be used to save the planet.  On their way out, they are confronted by the Chinese robots, led by Liu, who refuse to allow them to leave in fear they might find ""it"". Case stays behind to fight them off while the crew attempts to reach the Endurance above the ice cap. However, it has been destroyed by the robots. The crew then decides to leave in a escape shuttle found in the colony. Roth stays behind to use the gravity box to propel the shuttle out of the planet, and Cooper copies its schematics into one of the probes, which the Chinese had abducted, so they can build another box on Earth. Before Roth activates the box, Case returns and reunites with the crew.  After Roth's death, the crew is betrayed by Case, who is actually Liu in disguise. The shuttle is sabotaged and begins being pulled into Pantagruel. The ice planet and the stable wormhole are destroyed, and hundreds of years pass as they near the Event Horizon. Cooper, however, manages to retrieve the coordinates of the place Liu didn't want them to find, which is located inside Gargantua. They head there and find a second stable wormhole, which they enter. It leads them to the space between Universes, where time stands still.  Cooper, Brand and Doyle spend weeks stranded there, aware that the human race has already been destroyed. Cooper and Brand fall in love. The gravity disruptions returns, and Cooper realizes they are extraterrestrial lifeforms attempting to communicate with them. The beings have created the wormholes and lead them to a base the Chinese robots have built inside the nowhere, where they spent years developing new technologies to save the planet, leading to the gravity box. Tars is there, waiting for them.  Brand and Tars decide to take one of the spaceships and go through another wormhole to explore the unknown, while Cooper and Doyle decide to attempt to travel back in time through another wormhole to before their departure. Brand gives Cooper the sample of the fractal lifeform and he promises to find her.  Cooper then realizes that the probe with the box's schematics is the probe he found in Texas, and realizes that, if they go through with their plan, they'll die. Doyle ignores him, tries anyway, and is killed. The probe reaches Earth, creating a time loop.  On Earth, the crew of the Endurance is assumed dead, and the program is shut down after John's death. Several years later, an adult Murph, who has become an engineer like his father, returns to the base to search for spare parts and finds the forgotten probe. He decodes it and finds the box's schematics, and spends the rest of his life trying to build a functional prototype.  After centuries, Cooper returns to Earth, now a barren, deserted wasteland plagued by hailstorms. He releases the fractal lifeform into the wild and awaits for dead when a spaceship descends from the sky. Cooper awakens in a massive space station near Earth, and learns that Murph managed to build the gravity box and save Earth. Cooper then reunites with an elderly Murph, who is on his deathbed, as well as Murph's children and grandchildren.  Cooper requests a spaceship to search for Brand, for is denied. He then becomes a janitor, accompanied by a robot he models after Tars. He learns that an ice cap has formed over Earth, and the fractal lifeforms have spread through the entire planet, and realizes John was right about there being a ""plan"". One day, Cooper and his robotic assistant steal of the spaceships and venture into the unknown to find Brand.",0,5,Uselink,3WzHXI5HizQ,-0.030382207979610592,2014-01-12 19:24:19,True,True

2014-02-28T04:57:16,"This is what modern trailers should aspire to be like. You are given a mood for the film; an inclination of what it will be like. The narration is compelling and engaging, but it doesn't give away any major details about the story, or twists in the narrative. No spoilers are witnessed. Bonus points given since the message is also quite inspiring, and chilling. Basically ""you used to be awesome... remember how awesome you were... now go be awesome again""  Other trailers by contrast very often summarise the entire film that they're supposed to be advertising. They use pivotal clips from the second and third act of the film that ruin suspense and give too much information away. Knowing that certain characters make it to the third act for instance. Likely featuring explosions and dialogue that reveals exposition which shouldn't be in the trailer. Essentially losing intrigue in favour of raising spectacle.  I realise that I am comparing a ""teaser"" trailer here, to modern ""theatrical"" trailers in general. But I remember when THIS trailer would be considered a ""theatrical"" trailer years back, and a ""teaser"" would have even less information. Creating even more intrigue.

2014-03-04T17:25:54,"SPOILEEEEERS!!!  Want to know what's movie about. In 2014 NASA discovers some thingy, a portal to another star and sends probes there. Fast forward 50 years and McConaughey is a wise science guy relegated to being a repairman because he was born in a world that already started to degrade, we had a global war, famine and almost apocalypse and crops are going down each year. McConaughey lost wife during all that and he sees that his children are growing up in a world with no future, one of them is actually talented and likes to tinker with tech but Earth doesn't need scientists anymore, so his only option in life is to be a farmer.   Then one of the probes sent in 2014 returns and McConaughey finds it, dissects and hears that there is some signal recorded on it and the probe points to location in USA where to get it. McConaughey and his son go there and find an underground NASA base slowly falling in decline but with a rocket ready to go. They find out that this was the last big project USA had until everything went to shit and they had managed to keep the base unknown to looters and have advanced robots and shit. Now with the received probe and signal they've got, they can send a rocket out in space to investigate the far away star system and find out what is that signal and perhaps if there is a way to get at least some people off the dying Earth. McConaughey leaves his children behind and goes into space.   Then typical Nolan mindfuck starts, complemented with Avatar level and above visuals and a plot device from Haldeman's Forever War....

2014-03-16T09:21:28,"Great trailer! I can't wait to see the movie. But after reading through some of the comments here I felt like sharing some ideas about possibility of colonizing other planets.  First, if ever we are to space travel and find a suitable planet to colonize, it won't be sustainable enough for humans to live on. Just watch what happened to those alliens in 'War of the Worlds'. It would take a very very long time for us to adjust our physiology to all the micro life and other things you can't yet even think of. Untill then we would have to wear space suits all the time.   Second, on such a planet it is likely for intelligent life to already exist, and that could mean conflict. What if they said no? Would you go to war with aboriginals for the new living space?  Finally, it is far to expensive to transport people that far. That would mean you can only send a small crew of people to start a new colony. You can't possibly hope to evacuate the entire planet unless there is some kind of efficient star gate or instant teleportation technology that could be discovered.  What I am trying to say here is that people are so easily carried away with such unreal ideas before we have even learnt how to take care of Earth.",0,0,Alexandr Sarakapudaff,3WzHXI5HizQ,0.09453423120089788,2014-03-16 09:21:28,True,True

2014-04-21T13:09:39,"From the IMDb ""Sypnosis"" section. ( NOT FROM THE PLOT SECTION, FROM THE SYPNOSIS SECTION)  ""In the future, Earth has been devastated by war and famine caused by a plague that targets livestock, leaving only crops. Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer who lives in Texas with his children, Tom and Murph, and his father-in-law, Donald, following the death of his wife. A skilled engineer, Cooper salvages spare parts of an old military drone to use on his plantation.  One day, he finds a probe that crash-lands nearby and, while trying to dismantle it, he accidentally activates a failsafe, forcing him and Murph to return the probe to a particular location near Los Angeles. There, Cooper finds an underground bunker guarded by a Marine robot, Tars, and is confronted by biologist Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) and her father, astrophysicist John Brand, who claims they're the remains of NASA.  John reveals that, before the war, his mentor, Ansen, found a ripple in the space-time continuum caused by the collision of a Neutron star with a black hole, on the other side of the galaxy. The only way the ripple could reach Earth is through a stable wormhole, which Ansen believed was created by aliens to help the human race. Several probes were sent through the wormhole to map out the other side, and the one that Cooper has found is the only one that returned.  John decodes the probe and finds a map of an ice-covered planet that could sustain human life, in addition to what appears to be white noise. There is a plan to launch a spaceship through the wormhole to create a human colony on the ice planet and transport as many humans as they can to the colony before the plague begins affecting the crops, leading to the extinction of the human race. Mission commander Case, another Marine robot, invites Cooper to join the crew, replacing John, who is too old to go. Cooper reluctantly agrees and leaves Tom and Murph with Donald, promising to return.  Cooper, Brand, Tars and Case board a spaceship, the Endurance, alongside two other scientists, Doyle and Roth, and go through the wormhole, in which they experience strange gravity distortions. On the other side of the galaxy, they find the ice planet, which is located between two black holes, Pantagruel and Gargantua. The Endurance uses Pantagruel to slingshot them into the ice planet, but the gravitational pull is too strong. Tars sacrifices himself to steer them in the right direction and is consumed by Gargantua. The Endurance loses contact with Earth, and Brand reveals that, due to time dilatation, five years have already passed on Earth.  The Endurance lands and the crew begins drilling through the planet's ice cap. Cooper finds a Chinese base set up years before, and learns that the human crew was killed by a radiation surge from the Neutron Star. The crew manages to break through the ice before the next surge and reaches the ecosystem underneath the ice cap. While Case, Roth and Doyle set up camp, Cooper and Brand explore the planet and acquire samples of its fractual lifeforms.  The following day, the crew finds the human colony created by the Chinese robots, and Roth retrieves a box that allows them to manipulate the planet's gravity. Case finds out that there is a third black hole between Pantagruel and Gargantua, and, every couple of years, it pushes the planet out of its orbit, causing it to be destroyed and then reassembled. The crew deduces that the robots created the box, though it appears impossible they have created it so fast, and decide to take the box back to Earth, where it can be used to save the planet.  On their way out, they are confronted by the Chinese robots, led by Liu, who refuse to allow them to leave in fear they might find ""it"". Case stays behind to fight them off while the crew attempts to reach the Endurance above the ice cap. However, it has been destroyed by the robots. The crew then decides to leave in a escape shuttle found in the colony. Roth stays behind to use the gravity box to propel the shuttle out of the planet, and Cooper copies its schematics into one of the probes, which the Chinese had abducted, so they can build another box on Earth. Before Roth activates the box, Case returns and reunites with the crew.  After Roth's death, the crew is betrayed by Case, who is actually Liu in disguise. The shuttle is sabotaged and begins being pulled into Pantagruel. The ice planet and the stable wormhole are destroyed, and hundreds of years pass as they near the Event Horizon. Cooper, however, manages to retrieve the coordinates of the place Liu didn't want them to find, which is located inside Gargantua. They head there and find a second stable wormhole, which they enter. It leads them to the space between Universes, where time stands still.  Cooper, Brand and Doyle spend weeks stranded there, aware that the human race has already been destroyed. Cooper and Brand fall in love. The gravity disruptions returns, and Cooper realizes they are extraterrestrial lifeforms attempting to communicate with them. The beings have created the wormholes and lead them to a base the Chinese robots have built inside the nowhere, where they spent years developing new technologies to save the planet, leading to the gravity box. Tars is there, waiting for them.  Brand and Tars decide to take one of the spaceships and go through another wormhole to explore the unknown, while Cooper and Doyle decide to attempt to travel back in time through another wormhole to before their departure. Brand gives Cooper the sample of the fractal lifeform and he promises to find her.  Cooper then realizes that the probe with the box's schematics is the probe he found in Texas, and realizes that, if they go through with their plan, they'll die. Doyle ignores him, tries anyway, and is killed. The probe reaches Earth, creating a time loop.  On Earth, the crew of the Endurance is assumed dead, and the program is shut down after John's death. Several years later, an adult Murph, who has become an engineer like his father, returns to the base to search for spare parts and finds the forgotten probe. He decodes it and finds the box's schematics, and spends the rest of his life trying to build a functional prototype.  After centuries, Cooper returns to Earth, now a barren, deserted wasteland plagued by hailstorms. He releases the fractal lifeform into the wild and awaits for dead when a spaceship descends from the sky. Cooper awakens in a massive space station near Earth, and learns that Murph managed to build the gravity box and save Earth. Cooper then reunites with an elderly Murph, who is on his deathbed, as well as Murph's children and grandchildren.  Cooper requests a spaceship to search for Brand, for is denied. He then becomes a janitor, accompanied by a robot he models after Tars. He learns that an ice cap has formed over Earth, and the fractal lifeforms have spread through the entire planet, and realizes John was right about there being a ""plan"". One day, Cooper and his robotic assistant steal of the spaceships and venture into the unknown to find Brand who is aboard EVENT HORIZON.""

2014-05-15T05:20:15,"Why do I see such vicious nationalism from all countries when I read youtube comments. Does it matter which country the people who made leaps into space came from? It reminds me of the World War 2 era in which nationalism permeated throughout many societies. Have we not grown as a species at all since then? When you think about it, that is one of the major sources of human conflict today. A ridiculous and childish attachment to the country one is born into that makes many believe that their country is ""the best."" As Einstein said, ""Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind.""  How about we enjoy space achievements not for the prestige they bring to a nation, but for the adventurous exploration of the unknown that they represent. We, as a species, are intelligent enough to escape the gravitational bindings which had kept all living things restricted to the Earth for billions of years. It's truly awe-inspiring. After ions of time, we finally have the potential to explore the inconceivably vast expanse of space. Think about how much knowledge is out there in space waiting to be known and how many beautiful worlds, like Earth, waiting to be visited. When you think about our lives from this cosmic perspective, patriotism and nationalism seem to be a pathetic outmoded Earth-centered outlook. Why don't we expand our outlook, take a look at the stars, and embrace the immensity of unimaginable discoveries that lie ahead if we continue making bold reaches into space. The moment Yuri Gagarin orbited the Earth in 1961, space exploration became the responsibility of the ENTIRE human race, precisely because we are the only species on the Earth with the capability to shoot for the stars.   For anyone still reading this, thank you for that and I hope you share my enthusiasm. It pains me that humans are capable of such wonders and the general public barely even thinks about space and the larger perspective. While I'm writing this, I'm thinking about what I, as one teenager, can do to change anything. But I just realized that the internet provides a striking opportunity to make a global impact on many many people. On a whim, I am asking anyone out there if they want to join me on an intellectual revolution of some sort and try to begin an era in human history in which space becomes a central focus of our daily lives. Think about what tremendous acceleration this would give to space exploration if people across the world started supporting the exploration of space. I don't know how I would do this, but it would somehow incorporate inspiring pieces of writing or videos for the public's viewing. The world needs something like this. No, the universe needs something like this. Who's with me?",6,0,Will B,3WzHXI5HizQ,0.1376851851851852,2014-05-15 05:20:15,True,True

2014-05-16T18:46:56,"Thought this might help answer some peoples questions:  Interstellar is a movie by Director, Christopher Nolan (Inception, Dark Night Trilogy).  Mainly based on the scientific theories and script treatment of renowned theoretical physicist, Kip Thorne. Interstellar is set to be released in November 7, 2014.  Nolan and Emma Thomas are producing with Lynda Obst, and Jordan Goldberg is exec producing. Obst commissioned the original treatment and Steven Spielberg came aboard in 2006, when Paramount owned DreamWorks and after the filmmaker became intrigued by Caltech physicist and relativity expert Kip S. Thorne and his scientific theory that wormholes exist and can be used for time travel. Spielberg set Jonah Nolan to write the script, which made it easy for Christopher Nolan to come aboard after Spielberg left the project. The ambition is that Interstellar will depict a heroic voyage to the farthest borders of our scientific understanding.  The film is co-finaced by Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Entertainment. In coming to a deal with its rival studio, Warners, which maintains an overall deal with Nolan's Syncopy label, relinquished to Paramount its rights to co-finance the next Friday the 13th horror film as well as a potential future South Park movie, which are two properties that were originally owned by Paramount before being brought by Warners. Also included in the negotiations was an agreement to let Paramount co-finance a to-be-determined A-list Warners property",0,0,balex2012usa,3WzHXI5HizQ,0.14615384615384613,2014-05-16 18:46:56,True,True
