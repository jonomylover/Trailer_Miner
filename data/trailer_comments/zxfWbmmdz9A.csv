WHAT I SAW IN THIS FILM THAT WOULD NEVER REVEAL WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO LIVED THROUGH THE REALITY , IS SOMEONE WHO AFTER FACING THE FACT THAT HE HAD NOTHING AT ALL, THAT HE HAD NO MONEY TO EVEN PAY FOR A PRIVATE ROOM FOR HIS SON.... FOUND HIS WAY BACK FROM MARS. ALONG WITH MANY MORE WHO FELT THEY OWNED MORE THAN THEY HAD AND THAT NO MATTER HOW RIGHT THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG THAN TWO LEFT SHOES",0,0,LINDA GOINS,zxfWbmmdz9A,0.14349206349206348,2020-02-29 02:40:43,False,False

2020-03-08T00:29:22,I just watched this film yesterday with my mother who was born in 1961. We both never heard of this story. This film we both loved and it was somewhat educating by teaching us the legacy of Ann Atwater and C.P Ellis. The fact that a Klan's leader and an African American woman became friends under very unlikely circumstances in their time and changed North Carolina's history regarding school integration is a story that must be brought to light.,0,0,Shiesha Covington,zxfWbmmdz9A,0.09,2020-03-08 00:29:22,False,False
