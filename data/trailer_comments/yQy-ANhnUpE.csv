Abrams called this a ""blood relative"" to the original Cloverfield movie. In this case this movie could be in the same universe, But it could've happened on the other side of the US or the world so it didn't hit there, hence the iPhone 6 she is holding. This can indeed take place 8 years later no problem and if they do want this to go the direction of a direct squeal (different place 8 years later) or indirect (whatever they want, same universe)  Basically we don't need to speculate or argue about the movie that isn't out yet because Abrams can go either way with this movie and it can make since.

2016-01-27T21:59:12,"okay so from what i see During the Cloverfield incident John Goodmans character had found out the monster was in NY and decided to take take cover in a bunker he already had in place, he was probably one of those people who had an apocalyptic bunker anyway so what better time to use it than during Cloverfield. My guess is that when the incident happen his children were much younger and didnt know what was going on so he created some lie like we have to go on a vacation or something.. the kids got older and he found it difficult to keep coming up with reasons as to why they needed to stay in the house so instead he just threatens them and beats them anytime they attempt to leave versus telling them the truth that the world had been taken over by alien monsters because he felt if he told them that they would not believe him and they would have left the bunker sooner, thus dying sooner....then you might say well they have technology why didn't he just show them on the news what happened..well one the networks are probably down given the current tragedy, who has time to depict the news from a set location with the world is overrun with man eating monsters...well what about a radio? Maybe he just didn't want them to know, so they wouldn't freak out even more..freaking out from not being able to leave the house ever is way different from freaking out because you know the whole world around you is apocalyptic....also he didn't have a radio or tv so he couldn't  have showed them even if he wanted too, which was stupid, because without at least a radio how would you know whether or the problem is resolved or be able to notify someone that you are alive and need assistance....assuming government officials and the military are alive",0,0,TheRealArrendondo,yQy-ANhnUpE,0.025617283950617298,2016-01-27 21:59:12,True,True

Porque si es continuación de la anterior la ciudad de New York fue destruida porque el gobierno implemento el Protocolo del Martillo el cual implica el uso de sus propias armas nucleares sobre territorio Estadounidense, Ademas si el sujeto del bunker es un preppers el cual ya esta preparado con anterioridad para un desastre natural o una guerra nuclear inclusive este tipo una ves que se encierre bajo tierra en su bunker no sale a la superficie por nada ni que llegue papa noel y le traiga una coca cola bien fría ni por la mejor marihuana de Colombia.

We couldn't even get to see Cloverfield itself all we saw was 2 damn monsters that came out of nowhere and nearly killed Michelle.
