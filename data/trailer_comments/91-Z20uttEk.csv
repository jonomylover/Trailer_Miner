And yes, I'm completely aware of the idea of simply waiting for the movie to come out, but I look at doing this as a way to save money based on watching trailers alone. And yes, this comment is EXTREMELY long, so its up to you to continue reading.  Takes place present day. Music and style feels 80s, but cellphones are seen throughout, so definitely after the events of the first film which took place in South Carolina. A family of four decide to stay at a seemingly dilapidated trailer park near Gaglin Lake in Florida to visit family, and find nothing out of the ordinary about it being COMPLETELY empty. ""I think everybody leaves after Labor Day"" the mom says. Okay, sure, but where are the family members you came to visit? And you're going to gloss over the fact there's food already in the fridge of the house that is supposed to be vacant? So the Strangers murdered EVERYONE in the trailer park before this family's arrival, their bodies will possibly be discovered throughout, and its just pure coincidence of this family's arrival.   So, somehow the father and son get separated from the mother and daughter. They probably go out to check the rest of the park to figure out the deal of the Dollface girl and see if there's anyone else there. Dollface comes back and traps mother and daughter in bathroom. Daughter gets out through sunroof while the Mom either gets brutally murdered, or disappears. Father, son and daughter hideout in another abandoned trailer home, where father finds revolver to attack Strangers. A cop, who comes by to check out the place every now and then, shows up to find it deserted, and the Dad will accidentally kill the cop. So the Dad goes outside with gun to get to cop's car and/or deal with Strangers, either to get brutally murdered, or disappear.  Man in Mask crashes truck through home, forcing brother and sister to run and hide out.  Brother distracts Man in Mask to follow him to pool while sister hides in tunnel. Brother stabs the Man in Mask at pool,  but either gets brutally murdered or disappears. Pin Up Girl and Dollface, meanwhile, find sister in tunnel and force her out. Sister hides in police car, but Man in Mask, not dead from stab wound, comes back with truck and rams into it repeatedly to force her out, and causes an explosion. The Man in Mask, still in truck that is now on fire, continues to advance towards the bloodied Sister.   Now, the conclusion. Either A) Family gets murdered one by one until the sister is left to fend for herself, and she either lives or dies while the Strangers continue on to kill another day. Or B) the Sister is knocked unconscious, and wakes up to a scene similar to the first film, where her and her family are one by one brutally murdered by the Strangers. Either way, most of the family wind up dead, but the film might have a cheap mid-credit scene with Liv Tyler from the first one coming in back in hopes to get funding for a third in which she gets revenge.",0,0,ZWKA1,91-Z20uttEk,-0.007812500000000003,2018-01-07 05:14:30,True,True

Clearly, based upon the constraints of said lore, the killers cannot fail; the story will not allow it. As such, it's pretty damn clear how this movie ends, and that is reason enough to not watch it, let alone have any need to watch it.  Furthermore, this movie is mudding the general lore too much.

It still remains one of the most intense horror movies I have ever seen. The great thing about the first was the randomness of the crime and how they just stab them and walk away.

Why not have the son just shoot the dad and end his misery?! 3rd dumb thing, why didn't the son shoot that masked female attacker. That said, this movie, like the original still was scary and gory, try watching it at night alone or at night in the theater!

Ya, also lets not go to the side of vehicles that are trying to run us over... because trucks can definitely drive sideways. Speaking of trucks, why is a 1975 Ford pickup invincible? After all the ramming of the SUV, which is enough to kill the truck because older vehicles are terrible in crash ratings and impacts, but the explosion would certainly melt the rubber distributor cap and spark plug wires immediately, causing the truck to die in 2 seconds.
