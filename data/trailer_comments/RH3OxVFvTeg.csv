This trailer however has forced me to at the very least reconsider that stance. I'm still not completely convinced to see this film and being that this is the final trailer I guess the only thing I can do at this point is wait for the Rotten Tomatoes score. If it's anything below 80% then I won't see it until it comes out on Redbox.

She's not overpowered, she has the exact same powers as wolverine (except that she only has two claws in her hands and one in the foot) she however doesn't have any morals unlike wolverine (sorta) has. She looks just as powerful here as in the comic to me and I can't wait to finally see her and I'm so excited that her first appearance is gonna be in an r-rated movie! To all the people saying that she has no flaws and is perfect bc that's how every female character is written in Hollywood, she has huge flaws.

2017-01-22T01:40:58,"Schwarzenegger is the Terminator. Stallone is Rocky and Rambo. Christopher Reeve was Superman. Patrick Stewart (for me) is professor X. Ian McKellen is Gandalf. Jeff Goldblum is Dr. Ian Malcolm. Sam Neill is Dr. Alan Grant. Hugh Jackman IS the Wolverine now and forever. The actors and their roles that marked my childhood (and a bit later than that). Sometimes i even refer to them with their role's name. For example, there is no Jeff Goldblum for me. Whenever i want to refer to him, i just use the name Ian Malcolm. :P Also, i owe a big thanks to the person that first considered Hugh Jackman for the role of the Wolverine and a much bigger thanks to Hugh himself for filling almost two decades of my life with pure awesomeness.  Update: The list can go on and on, but as you may see, i started with the two most iconic characters in the history of cinema (no one can deny that about Arnold and Sylvester) and kept on with my own personal favorites. You people have mentioned many many more, but our age is different, we were ""raised"" by different movies and actors and from what i see in the comments, i should have included Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley. I surely agree to that. Now because as i said, our ages differ, as kids me and you, have seen different movies. Now a child, correlates the actor he sees on TV, for the first time, with the role that the actor plays in that first time. For example, the first time i saw Arnold, was on Terminator. And i was just a little kid back then. I correlated the actor and the role so strongly, that i actually thought Arnold was a robot :P I can't do that with RDJ as Iron Man. But i can do that with  Gandalf, because even though i was 15 when the first came out, Ian McKellen in the grey mage suit was so intimate to me that i immediately merged actor and role into one in my mind. If i was a kid i'm sure it would happen with RDJ too. Definitely.  Talking about Arnold and robots, Robocop, played by Peter Weller is another iconic combination for me. For example i just can't think of anyone else playing as Robocop. I simply can't. I can't accept it. Also, Lou Ferrigno. Boy oh boy. I guess you know what i'm gonna say huh? Hulk of course. How could i forget that? See? I'm pretty sure many of you didn't even know that.

The fact the ""bad guys"" (the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce) only send one guy in with cuffs to capture Laura (X-23), and the way he just walks up to her, leads me to believe they *expected* to be able to easily control her once they found her. The rest of the gang are just standing around outside waiting. This theory of mine is also supported by the way Donald Pierce says ""no"".  Watch his demeanor. The first time he says, ""no"", he confidently expects her to obey him, like he's commanding a trained dog. (And she, no doubt, was raised like a trained dog, before she escaped.)

The movie was excellent in every aspect. The actors/actresses performances, the production design, the video/audio editing and visual effects. Everything seemed shockingly realistic. As for the violence, I've never experienced such level of violence and gore in any super-hero movie in my entire life. Not even Deadpool. The amount of violence, fights and depression makes me almost sad while watching it. I'm not saying the movie doesn't have funny parts, it does have. I'm just saying that I've never saw Logan and Professor X in this dark situation before. The whole movie was dark and intense makes you think all the time that something bad will happen to our favorite characters.  But as I promised, I will not reveal any storylines. BUT... you should know that in the end of the movie, you will shed tears... as I did.  If this movie doesn't get an Academy Award, then they're doing these super-hero movies injustice. At least, AT LEAST, give Hugh Jackman an Academy Honorary Award for all those years of portraying the character. The 'Logan' movie alone is worth an Oscar. Jackman made an outstanding and jaw dropping performance.",33,0,King Laith,RH3OxVFvTeg,0.04333333333333335,2017-03-02 21:08:19,False,True

That's not the worst thing in the world..  At least it's a different take on it.  The second thing I noticed,  although you might miss it if you're not looking for it..  is the extreme over the top political correctness in the film.  I mean I get it - it's Hollywood,  Hugh Jackman is a big leftie.. etc. etc.  But to give you an idea of how far they take it,  literally EVERY white person in the film is evil, selfish,  bad, etc.  and EVERY non-white person is pure, innocent,  good,  and so forth.

This film got rave reviews. Don't know why. It is about personal case I guess. Some good bits but not something I would go and buy and with a ticket in London costing about ¬£15, it isn't cheap either so you need to be selective.

BUT  * At the  beginning of The Wolverine it shows that he was a POW in WW2 and years  later goes to Japan to meet the soldier that tried to free him.  My  question is...........if he lost his memory after the vietnam war (  Origins:Wolverine and well after WW2 ) how does he remember the soldier  and where he was kept prisoner? I though he lost his memories?  *  At the end of X-men: First class, a young professor X gets crippled from  a bullet , but at the end of Origins: Wolverine, he is older and yet he  is standing by the helicopter waiting for the mutants and in X-men 3 he  is walking fine into young Jean Grey's house?",1,0,Allan Roodt,RH3OxVFvTeg,0.10757575757575757,2017-06-26 00:18:15,False,False
