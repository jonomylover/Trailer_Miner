I have not a doubt but he, Whosoe'er the man might be, Who the first with pointed rays, (Workman worthy to be sainted) Set the Sign-board in a blaze, When the risen sun he painted, Took the fancy from a glance At thy glittering countenance.  Soon as gentle breezes bring News of winter's vanishing, And the children build their bowers, Sticking 'kerchief-plots of mold All about with full-blown flowers, Thick as sheep in shepherd's fold! With the proudest Thou art there, Mantling in the tiny square.  Often have I sigh'd to measure By myself a lonely pleasure; Sigh'd to think, I read a book Only read perhaps by me; Yet I long could overlook Thy bright coronet and Thee, And thy arch and wily ways, And thy store of other praise.  Blithe of heart, from week to week Thou dost play at hide-and-seek; While the patient Primrose sits Like a Beggar in the cold, Thou, a Flower of wiser wits, Slipp'st into thy shelter'd hold: Bright as any of the train When ye all are out again.  Thou art not beyond the moon, But a thing ""beneath our shoon;"" Let, as old Magellen did, Others roam about the sea; Build who will a pyramid; Praise it is enough for me, If there be but three or four Who will love my little Flower",0,0,THE CANCERFEST,Cgnk3MLw9TM,0.11553030303030302,2018-01-08 17:03:13,True,True

2018-04-05T05:55:15,If y'all want some SPOILERS from someone who watched the advanced screening click read more . . . . . . . The main girl and her best friend are the only two left at the end of the movie and they spread the game to the whole world so that everyone has to play the game so that they have more time before it comes back to their turn. Every other minor character (her friends) die from the demon who is controlling the game. Basically the game started because a bunch of church girls in the 1900's called upon a demon because the priest of the church was a pedophile so they called the demon to kill the priest but the demon stayed and played a game with the girls. The girls finally ended it by performing a ritual but the demon was awoken when a group of friends party in the church and destroy the pot holding the demon. Once it was released the demon played truth or dare with the college kids and thats where truth or dare came in. That group was forced to do either tell the truth or do a dare. If they didn't they would die. One of the last dares for one of the dudes was to recruit a new group of kids to play the game which is where the main character and her friends come into the game. They do everything the can but they all die except for the main girl and her best friend who spread the game to the world by asking them truth or dare on Youtube essentially making them part of the game and adding millions of players to the game and making it so that they have time before its their turn to play again,0,1,Audio Empire,Cgnk3MLw9TM,-0.014621212121212146,2018-04-05 05:55:15,True,True

Then the other girl got asked truth or dare and she chose dare but she didn‚Äôt do it so Olivia could ask the demon truth or dare. The demon chose truth because he could. BUT i think before the other e dare the person before him chose dare. so if he chose truth and then answered it he would have lived. if the other girl chose truth and didn‚Äôt do it she would be possessed  then olivia could have asked the demon truth or dare AND THE DEMON WOULD HAVE HAD TO CHOOSE DARE so olivia could have dared it to close the game...

Oh, and tube feed him, so he can't choose to die.  The monster can't kill the victim via just stopping his heart -- he has to physically kill himself (like purposely stabbing himself).

So much good things and bad things every second. Alot of plot twist going on. Like you'd try and predict what gonna happen but Movie just has so much plot twist. Overall it just so amazing this honestly  should of been top box office. Never in my life I seen movie that has so much plot twist good and bad thru out whole movie that actually makes so much sense.    I legit recommend anyone to watch this movie. I was really skeptical about it cause Normally before I watch movie I watch trailer first  than read comments to see if it worth to watch. And once again this is another movie I see so much bad comments but when I watch it the movie is just so amazing. My advice if you see trailer or heard of movie that seems intresting to you. Just ignore the reviews and give it shot. I rely on comments to much for the Power Rangers. The Wall. Quite Place and alot of other movies. All bad reviews till I watched it and I Loved it!! So please if you're intrested in something just give it a shot regardless  if it has bad or good reviews because at the end of the day we have millions of people on the planet and were all not gonna agree on same thing!

To my knowledge, none of them died from not answering, it gave them time to answer, like it haunted them until they did. So, why did Lucas answer straight away in the mission? All he had to do was ignore it long enough for the ritual to be done, they all did. The worst it did was burn letters into Lucas' arm lol, surely they could have put up with that for a couple of minutes. Maybe I'm missing something.

That is also reasonable to watch a movie hoping it will be ok at best, when at the same time it takes you through some tension and fear. Like riding a kids roller coaster, you wont say no for that fun ride, if it wont cost you extra.   So, I‚Äôm speaking to those who have that basic understanding, usually 25+.  This movie is trash.
