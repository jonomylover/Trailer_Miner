So many people (mostly the young, uneducated and moronic ones) act like racism dividing the country is something new when it's been going on ever since slavery was abolished. I hate racism. It's so common that it's like it's in some people's DNA to just naturally dislike people of another race. Some people are racist and don't even realize it. I'll admit that there's been times when I'm sitting in my car and a black guy is walking by and I find myself reaching over to lock my car doors & I have to stop to tell myself that not every African American is a criminal. It makes me sad. Unfortunately that's just the way the world is and people can protest day and night for the next 200 years and it will NEVER end.

I mean i could be assuming but it kind of seems like you only wish to be shown in a certain way...There are all these books filled with bias stories on what happened in history, so many so many water washed truth of what happened and how that are shoved down the throat of the young in school.

By opening it with Dismukes's interrogation and by framing it around his account, the film seems like it'll do the same by having him be the lead and having this be a framing device. It isn't, and he doesn't have much of a focus/presence in the film itself, though none of the actors really do (BTW I liked the film overall, but I would have preferred it if it was better advertised)",0,0,Hopingover Leavesinfall,s-2_1tUnIWM,0.31875,2017-09-21 22:01:24,False,True

Next, they should make  a movie about Chicago, & try to slant the blame for that to the  wrong side...as usual.  I heard Detroit was enriching their community with art. Then I looked at  what their idea of art is. Old lady dresses hanging from trees, &  graffiti all over the place. Enriching it with art? According to who???  It's a fucking joke.  The cost for the film was more than the cost of Detroit itself. Lol...Talk  about priorities. They don't want people looking at statistics. They'd rather keep people stupid, & appeal to their emotions with propaganda. Take responsibility for your own failure.
