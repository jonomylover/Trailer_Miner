2015-01-10T16:13:54,"So, heres what I got from the trailer about the plot.  Geek A wants to make a sentient robot, and he does this by making a robotic police force. Well, thats pretty damned unethical to begin with as not even the most paranoid dreams of Orwell or wettest dreams of Stalin could ever conceive such a thing. A robotic police force (terminator cops) seems like its ripe for abuse, a dictator could come in and turn these machines on people, thus enslaving them.  Veteran B wants to make giant war machines/mechs, and this is ""somehow"" slightly better because its controlled by a human. Nothing says freedom like cops using armored mechs armed with beltfed 40 mm grenade launchers, heavy machineguns, and anti-tank rockets. And people bitch about cops using tasers and shooting and harassing people.  How about dont build these devices and everybody learn to love and respect each others decisions in life? I mean really, if the cops are going to use terminators (thats what Chappie is) and giant mechs then as far as I'm concerned I'm going to pickup a half dozen AT-4's and a boatload of grenade launchers. I mean really, if I dont need a so called ""assualt rifle"" to protect myself, why would they need giant mechs and terminators?  Behind the veil of the plot being what constitutes life, I see this as a dystopian where everybody is oppressed/enslaved by killer terminators and mobile suits.

Assuming that robots if programmed to be specific and correct in language shouldn't speak with a given accent of one culture and taught another language.

Just because the robot was made 'artificially' or out of metal does not mean that it's an abomination marked for death.   Seriously. Women create life all the time. In the womb. Us humans are basically really complicated machines as well, only our components are based down to the molecular level compared to the macro level of a mechanical robot. Carbon or alloy, this is something that displays the charcteristics of life.  What are the characteristics of life? Cells, levels of organization, uses energy, responds to surroundings, growth, and reproduction. (Anyone who says that all life must be made of carbon is shallow minded) -A robot can be viewed as a giant cell. It carries all functions it needs to survive in one package. Without its servos, it's an immobile mess and cannot survive. -Each of its component are a level of organization. Whether that be locomotion, mental processing, sensory systems, anything. -They require an input of energy to operate. Pretty much anything that moves need this. -They can and will respond to stimuli.  -They don't technically have a meants for physical growth but that does not mean that mental growth can be counted out as well. -And just because they don't have a self cotained means of reproducing does not atuomatically state that they can't simply build another one of their kind.    What pisses me off is how antagonist humans in stories like these are way too shallow minded to look past the metal and wire and into the consciousness that is really what makes people... people!

I thought it would be okay for my younger brother to watch (who's 14) but boy was I wrong.

Now, I was really intrigued with the idea of having robots as a police force, and having a robot with emotions, even if that idea has been done millions of times. But the film squanders from poor character development, being less consistent to the message of the film, and not a whole lot of chemistry from Chappie and that guy from Slumdog Millionaire, forgive me for not knowing his name. With that said, I did enjoy the visual effects and acting, especially with Hugh Jackman's performance because he looked like he was having fun with his villain role, and it was so over the top that it was actually pretty entertaining. So overall, I don't hate it, I just wish that it was as promising as the trailers. And for those who like it, or even love it, then love it as you will.

And it doesn't  go for a documentary  look like District  9.   Chappie  himself  is EXTREMELY  likable.   The other characters  are somewhat  annoying. Hugh Jackman starts off great as a bully. But then, later on the movie he comes off as a Jesus  freak. He literally  calls Chappie  a godless  whatever.   It irked  me alot. And I'm  not even a Christian. Visual effects are great. Hans  Zimmer  sound  Track complements the movie. The end is very wishy-washy. It's a 2 hour long movie . I guess it just needed to end. Compared to Blomkamps  previous  films, this movie is more uplifting.   For Americans, those south African  accents  are going to sound really weird. Hopefully, this will be Blomkamps  final  south African, dystopian - future movie. Because  it's safe to say he has exhausted  his visual bag of tricks. I still think he has a good eye for visual effects. I wouldn't  mind a Halo movie  or a transformers  movie from him.   Also, he is not much of a writer.

Extremely predictable (except for one thing near the end that really sent my eyebrow thru the roof) and with some big hard-to-ignore inconsistencies... but after all it's supposed to be a homage to Short Circuit and other similar old-timey 'cpu comes alive' movies, and i found it passable at that. Chappie as a character is UNBEARABLE in his infancy, but quickly becomes quite likeable.  Can't tell if Wolverine's ridicolously exaggerated portrayal of a militaristic, religious nut is either intentional or the result of laughably incompetent script. I mean, how retarded it is to genuinely believe cops would need anti-air armament and cluster bombs to deal with street crime? How did someone like that end up developing cybernetics?!  Also, is Neil Blonkamp ever going to have an antagonist that doesn't incarnate the worst side of militarism? We get it, war is bad. Please mature a bit in the next movie.  Finally, don't know why Sigourney Weaver even bothered to get out of bed for this. But then again she did stuff like ""the cold light of day"" recently, so this is a massive improvement.

2015-07-10T12:14:46,"Blomkamp,  movies attempt to examine heady topics such as what does it actually mean to be human, the nature of consciousness, and so forth. Since District 9, he's essentially used the same formula for each of his movies however. Their strong points are an attempt to examine interesting topics that make you think (vs just CGI and explosions, etc), great characters, and unique visuals.  The weak points is a serious need for the suspension of disbelief where physical, technical, and plot line issues are ignored in favor of the ""big picture"" topics (pretty much the same for each movie however...) he wants to examine that makes what could be a great movie, an OK movie. If you enjoyed District 9 and  Elysium, you'll enjoy Chappie. If you didn't enjoy those movies, Chappie is more of the same from Blomkamp. For me District 9 by far his best movie, and he's been unable to re capture that magic of District 9 ever since. I liked Chappie more than Elysium at least, but it's time Blomkamp found a new formula as he's becoming very predictable. The ending of Chappie seems to take right from Robo Cop. Not sure if that was intentional or a mistake, but I thought it was very Robo Cop (talk about a great movie!) esk at the end.

I was personally amazed how he approached this subject, it felt fresh, inovative and really funny for a dystopian sci-fi. CHAPPIE was excellently developed as a character who learns about life, people, human values, relationships and the nature of good and bad. I cared abot him and was interested where it was going. Supporting cast took a backseat here as diverse people who form his character and it worked. I also thought that movie mixed action , drama, humour - it is very funny movie by the way very well and for the 2 hour runtime it just flies by. I also really liked the message it sends. Humans are selfish and will always look for a way to exploit everything they can for their own benefit. Yes, some people might be annoyed by over the top villains and some plot hole here and there, but looking at it overall Chappie delivered big time.

In fact, everything was fine, until the programmer had to fuck it all up. But it's a movie, and movies need conflict. I get that. But surely they could have actually made the bots oppressive, creating a much more understandable conflict, and cutting out all the stupid gangster crap. If they had done this, the movie would have been so much more justifiable, and have the potential for a better ending. About that later. On to another problem. Too much of this movie was spent trying to make me care about a band of street ""gangsters"" so that I felt something when they were slaughtered by the world's worst marketed weapon. Seriously, a character made a mech with clusterbombs, anti-air missiles, a minigun, etc., and tried to sell it to a police force in South Africa. They failed miserably (the gangsters). Anyway, watch as the robot, Chappie, who had so much potential to be an interesting character, turn into an overly annoying Hollywood-ified ""gangster"" to match the ones the movie spends about 70% of it's time on. And in the end, witness the most open and meaningless ending ever. There's nothing to spoil, so I'll just do it. The maker dies, chappie figures out consciousness, transitions them both into robot bodies, the gangsters are killed (thankfully) and chappie and his maker run away. That's it. The whole movie was basically meaningless. That's my rant over. CONDITIONS FOR COMMENTING: READ THIS. THE WHOLE THING.

2016-01-17T16:14:27,"Matthew's Movie Madness  ""Chappie"" (2015) RATING: 8/10  A ghetto robot that can think and feel for himself kicks ass, takes names, and fights Hugh Jackman for 2 hours. How shocked I was to learn that this movie was so much more than that.  ""Chappie"" is the third and most recent film from ""District 9"" director Neill Blomkamp, co-written with his wife Terri Thatchel, and co-produced by Simon Kinberg (X-MEN: Days of Future Past). Boy, was I fooled big time by the 31% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Who was truly right, this whole time, was the audience. Bless those who spoke the truth.  With an excellent score by Hans Zimmer, Blomkamp directs this science fiction action-thriller almost flawlessly. And for those who see no real character development, just look at Chappie. Played by Blomkamps longtime friend Sharlto Copley in performance capture and voice, HE is the character we should really recognize. Dramatic, funny, and all-powerful, his performance gives this story meaning. A robot that learns to exist in the real world, and by the end of the film, doesn't even feel like a robot at all. Dav Patel plays Deon, Chappie's creator, with realism, and that's all it takes. Sigourney Weaver makes an even stronger performance, and Hugh Jackman plays a cold-hearted, moral-free villain with charisma and confidence, and what's unique is in the end, he gets his in a way I would never have expected. A great cast for a great movie.  Don't let the critics fool you all on this one. Blomkamp DOES have a promising career ahead of him, as long as he continues to do what he does best: action movies with character, originality, and confidence. An ace movie, and one of the best films of 2015.",0,0,Matthew Minor,lyy7y0QOK-0,0.2606684981684982,2016-01-17 16:14:27,False,False

2018-01-29T23:09:43,I thought this movie was very touching and it's better if you know Die Antwoord already. I feel like maybe some of the funnier more light-hearted bits were maybe edited out. It got really dramatic and heart-wrenching so I think maybe a bit more comedy and quirk from Yolandi and Ninja would help round it out more and also help show their relationship even more. Maybe slow the pacing down in some parts a little bit. That would be especially helpful if you weren't already familiar with their characters. But I liked it a lot! Very entertaining.
