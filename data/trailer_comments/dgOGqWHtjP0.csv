I am back to reading the last couple of years as every time they talk about some great movie you go watch and come out very disappointed. Special effects are great these days so no reason they can't make great movies. That piece of garbage Fantastic Beasts and where to find them was an insult to anyone that paid to watch it and yes I was insulted as were my Grand children.  Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was another terrible movie that was a waste of time and money. It's like they just don't give a damn any more as TV series are now better than movies.
