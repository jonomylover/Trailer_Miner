If it is an obviously-monster-movie I want at longest 10 minutes reaching the monster, another 10 minutes hinting the monster. Then the Hunt shall begin. No teasing. No maybe. No shakycam. Bring me Teh Monster! Hide the thing by out of camera, by shadows, by covers, by invisibility if you must, by FPS-view, but make the monster not a possible threat, a maybe, but an actual one! OR don't make a monster until the ending! Make the viewer believe the kid has a worsening condition! Key to this is do NOT reveal it is a monster in the trailer! The hardest pass would of course be showing it is a monster, but for final reveal in a believable way it was actually just the kid's condition, but than that possibility must remain open to a degree (that's the hard part).
