Nagumo, since I failed to get shot down by flying between the American battleships I chose to get decapitated by a telephone wire.""  1:35 That actually happened, but the aircraft is wrong. On 1 February 1942 USS Enterprise was on a raiding mission against the Marshall Islands when a flight of five Mitsubishi G4M bombers attacked. (The movie shows them incorrectly to be G3M Nells.) All their bombs missed and several ""Bettys"" were hit by Enterprise's AA gunfire. One wounded G4M turned back and made a suicide dive toward the American carrier. Seeing the danger Aviation Machinist Mate 3rd Class Bruno Peter Gaido manned the rear seat gun position of a parked SBD Dauntless and opened fire on the enemy plane. His shooting caused the ""Betty"" to go out of control and miss the carrier, however, its wing sliced right through the fuselage of the SBD manned by AMM3 Gaido. Rear-Admiral Wm. Halsey personally promoted Gaido for his courage and decisive action. Months later during the Battle of Midway (4 June 1942), Bruno Gaido served as the radioman-gunner of an SBD flown by Ensign Frank O'Flaherty which participated in the attack which fatally incinerated three Japanese aircraft carriers. While returning from the mission O'Flaherty and Gaido were forced to ditch their plane for lack of fuel. Both men escaped the sinking plane and got into a liferaft only to be captured by a Japanese destroy.

While I can understand the attempt to make it more interesting, that does not mean adding more explosions, inane dialogue, horrendous CGI, and blatant impossibilities. What directors fail to understand is that the history itself is entertaining enough! It had enough joys, sorrows, drama, and action for a whole generation of people without being mutilated to try and make it cool!   A short list of amazing true events that will probably never feature in this travesty:   -Yorktown came into Pearl Harbor just before the battle heavily damaged from the previous engagement in the Coral Sea and they worked day and night to get her repaired and underway in two days when the original repair time was months. -During the Japanese attack on Midway, the US Marine contingent performed the daily flag-raising ceremony while bombs were exploding everywhere. (See the original Battle of Midway film, taken from footage captured by the on-site journalist who was, by the way, wounded by shrapnel while filming a hangar exploding.) -After the Yorktown was abandoned due to multiple torpedo and bomb hits, a sailor with his guts torn up by shrapnel, forgotten in sickbay, somehow climbed three decks up, across the severely slanting deck, and fired a machine gun burst at a nearby destroyer to get their attention. When men arrived, he told them there was another wounded man down in sickbay. This sailor later died of his injuries, but he saved the life of his comrade, who had a fractured skull but eventually recovered. -When one of the Japanese carriers was being abandoned, the crew determined to save their captain from going down with the ship in spite of himself and sent a Navy wrestling champion to bring him down off the bridge. The sailor came up, saluted, and informed his captain that they were waiting for him. After receiving no reply, he advanced to pick him up but the captain turned around and the look on his face stopped the sailor in his tracks. The sailor then saluted again and left, tears in his eyes, hearing his captain softly singing the Japanese national anthem of the time.   See? Real human drama, heroism, stupidity, cowardice, glory, ignominy, it's all there. Don't try and make it larger than life. Let the story tell itself and tell it with practical, no-nonsense effects as much as possible. (We don't have any period aircraft carriers left, so CGI in the distance shots is unavoidable, but for close-ups, please, none of that.) Sorry. Had to rant about this mess. Anyone who's interested in hearing the whole story can find a good telling of it in the book Miracle at Midway, or hop over to Montemayor's covering of the first part of the fight here on Youtube for an excellent summary.",1632,127,ZakCrimsonleaf1,BfTYY_pac8o,0.06724290780141844,2019-09-18 02:23:48,True,True

That way, our brains had that point of reference for the planes, then just didn't blink when we saw the CGI ones in the heat of the moment.  This is all CGI all the time, which confuses me a bit.  None of these classes of plane have gone anywhere.  Sure, they might not be able to get a flying Val or those modified Texans, but those Zeroes are still around (in fact the exact same planes!) and we've got flyable Dauntlesses around.  They don't need to use them for combat scenes, just have them around for work-a-day purposes to help smooth the illusion.  Or, hell, maybe just don't get that close to the models if they're that bad.  Beyond that, what these planes are doing just makes no sense.  There are resources with very basic information on these planes and their capabilities; no you don't need to be an expert in WWII air combat to know that a B5N ""Kate"" doesn't have forward firing guns.  Also, why the hell are they so low all the time?  I know they get low on strafing runs, but not that low!  Not ""I'm scraping my balls on the radio masts"" low, at least not most of the time.  And the massive formation of bombers flying at maybe five hundred feet off the deck is just silly.  I get that concessions need to be made for movies, but this isn't that.  This is taking history and hardcoring it up twelve notches because ""we gotta have our pwetty explosions.""  I do hope I'm just overreacting, I really am, but this looks like it's gonna be a second Pearl Harbor.  (And before anyone jumps on me, no Pearl Harbor isn't a good movie.  I could rant and rave about the sins of that movie for the better part of a day.  However, the visual effects were actually done with some care.  Sure, it's overdone explosion fodder, because Michael Bay, but some of it would be technically impressive even today, like that rolling battleship scene.)",0,0,AardvarkLord,BfTYY_pac8o,0.11538461538461539,2019-11-06 05:55:07,False,True

It told the story in broad strokes with not nearly enough detail to the battle. I felt it spent  unnecessary amount of time on the fate of dolittle and the Chinese people... The movie is called midway not 30 seconds over Tokyo... It never showed the counter attack on the Yorktown.  I am more than  familiar with the battle of midway and that's the only reason I was able to understand the what was going on throughout the film.. For anyone who was trying to understand or learn about the battle of midway this is not the movie to see.. The original from 1976 did a superior job  Of detailing the battle and conveyed how desperate the search for the carriers was...  In the original movie  They use a lot of war more footage and gun camera footage..

The illustrated flight physics and tactical acumen is even crappier with aircraft attacking in closed up flocks??     ¬†The Japanese aircraft weren't on deck they were below decks.  They Japanese rearmed and refuelled below deck.  That was fatal as fires started there could not be contained as the aircraft burned and ordnance stacked to the side on temporary racks exploded.  That is kind of fundamental to the story.     They are pretending they are telling THE story.  They aren't.  They just don't care.  It's garbage.
