To see rogen and franco actually make something that looks fucking hilarious again and to even touch on this subject just feels like such a fresh movie is about to be here and be one to remember. This seems like one of those that has that magic films seem to be lacking these days. Can't wait to be a new man after i see the credits hopefully this is one of those special movies that not only kills it with the humor but ultimately makes you review your own life, character and dreams to determine if you're on the right path. Either way im actually going to laugh at a movie and that's something that seems to be getting rarer these days as comedy itself is starting to change and be altered in ways that seem fake.
