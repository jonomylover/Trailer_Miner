The critical and audience feedback channels are completely corrupted at this point. You can't tell whether a movie is really good or bad until after it's been out for a week.  The studios and the Distributors taking over these feedback channels has caused me to stop being first week customer of any film.  Rotten Tomatoes is completely corrupted. Their feedback her movies only includes people who bought a ticket to the movie. This Means the audience rating is actually a rating of how good the movie is among people who already liked the movie.    This would be like saying how popular a brand of sauerkraut was among people who like sauerkraut. It doesn't tell you how popular sauerkraut is with the general public. And the Rotten Tomatoes audience score for movies no longer is useful for gauging how popular the movie is with the general public. It also has the side effect of making the audience pole have a smaller population which makes it super easy for the studios to buy a couple thousand tickets through a service and then spam the audience rating with a bunch of five star no text reviews. Or in some cases, ludicrously, five-star word for word identical reviews back to back for a couple of pages by ""different"" users.  If you wait until the second week, then you'll have a more truthful feedback on the movie and the extra benefit that more of your box office dollars will stay with your local movie theater and in your local economy.
