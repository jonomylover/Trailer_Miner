The book's got an interesting plot, I'm not sure why Disney didn't just use the book as a base to make a live action movie and use this other idea of realms to make their own unique product.  I can see elements from the ballet more than I can from the book, but maybe it's there somewhere.  I see no evidence of the mouse king.

2018-08-28T00:04:03,"I have a very NOT so jolly feeling about this movie. I first saw the Nutcracker Ballet when I was six years old with my grandmother. Ever since, it has remained a central part of my Christmas season. When I heard that it was getting made into a full length, live action film, I was very excited. I never expected this film to be EXACTLY the same as the ballet. That would have been unreasonable. What I was expecting was a well made, faithful adaptation of what is for me, a timeless Christmas story which is so closely associated with Christmas, that it could rival the story of the Birth of Christ. Then I saw these trailers. This is not the Nutcracker story. I'm confused why Disney even decided to put that word into the title, since this story being presented has almost nothing to do with the source material. Aside from a heavily distorted soundtrack and the opening setting, I could not find one reference to beloved characters such as the Nutcracker, the Mouse King, the Queen of the Suger Plum Forest, and more. The story being presented here is not the Nutcracker. At best, it's a fabricated remake of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. At worst, it's a terrible Fanfiction which has no connection or faith towards its source. If this movie was being marketed as its own, COMPLETELY ORIGINAL AND SEPERATE creation, this would not upset me so much. I'm genuinely curious as to the reasoning behind this distortion. If the movie turns out good, then I'll still enjoy it.

Such a shame to avoid a real telling of the tale of the Nutcracker. It isn't a well known story. By the sounds of the track here, it doesn't look like they're going to go beyond Sugar-Plum Fairy from Tchaikovsky, another travesty considering the wealth of music from the Ballet.

2018-09-05T06:03:44,"First, the Nutcracker was already perfectly realized in Tchaikovsky's ballet. The world certainly doesn't need Disney to come along and genericize the story to try and wring some more cash out of a beloved cultural institution. Second, including black actors in a thoroughly European story where all the characters in the original E.T.A. Hoffman story were white is tantamount to blackwashing.  You wouldn't cast white actors in a Japanese tale set in the 19th century, and just so for both historical and cultural reasons you don't cast black people to play white roles. How the media thinks it's wrong for a white actor like ScarJo to portray an Asian character in Ghost in the Shell, yet advocates that it's fair for a black actor like Idris Elba to portray a white character like James Bond, is beyond me.

And not to be left behind, the godfather of a nineteenth-century white girl turns out to be a politically correct African-American.
