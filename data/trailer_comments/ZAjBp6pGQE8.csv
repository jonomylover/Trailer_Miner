I went to it last Halloween and it really is the best time to be at these parks because you get scared on rides and than scared while walking around and the decor is bad ass but sometimes you just get annoyed by these dorks dressed up and they get a bit too close, walk behind you closey and stuff it's funny because you jump and shout because it's sometimes so sudden and you want to enjoy yourself but I feel like these dorky idiots don't get that and they legit think they can scare you sometimes like if ur annoyed after and just laughing walking away and they follow you, it's like these little gremlins are on the spectrum and socially retarded I swear. One guy followed me giving me devil eyes because he noticed I bopped a wearwolves nose as I walked by, he was just standing in the fog trying to look scary and I just pinched his nose on way by like ""Boop got ur nose"" and this little freak creeped behind me, I can't remember what he was saying but I almost wanted to smack the little fucker.
