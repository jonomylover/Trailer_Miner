Funny detail: not everybody does, even a lot of people that like the same kind of movies (action and sifi) think star wars is overrated.  Specially people that didn't watch the movies as kids and therefore don't associate them with an easier, happier moment in their lives . Moreover, the star wars cult, which is so potent in the USA, is considerably weaker, down to nonexistent, in other countries.   Meanwhile, a comedy appeals to literally everybody everywhere. I haven't yet met one single person that doesn't like to laugh.   Star wars will top on the opening weekend, that's for sure, but once the first wave of avid fans have had their turn Sisters will collect more during the showing weeks, in the international market too.
