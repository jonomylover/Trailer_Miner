Which could be referring to santa claus (saint nicholas/Sinterklaas previously).  When she's singing at some event, her family and boss are on the front row and he's nowhere to be seen. She keeps mentioning how she can't stop bumping into him, and later on how she couldn't find him. And he's never seen with anyone but kate, and every one of their scenes together they are alone. The bench scene where she tells him she's volunteering at the homeless shelter she looks kind of sad.

2019-08-15T18:09:00,"For those asking why show a Christmas movie trailer in August: Thanksgiving is celebrated in at least 9 different countries between September & November. I know in the US, it is in November & begins the ‚ÄúHoliday season ‚Äú that includes Thanksgiving, Christmas & New Year‚Äôs Day. And consider how fast this year has flown by. It‚Äôll be November/December before we know it.  Also, please stop complaining that the trailer was too long & gave away too much of the film. So what?! Don‚Äôt go see it if you don‚Äôt want to. Many of us have been waiting anxiously for this film & WILL HAPPILY go see it upon its release. Love Emilia & ESPECIALLY the music of George Michael. He approved of this movie before he passed ON CHRISTMAS DAY 2016. It also will feature one of his unreleased songs I hear, in the closing credits. For GM fans, this is a beautiful thing. Despite any & all theories on how this movie will play out or end, I‚Äôll go see it, buy it on dvd when it‚Äôs out & watch it every Christmas. Because it looks amazingly good. And calling it a Lifetime or Hallmark channel movie?! Please.  P.S: the song ‚ÄúLast Christmas ‚Äú never made it to #1 on the charts. You know why? Because that same year, George participated in the charitable song Band Aid‚Äôs ‚ÄúDo they know it‚Äôs Christmas ‚Äú for starving children in Africa. He encouraged his Wham! fans to get THAT song to #1 instead as it was for charity. Last Christmas came in at #2. Later, he had all proceeds from the ‚ÄúLast Christmas ‚Äú single donated to charity forever. I‚Äôm hoping (in honor of George & his kindness) this movie will help the song to reach #1 finally 35 years later. Perhaps Sony will release a new single of Last Christmas along with the unreleased song that‚Äôll be in this movie on the B side? This Christmas will be exactly 3 years since he‚Äôs passed. How fitting. Love you forever George.",0,0,dawntownsend,z9CEIcmWmtA,0.20189207344379761,2019-08-15 18:09:00,True,True

To be honest, this is just another move in a long line of movies that is chinese propaganda.

George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley were overdue for a complete soundtrack of their works, and even if it is dominated by George's back catalogue, Andrew played a big (and small cameo) part in bringing Last Christmas to us. Then there's Emma Thompson's screenwriting which really sparkles with her wit and intelligence, and Emilia Clarke is the perfect vehicle for it to play out on screen. She is completely genuine in this role, and all the more touching because of it. It's also just a lovely advertisement for the beauty and wonder and magic that is London, especially at night. You will NEVER have enough time to discover all of the treasures that London has in store for you.  Such a feel-good Christmas flick that rewards repeated viewings.
