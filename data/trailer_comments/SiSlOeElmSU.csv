2019-03-06T20:58:52,"Did not expect this.... At all. Um well it's certainly something. I'm just very unsure. Please tap on read more!   I mean no everyone can have their views and opinions on the movie, I don't mean to disrespect the movie at all and sure I think its great that they are being unbiased to age as to what media says is an appropriate age to do cheer-leading. That its self is a perfect and genuine concept for the movie... But at the same time, my opinion of it is I probably won't watch it. Of course it looks great but I am into action and adventure. I don't think I could ever sit down and watch a movie like this without feeling like it's missing something. Though that's just my stand on this. And I know that most of you will probably say ""Well you didn't have to comment if it's not your type of movie"" but I wanted to, also nothing I said was negative about the movie, I just wrote this because most the comments are people hyped up for this movie whereas I'd like to see if there's people who have the same mindset about this movie too. If that's the case please reply, I'd love to see peoples other opinions on this where they don't feel judged for what they have to say.
