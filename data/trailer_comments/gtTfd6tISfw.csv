2015-08-05T03:18:25,"In a fight with Wolverine I think Deadpool would totally win.  In the comics, Deadpool has a 3-1 win over Wolverine, and Wolverine only won the one time because Deadpool didn't want to fight anymore.  But we have to take a their most noticable abilities into consideration.  Wolverine Pros:  -Healing Factor - Wolverine can recover from almost any infliction in moments, depending on the severity. -Mutant Might - The combination of adamantium weight and healing gives him near peak-human strength. -Relentless Fighter - Wolverine's healing ability gives him incredible stamina. -Adamantium Skeleton - Wolverine's skeleton provides him with unbreakable bones. -Enhanced Senses - His smell and hearing are superior to a normal human's. -Adamantium Claws - His claws can slash at any surface without breaking. -Old Soul - Wolverine possesses over 100 years of experience. -Berzerker Rage - Wolverine overwhelms his opponents, relying on his healing factor to keep him going.  Wolverine Cons:  -Limited Regeneration: Wolverine doesn't heal as fast as he does in the movies, and he can't regrow limbs. -Adamantium Weight - Wolverine requires greater exertion to move with his very heavy skeleton. -Sensory Stress - Great smells and sounds can disorient Wolverine, even cause him to black out. -Attacking Blind - Wolverine rarely uses his fighting experience, going purely on instinct in battle.  Deadpool Pros:  -Hyper Regeneration - Deadpool can recover from vitually any infliction and regrow limbs in seconds, depending on the severity. -Enhanced Strength - The combination of healing and further experimentation gives him border-line super-human strength. -Restless Spirit - Deadpool's healing ability gives him incredible stamina. -Calloused Skin - His skin is constantly dying and re-growing, making Deadpool immune to conventional pain and injury. -Immortalility - Most fatal wounds will not incapacitate Deadpool, allowing him to fight as he heals. -Enhanced Abilities - Deadpool's speed and agility exceed that of even the finest human athlete. -Indescrimitory Tactics - Deadpool uses everything in his ability, on his person, or around his environment to win. -Mind Games - Deadpool's an expert of psychological combat.  Deadpool Cons:  -Emotional Healing - His healing is affected by his emotions, making him heal slower if sad/depressed or faster when happy/angry. -Mental Instability - Deadpool's psychosis makes him unpredictable, but can also hinder his own abilities.",0,0,Dante Morales,gtTfd6tISfw,0.2405376344086021,2015-08-05 03:18:25,True,True

I am sooooooooo tired of CGI taking over everything.  Just make the damn costume.  Seriously.  So I hope it won't be like that the entire movie but even of what I just saw..  Not overly impressed with that.  The writing and humour along with the action looks great but they shouldn't have CGI'd  Deadpool.  If I want to see that I'd want them to make a 3D movie or cartoon which I am sure they have already done.  I have been waiting for this cause I want to see him live action.  I'll still go watch it and it'll be great but that will be in the back of my mind the entire time I know it.  I am one of those people who doesn't like CGI that much and especially when it's unnecessary that is one of my biggest movie pet peeves.

2015-11-22T20:31:14,"Noah's are generally liked by others and care about what others think about them. Noah's usually respect others for who they are and do not try to change their surroundings and others. Noah's are usually highly sensitive people and tend to put a lot of pressure on themselves.  If dating a Noah, understand their personal space in very important to them. Even though Noah's are usually charismatic and seem to be extremely social, a Noah must have personal space more than most people.  Noah's are usually likeable due to them not trying to change, disrupt, and openly judge people for who they are and what they do.  Noah's may have a lot of friends and are well liked, but they are very selective when choosing who to surround themselves with on a consistent basis.  Noah want to make a positive impact to others and society, but they have a tendency to put too much pressure on themselves and have too many ideas and generally lose focus.  Noah's don't lose their cool very often, but then they do, watch out! Due to them consistent thinking/analyzing things, when they blow up, they tend to say very hurtful things.  Noah's seem to have a 'go with the flow"" approach, but do not be fooled. This is because Noah's tend to over-think/over-analyze things.  On the physical side/simplistic side, Noah's generally put emphasis on having great hair.  To sum it up, Noah's are charismatic, fun, highly sensitive, over-thinkers, and put a ton of pressure on themselves. Girl: So I am dating a new guy.  Girl 2: Oh Yeah. What's his name?  Girl: Noah.  Girl 2: What is he like?  Girl: He is charismatic, has great hair, seems intelligent, and seems to be free-spirited. Definitely more sensitive compared to other guys once you get to know him. Overall, most people seem to like them. But I will tell you one thing, Noah tends to over-think things and puts a lot of personal pressure on himself. He seems different than most guys, and I can't help but be drawn to him.",0,0,FaZe Jev,gtTfd6tISfw,0.24516208597603945,2015-11-22 20:31:14,True,True

2019-08-07T19:57:22,"Was a time when film FIRST came out no-one saw real ""live"" anything. It wasn't until the Spanish War Film was seen, women fainted seeing men killed, and men vomited. The question ""what powers have ran earth that desensitized humans"" the ones who want to own you, control you. New World Disorder. They took morals out, God out, Critical thinking out and put conditioning in, self serving in, disassociation in, greed in, perversions in, family out, drugs in, all family units out. Division in, indoctrination in, paranoia in. They need you so dumbed down you will take their ""freebies of lies to promise you the world"" to vote for them- to ruin and own you. So... you do not get this now. But like a five year old that turned twenty you will get it ...you will understand it...and you will say I was some dumb f%#%.
