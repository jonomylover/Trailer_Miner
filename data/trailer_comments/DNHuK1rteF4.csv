At that range shells don't get a full arming period in flight and don't get as much speed and own power. Plus there are 2 spots to kill a tiger the rear (obvious) and a 5 inch gap between the turret and the hull which allows the turret to rotate more efficiently.

2015-01-13T20:19:14," A highly enjoyable action war movie with great depth.  Some of the battle action is not realistic but this does not detract from the deeper massage.  “Ideals are peaceful, history is violent” states Don Collier (played by Brad Pitt) as he takes a new crew member under his wing. However it is this Norman Ellison played by Logan Lerman who is really the central character in this movie.  Conscience hits the reality of war, as a Norman young inexperienced American, suddenly takes the role as machine gunner in a US Sherman tank nicknamed Fury in the dying throws of Nazi Germany. Powerless and hardly believing where he is Norman cries, “I have never even seen the inside of a tank”. Movement, power, brutality and destruction follow the tracks of the steel tank, as all hell breaks loose.  This film is called “Heart of Steel or “Herz aus Stahl” in Germany and this name is very appropriate. Within the few days of combat in the heart of Germany, Norman goes from someone prepared to die, rather than execute captured SS soldiers, to a furious, hard hearted killing machine. As he quickly learns, it is not quite as simple as “kill or be killed”. If he does not kill quickly, his crew members could easily be those which will quickly die. If you are looking for much more depth than just an action packed war movie, then this is for you. Every moment life changing decisions are presented. While the moral conflict rages all around him, it penetrates and grasps his heart. As the movie ends, he survives only through the mercy of an SS soldier. Deep in thought he weighs his soft heart at the beginning of the film and his hard heart at the end. The path his heart took seems almost unreal but the film makes it seem logical and plausible.  The deeper issue of idealism and realism is the heart of this story. Should an idealistic person such as Norman act on moral principles or as most others, act on interests. Ideals without power to put them in practice are shown to be empty but power alone is seen to be brutal. It is said that realism and idealism are different sides of power and must be used together with both heart and discernment. The main characters struggle with this moral conflict. This dark world shows that a man who understands both reality and morality is rare.  I couldn’t stop talking and thinking about this movie for days. Yes the action is not always realistic as many have pointed out but I think the message comes across powerfully. Ultimately you are drawn to ask,  “How would I have decided in his situation?”  The nearest way I can think of to experience this at home today, is if you have the courage to play a Moral Conflict WWII strategy board game! Playford Games beckons you, just like Norman to make decisions not just in real fast paced action but on their path of the heart.  Could this help to understand how Norman made his choices in Fury, instead of to swiftly condemn him?",32,2,David Stennett,DNHuK1rteF4,0.0640146017504508,2015-01-13 20:19:14,False,True

2015-08-22T01:30:02,"To me, this movie is subliminal anti-american for every viewer with at least a little piece of humanity. Not mentioning the up to zero realism of the movie. In April 1945, germany was completly beaten. Allies were more busy with supply lines than german resistance and any resistance was outnumbered at least 10 to 1 everywhere. By the way, the production of the Tiger I had stoped in middle of 1944 and was succeded by the Tiger II, ok, I assume this Tiger made it to April 1945. Does not matter anyway. What frightens me is the behavour of Brad ""Cowboy"" Pitt, who sees a Hans Landa in every simple german soldier.  Come on Brat! It is April 1945, Berlin is totally encirceled, the Ruhr-area (main industry area of germany) completly occupied, you outnumber the germans 10:1, but you are so busy to shoot simple captured soldiers because germans are such a huge threat, still able to invest 200 soldiers to attack a single damaged Sherman tank ? I mean, how ridiculious is that ? All my respect to the american soldiers, but it was not as in this movie, that outnumbered american soldiers had to stop huge german Panzers with their bare hands and feet. Usually the americans had total air supremacy that the germans could hardly move their tanks on daylight. Every german tank was facing 10 or more Shermans. If a town did not capitulate and showed any kind of resistance, it was encirceled and bombed by planes + artillery.....waited...... still any resistance? Okay, it got bombed again. The strategy of the us-army was saving lifes through huge investing of material firepower and it worked that way. It still is the same nowadays. Americans do not fight alone in afghan caves, facing a majority of Taleban who are blindly running into american gunfire. But yeah, the killrate in ww2 was because all germans were just dumb and americans a new kind of wargods.   My grandfather was a german soldier, captured with 18 years and captured by the americans. He was imprisioned in Belgium, 100 miles behind the front line. After a week, he escaped with a comrade and passed american soldiers in his POW-clothes (no joke) when he was doing his way back home (already american occupied), waiting for war end. The GIs did not even mention him and just let him pass by. After the war, he was working for the us army as truck driver. But Brat Pitt is getting totally freaked out + heart attack when he sees that own soldiers get hurt/killed in fighting, and then he can not be stoped attacking prisoners. I mean, how could such a freak make it over 2 years through a war, if he started in north africa 42/43 ?  Okay, some of the crazy guys of you think it is justified to kill these prisoners, because they are all nazis. Yeah, and japanese civilian sliteyes deserved to be nuked, koreans and vietnamese were all non-human commies (so you are allowed to shot on everybody from your Helicopter in Nam) all russians should had been nuked if necessary (no matter if the whole planed would turn into a nuclear desert) and all arabs are terrorists. This is so anti-human and pure hatred. But when every of your enemy is a Nazi, Commie or Terrorist (so a non-human) it makes it easier to kill them unquestioned. Welcome to government-Propaganda. Well, I still hope the director wanted to make a critical movie about american soldiers in a subliminal way.
