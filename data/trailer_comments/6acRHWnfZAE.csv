We arent doen whit the Future X-men team yet! I want more movies set after X3. But i'm guessing this whole deal will create an alternate timeline and mess everything up a bit... Seeing as how X-men Apocolypse is a direct result off what happens in this movie. But alternate realities is a interesting thing to explore. I don't know... But there is atleast a Wolverin Sequel Coming after Apocolypse. So i'm guessing things will somehow be fixed. I just confused myself... HAHA!

How is McAvoy walking after the events of first class? In the X-Men 3 intro flashback Patrick Stewart as Xavier was walking as his older self. How is that possible? There were sentinels in the X-Men 3 danger room but now they finally just show up now?) These are just a small handful but big glaring potholes Bryan Singer and Fox have to deal with.

2014-03-25T07:55:29," I'll always wonder what the original X-Men trilogy could have been had Singer never abandoned X-Men for Superman Returns. Not only the trilogy but the Wolverine origins movie which wasn't much better would have both been completely different and likely significantly better if Singer been involved in any way or had the directors of X-Men: The Last Stand or X-Men Origins:Wolverine had any business directing X-men movies. The last 2 X-men films (First Class & The Wolverine) didn't have Singer involved and were both good films that were much more true to their roots but that's probably because like Singer, Matthew Vaughn & James Mangold are both proven quality directors who have probably actually read some x-men comics where as Brent Ratner and Gavin Hood had no business directing their respective X-men films and neither was known at the times they were asked to direct their movies for directing quality action films. Just because the Rush Hour movies were pretty funny doesn't make them good movies. It's just nice to see that Fox got their heads out of their asses over the last few years and has gotten the franchise back on track. It's going to be so fun to see where film technology takes both the X-Men & Avengers franchises over the next decade. I remember when they made X-Men United they could only have Colossus in his mutant form for like a minute of screen time because it was insanely expensive for his CGI, how things have changed in just 11 years. ",0,0,Devan Van Brunt,6acRHWnfZAE,0.17685185185185184,2014-03-25 07:55:29,True,True

I'm not even trying to sound like a beggar here but to those of you who are questioning on seeing this film PLEASE don't let the foolishness of some of these comments convince you all to pass on supporting what looks/happens to be one of the biggest emotional, action packed and character driven comic book movie we've had since 2012's Avengers movie. I just wish people would stop the war zone comment section of which film is better when it comes to Marvel/Disney and Fox movies. BOTH studios have had crappy films in the past and BOTH studios are working towards becoming better within the ""quality"" of their films rather than the quantity. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is getting great reviews and for Marvel finally giving us a pretty serious and thrilling action flick I applaud them on their tremendous job on handling the story and characters rather than using their well known humor (as many fans have stated) that can sometimes take away from their films. X-Men: Days of Future Past deserves this chance people! Even though DOFP is my most anticipated CBM of the summer I'm going to still support other comic book movies because this IS the year we deserve for CBMs. All I ask is that you just give this film a chance.

First is The Amazing Spiderman 2, since I've been to every Spider man movie at the theaters it kind of became my tradition to watch them on their day of release. Second is How to Train Your Dragon 2, loved the original, let's see how the sequel does.  Third is Guardians of the Galaxy, a different approach on Marvel's side. I want to see how it does, and I'm a sucker for space adventures. Fourth is Transformers 4. I am giving Michael Bay one more chance. And then that's it. And this... the only other X men movie that I am interested in besides First Class. Although I do praise Ian McKellen's acting.

2014-03-26T11:53:14,"I think it looks awesome. I'll be honest, I only read a few comics so long ago that I don't even remember what they were about. I've seen all the movies. And although the last movie had some really cheesy and flat out horrible parts in it, I thoroughly enjoyed how it showed the roots of Magneto and Xavier's conflict. The action was meh, but the focus on the contrasting beliefs between the two men was brilliant IMO. Magneto was always portrayed as this sort of tyrannic, mad man in the previous movies, but when you saw his upbringing, it was hard to blame him for wanting to defend his own kind, knowing that society would not accept them. Not to mention Fassbender version of Magneto is badass. I have a feeling this film will combine the action of the previous first 3 movies and the clash of opinions/perspectives (especially with future versions of the X-Men), being performed by a lot of really great actors. ",0,0,Onlyrealmusic4life,6acRHWnfZAE,0.10543478260869567,2014-03-26 11:53:14,True,True

I understand Fox does this so they don't shit in their pants out of worry that they'll have to give up the rights to X-Men, but they really need to take more liberties and think out of the box. There are PLENTY of other potential main protagonists that Fox could use in their X-Men movies, but they think the mainstream audience won't go to see them because, OMG WOLVERINE ISN'T IN IT!!! It's actually not that true and I've seen many of these ""mainstream"" audience members start to complain and downright hate on the X-Men film franchise since Wolverine is the main hero in ALL of them. Look, Hugh Jackman is a great actor and he was certainly born for the role but overusing him will end up in the X-Men film franchise's downfall. Plus, even if Fox grows some balls and finally  makes a X-Men movie without Wolverine, and it fails, they always have Deadpool to lean on.

Also, is this set in an apocalyptic future, with time travel afterwards? How is everyone who died in X3 alive here, and weren't most of the mutants ""cured""? How did young Xavier go to the future first? How are the present-day X-Men still their age in this seemingly future setting? When did they get time travel abilities??? Are other worlds colonized/is that a starship? When is this set, after X3 or somewhere before it? What the hell is going on?  Should I have seen ""X-Men: First Class"" or ""The Wolverine"" to know some of what I am asking? I saw neither of those last two X-Men movies, which I regret. No spoilers, please. Just try to explain the setting and time, how they got time-travel, and if it takes place after X3. Also, did The Wolverine take place after X3?

I remember reading this back in High School not able to put the comic down for a second cause it was so dark full of despair and emotion that what X-Men stood for and bringing their worse fears to life.  I don't mind the redesign of the Sentinels as much as I love the motionless roman golem look they had in the comics with far out coloring pallet it worked for comics cause it gave a still impression of fear. As a live action movie bringing the destructive intensity of the energy blast is the main point of their position in the story as those who read know what I mean about this.  Two great cast clashing in the most epic story that touched my creative imagination back then finally comes to pass in this feudal and emotional story line. Thank you Marvel and Hollywood and Bryan Singer for doing this.

2014-03-30T05:23:31,"HERE'S MY ANALYSIS OF THE TRAILER   people keep saying that the timeline don't make sense because in trailer wolverine is old but Xavier and Magneato look same as in credits to wolverine..u ever think only wolverine has aged..think about it...everyone in the trailer looks pretty much the same age as from X-MEN the Last Stand,Bobby,Kitty,Storm,Rogue,Magneato,Xavier etc etc...maybe only Wolverine has aged do to countless encounters with the sentinels..because its his healing factor that plays a vital role in him not aging..so countless battles has probably exhausted his healing abilities and he has finally began aging and it why out of everyone shown in future clips he was the only one aged..makes complete sense if u had to think about it...he is the badass un-killable mutant that loves whooping evil asses...sentinels would be on his ass non stop so he would have gotten fucked up 6-8 times a day..that would have weakened his healing ability so he might start aging rapidly with every battle.,...that's my theory..i mean he is supposed to be the main protagonist of the newest film right?makes sense they try and show the war has effected him and his amazing abilities..and that even the future has made him weak and that it must be changed.  and as for Xavier talking to himself..he obviously implanted messages in Logan's mind for himself..that face to face is more theatrics...obviously he was looking into Logan's mind and seeing his older self talking to Logan when he was implanting the message  and as for erasing the future with this whole story..like UN-doing all movies 1 through 3...in the comics version of days of future past all there plan to undo the future did was create a alternate timeline the older timeline went unchanged...so who knows what direction they will go in  some people who watch comic movies have never truly read comic books, so them picking out stupid stuff in trailers is laughable because they know not very much about the heroes they cheer...but those who have read comics don't post ur complaints on the trailers,..ur smarter than that to know anything u see in a trailer makes u wanna speculate and get u thinking because the comic fans out there have wanted to see this movies happen for years..ur smarter so at least wait for the movies release to complain, at least then u can confirm if what ur bitching about is real or just speculation based on small snippets of a 2 minute trailer",3,2,Enigma Studios,6acRHWnfZAE,-0.04010052447552447,2014-03-30 05:23:31,True,True

With three and this one I know that it is supposed to be Storm but I always feel like I am always aware that I am watching Halle Berry play a role in a movie.

2014-04-13T23:08:41,"For those of you who keep saying ""X-Men 3 is no longer canon"" or that it's being ""written out of existence"", why do you keep saying that? If you actually SAW X-Men 3, you'd see that Magneto didn't lose ALL of his powers and that Xavier managed to find another body, hence why they are both appearing in this movie.  Now as for Magneto getting back to full strength and Xavier finding a clone body, well that needs more explaining.  And if you saw The Wolverine, which takes place AFTER X-Men 3, it not only acknowledges X3 through several references and a subtplot with Logan feeling bad about killing Jean by stabbing her, but it also clearly ties it in to Days of Future Past.  In the post credits of The Wolverine, Logan was clearly shocked to see Xavier alive (though admittedly not that shocked that Magneto had powers), so again, X-Men 3 is canon, ALL the movies are canon and there's no movie being left out. That said, that doesn't make things that much better since X-Men: First Class ruined the timeline by not only contradicting X-Men 3, but ALL of the previous X-Men movies.  I don't know how Days of Future Past is gonna fix that, but it had better, otherwise this whole film series makes no sense anymore.",1,0,Charles Magnus,6acRHWnfZAE,-0.03768115942028984,2014-04-13 23:08:41,True,True

2014-04-29T21:40:04,"In my Overrall opinion on the change of kitty pryde to wolverine was completely sexist and embarrassing. Why I say embarrassing is beacsue there excuse so totally immature! Saying Oh ""Wolverine is the most beloved character"" is basically in my opinion another way of suger-coding saying that it should be a male role model with More experience. Why make a movie about the xmen original story if basically the whole entire movie is going to be changed? as a kitty pryde fan I was completely furious when I heard about this sudden change, and then it caused me to hate the wolverine character more then I had already did so. I agree with other peoples opinions saying that they over use wolverine as the main character in every movie. in My honest opinion I don't know why people like wolverine that much anyway! hes basically a male version of a badass cat. When I say they focus on him to much is like for example...- the story between phoenix ""jean grey' and scott summers was one of the most important more cared about scenario in the xmen franchise and yet there hasn't been a movie about them, instead they put out a movie such as wolverine origens which really wasn't all that important and cared for. Back on the main topic, they could've made some adjustments that could still allow ellen page or kitty pryde to still be the leading character such as drag the time line earlier or something so she could actually be alive (if they could make a drastic move like replacing her completely the they could've done something like this) but instead on actually giving her a chance in the movie they completely replaced her. And anyone saying that main characters have to be well known are lying. If you look at first class Mystique, Banshee, pixie, havoc etc. weren't really known characters but they got to play a major role in the film portrayed as main characters. I just think this decision was utterly immature and stupid.",0,3,PyoJi's Boyfriend,6acRHWnfZAE,0.12974806201550393,2014-04-29 21:40:04,True,True
