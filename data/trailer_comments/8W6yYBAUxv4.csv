And then later, it shows 5 different hands on a box that they fished out of the water, not 6.  When I first watched this trailer, he was already my favorite of the 6. Dang.  Edit: Because I'm that one nerd that over analyses everything, I found a moment where one of the guys was saying ""they're watching us"" with 4 people looking at a camera.

This movie was honestly one of the worst movies I have seen in the longest time. I am not over exaggerating, this had to be honestly one of the top 10 worst movies I had ever seen!     I spent $15 to see a movie whereby the protagonist was apathetic in her acting, the conclusion was underwhelming and almost nonsequential.     In the scene where Ben and Jason were fighting, it seemed like a 2 minute rave where the lights went in and out suddenly. This left me nearly vomiting because of the exposure to my eyes, and honestly felt sick after the movie.     Furthermore, the actor who played Denny miscued  in his lines, leaving one feeling irritated by his performance. He seemed to be an annoyance to me personally in his acting.     Moreover, it felt like in it's promotion preluding the film's release, the production team deceived the audience into making it seem the film to be a thriller whereby one would feel gripped.     It has now been 2 weeks since viewing the movie, and still am disgusted by the horrendous nature of this film. This is the first movie review I have ever written (so I hope that says something). I am saddened foremost by how Hollywood chiefly propagates enmity towards the things of God. But for me, if speaking of production value this film deserve a Razzie Award.

2020-05-07T09:48:15,"I had to write a review of the movie for my class. Here you go. i hope it helped ya.   A handful of people. Strangers to each other. Each receive a strange box, containing a note inviting them to join a new and exciting escape room. The room is located in a boring and abandoned office building in Chicago. The winner of this escape attempt would receive a reward of no less than 10,000 dollars. Those players have an ear for that! Participants included shy college student Zoe, grocery store worker Ben, veteran Amanda, obese Mike, nerdy gamer Danny, and arrogant stockbroker Jason. Completely different characters, whose weaknesses will be exploited considerably, but will the strengths of each of them dominate? Well, you have to watch the movie to find out what happens.    Although the subject is very familiar, director Adam Robitel manages to provide the viewer with an amusing, entertaining and at times, really exciting horror print. It never becomes really high-quality cinema with a lot of content, but the film definitely does what it should do. Halfway through the story it also gets a bit more in-depth, which makes it all a bit more interesting in the end.    The atmosphere is very well-made in the film, you are, as it were, sucked into the film. You do feel sorry for the characters though, it‚Äôs kind of rough what they‚Äôre going through. The gamemaster literally knows everything about them, from their medical files to every detail of the trauma they have. The characters get challenged between life and death situations. They get pushed to think about their trauma situations and they know that there‚Äôs only one winner in this game. The characters first get locked in a room that‚Äôs like a giant oven, then they get trapped in the cold, then in an upside down room where the floor is falling down, literally. And 3 more rooms that get some of them killed. They know it‚Äôs not just a game anymore. I really didn‚Äôt expect that this movie was going to be this astonishing, but the way the atmosphere is made, is just unbelievable.    The movie Escape Room is not a bad horror thriller that makes you stare at the screen from the first second to the very last image. Adam Robitel, director of, among others, Insidious: The Last Key (2018) - undoubtedly delivers an amusing horror print that really entertains the viewer. The story may be kinda thin and the characters too transparent, but everything still seems to work. Only the acting gets into trouble several times, but that does not completely spoil the final product. To cut a long story short: Escape Room is a great horror print to watch once, no more, no less. The film is distributed by Sony Pictures and has been available on DVD and Blu-Ray since July 3, 2019.",1,0,Dilaraa Goodlifee,8W6yYBAUxv4,0.05680976430976432,2020-05-07 09:48:15,False,False
