2017-04-12T13:27:36,"As promising as this looks, I'm still gonna keep my hype a little low. We have a lot happening in this movie, and that offers a chance to clutter the film and make it messy. We have ye olde knights, Izzy's story, Cade's story, the Barricade fight, some stuff in space and on Cybertron, a bit of Megatron and his solo story, a history lesson with Hopkins, a cast of robots in London at some point, a giant ass dragon, some dinobots. And after all those plot points and characters we have it somehow come together with Prime fighting Bee, Prime fighting some Knights, and Prime fighting Megatron while Cybertron attempts to rebuild itself by attaching  chunks of the earth to it for some specific reason. That's a lot to bundle up in a simple enough story that doesn't get overly complicated and hard to follow or too boring to the point where the only saving grace is the clearly well put together visuals.  I can say without a shred of a doubt that this movie will be fun to watch. But watching is only part of the experiance, you also need to listen to what is happening and understand it so that you can walk away having enjoyed the story to a degree. If I have to settle for just enjoying the visuals, then that'd be a letdown. I want this movie to be competent enough that I can say ""Yeah, The Last Knight has a half decent story. It's nothing ground breaking, but it makes sense and makes for a good movie"", rather than looking back like with AOE and thinking ""Well it was too long for it's own good and the bland story made it drag""  Unlike some people who generally don't like these movies for their own reasons, I sincerely hope this movie does well enough. I dont expect it to get high reviews, because it's a sequel to such a poorly written movie and has to rely on that movie and it's characters. But for the folks who worked on the movie's sake, especially Michael Bay (if he finally hangs up the cybertronian hat after this one), I hope they finally have a good movie on their hands.",1,0,JMotion,6Vtf0MszgP8,0.08083333333333334,2017-04-12 13:27:36,True,True

For those that say the plots of the movies suck, it's not like we said back then that the show/comics suck because of the story. What we remember is vehicles transforming into robots, and this is what these movies bring. You can't tell me that the first time you saw Optimus transform in the first movie, you didn't jizz in your pants. And the action scenes are just so crazy! I believe these movies are PG-13, but if these deaths were in a movie done to humans, it would clearly be rated R. We have faces torn in half and flesh stripped off, with gunshots straight to the friggin face! So no one can't say that these movies aren't done justice.

2017-04-12T15:34:45,"OK, I had too watch this trailer a couple of times, just so I can talk about this trailer naturally. This trailer looks good, but it isn't amazing, in fact the way they have this made, they spoiled basically everything in the film, granted this film isn't the first contender of doing this, but it's easy to tell what is going to happen in what order. Granted the scenes they chose are good choices, as evidenced by the reaction of people in the comments at things like Optimus ripping off Bee's ""wings"" or the destruction of the 5-6 cybertronians -I refuse to call them Cybertronian Knights or the Infernicons at this stage- but the rest of the footage, just seems OK. The scene with Quintessa -the ""Maker""- was alright, nothing too special. From this trailer I get a bit of a ""Dark of the Moon"" vibe, mainly with Earth being threatened to be turned into Cybertron. This film looks like it has the same problem as the last films, where it focuses more on humans being a mcguffin for giant robots, as well as having the problem of who is who due to the dull colours, except for Optimus and Bumblebee because they are the -ones who sell toys- most recognizable faces in Transformers. Look, I see this film being an average film, it won't be anything too spectacular, call me a hater all you want, I won't care, I'm not a hardcore fan who hates everything about anything not G1, not am I an average moviegoer, I am just a casual TF fan showing my opinion on a trailer. Now, that I got that out of the way, I would like to say that Bumblebee isn't going to die in this film, so don't worry, he is the kid appeal character, he is the one who sells toys, he is the leader of the Autobots -since Optimus is evil- and he has his own spin off movie coming next year, so yea he isn't going to die.",0,0,Nebby,6Vtf0MszgP8,0.16886446886446876,2017-04-12 15:34:45,True,True

2017-04-12T21:24:43,"There are two observations in regards to my theory about the plot that I would like to share: 1). How is it that such of an evolved species displays this level of obsession with power and are still going through civil war stages? 2). Then the thought of how obsessed mankind has and still is with immortality, or simply the need to adapt to a hostile reaction of nature ... see where I'm going... so Here is my theory: 1). Transformer = Human's next evolution step.  Where in a near future, we will figure how to transfer our consciousness to virtually immortal vessels 2). They are us coming from the future, and not aliens from another galaxy.  Then... 3). Earth = Cybertron (or at least I believe Earth is destined to wear it just like an Exo-suit ;)) ...I can't really think of any major flaws when applying my theory to the prequels; besides the fact they haven't mentioned the details of their true origins yet (for obvious reasons)  So here are a couple of things I would like to see by the end: 1). The Witwicky's bloodline evolving into the Prime's legacy (that would be epic) and that is why the remarkable connection Sam had with Prime in the Fallens' storyline mainly 2). What life lesson is the movie (story) going to leave us?

Transformers is a thrill ride for those who grew up with it and a taste of memories for younger audiences. This franchise does get a lot of hate but who can hate Peter Cullen‚Äôs Optimus? He‚Äôs a role model for not only myself, but many people around the world. The new movie, The Last Knight does look pretty awesome with the look of Cybertron and Optimus having a bigger role to play.

2017-04-13T22:10:04,"Actually, I am a little bit disappointed with this movie. Well, if we look back at the 2007 movie, the movie is more at present, not the future like this is. What I mean is, the movies have gone from old and good  present, to a new and hard future. The only Autobots who is left from 2007-2011 is Optimus and Bumblebee. They others is dead or have leave earth and we probably ever won't see them again. I miss when it was more at 'present' like in 2007, 2009 and 2011. Present. But in the 2014, and now 2017, I feel that they have made the future here little crazy and fast. Nothing old is left. Just new future, new future. They couldn't have made so that some more autobots would have survived? Too late for Jazz, Ironhide, Que, Ratchet and Leadfoot, but maybe Dino? Sideswipe? And Jolt? What happened to him exactly? Was he even in the Dark of the Moon? The twins and the three arcee sisters are also dead. I feeling that if maybe Ratchet wouldn't have to die i Age of Extinction, that he survived, I would probably have been not so disappointed. They killing lovley and old Autobots from the 2007-2011 movies, some survived, but we don't get to see what actually really happened to them? And why would even Hound, Crosshairs and Drift come to Earth only to be hunting down or hide? I really wished that they could have change some things in the movies. Just let one more survive or try to hold on to the present and safe but slowly going over to the past, and not just rush over to it. If something of this would have been changed to, I would be more okay with it than disappointed.  This is what I think and it is my thoughts, so if you think something else or have other thoughts, I will respect it, and I hope you will respect mine. :^)",0,0,Kladdis Mlx,6Vtf0MszgP8,0.019987373737373734,2017-04-13 22:10:04,True,True

Moreover, I can feel a lot of love coming out of this trailer, in all its shades. Just think of the past movies and then watch this again taking into account my words.

2017-05-05T01:57:17,"Everyone needs to realize that what's happening to Optimus Prime here was what he was on his way to becoming anyway so I don't think it's a big deal! I mean, from the beginning, the largest theme IMHO of this series is the utilitarian vs. Kantian ideology (with the latter being held by Prime in all of his incarnations as well as in the first movie). Galloway was supposed to embody the former and it was supposed to be a great clash of ideals between him and Prime until TF2 totally dropped the ball with it! Then Optimus (and even the Bayformers fans) starts to turn hypocritical thanks to the third and fourth movie (the latter most of all), as he leans closer and closer to the other spectrum, especially when Cemetery Wind and KSI (arguably taking up the Kantian role) try to put an end to the whole war, all the suffering, and all the loss when they tried to destroy both factions themselves--they did have the motivation after all since most of their loved ones were lost in the Battle of Chicago, making them not so unsympathetic IMO. It'll be nice to see that continue in this film with the TRF taking up CW's role and the fact that one of the main characters, Izabella, was orphaned from the Battle of Chicago (which spawned CW and in turn the TRF). However, whereas Optimus would've usually found a way to resolve the tensions and conflict between his team and these desperate human groups in Age of Extinction, he has now instead fully tipped over to the other side of that ideology, none more evident when he says ""For my world to live, yours must die."" So all in all, even though he may have ended up controlled by these Creators, he was still on his way to this mindset anyway.",1,0,William Kerfoot,6Vtf0MszgP8,0.1300189393939394,2017-05-05 01:57:17,True,True

Plus, I can't have been the only one to notice that in Age of Extinction, Lockdown took Ratchet's spark instead of destroying it. I have so many theories though about this whole movie. Like in G1, they went to war with the Quintessons because the Quints. said that they created the transformers. Optimus's maker sure looked like a more up to date version of G1s Quintessons.

2017-06-25T23:36:09,"I haven't seen this one yet, but the previous films have all been CG Garbage.  As an engineer, I appreciated Pacific Rim's realistic CG/METAL effects that showed at least some attempt to create realistic mechanical engineering (except for the helicopters carrying Jaegers like lego toys, that was stupid).    However, the Transformers movies are literally a 3D cartoon with its metal components that fold out of nothing, unrealistic joints, unrealistic mass/density, and non-proportional weight/mass around real world objects.  No, a 50 foot tall machine cannot fold down into the size of a Camaro without having some spacial/density trickery (Like the Tardis's ""tiny"" phone booth outside, ""massive"" space inside type science).  Try applying some real mechanical engineering to these machines first (Model them in real engineering software like Pro Engineer Wildflower), instead of drawing cartoons and then animating straight to 3D.  Toss out the unnecessary sexual innuendos that make it impossible for me to take my kid, create an interesting backstory that could stand on its own without the transformers propping up terrible writing, and then perhaps you might actually make a Transformer movie that is profitable.",0,0,EE Shane,6Vtf0MszgP8,-0.05439814814814816,2017-06-25 23:36:09,False,True

2017-06-28T20:00:23,YES FINALLY! Michael Bay has finally stopped making these films and hopefully the new director will redeem this fallen franchise. Ever since the first one 10 years ago this film series has disgraced the Transformers series. It's turned the badass Witwicky from G1 into a spineless coward. They made Galvatron in a way that was so awful that they had to turn him back into Megatron. And to top it all off they've killed off more characters in the films then they did in G1. Allow me to make a list. (Autobots) Ironhide Ratchet Arcee Elita-One Sideswipe Jazz Mirage Chromia Wheeljack Jolt Leadfoot Warpath (Decepticons) Starscream Soundwave Shockwave Devastator Ravage Laserbeak  And there's my point.

2017-06-30T06:00:45,"**SPOILERS**  Honestly I'm a fan of Michael Bay's Transformers movies, like seriously you wouldn't find a bigger fan of Michael Bay's Transformers movies than me, but honestly I can only say that for the first 3 movies. I cannot defend Age of Extinction or The Last Knight.  Transformers:  Was great but it was the first one so they held back a little because they weren't sure how far they could go yet.  Transformers ROTF: to me was good it just did a little too much and ended up dragging on a little too long and it was basically just too big of a sequel to follow the first movie but was still wasn't horrible to me.  Transformers DOTM: was great it just kinda contradicted it's main character from the first movie (Sam goes from wanting to go to college to be normal in ROTF to wanting to matter and do more in DOTM and it was just like well make up your mind) and overall the movie starts kinda slow and kinda oddly but once it starts moving it it really gets moving and that can be either good or bad depending on how you like pacing.  Transformers AOE: I literally don't even remember90% of this movie. It WAS SO DAMN BORING like I just didn't care about anything. The characters were boring (both robot and human) cause they completely gutted the cast that made the first 3 work and I just didn't feel connected or emotionally invested into any of thembut Optimus or Bumblebee and as I sit here writing this comment I swear I can't even rememeber the name of a single charcater other than Optimus, Bumblebee, Megtron, and Hound cause everyone else was just forgettable.  Transformers TLK: just.......wtf, like I don't know what this was supposed to be. It was literally insulting, when Optimus is about to kill Bumblebee he stops when Bumblebee speaks and that somehow snaps Prime out of his nemesis state. Like why? He even said ""I haven't heard your voice since the fall of Cybertron"". That's not even true, you heard it at the end of movie 1 and then the following 3 movies his voice suddenly no longer works again until it's conviently need to save him vs Prime? And it wasn;t even the same voice at the end of movie 1. Come on Michael Bay, who's writing this stuff?",1,0,ThePlasticBowl,6Vtf0MszgP8,0.01973343685300208,2017-06-30 06:00:45,False,True

Izabella, the black dude that i never seen in fourth one , Vivan or whatever her name is is annoying and pointless   this movie is made to distory Optimus Prime's character  there no character development at all expect Bumblebee, Hound , Dirft and that green autobot . The only good thing about the movie was Bumblebee and Megatron thats it  This movie is focus way to much Humans and i found Anthony Hopkins's  Character a little annoying.  Michael Bay clearly have no idea what to do with this franchise . He distoryed my favorite character (Optimus Prime)'s Reputation. But it was good to see Josh Duhmmel back  There were good action scenes that i like in the flim  . This flim gets a 2/10 . Spider-Man Homecoming was better than this movie  but these two movies  (this movie and Spider-Man Homecoming) was the worst movies of 2017. But Transformers the last night is extremely the worst. If I watch this movie again i will watch it for bumblebee.  The one last Postive thing i say about The Last Night  is its better than Age of Extinction  Thats it  But i can't wait to see Bumblebee's Movie tho",1,0,CJ Showdown,6Vtf0MszgP8,-0.07323717948717948,2017-09-28 20:23:41,False,False

Also In the movie the old man was talking to the chick and he basically pulled out her family tree. If I‚Äôm not mistaken it said witwickie on the front. He also said that this chick is the last living descendent of Merlin. So does that mean that Sam is dead? Also is anyone else tired of seeing megatron being reincarnated over and over again? In the last movie he was reincarnated as galvetron but in this one he looks/sounds nothing like galvetron. Whatever happened to that? Also we never saw him die in this movie, we only saw him get kicked out of the side of a planet. We never got a definitive death, which doesn‚Äôt mean shit considering he has died before and was sunk to the bottom of the sea.

2017-11-03T10:42:00,"[SPOILERS!!] ALSO QUITE LONG AS I RAMBLED A BIT I have to say I was very disappointed with this movie. It suddenly brings up so many new characters and ideas, that just bring up so many more questions. Some of the characters popped in with no context and then were all of a sudden crucial to the plot, and almost all of them were very bland. Megatron, who was the main villain for the previous movies, and actually seemed like a proper threat, wasn't nearly as vicious or ruthless as before, and didn't contribute that much to the plot. If he was taken out of it, not much would have changed. The actual villain barely had any screen time, and the battle with her lasted a couple minutes at most. Pretty underwhelming. There is one section where Optimus is about to fight several opponents at once, and instead of having an epic, tense fight like the forest battle in TF2, he kills them all in one second, with one blow. Again, pretty underwhelming. The plot is thrown into your face without any context, and is pretty easy to miss. Yes, Quintessa (who has not been mentioned in the previous movies,) wants to destroy Earth, or Unicron (again, not mentioned previously) which is completely different to the other variations of him in previous movies, comics and shows. But why? It is apparently an 'enemy' to Cybertron, but so far in the movies canon, it has done nothing to do so. Also, the 'Knight' Transformers were here fighting in the medieval times? They were rebelling against Quintessa, but I thought the only reason the Transformers came here in the first place was because of the Allspark. Another annoying thing is the robots. In the first few movies, the transformations made sense. You could see all the parts moving around in a way that worked. Now it's parts shifting through each other and it doesn't look as cool, and doesn't make any sense. They also LOOKED like actual robots, but now, especially Optimus, they look like big people in metal suits. The only thing this movie does well are its visuals, which are astounding. Although the CGI is sometimes a bit off in some sections, the Transformers series has some of the best CGI that I have seen, even though it seems to have downgraded slightly as the movies go on (especially TF4, with it's crappy 'Transformium' bullshit that made no sense). This movie was just a plothole filled mess, which just left me confused even more than it should have. I actually got a bit bored watching it. Often I watch a movie and then do my homework, but I kept checking how much runtime was left so that I could get on with doing it. This was the last TF movie that Michael Bay has done, and it seemed like a rush to get it out of the way so that he could do something else. The franchise will continue though, and hopefully our unknown director can pull off something good.",0,0,Toby Thurlow White,6Vtf0MszgP8,0.019742883379247005,2017-11-03 10:42:00,False,False

2018-05-14T18:45:39,"I really hope they don't restart this franchise. I think the pieces are in place for this to continue. This franchise actually predates the Avengers, so I would hate to see it end. There are some things I would change though...  1) Move on from Michael Bay. I think he turned what many thought would be sort of short one-movie deal into a franchise despite the many shortcomings. I don't think many people expected the original Transformers movie to become what it was. However, I think most of us are tired of the same action and same jokes and same script features that cater to ""teenage boys"" as he once put it. Imagine if somebody like the Russo Brothers directed a Transformers movie. It could have a deeper plot driven story based on the existing universe. There are many directors out there who could be capable of directing one of these movies.  2) Focus more on the Transformers and less on humans. I get the fact that the ongoing war of Autobots and Decepticons is happening on Earth, but I wish they would play it out more with the Transformers battling and the humans trying to deal with it. Not have Mark Wahlberg actually have a sword fight with a robot that could obviously kill him by stepping on him.   3) The music by Steve Jablonsky has been the highlight of most of the movies for me. Such an original score that has been carried out through the franchise is a rarity and something Marvel has somewhat not been as consistent with. Of course Marvel has more franchises within their universe, but even within those, there have been inconsistencies. Jablonsky has brought consistency that I like that really adds an epicness to the franchise that began in the first movie.   4) If they want to build a Marvel-style universe, Hasbro/Paramount need to sit down and plan it out properly and make the movies different, but work towards a final end of some sort. I think they have been doing that, but not to the level that Marvel Studios has done. Most of the Transformers movies seem to just end with no plan for the next one except for The Last Knight explaining that Unicron is Earth. Perhaps this was planned all along, but it wasn't really teased in the movies until now.   5) I personally would like to see Shia LeBeouf return as Sam Witwicky despite the hints that he is dead in The Last Knight. If he did come back, I would like to see him more as a battle-tested soldier who is implanted with NEST or some other special forces team working with the Autobots as seen in Revenge of the Fallen. With this said, there are other Witwicky's in the Transformers comic universe that could become that role. Although, The Last Knight teased that all Witwicky's may now be dead.   6) I think the CGI has been pretty spectacular over the course of the films, although I think it has been declining to an extent because they are adding so much more to each movie. If the movies are going to be set on Earth, then cut back on some of it. If they movie are going off the planet, then more would be necessary.   7) This idea is probably the wildest and least likely to happen. Bring Transformers into the Marvel Cinematic Universe if it is rebooted. This happened in the comics in the 80's and 90's and might work in the movies under the right circumstances. Of course, Marvel doesn't need this to happen and probably doesn't want it. I think most fans probably don't want to see this either. Even if they did, the rights issues would likely hamstring this actually happening. But this could be an interesting idea in the distant future as the Marvel stories play out after the potential return of some of the core characters to Marvel Studios. I wouldn't dismiss any deals with Kevin Feige at the helm of Marvel. Disney also probably wouldn't mind getting their hands on Transformers either. The idea of exploring the origins of Unicron and Primus or Cybertron being teased in a distant Captain Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy, or Nova movie within the MCU is a interesting prospect.",1,0,MR Jack,6Vtf0MszgP8,0.1307338394294916,2018-05-14 18:45:39,False,False

2020-04-29T06:32:25,"As a long time transformers fan this has got to be the WORST transformers movie I have ever seen. I remembered being so hyped about this back in late 2016, when the first trailer dropped. Then when I watched it in theaters I was left disappointed. There are so many things wrong with this movie even someone like me, who loves transformers, can hate it. I know the movies aren‚Äôt that good but I still find enjoyment in them, but this movie I can barely find any. There is gonna be a lot of reading so stick around if ya want.  The story itself is pretty dull and confusing as shit. It feels like a really bad fanfiction and feels very rushed. First of all, why does transformers keep using artifacts as a major importance in the story? First the Allspark, then the Matrix, the pillars, the seed, and now the staff of merlin. These plot devices are so common now it has practically become a cliche in transformers movies, thank god Bumblebee fixed that. While I do like the idea that transformers have been with humanity for thousands of years, it messes with the continuity from the previous movies, which I will get to soon. Cade and Vivian‚Äôs relationship feels rushed and forced. I mean I can‚Äôt really see these two as a couple but more as partners in crime. It could have worked but the story had so much going on that made it feel forced. Some things in the movie aren‚Äôt really explained well, like 85% of the story happens off screen. It‚Äôs that confusing. I did some research and discovered there was 40 minutes of footage cut from the movie. If they kept it they probably would have helped the story make sense.  The story is also a gigantic mess. There are SO many plot holes in this movie. How does Bumblebee repair himself? Where did the baby dinobots come from? How did Galvatron become Megatron again? How is Barricade alive? So many fucking plot holes. The biggest ones have got to be where Bumblebee speaks and Optimus says he hasn‚Äôt heard it since cybertron fell but ten years earlier he speaks his real voice. You could argue that the one in 2007 was just the radio, but both Sam and Prime treated it like it was his real voice and almost all of his radio dialogue was a combination of words from different sources, that one wasn‚Äôt. So did Optimus forget? Or was it just shitty writing? Second is the whole transformers being on earth for many years. There was an artwork of ships with a transformer that clearly is Ironhide, however in 2007 he crashed on earth for the first time. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. Even in Bumblebee, which is canon to the movies, he crashes to earth in 87 but in TLK he was fighting Nazis in WWII. Did they return to cybertron? It was never explained at all. At this point I can‚Äôt even see Transformers 07 and TLK being canon because of the shitty writing.  The Decepticons are a joke, especially Megatron. Let's start out with Megatron, hands down the worst version from the previous movies. I don‚Äôt care how cool he looks, Megatron was a joke. Since ROTF he‚Äôs been somebody‚Äôs dog, from the Fallen, to Sentinel, to the humans rebuilding and temporarily controlling him, and now to Quintessa. In 2007 he was a monster, no one could overpower him, the guy was fucking terrifying, even in the little things like Ratchet telling everyone to retreat after his appearance, to Megatron beating the shit out of Prime. That‚Äôs how Megatron should be, sadly since transformers 2 that is no longer the case. In this however, Megatron is really terrible. He has to negotiate with humans to get his team? He should have destroyed the prison and freed them himself. MEGATRON DOES NOT HAVE TO LISTEN TO HUMAN DEMANDS. Also let us not forget he teamed up with the TRF, that is something he would never do. He doesn‚Äôt feel threatening either, he just feels like a thing for everyone to fight. Next the decepticons are really forgettable. Mohawk, Nitro zeus, Dreadbot, these all were just punching bags for the good guys and Hasbro probably wanted more characters to make more toys to make money. I also refuse to call that one decepticon, Onslaught. If you took them out of the story there wouldn‚Äôt be much of a difference. I also hated that Suicide Squad part.  The autobots are still the basic good guys and stuff. I really only like Bumblebee and Hound, mostly because Bumblebee is awesome and I love John Goodman voicing Hound. No real interesting traits, just there to shoot bad guys. But Optimus/Nemesis is the problem. I strongly like the Optimus that believed in freedom and basically acted as the Obi Wan of the transformers universe. But here he‚Äôs just a hulking brute who likes to tear people‚Äôs faces off. Like Megatron, Since ROTF, he‚Äôs changed a lot. He‚Äôs become more violent and brutal and willing to kill humans to save his planet. That is not Prime. His transition to Nemesis could‚Äôve been better if maybe he was under control but still resisted killing humans or Bumblebee, like in G1 when Optimus tried to kill Rodimus under the control of the Quintessons, but he still tried to resist it. Here he‚Äôs just flat out ok with it. Optimus is a symbol of hope and freedom that remains very stoic and someone the autobots look up to. He was like this in the first movie but then he changed in the sequel. You could say he‚Äôs gone mad because of losing his comrades. But he has gone through many challenges in other universes and still remained a calm noble leader. Also in the trailers he was teased as the big baddie, but he was only in the movie for like ten minutes which pissed me off. There‚Äôs something I hate about when trailers tease a major villain and he‚Äôs barely in there. It‚Äôs like if marvel teased Thanos to be a big bad guy in infinity war, but only be in there for like 5 minutes. It would be like ‚ÄúHey assholes! Imma snap you all away ROFLMAO.‚Äù But yeah, Nemesis, worst villain of the franchise. I think the humans in AOE were better villains than Nemesis.   The humans? Lol they are all fucking terrible. In this movie they are just a bunch of uninteresting cardboard cutouts. I don‚Äôt need to talk about them. I do like Simmons however. Also the TRF are just an excuse for Bay to show off some fight scenes and explosions. They released so many trailers for this movie, I think it‚Äôs almost an hour worth of trailers and teasers. Let's be honest, the trailers were much better than the movie. There are some good things about the movie. Like the Bumblebee and Prime fight, the idea of transformers being on earth for eons, Cogman is actually enjoyable sometimes, and Unicron being present. The only reason why I want a sequel is to see Unicron in all his glory other than that this franchise needs better writers and a better director. If not just let Travis Knight direct the sequels or let the franchise die.   TL;DR: Plot is dumb and confusing, Megatron sucks, Optimus is shit, Humans are forgettable, this movie sucks, I need a goddamn mountain dew.  Some of you will agree with me, some won‚Äôt, and many will hate me. I respect that other people can like this movie but I could not enjoy it even as a transformers fan. Thanks for reading.
