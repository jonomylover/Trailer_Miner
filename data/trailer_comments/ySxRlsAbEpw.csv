2017-09-25T18:17:30,"Just watched, 'American Assassin' and this has to be one of the most manipulative movies I have ever seen. This is total, 'Military Industrial Complex' propaganda. It starts with a terror attack on a beach to spark recent programmed emotional states of empathy with the main character, which suckers you into the trap of hatred towards the movies protagonists (in reality it is the worlds governments that cause the terror) which are the Iranian's. The main idea of the story is Iran wants to bomb Israel with a nuke and the CIA has to stop them using a classified black ops cell. It turns out that the whole thing is a sham and the actual enemy is a rouge American CIA agent that wants to use a nuke to bomb an American fleet (Because the biggest threat to America is the american themselves). The film ends the a threat of attack on America from Iran, very telling stuff! The casting for the male lead was interesting too a young 20 something skinny guy, not some muscle bound Jar head, this was to make the character relatabel to the vast majority of men. This is to subtly influence men, which is a direct attack the divine masculine itself. If you inner-stand the nature of reality being a placebo mind construct (i.e what we believe we create) you will know without doubt how dangerous this movie is for the sleeping masses. This is sheer mind-manipulation and actually quite fucking sloppy at that. The, 'Military Industrial Complex' has wanted war between Iran and Israel for decades and it is there feeble attempt to shift to alternate timelines, it seems to me like an act of desperation.......

It reminded of how Darth Vader was such a bad ass for so many years until the pre-quals showed him as a whiny out of control brat. Ruined the whole thing. The worst part was the ""trade craft"" though. This a movie about covert warriors - apex predators and they got around like terrible agent stereotypes. Touching their ears to talk so you new they were on comms (Duh), sitting across the road or table staring at targets, walking through crowds like they were sharks about to smash a baby seal vs blending in, looking away while talking to each other when they were the only people in the scene and area. Fucking terrible. No way in hell any professional organization would let that douche pass any entry standards testing. He'd be fucked off day one. It makes out the senior guy with decades of experience knows nothing and the disobedient loser new guy is right by doing the wrong thing all the time. Shit.
