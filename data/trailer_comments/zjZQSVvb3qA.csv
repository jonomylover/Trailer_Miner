2014-12-10T18:01:17,"Film This where i leave you subtitrat 2014-Aici ne despartim este un film de drama-comedie american bazat pe romanul cu acelas nume al romanicerului Jonathan Tropper , care a scris de asemenea si scenariul filmului si regizat de e Shawn Levy .Este un film emotionant , care examineaza cu umor motivele din spatele actiunilor noastre cele mai afectuoase, dar si a celor mai rautacioase si care exploreaza relatiile noastre, complicate si contradictorii, cu aceia pe care ii numim familia noastra. Film This where i leave you-Aici ne despartim se dovedeste a fi ceva mai mult decat o comedie de familie-o familie de evrei-, ci si o deconstructie nepretentioasă si amuzantă a catorva mituri pe care le cultivăm in societate. De pildă: traim adesea cu iluzia că intr-o situatie de criză iti gasesti refugiul si sprijinul, unde altundeva decat… in sanul familie (mai ales cand aceasta e suficient de numeroasa- patru copii). Suntem increzători de asemenea că adultii au maturitatea de a- si rezolva constructiv si fară ranchiună conflictele. Judd Altman(Jason Bateman ), eroul principal dar si naratorul intamplarilor, e un barbat trecut de 30 de ani, aflat intr-o criza existentiala fiind inselat de sotia sa cu seful sau… Iar pentru Judd viata nu pare să devina mai usoara, după ce tocmai s-a despartit de nevasta sa el mai traieste o alta drama –moartea tataului sau. Timp de sapte zile alaturi de toti membrii familiei trebuie sa cinsteasca meomoria tatului sau dupa datinile evreiesti. . In casa parinteasca, acolo unde instalatiile electrice si peretii subtiri pregătesc surprize (ne)placute, familia Altman are de indurat mai degrabă un travaliu al suportabilitatii, decat o solidaritate a reintalnirii intr-un moment atat de trist. Fiecare membru poartă in spate o serie de probleme si de conflicte surde gata in orice moment să expodeze…..  Distributia Film This is where i leave you subtitrat 2014-Aici ne despartim:  Corey Stoll ca Pavel Altman, cea mai mare dintre cele patru frati; fratele responsabil pentru afacerea familiei. El este căsătorit cu Annie.  Jason Bateman ca Judd Altman, baiatul mijlociu si naratorul filmului celor patru frati Altman. Tina Fey ca Wendy Altman, una dintre surori ; o mamă responsabilă, care este căsătorit cu Barry și are 2 copii.Ea este fosta iubita prietenului ei din copilarie Horry. Adam Driver ca Phillip Altman, cel mai mic dintre cele patru frati; playboy de familie.
