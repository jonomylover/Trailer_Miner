I'm fine with people having religious beliefs, that's their choice, but God's Not Dead was poorly made. Awful acting, the teacher gave an okay performance though, but the writing was so bad it hurt. I get that you want to make your movie have a message, but it's so misinformed and preachy that I found it unwatchable. The concept alone is ridiculous; it's clear that the people on campus know how the teacher is, yet he's still working. In reality, he'd be fired in a heartbeat. But to me, the biggest insult is how they portray anyone who isn't Christian. Every Atheist in the movie is played as a despicable human being with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The line stating that every Atheist was once religious is also false. Think of Atheist parents raising a child, they're not going to raise them religiously, so they never were religious in the first place. Like I said, I'm not hating on religion. If you believe in God, good for you, I have no problem with it, nor should I.

2015-03-13T08:17:52,"It's unfortunate that Atheists make such an effort to seek out hypocritical, flakey so called ""Christians"" rather than the ones out there trying to emulate what they believe and to impart to others the truth of God's grace, not ""Judgement"". The heart of a true Christian is to simply care, serve and impart to others.. I won't lump all atheists together simply because many of the ones I see on blogs are hate mongering on Christians for their lack of tolerance, while missing the glaring contradictions in every aspect of their approach. I'm sure there are many intelligent Atheists out there that can impart their reasoning in a thoughtful and respectful way to other people, including Christians, without offending. Faith is a confusing issue for many people. And of course, many people have negative experiences within the church. It's human nature to foster the need for black and white constructs to protect ourselves from more hurt... which is why divorce rates only get higher after the failure of a first marriage. Rather than learning from the experience, people develop a more rigid approach to marriage and they become confined by those constructs. The truth is, you can't avoid getting hurt, all you can do is try to learn and grow from it. ¬†You can't run from the fact that their is suffering in the world, all you can do is try to lend a hand. You can't run from the fact that heartbreak comes to your door whether your looking for it or not. None of these things are simple to understand or define. I believe in God, but I can't prove He exists to a person that doesn't want to see Him in the gifts that life brings or want to see an ""angry"" God who hates homosexuals and so on.. I don't see God that way.I see God as merciful and gracious.. A God that states that ""His mercy endures forever.. and His mercies are new every morning"".. I believe the truth of the bible requires context, discernment and a desire to find truth to truly grasp the message and intent. Whether you believe in God or not.. Life is a mystery to us all. What I would want to make sure of is that I did everything I could to unravel the mystery of life, rather than simply dismissing the notion of God to justify such a short term existence. If Atheists are right.. there will be no way to ever gloat about it.. Unfortunately, if they are wrong... I believe God will ask one question of everyone.. Did you invest your whole heart in trying to find me before you gave up?

And then when we identify our own lack of commitment to the Saviour of the world; we can get to work. With the supreme importance of what is called the end game. The end game is a term that means winning the game at the end. We must get to work and commit ourselves unconditionally, to be as obedient to God and his commandments and laws as possible. Prior to making such a decision we have to always know with certainty that God loves us that he knows that we are human and that he understands and that he wants us to be happy. We should never be afraid of God because we are sinners and human. We are all going to sin. The effect of sin is alienation from God. All of this alienation, shame guilt etc, will be overcome because of the power of Love. Love is everything. Once you KNOW God simply wants to be your best friend at all times, then you will no longer be afraid. Your confidence will wax strong in his presence. So make a commitment to yourself to love yourself as best you can and to remember that God loves you more than you do and then get to work and commit yourself unconditionally to being the best son to him that you could possibly be. Be obedient to your Father in Heaven. Do what He asks you to do. Get to work-the 10 commandments is very practical advice. Priceless wisdom-the ""pearl of great price"".

Or just a frightened little kids who needs to learn to be more open about what you really are, and join the human race. Everyone has difficulties and pain and fear. Do not fear God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And find Him. He loves you. Within the sphere of influence called love, is happiness joy and laughter fun sheer delight and an attitude of goodwill towards all of our brothers and sisters on the planet. Just other humans doing life. Some are good and some are bad. If you are a bad person then none of what I am speaking about will interest you. Because I am talking about becoming a true follower of Jesus Christ. Or, if you don't want to consider yourself a follower of Jesus Christ. Then consider yourself a follower of good. Goodness here is what we're after. And goodness is always beautiful. So, if you like goodness you like it because it is beautiful. Or if you like beauty you like it because it is good. So make a decision to become a good person, a beautiful person. Then watch the cat approach you and purr while rubbing back and forth on your leg. When cats do that, they are giving Love and receiving Love. Both you and the cat gain-another way to describe what I mean is this: Then watch the Stars line up for you. Or another way to describe this is to simply say the universe will take care of you. Part of that care will be your own ability to recognize when they have interceded on your behalf. You must be able to recognize when the universe cares for you, because the universe wants you to know that  they are taking care of you. And the good that comes out of that for you will be that you will witness of it to others. That you will be able to say to other people that the universe takes care of you, that you are loved, that you are liked, that you are important to intelligent  beings. That they are with you to help you win your own race to be won. And you KNOW now, that you can only win your race by helping the human race with their race. Once you know this and speak about this with others ( as I can ), you will win. Your winning your race will not be at the expense of others losing their race. Your winning your race will happen because you helped others. You helped others to win their race. That is what the universe is wanting you to know. And it is the same with mere Christianity. Jesus Christ wants you to know that you will succeed in your personal life as you help others to succeed in their personal life. This is called: The Law of the Harvest. And to a Christian like me Jesus Christ is the Lord of the Harvest. He harvests us!!!!!!! All of creation, except ""darkness"" wants you to share in their joy-which is to know as they know-that you are IMPORTANT, that you are LOVED üëë",0,0,Dave,ogIX2Q7tEdc,0.3241379310344827,2015-04-17 20:10:28,False,True

Since the beginning, religion has done nothing but bring humans as a species down. It has caused endless pain and suffering world wide up until this day. Almost every religion encourages some form of murder, rape, genocide, slavery, or torture. It amazes me really that people believe they have the right to brainwash children from an early age when their minds are still developing. How do you think they come to believe things like the tooth fairy or santa claus? The same goes when they are taught to believe in a deity because their parents learned about it from their parents, and so on and so forth. They should be able to choose to believe in a religion if they think it is true and if it was right. Otherwise it should not be forced on to them. I despise almost every religion, but Christianity is the one I hate the most, because its followers seem to be the most brainwashed, close-minded, self-centered assholes I have ever met.

You will smell death and burning souls for eternity, while being eating alive by maggots for forever, <-- thats actually scripture. You wont even be able to cry out to Jesus because you will have no remembrance of him, bc he is hope and all things good and if you can think of Jesus than you could think of hope, but hope is of God and hell has no hope. I hope this message opens someones eyes to atleast rethink and try to attempt to find God, i pray that you do. Seek him with all your heart and YOU WILL FIND HIM. Dont turn away or desire to be apart from him, because that is what people who dont believe do, and he will give you that exact wish an you be lost forever in hell. Be blessed my friends, i love you.

Do any believers here relate at all to the sense of incincerity and inauthenticity of such a statement, made by the doctor character?  It's one thing to believe in miricles, but why strawman this point that is made by critics of religion? In essence, what's often said, and I would stand behind, is that doctors and researchers of medicine are denied credit when people see the healing of their loved ones as a miricle. All credit is instead given to an invisible being.   In the real trauma of such situations, it's inappropriate to correct them, just as it should be seen as inappropriate for evangelists to target converting people in such times of weakness.  Do you really believe that an Atheist doctor would say such a thing without a humorous tone? Not a blogger or commenting critic of religion,  but a doctor? Really?  Does it not feel the slightest bit deceitful of the creators of this movie to pretend and imply that a doctor wants to be seen as a god, just because some people think that doctors deserve more credit?

2015-10-23T17:16:11,"What did you do as little kids, afraid of the thought of monsters under your Bed? YOU TRIED YOUR HARDEST TO BELIEVE THAT THEY DID NOT EXIST! That is all you guys are doing. You fear God, you fear reality, and you live in your bubble of ignorance. You try everything you can to discredit God, so you can continue on in an illusion. Now, for the person struggling to believe, that's different, you seek the truth, the greatest thing you can do. But for those who just reject, slander, critically judge and point fingers, all you are doing is displaying your ignorance. It's a twisted and backwards world we live, I feel compassion of the person who rejects God, it's sad, because they do not know what they're missing, and what they will miss out on forever more. You know, I see so many atheists enjoying the gifts of God. Snow boarding, animals, sports, pets, beachs, swimming. Etc, all the gifts God has given us. The creation is the reality of God in front of you. You atheists love strawberries, and fruit, and food, you love tasting, and eating, and sleeping and your pleasure. But you hate God. God is good! All of creation testifies that. God is good to the evil, and the just. We are in the grace period of history right now, Jesus does not want anyone to perish, but all to awaken. As do I. But it's difficult speaking to a brick wall. You guys hate God, because you learned about God from his enemy. You learned about God from television, cartoons, music, false perceptions of churches, and ""education"" system and a bunch of man-written text books, and you think all of a sudden we can discredit God. Awaken to our reality. I know it is hard, we all stumble in many ways. God Bless all you. Great movie by the way.",3,4,Servant Jason,ogIX2Q7tEdc,0.034081246134817555,2015-10-23 17:16:11,False,False

2016-01-18T13:03:27,"excuse me all atheist please if you don't care or don't believe in God or his existence well then why bother being rude and making jokes about something that according to you doesn't exist.that's kinda of sily making fun of something that you think is not real. Not all christians by the way are fakes the bible does speak of false teachers, hypocrites,false religion,and wolves under sheeps clothing so even Jesus talked about that but not everyone's like that. im sorry if you atheist have been judged harshly and hurt by so called ""Christians"".  being christian don't mean being perfect it means depending on Christ and everything trying to be like Christ not actually be him because he is perfect but if you so called Christians are not even close to this good humble loving behavior your not a christian you just believe and God and the bible saids even the devil believes in God. Now don't get me wrong no ones compared to Satan but its a way of saying that you need to check your christian attitude. Now athesit, I'm not judging athiest or  condemning you guys I respect everyone and in not who to judge. I have atheist friends they respect me and I respect them. those atheist who make dumb comments about Christians are just immature or maybe do believe there's a God but just hate him and deny his existence. I hope you guys examine yourselfs and your behavior and be  more respectful. Religion  seperates people because most religious people use force and hate. Jesus and Gandhi used loved and peace. I'm christian not Buddhist but I do agree if Jesus and ghandi got together they agree on that. I don't even consider myself a religious person I simply believe that having a relationship with Christ is a beautiful thing that gives salvation which to me salvation is a life of peace and so much faith that even in trouble I pray and God gives me peace of mind. Religion saids obey God and you wont go to hell ridiculous! I believe in God because I love him and respect him not because of fear. God doesn't condem no one our bad actions and words condem ourselfs. Religion forces you and brain washes you to thinking your more righteous than others agg Yea bad!! A Real true beautiful relationship with Christ changes your heart and makes you humble and understanding and your thoughts change not because your Good but because God is good. we are saved by grace not by are own actions. I make mistakes that's y I don't like judging or making others believe I'm self righteous. I'm still a sinner only difference is that I'm a redeemed and forgiven sinner. God is righteous not me and that y I depend on him to be a better person each day.Religion to me is just ridiculous and I know y'all saying that being a Christian or what I believe is religion but idk I just explained the difference. feed the poor,attend the sick and have love and forgive and do what is right not because you have to but because you feel that good in you then if you do that you can tell me that your religion is true if not not actions speak louder than words. Religion is tradition of man and only believes what's convenient or what you want to believe. And you can belive in the wrong thing and wont be saved. I believe in the truth which is love and all Good Faith that leads to good acts and I have not found that in any religion or church but only by having a relationship through Christ. Church dont save you either. I only go to church for fellowship(spiritual family supporting eachother) because the Lord loves unity and harmony and having a nice worship service to God. But I find Christ in my heart and every day through prayer and reading the bible. salvation is a personal and individual.",33,1,Mireya B,ogIX2Q7tEdc,0.1223639455782313,2016-01-18 13:03:27,False,False
