This was a successful formula back then, but today, people seek a more realistic approach... A movie about the possibility of the existence of the Megalodon is great, but doesn't mean it has to be a Shark-zilla, neither in size or everything else. It can be a horrifying movie that will give you chills without the need for over-exaggeration.   Futuristic research lab doesn't add any value...

Sure the ocean is big and have more mystery on it but I don't believe a million years old big-ass shark managed to survived till now. A lot of changes happen during all those times like the circulation of the ocean temperature and currents that affect living organisms. Quite sometimes that something weird is brought upon by witness that fares in the big blue.  I do in fact have a hypothesis that a prehistoric shark may survived with a unique adaptation to the environment like mostly in cold deeper waters. Not big though like an 18 meters (59 ft) fish but somehow in medium-bigger size than today Great White Shark. If this kind of shark do managed to survived, I would think its mostly around the South Pacific where its the best place remain secluded and unknown to others to find out.",0,0,Rogue Ascendant,udm5jUA-2bs,0.19843750000000002,2018-04-19 14:16:32,True,True

Jaws came out in 1975 & nothing has or ever will even come close its classic greatness.,0,0,Catface91,udm5jUA-2bs,0.053333333333333344,2018-04-23 19:21:18,True,True

Now they have a stupid ass movie with a colossal shark. Before that it was sharks that were super-intelligent. As if the actual sharks that are in the water right now are not frightening enough. The movie makers need to make a decent movie in which the shark isn't blown up or some stupid ass thing like that; a movie that has an actuall story and real suspense.

Steve Alten's books have been waiting for their chance to go to the big screen for a loooong time and I feel like this movie was a squandered chance to make that happen. Instead of using the great material they had from the books, Hollywood had to go and give it their treatment.

If I remember correctly, megalodon lived during the ice age period and feasted on pretty big preys. (Like the too scary for humans like prey)  It could still be possible that it lives in deep oceans as the temperature there could support it. Same goes for the preys it feasts upon.   It should not be sharkenly possible for megalodon to swim in the shallower parts of the ocean. It would just die.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúROBUX‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

If I ended up going to see this film (which I'm not) I wouldn't feel an ounce of suspense. Jaws set the standard on how to make a suspenseful shark flick.  The official theatrical trailer is also a big tease if you look at it in context (pretend you never heard of or seen the film). you dont see one inch of that shark's face, nor do you see it visibly attacking anyone. You're left to wonder what it looks like and what else it does - you essentially have to go to the cinema to find out yourself.  The Meg, on the other hand, was already shown to me.  I know what the shark looks like, I know who the characters are and I know the shark gets killed at the end on a particular scene, because this is what movie trailers do and I have absolutely no idea why I even try to give them the benefit of the doubt every time.  i am avoiding this",0,0,GB Gaming,udm5jUA-2bs,-0.015277777777777779,2018-08-01 19:53:19,True,True

You can tell the movie was filmed in a giant pool for most scenes. The CGI was not the best , but it was the best it could be for a B movie shark flick, however this was not a cheap B movie it was an expensive $150 million dollar flop. Deep blue sea is by far better as is the original Jaws. If they used animatronics for this movie you would probably be looking at a $500 million dollar budget. The story line was stupid but it has some very nice scenes and funny punch lines. Megalodon was 70-90 feet? Megalodon feared nothing? Hahaha Only 2 references made to the Killer whales, the creatures responsible in part for megalodon extinction.

I just wanted to see people get eaten by a shark and that didn't even happen. Essentially it was a movie put together by the PC diversity police. Every single ethnic group was represented by the lab team and because they were representing their ethnic groups they were sacred cows that we couldn't kill throughout the movie. The Dog didn't even die! What should have happened is everybody on that boat should have died except for the cute Asian girl her daughter and Jason Statham. And everybody else should have had horrific gruesome deaths to let you know how terrifying the shark was. But people were dying from other causes other than the shark it was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters period. I didn't see anybody chopped in half I didn't see anybody eaten not even in graphic or gruesome detail just enough to see some blood in the water it was pretty terrible,0,0,Cory F,udm5jUA-2bs,-0.35974702380952384,2018-08-11 03:18:54,False,True

Here's the review:  First half it's literally Deep Blue Sea; bringing Science into their exploration, but not skipping the usual mainstream stupidity that every scientific institute loves to incorporate; or let us say the ""Hollywood directors"" into their movie. üåö - Vacation yacht is the way to hunt a Megladon; already knowing its sheer size. A slim hook, some falling over from the boat into water, a lucky escape or misfortune here and there, you know the usual scenes... cuz, Science B**ch! üåö  Second Half: Alright, enough with the science, we take the direction towards ""Jaws"" now. The usual crowded beach, cuz how else would we justify that Megladon/shark is evil, and love munching on little snacks... - Oh wait, we MUST add a helpless dog, a fat boy who loves licking on a Popsicle more than listening to his mom, or his own life. Voila, now this completed our mainstream ""shark movie"" touch.  But wait, what about adding helicopters? Some gun firing(cuz a bazooka is too expensive I guess), and let's not tell our military cuz they are busy protecting our borders; we must send stupid people who can't fly, like every UFO crashing conspiracy theory.   Hmmm... I guess this completes our movie jam packed with mumbo-jumbo! Let the audience feel stupid now. Cuz, the movie had no scope, scientific theory//approach. Just plain stupidity. üåö",2,1,Kitty S,udm5jUA-2bs,-0.14532019704433494,2018-08-13 04:30:09,False,True

A man who has everything.  Can do anything.  Can be anything.  so they chose The World's Fattest Man.   In order to give the worlds fattest man true courage, the US government paid 1 Billion Dollars to any and all sexy celebrity women who would sleep with the world's fattest man.   Once sexing all the women of his dreams, the world's fattest man (henceforth referred to as the worlds fattest man or 1tonstramrolleverything) had nothing to lose.  He then, of course, agreed to go on a One Man Suicide Mission to Mars.  To Save Us All.   The Rocket that carried 1tonsteamrolleverything to his destination was the B-128-22--1-n!. Shaped like a coconut crab, and sprayed top down with internet memes, the craft was deemed invincible.  Inside The Craft the worlds fattest man would ride around is in Rascall, or simply SteamRoll in small spurts to get around, eat, or sex the many many women provided by the holodeck.  Upon landing, 1tonsteamrolleverything looked up at the Sun and began his long trek to the top of Olympus Mons.   The entire world watched him, we laughed, cried, and Anne Hathaway said that she would never ware underware again in his honor.   eventually the worlds fattest man reached his destination.   NASA said, ""OK 1ton, it's time to do your thing, good luck and godspeed""  He said ""STEEEAAAMMMMROOOOLLLLLL EVVVVEEERRYYYYTHIINNGG!!!""   Then he bit down on all the yummy cyanide pills he could, detonated the Nuke, and SteamRolled.   He rolled on  and on  and on and on  and saved us all.  And so everyone on Earth got attractive and then got liad.  And freedom and food and drugs populated the world.  and Rainbows, everywhere.  The Universe was conqured much sooner than thought as a result.  The govt made catgirls and everyone liked that too.   Thank you sexy celebrity women  Thank you worlds fattest man.   One day we to will learn to SteamRoll, perhaps on Earth too.  We will teach our children, and our childrens children what ne can really do the second they hit 1 Ton.

2018-12-28T20:25:08,"Spoiler Alert:  The animations on 4k showcasing the Megalodon looks great. But the movie is a bit of cliche, there are close calls where they should have been eaten, but I get it LOL there would be no movie at all depending on how you see it, but there was this amazing part where they felt the had caught and killed the Megalodon, and boom!!! there was a bigger and greater one eating a smaller one like it was desert it is amazing how it jumped from the water to get to other shark hanging like a piece of meat. Anyways I don't want to spoil it for everyone, SO PLEASE DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HADN'T SEEN IT. PLease wait for it to hit Netflix, now this movie doesn't have the shocking edge like The Reef, not the cartoon but the realist title check it out if you hadn't that puts Open Water to shame in ways I believe but we all have different opinions so don't be offended by this written review if you don't like what I have to say. I do believe shark movie lovers deserve better this title is not bad nor is it good. Be the judge for your self I am so glad I got this from Redbox.

2019-04-06T01:35:19,"*AVOID THIS MOVIE*  What an absolute cluster fuck of a movie. Where do I even begin with this one. A couple minutes into the movie I was cringing so hard in my seat and knew it was going to be the same throughout. But I relunctanty carried on.   The characters and their acting were awful and showed little to no emotion throughout the film, sometimes not even mourning the death of their friends for more than a few minutes or not even panicking when in the water or on the boat when there is a huge megaladon lurking in the water?   There was little to no suspense in the film and each scene was extremely predictable.   Also the IQ of the characters were extremely questionable throughout and quite laughable. Like multiple people falling off boats by standing at the back edge of them and dumb helicopter pilots, who can‚Äôt keep their eyes open and end up crashing into each other? And someone bright idea to send a couple of tiny little submarines the size of a car to take out a huge shark that is the length of a ship? And what happened to the chinese destroyers that we‚Äôre meant to be on their way? Could have been a lot safer and logical?   And talking about characters, do all blockbuster films these days need to have a character of every single different ethnicity they can think of. Do they purposely do this just to tick all the boxes so everyone is pleased in the mainstream? It‚Äôs super unrealistic and super cringe.   I have probably missed some other dumb things but this movie was quite frankly terrible, boring, predictable and extremely cliche.

Sharks need to continue to move to be able to breathe in the water so if you are skinny (not like a stick you can be cubby just no fat) the shark may attack you but if you put up a fight it will not waste its time on something that will provide low calories.
