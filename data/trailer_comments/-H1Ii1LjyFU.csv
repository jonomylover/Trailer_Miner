2016-11-23T02:25:47,"So I haven't seen the movie just the trailer and read a review. I would like to see it because I am addicted to movies that make you question your lost dreams, inner motivations or regrets but here's what I am going to assume and now rush to the theater to learn... the real story, the only story is Edward and Susan. Edward who was admidtly a sensitive and empassioned yet mentally trapped writer suffered great loss when Susan abandoned him for being the very man she fell in love with and left. He not only suffered the loss of the relationship he suffered the loss of his sensitive soul. He became hardened by the reality of what it feels like to be accused of being less than and letting a love fall apart if you are not careful with it. It is that same visceral emotion one feels when your loved ones are violently ripped away from you. It is a metaphor. Susan left, this hardened Edward and forced him to confront his demons by writing the book. The same demons it takes to confront evil and seek justice for your family. Tony dying represents how nothing was gained by trying to fight for what you love and a piece of him died that day. When she made the decision to leave the marriage she created the ripple that would result in her never having the love that she could have had with Edward. He leaves her sitting in the empty restaurant to drive home the point that their love, her hope, her essence, once flowering and beautiful, is now dead. That's my pop analysis of the film and I would love to see it. The story we tell ourselves in our heads, in this case on paper, is always more captivating than the reality but it doesn't make it any less genuine or painful.

2017-03-19T14:52:21,"It goes without saying: Tom Ford's poignant, and grim drama Nocturnal Animals is one of the most spiritual movies ever made. Not only does Nocturnal Animals revolve around a series of events that are disturbing, but the execution of the story is incredibly thoughtful, and yet ironically just logical. What makes Nocturnal Animals¬†particularly relevant, is that it's a case of the ability of logic being¬†the theme of the movie. More¬†precisely, Tom Ford's drama is about the war between the link between morality and reality's origin and the ability of that link. On the surface, Nocturnal Animals can come across as a nuanced story about revenge, and guilt, however, at a deeper level the film is an exploration of the immorality of empathy, because¬†for empathy to be valid that meant that empathy always needed to be a reaction to something valid (in this instance, the absurdity of logic being the deaths of Laura and India Hastings).¬†Regardless of the actual plot, an interpretation of Nocturnal Animals is that each of its events are part of a chain, and that the chain is an examination of the¬†identity of the moral perspective. Throughout the story,¬†characters react, and they have perspective. And while this in itself would seem a pointless thing to point out, because¬†of the uniformity relative to other stories and movies,¬†the uniformity is destroyed because of the sense that the perspectives and reactions throughout the film are in fact¬†counter-productive to the conventional morality of the movie's events.¬†Susan, played brilliantly by Amy Adams, and Gyllenhaal's Tony Hastings share a pattern of visual symmetry from start to finish,¬†while at the same time¬†both¬†being part of opposite realities as the intended theme seems the wrong interpretation: the self-awareness of Nocturnal Animals could be that its mission is to justify the isolation represented by Susan and Tony.¬†Susan's visceral reactions to the story of Tony¬†are moral, but not the¬†moral perspective. Of course, Susan's perspective on the story sent to her by Edward is the conventional morality, and thus the point of Nocturnal Animals is to understand the true¬†significance of reaction. The horror, and the gruesome events that define the life of Tony Hastings¬†need the capitalist lifestyle that Susan's life is defined by,¬†and yet oddly, the¬†intelligence of Nocturnal Animals is to understand that the capitalist system is the creator of¬†empathy - reality's symbiosis. And even within the context that capitalism as empathy's creator is an inevitable thus pointless understanding, somehow, Nocturnal Animals just plays so that its mission isn't pointless. The very iimage, the very moment of the discovery of the corpses of Laura and India is a perfect, root demonstration of the concept of conundrum. Fascinatingly, if the argument of Nocturnal Animals is that the moral perspective is synonymous with the concept of conundrum, the issue becomes how to perceive the individual chains throughout the movie. Again, perhaps this can be tied to the point about the inherent power of Nocturnal Animals simply being the impossibility of irrelevance. At heart, this movie is a masterful display of storytelling, the kind of movie that doesn't just put other movies to shame, but which actually makes¬†many other movies¬†immoral.",4,0,Thomas h cullen,-H1Ii1LjyFU,0.07551406926406928,2017-03-19 14:52:21,False,False

2018-05-20T10:36:45,"This film is an artistic masterpiece. We have a brilliant cast, a brilliant director and a perfect story line that many people can relate to. It shows the antithesis of creative and neurotic minds through the portrayal of Amy Adams character, Susan. It really makes you think, and what Amy said that the start about it being a cautionary tale is so true. Susan‚Äôs character is a strong character with a good mask that she hides behind. The fact that she gave up her true love for someone that doesn‚Äôt love her but has a lot of power and money really shows the human condition. Films like this are priceless, after watching this film it made me think of other brilliant films like ‚ÄòWe Need To Talk About Kevin‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Killing of a Sacred Deer‚Äô. The moment when Susan at the end of the film realises the extent of her cruel decision was the perfect ending, you can see the emotion in her eyes as she is filled with existential dread.   Jake‚Äôs character, Edward Sheffield was a brilliant. Two of the best actors of our time. Roberto Andes would‚Äôve been so much better if either Rami Melik or Christian Slater had played it. And Ray Marcus would really suit Jared Letto too.   Toms message of not throwing away people you love is such a strong one that we can all relate to. Truly an admirable director. And the director of photography was perfect for the role. The colour tones in this were perfect, the grain and grit really boosts the overall experience and weight of the film, the colour tones are just as important as the story itself. The way they have used Photography and Cinematography is perfect.   Truly a flawless film, I can‚Äôt think of anything that I didn‚Äôt like in this.

2020-05-14T17:24:52,Here's something really strange that I've noticed. I've gone through nearly a dozen of Gyllenhaal's movies and none of them have this guy saying more than 3 words in any scene. Other co-stars have normal lines that are at least a sentence or two long but not him. It's always a one word answer or no answer at all. Amazing how he's able to be an A list (not really) actor but never have to say anything in his movies.,0,0,Sage Land,-H1Ii1LjyFU,0.12250000000000001,2020-05-14 17:24:52,False,False
