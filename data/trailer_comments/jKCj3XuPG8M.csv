It's an incredibly good movie, full of action, explosions and humor, that's why everyone loves this film. Then after a few years we watched the 2nd part and our love increased even more. I can't even say how many times I've watched 2 parts of Bad Boys with my brother. I will always associate Bad Boys with the amazing childhood I spent with my twin brother, and Mike and Marcus with the best duo of cops. Now, finally, we have three parts, which everyone has been waiting for so long. Bad Boys for life is also amazing, full of action, explosions and humor, I'm glad it was created.

"""""""""""""""""""""""" Spoiler Alert """"""""""""""""""""""""    - You ruined the classic rotating slow motion scene that always came after an intense chase. I mean wtf. The action of the scene itself is a filler for the first two movies.  - Having a background story for Mike is not a bad idea. A VooDoo mother and a mexican son... foreal? I think a kid could come up with a plot like this. The movie followed Fast and Furious' franchise condemned way with all the dark background stories and enemies from the past shit.  - Martin Lawrence could shine a lot more even in the shape he is right now. He was always a thug cop and he should have his awesome old school moments.  - Bringing a team is not a bad idea. They should be fillers though and not so mainly active.  - Two partners from the police station missing.... Mother jokes would still be hilarious  - It was a good chance to see Julie again. Maybe her being in secret services and maybe leading the support team for the guys.  - Seeing Reggie marrying Megan was one of the best flowing things and a very nice add. Although I would like to have Marcus' two sons being active and who knows maybe following father's steps?  - THERE WAS NO FKING REASON TO KILL THE CAPTAIN. Bad Boys has always been bloody and dark a few times but a role that breaks the line between comedy and action should have been protected FFS.
