For example in the show, Girl A and Guy B are lovers from the future. However, it was revealed that girl A came back from a different future than guy B, thus she remembered stuff that happened to guy B in her timeline while it didn't happen to guy B in his own timeline.  Coming back to the Terminator movies, it is fine that they are doing this ""reboot"" movie as we all have to understand the implications of time travel.  Also, many people said that Salvation was crap...but i really liked it because they were starting to show what happens further into the future. I know terminator is meant to be about the past, about sarah and john, but I for one would definitely want to watch movies on what happens in the future. Or at least one of the possible futures, before someone else screws the timeline again. I want to watch the war with the robots, I want to watch the end of skynet. And maybe in the end credits scene, the said future will be erased and we don't know what the new future will be (because of things happening in the past). I wish they would take the franchise into this aspect.  And maybe it's about time to change the new mascott for the T-800. Arnie can be his old self, but I would prefer if they don't use a ""young arnie CGI"" for the new T-800s. For example they could send back John Cena or I dunno, Dave Bautista.

I mean there is almost no point in seeing this movie now. Who's bright idea was it to completely neuter this movie before it even came out. I don't mind the twist, if I'm not mistaken this is similar to the original ending of Terminator Salvation that would had made the film more interesting. Still, I don't get the reasoning in doing this in the trailer, it's either, A) They have a better twist, other then the curve ball they already did with Sarah Connor was the one protected by the T-800, like Matt Smith is actually the Doctor the whole time and has to be the one to fix this crap. I'm kidding of course, but I highly doubt that they have anything else to show us. B) They were asked to make a second trailer and was told to show something new, well, if so they ultimately failed! I mean if you have nothing else to show other then this, then don't do it! The first trailer was honestly all we needed it was enough of a hook, a very weak hook mind you, but it was enough. All you have to do is do what others this year has done way better then you, like Avengers they have shown enough for us to want to go see it by giving us glimpses of Vision not out right telling us who he is and what he's going to do. C) They don't give a crap, this is going end up like A Good Day to Die Hard, but for Terminator, sadly Jai Courtney was in both of those franchise killing movies and I don't hate the guy but seriously, bad luck man.

Terminator Kyle Reese faked his own death in the original movie, so he could keep tabs on every mistake Skynet makes throughout history in order to change things on the next iteration as well as preserving Skynet.  Skynet Plan 103: Have 2 time machines at different locations in order to keep sending Terminators back in time.  Skynet Plan 104: Have a secret moon base in order to preserve Skynet.  Skynet Plan 105: Have a secret underwater base at the deepest floor in the ocean, so no human can get there in order to preserve Skynet.

2015-04-14T22:11:07,"Everyone's got their opinions on how the plot should go forward and such..... but this is my idea on how it should've went. The John Connor we see fighting the good fight in the future has had the Terminator from T2 story, experienced events from Salvation , (let's just ignore T-3 ) and knows he's gotta send Kyle back to hook up with his mom, and knows he's gotta send a Terminator to protect young John. But experiencing all the crap he's been through, he sends another Terminator prior to the one that wants to kill Sarah from the T1 story line,  and the ""old Arnold Terminator"" defeats and reprograms the Terminator that was going to kill Sarah. When the T-1000 comes to kill John in the T2 story line, now it's  got face 2 T-800's. The shock and awe should be the Skynet also figures out somehow what's going on, and send the additional T-1000 it created the help it's fellow creation to take out the T-800's. (The lore is that Skynet created 2 T-1000's... but they were so advanced and self aware that Skynet implanted a self destruction device in them so they would perform a self termination once John was dead...because eventually the T-1000's would determine that human life was just as important as machine life and turn against Skynet, which was intent on killing all humans). So, the 4 terminators battle it all out and in the end one of the T-800 damages a T-1000 and it eventually becomes aware of the flaw in Skynet and joins John's cause. Now Sarah and John have a T-1000 on their side and the role for a new, but acceptable terminator role, can be passed from Arnold to a new and younger actor who could be a T-1000 instead of the Arnoldish T-800. I feel like adding in a different type of terminator every single movie is getting really old and making fans struggle to stay interested. Keep it simple Hollywood. 2 types of terminators built off the film's that won us over. Want to do a time jump thing again?? Ok, but stop committing character integrity suicide every dang time.

Machine John is the main antagonist of the movie(Like t800 in T1, T1000 in T2 and T-X in T3). I'm guessing history is being rewrited here by the T800 going back to the 60's and raising and training Sarah since her chilhood(as seeing on trailer 1 but NOT in trailer 2). Who sent back the t800 to the 60's, and why? Those are the plot major conduits we didn't see on the trailers.  By the way, Machine John is nothing but a improved T-X of some kind, probably developed after researchs made on Marcus Wright. Maybe T-X from T3 is the same too. I know when T3 was made, they had no idea about Salvation, but maybe Genisys could fix those plot holes and make the story even better.  Genisys(the word) should be considered VERY important as well.

2015-05-09T23:58:46,"Ending prediction: After Sarah, Kyle and the Terminator kill John, they realize that the only way to reverse what happened to John is by stopping him from turning himself into the machine he becomes. So in order to do this the 3 of them must tell john that when he is given the offer to change himself into the machine he must decline it in order to save his mother and Kyle. So the 3 of them raise John to be a military leader and tell him to never turn himself into the machine he became. (Heres where I think it will get interesting) When the war begins Kyle and Sarah are killed and the Terminator and John survive. As the war goes on, Johns plan is to send the Terminator he currently has with him, back in time to protect his mother from a very young age (like the movie showed) John wants to do this because he feels that its the way things have to be because he thinks he has to replicate the past. But then the Terminator John has with him is destroyed/killed during the war which makes John afraid for his mother because he knows the terminator is not there to protect her because it was never sent by him. Then finally when the day comes where Skynet sends the terminator back in time to kill his mother, he knows that there is no terminator waiting for that terminator in Los Angeles. Which is when Kyle volunteers to go back in time and kill the terminator because Kyle has no other choice because he has no terminator to send. So then Kyle is sent back in time to kill the terminator Skynet sent to kill Sarah. Then all of this sets in motion the original terminator movies 1,2,3 and John never shows up because he didn't become the machine we see in the movie because he knows it will endanger his mother.

2015-05-18T05:23:03,"I am excited for this movie! That being said I have some complaints. Salvation ruined the surprise of the T-800 prototype (Marcus Wright/Sam Worthington) just as they kinda spoiled this. The fun of Terminator is finding out the evolution of the machines as well as Skynets plan itself to end humanity. Hopefully they have more shocking things to add to this John Connor thing. Such as the reason the future has been dramatically altered is because he did not die in Salvation as the Terminator in T3 said he would this changing the whole future. Another issue of mine is a big one. SHOW US THE WAR WITH THE MACHINES!!! Though Salvation technically did this it is not the one that we, the fans, were shown in the first terminator and hell the glimpses we see in T2 and T3. Take us there. Make a show out of it with more care than Sarah Connor Chronicles. They could have a show on how the Resistance is fighting in the 2027 future to recover Intel located in a heavily armed skynet base. Then as they eventually fight a battle at the base someone from the resistance can download Intel from skynet showing there is a plan to send the terminator back to the past to kill Sarah. By doing this you could show us the war we have wanted to see and tie it in so it can kick off the events of this movie. Just show it a lot of love and care and review the movies so it does not step on the toes of the foundation that has been established. Salvation did this because the year was 2018 when John Connor nearly died by the T-800. In T3 they stated it was 2032 that John Connor died at the hands of the T-800. This stuff being said I am still excited to see how this all plays out. Those are just some personal feelings of mine that they could go with it.

Shortly after they sent Reese back, the resistance of his timeline is overrun and John Conner is turned into a cyborg Terminator and sent back in time to kill Sarah Conner before he is born.

2015-05-27T13:57:58,"Way to give up all the goods in the trailer.  This is going to be the stupidest movie ever. I can already see the plothole gaping through the entire movie, just from the trailer.  How does John Connor, the future savior of the human race, and the horrible Frankenstein creation ever get born if Kyle and Sarah don't hook up? Are they going to retcon the entire story and say she just squirted him out from a random guy at a truck stop months before the old Arnold model came back in time to say that the kid she just pooped out is important? That makes no sense.  Ostensibly, she has to have sex with Kyle at least once, but if she already knows the future, as the trailer implies, why would she? Why bring a doomed child into the world? And if she doesn't do that in the movie, then how is there a villain? And why get pregnant with a guy and then birth and raise a baby into a man that will become a cyborg monster? Why not just skip all the labor pains, and the kicking, and weird cravings, and just not have a baby at all. Sure, you can still have sex with Kyle, just use protection.  And the Frankenstein angle doesn't make any sense either. Why would a machine try to terminate a dude that becomes a machine to further your own evolution as a machine? For machines, evolution means upgrades, not obsolescence, why would John Connor be a threat, so why would there be terminators there in the first place?  Lastly, SkyNet is a joke. It is a computer that learns how to take over the internet and murder the world, and invent time travel, and cyborgs, and whatever those liquid things are, but a few dudes with some rusted out old jeeps and some old weapons are going to take down this system?

Oh well I quess that's what's the going thing like all the other older movies they try to remake they hype them up. Like the Texas chainsaw massacre they wore that out then Friday 13th and now they brought out this poltergeist movie. No wonder I stick with the older ones there more like down to earth not a bunch of computer makeup.,1,0,BRENDAJASON1,jNU_jrPxs-0,0.09606481481481478,2015-05-29 16:41:05,True,True

2015-06-08T19:47:20,No what's sad is I have the feeling John is a Terminator only for the point that they can rip off George Orwells 1984 which came out in the same year as terminator. It's is also about a future society. Which had a leader of a rebel group that was an undercover agent. Setting up the people wanting to break free of their hell to their dooms.      He's obviously not the good guy in the story anymore based on this trailer. The widely known good terminator shoots him right off the bat. Seemingly to just have a bad guy monologuing moment. What also gets me is the ripping off just enough cyborg flesh to reveal the terminator eye...... 3 different times in the trailer alone. When your movie thinks it's ground breaking because it is making non stop cliches.... out of your own source material.... you failed!       Then there is the time traveling issues topped with the inconsistencies of James Cameron. Mixed with the Cannon fodder of the spin of series. Which good terminator is it? By the time Sara is 20 the t-800 is already old. In the movies there are only 2 good terminators. Both were destroyed.

I  was  extremely annoyed...  and especially disappointed with   Arnold  Schwarzenegger  for  stooping so low,  as to drag his legendary action hero persona through one more substandard, B-Class, lackluster sequel. My opinion has always been that Terminator 2 was the best, and rightly so, last showing of the post apocalyptic Machine vs. Human action/ adventure.  Ever since "" Judgment Day "",  each sequel has proven worse than the last, with the exception of  "" Terminator Salvation "".  Terminator warped my imagination as a child of 6 1/2  years old... Consequently I've always been weary of overpowered computers, and the location setting being turned on in my smart phone! lol.  So... As a self-qualified sci-fi critic I am compelled to speak my mind regarding the latest installment of....  "" The Terminator ""                 The trailer looks EPIC!   I  admittedly  haven't  been so excited to see Arnold on screen since... Well... EVER!!!  LOL  "" Salvation "" only had a couple scenes with his digitally remastered younger self doing battle in the inner sanctum of Skynet. So watching his not-so-young version running around with a sawed-off shotgun is pretty awesome. We see the younger Arnold as well, though obviously the bad, programmed to kill Sarah model. A newer  T-1000 bad guy has been added to the mix... Again intending to terminate Sarah, and Kyle Reese I presume. This brings me to the VERY BEST aspect of the movie........           --->  Emilia Clarke  <----          ........ Playing  the role of Sarah Connor!!!  GET  THE  FUDGE  OUT!!!   Absolutely fantastic choice for Sarah's dynamic personality, her stunning and intense looks, her powerful and inspirational lines... I agree with the casting choices 100%  so far as I've seen. I love the looks of the CGI in this trailer. The plot seems to be reasonable, considering each attempt to date resulted in the machines failing to terminate Sarah, John, Kyle... Even the reprogrammed terminator has been reincarnated and survives to protect the gang!  So... I approve, I'm excited, the Khaleesi is super-duper hot, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a pimp, and a movie I thought I hated is turning out to be the best sequel ever created!

2015-06-13T11:24:32,"This looks terrible. They should have followed plot rules, like they did for Star Wars, where all sequels, books, computer games etc. have to fit in with the original plot. In Terminator 1, there was a time loop. Skynet allowed itself to be created when the T-800 was destroyed in the factory, owned by Cyberdyne and the chip was found by one of the employees, meaning the future is set, partially because the future was also the past. In T2, they changed that by saying ""The future is not set, there's no fate, but what we make"". T3 changed it further, by having the ware start in the early 2000s, instead of 1997. Terminator Salvation jumped far too quickly into the future, when there needed to be another couple of movies in between. They also did major screw-ups and plot changes, such as having the cyborg dude created in a human-created lab, prior to Skynet taking over, when cyborgs were supposed to have been designed by Sknyet in 2029. Also, despite T3 having the war start later, in Salvation, they had the T-800 cyborg created much earlier, in 2018, when it shouldn't have appeared until the mid 2030s, due to the later start of the war, in T3.",0,0,jublywubly,jNU_jrPxs-0,-0.004960317460317461,2015-06-13 11:24:32,True,True

That's the option - their sons sction might cause the death of them both. 1:18. I hope at the end they make the full recovery of John and send him back to the future. The contact with the future must be done through Arnold's Body Sacrifice - the elements needed to make the contact - and the whole process of John Connor started while he made himself go through the portal - so the only way to reverse it is to go back to the future.

The book was originally published in hardcover by Simon and Schuster in September 1964, and in paperback by Pocket Books in August 1965. Later paperback editions were published by Award Books in 1974 and Ace Books in 1978 and 1984; the novel was also reprinted in the collection Keith Laumer: the Lighter Side, published by Baen Books in 2002, and in an omnibus edition with Poul Anderson's Inside Earth as A Hoax in Time/Inside Earth (Armchair Fiction Double Novel #31), published by Armchair Fiction in 2011.

2015-07-05T08:52:44,"My review, spoiler free. (2/2) The Nostalgia: As an avid (rabid...) fan of the first two movies, and having rewatched them (yet again) shortly before seeing Genisys, I was expecting and consequently looking for references to the first two films. They were plentiful, and many were subtle. Some major events, such as the scene in the trailer where Sarah rescues Kyle Reese (""Come with me if you want to live. Now, soldier!"") and the old T-800 versus the new T-800 (""I've been waiting for you."") were obviously not subtle. But they were awesome to watch, awesome to remember those moments from T1 and see how they've changed their path due to more time traveling events since T2. The less subtle ones were enjoyable as well, however. And I don't think the average watcher of Genisys will catch even half of the subtler ones (such as a thumbs up from the old T-800 to Sarah Connor-- this is the last thing she saw of the Arnold's T2 character, as he was lowered into the steal-- near the very beginning of the film; as well as throwbacks to T2's Terminator arm, obtained by Cyberdyne by the factory that Sarah and Kyle killed the original T-800 Arnold Terminator in at the end of T1).  The story: This is easily, no question, the best plot from a Terminator movie since T2. It twists and turns but never leaves you confused. For those that don't understand every minute detail (mostly people who haven't seen T1 in up to 30 years), the story is still understandable enough to enjoy. It's extremely creative, extremely engaging, and just good writing. I never felt like it was juggling too many things at once. The pacing was not only perfect, but the sequences played out very much like the Terminator movie it is. You can easily compare T1 and T2 (even T3's) structure to Genisys' structure, which helps with that nostalgia and with giving you the same feelings of tenseness, curiosity, awe, and appreciation for the cleverness as when you watched the first two. Though, of course, T1 and T2 are superior films, no matter how engaging Genisys is. But I expected that and it didn't ruin the experience for me. The time travel twist when Kyle goes back, what he sees, how that affects the path of this movie, was done very well, leading to unexpected turns in the plot. The actors' chemistry with each other all worked out very well, though Arnold is the obvious standout and draw.  Action and FX: Top notch for the most part. There was one scene with a Hunter-Killer (future helicopter things you see in all Terminator films) that was very obviously CGI. The Young Terminator CGI was seamless. The entire Terminator series is well-known for its practical (real-world, non-CGI) effects, and T5 delivers on that as well as any of the movies in the franchise. Some of the critics mentioned there were no memorable set pieces in the film. After watching T5, I have to wonder whether those critics watched the same movie I did. There were several memorable set pieces, environments that were essentially a 'character' within the film. This was true of T1 and T2, obviously: the Tech Noir night club (Sarah's first encounter with the two time travelers), the CyberDyne building and the steel mill in T2, and many I won't list here. But T5 had set pieces that were just as memorable. People gasped several times at how the action played out in these environments.  Humor: I think this movie had a little less humor than T2, though more than T1. There weren't really any hugely stand-out lines (besides the ones we've all come to expect), though ""I've been waiting for you"" is very satisfying to hear, and ""Old, not obsolete"" line was implemented well. Much of the comedy comes from Arnold's T-800 portrayal as he struggles to seem more human, which was, of course, the well the humor in T2 pulled on so successfully.  3D: I watched it in 3D, and I and those that went with me enjoyed it as well. I was glad to have experienced my first 3D Terminator film, that it was done well.  Dialogue/script: Not perfect, but nowhere near as campy as T3. T5 takes itself seriously, unlike T3. I've already mentioned T1 and T2 are better than T5, and I think that's largely because they were exactly what James Cameron intended them to be (he has had *no direct involvement* with Terminator films since T2). I've already mentioned the twists were great, the storyline was great. They leave a couple things hanging, hoping this movie is a success and there will be two more. I'd honestly be happy with it ending here. Things were wrapped up very nicely besides some minor cliffhangers, sort of the way T2 ends on a dark road and an unknown future. But I'd certainly give the sequels a chance if they come about.  Verdict: I won't give this a numerical 'set-in-stone' score just yet. I need to rewatch this film to decide exactly how it stacks up to T1 and T2. It was a fun thrill ride with some really interesting plot points that really furthered the Terminator narrative in a way that T3 and T4 never came close to achieving. For reference, I would give T1 a 9.5 (mostly due to limitations in technology in 1984), T2 a 10, T3 a 6, and Salvation a 5. If I had to take a guess on this one without a repeat viewing, I'd give it between an 8.5 and a 9. It was better than I expected after the weak critical reviews. It surprised me, it made me smile, laugh, sit on the edge of my seat, root for the heroes while trying to understand the opposition. The film paid great homage to the first two without leaving the audience feeling like T1 and T2 weren't important due to the changes made in the timelines of T5.  If there's a sequel... well, I'll be back. Though, the future is not set. No fate but what we make.",0,0,Dustewart,jNU_jrPxs-0,0.2142697835497836,2015-07-05 08:52:44,False,True
2015-07-05T08:53:30,"A spoiler-free review (at least, no more spoilery than the trailers). (1 of 2) Intro: Let me first just give you my absolute first reaction to this movie as it began. When it started and the music kicked in, I was instantly there, just instantly back in the world of Terminator. Connor opening monologue in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, lacking the original theme music, didn't do that for me. Terminator Salvation's altered opening music and the movie starting with Marcus didn't do that for me. It's a beautiful beginning to the movie, set to the iconic music made famous in T1 and T2, instantly invoking the feelings of watching the two greatest movies in the franchise.   Terminator 2 (T2) and The Terminator have been two of my favorite movies since I was a child. T2 is my favorite movie of all time, and I have seen it dozens of times, more than any other movie. I have some built-in biases for this franchise, but mostly only with T1 and T2 (as T3 was lackluster and T4 a completely unnecessary entry). So I'm either a good person to listen to about this, or a bad one, depending on how much you trust this huge fan's opinion on movies. Looking at how long this review is should tell you how serious I am about T1 and T2. smile emoticon   So the big draw for me, besides this being a Terminator film (that was endorsed with heavy praise from the creator of the franchise, writer, director of T1 and T2-- James Cameron) is that Terminator Genisys is a new take on those two films, those two timelines within the series. It ignores T3 and T4 as if they never happened, and rightfully so. Cameron said that, to him, this felt like the real T3. The movie's biggest mistake was revealing its biggest plot twist in the trailers.   Now, the movie has gotten some pretty bad critic reviews and some pretty good audience reviews. This happens when an action movie is a good action movie but doesn't meet certain criteria for a ""good action movie"" according to critics. One main complaint from them was that they thought it was confusing. Time travel is inherently confusing, but I was able to understand the movie completely, seamlessly. I will admit that I need to watch it another 2-3 times to figure out whether or not everything works out logically across these varied timelines, but that's what repeat views are for. And I will be rewatching this several times (little hint of my actual review).  Another complaint critics had was that they took time to explain (""and re-explain"") what's going on. So... the movie is too confusing but they needed to explain less? I thought the exposition was completely smooth, did not drag the action down, and was entirely interesting. Lastly, some critics said that Emilia Clarke was miscast or that she struggles to fill the shoes of Sarah Connor. No one will top Linda Hamilton as Sarah, but Clark did very well. As did the other characters, Reese and John Connor. And need I say it, Arnold Schwarzenegger was absolutely in his element in this movie. Great performance (one positive aspect critics agree with).",0,0,Dustewart,jNU_jrPxs-0,0.1405535331671695,2015-07-05 08:53:30,False,True

First 20 or 30 mins I was suprisingly impressed with how it was going and the added time complexities were promising but I think the whole John conner half terminator thing was dissapointing . I felt at times , that schwarzeneggers terminator was a bit ...mmm..too human or seemingly emotional at times . Becoming slowly more like a DROID in star wars than a terminator . I get its a learning machine , I get this one has spent far more time in human society than any previously known terminator and it was funny but ....Certainally I truly feel it would have worked much more effectively had the real twist been in the story , that pops was the true infiltration unit and killed Sarah or kyle at the films end , that would of been more of a surprise this time round . Kyle is of course paranoid about him initially and warns that he may have directives pops himself is unaware of (think order 66 in star wars ) . Who sent pops back remains a mystery . He doesn't even know as his memory of that is wiped , though Sarah reasons as to why . Skynet seems to know far more what's going to happen it advance than before and I think the ultimate check mate in this kind of story , would of been to suddenly reveal the true assassin as the trusted pops . With Skynet having greater foresight of the timeline than all the human characters and of course even the terminators it sends back , each failure ends up being neccasary to make a certain point , or event happen that triggers pops unknown , classified primary directive but so quick and sudden that it's not anticipated in the slightest (and of course no corny one liners )",0,0,Kelly Eeles,jNU_jrPxs-0,0.1792102206736353,2016-02-10 01:27:11,False,False
