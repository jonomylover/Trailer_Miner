The main characters figure all this out and try to fix things for the ghost by ""freeing"" her spirit or whatever... They think is all over, but they're wrong... The ghost is still pissed off and makes a final appearance (probably as a jump scare) to give us a hook for a possible sequel.

Making it so the woman/creature moves and lunges and attacks removes a lot of the actual creeping fear (the best kind) - which I think is what made the original short so good - and puts it back into the jumpscare category - which is second only to gorefest for lazy terror tropes, imo.  I have nothing but respect for this guy for having been able to make it so far in the business, but I really don't think the idea was all the conducive to a full-fledged movie.

The scene where the woman is flicking the lights on and off tells us that the creature cannot exist in light. It stand to reason that if the creature was doing disappearing act voluntarily, to avoid being in light, then it would have crazy reflexes and no need to chase the characters. It would be over in an instant. So maybe when lit the creature is not visible and is intangible. It can still move, just cannot interact. There are other explanations as well, but I favor this one. So what happens if you put a strong flash light on half of it's body?

Simply because the demon or what ever isn't scary, and secondly your little ""jump scare"" was so fucking obvious and see through and bogus that even you decided that adding a little noise would raise the quality to make it more ""scary"". Shitty is what I'd call this if all you do is add a jump scare with loud fucking noises in the background to fucking terrify us. You know what I think is scary? Phobias, getting a person to emotionally attach themselves in movie to get themselves edgy and when shit rolls they shit themselves without a bogus jump scare. Jump scares shouldn't be the horror, the story should be the horror. The plot, not the immediate climax. Think about it like this, you are having sex you are all pumped up and your lover is just beating you off to get you ready. But you cum, and now that you've cum you don't wanna fuck anymore. But you have to just to make him/her happy and involved. This plot seems a bit overrated and kinda childish. ""OH IT'S SCARY COZ SHE'S AN EVIL SPIRIT OUT ON A HELL BENT REVENGE""! I've seen that shit from many other movies. No more, make something worth our money and so we are motivated to see another movie you produce. I liked Green Inferno, it was a gory thriller. I loved Saw, and Hostile. Halloween, Freddy, Jason, etc. I love classic zombie movies like 28 weeks later, and Quarantine. Some freaky shit, but they aren't full of fucking JUMP SCARES!

The movies became more gory as they went on because the studio thought that was what sold tickets, when in reality, there was very little gore shown in the first movie. It was more about what your brain would conjure up when given the situations the people were in, like the barbed wire trap and the oil and candle trap. They showed very little gore.  Also, James Wan didn't direct this, he produced it while he was directing The Conjuring 2. The guy who did the short, David Sandberg, directed this, which is why I have high hopes for it being good.

2016-09-10T04:37:38,the originality  of lights out is questionable. I happen 2 know an old underrated film with lots of similarites with lights out. darkness falls (Jonathan liebesman. 01/24/03)    Both deal with a young child fearing a vengeful female spirit that is affected by the light and an older protagonist that has already dealt with the ghost in the past and come back to aid said child.  Both the older protagonists have also lost a parent to the creature as a child themselves. in fact i couldn't help noticing how the main characters in lights out try to get away from Diana by avoiding being in the lighty areas exactly like what the main characters in darkness falls did to the tooth fairy matilda. did the writers copy these ideas ? lord knows ! but nonetheless i saw lights out it was a very good horror that will never b forgotten.,1,3,Ronald Wilmington,6LiKKFZyhRU,0.13217948717948716,2016-09-10 04:37:38,False,True

She also has a keen talent of stealth as well as invulnerability to most physical basic weapons, knives, guns, swords etc. Most of these would not be able to hurt her as her attacker wouldn't be ever able to get close. He/she would have to stay in the light to keep her at a distance which makes it easy to keep her opponent in the defensive.
