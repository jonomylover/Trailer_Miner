Mercedes started racing again in '52 following the war and was very successful with their 300SL which won Le Mans that year. In fact, in '55 I want to say they were winning Le Mans when disaster struck and they went on to finish the season while also winning the Manufacturers Championship for the season.     I'm not trying to take anything from Ford. They built an amazing machine but one does wonder if they would've ventured into racing at all if Mercedes were still in the mix dominating Ferrari. It almost seems Ferrari lost it's competition and was trying to find a new challenge when poking Ford. Just my 2 cents and doesn't change a bit of anything about the history that occurred.

2019-09-19T03:25:56,"Bill Ford & Tata~ A true Story  This goes way back to the year 1998, when Tata Motors launched their first car Tata Indica they wanted to enter the passenger car market with this one.   But unfortunately it proved to be a flop. People advised Ratan Tata to sell their passenger car company and he agreed to do that, he proposed Ford to buy their passenger company and Ford also showed interest in their proposal. Ratan Tata along with his team went to Detroit where the headquarters of the Ford was situated. The meeting went well, Bill Ford the chairman of Ford said to Ratan Tata,‚ÄùWhy did you enter the passenger car business when you were not knowing of it. It will be a favor if we buy this business from you.‚Äù. Ratan Tata returned to India in a tense mood.  After early struggle, Tata Motors became a big name in India by 2008. But it was not a good time for Ford as they were on the edge of being bankrupt, Ratan Tata gave them an offer of selling their luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover. The deal was done and Ford sold their luxury car branding(s) to Ratan Tata for 2.3 billion $. The Bill Ford said,‚ÄùYou are doing a big favor for us by buying Jaguar-Land Rover.‚Äù",337,20,Dibya J Baruah,I3h9Z89U9ZA,-0.0537037037037037,2019-09-19 03:25:56,True,True

These 4 guys are putting Frankenmuth on the map!!  In fact, they named the band after a lifelong resident of Frankenmuth!    These guys are bringing Rock & Roll back to the radio!  Good to see young people playing Rock, with some serious 'Classic Rock' overtones in their music too.    Look'em up on YouTube if you never heard of them before...I doubt you'll be disappointed?  But, I'm sure you'll hear a lot more from these young guys, in the very near future!  They are touring in Paris, Belgium, Germany, Italy right now.

In the spring of 1963, Ford learned through a European intermediary that Enzo Ferrari, who is facing financial difficulties, might be interested in selling his business. But Enzo Ferrari withdraws from the negotiations at the last moment and abruptly cancels the proposed sale.  Vexed, Henry Ford II decided to create a car that could compete with Ferrari.

2019-11-15T14:30:04,"Not from today, Americans are very good at telling their movie tales.  Hollywood has always shown an understandable tendency to manipulate true stories, obviously in the legitimate attempt to make them more spectacular.  Moreover, it is a classic: in the cinema, as in the Far West, between legend and reality, in short, the legend must win ...   I am not surprised, then, by the poetic licenses, let's call them that, that punctuate ""Le Mans66 - The great challenge"", the film that reconstructs, much to stars and stripes, the famous rivalry between Enzo Ferrari and Henry Ford, two giants of a  Twentieth century that also fell in love with the car thanks to them.  Mind you: I am not a film critic, the film lets itself be looked at willingly and the magnetic power of stars like Matt Damon and Chris Bale is indisputable.   Only that.  Except that it's a bit big to say that the Maranello Drake (admirably played by Remo Girone, a fantastic actor, was the unforgettable Tano Cariddi of Television Piovra) went in person to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in 1966, to see the  his cars beat Mr. Ford's, only to be disappointed by the negative result.   It's simply not true.  It never happened.  At that time Ferrari had long since stopped going to racing.  But in Hollywood it was better to imagine the opposite ...   It is true, instead, to go to the American reconstruction, that in Detroit they were fiercely irritated with Enzo the Modena for his refusal to sell the Ferrari to Ford in 1963. The negotiation had by now arrived in port but in the great Italian the patriotic spirit prevailed.  In a sense not comparable to the modern political language, the Maranello Drake considered himself a sovereignist.  Giving the fruit of a life, his own, to the stranger, however powerful and important, here, he clashed against the instinct of man.  So the company was held, guaranteeing it a future tricolor through the agreement with Gianni Agnelli.   That ""no"" sparked the fury of Ford, who also deeply admired the Davide from Maranello.  The Goliath used all its resources to take revenge on the track and in fact at Le Mans, in 1966, the giant had its satisfaction.  Even here, however, the story deserves to be told until the end.   The duel did not end with the striking battle of the 24 Hours held in the land of France.  Less than a year later, in 1967, in Daytona, Florida, Enzo Ferrari definitively closed the game, winning the greatest triumph with ‚Äúcovered wheel‚Äù cars.  In America, at the home of Henry Ford, three Cavallino cars, the first driven by Lorenzo Bandini and Chris Amon, signed a spectacular hat-trick.  First Ferrari, second Ferrari, third Ferrari: that was the headline of the newspapers.  I very much doubt that they will do a movie on this in Hollywood.

The close up shots shots of drivers going 200 mph side by side and then pressing the gas pedal down further. Worse yet, downshifting are 200 MPH?  Total crap. 4). In one scene Shelby tosses a lug nut into the Ferrari out area during the race causing the Ferrari out crew to go crazy thinking they just have sent out a car without one of the lug nuts.  Uh, excuse me but the cars didn‚Äôt even use lug nuts.  The wheels were tightened with spinners on the hubs which was clearly shown in another scene.  Do you think we are idiots?

However, anyone who has seen the movie will profess to the fact that they are both highly misleading; however, they're not irrelevant either - the film starts with a business deal gone wrong between the two automotive giants on either side of the Atlantic, and it rolled on to that controversial Le Mans finish in 1966. But at its heart, this cinematic treat is about Shelby and Miles, and that.... was beautiful to watch.  Racing Cars, at that time, were raw. Devoid of any digital electronic gimmickry, the drivers of that time had no digital assists to 'aid' them in controlling their 7.0 L engines. No ABS. No traction control. No automatic transmissions. Nada. But that's exactly what made them REAL drivers. Taming those machines required skill; it required finesse; and most of all... It required guts.  And one such driver was Ken Miles. Miles was that one driver who would ""become one"" with the machine while coaxing it to its absolute limits, and would look good doing it. He was a gifted man behind the wheel, and an astute engineer - and that's evident in the fact that he had a big hand to play in developing the legendary Ford GT40.... A car which shook the automotive world by beating Ferrari at its own game in 1966, and is revered even today. He had many achievements to his name, and came very very close to taking the Triple Crown home... But was thwarted by Ford's sneaky corporate tactics. After his tragic demise, Shelby and Ford continued to cement their names in the minds of the general public, whereas, Miles became a forgotten hero and remained in the shadows.... Till now.  This movie pays homage to his legacy, and it does it well. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are not the typical duo you would expect, but they have knocked it out of the park with this one. Their interpretation of each character's persona is a delight to watch. Mangold's direction serves to really bring out the atypical bromance between Shelby and Miles. The racing sequences are a guaranteed delight for most car fanatics. Overall, the movie does well to deliver a historical narrative, (albeit with a touch of drama) and is worth a watch on the big screen (even if you're NOT a petrol head).   Considering that Miles was not adequately acknowledged, nor recognised in his time for his efforts and contributions, and the fact that he was cheated of the biggest win of his life, it is safe to say that this movie takes it upon itself to offer some vindication and respite on that sentiment. People deserve to know about Ken Miles and celebrate the man that he was.   (And yes, Mr. Miles, we know in our hearts, that you won the Triple Crown. It's about time we raised our glasses to you.)  Go watch the movie. You won't be disappointed.",56,3,Praneet Chitre,I3h9Z89U9ZA,0.14432319618366127,2019-11-21 19:42:47,False,True

How about footage of the real events, and then blending in the movie scenes where it's re-created?

Better yet, it's based on a true story, although the movie takes some liberties to up the dramatic aspects of the story.

The visuals and race scenes are outstanding, and the reason the race scenes feel and look so real is because they are, it's not CGI and you can tell. While I'd wish less artistic liberty was taken with the story, the essential aspects of the story are accurate.
