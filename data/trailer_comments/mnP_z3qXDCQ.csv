2018-07-28T20:29:11,"Nothing speaks to the masses like a good bit of propagandized entertainment.  Its as a tactic that is as old as politics itself.  The Ancient Greeks and Romans would propagandize plays to exalt their leaders and emperors or commemorate a great victory.  In fact, the Romans were exceptionally prolific when it came to producing propagandized entertainment that played out everywhere throughout the Empire from traveling minstrels to the reenactment of great Roman victories in the Coliseum.    European Kings and Queens throughout history likewise used propagandized entertainment to help bolster their popularity among their subjects, especially the peasantry.     In modern times, propagandized entertainment played an integral role in the allied war effort by portraying the Nazis and the Japanese as bloodthirsty monsters.  Even the Nazis used propagandized entertainment by portraying the Jews as greedy, dirty, villainous subhumans bent on the destruction of the Fatherland.    During the Cold War, the US production of anti Soviet and anti Communist propaganda in the entertainment industry was unrivaled by any other country.  Tom Clancy, for instance, wrote some of his most popular novels when the Cold War was raging in the 1980's.  Even after the end of the Cold War in early 1990's, Clancy changed the theme of his novels from US vs Soviet Union to US and Good Guy Russians battling the remnants of the evil Communist Soviets in the mid to late 90's.  After 2001, the theme of his novels changed to battling terrorists.   Politics in entertainment has been etched into the fabric of American pop culture since the days of Francis Scott Key and his tune, the Star Spangled Banner.  It only seems as though Hollywood has recently become a political propaganda machine because we are only now just waking up to it.",0,0,Chris V,mnP_z3qXDCQ,0.021388888888888867,2018-07-28 20:29:11,True,True

2018-11-20T20:12:14,"I teach screenwriting - writing story for film. If your comments involve issues with the script, that's one thing. But many comments here are political, anti-American comments, which is idiotic. Hollywood studios do not produce films that won't make money. If there's an audience for action/thriller movies with good acting, then the film will get produced. Leave politics out of enjoying an action/thriller movie. Have an enjoyable day with this genre of film. You can always go see a cartoon or a comedy or a romance or a sci-fi if that suits you. You can see anything you want as a matter of fact. Films with a political agenda that are preachy are never successful. If you hate to see America winning, you can always go see an Indie-film where a dystopian universe prevails, everyone is starving, America is defeated, terror reigns, and there are no more children around. That has also been done. It's called The Hunger Games. Very successful. Many copycats have been less successful. The reason? People like originality, unique telling of age-old stories. Boy meets girl has been around for thousands of years. But boy meets girl on a sinking ship that was a ""true story"" made hundreds of millions of dollars - even though it was basically boy meets girl. So, enjoy yourself at the genre film of choice.

Rear Admiral John Fisk sends a Virginia-class submarine, the USS Arkansas, under the command of newly-promoted and unorthodox Commander Joe Glass to investigate. At the same time, a Navy SEAL team under the command of Lieutenant Bill Beaman is sent in to discreetly observe a Russian naval base, but their mission is swiftly complicated when Martinelli, the team's new DM recruit, is rendered unconscious during the HALO drop. When they arrive at the naval base, they witness defense minister Dmitri Durov conducting a coup d'eta and taking Russian President Zakarin prisoner, and swiftly realize that Durov intends to trigger a war.
