This movie trailer is just a taste of how great this movie is going to be. I have been going to the live concerts since 1968. I saw Jersey Boys on Broadway for the first time November 5, 2006. This was the last preview night. I had the pleasure of talking to Bob and Frankie that night. I said, ""This show is going to be a smash hit!"" Eight years later, I'll paraphrase what I said, ""This movie is going to be a smash hit!"" What a sweet feeling for all of the Seasons' fans who  took a lot of ridicule when the music scene changed so many times over the last 50 years.
