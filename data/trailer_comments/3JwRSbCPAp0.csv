2018-02-25T17:14:47,"This movie seems to talk right at me. Me losing my father with no resolutions to our struggle to reconnect makes this movie so dear to me. I can relate to this song and movie so much. I remember the first time I heard the song myself after a supervisor told me about it many yrs ago, I was driving to Alabama from Paducah KY after completing a project at the gaseous diffusion faculty there. When the song came on i turned it up and omg it hit me so hard and related so much to it I broke down in tears and had to pull over and just cry. Lesson I get from this song is about God and to know God works. Sadly my dad and I never reconciled our differences and he passed away. The guilt is so powerful still to this day that it does effect my life but also makes me want to be the father that maybe my father couldn't be or didn't know how to be. I still loved my dad and always will but I too can only imagine. God bless dad and I know we'll work this out once we see each other again. Thanks for all that reads this. I often thought about writing a book but never had the backing. This movie will tell my story and I believe also of others who have been through the same.

2018-07-02T03:51:33,"Speaking of supporting acting roles, Dennis Quaid should get an Oscar nod for best supporting actor in this movie (I hope you are watching Hollywood). By the time you get to the moment where Bart and his father are trying to reconcile their relationship, it's basically the most deeply, emotionally charged scene you will see in a movie. They don't make enough movies like this anymore. If you've not seen this movie, buy or rent it today. Trust your instincts by the trailer, it's that plus a LOT more...It's a movie full of emotion and life lessons about forgiveness and love we can all learn from, an absolute gem.",1,0,Rory M.,3JwRSbCPAp0,0.30500000000000005,2018-07-02 03:51:33,False,False
