2015-08-22T21:09:16,It was hilarious taking my daughters to see this movie showing them the era when Rap was really Rap before Lil Wayne and Drake ruined it. But funny how this movie still divides races but when I went it was all Asians and Whites at the Theatre. That didn't bother me but what bothered me was that they were there not having a clue on who this group is except for Ice Cube from Friday and Dr Dre that made Beats By Dre is what they said. They did not know any of the songs let alone have a clue of what went on in this time era. This Movie had a bigger message I don't think anyone is understanding. I guess I'm getting old but it felt good hearing these song I used to have on tape not an IPad. Some of you may not even know what a tape is but this movie was great.

It is hard for me to make sense on any given level. Myself is fabricated, an aberration. I am a noncontingent human being. My personality is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent. My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago (probably at Harvard) if they ever did exist. There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it, I have now surpassed. I still, though, hold on to one single bleak truth: no one is safe, nothing is redeemed. Yet I am blameless. Each model of human behavior must be assumed to have some validity. Is evil something you are? Or is it something you do? My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this‚Äîand I have countless times, in just about every act I‚Äôve committed‚Äîand coming face-to-face with these truths, there is no catharsis. I gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding can be extracted from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this.
