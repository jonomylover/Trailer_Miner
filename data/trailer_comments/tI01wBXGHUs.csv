2016-11-03T22:49:12,"I've always been more advanced than kids my age, and I can say that limiting a child's potential is cruelty. I remember I always hated doing what other kids were doing because I already knew it and I wasn't allowed to learn different or advanced things. It's not true what they say about a gifted child not having a normal life. My mom had me skip a grade and I adjusted just fine. Although I could've skipped more, the state didn't allow it because they thought that a child should be with their age group and that it would make the other kids feel like they were ""dumber"". But looking back, I honestly wish I could've done different things and been enabled to pursue my potential. Gifted children should be nourished, not told that what they know should be kept hidden. I disagree with the plot of this movie because it's honestly so insane. Why can't she use her ""giftedness""? Why must she be so limited? To live a ""normal"" childhood? And what exactly are the benefits of a normal childhood? What does it even mean to have a normal childhood? Isn't it better for her to expand her already implemented knowledge and achieve what few kids can do at her age? I remember my childhood being great, and I was homeschool most of my elementary years. I was glad that my mom helped my mind open to the infinity of wonders this world has to offer. If a child can see all of that, why not help them? Many would argue that they shouldn't be pushed and that it's cruel to ""subdue"" them to the things that adults are learning, but from what I can tell, she (the little girl) enjoys being pushed. Many gifted kids are often bored and slack off because they find that there is no point in doing the same thing that other students are doing. I remember I was extremely bored and finished in a few minutes what other kids spent two, three, or four days trying to figure out. Honestly, what is wrong in enhancing the potential of a gifted child? They can either lead a bland, normal life that countless of other children have gone through or be introduced to a world that is so intriguing and complicated that it's nearly unimaginable that a child can understand it. That's the way I see it.",0,0,Laura Usai,tI01wBXGHUs,0.06049593681172628,2016-11-03 22:49:12,True,True

Being gifted is SO much more than being good with numbers...it is an ENTIRE way a child views EVERYTHING in the world.    Painting gifted schools as a closed-minded 'think-tanks ' that will 'rob' a child of a fulfilling life is a sack of horseshit.  Being surrounded by other children as gifted and as curious about EVERYTHING in the world will complete a gifted child, and provide them with desperately wanted stimulus and reward.  As the father of a young gifted child I live this amazing, frustrating and constantly evolving reality every day...Movies like this place a priority of an emotional response over what is truly right for the child; Chris Evans' character should move to where the school for her daughter is located and give her that stimulus as well as the love she needs from her father.

To get to the point, not many people or the average persons in life are civil, patient or cordial. This movie shows a lot of patients which under normal life situation would not happen because it is difficult to control if you factor in once emotions. Control is an illusion.

2017-05-27T14:00:44,So this frustrates me.  I had a son who was easily doing algebra and reading at an 8th grade level by the time he was 4. He somehow figured it all out on his own - easily flying through an on line math course at his own choosing. I had a very difficult time educating him because his teachers couldn't keep up and some called his advanced learning ability a problem for the rest of the class.  We bounced from school to school - private schools turned him away because they could.  I got him a math tutor at Dartmouth when he was 7 - he was in high school at 9 - thanks to the principal who had her PHD in profoundly gifted education - he was the captain of the high school Latin team at 11 (and he loved it and they him)  - but still was a kid - still had a childhood - still had friends his own age. Finished with college at 18 (although it would have been sooner if I let him finish high school at 14) ... Why do people think that just because a kid is a fast learner.... and gets to keep up with what he wants to learn - that robs him of his childhood.
