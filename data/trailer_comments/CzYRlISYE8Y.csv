2020-03-21T23:06:02,"A real travesty this underperformed in the box office, everything from directing to acting was top notch. This film was full of style, and the comedy was the best too, nothing like those stupid quip jokes in recent movies. A totally underated film. It might be the name and (lack of)marketing that stopped people from finding this gem.  I really hope this becomes a cult classic big enough that it might actually see some sequels, hopefully before Henry and Army are too old. Same goes for The Nice Guys, another film in the same position.",1,0,Raw Bird,CzYRlISYE8Y,0.13627450980392158,2020-03-21 23:06:02,False,False
