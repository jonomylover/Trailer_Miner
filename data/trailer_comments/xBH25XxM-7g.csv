But it turned out to be one of my favourite movies and I was stupid to judge it by the trailer! And ""I just saw the whole movie in the trailer,"" I swear there is one of those idiots on every trailer! What'd this trailer show that was the whole movie? The main characters, the plot and why they are there, destruction, and tornados. Well fuck me, that's the whole movie there, isn't it?

It was 2.6 miles wide and it had wind speeds of over 296 mph. It was wider than Manhatten and central park in new york. However,  there was a tornado on June 16, 1928  that was reported to be 7 miles wide in blair, oklahoma.  This movie takes place in oklahoma. Oklahoma has big tornadoes. Huge!!  This movie is very well written.  People are going about their regular schedules and have to change their plans just like I had to do in real life. Five tornadoes went through okc following the el reno tornado on may 31, 2013. The highest wind speed ever recorded on earth was located 23 miles from el reno. It was in bridge creek, Oklahoma.
