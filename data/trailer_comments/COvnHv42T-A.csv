So since Mystique doesn't become the vicious mutant, X Men, X2, X3, The Wolverine, DoFP (Post Apocalyptic Future) do not happen in the movie universe. The future is being rewritten so to speak. Time was altered¬†so nothing that happened in the movies after First Class¬†will ever take place. Its so confusing but to me it was such a creative way to sort of remake the whole X Men universe, instead of just saying OK lets start from scratch, well they did but in an awesome way. So the young cast in Apocalypse: Jean (Sophie Tuner), Cyclops (Ty Sheridan), Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Professor X (James McAvoy), grow old to become the X Men we see at the very end of Days of Future Past: Jean (Famke Janssen), Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Berry), Beast (Kelsey Grammer), Professor (Patrick Stewart), so since we saw them in the future its safe to assume that they wont, or shouldn't anyway,¬†be killed off in Apocalypse or future sequels up to that point, .New timeline: First Class, Days of Future Past, Apocalypse, future sequels with new storylines,¬†future at the end of DoFP.¬†So excited!!!",0,0,Juan Garcia,COvnHv42T-A,0.07068536931818181,2015-12-11 17:18:40,True,True

Some people still have a problem with it, but I can accept the Egyptian style Apocalypse. For those of you wondering why Apoc has the British type accent instead of an Egyptian one, we must keep in mind that the character has never had an Egyptian accent, throughout the history of his spoken dialogue. This includes the cartoon series, Marvel Vs. Capcom/ X-Men Vs. Street Fighter and X Men Legends 2: Age Of Apocalypse. Voice is still a bit too angelic for me, but I can deal with it. My real problem with the film is the overwhelming amount of dialogue. While dialogue can add a bit to the story, I'm still wondering if there will still be good old fight scenes.

2015-12-11T23:15:47,"Apocalypse is rather lackluster in presence here. The trailer here is trying to create the image of a living god, but it was carried out so much better in both X-Men animated series. I mean, at least get his voice right! It'll likely be an entertaining film, but I can't say that I'm eager to see it knowing this Apocalypse has likely been nerfed to where the X-Men will likely defeat him by a typical movie trope of ""if we work together we can beat him!"".  No. Apocalypse can wipe the floor with the entire X-Men team. There's a reason the Infinity Wars is split into two parts, and why it took the power of an infinity stone to beat Ronan the Accuser, and why X-Men should go to Disney - they respect the source material, even if it makes certain characters nearly immortal.  Seeing how other comic book films are doing so well, X-Men exists in a very weird universe where Wolverine can defeat the Phoenix and travel through time, and Magneto can lift an entire stadium with relative ease, but Apocalypse is somehow terrifyingly powerful. It makes as much sense as power levels in DBZ, and it all comes from a lack of respect for the source material.",0,0,Kenny J,COvnHv42T-A,0.04345238095238095,2015-12-11 23:15:47,True,True

I'm not saying that all CGI characters who have been made in the last years are bad.

2015-12-12T14:54:07,"To everyone who keeps asking about Wolverine:        Keep in mind that Hugh Jackman has been playing that role for 15 years now. Wolverine is supposed to age very slowly, but Hugh isn't looking like a young man any more. This movie takes place in the ""early years"" of the X-Men; however, they can't just cast a young actor as a ""kid Wolverine"" like they can for the rest of the characters because, again, he's supposed to have already been a grown adult for several decades (the whole healing factor thing keeping him from aging).  So, really, it's going to get hard for them to keep putting him in if he isn't playing ""old man Logan."" Unless everyone chooses to ignore the original trilogy that started in 2000 and re-cast, or they start doing some CGI youth-restoration to his face.  Hugh Jackman has already said he's only doing one more Wolverine movie, then he's done with the character (because he's just getting too old for it).",0,0,Suda,COvnHv42T-A,0.11288888888888889,2015-12-12 14:54:07,True,True

The jOY [at least for the 30 to 40 year MARVEL fans] is seeing the comic book pages we grew up with come to life.  In the 80's MARVEL fans could only dream cause DC was taken by a corporate movie studio with millions to spare in movie making.  Those classic movies can be seen as crude--campy and even silly.  BUT it's just a comic book story.   Plots--Storylines--Themes are always going to be simple and even regurgitated.  Comics were always for kids.  How deep can you go. And in today's world many followers are more adult than child.  BUT that's okay.  The inner child in all of us just wants a good vs. evil adventure story that we enjoy and connect too. Since 2000 til now the mighty Marvel Cash machine many of you speak of, has ruled the Hollywood movie scene.  Like tons of styles--fads--media things that ""are in the NOW"" let's at least appreciate  [and this is just me being a faithful and ever happy Marvel fan since a boyhood in the late 70's] that 15 years is a good run to be hot and still be relevant enough to wake-up the other sleeping Giant DC.

2015-12-12T16:59:17,"As a big fan of X-men, I will watch this movie. However, I am upset with some decisions they have made which I feel changes the original story too much. First of all, where the hell is Cable? How can there be a story about Apocalypse and not Cable? He is the one who really alerted the X-men to Apocalypse and the dark future. He traveled back in time over this! On a side note, Cable is a freaking badass. Secondly, Apocalypse's Four Horsemen in this movie are frustrating to me. They made Magneto, Storm, and Psylocke horsemen which is not at all what happened. Although I think Psylocke was a horseman at one time. Out of those characters, it is unacceptable that Magneto becomes a horseman and serves as a puppet. He should be stronger than that. They already nerfed his character's powers. He can't do several other things in the movies besides move metal. Thirdly, I agree with other commenters that Mystique is getting way too much importance just because she is played by Jennifer Lawrence. I was already bothered by that in Days of the Future Past, and now this is getting out of hand. Also, what has happened to Wolverine? Although it will be a nice change that other characters have screen time instead of Wolverine stealing the show.",0,0,Apollo XI,COvnHv42T-A,0.024999999999999998,2015-12-12 16:59:17,True,True

Black Widow and Hawk Eye are completely useless to any of the other characters. Black Widow, can do anything the other Avengers can also do, Hawk Eye is just a guy with an incredibly unrealistic bow. The OLD Marvel was great! The comics were amazing! Now its only for the money, and it already turned into Transformers. Transformers was something made into movies, so older people than us, could see their favorite comic and TV show, into a movie. Its no different from any type of Marvel movie. If someone is going to make any kinda of movie these days, they need to take a good long look at history, and think: Is this really going to con-inside with the past forms of entertainment?

His four horsemen terrorize the mutant world, and talk about their boss making a NWO. Our heroes chase these 4 around, Magneto becomes one, but will be redeemed..

Apocalypse, the first and most powerful mutant from Marvel‚Äôs X-Men universe, amassed the powers of many other mutants, becoming immortal and invincible. Upon awakening after thousands of years, he is disillusioned with the world as he finds it and recruits a team of powerful mutants, including a disheartened Magneto (Michael Fassbender), to cleanse mankind and create a new world order, over which he will reign. As the fate of the Earth hangs in the balance,the meaning of this whole trailer is saying that we are worshiping an praying to the wrong god an we have been mislead by mankind today an that egypt africa is the roots.we all know its just comics but this is powerful trust me.an in the video at 1:56 he said an from the ashes of there world you will see fire an some books getting burned it looks like bibble from all types of religion",1,0,lil mike,COvnHv42T-A,0.1338083213083213,2015-12-12 18:03:53,True,True

I'm am not saying that the two are not significant. Hughe Jackman is an amazing actor, and Wolverine is a badass, but it is called X-men, not X-Man. The first three movies were centered so much around one character that the movies suffered for it. Perfect example, in the comics the Phoenix Saga till this day is one of or if not the most expanded upon arcs. But instead of trying to formulate a story that would bring justice to Jean Grey and her complex Character and pretty amazing powers and her relationship with the Phoenix Force, they made her bipolar, and had her killed by mental knifes. A cosmic God which took a Galatic starship to shoot an energy beam at her to kill the Phoenix was killed with three claws. Fox then ook it upon themselves to sell out the comics and make spin offs for Wolverine. Until recently with the back stories from First class and futures past to the new Apocalypse were starting to see the real raw X-men and how they were formed BEFORE Wolverine every became one of them. The only person I feel can never be replaced is Patrick Stewart that bald head was made to be Professor X, anything else is warranted for change and hope they show more accuracy in the depths of each character and their powers.",0,0,Enrique Archbold,COvnHv42T-A,0.13272651261781696,2015-12-12 22:52:51,True,True

There are three years and six months of the antichrist's reign then, he will sit in the third temple in Jerusalem and demand worship. At this time, God will unleash his wrath on those that worshiped the antichrist for the other three years and six months. Only at the end of the tribulation does God return to establish his kingdom for the faithful.   Secondly, The antagonist of the film is claiming to be god.

The kids with powers are nephilim hybrids, or offspring of alien / demons (one and the same). And the apocalyptic scenario played out in this movie is obviously foreshadowing for the upcoming apocalypse. Apocalypse means the lifting of the veil, or insight. Apocalypse does not mean the end, it is only an insight that we will see we have been deceived from the beginning. No im not religious, these are just facts that you will soon see to be true. Go ahead, laugh, scorn, and shill this post trolls, for you will see the stupidity and how extensively you've been brainwashed. Yes, in this lifetime. Try November of 2016. Mark my words! Laugh it off like a closeminded degenerate swine, see if I care.. you certainly will not have the last laugh, sheep of youtube / paid shills.  Jesus said ""I am the truth and the way and the light"". I am not here to preach Jesus, for christianity took what he said too literally (also follows a hugely revised ""sacred"" book meant to imprison people in biblical law) When Jesus said I am the way, he really meant I AM. Literally he was his own way and light... YOU ARE YOUR OWN SAVIOR. Nobody is perfect.. but just try your best to love unconditionally! That's it. Love yourself, and love everyone else.. even when theyre spiritually blind morons who cling to their material world... love them anyways! Which is why I wont be responding to any replies, I love you anyways! Have a great day. Love love love. The end is neigh. Well not the end, just a change... to some itll be their end.. but it is merely an ongoing spiritual warefare that will soon be brought to the humans attention. Just a war nothing more, and they will loose. So I guess no matter what you believe you really dont have anything to worry about hah! But do your soul a favor and just try to love unconditionally. Much love everyone! -- For those of you who watch this movie in theaters I encourage you to look for the ridiculous amount of foreshadowing and symbolism that'll be crammed in that movie.",1,0,Dali Poko,COvnHv42T-A,0.22558578197165155,2015-12-14 02:10:27,True,True

The movie buffs got to watch the trailer on Friday in which a blue coloured villain, played by Oscar Isaac, says, ‚ÄúI have been called many things over many lifetimes ‚Äì Ra, Krishna, Yahweh.‚Äù  Rajan Zed, the Hindu Stateman observed the mention and released a statement which says, ‚ÄúSuch trivialisation of Lord Krishna, who is highly revered in Hinduism, is quite inappropriate and disturbing to the devotees‚Äù.  It states further, ‚ÄúLord Krishna was meant to be worshiped in temples or home shrines, not for pushing movies for the mercantile greed of filmmakers. The inappropriate usage of Hindu deities or concepts for commercial or other agenda is not okay. This is another example of the poor use of Hinduism culture in Hollywood.

And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.  And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them:and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.  If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity:he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.  And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.  For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.  Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.  Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.  Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.  The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.  Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.  Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Lord, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. - Psalms 74:10-18, MASHIL OF ASAPH.  Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.

They need to FOCUS on properly building the way to Infinity War. What do you prefer; an amazing cinematic universe filled with heroes with an ""alternate"" universe filled with mutants OR a bunch of characters frantically jammed together?  2. Wolverine is not the center of the X-Men. To those who aren't good in English; MEN is PLURAL. If you did not read the X-Men comics, the mutants shown in the video are the ORIGINAL members. Beast, Jean Grey, Cyclops, Angel, Jubilee (the asian chick who is WOLVERINE'S COUSIN), Storm, Nightcrawler, etc. They are ALL important. They just weren't given the proper screen time in previous films.  3. This movie is the mini""civil war"" version of X-Men. Whoever becomes the four horsemen will undoubtedly kick ass.  4. To the religious people of ANY religion complaining about Apocalypse claiming who he says he is; THIS IS JUST FICTION. If you cannot handle that; then do not watch.

If you have faith, you will know that this movie will not make God any lower or make him look evil to other people, whether they believe in God or not...   This is for entertainment, and I believe that movie makers knows that creating a villain that ancient people see as God would sound awesome to the fans... I don't know whether they deliberately add that line to promote something against God... I would like to think that's not the case...   Because movies, right from the beginning, only have one major purpose, for entertainment (and also for making money, that is), not for insulting religion, creating wars in the comments, or making people hate  movies...   So, to those who have faith in the gods mentioned in the trailer, do not feel offended, because they (the movie makers) have no intention of offending or insulting your beliefs (I hope that is the case), just stay strong in your faith....  And to those who do not believe in the gods mentioned in the trailer, if you see people with beliefs commenting about how Fox shouldn't have made those sort of statements regarding beliefs and religion or them being mad about it, understand that they are merely fighting for something they believe in, they are not looking for a fight...

2015-12-22T22:35:01,"So there is a lot of back and forth in the comments about the use of the name of God being applied to Apocalypse. There are those believers (both Hindu and Christian) who are offended and those who do not believe who are offended that the believers are offended. I usually try to stay on topic, but this is an important point, especially in the age we live in today.   For those that do not believe and do not understand the offense taken by those that do, let me put it in non-religious terms. I'm old school. Where I am from, if you do not know someone, you keep their name out of your mouth. If you don't know me, you have no reason to talk about me to others. If you don't know my family, you have no reason to be talking about my family. Stay in your lane and talk about the things in your sphere. To talk about something that does not pertain to you is foolish and a folly.   Same goes for people's religion or beliefs. It's cool that you don't have the same belief. but respect others and keep those names out of your mouth. If you are not Hindu, Christian, Islamic, etc, why do you need to speak the names of their gods.   Respect. But most in this generation don't get that. They run off at the mouth about any and everything because they are nicely hidden away online and don't have to worry about consequences of offending someone. That's cool, but it can't last.

What makes more sense is that the first mutant was someone with powers not extremely different from that of a normal human (e.g. like a Level 1 mutant), and then gradually, evolution began to produce more higher level mutants like Jean Gray, etc., people so different from humans that they might as well be a new species.",0,0,gail margolis,COvnHv42T-A,0.052789256198347116,2015-12-25 12:20:46,True,True

I mean, she looks more like Katniss Everdeen in a blonde wig than Mystique.

The true Hebrew Israelites  (descendents of black slaves,Hispanics and native indians) of the bible are God's chosen people and they have been following false leaders (Obama for example) and even worshiping false idols (white image of Jesus that was made after Cesare Borgia). Hollywood is conditioning people with movies like this so that even when the day comes and Yeshua brings judgement people will deny him till their dying breath and see him as an enemy.

I have no complaints about the trailer or anything about the story or the cast/characters. I wonder a few things though: 1. Will the Phoenix be hinted at?

That's my best guess as to why they made that film and how it's supposed to make any sense. They have taken my favorite characters from my childhood for 16 yeRs and destroyed them. While this may be a great film as a standalone or beginning with Xmen first class, don't try to watch the first three films or the wolverine films and think it somehow has anything to do with this film. Though I am excited to finally see apocalypse. People want the MCU to eventually tie into the X-Men. This can't happen for several reasons. One of which being that Marvel doesn't even own their own characters, the other being that FOX went to great lengths to destroy the X-Men. If one didn't know better, one might think this was deliberate. They have forever ruined the idea of the X-Men. Try thinking of wolverine and you think of High Jackman....for example.

How much more generic can that get? I mean really? Its so generic its like they though oh lets just throw that quickly together its not a big deal. I noticed that with a lot of movies lately. The logos to their movies are always plain black, grey and silver metal colors. Anyway the other thing that kinda bothers me. Apocolypes himself. MUCH better redesign compared to the first one... however... his voice... From what i can remember in the comics he had a movie robotic type voice. I havent followed X-men in years. Last comic books ive red were the 6 part Legion Quest and straight after that The Age of Apocolypes for me those two comic series were really the best they produced. I cant comment on the new stuff though. I just feel his voice should be a bit more robotic unless this version is at a more human state before becoming more sentient?

The apocalypse storyline in the comics and 90's animated series was always one of my favorite parts of the X-men saga. Not to mention the return of some of the cooler characters left out of the reboot so far, like young Nightcrawler, and a young Jean, Scott and so on. If you consider X-men worthless without Wolverine as the main character or because it is ""anti-religious"" just because it references religion, please GTFO and go watch something more your style. I hope also that Singer gets to direct more superhero franchises other than X-men, maybe he'd even do the marvel trilogy I've most wanted but is not likely, a Maximum Carnage trilogy after the (hopefully final) reboot of Spider-man this time.",8,1,heathenbreathinfire,COvnHv42T-A,0.151984126984127,2016-02-04 11:54:10,True,True

As a San Francisco Chronicle movie critic said, X-men is more of a ""thinking person's [superhero] movie."" And the jokes are actually funny, and they weren't trying to make them funny. Avengers tries to hard to be funny and it comes off very awkward and cringe-worthy. I get a headache from rolling my eyes while watching avengers. I can't stand Black Widow, Thor, Iron Man, hulk, and the completely butchered Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver. Captain America is the only superhero they did right, and they made the movie all about the avengers.

They who created the New International Version are  guilty of calling the Holy Ghost a liar.  Satanic verses  are not His.  As Jesus said, not one jot or tittle shall  disappear from the Law until all has been accomplished.   And here again, seek and ye shall find.  Others may  seek, but they will not find.  For it is not given unto  them to find.  I have said, KJV.  But have not told you  which edition.  People who speak not English, will they  learn Latin, Hebrew, or Greek?  The Father, the Word,  and the Holy Ghost are one.  And Jesus Christ is the  Word made flesh.  He who has His Words, and does  the will of God is a Son of God.  They who promote  slavery, theft, abuse others, are of the devil.  Victims  are full of anger, and victimizers - if they are repentant,  feel guilt.  Self defense is not murder.  They who desire  not to make their conversation holy, and encourage  others to bd profane, are victimizers.  They who invade  another's privacy are victimizers.  The sodomites, they  teach the boys contact sports, as a consensual  activity.  But how many boys are aware that they are  being taught to accept touching other males?  It is  not a coincidence that many sodomites watch contact  sports such as mixed martial arts.  In the movie, Top  Gun, the boys play a non-contact sport called  volleyball.  Slider poses, his body unmarred by scars  or bruises.  Pain is a negative.  You allow pain to touch  you when you strive for something good, a better  physique, better health, or to save life - as firefighters  do.   Top Gun is very underrated.  Auditing is wrong -  like the_rapy, or confession booths, or giving testimonies,  wrong.  Only angels - made ministering spirits are  permitted to audit, check under the hood, make fixes,  etc.  But how will they if a person refuses to believe  that Jesus Christ is Lord?  For the way Jesus described  himself - He is Jacob's Ladder.  And the angels ascend  and descend upon Him.
