2016-11-05T03:48:51,There's one big reason why I'm excited for this film more than any other for the rest of the year. And that reason is Whiplash. Whiplash was the best film of 2014 and I think no other film since has topped it. Whiplash was both directed and written by Damien Chazelle... and so is La La Land. That's why I'm hyped for this.  Chazelle is a talent to watch for... (Especially if the film has something to do with Jazz),55,6,AWSOMEPOSSUM16,0pdqf4P9MB8,0.25892857142857145,2016-11-05 03:48:51,True,True

2016-12-13T17:01:40,"La la Land is just amazing. It cured my insomnia and sent me to la la land literally within minutes. But why?  1. Plot. Nobody watches a musical movie for its plot. But it is unforgivable to conjure up a clear oscar bait with a plot skimpier than Kim K's g-string and as formulaic and unimaginative as Trump's combover.  2. Music. You can forgive the plot but can you forgive the music since it's a musical movie? None of the tunes is memorable and the score is inferior to even that of Nocturnal Animals' (music is not even its key selling point).  3. The singing. Where do you even begin? We know that both leads are not known for their singing or musical talents but Ryan Gosling's singing can only be described as Kermit warbling in pain when Miss Piggy is not available for the night. At best.  4. The casting. Gosling clearly looks very uncomfortable throughout the movie and within 20 mins you get a clear sense that he's not even committed or even bothered and he just wishes this nightmare to be over. And Stone? With her resting bitch face (RBF) she would be effective in roles such as the scene-stealing one in Birdman. But as a delusional, campy, act-cute, wide-eyed girl next door with a RBF? Give me a break!!  5. Lack of chemistry between the co-stars. Let's just say that there's more sexual chemistry if you put Trump and Hillary in the same room. On the same token, it's also more believable for Obama to hump Kim Jong Un than for the leads to get it on.  6. Dialogue. The script seems to be written by a pre-school kid with mild retardation or a drooling Kanye upon receiving a full mental exorcism la A Clockwork Orange.  7. Pacing. I snored. The lady to my left snored. The Uncle behind me snored. Within 20 minutes.  8. Mandatory conflict scene. It's as intense as a spoilt child having an existential crisis over the fact that he was fed more yellow peas than green peas.  9. Ending. Unique and clever and surprising? Nope. Just lazy and manipulative and pretentious plagiarised hogwash.",0,0,Leisure maximalist,0pdqf4P9MB8,0.14932432432432433,2016-12-13 17:01:40,False,True

The songs were dazzling and boy, hearing these songs that you can't get out of your head.

2017-01-10T19:25:48,"I have said there can be a film with an unoriginal story, but can be made enjoyable with a fresh approach. I don't feel La La Land did that.   The tunes were unmemerable. If I do think of the score/songs, I'm trying to actually remember them than already humming it. However, City of Stars was quite good. Perhaps a bit over-used, and the first introduction on the pier felt odd and out-of-place. Like, where did it come from suddenly in this film after the previous scene(s)? Same can be said for all other songs, which really are not many at all.   It's a nice romantic drama film to watch and nice to see both actors together and as their characters. They are quite loveable and cute together. However it was another unoriginal story of struggling actress and musician meet and fall in love and follow dreams together, either ending up successful together or alone. Luckily, their chemistry and warm scenes together make it watchable and not overly distracting.  Maybe the point of the film relates to it's own characters. Trying to be a revolutionist instead of traditionalist. Maybe ""La La Land"" is trying to be revolutionary and fresh instead of a traditional musical by simply being a romantic drama featuring musical numbers - doing something new than straight-forward and a checklist. But even then, with a part satire and realism of the Los Angeles world, including traffic and constant sun and warmth (that film funnily needed to show time pacing by listing the seasons) it still doesn't come across as anything groundbreaking.",0,0,Rowan Charlton,0pdqf4P9MB8,0.1878551136363636,2017-01-10 19:25:48,False,True

We see this when they go out for the date night, their house isn't as good as it was with her real husband. Mias overall dream was to make it big. Sebastian's dream was to also make it big, but mainly he wanted Mia happy. He knew that if he went to Paris with her, she would not have gotten her dream so he made a sacrifice and let her go. At then end when they smile at each other, she realizes what he did through his song. In the beginning of the movie he said that jazz told stories and conflict. They also both said they would always love each other, and they still do. Mia realized at the end what Sebastian has done for her to get her where she is today and then they let go.

Then mentioned to my manager she felt uncomfortable when im around her after the only thing i did for her to maker sure she was happy because she complains about everything so i did try to make her her job easier because i love when she is happy and smiles because everything goes the way she  wants. Because of she mentioned to someone to the person that was  jealous i was stepping ahead of him effortlessly he told the main corp what she said then i lost my position as a manager and they cut me my hours almost got fire still she was the one mad at me when she was the one who woke my feelings without the intention of loving me . All the management stuff moved her to the morning time and me to the night time and i only see her one day but i don't get close to her lately she started to talking  to me again the one day we work ! i just want to remember the day she offered me to take me home after i lost my brand new car in a crazy accident  and how we used to spend hours talking about everything and how she  smiled at me and  don't want to go even if her girlfriend was calling her she wouldn't pick up  her girlfriend's call and cried to me then let me held  her hand  and me saying sorry  and she saying it is ok and smile at me and telling me how she felt lonely here in California that she misses her family  !!!

2017-01-25T18:40:11,"La la Land is just amazing. It cured my insomnia and sent me to la la land literally within minutes. But why?  1. Plot. Nobody watches a musical movie for its plot. But it is unforgivable to conjure up a clear oscar bait with a plot skimpier than Kim K's g-string and as formulaic and unimaginative as Trump's combover.  2. Music. You can forgive the plot but can you forgive the music since it's a musical movie? None of the tunes is memorable and the score is inferior to even that produced by an amateur funeral band.  3. The singing. Where do you even begin? We know that both leads are not known for their singing or musical talents but Ryan Gosling's singing can only be described as Kermit warbling in pain when Miss Piggy is not available for the night. At best.  4. The casting. Gosling clearly looks very uncomfortable throughout the movie and within 20 mins you get a clear sense that he's not even committed or even bothered and he just wishes this nightmare to be over. And Stone? With her resting bitch face (RBF) she would be effective in roles such as the scene-stealing one in Birdman. But as a delusional, campy, act-cute, wide-eyed girl next door with a RBF? Give me a break!! You know something is seriously wrong when John Legend with limited scenes is your best actor.  5. Lack of chemistry between the co-stars. Let's just say that there's more sexual chemistry if you put Trump and Hillary in the same room. On the same token, it's also more believable for Obama to hump Kim Jong Un than for the leads to get it on.  6. Dialogue. The script seems to be written by a pre-school kid with mild retardation or a drooling Kanye upon receiving a full mental exorcism la A Clockwork Orange.  7. Pacing. I snored. The lady to my left snored. The uncle behind me snored. Within 20 minutes. Doesn't help that most scenes are almost akin to that created by a Z grade producer of a third world tourism promotional teaser.  8. Mandatory conflict scene. It's as intense as a spoilt child having an existential crisis over the fact that he was fed more yellow peas than green peas.  9. Magical mysticism scene. Ordinarily it would look funny, playful or creative. Here it just looks juvenile, awkward and clumsy.  10. Ending. Unique and clever and surprising? Nope. Just lazy, manipulative, pretentious and plagiarised hogwash.",0,0,Leisure maximalist,0pdqf4P9MB8,0.12354227405247815,2017-01-25 18:40:11,False,True

2017-01-30T09:52:42,"I saw the movie today. And I think it was interesting. On one end it paid tribute to the MGM musicals with some of the director shots and that captivating ending (Through the fury camera shots I instantly thought of that 18 minute fantasy break in ""American In Paris"". But their neat trick is that they used REAL LIFE MOMENTS. Excellent.) I appreciated that aspect of it, as well as the plot, which detailed a unique covenant exchange.  The only negative I have is, while I loved the chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, I wished for more from them in terms of song and dance. If you work with them 3-6 months longer than they might have, you have dance routines akin to Rogers and Astaire. (I felt the choreography was not tight enough) But that's me 1) wanting perfection or 2) actually ""holding on to tradition as opposed to moving into the future."" - get it?

2017-02-23T08:14:34,"Praise   A subconscious and unspoken stigma and stereotype exists among movie producers and most people that a film is for children if it is all about bright colors, simple messages of happiness and verbally expressed joy through song and beautiful art as well as principles of familiar real life things that most good people hold as ideals such as young love or honor in various jobs. Somehow La La Land proves this utterly wrong and rips those biases utterly to shreds. It reminds us all that color and life and goodness is what we are looking to see in real entertainment, which is a childlike feature in all of us, the innocence we long for. It‚Äôs balance between serious themes and dreamy heart make it irresistibly attractive and intriguing. It proved that old fashioned values combined with art in simple and pleasant forms, as applied to art, are every bit as meaningful and held as respectful to a huge adult audience by the 340 million it‚Äôs already made. Obviously, it was made after the way of an older and ‚Äúbygone era‚Äù of films that were classier, more innocent, more simple, more musical, and more jolly. But I believe it made a masterpiece of itself accidentally, perhaps because the more youthful producers fill in their absence of true experience with a bygone genre (the 1920s, 30s, 40s, and 50s) with their imaginations, that give their forbears the benefit of the doubt in the way of true quality and meaning, but, who cares? It worked! This film was a masterpiece among films in my opinion. It proved to me something I have long believed to the center, which is that part of the glory of being human is to embrace innocence, and the purer elements of art such as mastery of pictures, singing, presentations, and dance with honed practice by experienced and passionate artists‚Ä¶of a kind. La La Land proved to be more than paying homage or milking nostalgia to some supposedly greater and forgotten era, but a solid and deliciously indestructible piece of living proof that new and original pieces of entertainment not only can be made but can make today‚Äôs world brighter and more beautiful by remaining optimistic, original, and true to form in the process! This movie is gold! It could hold the potential for some kind of modern renaissance of worthwhile art in many forms. It didn‚Äôt make me long for the past, it didn‚Äôt break my heart, but it didn‚Äôt let me away easy either, it didn‚Äôt leave me critical, it didn‚Äôt leave me without a smile on my face, it didn‚Äôt leave me content, but it didn‚Äôt leave me unsatisfied, it gave me just that right balance of entertainment to not only pleasantly distract me away from the woes of real life but want to get back to it and make something more of it, and that is meaning! It left me wanting more true art in other forms, and if a movie can pull at my inner humanity like that, it‚Äôs masterful enough to be called an original masterpiece, if there ever was one. Like other great movies like Star Wars, somehow it just hit the spot with the perfect balance of just the right things; drama, color, comedy, originality, simplicity, easiness of understanding, heart, a touch of fantasy, a touch of realism, plenty of romance, seriousness, a little sadness, small aspects of uniqueness, and not overdone in any of those qualities. For this reason it should stand the test of time. What a wonderful film. I standards have been raised.

Sure, I can list some plot holes that don't make sense in the narrative, but with every movie comes problems.  While I think this movie is better than Moonlight, I am happy Moonlight won instead of this.  The movie already had its success and doesn't need anymore awards or money.  It made more than enough with 300 million worldwide, a bunch of nominations, and wins from other awards during its run.  It doesn't need the best picture win more than Moonlight does.

That scene where they were dancing against the purple background was way too long and boring.    I know why actors in Hollywood would like a movie about this because as actors, they can relate to it.  But I don't know why it made so much money.

LA LA Land is a fun movie. I'm sure moonlight is probably good and I will likely watch it next. I currently just want something fun. Every movie doesn't have to expose me to some struggle or show me it can be ""darker"" than the last rendition(Lego Batman even made fun of that trend).  Here is what I took from the movie: If you have a lot of experience with old movies, this one will get your memory going as you'll swear you've seen this scene before.  LA LA land hocks from a lot of old movies. Fred Astair, Danny Kay, Bing Crosby,Debbie Reynolds, Rosemary Clooney, etc. There are a lot of little subtle nods. The main actors even dressed in a similar style.   Don't see it like it will be nonstop singing(Avita, Les Miserables ,Sweeny Todd), nor like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.  Maybe a little closer to Singing in the Rain, for song and dance. I wouldn't have minded just a little more dance.

They talk, dress and act like they're in the 50s, and all the rooms are designed like the 50s.

And no cinema today would play it. I know some cinemas sometimes play classics, but Rebel Without A Cause isn't a classic, because most people today haven't even heard of it.

Damien Chazelle chose that ending because he didn't want your usual ""happily ever after"" clich√©. He wanted to do something more original. ""Paper Towns"" by John Green is another example of this kind of ending.   But in a story, no part of it (especially the ending/climax) should be chosen for what it is NOT.

They do this deliberately to sell the movie to the target audience... averagely attractive females with high standards in men as they are really shallow at the core. The psychology behind this is to make you feel you could get a gosling if you looked a bit better.

Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling‚Äôs phenomenal acting performances really made us think and look deeper into Mia and Sebastian‚Äôs characters, and really put us in their shoes. The movie to me, was as sweet as apple pie, and warm as molten chocolate lava fudge. Especially the ending.  The ending was not what a lot of people expected, but if they were to look at the lessons that it teaches, isn‚Äôt that the whole point of the ending? The point of life?¬†You encounter something so amazing that you‚Äôd want it for the rest of your life, but you also have to give up another amazing thing to get the new one. You meet someone that instantly lights up your world, and you‚Äôd want and need them in your life, but you can‚Äôt, because your heart tells you that you have to pursue your career that you so longed worked for and respected. You end up facing some difficult choices. Life is like that, and it‚Äôs not always gonna be fair. It‚Äôs not always happy-ever-after. There are paths in life that will force you to make a decision, and sometimes you‚Äôll doubt if you made the right decision. But that‚Äôs life. Not everything will always be your way. The important thing is as long as you listen to your heart. Cherish the experience you have: show love and respect to all those around you, and make meaningful memories with the ones you love. Maybe sometimes, it‚Äôll work, maybe sometimes it won‚Äôt. Be patient and persevere; when one door closes, another one opens, and you just have to make your own choices in life. And maybe one day, you‚Äôll look back and cherish the memories you have made, the paths you have taken, and the lessons you learned through your experiences. Life isn‚Äôt fair, and it‚Äôs not supposed to be; and not everything is a happy-ever-after. But it‚Äôs all part of the experience, and one day you will look back at these days, at all this pain, and you will cherish it forever. It‚Äôs the decisions that we make today that count and shape our lives, and whether or not we also listened to our heart. Life isn‚Äôt fair, and you won‚Äôt always get the happy ending; but as long as you listen to your heart, and cherish and love those around you, who knows what miracle could drop by your house. You will one day look back, and cherish all the memorable memories you have made in your experiences.",53,1,Blair Comptons,0pdqf4P9MB8,0.29309327036599764,2018-01-30 13:56:00,False,False

2018-10-14T10:45:36,"My intepreation of the film: before Mia and Sebastian met each other, they had their own dreams, which they were chasing. Mia thought her biggest dream was to become an actress and Sebastian thought his biggest dream was to save jazz by opening his own jazz club. but then they met each other and fell in love. It was then where they realized, that the actual dream had always been a quite different one: to find true love. And they did find it in each other. Notice also when ""city of stars "" was played the first time in the movie, it was right after Sebastian had told mia about his ""dream"" in the jazz club. But when he sang the line ""is this the start of something wonderful, or one more dream, that i cannot make true"" .. he was actually singing about the dream to find the true love with mia (he kind of felt, she was the right one just by then), but he was afraid to not being able to make this dream come true, because by that time, Mia was still together with this other Guy Greg. Also when ""City of stars"" is played in full lenght later, the lyrics lead to this idea as well. In the last scene of La La Land, when they both have the ""flashback"" of how things should have been going, they both realized, they had given up the real dream: true love. And instead they had followed their other dreams, which is also good, but still the ""true dream"" had always been a different one...",4,0,Richard Roy,0pdqf4P9MB8,0.2572478991596638,2018-10-14 10:45:36,False,False

I  even found the overture to the movie (which is very beautiful, I might add). However, there is something very odd about this trailer. At 1:47 the three roommates are dancing next to a garden. That's not in the movie, and don't tell me it's in the song ""Someone in the Crowd"", because I have seen and studied this film enough to realize that it is not. My guess is that part of the song was cut from the film after the trailer was released, but before the movie came out.

This movie is grounded and way better than any other Bollywood romantic film. This film didn't get recognition world wide but it was a hit in Maharashtra in India. In India Bollywood has been ruining love and romance. Bollywood should learn something from the regional movies. Now Bollywood is just remaking  movies and ruining the old songs by just adding DJ are rap in it. The entire industry is not like that ,there are some good director, producer and actors in Bollywood who are constantly working hard to present a good Cinema to their audience. I hope the Indian audience should also change and the audiences are constantly changing with time also, now viewer are appreciating some of the great actors like Manoj bajpai, nawazzudin , Irfan Khan and many those who were much underrated.",0,0,shrutik patil,0pdqf4P9MB8,0.19754901960784313,2020-03-29 21:12:56,False,False
