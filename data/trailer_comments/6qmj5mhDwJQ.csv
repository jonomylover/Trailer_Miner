The Canaanites’ sin was so repellent that God said, “The land vomited out its inhabitants” (Leviticus 18:25). The judgment was not ethnically motivated. Individual Canaanites could still find that mercy follows repentance (Joshua 2). God's desire is that the wicked turn from their sin rather than die (Ezekiel 18:31-32, 33:11).It must be remembered that God gave the Canaanite people more than sufficient time to repent of their evil ways—over 400 years (Genesis 15:13-16)! The book of Hebrews tells us that the Canaanites were ""disobedient,"" a word that implies moral culpability on their part (Hebrews 11:31). The Canaanites were aware of God's power (Joshua 2:10-11, 9:9) and could have sought repentance. Except in rare instances, they continued their rebellion against God until the bitter end, and the reason why God destroyed the children was because Without the protection and support of their parents, the infants and small children were likely to face death anyway due to starvation, and if God would've let the children live they would've ended up just like their parents and been condemned to hell after they died.

2013-11-16T04:59:55,"I absolutely cannot wait to see this film! I've been waiting for a trailer for at least two years when I first learned about this project. Although it doesn't say it in the Bible, science has confirmed that the sky prior to the Biblical Flood was actually pink and magenta. This is also provable given the enlarged botanical proportions in the fossil record and that plant life does grow 30% more lush under those color spectrums. When the flood rains finally ended, the ""windows of heaven"" or the atmosphere was depleted to the many levels we have now as opposed to the one pre-Flood atmosphere. With this, the 'global flood-waters ocean' reflecting upward gave the sky its bluish hue we see today. Also, because there was no rain before the flood, there were certainly not any clouds. The earth's surface was watered from mist; and of course there were rivers and seas. Concerning the date for the Biblical Flood, Eugene W. Faulstich calculated known Biblical dates with the aid of astronomical computer programs to conclude that Creation began in 4001 B.C. Also, when the Biblical Flood is about to commence, the Book of Genesis gives this date: ""In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month,..."" Faulstich's results found that the Creation week was from March 19 - 25. If this is correct with the best star chart calculations available today, then the Flood began on May 17th ""in the year of the world"" 1656. The Flood began 1,656 years after Creation. Give or take a few months to a year or so, A.D. 2013 is actually the chronological year of 6013 or 6014. If you think about it, it makes total sense for the Flood to begin in Spring and also for Creation to begin the very week we consider the end of Winter and beginning of Springtime. In conclusion - not taking Gregorian leap-year days into account - as of November 17, A.D. 2013, the Biblical Flood began 4,357 years and six months ago!!",0,0,Elijah Luthor,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.15026785714285712,2013-11-16 04:59:55,True,True

You guys remind me of this group of atheists complaining because they didn't have a holiday of their own. They thought it was unfair, in our pluralistic culture, that Christians had holidays like Christmas and Easter, and they didnt have any. Atheists do have a holiday; they just haven't realized it yet. April 1st is their natural holiday and could be declared a national atheist day. Why April fools day? Because the Bible clearly says, ""The fool says in his own heart 'There is no God."" I think it takes a great deal more faith to believe there is no God than it takes to believe there is one. Why? Because to sustain the belief there is no God, atheism has to demonstrate infinite knowledge which is tantament to saying ""I have infinite knowledge that there is no being in existence with infinite knowledge.

In fact i'm just as logical as they are and see where your coming from, look there is no evidence of that it had actually happened or not who knows, but what everyone needs to realize is that the bible is a book of knowledge, in fact a majority of it is not true, but it has deep meanings. That's why we have people dedicating their life's to understanding all of its hidden mysteries. It was never meant to be taken literally word for word. That's the problem with people nowadays, they only believe what they can see. Refusing to have any faith in anything. Faith is believing in something you cant see or know. No one can prove that Christianity is wrong and Christians will never have the tools to prove they are correct, the only tool we have is faith. And faith is something hard to find in this current world.  P.s. For those who say that science and religion don't mix, what a load of crap. I'm sorry, but you all come up with sad explanations. Science is there to explain but never actually ""prove"" anything through evidence, but everything is a theory.

So they are without excuse. 21 For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. 24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, 25 because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. 26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. 28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. 29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.",1,0,CoachYanke88,6qmj5mhDwJQ,-0.025153793574846192,2013-11-17 13:47:29,True,True

He said, ""O my people, indeed I am to you a clear warner, [Saying], 'Worship Allah , fear Him and obey me. Allah will forgive you of your sins and delay you for a specified term. Indeed, the time [set by] Allah, when it comes, will not be delayed, if you only knew. ""He said"", My Lord, indeed I invited my people [to truth] night and day. But my invitation increased them not except in flight. And indeed, every time I invited them that You may forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears, covered themselves with their garments, persisted, and were arrogant with [great] arrogance. Then I invited them publicly. Then I announced to them and [also] confided to them secretly. And said, 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers. What is [the matter] with you that you do not attribute to Allah [due] grandeur. While He has created you in stages? Do you not consider how Allah has created seven heavens in layers And made the moon therein a [reflected] light and made the sun a burning lamp? And Allah has caused you to grow from the earth a [progressive] growth. Then He will return you into it and extract you [another] extraction. And Allah has made for you the earth an expanse That you may follow therein roads of passage. ""Noah said"", My Lord, indeed they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children will not increase him except in loss. And they conspired an immense conspiracy. And said, 'Never leave your gods and never leave Wadd or Suwa' or Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr. And already they have misled many. And, [my Lord], do not increase the wrongdoers except in error."" Because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire, and they found not for themselves besides Allah [any] helpers. And Noah said, ""My Lord, do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers an inhabitant. Indeed, if You leave them, they will mislead Your servants and not beget except [every] wicked one and [confirmed] disbeliever. My Lord, forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house a believer and the believing men and believing women. And do not increase the wrongdoers except in destruction.""",0,0,Ghada S.

White people or as we call them today Europeans were not even on the planet untill Genesis the 25th chapter and the 25th verse.

As human beings we use words to mean certain things, but God can often give them new, more comprehensive meanings.  For instance, the word prayer originally meant making supplication to God, but Islam came and gave it new meaning – it became the ritual prayer preformed five times a day.  When we use the word family, we think of blood ties and relationships, and Noah was imploring God that his son was of his family.  God told Noah that his son was definitely not part of his family because he was unrighteous.  True family are the righteous believers in God. “He said: ‘Oh Noah!  Surely, he is not of your family; verily, his work is unrighteous, so ask not of Me that of which you have no knowledge!  I admonish you, lest you be one of the ignorants.’” (Quran 11:46) Noah understood.  He said; “O my Lord!  I seek refuge with You from asking from You that of which I have no knowledge.  And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers.” (Quran 11:47)",0,0,kaleel Rahman,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.1400481215213358,2013-11-19 19:14:13,True,True
2013-11-19T19:16:20,"I found this interesting. I'm not one to debate religion, it just causes a huge storm of emotions, and no one wins. This is the director Darren Aronofsky's views on religion, spirituality and the world.  Darren Aronofsky, director of Requiem for a Dream and Pi, as quoted here [1] : [interviewer]: You know, a lot of filmmakers seem to be either very literary-based or else very movie-based who just watch movies. You seem to really be developing this new visual style that suits each story. You know, how did you find this third road? DA: It's probably because I'm Godless. And so I've had to make my God, and my God is narrative filmmaking, which is -- ultimately what my God becomes, which is what my mantra becomes, is the theme. -- Some elaboration on Aronofsky's views, from an interview on The Fountain [2]: What’s your take on God? Are you religious? Do you believe in God? DA: I think the themes of The Fountain, about this endless cycle of energy and matter, tracing back to the Big Bang... The Big Bang happened, and all this star matter turned into stars, and stars turned into planets, and planets turned into life. We’re all just borrowing this matter and energy for a little bit, while we’re here, until it goes back into everything else, and that connects us all. The cynics out there laugh at this crap, but it’s true. [Laughs] The messed up thing is how distracted we are and disconnected from that connection, and the result of it is what we’re doing to this planet and to ourselves. We’re just completely killing each other and killing the planet, and it’s a state of emergency right now, I think. All of my charity work has always been about the environment. There are 15,000 species on the endangered species list. Mercury poisoning is my new thing. [Laughs] We’re doing it to ourselves. The fact that there’s mercury poisoning in the breast milk of indigenous people in the North Arctic is all coming from us, and Alzheimer’s is on the rise. What are we doing to ourselves? It’s a complete disconnect. To me, that’s where the spirituality is. Whatever you want to call that connection -- some people would use that term God.

A 900 year old man built a boat so large it would have been physically and literally impossible (even by todays standards), that was capable of holding two of every creature on earth, without having to separate the predators from the prey and they all got on merrily before instantly returning to killing each other the moment they set foot off the boat? Dont be so ridiculous. And in relation to the Mary and Joseph story, how could anyone have actually proven she was a virgin? These people didnt have the scientific knowledge to prove such a thing. She could have claimed she was, when she wasnt (a lie in other words). She could have been a raving slut and nobody would have been any the wiser (if she even existed). Just a logical thought on the matter.

These historic events were recorded in story form so it could be better remembered and passed along. Within a few generations what started as a mundane event transformed into a more epic and significant event. Kind of like when you play 'Telephone' where you speak a sentence into one person's ear and the message is continually passed along to more people. Gradually the sentence morphs into something completely different by the time it gets to the last person. Noah's Ark is best known for the strange events and occurrences (the flood, giant ship, and two of every animal) instead of the more normal actions.

If you study the geneology, you will learn that Lot's daughters had incestuous sex with their father, and bore children.  From these children were descendants, and these were slain in the Old Testament.  Also, I understand from what I've studied, about fallen angels mating with humans, producing beings, giants.  There is much mention of these giants being killed, and their descendants as well.    What I've noticed is that God always gives you a way out, the Pharoah in Egypt was asked repeatedly to let the people go, but he refused.  God would send a plague, and the Pharoah's false gods couldn't stop it.  The Pharoah would agree to let the people go, but then he'd change his mind.  And so it went.",0,0,Michael Ryan,6qmj5mhDwJQ,-0.12583333333333335,2013-11-20 23:47:40,True,True

The deaf/mute? The mentally ill? The sick and afflicted?   * How did a 600-year-old guy build a football-stadium-sized boat using only trees and pitch?   * What about specialized diets for the animals? Bamboo for the giant pandas? Eucalyptus for the koalas? Meat for the carnivores? Plants for the herbivores?   * Where was the food stored? How was it kept from spoiling?   * How did penguins, polar bears and other arctic animals travel thousands of miles and then survive in the middle east desert?   * How did eight people over 500 years in age shovel thousands of tons of animal waste out of a 450-foot-long ark with a single window?   * Why didn't the toxic mix of fresh rainwater and salty seawater kill all of the lake and ocean creatures?   * Why did Noah have to send a dove to find land when Noah and God were on speaking terms a few verses before?   * If the ark had no rudder, no motor and no sail, what difference did the dove make? Seeing land would have had no bearing on the drifting ark's final resting place.   * Dinosaurs?   * When the ark landed, with all animal and plant life on earth dead, what did the humans and animals eat?   * Was incest really part of God's plan for repopulation? And how did we end up with thousands of various ethnic groups in only 4,000 years?   * Why the elaborate flood? Why not just vaporize the evil humans and skip the flood? Wasn't the flood scenario hugely laborious, time-consuming and wasteful?  * Why was the one guy worth saving (Noah) ultimately found naked, drunk and in disgrace (Genesis 9)?   * Why does the Noah story so directly mirror the earlier Sumerian myth, ""The Epic of Gilgamesh,"" which also posited angry gods, a global flood, a worthy protagonist and a boat (with a single door) carrying samples of all life to be preserved?  * Why is there absolutely no geological evidence for a global flood?   * If God is truly omniscient and sees all, wouldn't he have seen the corruption of humankind before he ever created the world, avoiding the whole scenario by implementing a better plan? Or does he have a blind spot?   These are questions worth asking.""  Although yes the CG effects make it look pretty awesome.. the story itself.. is atrocious in so many ways.

These people that God removed from the face of the earth had religious rituals that included the kidnapping of children, raping and burning them alive to please their factitious gods. They even found it an honor to do the same to their own first born. So to prevent this abomination from spreading or continuing for the next 5,000 years, and saving countless millions of innocent children from untold torment, as well as saving the very souls of the hundreds of millions of those not sacrificed that would then grow up to openly engage in this atrocity themselves, God put a stop to it right then and there.  No, it would have been far worse to let mankind continue killing the innocent and degrading themselves until there would be nobody left to enter heaven at all.  Now as to why God chose to do  this with water the way he did, I don't know. We could speculate on this till the end of time.  You are welcome, and free to not like the way God chooses to do things, but there is one thing I am quite certain of, God would know and understand more about this and how to deal with it than any man on earth. ",2,12,GSpotter63,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.22102272727272732,2013-11-26 08:24:48,True,True

2013-12-01T20:30:30,"He was Noah ibn Lamik ibn Mitoshilkh ibn Enoch ibn Yard ibn Mahlabil ibn Qinan ibn Anoush ibn Seth ibn 'Adam, the Father of Mankind 'alayhis-salam.  According to the history of the People of the Book (this refers to the Jews, and Christians, so called by Allah because they received revealed Books - the Tawrah, Zabur and Injil. These names are translated Torah, Psalms, and Gospels respectively, but the Books that are extent are corrupt. Of the revealed Books, only the Qur'an remains exactly as it was revealed), the period between the birth of Noah and the death of 'Adam was 146 years. [According to Genesis 5 (new Revised Standard Version], Noah was born one hundred and twenty six years after the death of 'Adam. Ibn 'Abbas narrated that the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam said, ""The period between 'Adam and Noah was ten centuries."" [Sahih al-Bukhari] Noah was born 1056 years after 'Adam's creation (or after he left the Garden of Eden). Thus, this hadith does not contradict the previous statement from the People of the Book as it may first appear to do. The reader should keep in mind, however that any statement or narratives taken from the People of the Book are not necessarily credible. This was taken from Genesis 5.  For many generations Noah's people had been worshipping statues that they called gods. They believed that these gods would bring them good, protect them from evil and provide all their needs. They gave their idols names such as Waddan, Suwa'an, Yaghuthah, Ya'augah, and Nasran. These idols represented, respectively, manly power; mutability, beauty; brute strength, swiftness, sharp sight, insight according to the power they thought these gods possessed.  Allah the Almighty revealed:  ""They (idolaters) have said, 'You shall not leave your gods nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwa, nor Yaghuth, nor Ya'uq nor Nasr.' "" [Al-Qu'ran 71:23]  Originally these were the names of good people who had lived among them. After their deaths, statues of them were erected to keep their memories alive. After sometime, however, people began to worship these statues. Later generations did not even know why they had been erected; they only knew their parents had prayed to them. That is how idol worshipping developed. Since they had no understanding of Allah the Almighty Who would punish them for their evil deeds, they became cruel and immoral.  Ibn 'Abbas explained, ""Following upon the death of those righteous men, Satan inspired their people to erect statues in the places where they used to sit. They did this, but these statues were not worshiped until the coming generations deviated from the right way of life. Then they worshipped them as their idols.""  In his version, Ibn Jarir narrated, ""There were righteous people who lived in the period between 'Adam and Noah and who had followers who held them as models. After their death, their friends who used to emulate them said: 'If we make statues of them, it will be more pleasing to us in our worship and will remind us of them.' So they built statues of them, and after they had died and others came after them, Iblis crept into their minds saying: 'Your forefathers used to worship them, and through that worship they got rain.' So they worshipped them.""  Ibn Abi Hatim related this story, ""Waddan was a righteous man who was loved by his people. When he died, they withdrew to his grave in the land of Babylonia and were overwhelmed by sadness. When Iblis saw their sorrow caused by his death, he disguised himself in the form of a man saying: 'I have seen your sorrow because of this man's death; can I make a statue like him which could be put in your meeting place to make you remember him?' They said: 'Yes.'  So he made the statue like him. They put it in their meeting place in order to be reminded of him. When Iblis saw their interest in remembering him, he said: 'Can I build a statue of him in the home of each one of you so that he would be in everyone's house and you could remember him?'  They agreed. Their children learned about and saw what they were doing. They also learned about their remembrance of him instead of Allah. So the first to be worshipped instead of Allah was Waddan, the idol which they named thus.""  The essence of this point is that every idol from those earlier mentioned was worshipped by a certain group of people. It was mentioned that people made picture sand as the ages passed they made these pictures into statues, so that their forms could be fully recognized; afterwards they were worshipped instead of Allah.  It was narrated that 'Umm Salamah and 'Umm Habibah told Allah's Prophet Muhammad sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam about the church called Maria which they had seen in the land of Abyssinia. They described its beauty and the pictures therein. He said, ""Those are the people who build places of worship on the grave of every dead man who was righteous and then make therein those pictures. Those are the worst of creation unto Allah."" [Sahih al-Bukhari]  Worshipping anything other than Allah is a tragedy that results not only in the loss of freedom; its serious effect reaches man's mind and destroys it as well. Almighty Allah created man and his mind with its purpose set on achieving knowledge the most important of which is that Allah Alone is the Creator and all the rest are worshippers (slaves). Therefore, disbelief in Allah, or polytheism, results in the loss of freedom, the destruction of the mind, and the absence of a noble target in life. (By worshipping anything other than Allah, man becomes enslaved to Satan, who is himself a creature and becomes harnessed to his own baser qualities).  Into this environment Allah sent Noah with His message to his people. Noah was the only intellectual not caught in the whirlpool of man's destruction which was caused by polytheism.  Allah is His Mercy sent His messenger Noah to guide his people. Noah was an excellent speaker and a very patient man. He pointed out to his people the mysteries of life and the wonders of the universe. He pointed out how the night is regularly followed by the day and that the balance between these opposites were designed by Allah the Almighty for our good. The night gives coolness and rest while the day gives warmth and awakens activity. The sun encourages growth, keeping all plants and animals alive, while the moon and stars assist in the reckoning of time, direction and seasons. He pointed out that the ownership of the heavens and the earth belongs only to the Divine Creator.  Therefore, he explained to this people, there cannot have been more than one deity. He clarified to them how the devil had deceived them for so long and that the time had come for this deceit to stop. Noah spoke to them of Allah's glorification of man, how HE had created him and provided him with sustenance and the blessings of a mind. He told them that idol worshipping was a suffocating injustice to the mind. He warned them not to worship anyone but Allah and described the terrible punishment Allah would mete out if they continued in their evil ways.  The people listened to him in silence. His words were a shock to their stagnating minds as it is a shock to a person who is asleep under a wall which is about to fall and who is vigorously awakened. This person may be alarmed and may even become angry although the aim was to save him.  Noah's people were divided into two groups after his warning. His words touched the hearts of the weak, the poor, and the miserable and soothed their wounds with its mercy. As for the rich, the strong, the mighty and the rulers they looked upon the warning with cold distrust. They believed they would be better off if things stayed as they were. Therefore they started their war of words against Noah.  First they accused Noah of being only human like themselves.  ""The chiefs of the disbelivers among his people said: 'We see you but a man like ourselves.' "" [Al-Qur'an 11:27]  He, however, had never said anything other than that. He asserted that, indeed, he was only a human being; Allah had sent a human messenger because the earth was inhabited by humans. If it had been inhabited by angels Allah would have sent an angelic messenger.  The contest between the polytheists and Noah continued. the rulers had thought at first that Noah's call would soon fade on its own. When they found that his call attracted the poor, the helpless and common laborers, they started to verbally attack and taunt him, ""You are only followed by the poor, the meek and the worthless.""  Allah the Almighty told us:  ""Indeed We sent Noah to his people (he said), 'I have come to you as a plain warner that you worship none but Allah, surely, I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.' The chiefs of the disbelivers among his people said, 'We see you but a man like ourselves, nor do we see any follow you but the meanest among us and they too followed you without thinking. And we do not see in you any merit above us in fact we think you are liars.' "" [Al-Qur'an 11:25-27]  Thus the conflict between Noah and the heads of his people intensified. The disbelivers tried to bargain: ""Listen Noah, if you want us to believe in you, then dismiss your believers. They are meek and poor, while are elite and rich; no faith c an include us both."" Noah listened to the heathens of his community and realized they were being obstinate. However, he was gentle in his response. He explained to his people that he could not dismiss the believers as they were not his guests but Allah's.  Noah appealed to them:  ""O my people! I ask of you no wealth for it, my reward is from none but Allah. I am not going to drive away those who have believed. Surely, they are going to meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people that are ignorant. O my people! Who will help me against Allah, if I drove them away? Will you not then give a thought? And I do not say to you that with me are the Treasures of Allah nor that I know the unseen, nor do I say I am an angel, and I do not say of those whom your eyes look down upon that Allah will not bestow any good on them. Allah knows what is in their inner selves (regards to Belief). In that case, I should, indeed be one of the dhalimin (wrongdoers, oppressors etc)."" [Al-Qur'an 11:29-31]  Noah refuted the arguments of the disbelivers with the noble knowledge of the prophets. It is the logic of intellect that rids itself of personal pride and interests.  The rulers were tired of Noah's arguments. Allah the Exalted related their attitude:  ""They said, 'O Noah! You have disputed with us and much have you prolonged the dispute with us, now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful."" He said, 'Only Allah will bring it (the punishment) on you, if He will, and then you will escape not. And my advice will not profit you, even if I wish to give you counsel, if Allah's Will is to keep you astray. He is your Lord! And to Him you shall return.' "" [Al-Qur'an 11:32-34]  The battle continued; the arguments between the disbelivers and Noah became prolonged. When all the refutations of the disbelivers collapsed and they had no more to say, they began to be rude and insulted Allah's Prophet:  ""The leaders of his people said, 'Verily, we see you in plain error.' "" [Al-Qur'an 7:60]  Noah responded in the manner of the Prophets:  ""O my people! There is no error in me, but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the 'alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)! I convey unto you the Messages of my Lord and give sincere advice to you. And I know from Allah what you know not."" [Al-Qur'an 7:61-62]  Noah continued appealing to his people to believe in Allah hour after hour, day after day year after year. He admonished his people and called them to Allah day and night, in secret and openly. He gave them examples, explained Allah's signs and illustrated Allah's ability in the formation of His creatures. But whenever he called them to Allah, they ran away from him. Whenever he urged them to ask Allah to forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears and became too proud to listen to the truth.  Allah the Almighty related what Noah faced:  ""Verily, We sent Noah to his people saying, 'Warn your people before there comes to them a painful torment.'  ""He said, 'O my people! Verily, I am a plain Warner to you, that you should worship Allah Alone, be dutiful to Him and obey me, He (Allah) will forgive you of your sins and respite you to an appointed term. Verily, the term of Allah when it comes, cannot be delayed, if you but knew.'  ""He said: 'O my Lord! Verily, I have called my people night and day (secretly and openly to accept the doctrine of Islamic Monotheism), but all my calling added nothing but to their flight from the truth. Verily! Everytime I called unto them that You might forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears, covered themselves up with their garments, and persisted (in their refusal), and magnified themselves in pride. Then verily, I called to them openly (aloud); then verily, I proclaimed to them in public, and I have appealed to them in private, I said to them: 'Ask forgiveness from your Lord, Verily, He is Oft Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance, and give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.' '  ""What is the matter with you, that you fear not Allah (His Punishment), and you hope not for reward from Allah or you believe not in His Oneness. While He has created you in different stages."" [Al-Qur'an 23:13-14]  ""See you not how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another, and has made the moon a light therein and made the sun a lamp? And Allah has brought you forth from the dust of earth. Afterwards He will return you into it (the earth), and bring you forth (again on the Day of Resurrection) Allah has made for you the earth wide spread (an expanse) that you may go about therein broad roads.  ""Noah said, 'My Lord! They have disobeyed me, and followed one whose wealth and children give him no increase but only loss. They have plotted a mighty plot. They have said, 'You shall not leave your gods, nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwa, nor Yaghuth, nor Ya'uq nor Nasr.' Indeed they have led many astray. O Allah! Grant no increase to the dhalimin (polytheists, wrongdoers, and disbelivers etc) save error.'  ""Because of their sins they were drowned, then were made to enter the Fire and they found none to help them instead of Allah."" [Al-Qur'an 71:1-25]  Noah continued to call his people to believe in Allah for nine hundred fifty years. Allah the Almighty said:  ""Indeed We sent Noah to his people and he stayed among them a thousand years less fifty years (inviting them to believe in the Oneness of Allah (Monotheism) and discard the false gods and other deities)."" [Al-Qur'an 29:14]  It happened that every passing generation admonished the succeeding one not to believe Noah and to wage war against him. the father used to teach his child about the matter that was between himself and Noah and counsel him to reject his call when he reached adulthood. Their natural disposition rejected believing and following the truth.  Noah saw that the number of believers was not increasing, while that of the disbelivers was. He was sad for his people, but he never reached the point of despair.  There came a day when Allah revealed to Noah that no others would believe. Allah inspired him not to grieve for them at which point Noah prayed that the disbelivers be destroyed. He said:  ""My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelivers on the earth. If you leave them, they will mislead Your slaves and they will beget none but wicked disbelivers."" [Al-Qur'an 71:27]  Allah accepted Noah's prayer. The case was closed, and He passed His judgment on the disbelivers in the form of a flood. Allah the Exalted ordered His worshipper Noah to build an ark with His knowledge and instructions and with the help of angels. Almighty Allah commanded:  ""And construct the ship under Our Eyes and with Our Inspiration and address Me not on behalf of those who did wrong; they are surely to be drowned."" [Al-Qur'an 11:37]  Noah chose a place outside the city, far from the sea. He collected wood and tools and began to day and night to build the ark. The people's mockery continued, ""O Noah! Does carpentry appeal to you more than prophethood? Why are you building an ark so far from the sea? Are you going to drag it to the water or is the wind going to carry it for you?"" Noah replied, ""You will come to know who will be put to shame and suffer.""  Allah the Almighty narrated:  ""As he was constructing the ship, whenever the chiefs of his people passed by him, they made a mockery of him. He said, 'If you mock at us, so do we mock at you likewise for your mocking. And you will know who it is on whom will come a torment that will cover him with disgrace and on whom will fall a lasting torment.' "" [Al-Qur'an 11:38-39]  The ship was constructed, and Noah sat waiting Allah's command. Allah revealed to him that when water miraculously gushed forth from the oven at Noah's house, that would be the sign of the start of the flood, and the sign for Noah to act.  The terrible day arrived when the oven at Noah's house overflowed. Noah hurried to open the ark and summon the believers. He also took with him a pair, male and female, of every type of animal, bird and insect. Seeing him taking these creatures to the ark, the people laughed loudly, ""Noah must have gone out of his head! What is he going to do with the animals?""  Almighty Allah narrated:  ""So it was till then there came Our Command and the oven gushed forth (water like fountains from the earth). We said: 'Embark therein, of each kind two (male and female), and your family, except him against whom the Word has already gone forth, and those who believe.' And none believed him except a few."" [Al-Qur'an 11:40]  Noah's wife was not a believer with him so she did not join him; neither did one of Noah's sons, who was secretly a disbeliever but had pretended faith in front of Noah. Likewise most of the people were disbelivers and did not go on board.  The scholars hold different opinions on the number of those who were with Noah on the ship. Ibn 'Abbas stated that there were 80 believers while Ka'ab al-Ahbar held that there were 72 believers. Others claimed that there were 10 believers with Noah.  Water rose from the cracks in the earth; there was not a crack from which water did not rise. rain poured from the sky in quantities never seen before on earth. Water continued pouring from the sky rising from the cracks; hour after hour the level rose. The seas and waves invaded the land. The interior of the earth moved in a strange way, and the ocean floors lifted suddenly, flooding the dry land. The earth, for the first time was submerged.  Allah told the story thus:  ""He (Noah) said, 'Embark therein in the Name of Allah will be its moving course and its resting anchorage. Surely, my Lord is Oft Forgiving, most Merciful.' So it (the ship) sailed with them amidst the waves like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, who had separated himself (apart), 'O my son! Embark with us and be not with the disbelivers.' The son replied, 'I will betake myself to a mountain, it will save me from the water.' Noah said, 'This day there is no savior from the Decree of Allah except him on whom He has mercy.' And a wave came in between them so he (the son) was among the drowned.  ""It was said, 'O Earth! Swallow up your water, and O sky, withhold (your rain)!' The water was diminished (made to subside) and the Decree (of Allah) was fulfilled (the destruction of the people of Noah). And it (the ship) rested on Mount Judi, and it was said, 'Away with the people who are dhalimin (polytheists, and wrongdoing)!'  ""Noah called upon his Lord and said, 'O my Lord! Verily, my son is of my family! Certainly, Your Promise is true, and You are the Most Just of the judges.' He said, 'O Noah! Surely, he is not of your family; verily, his work is unrighteous, so ask not of Me that of which you have no knowledge! I admonish you, lest you be one of the ignorants.'  ""Noah said, 'O my Lord! I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers.'  ""It was said, 'O Noah! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people of who are with you (and on some of their offspring), but (there will be other) people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.' "" [Al-Qur'an 11:41-48]  With the issue of the divine command, calm returned to earth, the water retreated, and the dry land shone once again in the rays of the sun. The flood had cleansed the earth of the disbelivers and polytheists.  Noah released the birds, and the beats which scattered over the earth. After that the believers disembarked. Noah put his forehead to the ground in prostration. The survivors kindled a fire and sat around it. Lighting a fire had been prohibited on board so as not to ignite the ship's wood and burn it up. None of them had eaten hot food during the entire period of the floor. Following the disembarkation there was a day of fasting in thanks to Allah.  The Qur'an draws the curtain on Noah's story. We do not know how his affairs with his people continued. All we know or can ascertain is that on his deathbed he requested his son to worship Allah alone, Noah then passed away.  'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As narrated that the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam said, ""When the death of the Messenger of Allah Noah approached, he admonished his sons, 'Indeed I would give you far reaching advice, commanding you to do 2 things, and warning you against doing 2 things as well. I charge you to believe that there is no god but Allah and that if the seven heavens and the seven earths were put on one side of a scale and the words 'there is no god but Allah' were put on the other, the latter would outweigh the former. I warn you against associating partners with Allah and against pride.""

It is mankind, though, so tell the stories of us as they are and accept that it is the advancement and history of mankind. These lies are getting old, these (the greatest of all falsehoods is a distorted truth) is getting old, the idea that one race is behind the power of mankind is foolish until we honestly tell the truth, wars lost, leaders and pharaoh's, came and gone, with or without successors. The world is 4,6 Billion yrs old, the Bible dates back 5000 yrs.

He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers. What is [the matter] with you that you do not attribute to Allah [due] grandeur While He has created you in stages?

And Allah has caused you to grow from the earth a [progressive] growth. Then He will return you into it and extract you [another] extraction. And Allah has made for you the earth an expanse That you may follow therein roads of passage.'

And said, 'Never leave your gods and never leave Wadd or Suwa' or Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr. And already they have misled many. And, [my Lord], do not increase the wrongdoers except in error."" Because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire, and they found not for themselves besides Allah [any] helpers. And Noah said, ""My Lord, do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers an inhabitant. Indeed, if You leave them, they will mislead Your servants and not beget except [every] wicked one and [confirmed] disbeliever.

The world of the spirit people and the one we live in, so you may be inclined to believe the lie. The lie is this didn't really happen and there are no spirit people. The truth is what you see before you. Either way the story implies there is a war going on in the world of the spirit people. If you get involved, you may or may not survive the next intervention that is also a part of this story that hasn't been finished. If, by some miracle,anyone on this preserve survives the next intervention by the side of the spirit people who are at war with a weaker civilization of spirit people,then,and only afterward will all living creatures know the real truth. The Ark will never be found. For if it is,people will no longer rely on faith to carry on. Without faith there is no hope. Without hope there is no purpose. Without purpose there is no life.

Why does Hollywood use white actors to portray Middle Eastern men? The second is because out of the 7 biblical era lives that I lived, one of them was 'Ham' and I am currently white. This is backed up by the 'bible code', a series of messages hidden within the scriptures using equidistant letter spacing. The same code shows that Jesus was first Noah and this is why Noah had incredible abilities. That makes me the blood son of Jesus The Christ. My current sister and brother were the other two sons. I care nothing for ridicule and people will do this. I will be traveling the globe soon, bringing many things to light that must be discussed, particularly the new 'Golden Era' and 'Rapture' which I have already entered into. First, I was 'Adon' then 50,000 years later after the Annunaki hijacked the human race, 'Adam' (with Eve), then on to Ham and Abraham (Abram). Am of course is Hebrew for 'The Living God'.

Time did not make it, time only erodes. Time destroys.The human cell and the trillions of cells it is interdependent on to work the biological miracle that every human and animal are had to be created instantly for the body to function.The non believers choose to believe that over millions of years time somehow made a man . . . . . and a woman. The Man and Woman had to be there for each other from the very beginning, otherwise you wouldn't exist ! Scientists all over our planet know there was a global flood. It is visible in the rock and soil strata.However Lyell and Darwin gave us a lie to justify our indiscretions. A lie called evolution to defend our individual philosophy and beliefs. Darwin's preposterous lie is convenient for those who think we started from an explosion in space. When did an explosion ever make anything? You are a spectacular example of God's infinite creation. But time had nothing to do with that. Adam was created in seconds or even a fraction of a second, not millions of years ago, those time periods the the evolutionists speak of are fiction.Read Einstein and he will put you right in seconds regarding how we came to be and even how far man will be able to travel in space, actually not very far. But Albert knew so much, he also knew there was one God which he fervently believed in. Look at the evidence it is all around you. Borrow a microscope and take a look at how complex a molecule is. Study a DNA strand and you will see the ultra-complex design of your Creator. You do not come back again and again to live many lives and try to get your act together over repeated attempts. You get just one go at this life and you need to get it right ASAP. There is another life after this one. But like anything, you need to get it right in this life to ensure a place in the next. Noah did exist, that is why you are here. Look around you, man constantly makes mistakes and thinks he is accountable to no one. But you are accountable, you will be held accountable. Is God to be feared? You bet your life he is to be feared! He made everything because he loves us. He is as real as you or me, but, much more enduring than anyone or anything.

If you choose to deny it that is the path you choose to walk on, but be warned that when the judgment day comes you won't be able to say anything. you will just be banished from heaven, And for the second part. God saved Noah and his family because they were the only innocent people on Earth. He said that the sin grew so much that it was unbearable for Him to see so he cleansed the Earth of all sinners.

He was called a glutton and a drunkard by religious men. The SON OF GOD will never support self-righteousness, he never did then and he never will now. Jesus and religion are on total opposite spectrums. Ones the work of God and religion is a man made invention. religion says DO JESUS SAYS DONE, religion says SLAVE, JESUS SAYS SON, religion puts you in BONDAGE but JESUS SETS YOU FREE, religion makes you BLIND but JESUS SETS YOU FREE. Religion is MAN searching for GOD, Christianity is GOD SEARCHING FOR MAN. Which is why SALVATION IS FREELY MINE AND FORGIVNESS IS MY OWN, not based on my merits but Jesus' obedience alone. He took the crown of thorns and the blood dripped down his face, He took what WE ALL deserved, but that is why it is called grace, right? and while Jesus was being murdered He yelled ""Father forgive them they know not what they do"" because when He was dangling on that cross he was thinking of YOU.

Furthermore since this is not a comedy like Ice Age the whole thing plays right into the creationist agenda, at 1:30 you even see a Macrauchenia, a species extinct long before our species came to be. Which of course would lead to the earlier problem of the ark being too small since several bigger mammals of that time when Macrauchenia were still around would not even fit through the entry to the ark. Are these filmmakers that dumb? And if this weren't enough the actors are too damn pale. Are you kidding me? Apart from the fact that this story plays in what is today the Arabian peninsula, the mere fact that this family allegedly worked day and night on this big wodden ship would mean that they at least have a tan, but look at them!

How was there anything left to eat on the water-soaked earth when the ark landed? How could the animals migrate across continents (kangaroos to Australia, penguins to Antarctica, etc) without leaving a trace anywhere else? Where did all the dinosaurs disappear to (they were part of ""ALL the animals"" that went on the ark, no?)? How did a 600 year old man and his 3 sons regenerate the human race, with all its ethnic groups, in just 4000 years? Why wasn't the incestuous inbreeding unviable and terminal as we know it would be today? Where did all the cities and civilizations come from that the bible says existed within a few generations of then? If all the modern diversity (including in humans) came from just 2 parents per species 4000 years ago, is that not an assertion of EXTREME evolution over so little time?

I have a question though: (The last time I asked this question, it was taken the wrong way and people became defensive. This is NOT an attack but rather a question, as in, I'm actually looking for an actual answer...) Personally, I noticed that whenever I happen to find any article that mentions Christianity, is based on Christianity, or in any other way relates to Christianity, the comment section is always full of Atheists talking about how ridiculous/stupid/moronic/(insert insult here) Christianity is. I'm not trying to condemn anyone's freedom to do so, nor am I saying anyone's wrong, I just find it interesting that if I want to talk to an Atheist, I need to search things talking about, (or in this case, based on) Christianity. I've never read any Atheist articles (if they exist, I assume they do) so I don't know if Christians flock there as well so I'm not trying to offend or call anyone out. So my question is, do Atheist read, or watch these things in order to ""minister"" (for lack of a better word) or is there just a interest in the subject, and one simply wants to express their views, or is it merely to troll?

From the epic Babylonian story of Gilgamesh to China to South America, the Native American Indian tribes to Australian Aboriginal tribes.   The common factors of their flood story:  1 A man found favor in the eyes of his God 2 His God commanded him to build a boat because of a coming flood. 3 The flood was coming because of the evil of man. 4 This man took many animals onto his boat. 5 There were 8 members of his family that went on board. (just like the biblical account.) 6 After some time the man sent out a raven/ dove or birds to see if  the water had receded. 7 In at least 100 of these stories a sign was put into the sky (rainbow) by the mans God as a perpetual reminder of this event.",10,7,BloodOfYeshuaMessiah,6qmj5mhDwJQ,-0.05000000000000001,2013-12-26 00:42:26,True,True

I personally would like all people to get along, where everyone can continue to believe what they want to believe. The problem is atheist keep on bashing God, Christians, Jews and Muslims, etc, about the existence of God. The same people say Christian folk are bashful and judgemental, when they themselves are doing the exact same thing. Isn't that hypocritical.  Also Hypocritical is the fact that the fact that these Atheists and Scientists bash ""Faith"" (which is a strong believe), but they in all their theories about the history of the earth and universe keep using the phrase ""we believe"".

Would this be debunked if the ark was not found? if their was not evidence of holy events throughout time? God is real and we as a people look for him as long as there is a part within us that is still good. People that trash special and good things are just angry at themselves for not being taught correct principles. Man's ideas mixed with things of God are how Satan teaches the deceived from the beginning of man. Satan's plan was not meant to destroy God, it was so all mankind would be saved. Agency is so important in our lives that we could not go with Satan's plan. People forsake God. it is in our very nature. What would life be like if we had even a hint of our agency removed? look at inmates in our prison system. How do they act? Maybe a glimpse of what hell will be like? it would if they din't have cable tv and internet. what do we do when noone is looking? is charity an idea only for Christians and Jews?

A reminder to everybody flippin out over the logistics of cramming all organic life into one vessel and then repopulating the earth with eight people - the book of Genesis was originally written as a metaphor. The concept that it should be taken literally and used as a scientific tool originated very recently in Christian history. It was also written by many different people, and contradicts itself from time to time. However, I really  dislike the changes Hollywood is making in this movie. Switching one of Noah's sons for Emma Watson might be a great way to make a buck, but in later stories about Noah the gender of his children is very important.

2014-01-16T01:16:01,"This is one of the greatest stories in the Bible. Not only does the Bible tell it but most other cultures have their own account of the Great Flood. Europe: >Greek: Zeus sent a flood to destroy the men of the Bronze Age. Prometheus advised his son Deucalion to build a chest. All other men perished except for a few who escaped to high mountains. The mountains in Thessaly were parted, and all the world beyond the Isthmus and Peloponnese was overwhelmed. Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha (daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora), after floating in the chest for nine days and nights, landed on Parnassus. >Roman: Jupiter, angered at the evil ways of humanity, resolved to destroy it. He was about to set the earth to burning, but considered that that might set heaven itself afire, so he decided to flood the earth instead. >Scandinavian: Oden, Vili, and Ve fought and slew the great ice giant Ymir, and icy water from his wounds drowned most of the Rime Giants. The giant Bergelmir escaped, with his wife and children, on a boat made from a hollowed tree trunk. From them rose the race of frost ogres. Ymir's body became the world we live on. His blood became the oceans. >Celtic: Heaven and Earth were great giants, and Heaven lay upon the Earth so that their children were crowded between them, and the children and their mother were unhappy in the darkness. The boldest of the sons led his brothers in cutting up Heaven into many pieces. From his skull they made the firmament. His spilling blood caused a great flood which killed all humans except a single pair, who were saved in a ship made by a beneficent Titan. The waters settled in hollows to become the oceans. >Welsh: The lake of Llion burst, flooding all lands. Dwyfan and Dwyfach escaped in a mastless ship with pairs of every sort of living creature. They landed in Prydain (Britain) and repopulated the world. Middle East: >Sumerian: The gods had decided to destroy mankind. The god Enlil warned the priest-king Ziusudra (""Long of Life"") of the coming flood by speaking to a wall while Ziusudra listened at the side. He was instructed to build a great ship and carry beasts and birds upon it. Violent winds came, and a flood of rain covered the earth for seven days and nights. >Persian: In early times, the earth was full of malign creatures fashioned by the evil Ahriman. The angel Tistar (the star Sirius) descended three times, in the form of man, horse, and bull respectively, causing ten days and nights of rain each time. Each rain drop became as big as a bowl, and the water rose the height of a man over the whole earth. South/North America: >Norton Sound Eskimo: In the first days, the water from the sea came up and flooded all the earth except for a very high mountain in the middle. A few animals escaped to this mountain, and a few people survived in a boat, subsisting on fish. The people landed on the mountain as the water subsided and followed the retreating water to the coast. The animals also descended. >Greenlander: The world once overturned. Some people were turned into fiery spirits; all the rest drowned but one. Afterwards, the survivor smote the ground with his stick, a woman sprung out, and the two of them repopulated the world. Proof of the flood is found in the form of sea fossils on high mountains. >Cherokee (Great Lakes area; eastern Tennessee): Day after day, a dog stood at the river bank and howled piteously. Rebuked by his master, the dog said a flood was coming, and he must build and provision a boat. Furthermore, the dog said, he must throw him, the dog, into the water. For a sign that he spoke the truth, the dog showed the back of his neck, which was raw and bare with flesh and bone showing. The man followed directions, and he and his family survived; from them, the present population is descended. >Toltec (Mexico): One of the Tezcatlipocas (sons of the original dual god) transformed himself into the Sun and created the first humans to show up his brothers. The other gods, angry at his audacity, had Quetzalcoatl destroy the sun and the earth, which he did with a flood. >Inca (Peru): Pictorial records of ancient Incan rulers show that a flood rose above the highest mountains. All created things perished, except for a man and woman who floated in a box. >Eastern Brazil (Rio de Janiero region): Two twin sons of a great wizard, one good and the other evil, were always arguing. One day the angered good brother stamped so hard that the earth opened and water gushed out, shooting as high as the clouds. The water covered the whole world.  Sorry the post is so long.

For people who fight the notion/argument that God doesn't exist based on lack of evidence, that is not a valid argument. Even Atheists such as Richard Dawkins (considered a father of Atheism) rejects this idea and does not build his argument around it because even he understands that: The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. Also for those who argue that the definition of faith means to ""walk blindly"" is also incorrect. Contrary to popular belief, faith is not a reduction to fideism--which means we believe only from what we are told--that is a silly argument to defend and even Christians should reject this idea. Faith is NOT the belief without proof, rather it maintains a complete trust and confidence of something or someone. That sincere trust and faith in God is represented over a period of time based on extraordinary testimony and presence of Him being faithful to us. Christianity, as many of you know, is a faith-based religion. Faith in the Trinity (such as the Father, Son and Holy Spirit) and the Bible is a historical and parable book that guides Christians and asks people to trust in God.  Similarily, Atheists trust/have faith in Science. Science does not have all or produce all the answers. Just because Science cannot cure the common cold, should we reject that Science cannot help us? No. That would not be a fair argument. But as we have faith in the natural order, we should also consider the possibility of a supernatural one. There are multitudes of testimony from Atheists, Buddhists, Muslims, Satanists, etc. that have had experienced Jesus Christ and have converted--even though their entire lives were to preach against this message. I highly encourage people to look at fellow testimonies because it is backs evidence of the Bible.  Cheers!",1,0,JR D,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.14130434782608695,2014-01-21 05:55:36,True,True

(I gathered this based off of current debates below) Most Atheists argue and yet are limited in both their knowledge about Science and the Bible itself. These two are not a contradiction to each other, contrary to popular belief. Most Atheists don't understand the true definition of faith, so how can we have a debate if you have no concept of what faith actually means? If faith were indeed a reduction to Fideism than even Atheists would have to reject Science because they have faith in it.  It is unfortunate to see how Atheists do not have a good foundation even with their own faith--which is Science. The whole argument of ""God is not physically present therefore He cannot exist"" is BS and hypocritical. Your faith implores that you measure, understand and study things that are not physically present either--such as space, time and gravity. The laws of Thermodynamics (Second Law specifically) actually contradicts the Big Bang Theory, because if this actually happened (which it still is possible) the energy to create this universe had to have come from somewhere. Atheists please remember that the very Science that you so fiercely defend actually was constructed by smart, respected religious individuals--and while you maintain that many in time denied the existence of God (or rejected the notion of Him) many still have not. ",1,0,JR D,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.1603021978021978,2014-01-30 23:37:24,True,True

Think of the day you accepted god in your heart, whether it be through hardship or pain, or through joy and grace. Think of that day. You didn't accept him in your heart because of fear.

Two hours later I left the theater crying and changed,never had a movie touched me so much,now I am a pastor and I talk to atheists who want to come back to faith. That film inspired not only me, but there was a murder who killed someone 40 years ago, the movie touched him he went and confessed to the crime. Biblical films have ways of touching people, this film seems that it may do the same thing, I read that the director has a message in this film that is not shown until the that sums up everything the story of Noah is about, it is quiet surprising i guess.

Jehovah gave Noah special instructions to build a life-saving ark. They worked hard to build it. Jehovah told Noah to warn everyone. The non-believers probably said: You fools! Why are you building this huge box here? Your wasting your time! Our world is never going to end. But noah listened to god, and kept building. When the ark was done, Jehovah told Noah and his family: I will unleash the flood in just 7 days. So Noah took 8 elephants into the ark, and 2 of every other one.

2014-02-28T04:31:19,"There is one major flaw in this film already. And that is the portrayal of the Antediluvian human race being some pre-industrial, rudimentary-tool-using, medieval-type population! In a nutshell, any film or documentary about the period of time prior to the Great Flood, should portray them technologically very similar, if not superior to us today in 2014! There is more than ample evidence and facts to support the growing theory that ancient man was not some dumb, bumbling, knuckle-dragging, wife-clubbing, unga-bunga-ing race that didn't know what was over the next hill! On the contrary! The Bible speaks and hints of man's intelligence not to far from Adam and Eve, such as Jubal and Tubal-Cain (Note: Tubal-Cain's name even survived the Flood and changed as languages changed after Babel. Tubal-Cain eventually became Bal-Cain, then Bal-Can, Bulcan or Bulkan/Bilkan to Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, including volcanoes, usually depicted as a metalsmith with a hammer. Tubal-Cain was the original father of metallurgy, read in Genesis). Antediluvian people, individually lived an average of 700 to 1,000 years each, and all spoke a single language, some form of what we would today call Semitic. This, coupled with them most likely having a percentage of brain usage near 100%, and being far superior to us today not only mentally, but physically and genetically as well, there is no reason why they would not have rapidly developed technology equal to our own today, or better! And I don't mean ancient alien intervention either! No need for it! Adam and Eve would have been perfect and could speak from the start, so they also no doubt could read and write too, and most likely knew how Earth, the solar system, atmosphere, and outer space worked among many other things. They may have possessed telekinesis snd telepathy as well! It was their charge to pass on all of their God given knowledge to their offspring! By the time of Noah, several billion people would have been on Earth, possibly similar to our population today!

I don't know, but it must be considered. Another thing. Will they be showing dinosaurs and other ""prehistoric"" animals going on the ark? I highly doubt it!

2014-03-03T05:30:02,"How did only two people initially start the human race at Creation, and subsequently how did only eight people restart the human race after the Flood?  Adam and Eve were directly created by God which means they were humanly perfect. They had not yet sinned bringing down a curse upon all creation. Their DNA was flawless. They had no genetic load. Now, along with being perfect, they were also given the power and freedom of choice. God did not desire to make robots who only behaved and lived according to preprogramming. When put to the test, they chose to disobey God. This test was intentional and it gives man the choice to choose or reject God. This act brought sin, death, and imperfection into the world. However,  in spite of all of this, Adam lived to be 930 years old! Evolutionists and Creationists pretty much agree that the whole planet was once much warmer than today with a much richer and thicker atmosphere with much more carbon dioxide and oxygen than today. The difference is when. Biblically, this lush, subtropical, pleasant Earth existed prior to the Flood, when most of the surface water was locked into a subcrustal interconnected aquafer known as the hydroplate. The rest was diffused throughout the middle to upper atmosphere in a layer called a vaporsphere. This meant the Antediluvian (Pre-flood) world was very different than today. Instead of Earth's surface being 70% water to 30% land, it was just the opposite, 30% water to 70% land. At any rate, suffice to say, much thicker atmosphere than today. This, coupled with Adam and Eve being genetically, mentally, and physically perfect would have allowed for people to be much more verile and superior. Even after they fell from grace, their superiority didn't immediately come crashing down to our level today. For the whole Preflood era which lasted around 2,000 years, mankind had an average longevity of around 800 plus years. Adam and Eve had two sons, Cain and Able. Cain murdered Able out of jealosy. Cain was banished and moved east and it says he built a city and had a son, Enoch. Where did Cain get a wife? We must remember that around two millennia are covered in just a few chapters of Genesis. A lot of condensing and time lapsing is going on here. The Bible says Adam and Eve had another son, Seth. It goes on to say that Adam and Eve went on to have other sons and daughters, none mentioned by name. Living to be 930, I'm sure he could have fathered a small army! Cain married either a sister or cousin. Remember, at the beginnings, and apparently for the whole Preflood era, the gene pool remained pure, or extremely close to it. Then, after the Flood destroyed everything and killed all of the billions of people with only eight surviving - Noah and his wife and their three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth and their wives, it was a very similar scenario. They took with them their Preflood verility, superiority, and near perfect genetics. So again, brothers, sisters, cousins, nieces, and nephews marrying and having children posed no threat. But, changes had taken place during the flood that greatly thinned the atmosphere and removed the vaporsphere. This allowed for the first time, harmful cosmic and solar rays to penetrate to Earth's surface. As the generations passed after the Flood, you can read in the genealogies that longevity started to drop over time until it leveled off at around a 120 year average. Then over much more time eventually dropped down to around a 70 year longevity average. Today, we have an accumulated genetic load, mistakes and mutations in the DNA, that have built up. This can cause very close familial relations to have problems with their offspring such as retardation, deformation, or any other harmful birth defect. Even with a brother-sister copulation resulting in pregnancy, it must be noted, that with all of the genetic anomalies we have, there is still only a 50/50 chance of birth defects. Not good odds, but not what one would expect. This was a bit longwinded, but I hope it helped answer your question.",1,0,W Gaston,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.1825556835637481,2014-03-03 05:30:02,True,True
2014-03-03T05:57:53,"Back to the dinosaurs. Which dinosaurs were on the ark? Two of every kind. But, perhaps it would be sort of like dogs today. All the different dog breeds all descend back to wolves. It is possible that wolves, jackals, foxes, and coyotes all descend back to two base dog kinds on the ark. This same or similar scenario applies to other animals as well, which would include dinosaurs. There may have been different ""breeds"" of T-Rexes, Stegosaurs, Apatosaurs, etc., but all descending back to two originals. This would greatly reduce the animals on the ark. As for size problems. Take babies! That's a no-brainer! The largest dinosaur still had relatively small eggs and babies.  How did they go extinct? The fossil record is a result of those that perished and were quickly buried by the Flood. They did make a comeback after the Flood, but people, hunted them for sport, or because they feared a huge animal living close to home. So, these animals, especially the more dangerous ones such as the carnivores, were overhunted until they only existed in the most isolated and remote parts of Earth and even then constantly tetered on the brink of extinction. As with any animals, some more than others, when human population increases, animals decrease. Before the Flood, it wasn't as big a problem. The uniform warm climate, vegetation, and much-larger-than-Pangaea- super continent provided a much broader ecosystem to house these large animals. Antediluvia was better suited to life! Postdiluvia was riddled with opposing ecosystems, extreme hot and cold, wet and dry, rugged mountains, deep valleys, violent weather conditions, and smaller land areas. Dinosaurs and many other animals had a more difficult time, but were making it. People, over time, pushed them over the edge! There are oodles and oodles of dragon legends, depictions, drawings, and carvings, and they all pretty much are easily recognizable by even a child who knows their dinosaurs. The term ""dragon"" is merely the older word used for ""dinosaur"" since the latter term wasn't coined until the late 1800s. Thus dragon = dinosaur.  Even in the modern times, it's not certain they're all extinct. Nessie, Champ, Ogopogo, which are allegedly some type of plesiosaur. Mokele Mbembe is said to be an apatosaurus or similar dinosaur. There have been numerous reports of pterosaurs as well. The frauds, hoaxes, fakes, whiskey-goggles, and mistaken identities do exist, but all of them?! Not hardly!

But, I don't need man-inflicted wounds to know that dinosaurs and man coexisted. Again, the dinosaur and human footprints in the Paluxy River bed in Texas is irrefutable proof positive that man and dinosaurs coexisted. Different sources can claim what they want about the site, but one of the reasons it's a popular tourist site is because of this very fact - human and dinosaur tracks in the same layer of rock. Like I stated earlier, several tests were done that confirmed their authenticity. These tracks were put Book of Enigmas, Anolamies, or OOPARTS, along with hundreds of other things also because of their authenticity. Science has proven their reality, but it flies in the face of evolutionary thought, so, secular scientists don't know what to do with these anomalies, so they're conveniently discarded to a vast list of ""x-filed"" artefacts.

2014-03-07T08:18:04,"It's not merely my Christian opinion. If you want an opinion, here's one. Papa John's Pizza is better than Hungry Howies Pizza. There's an opinion for you. There are more than plenty of historical evidence and factual fossil evidence outside and independent of Christianity that holds it's own in the boxing ring of verification that humans and dinosaurs coexisted. Sediment layers as well as animals, during the Flood, were deposited according to similar consistancy and density. The bottom layers are not older, just denser. And there are many areas on Earth where the geologic column is totally different.  And one shred of evidence is all it sometimes takes to tie a murderer to his victim. Sometimes, depending on the bouncing ball, one fact alone can prove something true or false. Again, I bring forth Dinosaur Valley State Park on the Paluxy River in Texas where a flash flood in 1908 tore up a portion of the rock bottom exposing another layer with several dinosaur specie's footprints all over the place right along with human footprints IN THE SAME EXACT LAYER OF ROCK! Skeptics claimed it was fake. So, excavators dug up the surrounding rock layer and exposed many more of the same footprints. Some even overlapped each other. Still not good enough for the naysayers. So, some of the footprint-containing rocks were cut verifying that the striation sediment lines were pressed in and not carved, when it was soft mud. This is irrefutable facts that prove their coexistence and it would hold up in any sane, common sense court of law!  And what about the fossil shoe or boot print, complete with raised heel showing that when the print was made, the human who made it had stepped on a trilobite!  These are not opinions, but facts! If you could take these separate examples to some group of unbiased people somewhere on Earth that had never heard of evolution or creation, millions or billions of years, or anything similar, selected them for jury duty, and just presented them with all of the facts and evidence, they would conclude that whatever made those animal prints lived with the people that made their prints. Same goes for human and trilobite being contemporaries.  I can't speak for everybody, but if it came down to it, I'd much rather put my stock in some tangible, visible, concrete evidence that's staring me in the face, as opposed to some abstract dating methods that depend on other variables, or in dating rocks by fossils and fossils by rocks, or some other such circular reasoning and non sequiturs.  As for the birds-from-dinosaurs poppycock, well, need I say more!  And just so y'all know. I used to believe in evolution to a point, many years ago, that is, until I started really studying into all of it.

Noah had firm belief in the oneness of God, and preached Islam (literally ""submission,"" meaning submission to God) He continuously warned the people of the painful doom that was coming and asked them to accept one God instead of worshipping idols such as Wadd, Suwa', Yaghuth, Ya'uq and Nasr (Idols were worshiped that time) He called the people to serve God, and said that nobody but God could save them. He said that the time of the deluge was appointed and could not be delayed, and that the people had to submit to God. God commanded Noah to build a ship, the Ark, and as he was building it, the chieftains passed him and mocked him. Upon its completion, the ship is said to be loaded with pairs of every animal available that time, and Noah's household, and 76 believers who did submit to God. The people who denied the message of Noah, including one of his own sons, drowned.[28] The final resting place of the ship was referred to as Mount Judi.[29] Noah is called a grateful servant.[20] Both Noah and Abraham were taught the prophethood and the scripture",2,0,عبدالله فاضل,6qmj5mhDwJQ,-0.003124999999999989,2014-03-07 11:19:40,True,True

2014-03-09T01:58:38,"1.  God provides the best explanation of the origin of the universe.  Given the scientific evidence we have about our universe and its origins, and bolstered by arguments presented by philosophers for centuries, it is highly probable that the universe had an absolute beginning. Since the universe, like everything else, could not have merely popped into being without a cause, there must exist a transcendent reality beyond time and space that brought the universe into existence. This entity must therefore be enormously powerful. Only a transcendent, unembodied mind suitably fits that description.  2.  God provides the best explanation for the fine-tuning of the universe. Contemporary physics has established that the universe is fine-tuned for the existence of intelligent, interactive life.  That is to say, in order for intelligent, interactive life to exist, the fundamental constants and quantities of nature must fall into an incomprehensibly narrow life-permitting range.  There are three competing explanations of this remarkable fine-tuning: physical necessity, chance, or design. The first two are highly implausible, given the independence of the fundamental constants and quantities from nature's laws and the desperate maneuvers needed to save the hypothesis of chance. That leaves design as the best explanation.  3.  God provides the best explanation of objective moral values and duties. Even atheists recognize that some things, for example, the Holocaust, are objectively evil. But if atheism is true, what basis is there for the objectivity of the moral values we affirm? Evolution? Social conditioning? These factors may at best produce in us the subjective feeling that there are objective moral values and duties, but they do nothing to provide a basis for them. If human evolution had taken a different path, a very different set of moral feelings might have evolved. By contrast, God Himself serves as the paradigm of goodness, and His commandments constitute our moral duties. Thus, theism provides a better explanation of objective moral values and duties.   4.  God provides the best explanation of the historical facts concerning Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.  Historians have reached something of consensus that the historical Jesus thought that in himself God’s Kingdom had broken into human history, and he carried out a ministry of miracle-working and exorcisms as evidence of that fact.  Moreover, most historical scholars agree that after his crucifixion Jesus’ tomb was discovered empty by a group of female disciples, that various individuals and groups saw appearances of Jesus alive after his death, and that the original disciples suddenly and sincerely came to believe in Jesus’ resurrection despite their every predisposition to the contrary. I can think of no better explanation of these facts than the one the original disciples gave:  God raised Jesus from the dead.  5.  God can be personally known and experienced.  The proof of the pudding is in the tasting. Down through history Christians have found through Jesus a personal acquaintance with God that has transformed their lives.   The good thing is that atheists tend to be very passionate people and want to believe in something. If they would only put aside the slogans for a moment and reexamine their worldview in light of the best philosophical, scientific, and historical evidence we have today, then they, too, would find Christmas worth celebrating!",0,1,CmPunkBeast,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.194991452991453,2014-03-09 01:58:38,True,True

So resolve upon your plan and [call upon] your associates. Then let not your plan be obscure to you. Then carry it out upon me and do not give me respite. And if you turn away [from my advice] then no payment have I asked of you. My reward is only from Allah , and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims.""And they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship and made them successors, and We drowned those who denied Our signs.

Thus We seal over the hearts of the transgressors."" 10:71-74  ""Because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire, and they found not for themselves besides Allah [any] helpers. And Noah said, ""My Lord, do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers an inhabitant. Indeed, if You leave them, they will mislead Your servants and not beget except [every] wicked one and [confirmed] disbeliever. My Lord, forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house a believer and the believing men and believing women.

And We placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism, which they innovated; We did not prescribe it for them except [that they did so] seeking the approval of Allah .

2014-03-14T15:22:30,"When you consider the poetic nature of the Bible and its stories, it only makes sense that directors like Darren Aronofsky would direct a film centered around its themes and imagery. The man is highly existential (The Fountain). The fluid and interpretative nature of the work permits the director to artistically portray and, dare I say, expand on the various elements.  This foundation must be had prior to seeing his films. Unfortunately, theists and atheists are too caught up in their own preconceived biases towards anything remotely affiliated with the ""Bible"" that they would rather sacrifice the entire film rather than give it a fair chance. Theists are not required to associate their faith and beliefs with everything that's written in the Bible. And, likewise, atheists are not expected to shun those who affiliate their lives with specific teachings. Both groups are certainly attempting to prop themselves up on some kind of intellectual pedestal which is, frankly speaking, a goal that is impossible for either group to obtain.   Who knows.

I know some shows and movies, when they try to re create a story, they often times change things around so it's not too similar to the book. I think in this case they shouldn't have gone with that particular instinct. It is a biblical story we are talking about here! Altering it would only cause a commotion within the Christian community, and if the propose of this movie was to bring people to God, it should have been more biblical. This isn't at all showcasing what really happened in the bible with this story, and showing the public things like this will not only give people false information, but other ""biblical"" movies will be made that are nothing like the real story.

2014-03-19T20:57:42,"  Guys, you're claiming that the story of Noah was a fairy tale. Let's take this in consideration. The book of Genesis (that includes the story of Noah) was written a few thousand years before Jesus Christ was born. (we all know that) Now Noah was the 10th generation son from Adam's lineage (based on Genesis 5). So let's take the lineage from Adam to Noah. Adam, Seth, Enosh, Cainan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, and Lamech bore Noah. Back in the days, either God told people to name their children names or people named them because there was a reason to name them the way they named them. So if you take these 10 names and see their meaning (e.g. Adam means ""Man"") then you come up with this sentence: ""Man, Appointed, Mortal, Sorrow, The Blessed God, Shall Come Down, Teaching, His Death Shall Bring, The Despairing, Comfort (or Rest)"" That shoots an arrow straight towards Jesus Christ. So you want to tell me that men who wrote ""this Fairy tale"" knew that Jesus Christ will be born in this world, claim he is God and that he needs to die for the sins of the world so that people will find everlasting life through Jesus because He said ""I'm the way, truth and life, no one comes to the Father except through me"" ? Try to explain that one = ) ﻿",15,5,lucky258i,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.06888888888888887,2014-03-19 20:57:42,True,True

( 4 )   Allah will forgive you of your sins and delay you for a specified term. Indeed, the time [set by] Allah, when it comes, will not be delayed, if you only knew.' "" ( 5 )   He said, ""My Lord, indeed I invited my people [to truth] night and day. ( 6 )   But my invitation increased them not except in flight. ( 7 )   And indeed, every time I invited them that You may forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears, covered themselves with their garments, persisted, and were arrogant with [great] arrogance. ( 8 )   Then I invited them publicly. ( 9 )   Then I announced to them and [also] confided to them secretly ( 11 )   He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers ( 12 )   And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers. ( 13 )   What is [the matter] with you that you do not attribute to Allah [due] grandeur ( 14 )   While He has created you in stages? ( 15 )   Do you not consider how Allah has created seven heavens in layers ( 16 )   And made the moon therein a [reflected] light and made the sun a burning lamp? ( 17 )   And Allah has caused you to grow from the earth a [progressive] growth. ( 18 )   Then He will return you into it and extract you [another] extraction. ( 19 )   And Allah has made for you the earth an expanse ( 20 )   That you may follow therein roads of passage.' "" ( 21 )   Noah said, ""My Lord, indeed they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children will not increase him except in loss. ( 22 )   And they conspired an immense conspiracy. ( 23 )   And said, 'Never leave your gods and never leave Wadd or Suwa' or Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr. ( 24 )   And already they have misled many. And, [my Lord], do not increase the wrongdoers except in error."" ( 25 )   Because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire, and they found not for themselves besides Allah [any] helpers. ( 26 )   And Noah said, ""My Lord, do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers an inhabitant. ( 27 )   Indeed, if You leave them, they will mislead Your servants and not beget except [every] wicked one and [confirmed] disbeliever.

Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day."" ( 27 )   So the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said, ""We do not see you but as a man like ourselves, and we do not see you followed except by those who are the lowest of us [and] at first suggestion. And we do not see in you over us any merit; rather, we think you are liars."" ( 28 )   He said, ""O my people have you considered: if I should be upon clear evidence from my Lord while He has given me mercy from Himself but it has been made unapparent to you, should we force it upon you while you are averse to it? ( 29 )   And O my people, I ask not of you for it any wealth. My reward is not but from Allah. And I am not one to drive away those who have believed. Indeed, they will meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly. ( 30 )   And O my people, who would protect me from Allah if I drove them away? Then will you not be reminded? ( 31 )   And I do not tell you that I have the depositories [containing the provision] of Allah or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel, nor do I say of those upon whom your eyes look down that Allah will never grant them any good. Allah is most knowing of what is within their souls. Indeed, I would then be among the wrongdoers."" ( 32 )   They said, ""O Noah, you have disputed us and been frequent in dispute of us. So bring us what you threaten us, if you should be of the truthful."" ( 33 )   He said, ""Allah will only bring it to you if He wills, and you will not cause [Him] failure. ( 34 )   And my advice will not benefit you - although I wished to advise you - If Allah should intend to put you in error. He is your Lord, and to Him you will be returned."" ( 35 )   Or do they say [about Prophet Muhammad], ""He invented it""? Say, ""If I have invented it, then upon me is [the consequence of] my crime; but I am innocent of what [crimes] you commit."" ( 36 )   And it was revealed to Noah that, ""No one will believe from your people except those who have already believed, so do not be distressed by what they have been doing. ( 37 )   And construct the ship under Our observation and Our inspiration and do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are [to be] drowned."" ( 38 )   And he constructed the ship, and whenever an assembly of the eminent of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, ""If you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule. ( 39 )   And you are going to know who will get a punishment that will disgrace him [on earth] and upon whom will descend an enduring punishment [in the Hereafter]."" ( 40 )   [So it was], until when Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, ""Load upon the ship of each [creature] two mates and your family, except those about whom the word has preceded, and [include] whoever has believed."" But none had believed with him, except a few. ( 41 )   And [Noah] said, ""Embark therein; in the name of Allah is its course and its anchorage. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."" ( 42 )   And it sailed with them through waves like mountains, and Noah called to his son who was apart [from them], ""O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers."" ( 43 )   [But] he said, ""I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water."" [Noah] said, ""There is no protector today from the decree of Allah, except for whom He gives mercy."" And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned. ( 44 )   And it was said, ""O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, withhold [your rain]."" And the water subsided, and the matter was accomplished, and the ship came to rest on the [mountain of] Judiyy. And it was said, ""Away with the wrongdoing people."" ( 45 )   And Noah called to his Lord and said, ""My Lord, indeed my son is of my family; and indeed, Your promise is true; and You are the most just of judges!"" ( 46 )   He said, ""O Noah, indeed he is not of your family; indeed, he is [one whose] work was other than righteous, so ask Me not for that about which you have no knowledge. Indeed, I advise you, lest you be among the ignorant."" ( 47 )   [Noah] said, ""My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers."" ( 48 )   It was said, ""O Noah, disembark in security from Us and blessings upon you and upon nations [descending] from those with you. But other nations [of them] We will grant enjoyment; then there will touch them from Us a painful punishment."" ( 49 )   That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Muhammad]. You knew it not, neither you nor your people, before this.

Then you people came up with a fake story of Noah in order to mislead people all around the world. There is not a single truth in this movie as far as the true words of God concerns. We heard about that mountain collapsed in Washington, which you guys were part of it.   People came up with the word “Bible,” meaningless. Yet in Aramaic and Arabic language its actual name is “Enjee”. You have heard of “Evangelists”, or “Evangelina” as a girl’s name. They are from the same root “Enjeel” and it Dose not mean “Angel”. Then they came up with the name “Jesus” meaningless. Yet, his name is “E-saw” in Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic language, and it means “The Hour”. His name was a sign to unveil the Hour of the End of the world. It seems like descendants of satan, meaning “jinns”, they came up with so many fake and meaningless names, and they used their initial as the first letter “J” of their fake names. Like, Jesus, Jacob, Joseph, Joshua, John, Jonah, James, Jude, Jethro, Jonathon,,, all meaningless. But in Arabic, Aramaic and Hebrew they all have beautiful meanings.

I went trying to give Hollywood the benefit of the doubt, knowing that they would need to add some artistic interpretation given the small storyline from Genesis.  However, when Hollywood injected the idea that Noah couldn't get answers from God and wanted to murder his granddaughter, I couldn't stand it anymore. I was disgusted by the portrayal of an axe wielding Noah who kills countless people. I was appalled by the fact that they made up a storyline that a bad guy secretly snuck on to the boat and conspired with Ham to kill Noah while on the boat. I was offended that they portrayed a prophet as a man not preaching repentance but as a man determined to end the human race including his own family. Besides the fact that there is a man with a boat and animals, this movie in no way follows the story found in Genesis.  With only three chapters about Noah, it is surprising how many errors this movie has compared to its biblical telling (eg. age of noah, sons all took wives on to boat, length of ark stay, his interaction with his father and Methuselah, in Bible it said Noah walked with God etc).  I didn't find out until after the fact the Noah’s Film atheist director Darren Aronofsky Calls 'Noah' The 'Least Biblical Film Ever Made"" (Huffington Post).",0,0,drmarkfletcher,6qmj5mhDwJQ,-0.07619047619047617,2014-03-30 05:27:53,False,True

I convey to you the messages of my Lord and advise you; and I know from Allah what you do not know.

2014-04-01T00:38:59,"Christianity is a LIE. The True teachings of Christ have been Manipulated and Distorted by PAGANS and LUCIFERIANS.  Jesus is not the Messiah's name. There are no J's in the Hebrew Alphabet. The letter J wasn't even Invented until the 1600s. The first 1611 King James Bible didn't have the name ""Jesus"" in it but Iesous. Then once they took out the Book of Enoch and the Apocrypha they switched the name Iesous with Jesus. Iesous is GREEK spelling of the messiah's name and Zeus was a God(Fallen Angel also known as Jupiter) worshiped in GREEK Mythology. That's no coincidence. It's also no coincidence that Jesus, Iesous, Zeus are all corresponding related words. Jesus is Esoteric for Zeus. No where in the Bible did God authorize MAN to ""translate"" or change the messiah's name(Yeshua) which means God is Salvation(God is our Savior).  Joseph and Mary never gave birth to the Son of God. They gave birth to a Prophet named Immanuel. And humans switched his name to make it look like Christ was a Physical Human being when really he was an Extraterrestrial.  Isaiah 7:14 - Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  How can a Virgin be pregnant? Does that make ANY sense? They switched the word Virgin with Almah. Almah in Hebrew means Young Woman so really a Young Woman gave birth to a boy named Immanuel.  Where is ""Jesus"" childhood in the Bible? You can't find it anywhere and no it's not in Luke 2:40 that is clearly talking about Immanuel not Christ. The reason his childhood or teenage pre-adult hood isn't in the Bible and he goes from being a BABY to a GROWN MAN so fast is because he was never a PHYSICAL human being he was an Extraterrestrial. Which is why he could do the things he did, he was HEAVENLY SENT. Humans manipulated the Bible to HIDE this.  Christ was REALLY born in Heaven not Earth. Read Revelations 12:1-6 which talks about the birth of the Son of God in Heaven. This is how the War began in Heaven when the Devil went after Gods Throne. There's a KEYWORD in this verse that says the woman(who gave birth to Christ) was prepared for safety for about 1,200 days which means the war must of took on for that long. Which means there's MORE to what REALLY HAPPENED than what this scripture talks about(because most people will assume it happened in just one day).  No wonder there was once Life on Mars and there are abandoned planets in Space. It all goes back to the past life. The Planets in Space such as Neptunes, Venus, Mars, Jupiter(Zeus) etc are Fallen Angel Planets. It all goes back to the past life when everything was Aligned before Lucifer fell as an Angel. This is why God sent his Son. God didn't send his ""Biological Son"" he sent his SON as in his SUN meaning his LIGHT to LIFE. The word Sun comes from the Old English word Sunne. Just like the word Son comes from the old German word Sonne. Sonne is also Sunne in Middle High German. German is older than the English Language which proves my point, they're both corresponding words.  John 8:12 - Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the LIGHT of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in DARKNESS, but shall have the LIGHT of LIFE  The Sun here on Earth as we know it is the LIGHT of LIFE.  Christ was a LIGHT(Extraterrestrial) that descended from Heaven during the Dark Ages after Lucifer fell as an Angel not a Physical Human Being. PROOF  John 6:38 - For I came DOWN from HEAVEN, not to do mine OWN will, but the will of HIM that sent me.  John 3:17 - For God sent not his Son INTO the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  When the Son of God was telling them they don't have to walk in Darkness he was dealing with the people in the PAST LIFE after Lucifer fell as an Angel during the Dark Ages. The Bible is a book that deals with the PAST LIFE. Egypt is a Structured Symbol from the PAST LIFE. Egypt was the ""Underworld"" V that Lucifer reigned over in the past life that merged with Atlantis ^(God). Before he fell as an Angel.  If you look on the back of your ""ONE"" dollar bill you will see 11:11 SUBLIMINALLY. 11:11 is a Whole Number which consist of Negatives and Positives. One Eleven belongs to God. One Eleven belongs to the Devil. It all goes back to the PAST LIFE when we were all ""one"". Which is why you see the Egyptian Pyramid. The Pyramid is actually a Diamond built into specs from Top ^ to Bottom V. merging together as ""one"" forming a Diamond. It all goes back to the past life when we were all ""one"". Before Lucifer fell as an Angel.  Watch Michael Jackson's video ""Remember the Time"" you will see the Sand Timer in the Beginning of the video this is where the ""As it is Above, so it is Below"" concept comes from. When Atlantis ^ merged with Egypt(The Underworld). How funny Michael Jackson went into the past life in Egypt in his video ""Remember the time"" and there's an ACTUAL statue of Michael Jackson from past life Egypt. Don't believe me, look it up ""Ancient Egyptian Statue Michael Jackson"". He appears as an Alien/Angel to the Egyptians through-out the entire video. He was Incarnated Archangel Michael.  Yes the Egyptians and Hebrews WERE Black. Egypt itself means Kemet which means Black and Fertile land. Yes the Hebrews WERE Black. Read Deuteronomy 28:68 as well as Genesis 15:13 our Black History is right there in the Bible. No where in History did ""Jewish"" people go into Slavery with Ships.  Like I said, the Bible deals with the PAST LIFE. Everything is already written, which is why we experience Dejavu because it ALREADY HAPPENED. Read Jeremiah 29:11 which proves my point that everything is already written. How else do you think the Bible was able to prophecy what's going to happen? Because it's ALREADY WRITTEN.  The true teachings of Christ have been Distorted. Humans have manipulated and altered the Bible and have deceived the world with Christianity which is a Esoteric Pagan Religion.  The word 'Amen"" is a ERROR ""translated""(inserted) word from the Hebrew word Omein. Amen is Esoteric for Amon which is why you hear some people pronounce it ""Amon"" instead of Amen. Amon(RA) was an Egyptian God deity so when you say Amen/Amon you are honoring the Egyptian God deity Amon. No where in the Bible does it say it is Mandatory to use the word Amen after Prayer.  The word Easter was switched with the word Passover. Easter is a pagan ritual that comes from the Goddess of Ishtar and Fertility(Bunnies do not lay Eggs).  Christ wasn't born on December 25th, Nimrod was. Christmas is also a pagan holiday. Santa is really Satan and his little Elves are his Demons. How did they get the name Satan Claws oops I mean Santa Clause* from Old Saint Nick anyways? The five pointed star on the top of the Tree is the Goat Head and when you open your Gifts you subliminally BOW to the Tree. It's all Satanic. The Bible tells you not to put a tree in your house anyways.  Study the Torah & Tanakh and you'll see how humans have manipulated the Bible.  God is our Savior not ""Jesus"" GOD is the one who chose to send his Son so that the world could be saved, his Son didn't SEND himself. Again  John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 6:38 - For I came DOWN from HEAVEN, not to do mine OWN will, but the will of HIM that sent me.  There is only One God and that is the Most High.  1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,  Isaiah 44:6 - Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.  Isaiah 43:11 - I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no savior.  John 10:30 - I and the Father are one.”  You really think God was some blonde hair blue eyed white guy(Cesare Borgia) in a Dress and and some Flip Flops who sounds like Shakespeare?  ""Woe, Unto Thee, For I say, Shall, Behold!' come on people. God is an Advanced Alien which is why your Luciferian Government has been preparing you all for what is yet to come with all these Deceptive Alien movies such as War of the Worlds.

Someone who read the actual novel expects the movie to be an accurate recreation of the novel and if not they get disappointed by the severe changes. If for example you go to watch a movie called “Cinderella” and in the movie Cinderella is a serial killer you will react saying that the movie is not the true Cinderella story. It doesn't matter whether the story is a fairy tale or real.  Similarly someone who read the Bible expects the Noah movie to stick to the actual Noah story described in the Bible. It doesn't matter whether what is described in a Bible is fictional or real.  The worse is my opinion with the changes in the Noah story presented in the movie Vs to what is described in the Bible is that it twists things in such a way to present Christianity to non-knowledgeable people as a wrong/vicious/immoral religion not worth believing and reinforcing the atheism advocates. Well the truth is Bible and Christianity in general preach love and solidarity.

Noah build his arc over desert for which he was mocked by his nation (according to Islamic triditions) , not over green plains as protrayed in this film. Noah by all account was ancient Pakistani who and whos followers on arc build the world most ancient known country/civilization called Indus along the banks of Indus river. His sons are buried in northern Pakistan in those giant ancient graves. He is perhaps the only prophet , atleast that I am aware of , which has got reverence and mention in Hinduism as well and they remember him by name MA-NU, same description of the man who saved humanity in great floods. In Islam he is called Nuh. For Hindus being the close to the lands of Pakistan to know him is a tele tele sign. It is not a rocket science to see the evolution of human civilization came from Indus , to Babylon and then to Egypt.

But many of the animals on the ark were carnivores. We can't eat meat, no. But a lion can?  Noah Kills a man for killing an animal for food. (HYPOCRITICAL) When did animals become more important than a human being?  One moment in the movie Noah's son picks a flower, and Noah tells him he shouldn't do that, and yet the whole basis of the story is revolved around cutting down trees and using it to build a big ark.  They also used a Jewish tradition and made it seem demonic. Noah raps his arm with snake skin, from the same snake that tempted Adam and eve (aka the Devil) The movie made it seem that Noah gave the Devil's blessing to his grandchildren. What THE heck?  And fallen angels aka (DEMONS) were good. I see this movie as a fantasy movie nothing more. If you haven't read the bible and/or other religious texts, and think that  this is really close to the story try reading it for yourself, and you will notice a huge difference. There is actually less fantasy in the real story. Trust me. The story of Noah is what I like to call a legend, and if you're going to do a movie about a legend you should make it as close as possible to the original text considering 3 major religions of the world cherish this story.

Someone tell this ignorant fool that Noah preached for more then 900 years!! , god damn 900 years to his people to come to right path , and according to Islamic traditions only 8 of them (some triditions tell they were 80), who listened to him. Its beyond a normal human comprehension to understand the patience and determination of the man Noah was. But there comes a time where something has to give in.  Quran (Surah Nuh)  Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, [saying], ""Warn your people before there comes to them a painful punishment."" He said, ""O my people, indeed I am to you a clear warner, [Saying], 'Worship Allah , fear Him and obey me. Allah will forgive you of your sins and delay you for a specified term. Indeed, the time [set by] Allah , when it comes, will not be delayed, if you only knew.' "" He said, ""My Lord, indeed I invited my people [to truth] night and day. But my invitation increased them not except in flight. And indeed, every time I invited them that You may forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears, covered themselves with their garments, persisted, and were arrogant with [great] arrogance. Then I invited them publicly. Then I announced to them and [also] confided to them secretly And said, 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers. What is [the matter] with you that you do not attribute to Allah [due] grandeur While He has created you in stages? Do you not consider how Allah has created seven heavens in layers And made the moon therein a [reflected] light and made the sun a burning lamp? And Allah has caused you to grow from the earth a [progressive] growth. Then He will return you into it and extract you [another] extraction. And Allah has made for you the earth an expanse That you may follow therein roads of passage.' "" Noah said, ""My Lord, indeed they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children will not increase him except in loss. And they conspired an immense conspiracy. And said, 'Never leave your gods and never leave Wadd or Suwa' or Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr. And already they have misled many. And, [my Lord], do not increase the wrongdoers except in error."" Because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire, and they found not for themselves besides Allah [any] helpers. And Noah said, ""My Lord, do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers an inhabitant. Indeed, if You leave them, they will mislead Your servants and not beget except [every] wicked one and [confirmed] disbeliever. My Lord, forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house a believer and the believing men and believing women.

This, in turn, prompted God to make the Great Flood.  These fallen angels, The Watchers (Also known as the Grigori) were never allies like in this movie. In reality, they were actually the ones who made the Nephlim and are the ones who brung forbiddne knowledge to humans such as sorcery, weaponry, cosmetics, and others.

Also, Noah was like 700 years old when he built the Ark, and died age 950. In fact, of the 10 generations of pre-flood patriarchs, all but two of them lived to be over 900 -- Lamech died at age 777, and Enoch didnt die but was ""taken away"" by god at the young age of 360. And those two examples are just off the top of my head. This movie is only ""blasphemous"" because it exposes how bizarre some of the content in the Old Testament actually is.  Seriously, compare the miracles that happen in the New Testament to the fantastic (as in fantasy-like) stuff that happens in the Old Testament -- the Old Testament is like an action movie in comparison. In Christianity, the Old Testement is probably half as important as the New Testament - Creation and the 10 Commandments.are the only parts that are even referenced frequently. Probably because its too much associated with the Jews.",0,1,Wh0rse,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.11711647727272728,2014-04-04 23:48:47,False,True

2014-04-05T18:03:21,"Christianity is a LIE. The True teachings of Christ have been Manipulated and Distorted by PAGANS and LUCIFERIANS.  Jesus is not the Messiah's name. There are no J's in the Hebrew Alphabet. The letter J wasn't even Invented until the 1600s. The first 1611 King James Bible didn't have the name ""Jesus"" in it but Iesous. Then once they took out the Book of Enoch and the Apocrypha they switched the name Iesous with Jesus. Iesous is GREEK spelling of the messiah's name and Zeus was a God(Fallen Angel also known as Jupiter) worshiped in GREEK Mythology. That's no coincidence. It's also no coincidence that Jesus, Iesous, Zeus are all corresponding related words. Jesus is Esoteric for Zeus. No where in the Bible did God authorize MAN to ""translate"" or change the messiah's name(Yeshua) which means God is Salvation(God is our Savior). You don't translate NAMES anyway but WORDS and their MEANINGS.  Joseph and Mary never gave birth to the Son of God. They gave birth to a Prophet named Immanuel. And humans switched his name to make it look like Christ was a Physical Human being when really he was an Extraterrestrial.  Isaiah 7:14 - Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  How can a Virgin be pregnant? Does that make ANY sense? They switched the word Virgin with Almah. Almah in Hebrew means Young Woman so really a Young Woman gave birth to a boy named Immanuel.  Where is ""Jesus"" childhood in the Bible? You can't find it anywhere and no it's not in Luke 2:40 that is clearly talking about Immanuel not Christ. The reason his childhood or teenage pre-adult hood isn't in the Bible and he goes from being a BABY to a GROWN MAN so fast is because he was never a PHYSICAL human being he was an Extraterrestrial. Which is why he could do the things he did, he was HEAVENLY SENT. Humans manipulated the Bible to HIDE this.  Christ was REALLY born in Heaven not Earth. Read Revelations 12:1-6 which talks about the birth of the Son of God in Heaven. This is how the War began in Heaven when the Devil went after Gods Throne. There's a KEYWORD in this verse that says the woman(who gave birth to Christ) was prepared for safety for about 1,200 days which means the war must of took on for that long. Which means there's MORE to what REALLY HAPPENED than what this scripture talks about(because most people will assume it happened in just one day).  No wonder there was once Life on Mars and there are abandoned planets in Space. It all goes back to the past life. The Planets in Space such as Neptunes, Venus, Mars, Jupiter(Zeus) etc are Fallen Angel Planets. It all goes back to the past life when everything was Aligned before Lucifer fell as an Angel. This is why God sent his Son. God didn't send his ""Biological Son"" he sent his SON as in his SUN meaning his LIGHT to LIFE. The word Sun comes from the Old English word Sunne. Just like the word Son comes from the old German word Sonne. Sonne is also Sunne in Middle High German. German is older than the English Language which proves my point, they're both corresponding words.  John 8:12 - Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the LIGHT of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in DARKNESS, but shall have the LIGHT of LIFE  The Sun here on Earth as we know it is the LIGHT of LIFE.  Christ was a LIGHT(Extraterrestrial) that descended from Heaven during the Dark Ages after Lucifer fell as an Angel not a Physical Human Being. PROOF  John 6:38 - For I came DOWN from HEAVEN, not to do mine OWN will, but the will of HIM that sent me.  John 3:17 - For God sent not his Son INTO the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  When the Son of God was telling them they don't have to walk in Darkness he was dealing with the people in the PAST LIFE after Lucifer fell as an Angel during the Dark Ages. The Bible is a book that deals with the PAST LIFE. Egypt is a Structured Symbol from the PAST LIFE. Egypt was the ""Underworld"" V that Lucifer reigned over in the past life that merged with Atlantis ^(God). Before he fell as an Angel.  If you look on the back of your ""ONE"" dollar bill you will see 11:11 SUBLIMINALLY. 11:11 is a Whole Number which consist of Negatives and Positives. One Eleven belongs to God. One Eleven belongs to the Devil. It all goes back to the PAST LIFE when we were all ""one"". Which is why you see the Egyptian Pyramid. The Pyramid is actually a Diamond built into specs from Top ^ to Bottom V. merging together as ""one"" forming a Diamond. It all goes back to the past life when we were all ""one"". Before Lucifer fell as an Angel.  Watch Michael Jackson's video ""Remember the Time"" you will see the Sand Timer in the Beginning of the video this is where the ""As it is Above, so it is Below"" concept comes from. When Atlantis ^ merged with Egypt(The Underworld). How funny Michael Jackson went into the past life in Egypt in his video ""Remember the time"" and there's an ACTUAL statue of Michael Jackson from past life Egypt. Don't believe me, look it up ""Ancient Egyptian Statue Michael Jackson"". He appears as an Alien/Angel to the Egyptians through-out the entire video. He was Incarnated Archangel Michael.  Yes the Egyptians and Hebrews WERE Black. Egypt itself means Kemet which means Black and Fertile land. Yes the Hebrews WERE Black. Read Deuteronomy 28:68 as well as Genesis 15:13 our Black History is right there in the Bible. No where in History did ""Jewish"" people go into Slavery with Ships.  Like I said, the Bible deals with the PAST LIFE. Everything is already written, which is why we experience Dejavu because it ALREADY HAPPENED. Read Jeremiah 29:11 which proves my point that everything is already written. How else do you think the Bible was able to prophecy what's going to happen? Because it's ALREADY WRITTEN.  The true teachings of Christ have been Distorted. Humans have manipulated and altered the Bible and have deceived the world with Christianity which is a Esoteric Pagan Religion.  The word 'Amen"" is a ERROR ""translated""(inserted) word from the Hebrew word Omein. Amen is Esoteric for Amon which is why you hear some people pronounce it ""Amon"" instead of Amen. Amon(RA) was an Egyptian God deity so when you say Amen/Amon you are honoring the Egyptian God deity Amon. No where in the Bible does it say it is Mandatory to use the word Amen after Prayer.  The word Easter was switched with the word Passover. Easter is a pagan ritual that comes from the Goddess of Ishtar and Fertility(Bunnies do not lay Eggs).  Christ wasn't born on December 25th, Nimrod was. Christmas is also a pagan holiday. Santa is really Satan and his little Elves are his Demons. How did they get the name Satan Claws oops I mean Santa Clause* from Old Saint Nick anyways? The five pointed star on the top of the Tree is the Goat Head and when you open your Gifts you subliminally BOW to the Tree. It's all Satanic. The Bible tells you not to put a tree in your house anyways.(Jeremiah 10:1-4)  Study the Torah & Tanakh and you'll see how humans have manipulated the Bible.  God is our Savior not ""Jesus"" GOD is the one who chose to send his Son so that the world could be saved, his Son didn't SEND himself. Again  John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 6:38 - For I came DOWN from HEAVEN, not to do mine OWN will, but the will of HIM that sent me.  There is only One God and that is the Most High.  1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,  Isaiah 44:6 - Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.  Isaiah 43:11 - I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no savior.

2014-04-07T02:45:55,"The true story of NOAH PBUH:  Nûḥ (Arabic: نوح, translit.: Nūḥ),[1] known as Noah in the Old Testament, is recognized in Islam as a prophet and apostle of God (Arabic: الله‎ Allāh). He is a highly important figure in Islamic history, as he is counted amongst the earliest prophets sent by God to mankind.[2] According to Islam, Noah's mission was to save a wicked world, plunged in (Mainly Polytheism and worshipping Idols, just like the christians Polytheism worshiping Jesus and Marry)* depravity and sin. God charged Noah with the duty of preaching to his people to make them abandon idolatry and to worship only the One Creator and to live good and pure lives.[3] Although he preached the Message of God with immense zeal, his people refused to mend their ways, leading to his building of the Ark and the famous event of the Deluge, the Great Flood in which all the evil people of his time perished. Noah preached faith in God for 950 years according to Quran.[4]  Noah's mission had a double character: he had to warn his people, asking them to call for repentance and, at the same time, he had to preach about God's mercy and forgiveness, promising them the glad tidings God would provide if they led righteous lives. References to Noah are scattered throughout the Qur'an, and there is even an entire chapter carrying his name, Noah.[5]  From Wikipedia. *Mine",1,0,zaloskahfk bdognryvn genbdf,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.1804303539597657,2014-04-07 02:45:55,False,True

And I am not saying this as a Hardcore Religion Fan more like a person who had read the book. I know  that Noah movie is only 3 chapters and left to many thing to a 2 hours movie. But the changes they made were unacceptable. 1) Angels were never here on earth to help. Indeed they were the ones who actually made the big mess on earth because they came to earth to have sex with women. And just for that. 2) The hybrid sons of the angels with women were the giants, not the watchers. And they didn't have an elemental form of rocks, they were simple giant humans about 3m to 5m tall 3) Noah took about 40 years to build the ark 4) All of their son were married when they entered the ark and that is really important  Like I said I am reader not a hardcore fan.

A lot of tasteful, appropriate and interesting imagery.  It takes some liberties with the Biblical story (which in turn took liberties with the Babylonian one), So if you are of the ""Biblical inerrancy rulz"" clan, then this movie might not be for you.  Early chapters of the Book of Genesis are some of my favorite (and I am an atheist).  Too bad (or maybe good?) they can't make a movie for Ecclesiastes, Proverbs or Job - the other gems of the Bible. In either case, the flood story is a very good myth and the quality of the movie lives up to it - in my opinion.  So, basically, with a few caveat emptors I highly recommend it.

The notables who disbelieved among his people said, ""We see in you nothing but a man like us, and we see that only the worst among us have followed you, those of immature judgment. And we see that you have no advantage over us. In fact, we think you are liars.""  28. He said, ""O my people, Have you considered? If I stand on clear evidence from my Lord, and He has given me a mercy from Himself, but you were blind to it, can we compel you to accept it, even though you dislike it?""  29. ""O my people! I ask of you no money for it. My reward lies only with God. And I am not about to dismiss those who believed; they will surely meet their Lord. And I see that you are ignorant people.""  30. ""O my people! Who will support me against God, if I dismiss them? Will you not give a thought?""  31. ""I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of God, nor do I know the future, nor do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say of those who are despicable in your eyes that God will never give them any good. God is Aware of what lies in their souls. If I did, I would be one of the wrongdoers.""  32. They said, ""O Noah, you have argued with us, and argued a great deal. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are truthful.""  33. He said, ""It is God who will bring it upon you, if He wills, and you will not be able to escape.""  34. ""My advice will not benefit you, much as I may want to advise you, if God desires to confound you. He is your Lord, and to Him you will be returned.""  35. Or do they say, ""He made it up?"" Say, ""If I made it up, upon me falls my crime, and I am innocent of the crimes you commit.""  36. And it was revealed to Noah: ""None of your people will believe, except those who have already believed, so do not grieve over what they do.""  37. ""And build the Ark, under Our eyes, and with Our inspiration, and do not address Me regarding those who did wrong; they are to be drowned.""  38. As he was building the ark, whenever some of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, ""If you ridicule us, we will ridicule you, just as you ridicule.""  39. ""You will surely know upon whom will come a torment that will abase him, and upon whom will fall a lasting torment.""  40. Until, when Our command came, and the volcano erupted, We said, ""Board into it a pair of every kind, and your family-except those against whom the sentence has already been passed-and those who have believed."" But those who believed with him were only a few.  41. He said, ""Embark in it. In the name of God shall be its sailing and its anchorage. My Lord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.""  42. And so it sailed with them amidst waves like hills. And Noah called to his son, who had kept away, ""On my son! Embark with us, and do not be with the disbelievers.""  43. He said, ""I will take refuge on a mountain-it will protect me from the water."" He said, ""There is no protection from God's decree today, except for him on whom He has mercy."" And the waves surged between them, and he was among the drowned.  44. And it was said, ""O earth, swallow your waters,"" and ""O heaven, clear up."" And the waters receded, and the event was concluded, and it settled on Judi, and it was proclaimed: ""Away with the wicked people.""  45. And Noah called to his Lord. He said, ""O My Lord, my son is of my family, and Your promise is true, and You are the Wisest of the wise.""  46. He said, ""O Noah, he is not of your family. It is an unrighteous deed. So do not ask Me about something you know nothing about. I admonish you, lest you be one of the ignorant.""  47. He said, ""O My Lord, I seek refuge with You, from asking You about what I have no knowledge of. Unless You forgive me, and have mercy on me, I will be one of the losers.""  48. It was said, ""O Noah, disembark with peace from Us; and with blessings upon you, and upon communities from those with you. And other communities We will grant prosperity, and then a painful torment from Us will befall them.""  49. These are some stories from the past that we reveal to you.

Fossils cannot form by slow burial over millions of years, because predators and parasites would devour a dead creature within weeks, and its bones scattered. This fact debunks the geologic column and further gives credence to the worldwide Flood, because most fossils are articulated fossils, which means, they're found with the bones connected, and they're found preserved. Fossilization requires a quick burial, as from mudslides that were caused by a Flood, otherwise, as I've already pointed out, the creatures' bones would be scattered, and predators and parasites would devour a creature so that nothing is preserved. The OBSERVABLE facts back up the biblical account of the worldwide Flood, while at the same time, debunks Darwinism.  Another fact, which many evolutionary scientists have admitted, including Stephen J. Gould, Colin Patterson, and Niles Eldredge, is that the transitional or intermediate fossils are completely ABSENT from the fossil record.

The fact it was eating shows that the flood would have landed and quickly frozen due to the big temperature change and therefore it was covered in ice WHILE eating, which could not happen if there wasn't a flood, since it wouldn't be so instantaneous.

He is a highly important figure in Islamic history, as he is counted amongst the earliest prophets sent by God to mankind. According to Islam, Noah's mission was to save a wicked world, plunged in depravity and sin. God charged Noah with the duty of preaching to his people to make them abandon idolatry and to worship only the One Creator and to live good and pure lives. Although he preached the Message of God with immense zeal, his people refused to mend their ways, leading to his building of the Ark and the famous event of the Deluge, the Great Flood in which all the evil people of his time perished. Noah preached faith in God for 950 years according to Quran.  Noah's mission had a double character: he had to warn his people, asking them to call for repentance and, at the same time, he had to preach about God's mercy and forgiveness, promising them the glad tidings God would provide if they led righteous lives.

Thereupon, God decreed that a terrible flood would cover the whole earth and He ordered Noah to build an Ark which would save him and the believers from this dreadful calamity.[18] Ever obedient to God's instructions, Noah went out in search of material with which to build the vessel.  Exegesis narrates that, in the land where Noah lived, vegetation was scarce and so Noah had to plant trees and wait for them to grow before beginning work on the Ark. When Noah began building the Ark, the people who saw him at work laughed at him even more than before.

He called the people to serve God, and said that nobody but God could save them. He said that the time of the deluge was appointed and could not be delayed, and that the people had to submit to God.

It isn't a terrible film, as most of the audience members/cinema-goers seem to make out, but the beginning is an endurance test. However, Noah has scenes of spectacle, stunning visuals, intensity and well-acted drama, especially when they are on the ark, but it never quite meets its full potential, though the way it was made is interesting, as it lacks the full-on momentum, power, destruction and cleansing of the Flood, and it's brave of Aronofsky not to directly refer to God, as it becomes more accessible, but it lacks spirituality, it lacks heart and by the end, it leaves you feeling either refreshed, wanting to do good or a bit cold and empty and disappointed. It's received a mixed reaction and rightly so; it isn't groundbreaking, it isn't spectacular, it isn't Oscar-calibre as some may have hoped, it is somewhat disappointing, I'll further stress that it can be infuriatingly boring but it isn't terrible, it is well-directed, well-cast with Russell Crowe brilliant as the tormented, flawed but just Noah, wrestling with this domestic melodrama and psychological realism, and the beautiful Emma Watson doing a decent job of his adopted daughter (although she is no Jennifer Lawrence, I hope her career may last long, that she will become more and more versatile, that with experience, she will grow and evolve into an excellent actress/actor, which I wish upon all the young, former Harry Potter cast and that her ambition, intelligence and emotional maturity will take her all the way to an Oscar, which I particularly wish upon the Potter franchise's main three: Daniel, Emma, Rupert), and visually breathtaking.",1,0,Mark McKenzie,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.12047378547378547,2014-05-05 12:43:24,False,True

2014-05-12T07:20:21,"This movie was really disturbing.  Yes the movie was inaccurate within accordance to the bible.  With that aside the movie it's self was politically driven at every corner to promote broken family, feminism, defaming men, discrediting the story it's self.  First and foremost I found the movie disturbing concerning the baby and Cain's involvement in the film.  Making the evil fallen angels seem good never happened in any bible story.  The eating of meat; God said at the end of Noah's story that he gave the animals to man kind to be used for ""food"".  Finally the number of creatures on the Arc was inaccurate.  The bible does say a male and female, a pare of each kind, but goes further in saying; 1 pare of unclean animals, and 7 pares of clean animals.  This is to discredit the idea of eating meat since all animals would be extinct only after eating one of each kind.  So by leaving out the 7 pares of clean animals would ether discredit the bible story or give credit to the anti meat eater movement.  Furthermore we had the anti-anarchy statement of what would happen if lawlessness would take hold when men would sell their women for food.  Basically this movie was screaming; ""don't trust men; don't rely on men; don't let men be close with your baby; men are evil; ect"".  Movies like this are a perfect example of what is wrong with our society.  We should be making movies which promote family and unity.  In my opinion of this movie the writer must have had the most twisted barbaric personality disorder to conceive such a script.  The bible also states that Noah found favor in the eye's of God so God decided to save Noah, his family, and the beast.  Never did the bible say that his intentions were to make man extinct.  I nearly walked out of the movie I was so disgusted with the ill intentions of the film.  I don't mind being entertained, but if you're going to make a movie based on scripture, then you need to do so word for word; whether you agree with the word or not.  This is basically a slap in the face to all of those who do believe; promoting poverty, division, and crippling our social structure from within via this brain washing BS.",0,0,Coughtry Industrial,6qmj5mhDwJQ,-0.05459770114942528,2014-05-12 07:20:21,False,True

What do I mean? Well Zeus is a god, so is Odin, so is Marduk or even Hadad.  Mentioning the word god in a time when people worshiped many different ones in my mind would be running counter to the spirit of having a close relationship with the divine creator. Your just lumping him in with all the other gods out there. Its like every time you see your best friend and instead of saying hey Paul you just say hey friend.

I guess we please him these days so let the dancing continue. Noah only took half the animals on the Ark....the other half were in the water already so the flood just gave them more territory. The story of Biblical Noah has many earlier versions in Greek mythlogy and in Sumarian stories. The ""Epic of Gilgamesh"" is a earlier version of the flood. There is no way an Ark can contain all the animal pooh that would be excreted by the multitude of animals in 40 days unless God constipated them. It would have taken 1000 men 100 years to build an Ark to house all the animals and food for them all. If it rained enough in forty days to totally flood the earth then where did the water go and would it take 100 years to evaporate into the atmosphere causing typhoons and twisters for decades.

God had told Noah that he wanted to purge evil from the world and that it was fine for all of them to continue on living. And for those who think otherwise here's some proof, of why this is a bad adaptation of a biblical story   18 But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. 19 You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. 20 Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. 21 You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.”   9 Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. 2 The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands. 3 Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.  4 “But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it. 5 And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being.  6 “Whoever sheds human blood,     by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God     has God made mankind. 7 As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.”  8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: 9 “I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you 10 and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth. 11 I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”  Noah was kind man and I have been informed by my dad that Noah lived near people and they didn't believe him about the on coming flood. As well he had neighbors, not giant rock monster angel things, to help him in building the ark. And they were allowed to board the ark because they believed and were nice people. So all in all it was an okay movie if you were just looking for an action flick that has a little drama in it, other wise it's just a really bad adaptation of a bible story",1,1,Erica MacKenzie,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.10012626262626266,2014-06-18 17:37:59,False,True

One thing that really stands out is how well they told 2 conflicting stories regarding humans that blindly believe in God and everything he represents, and others who think that we are the masters of our destiny and no one, including creator can't do anything about that.  Yes, this movie took some liberties in storytelling and i liked it even more because of it. I mean we all know the story - why not make it interesting? I really liked Noah  - he was such a complex character( person who was so faithful that he couldn't even recognize what is right and what is wrong causing him to almost kill infants), i also liked stone giants, it was refreshing to see them and it made sense in regards of building an arc. Main villain was also good - he represented everything wrong with society but he had some valid points that made you rethink the whole flooding event.

All three sons had wives before the flood. No animals were eaten on the Ark. Noah's grandson's were born AFTER the Flood.

Just a disclaimer, I am not a hardcore catholic nor will I force my views upon you but simply tell you guys some things about Noah and things I've learned in my philosophy class.   At the time of Noah, the Earth was plagued by death, murder, and sin. God was disgusted at what his creation has become and in the trailer it said, ""if man continued in his way the the creator will annihilate the world."" God regretted his creation and decided to wipe them off the face of the Earth (God created us in His image, to be good, and to do good) but Noah found great favor in the eyes of the Lord. Noah was one who was ""blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.-genesis 5:32-10:1) and Noah was found ""righteous in this generation."" That is why Noah and his family survived the terrible storm.  We are humans. We have our high and our lows. Some of us have hit rock bottom and some of us have gone as high as happiness could take us. But religion and God exists to us because we have experienced lows that the only thing to keep us going is the belief that an all knowing diety could help us in our time of need, we call it hope. When you hit rock bottom and no one could help you, who do you ask? You say the words a lot of people say, ""God help me."" The belief that God exists and that he helps out and does all these great and wonderful things resides in us as a person. If the world was perfect, people all had the same house, the same everything and everyone had what they need and had no problems especially with feelings then God wouldn't exist because if life was perfect and we never hit the low moments then we wouldn't need God. This can be seen in various written works, my favorite is Brave New World by Aldous Huxley who was an English writer and philosopher.

So bring us what you threaten us, if you should be of the truthful."" 11:32   قَالَ إِنَّمَا يَأْتِيكُم بِهِ اللَّهُ إِن شَاءَ وَمَا أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ He said, "" Allah will only bring it to you if He wills, and you will not cause [Him] failure. 11:33   وَأُوحِيَ إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ أَنَّهُ لَن يُؤْمِنَ مِن قَوْمِكَ إِلَّا مَن قَدْ آمَنَ فَلَا تَبْتَئِسْ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ And it was revealed to Noah that, ""No one will believe from your people except those who have already believed, so do not be distressed by what they have been doing. 11:36   وَاصْنَعِ الْفُلْكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا وَوَحْيِنَا وَلَا تُخَاطِبْنِي فِي الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا ۚ إِنَّهُم مُّغْرَقُونَ And construct the ship under Our observation and Our inspiration and do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are [to be] drowned."" 11:37   وَيَصْنَعُ الْفُلْكَ وَكُلَّمَا مَرَّ عَلَيْهِ مَلَأٌ مِّن قَوْمِهِ سَخِرُوا مِنْهُ ۚ قَالَ إِن تَسْخَرُوا مِنَّا فَإِنَّا نَسْخَرُ مِنكُمْ كَمَا تَسْخَرُونَ And he constructed the ship, and whenever an assembly of the eminent of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, ""If you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule. 11:38   حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَ أَمْرُنَا وَفَارَ التَّنُّورُ قُلْنَا احْمِلْ فِيهَا مِن كُلٍّ زَوْجَيْنِ اثْنَيْنِ وَأَهْلَكَ إِلَّا مَن سَبَقَ عَلَيْهِ الْقَوْلُ وَمَنْ آمَنَ ۚ وَمَا آمَنَ مَعَهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ [So it was], until when Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, ""Load upon the ship of each [creature] two mates and your family, except those about whom the word has preceded, and [include] whoever has believed."" But none had believed with him, except a few. 11:40   وَقَالَ ارْكَبُوا فِيهَا بِسْمِ اللَّهِ مَجْرَاهَا وَمُرْسَاهَا ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ And [Noah] said, ""Embark therein; in the name of Allah is its course and its anchorage. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."" 11:41   وَهِيَ تَجْرِي بِهِمْ فِي مَوْجٍ كَالْجِبَالِ وَنَادَىٰ نُوحٌ ابْنَهُ وَكَانَ فِي مَعْزِلٍ يَا بُنَيَّ ارْكَب مَّعَنَا وَلَا تَكُن مَّعَ الْكَافِرِينَ And it sailed with them through waves like mountains, and Noah called to his son who was apart [from them], ""O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers."" 11:42   قَالَ سَآوِي إِلَىٰ جَبَلٍ يَعْصِمُنِي مِنَ الْمَاءِ ۚ قَالَ لَا عَاصِمَ الْيَوْمَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ إِلَّا مَن رَّحِمَ ۚ وَحَالَ بَيْنَهُمَا الْمَوْجُ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُغْرَقِينَ [But] he said, ""I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water."" [Noah] said, ""There is no protector today from the decree of Allah , except for whom He gives mercy."" And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned. 11:43   وَقِيلَ يَا أَرْضُ ابْلَعِي مَاءَكِ وَيَا سَمَاءُ أَقْلِعِي وَغِيضَ الْمَاءُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ وَاسْتَوَتْ عَلَى الْجُودِيِّ ۖ وَقِيلَ بُعْدًا لِّلْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ And it was said, ""O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, withhold [your rain]."" And the water subsided, and the matter was accomplished, and the ship came to rest on the [mountain of] Judiyy. And it was said, ""Away with the wrongdoing people."" 11:44   وَنَادَىٰ نُوحٌ رَّبَّهُ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنَّ ابْنِي مِنْ أَهْلِي وَإِنَّ وَعْدَكَ الْحَقُّ وَأَنتَ أَحْكَمُ الْحَاكِمِينَ And Noah called to his Lord and said, ""My Lord, indeed my son is of my family; and indeed, Your promise is true; and You are the most just of judges!"" 11:45   قَالَ يَا نُوحُ إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ ۖ إِنَّهُ عَمَلٌ غَيْرُ صَالِحٍ ۖ فَلَا تَسْأَلْنِ مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ ۖ إِنِّي أَعِظُكَ أَن تَكُونَ مِنَ الْجَاهِلِينَ He said, ""O Noah, indeed he is not of your family; indeed, he is [one whose] work was other than righteous, so ask Me not for that about which you have no knowledge. Indeed, I advise you, lest you be among the ignorant."" 11:46   قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ أَنْ أَسْأَلَكَ مَا لَيْسَ لِي بِهِ عِلْمٌ ۖ وَإِلَّا تَغْفِرْ لِي وَتَرْحَمْنِي أَكُن مِّنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ [Noah] said, ""My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers."" 11: 47   قِيلَ يَا نُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَامٍ مِّنَّا وَبَرَكَاتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰ أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ ۚ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُم مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ It was said, ""O Noah, disembark in security from Us and blessings upon you and upon nations [descending] from those with you. But other nations [of them] We will grant enjoyment; then there will touch them from Us a painful punishment."" 11:48   تِلْكَ مِنْ أَنبَاءِ الْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهَا إِلَيْكَ ۖ مَا كُنتَ تَعْلَمُهَا أَنتَ وَلَا قَوْمُكَ مِن قَبْلِ هَٰذَا ۖ فَاصْبِرْ ۖ إِنَّ الْعَاقِبَةَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Muhammad].

Communities that live and thrive in harmony and with responsibility.  Peaceful communities that are built upon foundation of : love, spirituality, mercy, generosity, tolerance, intelligent, and wisdom. If you are interested in becoming a part of this grass root efforts, We encourage your reply.  This Community ARK Project is looking for peaceful, patience, humble, and kind-hearted people who are awaken and aware of the coming environmental collapse; who want to roll up their sleeves and participate in preparatory efforts. One cannot pull someone out of a raging river standing on a muddy slippery slope. In order to pull someone out of the river, one must stand on a firm solid foundation. A fully self-sufficient community is that solid foundation, upon which we stand in order to rescue other less fortunate who will be affected by the collapsing environment.  If people are struggling to survive as the environment collapses, how can they help others?  People need fully self-sufficient communities to shelter and nourish them, in order for them to reach out and help others.  We are gathering people from all spectrum of professional background: engineers, scientists, architects, biologists, farmers, doctors, nurses, artists, etc. Both skilled and unskilled people. Those with knowledge will teach those who lack them. Those not in the know will listen and learn so they might in turn teach others in the community. We have spent 6 years researching technology that were designed to allow Mars colonies to thrive in a desolate environment. We are now planning on using those very same technology to prepare people for the coming environmental collapse. If you are interested in helping out, we could use the help to reach the ears of people who are awaken through social media, or you can read our blog titled ""Generalized Plan of Actions"" for a list of tasks you can volunteer for.  (Note: this is a gathering process and NOT a recruitment process. When one recruit, one is trying to convince others to join a cause; well, someone else can always come along and convince people to join a different cause. But when one gather, one is speaking to those of like mind who do not need convincing; in their hearts and in their thoughts, they recognize the catastrophe that lay ahead if our modern societies continue on their current path of promoting competition, strife, ignorance and scarcity. This Community ARK Project is lighting a beacon so that those with similar mind set will know that they are not alone in their thoughts and impulses; that there are others like them out there who desire to come together to pool our effort in order to EXTRACT ourselves and place ourselves on a different path.  One that promote cooperation, harmony, foresight, and a nurturing environment.)",2,0,Community ARK Project,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.15278679653679655,2015-07-31 06:48:07,False,False

All species and people became corrupt through the fallen angles, that's where the giants came from. Just as the days of Noah, it will be in the end times (as Jesus states). They will return to deceive the most elect if possible, if you're not aware, the Aliens that are to come, will not be extra terrestrial, they will be extra dimensional. God said Noah and his family were the only pure ones left, not because they were perfect in God's commandments, Jesus was and is the only one ever who has and will be that EVER, but they were pure because they weren't corrupted by the fallen angles. Don't be fooled into thinking God is evil because of the people that were destroyed in that flood, that weren't human at that point for breeding with the shapeshifting fallen angles that took over in those generations, corrupting all of God's creations through shapeshifting into the sex/creature they needed to be to make the breeding work, even through cross species as well. These fallen angles have these powers don't be mistaken, scripture tells us that they are able to shapeshift. God is good as well, let no man deceive you. Watch Steve Quayle for more information on these topics, Brothers and Sisters you need to know the truth, don't perish for lack of knowledge, it's the entertainment industries goal for this to happen (Hollywood) see past the lies, don't be a part of their demise. This can seem crazy to you but that's because we have grown up believing it is only fantasy, please look into it and do your research before you decide it's 'way out of line' this information is extremely critical. Blessings and much love in Christ.",0,0,Team Jesus,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.09814285714285714,2015-10-07 23:08:50,False,False

(So it was) till then there came Our Command and the oven gushed forth (water like fountains from the earth). We said: ""Embark therein, of each kind two (male and female), and your family, except him against whom the Word has already gone forth, and those who believe. And none believed with him, except a few.""  41. And he [Nuh (Noah)] said: ""Embark therein, in the Name of Allah will be its moving course and its resting anchorage. Surely, my Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.  42. So it (the ship) sailed with them amidst the waves like mountains, and Nuh (Noah) called out to his son, who had separated himself (apart), ""O my son! Embark with us and be not with the disbelievers.""  43. The son replied: ""I will betake myself to a mountain, it will save me from the water."" Nuh (Noah) said: ""This day there is no saviour from the Decree of Allah except him on whom He has mercy."" And a wave came in between them, so he (the son) was among the drowned.  44. And it was said: ""O earth! Swallow up your water, and O sky! Withhold (your rain)."" And the water was diminished (made to subside) and the Decree (of Allah) was fulfilled (i.e. the destruction of the people of Nuh (Noah). And it (the ship) rested on Mount Judi, and it was said: ""Away with the people who are Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doing)!""  45. And Nuh (Noah) called upon his Lord and said, ""O my Lord! Verily, my son is of my family! And certainly, Your Promise is true, and You are the Most Just of the judges.""  46. He said: ""O Nuh (Noah)! Surely, he is not of your family; verily, his work is unrighteous, so ask not of Me that of which you have no knowledge! I admonish you, lest you be one of the ignorants.""  47. Nuh (Noah) said: ""O my Lord! I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers.""  48. It was said: ""O Nuh (Noah)! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you (and on some of their off spring), but (there will be other) people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.""",61,16,wat it do,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.0581134927929505,2016-02-18 03:21:58,False,False

2016-07-26T13:49:23,"So when Hollywood is out of ideas, they start making fictions from fictions itself. The one thing that stupefied me from that Biblical Noah story was this: Ham disrespected his father Noah when Noah was asleep but Noah punished Ham son, Canaan, instead of Ham. Huh? Does that even make sense? It is either Noah, on waking up, was still dizzy from the wine that crashed him or Noah was a straight up moron. In my estimation, if I must take that biblical Noah story as facts of history, Ham son, Canaan was cursed because Canaan was the produce of a sexual encounter that happened between Ham and Ham's mother (Yes Noah wife). We understand through research that seeing a man nakedness as referred to by many ancient culture (and even some cultures in todays world) is mating with the man's wife. Except Ham sodomised his father and this is unlikely because it makes absolutely no sense to purnish a grand son that is not directly or indirectly connected to his father misdeed. And the Bible saying Canaan was punished by his grand father because his father simply only just saw his grand father sleeping naked is just too illogical. That part of the Bible like many other Bible parts just make the Bible a straight up fiction book. And the Bible having all these nonsensical stories just means two things. It is either the Bible like other religious books are a fabrication of history or the Bible and other religious books stories somewhere in history was altered.

He was one of the 'ulul atham' one of five prophets known to have great determination. And great determination indeed, he had to be patient with his people for 900 years. Who can preach for an hour let alone 900 years for the benefit of his people? The flood was the response of his prayer when no one would believe. His son was separated by a wave and drowned as he chose not to board the ark, he did not believe in the message of his father. Neither did the wife of Noah and she is also mentioned as a disbeliever despite having the best husband. He wasn't commanded to kill his granddaughter, and he was a great human being, we are all of his progeny and as a result of his efforts. May peace be upon Noah (as) and all the prophets ameen.

The water that flooded the world did also come from beneath(fountains of the great deep) All of the animals fit perfectly in the ark.  Animals were vegetarian.  Humans were vegetarian, at least those that listened to God. Animals were not as afraid of humans back then because of the above points.   THINGS THE MOVIE GOT WRONG: God had Noah invite all the populace on the ark. (everyone laughed)  Noahs sons already had wives before entering the ark.  The angelic beings actually mingled with the seed of humans, they were not and could not be of stone.  The angelic beings did not come down to earth to help humans, but because they were tempted by the women on earth.       (Which is why God had to destroy the world!) God actually wanted to restart the human population, not against it.   IF YOU READ THE BIBLE, MAINLY THE ACCOUNT OF GENESIS, YOU WILL KNOW THE ABOVE TO BE TRUE.

2018-09-10T05:08:27,"Daniel 7 New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) Visions of the Four Beasts 7 In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in bed. Then he wrote down the dream:[a] 2 I,[b] Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea, 3 and four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. 4 The first was like a lion and had eagles’ wings. Then, as I watched, its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a human being; and a human mind was given to it. 5 Another beast appeared, a second one, that looked like a bear. It was raised up on one side, had three tusks[c] in its mouth among its teeth and was told, “Arise, devour many bodies!” 6 After this, as I watched, another appeared, like a leopard. The beast had four wings of a bird on its back and four heads; and dominion was given to it. 7 After this I saw in the visions by night a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth and was devouring, breaking in pieces, and stamping what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that preceded it, and it had ten horns. 8 I was considering the horns, when another horn appeared, a little one coming up among them; to make room for it, three of the earlier horns were plucked up by the roots. There were eyes like human eyes in this horn, and a mouth speaking arrogantly.  Judgment before the Ancient One 9 As I watched, thrones were set in place,     and an Ancient One[d] took his throne, his clothing was white as snow,     and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames,     and its wheels were burning fire. 10 A stream of fire issued     and flowed out from his presence. A thousand thousands served him,     and ten thousand times ten thousand stood attending him. The court sat in judgment,     and the books were opened.  11 I watched then because of the noise of the arrogant words that the horn was speaking. And as I watched, the beast was put to death, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. 12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. 13 As I watched in the night visions,  I saw one like a human being[e]     coming with the clouds of heaven. And he came to the Ancient One[f]     and was presented before him. 14 To him was given dominion     and glory and kingship, that all peoples, nations, and languages     should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion     that shall not pass away, and his kingship is one     that shall never be destroyed.  Daniel’s Visions Interpreted 15 As for me, Daniel, my spirit was troubled within me,[g] and the visions of my head terrified me. 16 I approached one of the attendants to ask him the truth concerning all this. So he said that he would disclose to me the interpretation of the matter: 17 “As for these four great beasts, four kings shall arise out of the earth. 18 But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever—forever and ever.”  19 Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet; 20 and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and concerning the other horn, which came up and to make room for which three of them fell out—the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke arrogantly, and that seemed greater than the others. 21 As I looked, this horn made war with the holy ones and was prevailing over them, 22 until the Ancient One[h] came; then judgment was given for the holy ones of the Most High, and the time arrived when the holy ones gained possession of the kingdom.  23 This is what he said: “As for the fourth beast,  there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth     that shall be different from all the other kingdoms; it shall devour the whole earth,     and trample it down, and break it to pieces. 24 As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise,     and another shall arise after them. This one shall be different from the former ones,     and shall put down three kings. 25 He shall speak words against the Most High,     shall wear out the holy ones of the Most High,     and shall attempt to change the sacred seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his power     for a time, two times,[i] and half a time. 26 Then the court shall sit in judgment,     and his dominion shall be taken away,     to be consumed and totally destroyed. 27 The kingship and dominion     and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven     shall be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High; their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom,     and all dominions shall serve and obey them.”  28 Here the account ends. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly terrified me, and my face turned pale; but I kept the matter in my mind.",1,0,Noahide,6qmj5mhDwJQ,0.08325233360389611,2018-09-10 05:08:27,False,False

2020-03-14T03:53:10,"Argument is logical if there is someone believe in Noah as he was in this movie.  This movie is an excuse for the nonbelievers people such as atheists or agnostics to laugh at us :))  By the way the true story as we believe in Islam is more more logical.  We believe in Noah as a prophet of god (not a normal religious man)   We believe he has 3 survived son, Noah doesn’t take just his family, there were some believers in the Ark with him.  Noah invited his wife and his fourth son when the flood and rain started but they didn’t obey him, his son said:  (I will betake myself to some mountain, it will save me from the water)  Because his son and his wife weren’t a believers.  And there are a lot of mistakes but i can’t mention them all.  Please read the story from Islam sources especially the Quran and the Sunnah and compare.
