Even if they never did anything wrong to us, we'd be so vulnerable to the smallest mistakes/accidents.  3. It MEANS something to be human, this would be like shedding your humanity. Not worth it.

I kept wondering where all the blackbirds were when you need one...or perhaps a pebble tumbling off the cliff to come crashing into that guys micro-yacht. What should have been terrifying was more like a dark cloud hanging over your head the  entire move that never rains destruction or chaos. I mean, what about earthquakes? jeez. What about what all those little people could be doing on the outside. Too focused on a storyline, and grant you it was okay, almost good, but truly missing something that would have made it great since this is the first time any movie like this has been made except for innerspace and honey I shrunk the kids (neither had anything to do with a society of tiny people though). Some things are better left to god. Too much misery means no room for fun. Nor did they explore the scientific fact that physics changes when you're small... bugs for example can carry many times their own weight. Then there's the big problem with voices!

What was the point of changing that for the trailer? Also, when you see him stuck in a cubicle on the phone, the trailer makes it look like he's tired of his life and he should go get small. He gets the cubicle job AFTER he gets small. That shot is taken after he's already downsized. Also Kristin Wiig is in the movie for about 15 minutes while the movie is over 2 hours long. Also, the Vietnamese lady they briefly show for a split second at 1:55 is pretty much the main character. She has the most screen time and the most dialogue, while you can barely understand what she's saying the whole time. Jason Sudekis's appearance in this film can be considered a cameo at best. Also, that huge Absolut bottle scene is not in the movie. My point is, this is a very deceptive trailer. The movie isn't nearly as good as the trailer makes it look. The movie is more about the Vietnamese lady with a thick fake annoying accent trying to get a new foot prosthesis and bringing people food in her ghetto neighborhood, and less about Matt Damon's adjustments to this new small life.",1,0,Jubach,0Md0XJZlbAk,0.08235930735930737,2018-12-12 15:21:12,False,False
