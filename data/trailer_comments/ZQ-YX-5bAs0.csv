In those cases, these communities almost never get to see themselves represented in big budget blockbusters anywhere in the world.   China meanwhile is almost about to overtake America as the largest film market in the world, they have plenty of home made blockbusters coming out every year that end up in the top 20-30 highest grossing movies worldwide. Japan has a thriving anime industry among other things. Hollywood has been emulating Korean action movies for years and India has the largest film industry in the world. So Asians see themselves represented on a regular basis on big screens and that is probably the reason why it took so long for Hollywood to make a movie exclusively about Asians because the appetites of the American asians were already being somewhat whetted.",0,0,Dr. Kaustav Nayak,ZQ-YX-5bAs0,0.10029761904761905,2018-04-23 19:57:21,True,True

2018-04-24T02:04:48,"I know there‚Äôs a lot of people wondering why Asian-Americans are so excited for this movie when there‚Äôs a myriad variety of Korean/Chinese dramas and movies already existing. But the thing is, Asians and Asian-Americans are two vastly different populations with incredibly different cultures. Asians, people who live/grew up in Asia, have no problem finding representations of themselves in the media, whereas Asian-Americans see little to no representation of ourselves in American/Western media, our own countries. Asian-Americans have gravitated to Asian medias like anime, dramas, and kpop because, growing up, those were the only outlets we had seeing people who look like us being main characters in lead roles and music groups. It is part of our background, but it is still not quite us. The difference is that Asian-Americans grew up starved for true representation of themselves reflecting in the medias of their birth country.   Instead, we grew up watching crude caricatures of ourselves, if we were ever reflected in Western media at all. They were roles written by people who didn‚Äôt and will never know what it‚Äôs like to be Asian or a POC. They were roles that lacked depth, creativity, and accuracy; simply existing to support a white lead character or to feign diversity.   When it comes to whitewashing roles, Asians, like the Japanese, tend to be more okay with cultural appropriation, like white people playing Asian roles, because they are represented in their country‚Äôs media all the time, so appropriation doesn‚Äôt seem as much of a big deal to them. However, Asian-Americans don‚Äôt have this same luxury. What we get at best is a quirky side character every once in while who has to exhibit some form of tired stereotype. I can‚Äôt stress how incredibly unfair it is to be mocked for liking Asian stuff growing up (like anime etc.) and then as soon as it trends worldwide and is profitable, Western medias find a way to stick a white lead actor/actress into its remake somehow, when it would have been a clear opportunity for an Asian-American actor/actress to shine and represent the culture they came from. That is the reason why we want this, why we need more movies like this. I know that this movie has its flaws. Its representation does not reach the spectrum of diversity displayed in the book, but it‚Äôs a start. It‚Äôs a start we can build on and, therefore, a huge win for Asian representation in America and other Western countries!",0,0,Stressed Out Azim,ZQ-YX-5bAs0,0.09664351851851853,2018-04-24 02:04:48,True,True

I bet the plot of this movie will be...oh basic Asian girl falls in love with this Asian guy.... as we know he turns out to be a rich man and his family doesn't like her because she's not rich...cliche old Asian grandma doesn't want the Asian dude marrying a commoner... that one friend of the main Asian protagonist is the comic relief... then the plot kicks in...Oh someone is trying to scandal the family money oh nooo! They think it's the girl and the Asian guy and her are now separated....WHOA the girl and her friend become secret agents and suddenly find out the guy stealing money... boom all is forgiven and grandmama forgives and gives her blessing.

Sure, it's great to have a predominately Asian cast for a revolutionary film, but wasn't the whole point that Asian people needed more representation in ""regular"" roles in media?

I guess, if you call having a rich family abroad ""regular problems.""

This movie appeals to a very confine group of people, young female Asian American and SJW. The target audience is small, Asian American accounts for around 5% of total American population. On top of that it's a rom com, which to be honest generally doesn't appeal to male and older audience, asian or not. So the target audience gets cut by half again, which leaves us young female asian. If we strip all these ethnicity stuff from this movie, it just a bland generic rich guy poor girl rom com, which I doubt even rom com fan would found it interesting.  One might argue Asian accounts for the most population in the globe, this movie actually has a huge audience. However, Asian living in Asia (like me) and first generation Asian American don't like these pseudo Asian movies, we like actual Asian movie made in our home country, may it be Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or even Indian. Pseudo Asian movies don't relate to us, to us this is an American movie without the exotic white and black people. Heck, they claim to be Singaporean but nobody in this trailer speak with a Singaporean accent.  This will not be the Black Panther of Asian. Black Panther was a success because it's a marvel studio superhero movie.

2018-04-24T17:04:07,Singapore is nothing but wannabe yellow people pretends to be white. I mean they used to beg Malaysia even for water. Their elections are a scam. They publicise their political system as democracy but the ground reality is that only one family wins every election. Their milatary is non existent. The only reason they are rich is because of the port which in turn is a cause of increased exports of China and Japan to Western nations. They are getting a lot of Marine traffic which is primary source of their wealth. There are no natural resources in that country. It's just a infrastructure bubble fuelled by brokerage money.,0,0,Srinivas Kns,ZQ-YX-5bAs0,0.06477272727272726,2018-04-24 17:04:07,True,True

Constance is such a good actress but she just doesnt resemble Rachel Chu as how she is described in the book AT ALL! Rachel chu appearance was described as an asian beauty, laidback, proffesional and composed. A woman with persona. While in here all i see is a mid 30s woman acting like a jumpy, wide-eyed, hyper teenage girl. HELL! She is supposed to be a university profesor and doesnt have that persona at all. Not to mention that constance is not as easy in the eyes as how Rachel chu should look based on the book. SECOND the nick young! Oh no no no!!! Again! In the book hes like 100%chinese! Pure chinese! But this actor gosh He looks like a MIX! Its so out of the picture! I was imagining someone like DANIEL WU you know... the young daniel wu. Gorgeous, sexy handsome and smart looking Chinese.

I get it, this is the trailer - but I hope they retain some more of the cultural insights, language, and references the book actually makes or else - this is nothing but a white-washed version of the book and does nothing but water down Asian culture for the sake of making it more relatable. #GiveMeSinglishPls",0,0,Amateur Atelier,ZQ-YX-5bAs0,0.12103174603174603,2018-04-24 22:53:41,True,True

2018-04-25T09:01:49,"Belief and Unbelief FW 17 How much do we believe from the heart? Draw nigh to God, and God will draw nigh to you. This means to be much with the Lord in prayer. When those who have educated themselves in skepticism and have cherished unbelief, weaving questioning doubts into their experience, are under conviction of the Spirit of God, they see it to be their personal duty to confess their unbelief. They open their hearts to accept the light sent them and throw themselves by faith over the line from sin to righteousness, from doubt to faith. They consecrate themselves unreservedly to God, to follow His light in the place of the sparks of their own kindling. As they maintain their consecration, they will see increased light and the light will continue to grow brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. FW 17.1 The unbelief which is cherished in the soul has a bewitching power. The seeds of doubt that they have been sowing will produce their harvest but they must continue to dig up every root of unbelief. When these poisonous plants are pulled up, they cease to grow for want of nourishment in word and action. The soul must have the precious plants of faith and love put in the soil of the heart and enthroned there.

The main selling point of this movie may not be the extravagant wedding St Andrew's Cathedral or the multiple angle shots of Glamorous Marina Bay Sand and the Esplanade. Moreover, it is those subtle details like coming from a Peranakan-Chinese background family infusing abit of Malay-culture into it, using Wok instead normal frying pans, going to well-preserved heritage Shophouse back in the 1970s. It may feel Posh and yet they are adding a little bit of retro- element into this movie which is a massive thumb up for me. They even filmed at the cast dining at the Famous Newton Hawker Center. Not many Westerners being exposed to that. Like what Gordon Ramsay had once said, if you come to Singapore, the best food is from the Hawker Center.

I am not going to read a book or see a movie just because there is an all Asian cast if it does not appeal to me or if I cannot relate to a character or characters. But I am glad to there are more Asian faces in films and it would be nice fpr.the movie to do well.

Never mind that it looks like shit, the characters are portrayed very superficially, and that these are the most American speaking/acting asians I've ever seen, the QUOTA has been filled.  All Hollywood needed to do was make a movie with a bunch of asians and voila, now everyone knows they're not racist.  *Biggest longest eye roll in the world*  Does no one care about quality anymore?  This was clearly not made with any profound passion, but a desire to pander to demographics and make a quick buck...like every other movie being made these days.  Oh but there's a lot of asians in it, so that makes it good.  There's never enough diversity in movies, right?  How dare a predominantly white country have a predominantly white cast?  America should take after China, they make movies with mostly white people all the time.  Speaking of, I wonder how China will react to this Baizuo movie.

And who cares whether there are other races or not, it's their fucking story. If you want, go make your own movie with all races. Is P.Ramlee racist for not putting other races in his story even when there are other races?? Is Jack Neo racist for lack of racial variety in his movies?? I mean, it's really up to them AS LONG AS they don't stereotypes our ethnicity or culture as a negative one or claim Indian or Malay culture as theirs in the name of being ""Singaporean"". Well, knowing sensitive blockheads in Singapore, even if you have other races, you might still get bashed for cultural appropriation. Don't like don't support loh. But I would never agree using that movie as a representation for the asians let alone the South East ones and by that comparing to Black Panther wouldn't make sense. Most of the cast are black bc they have to, if Black Panther casts was white, you guys have nothing to be proud of lel sad huh. Every movie have context and roles to play.

Kevin Kwan is incredibly perceptive and reveals many insider details on the lives of wealthy Asians because he himself grew up around similar types of people, studying in a private elite school in Singapore. Kwan understands the discrepancies between the various Asian cultures that exist and illustrates this through the treatment of Rachel Chu, who originates from mainland China, by rich Singaporean elites. On a side note, does Rachel and Nick remind anyone else of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle? Hauntingly similar things kept on appearing as I was reading and it's almost as if Kevin Kwan prophesied the royal wedding just a few years after the book release (e.g. Meghan Markle's real name is Rachel, both Meghan and Rachel are ostracized for being American, both couples met through a mutual friend etc.).",0,0,Flora M.,ZQ-YX-5bAs0,0.16176470588235295,2018-06-12 14:25:25,True,True

My Grandpa is full Taiwanese and his story is much more interesting then movie this trailer may produce.

There are no different races, there is only one race, the human race, and it is composed by half-breeds (like me), Asians, Whites, Blacks, etc. Can't we just accept the fact that we are all humans and stop separating each other with that concept of 'race'?

2018-08-23T21:55:42,"Great article analyzing the mahjong scene from Vox website (Spoiler alert if you have not seen the movie, and you should). Vulture site also has another good write up explaining the fine points many would miss.   ""What the climactic mahjong scene means In the movie, the mahjong scene takes place in a pivotal scene after our protagonist Rachel Chu, played by Constance Wu, has been rejected by her boyfriend Nick‚Äôs mother, Eleanor (played by Michelle Yeoh). This is because Eleanor learns that Rachel was born to a single mother who fled China for the States. However, unbeknownst to Eleanor, Nick has gone against his mother‚Äôs wishes and proposed to Rachel anyway.  In the mahjong scene, Rachel and Eleanor go head to head right after this stunning twist. Rachel invites Eleanor to meet with her at a mahjong parlor ‚Äî a gambling house frequented mostly by working- or middle-class older folks who rent tables by the hour. The persistent clacking of tiles is a sound familiar to anyone who has been around people playing mahjong.  When Eleanor arrives, she takes the open seat across from Rachel and is offered the role of dealer ‚Äî the ‚ÄúEast‚Äù seat. The four seats in mahjong are named after the compass directions, which plays an important role both in the rules of the game and in the symbolism of the scene. Eleanor, in the role of the ‚ÄúEast,‚Äù representing Asia, is the player in control. Rachel, sitting across from her, represents America ‚Äî the ‚ÄúWest.‚Äù  Early in the scene, Eleanor completes a ‚Äúpong,‚Äù or a matched set of tiles. This move demonstrates that Eleanor plans to win using the strategy of matched tiles, and she‚Äôs making Rachel aware. In this moment, Eleanor tells Rachel that her mother taught her how to play too.  As the conversation continues, Rachel asks Eleanor why she didn‚Äôt like her from the very beginning ‚Äî even before her family history was revealed. Eleanor expounds on the difference between Asians and Americans, noting how even though Asian Americans look Asian, they are American at heart. Referencing a Hokkien term that means ‚Äúour kind of people,‚Äù she says that Asian Americans are not kaki lang. Remember, in this game, Eleanor is trying to create a winning hand comprising all matches of the same exact tile ‚Äî an ‚Äúextended family‚Äù that‚Äôs metaphorically composed of kaki lang.  The camera then cuts to show a number of discarded bamboo tiles. Discarded bamboo calls to mind a frequently used term for Westernized overseas Asians, this one Cantonese: jook sing, which literally means ‚Äúempty bamboo.‚Äù It‚Äôs a slang term that‚Äôs the Chinese equivalent of the Asian-American term ‚Äúbanana‚Äù ‚Äî yellow on the outside, white on the inside ‚Äî cited earlier in the film by Peik Lin (the frenetically hilarious Awkwafina). The ‚Äúempty‚Äù bamboo tiles are scattered alongside the tiles for East and West, not truly part of either, representing Eleanor‚Äôs perception of Rachel.  At this point, Rachel drops the bomb on Eleanor that Nick proposed to her, telling her that he said he‚Äôd be willing to walk away from everything ‚Äî his family, his family‚Äôs wealth ‚Äî to be with her. Right as Rachel is saying this, she draws the most important tile in the game: an eight of bamboo.  The number eight is of huge symbolic importance to the Chinese; it resembles the character for fortune and is considered a sign of wealth, prosperity, and happiness. It‚Äôs why so many Chinese license plates, phone numbers, and even street addresses contain eights. Monterey Park, the first city in San Gabriel Valley, California, to become a suburban destination for wealthy Chinese, was considered a particularly propitious place to live because it had an 818 area code.  While an eight doesn‚Äôt have special value in the game of mahjong, we see that the eight of bamboo is also the one tile Rachel needs to complete her hand. This is a winning tile for her. But Rachel knows something else, based on her observation of how the game has played out (remember, she‚Äôs a game theory professor!): It‚Äôs Eleanor‚Äôs winning tile too.  She then discloses to Eleanor that she turned Nick down. Eleanor is dumbfounded. ‚ÄúOnly a fool folds a winning hand,‚Äù she says, referring to Nick‚Äôs proposal.  This is critical, because in the very first scene of the movie, Rachel demonstrated through a poker game with one of her TAs that to be successful in any game where psychology and choice are a factor, you can‚Äôt play ‚Äúnot to lose‚Äù ‚Äî you have to play to win.  Rachel explains: When it comes to her marriage with Nick, Eleanor has guaranteed there‚Äôs no winning outcome for them. Nick choosing Rachel means he‚Äôd lose his mother and his family. Nick choosing his family means he might resent Eleanor forever ‚Äî thus losing his mother anyway. Lose-lose.  So she decided to seize control of the situation and choose for him. But she doesn‚Äôt want it to happen without Eleanor knowing exactly why it‚Äôs happening and what Rachel is giving up to make it possible.  She tells Eleanor that she knows Nick will eventually find someone else, someone that his family approves of ‚Äî that‚Äôs what every generation of Youngs has done before him, after all. And while her own heart will be broken, as she says, she loves him so much that she is willing to suffer if it means that Nick will keep the thing that is at the heart of Asian culture, and of his story: his family.  That‚Äôs when Rachel throws out the eight of bamboo as a discard ‚Äî folding her winning hand, knowing that Eleanor will pick it up and declare victory. While this happens, she explains that when Nick finds the proper match in the future, she wants Eleanor to understand that the only reason it occurred was because a ‚Äúpoor, raised by a single mother, low-class immigrant nobody‚Äù ‚Äî Rachel ‚Äî made it possible.  She then reveals her hand, which would have won, making it clear to the whole table what she‚Äôs done, and walks away.  In this move, Rachel has demonstrated to Eleanor three critical things. The first is that she loves Nick enough to put his future ahead of hers. The second is that she understands that family should always come first, something that Eleanor suspected she didn‚Äôt comprehend as a jook sing Asian American. And the third is that Rachel is strong, self-sacrificing, and courageous ‚Äî a lot like Eleanor herself. Instead of ‚Äúnever being enough‚Äù for Nick, a line Eleanor uses to surgically destroy Rachel in an earlier scene, she‚Äôs most likely exactly what Nick needs.  Knowing all of this context isn‚Äôt necessary for the scene to work, but it certainly adds depth to understand the symbolism of the game.  This essay was adapted from a post on Angry Asian Man.

Yeah, it's a shitty mentality but that's what it is.  The key to shrug off parental influence is to be your own person. I know a lot of Asian kids who had to listen to every word their parents spew off mostly because they. are. not. independent. When your parents pays for your house and your car, you are damn sure to listen to them.  So if you want to find true love (not some random girl your parents like), first you have to find your own success; aka make your own money, carve out your own piece of the world with your own hands. That way, you don't need to listen to anyone or kaotow to anyone not even your loving parents.  As much as I love my parents, I have dated girls from every background and they have very little say in what happens. After a while, they just started to accept it.

Yes it can be considered a chick flick, but if certain parts are done right ,like the music is in the wedding scene , then it becomes all inclusive. BTW, the wedding scene was right up their with Mamma Mia's HWGA Dancing Queen scene. Very impressed with Jon M.Chu work here .  Just a little FYI , if you're at an Asian function and the reply to your question "" What does it taste like "" ? is taste like hot dog , don't bite at the chance just to be cool and fit in, cause it doesn't .  Also, when you ask what's the special soup of the day, and the cook tells you to open the pot , don't ! Especially if you don't want to look at a bunch of chicken feet. I used to work at a restaurant called Frankies Chinese Steak House, and they got their fair share of giggles after I opened those pots and pans . Top notch food though everyone . Seriously . Lobster sauce was from lobster. Peking Duck crispy damn delicious. Real, not frozen stuff. Today most all restaurants won't deal with raw shimp etc, unless you live by the coasts, and them some places still won't .  Teriyaki on a stick , daaamnnnnnnnn . Jes holy moses good. I used to help them make it. Peppers & Steak , wow . Everything every morning done fresh. I was 18/19 years old and doing a job as a bar back/bus boy and I was walking out the door on Fridays with $200 to $300, a night. The reason being , it was Frankies. They worked hard, that's the reason for their success. Just bust ass hard workers. That's the real reason for all their great grades too, they bust ass. You don't go back home with bad grades.  I knew this one Asian girl in college. She was from China.  She had straight A's. She had to make sure everything was completed even before she would ever consider going out. It kinda drove me nuts at times , but she pleaded with me to respect her wishes, and not ask till everything was done. I did.  She moved back to China. I still have some of the letters we shared from all those years ago. Wow, Crazy Rich Asian kinda affected me more than I thought it did.  Regarding the rich. *New found tend to be apologetic* .  I was supposed to go to NYC for the 4th, but my friend took us elsewhere . We ended up at the top side of a mountain that overlooked the city from afar. What was on the top was a house  that was built at the edge of the cliff of that mountain. Literally , it was built into the rock top/side.  If you went to the edge of the outside deck, the outside deck was the plot of most average house, that comments just for scale, you could look straight down the cliff. Well those people who owned that were the apologizing kind . *Old money, well the gardener drinks from the garden hose* .  Regardless of my old ass ramblings ,  you'll laugh and love with Crazy Rich Asians . Certainly worth a repeat viewing, especially the wedding scene .",1,4,Johmathan .B.

I typically see movies once, a few twice at most (rarely) because I feel the movies are milestones or I just love it and/or the actors in it, and this movie I‚Äôm seeing 4x because it‚Äôs a rare milestone and that needs to change and be more prevalent and I want a sequel for sure!!!

It was a cookie cutter version of a zillion other big-screen love stories except with a predominantly Asian cast with a lot of western (typical whether they want to admit it or not) influence.  Because there is now  a fast-growing  influx of Asians in the U.S. trying to buy up anything and everything tied to wealth and status in America including real estate, Disneyland, universities and a bunch of other stuff no one told them was for sell  (although US citizen will never be allowed to do the same in their country unless you are some 5th generation Asian or something that truly defines ""Crazy Rich Asians), this movie with the caucasian butler in the background and the the white guys losing their jobs immediately at the beginning of the movie was one of those ""Ok you've made your point.""  moments. You could also immediately tell that there was some Chinese person with cash sponsoring this on American big screen with a ""Hey look at us, we're here too and want to be noticed."" intentions.  This just seemed like something better-suited playing at some local theater in Shanghai or Beijing.  The plot was a predictable no-brainer and other than the main male character being cute, but not looking overly Chinese and with a UK accent SMH  (sorry, you guys aren't known for that either, no matter how many major universities you want to dominate via your wallet) the movie was primarily made up of a bunch of superficial wannabee's parading around in a state of confusion of trying to decide whether or not they wanted to honor their culture or mimic Americans.  The Asian woman with the short blonde hair had numerous opportunities and character potential of adding a lot more comedic life to this movie, but it just didn't happen.  Im sure you could rent a thousand different versions of this movie at any local Korean store so not sure what the hype was of this making it to  big screen.",4,1,GINA L,ZQ-YX-5bAs0,0.07854437229437229,2018-08-31 11:45:03,False,True

2018-09-01T21:30:38,"I was so looking forward to something funny, new and exciting.  This movie was a bore and I""m so glad I did not pay to go see this.  It was a cookie cutter version of a zillion other big-screen love stories except with a predominantly Asian cast with a lot of western (typical whether they want to admit it or not) influence.  Because there is now  a fast-growing  influx of Asians in the U.S. trying to buy up anything and everything tied to wealth and status in America including real estate, Disneyland, universities and a bunch of other stuff no one told them was for sell  (although US citizen will never be allowed to do the same in their country unless you are some 5th generation Asian or something that truly defines ""Crazy Rich Asians), this movie with the caucasian butler in the background and the the white guys losing their jobs immediately at the beginning of the movie was one of those ""Ok you've made your point.""  moments. You could also immediately tell that there was some Chinese person with cash sponsoring this on American big screen with a ""Hey look at us, we're here too and want to be noticed."" intentions.  This just seemed like something better-suited playing at some local theater in Shanghai or Beijing.  The plot was a predictable no-brainer and other than the main male character being cute, but not looking overly Chinese and with a UK accent SMH  (sorry, you guys aren't known for that either, no matter how many major universities you want to dominate via your wallet) the movie was primarily made up of a bunch of superficial wannabee's parading around in a state of confusion of trying to decide whether or not they wanted to honor their culture or mimic Americans.  The Asian woman with the short blonde hair had numerous opportunities and character potential of adding a lot more comedic life to this movie, but it just didn't happen.  Im sure you could rent a thousand different versions of this movie at any local Korean store so not sure what the hype was of this making it to  big screen.",1,2,Gina,ZQ-YX-5bAs0,0.07854437229437229,2018-09-01 21:30:38,False,True

Most Asians can't decide anything on their own because they always have to get permission from their parents to do anything. This comes from the dependent way of life that is ingrained in their heads from a young age. This, in turn, leaves them traumatized. I get pissed off because all my friends that I have can't decide anything by themselves without worrying about their family first. I do understand that they were ""Raised"" like this but this is still no justification to not break free from that mindset. Furthermore, this movie portrays Asians as rich and very successful when most of them live in poverty or are middle-class citizens in the motherland. The ones that do happen to get out of their motherland go to Europe or America then they act high and mighty. Then begin to socialize with white people for social status and ego. Their parents are messed up because they are the culprits to this vicious and cruel behavior that is taught by them. Come on Asians! get it together and start deciding things on your own before the old ways consume your very existence.",24,14,Aaron G.,ZQ-YX-5bAs0,0.1442712842712843,2018-09-05 04:21:07,False,True

The plot is unoriginal and there was no ‚Äòfeeling‚Äô or ‚Äòexcitement‚Äô- pretty boring and cheesy at times making some scenes super difficult to watch.  No one can deny the overhype the cast has created simply because of an all Asian cast and its significance of ‚Äúdiversity.‚Äù From my understanding of the word diversity in this context, it is the portrayal of various different races, which the film simply does not do (where‚Äôs the diversity if it‚Äôs all Asians?)  Lead actress Constance is such a cringe in and out of film. Her exaggerated pro-Asian stance is conflicted in her interviews where she displays a lack of knowledge in Asian culture and not to mention her inability to even speak her mother tongue. It seems more like an opportunity for her to rant about finally landing a job as a lead in a Hollywood film. (By the way, almost all the lead female actresses from the film are in real life dating white men and non Asian ethnicities. Hypocrisy?) The support it seems does not accurately reflect the movie itself (which is what is should be based on) but the cast and making of. I see a lot of comments saying that it has made them ‚Äúproud‚Äù to be Asian, or that they ‚Äúcried because they‚Äôve never seen themselves in a positive way.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry, but if you need to seek approval from Hollywood to accept yourself, then there‚Äôs more of an issue with you personally that I don‚Äôt think a movie can fix.

You want me to celebrate a movie that characterizes the rich and affluent lifestyle of a group of people MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE FROM IVY LEAGUE COLLEGES THAN WHITES, AND MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN A HIGHER INCOME BRACKET THAN EVERY OTHER MINORITY IN THE US?  I‚Äôm sorry, But what the fuck exactly are you people victims of again? Like seriously, what did I miss here? Why do you guys feel the sudden need to play the victim card? What fucking great injustice have you people suffered in America?   You guys are literally the white people of the east.   Same history of barbaric conquest with Dynasties in place of kingdoms.  Same asshole developed feudal systems.   Same backwards self-gratifying philosophies.   Same taste for pointless materialistic greed.   Same misplaced pride derived by social hierarchies put in place to make yourselves feel more important than you actually are.  Fair skinned Asian people are as vile and racist as whites. EVERY MINORITY KNOWS THIS WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH YOU PEOPLE. WHEN I THINK EGO AND ENTITLEMENT, I THINK WHITES AND ASIANS.   Literally every other race, from Hispanics to blacks to native Americans, has suffered WAY FUCKING MORE IN AMERICA AND CONTINUE TO SUFFER MORE THAN ANY ASIAN EVER HAS.   The victim complex mentality of this new age has run itself into a wall if we‚Äôre now going to be making movies of rich fucking assholes and calling it social progress.   And you‚Äôre a morally bankrupt asshole if you think you‚Äôre petty first world problems even compare. Being bullied isn‚Äôt shit when you‚Äôre parents are doctors and you own the house you live in.   Do yourselves a favor and don‚Äôt ever bother telling real minorities your petty problems...

There's this super rich guy crazy about my mother and after several times going out, he finally takes my mom to see his mother which her attitude was exactly the same like the mother from the rich boy in this movie. The first day my mom's bf met my mom, she didn't show her any affection or even a tiny smile to my mom but she also didn't say anything to my mom, she just stays in silence the whole time. Few days later she comes to my mother without her son knowledge and tell my mom to stay away from her son. My mom is a very religious person, she believes in karma. She was afraid if she makes a kid and a mother to be in a quarrel, one day her kids gonna do the same with her. She broke up with her bf afterwards, her bf was really crazy to my mom but she refused to meet him after his mom asked her to not to.  Sad story. But not really sad on my end, coz I'm a sperm that came from my dad, if my mother married that bloke, I most definitely not gonna be exist. Even if my father married another woman, I probably still not exist. The process sperm meets the eggs is more complicated than you thought.

In general many movie scripts kinda lack uniqueness they don't really offer any new/good life lessons its all stuff that was said before, hopefully this movie has something neat about it that stands out. I have the full documentary Overpriced in my channel, why is important information unrepresented so much? I have solutions in my channel can save millions of lives around the world in my channel, why isn't everyone caring and showing love for fellow humans? if you care about equality help spread the word about Overpriced, we can replace the fossil fuel industry with renewable energy from weed and more movie studios would be able to afford to hire more people. Please understand there are people that think there are too many humans and they don't want Overpriced to get seen by millions of people and save lives, we can do better than this...help share Overpriced it deserves more views than this (I totally made an effort to try and get friends to be part but they didnt like how I talk how weed can be cheap) it cost me a lot of money to make Overpriced and I work in wood shop full time so its even harder for me when it costs me money to make films that society is trying to prevent from being popular and saving lives...

I didn't care for the scene where ""Dr. Ken""(sorry, just typecasting,) tells his kids to eat up because-""there are starving children in America"". Nope. Not a fan of that line in any way. There are far too many suffering children and this joke was not funny in any way. The entire time I watched this movie all I could think about are all the villagers in Northern China whose villages have been burned down to make way for expensive highrise ghost town communities that enslave elderly farm families who are forced to go into debt $80,000 and up just to live in these giant cold freezing cement kingdoms. And no more family farm for them :( A very sad outcome. So for the poor people of China --- China is still a Communist Country? Yet, for the filthy rich, China is a basic free for all. Hmm. I guess I don't understand any of it. And the Uighers, the Muslims, the Tibetans!(who I adore)--all enslaved, beaten down and supposed to be forgotten about. This movie is what I call a Brain washing Commercial. Can I say that? I am an American. God help us all if this is the future. The Wedding scene was nice. No offense to any Chinese people. I just think it was like ""over the top""--maybe it's just me. The customs being passed down were nice.
