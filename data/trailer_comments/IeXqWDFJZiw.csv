2018-11-30T16:31:07,"I just rewatched Happy Death Day. Really enjoyed it. The story follows Tree Gelbman. She is a blissfully self-centered college girl who wakes up on her birthday in the bed of a student named Carter.  When a masked killer suddenly takes her life in a brutal attack, she once again magically wakes up in Carter's dorm room unharmed. Now she must relive the same day over and over until she figures out who is killing her.  Though it obviously borrows from Groundhog Day, this gleefully silly slasher movie has a playful spirit, likable characters, and even some life lessons. It's an average slasher movie. But also a wonderful horror/comedy fueled by a strong lead performance from the beautiful Jessica Rothe who plays Tree. Tree's journey to become a better person was almost more engaging than her journey of trying to survive the day.
