What Lara does means something to her personally, that's what drives the games, and since people not only play as her but come to care about her as a character, then what's important to her becomes important to the audience. The whole ""save the world"" thing has become far too overplayed and impersonal. Look at Civil War for example. The world wasn't at stake, everything that was at stake was personal to the characters and people cared about them so much, that their personal struggles came to mean something to audiences, people connected with the characters. This feels generic and impersonal right from the get go. If I wanted this and wanted to feel some personal gravity about the situation, I'd play the reboot game. You tried, but not hard enough.  Also, when you make the stakes ""Save the world"" you put yourself into a situation where there's only one possible outcome, so you already know how this ends.

It looks not as fun as the Indy movies, the National Treasure movies, the Fraser Mummy movies, and not even as the Jolie Lara Croft movies, as they all left me with intrigue and excitement, even the trailers. It's also not as cool as the Fast movies or as witty as the Kingsmen. It looks almost more like another boring Far Cry movie, even though it hits so much TR beats.  This has such a generic by the numbers feel to it and looks like a 6-7/10 netflix adaptation where I tell my friends that I was surprised the effects looked not as cheap as expected, but only watch it because it's part of the subscription and when you got nothing else to do.   The music and voiceover doesn't help either, it has a fanmade trailer vibe to it.   Only Nick Frosts appearance made me go ""ooooh"" and I smiled.

That CGI is god awful too, this is considered decent enough to show to the public for a multimillion dollar movie? For fucks sake they couldn't even get a poster right by making the environment and clothing look fake as well as her tool but looked like she elongated her neck. Plus she looks nothing close to either the original or the reboot. You can not say that she has the lack of a figure and still say she looks like either of the two sources. And I'm sensing a complete tonal shift near the end of the trailer. That's the ending scene. 100%. It's a bullshit cliffhanger ""look at her lookin all badass ready to go on another wacky adventure. Look she even has her guns, wow wee"". Does it want to be the reboot or does it want to be like the original.

A Mary Sue character most important feature is that everything in the world revolves around her (or him, if it is a Gary Stu, aka male). Everything about the story and the plot is build around the character. She is good at everything she does and everybody is admiring her even if there is no noticable reason for it. Just her name is causing a reaction although she never did anything to earn that reaction. Never breaking a sweat despite doing things an actual athlete might fail and she beeing a skinny teenager. And she is doing all that while looking pretty.  Even if all of that wouldn't be true the trailer is still very generic, showing mostly the highlights of the action scenes (which are most likely 90% of all the good action scenes in the movie. Because trailers..) and bulletpoints of the story. if there is any good action in the movie you don't see it in this trailer. Most of the acting here is staring in the distance like so many other young female actresses in the last years..  TL;DR: not impressed.

Why could they have not made this rendition more quiet, slow paced. Give tomb exploring a more intense feel, gives us anticipation of an intricate deadly traps setting off. Make that the focus of Tomb Raider, then on the second or third act play up a bit of action with the rival raiders or big bad.  This film just looks like something I've seen a dozen times already, but minus any iconic characters for the dead brain side of me to point at and go ""Oh. Look. That. Is. A. Thing. I. Recognize. From. My. Easily. Abused. Nostalgia."" while I slurp up my cola and not have the brain function to wipe the steady line of drool coming from my mouth.

I mean, if it does for you, I feel really bad for you if one little flaw can make or break an entire piece of entertainment. Idk, audiences these days seemed to have very restricted and narrow minds, very little room for anything else besides ridiculously high standards, or just a very very specific thing they want, that if they don't get it's terrible right off the bat. Haters act like a bunch of children in a candy shop, but they don't get the exact candy they want. There's a variation of it, in the same flavor, but since it's not the EXACT candy they want, it's terrible... even without trying it. They just look at it and go, ""Well, it's not the candy I want, so it's terrible. WAAAAHHH!! I WANT MY CANDY!!!!! *draws a shitty picture* THIS ONE!!!! GIVE IT TO ME NOW!!!! *stomps feet*"" <--- That's what all the haters in this comment section sound like. I mean, really... if you actually listen to yourselves rofl. It's rather amusing.

2017-09-20T13:53:23,"It's too stuck in the middle of the old and new Lara Croft. And she doesn't really look like the new Lara Croft. She doesn't look British enough. She looks more American. She doesn't have that English face. Also too skinny. Not as big a deal as with Wonder Woman, but still off. I mean, when you're so skinny you're skinnier than the rebooted Lara, you gotta put on some skin. Old Lara=thicc hot toned lady. New Lara=normal body, toned and pretty. This Lara=skinny almost lanky body, toned, and okay looking. I just think the casting was off. Hopefully, the acting is good. I mean, the suspension of disbelief is already there but it's fine because it's a video game and it's Lara Croft, but when you make her even skinnier than the reboot, and seemingly less muscle mass, how am I to believe she won't just die when she falls from a ledge? And based on what little footage we've seen, she doesn't really seem to act like the new or old Lara. Maybe it'll turn out fine, but she just seems kinda bland.

2017-09-20T14:17:09,"I'm really disappointed with the negative reactions here, Lara Croft is an idol of mine and will forever be one of my favorite video game franchises and character. I personally don't care about her physical traits, as long as they at least get the accent, hair, and eye color right. Which they did. Boobs should be entirely irrelevant. Lara was much more than that, she was intelligent, fierce, brave, and a complete badass who was willing to stop whoever or whatever was in the way of her objective. My only complaint with Tomb Raider was the rebooted game itself because it took a lot away from why we all loved playing as Lara. The classic Lara will forever be my favorite. At least for me, and she was iconic with her dual pistols- which made me so sad to see them stripped away in the reboot. So the last scene here had such an impact because the director here saw an opportunity to bridge a gap between the original we know and love with the reboot, which wasn't bad but could have been better. This is just an opinion, and everyone is entitled to their own of course, I am just choosing to be optimistic about this as a fan. So fingers crossed that this film breaks the curse of video game based films.

The new Lara is just way too serious for my tastes and she seems to be the same in this movie. That is why I prefer Uncharted over Tomb Raider because Nathan Drake is just a way more fun character.

I wish it would go a bit that route, but it looks like they are telling the tale of Lara Croft trying to stop and save the world from impending doom, not the adventurers who washed up on an island. It would make for some greater suspense and horror angles I feel.   Lastly, is she already comfortable killing? Her first kill in the game made her break down, it was hard to do, and it was just to hunt and survive. Her first human kill was out of necessity to survive. I want to see this, but it looks like she was already comfortable beating up and killing bad guys.",39,4,Chris Carlos,8ndhidEmUbI,-0.00906432748538012,2017-09-20 15:36:42,True,True

It's the first trailer but it already nailed the tone the reboot had and if you don't like it simply because you don't like the reboot and are hung up on the classic ones then just stick with those but don't go hating on the film simply because you want it to be more like the classic when it was obvious from the start that they were never going for it nor do they intend to go back to that.

Other directors have went down that path, and nearly all of them failed miserably. Furthermore, if you absolutely have to make a game-based movie, at least understand the game first. The original Tomb Raider movies(with Angelina Jolie) were, in my opinion, fucking terrible. Angelina Jolie certainly had the Lara Croft look at the time, but it was ruined by the director's focus on the spectacle rather than substance. I could understand that since the original Tomb Raider games were heavily gameplay-oriented, but since this movie is based on the 2013 reboot(which was criticized for focusing too much on cinematics instead of actual exploration), it's going to be even more embarrassing if you fail to appeal to even that game.",0,0,The Avid Gamer,8ndhidEmUbI,-0.1745842781557067,2017-09-20 16:18:09,True,True

However, the reason videogames can get away with substandard dialogue and/or story is because they can make up for it with what their audience really craves: a fun game. This is a movie. You fail at dialogue and storytelling and you've already lost 50% of the money you could have made otherwise because that is exactly half of what movie audiences want from you.

Of course it's only a trailer so who can say?! But I think we  can say lol.

I don't know how to do Tomb Raider in a way that makes it more good than fun. It's just modern day Indiana Jones with boobs, at least I felt that way playing it as a kid. Even that is giving it too much credit somehow. But these recent games are a lot more complex. I don't think Lara is that interesting of a character, her story is told over and over with nothing really new brought to the table. Just rehash. Almost like the plot to this film (it seems) with the TOMB RAIDER game reboot. Man, it has its moments. Maybe as a TV show or something. Stop trying to do a summer blockbuster apporach, Hollywood. And maybe get an actress who can emote. This chick was just like the exact same throughout the whole trailer lol. If thats what she was going for then well done. Videogame movies still suck I guess?

2017-09-20T17:00:30,"Part of the appeal of Tomb Raider, the games, is that you play AS Laura and are an ACTIVE participant to what she does and what happens to her. A Tomb Raider movie, on the other hand, makes you a PASSIVE participant‚Äîpretty much a prisoner to the script, dialogue and choices.   This franchise, and any other where the original source is a video game are doomed to be crappy. I think you can make a successful game based on a movie, but not a successful movie based on a game.  A movie turned into a game EXPANDS the universe and possibilities and can provide dozens of hours of entertainment, with hundreds of choices of how the story unfolds.  A game turned into a movie CONSTRICTS the universe, diminishes possibilities and usually fails to provide the same level of entertainment because the (usually disconnected filmmakers) rush/condense/homogenize the story/characters/locations due to a usual 2-hour constraint.   Also, because of the simple fact that REAL people need to perform UNREAL acts in UNREAL situations, usually with the heavy use of unrealistic CG, the suspension of disbelief is harder to achieve.

Even Lara's in-game boobs have been scaled down for the reboot, so the fact that the actress' ones are smaller doesn't matter. And it wouldn't have mattered anyway, you don't cast a role for boobs (unless you're Michael Bay), you cast a role for authenticity. It isn't the best trailer I've ever seen, and video game films do tend to flop, but perhaps this will turn the tide. I'm gonna go see it, and more than anything I hope to find that Vikander was cast for her ability to play a convincing Lara Croft rather than just because she's a lookalike.

A lil taste of the classic games at the end there. But the actress playing Lara in the games is one hll of a hotie and clearly knows how to act. Why not just cast her? I allways wondered why they didn't just go that rout. She honestly looks more like a Lara to me then Alicia does.... But again, don't mind her. Shes great! But yeah. It's gonna be fun to see if this becomes another train wreck or if it'll be a passable movie. My expectations are very low. There's honestly just one video game movie i think stands any chance of being good. And that's the Metal Gear Solid movie. Mostly because the director seems to understand the source material he is working with. And his ready to break every rule in the book of film making to ensure the movie stays true to the games. But yet adding his own flavor to it all. And he seems to have Mr. Kojima's blessing so if any movie based on games is set up for success it's that.

Their all invalid points, *first* of all: you should be exicted that the reboot of Tomb Raider 2013 and Rise of the Tomb Raider is getting a movie based version, *Second*: This is a Trailer not a finished version of the movie, ""Third*: their is are no rating or reviews we have seen bassd on this movie yet, *Fourth*: don't call it terrible when it's not out yet and predict it that it will be tied up garbage, based of your though of being sexist, *Fifth*: (""I don't know why but""), we don't even have a good glimpse if Uncharted will be a good movie or even a movie at all because Sony Financially is not doing well but their Electronic Portable music and PlayStation division is doing fine, *Sixth*: if you think you can make a better movie, what's your actors and actresses, your knowledge and research on how you will do it, what locations will you use the scenes out of, how many computer you need to make the movie scenes, and what's you budget and investment in this movie because it's quite expensive You guys don't explain point you just give biased brain dead conclusion that the movies is already a dumbster fire when we don't know at all what the movie will be like until we get a full understanding once we watch. Stop lying without coming out with things you know and give a very logical valid opinion about your thoughts on this trailer, not bash it entirely from one preview trailer seriously nothing but, console peasents and retardness of their fanboys.

They have changed Tomb Raider into a killer and not a Tomb Raider. Her first story when she was young in the legend game is when  she visits an island that is cursed. Basically they used that idea to start of this new remake of Tomb raider. But this is taking it too far. She doesn't even raid tombs in the games. She just Survives.  I like the idea but don't call it tomb raider when she doesn't even act like Lara.  The games are fun but they should of been called something else.  Also thumbs down on the trailer.

For me, they've totally ruined this by casting Alicia Vikander as Lara Croat. I'm not saying she isn't a talented actress. I'm just saying she's not a good Lara Croft, and I think the problem with her is that her features aren't very feminine. Lara Croft is supposed to be a femme fatale.

This new actress represents Lara in the 2010-17 games better, even though it wasn't the actress I'd choose. But maybe she'd be good. Idk but you guys shouldn't be expecting Lara of the old tomb raiders but Lara of the new. The new ones have been less about lara being a hot slut with guns, and more about a survival coming of age story about a young ""strong"" British girl. Seems like they did the same with the actress. Mind you, actresses are not only chosen on looks reminiscent to the character but how they play that character. Don't think the movie will be bad because ""Alicia Vikander"" doesn't look like her.

At least in the game Lara jumps off the sinking boat to reach the hand of a friend trying to save her. This movie she just grabs a huge ass bag and jumps into the middle of nowhere. How logical.  And don't get me started on the jump stunts. For a movie basing itself on the more realistic latter games, she jumps abnormally high. The old Lara used to do that. I prefer the old Lara, she was incredibly smart, tougher than most men and yet more feminine than most women and feared no obstacle. The new Lara is fairly feminine, physically weaker than most men she encounters, and isn't really that clever, she just gets lucky. I really don't get how the new Lara is a statement to female rights given the old Lara was more competent. So she had huge boobs. Big deal. So sexist, right?

That was a huge theme of the first game too, to humanize her. If she gets too bad ass (even though it's awesome) most of the audience wouldn't even flinch everytime she get's hurt or in a pickle situation. This is just a trailer so I'm not too worried.  I also don't like how they just narrates what lara supposed to do from what it seems like in this trailer. In the game she was never litteraly told by her father to ""destroy the tomb blabla"". She was given clues and a naturally curious person, and when she finds the problem she actually learns to solve it by herself. So it almost feels like they were watering down lara's father figure to me. But I hope the actual movie is not as straight forward as I thought it would be.  I know this is the movie and that was the game and those two were completely different media of story telling, but since they were tied I thought it would make sense to point out few things that's important to the story telling aspect to me.

2017-09-21T14:17:06,"God‚Äôs Message To Mankind By Maester Patrick  (I.S.o.B.P. - International School of Biblical Prophecy - Youtube.com/ISOBP )  Accept This Gift: Pray to Jesus and Ask for Your sins to be Covered then Seek Water Baptism.  GOD LOVES YOU. However, God does not Condone your sins. ‚ÄúGood‚Äù people Have Committed Sins as well. As You have not lived a Perfect life. Nor has Anyone else. Your sins have Made you a Sinner before God. The Penalty for Your sins is the Curse of Death. However there Is Good news: Someone who never Committed a sin, Can be Your Substitution, such a Person May Carry Your Judgment for Your sins, In Your place. God‚Äôs Love for You Inspired Him to send His son, Who‚Äôs capable of Living a Life Without Sin, and made him undergo the curse of Death in your place. This is How Eternal Life becomes Accessible to you. As Jesus, Gods son, Never Committed A sin during His Earthly Life, so By the Law of Sin and Death, God was obligated to resurrect Him, Rightfully, as that Law Only Applies to Sinners. Eternal life Cannot be Obtained by means of Money, Nor is there a way to ‚ÄúEarn‚Äù the right that God Pardons you from the Curse of Death with your Own Efforts of Recompense for Your Sins. You are unable to ‚ÄúDeserve‚Äù it, It‚Äôs a Gift from God. Its Up to You to Choose if you Accept this Gift, and When You do so, God Arranged the Forgiveness of your sins and Will Choose to Forget that You ever Committed Them. Those Who Accept this Gift will Become Sons and Daughters of God, and No Longer be Separated From Him. Such will Receive Access to the Holy Spirit and Will Dwell in Heaven with God in the Afterlife. After your reunition with GOD, the Holy Spirit Will Help You To Not Return to that old Lifestyle of Committing Sins, Lest You Become Separated from God Again, Nor should You Desire To Be found Abusing God‚Äô Grace Upon You.

None of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness they are guilty of  and because of the sins they have committed, they will die. ‚ÄúYet you say, ‚ÄòThe way of the Lord is not just.‚Äô Hear, you Israelites: Is my way unjust?

But if a wicked person turns away from the  wickedness they have committed and does what is just and right, they will save their life. Because they consider all the offenses they have committed and turn away from them, that person  will surely live; they will not die.  Yet the Israelites say, ‚ÄòThe way of the Lord is not just.‚Äô Are my ways unjust, people of Israel?

Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.  Blessed are those who are persecuted  because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  ‚ÄúBlessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great  is your reward in heaven, for in the same  way they persecuted the prophets who  were before you. __________________________________________ __________________________________________ Matthew 5:13-16  Salt and Light ‚ÄúYou are the salt of the earth.

A town  built on a hill cannot be hidden.  Neither do people light a lamp and put it  under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand,  and it gives light to everyone in the house.

Therefore  anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and  teaches these commands will be called great in  the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly  not enter the kingdom of heaven.  Murder ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said to the people long ago,  ‚ÄòYou shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.‚Äô But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‚ÄòRaca,‚Äô is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‚ÄòYou fool!‚Äô will be in danger of the fire of hell.  ‚ÄúTherefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them;  then come and offer your gift.  ‚ÄúSettle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.  Adultery ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall not commit  adultery. But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully  has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your  right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and  throw it away. It is better for you to lose one  part of your body than for your whole body to be  thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes  you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away.  It is better for you to lose one part of your  body than for your whole body to go into hell.  Divorce ‚ÄúIt has been said, ‚ÄòAnyone who divorces his  wife must give her a certificate of divorce.‚Äô  But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery,  and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.  Oaths ‚ÄúAgain, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‚ÄòDo not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.‚Äô But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God‚Äôs throne;or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 36 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. All you need to say is simply ‚ÄòYes‚Äô or ‚ÄòNo‚Äô; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.   Eye for Eye ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòEye for eye, and tooth for tooth.‚Äô But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. 40 And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.  If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who  wants to borrow from you.  Love for Enemies ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòLove your neighborand  hate your enemy.‚Äô But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and  the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you  get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you  greet only your own people, what are you doing more than  others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect,  therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.",0,0,XxGoodSpiritxX,8ndhidEmUbI,0.1274891774891775,2017-09-21 16:14:33,True,True

2017-09-21T16:15:36,"Matthew 24  The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times  Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention  to its buildings.‚ÄúDo you see all these things?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúTruly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.‚Äù  As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives,  the disciples came to him privately. ‚ÄúTell us,‚Äù they said, ‚Äúwhen will this happen, and what  will be the sign of your coming and of the end  of the age?‚Äù  Jesus answered: ‚ÄúWatch out that no one deceives  you.For many will come in my name, claiming, ‚ÄòI am the Messiah,‚Äô and will deceive many.You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it  that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.  ‚ÄúThen you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,  but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.  And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to  all nations, and then the end will come.  ‚ÄúSo when you see standing in the holy place ‚Äòthe  abomination that causes desolation,‚Äô spoken of through the prophet Daniel‚Äîlet the reader understand‚Äî  then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.  Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. How dreadful it will be in  those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now‚Äîand never to be equaled again.  ‚ÄúIf those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. At that time if anyone says to you, ‚ÄòLook, here is the Messiah!‚Äô or, ‚ÄòThere he is!‚Äô do not believe it.  For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you ahead of time.  ‚ÄúSo if anyone tells you, ‚ÄòThere he is, out in the wilderness,‚Äô do not go out; or, ‚ÄòHere he is, in the inner rooms,‚Äô do not  believe it.For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the  Son of Man.  Wherever there is a carcass,  there the vultures will gather.  ‚ÄúImmediately after the distress of those days  ‚Äú‚Äòthe sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.‚Äô  ‚ÄúThen will appear the sign of the Son of Man in  heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn  when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of  heaven, with power and great glory. And he will  send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will  gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of  the heavens to the other.  ‚ÄúNow learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right  at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will  certainly not pass away until all these things have  happened. Heaven and earth will pass away,  but my words will never pass away.  The Day and Hour Unknown  ‚ÄúBut about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 39 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it wil be  at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill;  one will be taken and the other left.  ‚ÄúTherefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.  So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.  ‚ÄúWho then is the faithful and wise servant,  whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at  the proper time? It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he  returns. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, ‚ÄòMy master is staying away a long time,‚Äô and he then begins to beat his  fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. The master of that servant will come on a day when  he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ___________________________________________",0,0,XxGoodSpiritxX,8ndhidEmUbI,0.09090975896531453,2017-09-21 16:15:36,True,True

Actually it is nothing like the reboot game, that they promised. In the Square-Enix 2013 Tomb Raider Lara was not an action hero, nor a genious. She was a smart girl well versed in history and survival craft, but apart from that, she had a normal, real, actually relatable human psyche. She was afraid of going through wrecks over waterfalls, she had to talk to herself to calm down, she cried because of stress. Here, she is showed as the oldschool genious action hero she was in the Angelina Jolie movies, making hero poses with pistols and solving age old mysteries during her onboarding sessions.  It just... losts the whole birth of a hero feeling. Lara in the game was NOT ready. She had to constantly search and find new sources of inner strength, she had to face situations, where your only choices where terrible and dangerous, and had to grow up to it before your very eyes. You could see her in a situation where you know you WOULD have given up, because you could not do it, but she had no choice! Now she just goes in to kick ass while being sexy. And while that is fun to an extent - like for five minutes -, it does'nt make a good plot.  The story lost the... actually, what it lost was the story.

Here you have a trailer about a movie with decent cinematography, decent pre-production effects and an Oscar-Nominated actress, yet all you can point out is the bust size?  Newsflash: Women in real life do not have big busts like Mary Jane Watson/Sue Storm/Lara Croft. Maybe Hollywood was more interested in someone who could actually emote and give you a decent performance. Sure, the plot looks a bit thin, but the games were like that too. As long the main characters are great (one of them is being played by Walton Goggins, come on), the movie will be fine.  THIS is why we never get good video game adaptations.

To me this isn't the fully mature adult Lara, this is the archaeological student who was raised as a survivalist that begins taking after her father in examining such dangerous and powerful things that eventually leads her to become the legend.  Hell, the trailer even says ""HER LEGEND BEGINS"".  It also references an island in some dangerous zone(the Devil's Sea here whereas in the game it was called the Dragon's Triangle) where she gets shipwrecked and taken prisoner by the locals.  It seems to blend the first reboot and its sequel ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"" because the villain is an organization known as ""Trinity"" which is the primary antagonist of said game.   To me, Alicia Vikander pulls of that depiction of Lara wonderfully.  I'm excited for this movie, but apprehensive, as a lot of video game movies are garbage.

Her face (mocap), body, and voice are Lara and a large part of what made the recent video games great is what Camilla brought to the table and made her version of Lara such a likable character. I mean she acted her out already for the games why couldnt they just get her. Also dont hurt me for saying this but Alicia just looks like she's doing a really bad cosplay of Lara.¬†  Also this is just my bias but she's not that beautiful for Lara in my opinion. I'm not asking for busty oversexualized triangle tits Lara I'm just asking for someone more prettier (dont hurt me please). Alicia to me just reminds me of like somene's sister.

She looks the part, has the accent down and tbh it's unfair not to give her a chance before actually seeing how well she does in the movie. This could be awesome. We don't know.

I feel like Lara's face had drastically changed in the past years and this just throws it off even more. I heard someone say they should have chose a cross fit woman or someone who has a comparable physic to the actual character and I completely agree. Lara is not just a voice, she is the body, voice, attitude, etc which I feel was not represented.

Takes away from who Lara is, she was a normal girl who found her self in a very bad spot and dug deep pushing beyond her limits. Now the muscle can help me actually see her being able to do all this, but being ripped takes away from her digging deep, like Lara had to do. The fact she use to watch other people play tells me she doesn't fully know the character. But no real risk of overplaying her part. The save the world plot that was over done and was so bad that any shitty spy kids movie would know not to touch that again. The scenes here that are taken from the game, might harm it. Some things are just best left in video games, because seeing them play out rather then being a part of it are way different.

Also, in the scene where she's picking a gun the mannerisms seem really fake when she's trying to look cocky.

Could have gone with better clothes, heck better make up. How can you not have black eyeliner to make her look a bit more amazonian?   Alicia Vikander is a great actress but not sure if she can fit in to Lara Croft character. She was amazing in latest Jason Bourne movie but this... Sophia Butella, Adrianne Palicki, Chloe Benette, Gina Carrano.....all better options as Lara Croft. AV's voice is also not suitable for this role.

2017-09-27T14:55:26,"Well, as a big fan of the Tomb Raider series (both games and movies) I'd say this is mediocre. We all knew Angelina wouldn't play Lara again because she got older, and directors won't cast her again.  I mean, I grew up on her movies, and Tomb Raider was the one that left the most impact and influence on me. Now let me tell you why.   Lara Croft is a person that every female should look up to. She's independent, strong, fearless, smart, extremely attractive and capable. We've seen her fighting demi-gods, animals, humans, robots etc. We've seen her driving all sorts of vehicles. We've seen her solving every problem she got caught up in. Well, at least judging by all games I've played. I think Angelina was the perfect choice for Lara's character. She completely nailed her personality and she trained for months to get her physique. That's why audience LOVED Angelina, for completely taking down her character.   That's the Lara Croft we expect this actress to portray.   Sadly, I think that producers focused on the game that came out couple years ago, the only Tomb Raider game I disliked. Because it shows Lara before she became badass. She was trapped on that island, fighting for her dear life. It was cringe worthy for me to play the game, it's not the Lara I was used to. So making a movie based on that plot is just going to be bad. Everyone is used to Lara the way she was back when Angelina shot the two movies.   I'll watch this nonetheless, but I'm ready to be disappointed. Also the main actress looks very lifeless, where are her badass facial expressions? Like, who am I watching? Lara Croft or some random scared chick? üòß",1,0,s t r a w b e r r y ‚Äî d r a g o n,8ndhidEmUbI,-0.0059932306255835585,2017-09-27 14:55:26,True,True

2017-09-27T15:51:12,Okay time to make an actual contribution here... When I saw a picture of the new tomb raider movie with Lara in her tank top and pick axe my entitial thoughts were oh cool maybe this will be good because they seem to understand that the rebooted game did super well and that they should have the same focus. However after seeing more from the trailer it looks like they don't understand why the game did so well because it has none of the meat and just the bare bones. They reduce all of the key characters from the game like Lara's mentor to one character who will likely be a love interest. Boo. The games did so well because of the story not purely because of the action which they seemed to fall back on yet again. Next time you make another game movie or reboot of something popular try doing some damn research into what made it so popular. Find some fans and ask them instead of presuming you understand when you don't. At best chances are that this will be just an okay movie but a giant missed opportunity because of people who can't relate to the fan base.,0,0,Kevin W.

She doesn't look to have the stamina or strength Lara has to have to defeat a island of over zealous religious psychos. Of course, that might not even be the case in this movie as much as it's changed. For some reason it looks like Mathias is the head of Trinity? What is happening here? What about Himiko?

And in the game they made sure to make her afraid, uncertain and hurt (a lot) to make her a dynamic character, and to make her more relatable. And i believe they did a great job in that factor in the game. But here they are trying to make it out that shes done all this before and all like she knows what to do. And thats an awful idea. Stop trying to make it out that all main characters have to be strong from the getgo to make them good.

Need for speed 2014, again a shit movie, didn't even watch it. (took it based on ratings)  At the end of the day, I'm not certain that tomb raider would be a good film. The trailer has given the plot away and already it sounds so generic. Father dies, gives his life's work to son/daughter and now the world is on someone's hand to save it. Then chuck in some John Wick/007 action, but in a jungle with a bow to stop some evil conspiracy.

That probably is going to be as close as we're ever going to get to any kind of true success story here.   As far as Tomb Raider goes it sounds like it's a hit and miss.  For starters Alicia as good as she is was completely miscast here.   Not nearly as painful as her husband in Assassin's Creed. But bad enough to pretty much guarantee another 10 years in the crypt vault lol.   I was really hoping it was going to be different this time but it seems that directors just can't help themselves.   Always thinking they can do a better job than what the original source material had given us.   Seriously I was expecting something with a little bit more effort put forth here. Instead of just cheery picking scenes.   Then copy and pasting a script on top of it as that's just lazy writing. Hollywood needs to do us a favor and just stop embarrassing themselves. R.I.P.

First off the girl who plays her is a crapy  actress who needs to eat a hamburger. I mean in the game they lowered her bra size not make her a double for a UFC fighter. Second she's annoying and stupid. Her father is missing 7 years but she won't sign papers saying he's dead because that will make him dead. Hello stupid sign the papers and now you have the resources to go looking for him and then if you find him you can just give him back his stuff. Instead she risks losing his house, company, and everthing he worked for, as well try to pawan the necklace that was her mothers and the last thing he gave her.In the game she newly graduated as archeologist, movie... never went to collage. Because all this knowledge is like magically in her head? Game has friends who go with her to island, some who don't make it back, which is one of the reasons she had such a hard time in the second game.  Movie she meets some radom dude they become very close so they will risk their lives for each other. There is no Jonah, no captain, no anyone from the actual crew of the endurance. Game Hemeko was and evil witch type creature whose existence made lara believe in myths and legends. Movie she was a queen who sacrificed herself so the world would survive a disease that she carried. Those proving There is no magic, and myths are just that, myths. Second movie, you meet Ana, you think she is on your side so shock when you find out otherwise. Movie you find out at the end that she is working for them. Sorry had to get this off my chest.

Actors did quite a good job, and the cinematics were pretty too, but this movie just lacked the tomb raider spirit. Counting the fact that they relied on 2013 tomb raider game's plot they should've just stuck to it rather than turning himiko into ebola spreading mummy or making lara's and her father's reunion the only magical moment in the entire movie. It's like creators knew nothing of the franchise. They completely wasted all the potential that tomb raider world could have offered, and created another soulless hollywood ""action"" movie.

Mathias sucked as compared to the game Mathias , Himiko was nothing similar to the game Himiko, the whole story was shortened and altered to death. Other somewhat similar points were Mathias trying to act ruthless and his sadistic followers who would  kill a beautiful girl rather than having fun with her, they haven't gotten laid in forever as it is. I loved killing them in the game. Ruthless assholes need killing. I found also very odd in the game, that there were no other women around, except Samantha and Lara. Guess they are all gay then, both in the game and the movie. And where the hell were the other crew members, not to mention that the Endurance in the movie is just a rusty fishing boat. The one in the game was a modern big ship. In the movie they act the same as in the game, mindless zombies with assault rifles. At least in the game had pistols, bows, machetes,makeshift armor, etc, survival mode. In the movie, they are well equipped. And what the hell was that with the father ? In the game the father is maybe dead, maybe not, he does not show up in the game whatsoever.

Estamos viendo otra repeticion en la cual encuentran otro tipo de caja de pandora, la cual tambien tiene una plaga o enfermedad que afecta a la humanidad tipo tomb raider la cuna de la vida???

If I had to say anything about this movie it would be.....  thank you. You nailed Lara in her early days. First tomb etc. First time I saw this I thought once she  got to the island the villain was a lil over the top. Like a cliche of most villains. But. as it went on I got it.... so it may be cliche or is it??? Yes... no.... wait..... huh??? I can't be quite sure. It was well done and I love it. Guys.... keep it going your on to something that will reverberate through the years. Yes you got inspiration from the games. But. I think you have interpreted gameplay to cinematic emotional reaction or something like that perfectly or as close to perfectly and acceptable for most of us. You captured Lara's bravery and everything we( Okay maybe just me) love about Lara.  Haters will hate.. but whatever. You have something and I hope you keep it going. I would give this 4 n a half to five stars. Looking forward to more from you guys,0,0,NasTe Ronin,8ndhidEmUbI,0.3280701754385965,2018-11-27 03:32:07,False,False

Tomb Raider was like the Legend of Zelda with guns, and a badass female lead;   ALSO FIGHTING A T-REX.  Tomb Raider 2013 would be like making Pokemon into a super edgy, hyper violent monster summoning anime where the Poke-balls are magical artifacts and the Pokemon kill each other.  Or like turning Grand Theft Auto into a ""Street Gangsta works undercover for the police to overthrow an illegal network of car-thieves and chop-shops"".  Or like if they remade Devil May Cry's Dante into a hard-boiled detective who has to stop a secret demon invasion when he learns that his father, who taught him the trade of being a Private Investigator, was actually a demon spy who betrayed the armies of Hell and discovers he has super powers.  That'd be like if Resident Evil swapped out Umbrella and the B.O.W.s for a Necromancer Cult and supernatural zombies and demons.

AV did her best in this movie. she is a very good method actress. Best suited for innocent,fragile characters such as Light between Oceans, Royal affair. She doesn't has the strong feminist look or frame. Imagine Iron Man played by someone other than Robert J or Wolverine played by some one other than Huge J or Thanos. Casting does miracles. If found the right match it shines. Unfortunately they made a bad casting. And movie is also has lot of plot holes. Though Anjelina is bad actress she is best suited for feminism. If this is a movie a girl lost a father at young age and again find him and with some adventure this could have been acceptable. For a Tomb Raider movie this plot is horrible. Being a countess the female lead can't speak multi languages and does learn combat skills in a cheap dojo doesn't add up with a girl with such a rich lineage.
