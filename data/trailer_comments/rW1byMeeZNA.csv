Wtf?) 3) is apparently a fighter but doesn't have the common sense required not to try to take on all those decepticons by herself like, ""Oh yeah, bring it!""

She's a physical badass, she's flawed and imperfect and just a great character who happens to be female.   Just write a normal character who happens to be a chick!

2017-03-19T05:52:44,"You have it all wrong people. This is not about feminism. This is about a little kid acting all tough/cool in front of us but due to her ""age"" it's REALLY VERY HARD TO TAKE HER SERIOUSLY.  And understandably so. Because even though men and women can fight and survive a war.. it is unfathomable that a little kid can participate and make a difference in battle let alone survive it. The bravery shown by this kid is quite very rare if not nonexistent. To me, it just sounds like a rebellious commentary. It's just hard to take it seriously.  This video is selling us the idea that kids are not to be underestimated. That we should listen to them and take them seriously. All I can say is that it's VERY HARD TO DO THAT.  Because even though the world is changing and Eve is rising up to claim her rightful place as Adam's equal.. the idea that a child can earn the right to be an adult just feels impossible. Children are meant to let a man (or a woman) do a man's job. They're meant to grow up first before they're allowed of anything (like joining the war effort).  Because in the real world, it would take a miracle for any kid to survive in a fight to the death.",1,0,Kingdom Hearts,rW1byMeeZNA,-0.1383862433862434,2017-03-19 05:52:44,True,True

You see, I was a script auxiliary for a publishing branch hired to support this film and during the preliminary brainstorming for the new trailer I......disrupted the course effect. Or farted rather in mid discourse. And not a small fart either, but big and loud. So loud did it cause the core writing team to stun, and even the group reporter to flee in terror.  Now, the smell -- a smell I now know must have caused some an amount of brain damage -- perforated so profusely that by the end of the committee briefing, everyone thought the movie was about 13 year old girl who could not only create robots at will, but could ultimately destroy them using harsh language and 20 oz. bottles of bird urine. Fortunately, the janitor, who at the time was not affected by the meeting's debacle, entered the room and reminded us all that the movie was about   Transformers and not some unorthodox comic book heroine.   What you see now is a hurried, frantic re-write of that day's production. Again, I'm sorry for all of this and shall endeavor to steadfast my bowels in the future.

This is the 21st century, we should have a positive role model, no matter the gender (male or female).  The actress (forgot her name :/ ) is supposed to represent equality since in the last 4 movies, the real main human character in each were male. So this is a good change. She could make the movies better. (Some parts are bad, some good, some okay. All movies have problems.) We'll get good character development, but still will get more Robots fighting and less humans talking.  Besides, she looks tougher than Sam Witwicky (I am insulting the character, not Shia Lebouf).

We don't know the context of the speech. We don't know WHY she said these things. For all we know, when she gives the speech it's because she just saved someone's ass. Someone who had doubted her for the entire movie. Yes, I agree that we need more of the robots and less of the humans. But have any of you ever thought that maybe, with the way Earth is starting to look in these movies, that humans are dying off? Or are going to be dying off very quickly? Cuz, I mean, Earth is starting to look pretty inhospitable to me. It's all speculation at this point, but maybe the radiation cybertronians give off (first movie, anyone?) is starting to kill the planet.  And, you know, for those people saying 'she's trying too hard to seem tough,' we literally just watched her march up to Megatron and ORDER him to put her friend down. I'm sorry, but could any of you do the same? I'll tell you right now, I like to think of myself as someone who could do the same, but let's be honest here. I would turn tail and run.

Now it's time to come up with a perfect way how to get people to see your shitty movie! And that is (drum roll please) patatatatatata! Guilt the viewers into seeing it!!! How you may ask?

That's why whenever a woman starts bragging about how amazing she is at being a man (even though she claims to be actually a woman) she starts sounding like a little boy with an inferiority complex. That's what that cringe you felt when you watched this. It's watching a little girl (written by a big powerful female-who-don't-need-no-man) brag about how much of a woman she is while using male-defining metrics to prove she's a bad ass.   In story-telling, when a male protagonist is insecure about his abilities, he brags about his prowess just like this La Ni√±a does. Then he's forced to endure trials to become a more mature, less brash version of himself, with REAL abilities that don't need verbal diarrhea to substantiate. The difference in modern cinema is that the girl has no story arc, no development, no meaningful voice. She is static and boring, fully formed Mary Sue. Like mythological Venus from her shell.   As a result no one cares about her, even though she spends the whole film (or trailers now for pity-sake) begging you to. Modern cinema is abusing and lying about women and they all think it's ground-breaking. That's why, unless we see a massive revolution in writing in Hollywood, women will never achieve equality on the action screen. They will always be relegated to either the shadows or the front of a gaudy, blaring parade because they refuse to let their heroines earn their scars and skills.",0,0,interestedmeow,rW1byMeeZNA,-0.008333333333333326,2017-03-30 16:22:21,True,True

2017-03-31T17:14:35,"Why is it considered absurd and offensive to say a woman ""can't"" do something a man can do? Furthermore, why is that an immediately uncomfortable concept to women? Men do no not take offense or refuse to accept that they can't bare children, literally something only women are capable of.  Yes, we know that females and males are mostly similar in almost every way, so why not accept that there is also a natural balanced state of gender specific hormonal, physiological, and neurological roles as well? Think of the Yin and Yang symbol. A dichotomy of equal but opposing presences, each containing a small amount of the other. Equal in their differences, not one greater because of them. THAT message is missing in today's media.  Why the clear antagonistic reminder that female humans are just as competitive in nature as male humans? This information is learned at a very early stage in development and certainly not worth it's current repetition, urgency, and self righteousness.  I caution the danger of not only indoctrinating the over masculinization of our young females, but also the trend in the over feminization of our young males. Both heavily present in this film. (or at least the trailer)  It's not bigotry or sexism. Understanding specific gender roles within any species including our own is far more useful and logical than forcing an unnatural homogenization of ability and will between them. Portraying intelligent, nurturing, and emotional females is as equally important as portraying intelligent, strong males with integrity.  Some lead and protect while others organize and prepare. Different roles for different individuals because of the difference in genetic proclivity only, and for no other reason or agenda. This is a fundamental principal of which all forms of life obey in some manner or another.",0,0,Mike W,rW1byMeeZNA,0.08752083333333333,2017-03-31 17:14:35,True,True

2018-04-23T21:40:16,"The problem with this, and I will be honest I haven't seen any of the Transformers films, mainly because the clips I have seen looked awful, but from seeing this trailer and the portrayal of the character, the main problem is that they pretty much broke one of the most important rules of film and creating characters especially. Show, don't tell.  If you want to have a great female character as a role model, prove she is strong, don't keep saying it.   Examples of how this works can easily be shown through popular female characters like Hermione Granger; Katniss Everdeen; Eleven/ Jane Ives, Toph; Azula; Mabel Pines and Pearl (Steven Universe). These all are great characters who have proved they are strong and empowering female characters for young girls and teenagers, by proving themselves. THEY show that they can be quick witted; smart; a wise leader and also kind hearted (Hermione); fierce, tough, powerful, clever (Katniss Everdeen); a survivor, bright, spectacular and bold (Eleven); sassy, hilarious, cunning and also a blind warrior!! (Toph); a terrifying, confident, sneaky, puissant and awesome villain (Azula); a funny, crazy, fun and weird and bizarre 12 year old (Mabel Pines); or a graceful, Samurai like warrior with a ballerina inspired grace who is a great gay representation (Pearl). Neither of them needed to bash the audiences head with how strong of a great feminist role modal they are.   They showed it with their strengths, personalities but also weaknesses. We didn't see them as girls or women, we see them as people, which is so much important. How would it feel if every time someone argued or said something to Katniss Everdeen, she would just argue that its because she is a female. She didn't have to say that. Even though she is a typical tough and strong and independent heroine, but had a interesting and tragic backstory that should why she was so stubborn and insolent character in a dystopian world of poverty; as well as having a loyal and brave persona, despite the mental torture she goes through. Michael Bay only wrote about the clich√© and traditional look of a strong warrior, not the persona and skills or weakness she has. He wrote a female character that would have been shocking in 1940s-50s, and not a contemporary one for todays audiences.   Michael Bay, read about Katniss and Hermione in the books. Watch Avatar: The Last Airbender the animation series. Watch Gravity Falls and watch Mabel Pines. Watch Steven Universe, and how the female gem aliens are all fierce and incredibly powerful with emotional back stories. And take some notes for once about how to write actual female characters.",0,0,Anna Rose,rW1byMeeZNA,0.17060760294455954,2018-04-23 21:40:16,False,False
