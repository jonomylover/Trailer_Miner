Some storylines are okay, and possibly heartwarming, but as a Christian woman raised with a Muslim dad I couldn't help but see how ignorant and narrow-minded this entire movie is.  Anyone and anything that wasn't Christian in this movie was put in a bad light, especially Muslims, Atheists and Chinese people.  Beginning with the girl who grew up in a traditional Muslim family, and was 'secretly Christian'. The sound of that plot itself is unrealistic, but they made it so against Islam it looked like pure stereotype. Starting with the stereotype of 'Muslim women not actually wanting to wear a hijab'. The fact that she did it for her dad was fine as I sometimes wear one if I'm in his country out of respect, but the way they made it look like she hated wearing it or was forced to wear it was just plain stupidity as real Muslim women I know choose to wear their hijabs for their religion and no one else! Then came the entire dads reaction thing!! I couldn't believe my eyes at the blatant ignorance and propaganda displayed in front of me! Making the Muslim man in the film seem abusive and violent, kicking his daughter out of the house for being Christian! This really hit me as a Christian woman with a Muslim dad, as my dad, would never lay his hands on me in violence- and definitely wouldn't kick me out of the house. On this part I have to remind you of all the teen kicked out of churches and Christian homes for being gay. Something much more common but the people around me when watching this movie chose to ignore.  Then of course was the literal point of the entire movie: debunking atheists. Obviously this movie couldn't have even possibly tried to do that normally, no, they had to make the main atheist a literal psychopath who used to be Christian but lost his mum at 12 to cancer and has a Christian girlfriend who he is insensitive towards. Oh and he just happens to suddenly confess his belief in God after he gets hit by a car and and later dies. No bias whatsoever😂.   Then comes the Chinese guy. Can't be an American propaganda-like movie without hating on the Chinese. I have honestly nothing to say except do you really think any of that storyline was realistic? Honestly?  Just honestly I was cringing from the ignorance and trashiness of this film throughout. If you haven't seen it don't waste your time. It is blatant propaganda, and if you showed me an outline of this storyline I could tell you within the first sentence that it is by some Christian group in the Southern states. If you can't see the bias and honest racism/islamophobia/stereotypes in this movie you are blind.",28,2,Amina B,8eFlAY0D0ho,0.007407407407407409,2017-02-14 14:27:08,False,False

No philosophy teacher would ever say that or make students give up their beliefs. And why are every atheist in your movies painted as an evil self absorbed liberal? Not all atheists are far left! I found it disturbing that at the end of the movie, Keven Sorbos death was considered a celebration. That's messed up. This is coming from the movie that argues that secular people cannot have morals without god. Which is totally ridiculous. Or that Atheists are the way they are because something bad happened in their life. Your films mainly give other Christians comfort in their beliefs, nothing more.",0,1,megan nordbeck,8eFlAY0D0ho,-0.12222222222222222,2017-04-11 11:44:46,False,False

2017-12-27T13:58:02,"""Why do you hate God?""  As if that's not the easiest thing to answer.  Firstly, I hate God (or rather the concept, because it's fruitless to hate something that isn't real) because God is supposedly the very concept of morality (the argument; ""You can't be moral without God"") and that means that if you act out with his commandments and ideals stated in the Bible then you are immoral by default. Secondly, I hate God because if God is real then I have no free will (free will; being free of predetermined fate or destiny or being able to make ones own decisions) because God knows and has created everything, meaning that my fate is determined, which is in contrast to the definition of free will. Thirdly, I hate God because believing in something obviously requires faith, which means he wants to force me to have faith in him, yet won't prove himself to me, at threat of eternal suffering in Hell (what a loving guy).   The film is right, God's not dead. But that's because God never existed.",1,0,Madden,8eFlAY0D0ho,-0.00571428571428572,2017-12-27 13:58:02,False,False

2018-09-13T17:53:35,"The Bible never records Jesus saying the precise words, “I am God.” That does not mean, however, that He did not proclaim that He is God. Take for example Jesus’ words in John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” We need only to look at the Jews’ reaction to His statement to know He was claiming to be God. They tried to stone Him for this very reason: “You, a mere man, claim to be God” (John 10:33). The Jews understood exactly what Jesus was claiming—deity. When Jesus declared, “I and the Father are one,” He was saying that He and the Father are of one nature and essence. John 8:58 is another example. Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth … before Abraham was born, I am!” Jews who heard this statement responded by taking up stones to kill Him for blasphemy, as the Mosaic Law commanded (Leviticus 24:16). John reiterates the concept of Jesus’ deity: “The Word [Jesus] was God” and “the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14). These verses clearly indicate that Jesus is God in the flesh. Acts 20:28 tells us, “Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.” Who bought the church with His own blood? Jesus Christ. And this same verse declares that God purchased His church with His own blood. Therefore, Jesus is God! Thomas the disciple declared concerning Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28). Jesus does not correct him. Titus 2:13 encourages us to wait for the coming of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ (see also 2 Peter 1:1). In Hebrews 1:8, the Father declares of Jesus, “But about the Son he says, ‘Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.’” The Father refers to Jesus as “O God,” indicating that Jesus is indeed God. In Revelation, an angel instructed the apostle John to only worship God (Revelation 19:10). Several times in Scripture Jesus receives worship (Matthew 2:11; 14:33; 28:9, 17; Luke 24:52; John 9:38). He never rebukes people for worshiping Him. If Jesus were not God, He would have told people to not worship Him, just as the angel in Revelation did. There are many other passages of Scripture that argue for Jesus’ deity. The most important reason that Jesus has to be God is that, if He is not God, His death would not have been sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2). A created being, which Jesus would be if He were not God, could not pay the infinite penalty required for sin against an infinite God. Only God could pay such an infinite penalty. Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected, proving His victory over sin and death.",0,0,Spicy Quark,8eFlAY0D0ho,0.18541666666666665,2018-09-13 17:53:35,False,False

For example I am an Atheist but when I want a better understanding of what a Christian believes I ask a Christian or go to a Christian website, it wouldn't make sense to consult an Atheist website, why do Christians not do the same ? This also goes hand in hand with science, if you want to learn about evolution and decide for yourself then ask a Scientist or consult an actual biology website. Reading an Atheist website will not automatically make you an Atheist reading a biology website will not automatically make you a believer of Evolution. I can promise you one thing however, you will have a better understanding of the something and be more equip to discuss it by going to the source.   *So why bring this up at all?* Well that is where all Gods not Dead movies failed, they made this insanely rare Atheist straw man when the movie could have been the same but have the Atheist characters act like normal people.

It’s like me asking why you hate the tooth fairy because you don’t believe it exists.. one of the main reasons I left Christianity was because of this.. because of how simplistic other Christians minds were and observing how they give wrong answers to questions all the time.. I observed countless intellectual errors amongst them so it led me down the road of doubt like “if they’re this ignorant about simple things, why on earth would I believe them when it comes to Christianity or a God??”  This planted the seed.. their stupidity is what did it for me.. it allowed me to open my mind and realize other things like the fact that people wrote the Bible and it’s nothing more than claims that can’t be demonstrated and how indoctrination works..
