I hope they go a bit further with his character and who he is because they could probably create a whole other movie around his tactical history and the stuff he's been involved in.  Brolin's character is easy to understand and there's no mystery there, he's really just a necessary CIA figure, but that mustache glasses guy, that dickhead goes around burying people, but we don't know how dirty his hands are, only that he's our government's tip of the spear.
