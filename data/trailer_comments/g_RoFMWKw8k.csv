The film would very likely be a cult-classic had it not sky-rocketed in popularity so quickly. People expected a lot more when they went to see it and ended up walking out frustrated and wondering what they just paid to watch. But yes, it made a lot of money for such a small film, too, and I believe that's why the studios have been trying to cash in on that original and magical concept.

Only a small percentage of people had the internet, and it was an indie film, so people didn't know for sure it was fake.   It was being marketed as found footage, and they started a grass roots campaign to make people think it was real. The campaign was pretty effective early on. By the time the film was bought by a major production company and hit mass release, the gag was out.  The fact that it didn't have special effects made it seem real. The fact that there wasn't anything visibly super natural made people think it was real. By the time it was known to be a hoax, then people ragged on the lack of those things, but that's what made the hoax believable.  I saw the original in an early screening before the gag was out. People in the theater were truly frightened; I mean REALLY scared. It was a very cool experience that I don't think movie goers in the post internet age will ever experience again.
