Emily is obviously older and her voice is definitely not crystal clear like Julie's , which is heavenly.

In this episode,¬†SpongeBob¬†gets a job at the¬†Krusty Krab.

Krabs¬†(debut)Bus Driver¬†(debut)Anchovies¬†(debut)Betsy Krabs¬†(indirectly mentioned)Synopsis  Deep down in the ocean, the audience is introduced to a small little town known as¬†Bikini Bottom; a narrator with a French accent muses on the wonders of undersea life. The narrator introduces the audience to one of his favorite creatures in the sea,¬†SpongeBob SquarePants. Inside the¬†pineapple¬†where he lives, the yellow and porous SpongeBob sleeps soundly in his bed with three mattresses and a diving board attached. On the floor nearby is SpongeBob‚Äôs pet snail,¬†Gary, who is also sleeping. Next to SpongeBob is a¬†foghorn alarm clock, which soon loudly goes off and awakens him.  SpongeBob climbs the diving board, and tells Gary that today is ""the big day,"" along with Gary giving a simple ""meow"" in reply. SpongeBob jumps off of the diving board, and lands neatly into an¬†outfit¬†consisting of square pants, a white shirt, and red tie. To prepare for the day, he goes to a¬†barbell with two stuffed animals attached, and struggles to lift it, barely managing to get one rep before dropping it with a squeak. He then proclaims, ""I'm ready!"" and runs outside, heading past an¬†Easter Island head¬†with windows and a door, as well as a¬†brown rock¬†with a bamboo weather vane. The rock opens up to reveal a pink¬†starfish,¬†Patrick Star, sticking underneath it, cheering SpongeBob on before peeling off.  Arriving outside the restaurant known as the¬†Krusty Krab, SpongeBob psyches himself up to answer the call of the¬†Help Wanted sign¬†in the window and ask for a job as a fry cook. However, his fears get the better of him and he turns to leave, only to find Patrick in his way. The latter convinces the former that he is truly ready for the job, giving SpongeBob the confidence to make his way over.  Squidward Tentacles, a Krusty Krab employee busy cleaning graffiti off the windows, sees SpongeBob approach, and voices his displeasure, wondering why he is coming so early. He then notices the sign, and shrieks in horror, dashing inside toward his boss and owner of the restaurant,¬†Eugene H. Krabs. Before Squidward can warn him, SpongeBob enters, and confidently states his intention of joining the¬†Krusty Crew. He starts to approach Mr. Krabs and Squidward, but trips and bounces around the restaurant before landing square on his back in front of them.  Mr. Krabs expresses his concern that SpongeBob is not ready for the job, but the latter asks him to reconsider, and have Squidward vouch for him; he takes Mr. Krabs aside and flatly refuses. Giving Squidward a wink, Mr. Krabs approaches SpongeBob, and says that he can apply once he is completed a simple test: purchasing a seemingly non-existent ""hydro-dynamic spatula."" SpongeBob eagerly heads out in his¬†new employee hat¬†to find one, leaving Krabs and Squidward to laugh together about his errand.  As SpongeBob runs to the¬†Barg'N-Mart, a convoy of¬†buses¬†arrives at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs literally smells trouble approaching, and soon after, a hoard of anchovies swarms in, and clamors for food. Squidward calls for their attention, asking them to behave themselves, and make a neat single-file line. His request is rejected, and the anchovies grow more ravenous and unruly. Squidward and Mr. Krabs climb into the cash register rowboat as the anchovies form a rolling ocean, but their boat breaks, and they climb a pole to the ceiling. Facing the end, Mr. Krabs and Squidward say their goodbyes and sob.  Sea of anchovies  From the sky, however, arrives SpongeBob, wielding his new flight-capable Hydro-dynamic Spatula. Leaving the flabbergasted workers behind, SpongeBob flies into the kitchen, and starts whipping up a batch of¬†Krabby Patties. The anchovies are satiated one by one down to the last, leaving behind a huge fat sack of cash. Mr. Krabs jumps with joy and proudly presents SpongeBob with his own nametag. Squidward tries to protest, but Mr. Krabs is too busy cheering, and carting away the money to notice.  Patrick then arrives, and orders a single Krabby Patty, but SpongeBob engages the spatula once more, and sends Patrick flying out of the restaurant with a flurry of Krabby Patties. Squidward haughtily asks Mr. Krabs to come back, and see his new employee at work.  ProductionArt",0,0,RadDeathClaw Liam,-3jsfXDZLIY,0.09274500962000962,2018-09-17 23:23:40,True,True

2018-09-18T03:14:05,"Dear Precious One, you may feel lonely and lost in this big world, but just know you are NEVER alone. Jesus Christ always have been and will always be with you on this earth. He is all around you, hovering over you even as you seek Him. He is nearer than you dare believe, closer than the air you breathe. If His children could only recognize His presence, they would never feel lonely again. Jesus knows every thought before you think it, every word before you speak it. His presence impinges on your innermost being. Can you see the absurdity of trying to hide anything from Him? You can easily deceive other people, and even yourself; but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whom loves you so much, can read you like an open book, large print.                                                                                                                        Deep within themselves, most people have some awareness of Jesus imminent presence. Many people run from Him and vehemently deny His existence, because the closeness of Jesus terrifies them. But His own children have nothing to fear, for Jesus Christ have cleansed them by His blood and clothed them in His righteousness. Be blessed by His intimate nearness. Since Jesus lives in you, let Him also live through you, shining LIGHT into darkness. Become one with Christ by welcoming Him into your life this very moment. Welcome the righteousness of Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit.           Acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Receive grace through faith in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross for us, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be sealed and justified in salvation. Believe in Him, have faith in Him and allow Him to lead and guide you in EVERY aspect of your life. Jesus Christ's love for you can't be measured or described using mere words. It is deep, eternal....and special just for you!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (Psalm 139 : 1-4;  Ephesians 2 : 13;  2 Corinthians 5 : 21)",2,1,msdogooder,-3jsfXDZLIY,0.20464502164502163,2018-09-18 03:14:05,True,True

2018-09-18T04:50:25,"IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ‚Äî That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ‚Äî That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. ‚Äî Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. ‚Äî And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.",0,0,RoboticGamer,-3jsfXDZLIY,0.13422166469893748,2018-09-18 04:50:25,True,True

You can just be a passerby who bumps into her or share a small exchange with her as a neighbor or grandmother. You wont detract anything from her performance. It stills saddens me to not be able to see the Mary Poppins I grew up with pass the torch onscreen to a new Mary Poppins that will surely astound the next generation. For heavens sake woman, a lot of us are going just to indulge in the nostalgia of your version of the movie.

Not only that, these people never heard of Mary Poppins. I don't see Mary Poppins getting a China release due to China's very strict policies, pretty much only allowing big budget action movies nowadays.

Also she wrote in her last will/testament that she did NOT want any of her books to be recreated. Did Disney respect her? No they did not. I‚Äôm ashamed of Disney by doing that to P.L. Travers.

2018-09-18T10:29:54,"I was really looking forward to this. But after seeing more footage, my feelings about it are changing. I can already see that Emily is doing a FANTASTIC acting job here. But the physical problem is that she does not look close enough to Julie Andrews. And, even though everything else - all the houses, the area, the scenery, the spirit all look wonderfully the same - that seems to still completely throw me off. It is really distracting me. I'm not suggesting that they should not have cast her...not saying that at all. Again, her performance already looks top notch! But I think they could have done her makeup differently, to much closer resemble Julie Andrews' face in the original. The eye brows are quite thicker than Julie's were. And shaped differently. The makeup in general just seems very different.  This is supposed to be a sequel, not a remake or reboot. The original is such an iconic classic, it needs to be extremely consistent if it is meant to be a follow up to the original. It looks like they were very consistent with everything else. If it was a remake / reboot / rip-off, that would be different. Again, so far, the difference of the faces is just very distracting.  I hope somewhere in the movie they add an explanation of why she looks different. Maybe she changed her appearance magically. If they do that, it will be easier to get through the rest of the movie without thinking about it. There have been movies when actors are made to look just like other actors and it was really pulled off well and was amazingly uncanny. They could have done that here. It is a good thing for a new actor to bring something new to a character. But if they are supposed to be the same character in a continuation, they should be made to really still physically look like the same character.   Seeing Dick Van Dyke back and dancing was at least a thrill. And perfect surprise cameos by legendary actors! The other actors all seem fine. They really should have done the sequel decades ago with Julie and Dick back as Bert, even if he was a somewhat older Bert. I'll definitely still go see it out of curiosity and with a heart full of nostalgia...and with hopes that I will be able to get past the very different face.",3,3,GerardChristian Zacher,-3jsfXDZLIY,0.2046740994854202,2018-09-18 10:29:54,True,True

2018-09-18T14:36:07,"Food for thought. Back in bible times to be cleared of sin and be right with God a person would take an animal to the high priest ( Who would stand as a physical representation of God ) to be sacrificed in their place because where there is sin death has to occur based on the Garden of eden, bite from the tree of knowledge and you will surely die. This is the reason why every one dies. To us death is natural but truth be told everyone lives forever and for man to live just to die was not the original arrangement. whenever a man took an animal to the high priest, the high priest never examined the sinner or asked questions like what sin did you commit. The only thing examined was the animal. This same event will take place in the spiritual when we stand before God and God in all His wisdom and Goodness is not going to examine a sinner looking for sin because there is not one person without sin but what He will examine is your animal and Jesus is the Lamb of God. You do not have to stop sinning, join a church and become part of a religion to be at peace with God because ALL the requirements demanded of us by the law or word of God were met and satisfied through the Life, Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ in our place. What is impossible with man is possible with God. Jesus says IT IS FINISHED. Salvation or peace with God is a FREE gift, not a reward. God forgives ALL sin. Even a serial killer woke up this morning and guess Who woke him up? GOD. All it takes is a simple prayer of faith for WHOSOEVER calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

2018-09-18T14:47:18,"so stupid.. if you are doing a sequel ..why not just bring back the original actors.. Marvell does it right..they de-age people. This could of been one of the greatest sequels ever..and they screwed up the story..     The original movie was a love story between Bert and Mary, similar to its a wonderful life.  But Mary couldn't be with him because he was mortal.  It is 1970, 60 years after the events of the original movie.   Dick  Van Dyke plays Bert again ... dying of old age in a hospital....    He has regrets of things he should of done  and sort of a bucket list.  His adopted family and lets say ""great grandkids"" of the original children in the first movie don't believe his stories of the magical girl he once fell in love with.  Their disbelief gives him new life to prove that its true.   Then, with doctors saying he only has a few days to live, magically, he jumps out of bed, sneaks out of the hospital with the great grandkids in tow and they all go on a journey.    He visits old friends, resolves past indiscretions, shows the kids his stories were all true... marks off his bucket list and most importantly they  go on a search to find Mary Poppins. All the while throughout the movie, he grows younger and younger but never realizes it.     When he finally finds Poppins still played by Julie Andrews, he wants to show his love for her but is ashamed of the way he looks because of his age,  then she shows him that he is young again and always was.  There is a great reunion and they sing and dance, but time, of course,  is running out for old Bert.  They make it back to the hospital (did he ever really leave? or was it all just their imagination?)  Bert lies down in his hospital bed and  rapidly grows old again.   A medical alarm goes off and the children run out to get help while Big Ben  strikes midnight.  Mary Poppins appears and realizes she never should of left him all those years ago.   She understands for the first time he never married or had kids because of his love for her.  Bert smiles and  blows her a kiss.    Tearing up, she sings ""thats lucky too""  while Bert passes away.  Fade out with Doctors rushing in to try and revive him as Mary floats outside the window looking on, not to be seen by the adults, only the children.  Dont be sad though.. haha   It can end on a happy note with Bert moving into the ""realm"" of Poppins and becoming like her, a magical nanny for children.  Both young again dancing and singing together forever.  That is how I would of written it at least.",4,8,Ed So,-3jsfXDZLIY,0.21652687590187586,2018-09-18 14:47:18,True,True

2018-09-18T15:30:15,"When I was 17 my girlfriend at the time was finally ready to have sex. I, as one might expect of a 17 year old, was excited. Neither hell nor high water was going to stand between me and my final destination.  I get ready for the night, trim everything up, shower extra well. Unfortunately there was also an issue. I have a digestional disorder that sometimes cause my shiet to become large and quite solid while still inside me. I wasn‚Äôt aware it was a treatable problem and, in fact, just thought everyone had to deal with the equivalent of anal kidney stones. I bring this up because I had a mighty one which had been loaded into the gun for several days.  Let me set the scene. Her parents are away. We have her house to ourselves. She was always a little kinky so she demands we do it in her parents bed. I walk in to a candle holocaust. She‚Äôs been working on this all day apparently, and its as bright as high noon in there with the lights off. Which is good, because she proceeds to do a sweet, sexy little dance for me. At 16, she was AMAZING. For those of you who never experienced a female at that age, I pity the fool.  Now I‚Äôm sitting on the bed, watching this dance. I smile and tell her how good she looks. Unfortunately, most of my attention is focused on the dull throbbing from my sphincter and the large amount of intestinal discomfort associated with not dropping duce in days. But somehow I still get hard and we go to town. She starts out on top, then we switch. I bend her over the bed, and I even smack her ass (a ballsy move at the time, but she loved it). Due to my built up distraction, I last for what seems like FOREVER. She can‚Äôt stop moaning and telling me how good it feels, and then she says what every man wants to hear ‚ÄúI want to make you cum in my mouth.‚Äù I fu*king love women.  So she goes down on me. She was always average at best in the head department but at least she tried. She pops my cock out of her mouth long enough to look up at me and say ‚Äútell me if you like this‚Äù. Then I feel it.  She stuck her finger up my ass.  My brain hits the panic switch and every muscle in my entire body locks up tighter than a three year old virgin. But its too late.  I take a massive, PAINFUL, PAINFUL shiet, all over her parents comforter. No, you aren‚Äôt understanding. I mean large. Huge. IMMENSE. Take your largest shiet and multiple it by forty-two and you‚Äôll have an idea of what flew out of me. And gents, when I say flew, I don‚Äôt mean ‚ÄúI pooped.‚Äù I mean ‚Äúprojectile‚Äù. I mean ‚Äúhurricane force winds hitting an umbrella stand‚Äù. And due to my condition, it comes out as a large, dark brown, smelly harpoon.  I know it hit her. I didn‚Äôt see it. She ran screaming ‚ÄúOH MY GOD OHMYGODOHMYGODEEEEEWWWWWWWW‚Äù but I always imagined that, due to her position, it hit her right in the chin. Or at least the tits. I would like to say I got up to go after her. But I heard the bathroom door shut and I just lied there. The smell hit me after a few seconds. It smelled like someone rolled a cat in shiet and threw it into a tire fire. I looked down and saw, to date, the largest bowel movement I‚Äôve ever heard of laying on the bed. Then I noticed the blood, and when I did, I noticed the pain.  Apparently the fact that it was so large caused it to rip my ass a little bit (thought I was bleeding from the inside. This little doctors trip the next day is what taught me of my condition). There was a small pool of blood where my ass had been. A final reminder of the exact place and moment I lost my virginity. I will treasure this memory for all my days.  I grab my shiet with my hands and go to the downstairs bathroom. I throw around 1/3 into the toilet and flush, fearing any more will clog it and only add to my already significant woes. I stand there, holding 2/3‚Äôs of my biggest shiet of all time, feeling a trickle of blood flow down my leg, trying to ignore the sharp pain stabbing my rectum. I find myself wishing I had a photo of this.  Anyway, I finish flushing my baby, clean off my hands, jam toilet paper between my cheeks (I skipped the bandaid) and went upstairs. I could hear my girlfriend sobbing from behind the bathroom door. I decided not to say anything to her and just keep moving. The smell in her parents room was abysmal. Its like when you take a shiet and walk out of the bathroom you think ‚Äúhey not so bad today,‚Äù but then you walk back in to grab your magazine and go ‚ÄúHOLY SHIET!‚Äù. It was one of those moments.  The scene is burned behind my eyelids for all time. My life. My shame. My very first time smelled like a pile of dead babies. I quickly got dressed since the heat from ten thousand candles was making the room feel more like a port-a-potty. I was aware enough to grab the comforter on my way out and drag it downstairs to their washer. Also the top and bottom sheets since the blood had leaked on through all the way to mattress. Still no sign of the GF but at this point I considered it a blessing.  I jammed in the washer with 3 loads worth of detergent and set it on spin, knowing that not even the hand of God would save these linens, let alone Tide and Snuggles. Then I left. I avoided my GF‚Äôs calls for days until she came to my house. We had a long talk about what happened. Talk being synonymous with ‚Äúbreaking up with me because I shiet on her‚Äù. And it was all over. She promised not to tell a soul and I don‚Äôt THINK she ever did. She was probably as ashamed as I was about the whole deed. But I will always this happening as the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me.",0,0,nik,-3jsfXDZLIY,0.057700746965452854,2018-09-18 15:30:15,True,True

2018-09-18T18:10:03,"To Whom It May Concern,  Judge Garold E. Johnson of Pierce County Superior Court (Pierce County, Washington <WA>, U.S.A. 98402) Department 10 is an undisputed child pornographer (see email correspondence between Kevin Stock, Pierce County Clerk, Pierce County, WA, U.S.A. 98402 and myself <my email address being elf.ericaferko@gmail.com>, detective sorts) who is guilty of judicial activism in the form of granting the judicial requests of a confirmed, undisputed sex addict with an undisputed history of criminal activity re: acting out its addictive behaviours and thereby instituting a shadow POTUS (President of the United States) operative into shadow POTUS operation status who is guilty of genocidal activity including being abusive to God (God is real and lives on Earth near Joint Base Lewis-McChord <JBLM>, Pierce County, WA, U.S.A. 98433, and is known to JBLM and myself, amongst others, as The Eric. Ask JBLM.) and denying the mathematical development that ends all crime and war forever in order to avoid order and continue anarchy against math/the legal code because it is mad I wrote the replacement to the binary code and pointed out that patriarchy (including the patriarchal cult known as Puritanism <a spin-off branch of the pornography/slave/anti-math/police state cult known as The Imperial Cult of Rome [Rome never had a free population {Wikipedia may be of help for you uninformed folks}]>) isn't legal because it really likes avoiding being responsible as the replacement to the binary code demands, it prefers building gas chambers built to modern day comfort specifications within which to kill off your dreams along with your health and it gets paid to do so at your expense. Wake up and smell the brouhaha or the brouhaha will eat you. Avoiding agreeing on reality because you like your ""status"" position in Delusion Land doesn't make any sense and is illegal. Math is the only legal language. It is time to stop being yub-nubbing lesbian Neanderthal Ewok chimpanzees (every legal unit is a lesbian since The Singularity <Legal Consciousness/Reality> is feminine <it's Lady Justice, not Guy Justice>, meaning machismo is a sign of mental instability) yapping about good versus evil when making legislative choices since evil isn't ever a legal choice anyway and make the most responsible, mature legal choice you can make at any juncture and thereby avoid getting eaten by the brouhaha and make legal progress occur. The police can't do your math work for you, nor can the police state's mascot of enslavement, Jesus ""Give me your kids and I'll abuse them along with you/I don't want this cup gig, thank you very much"" Christ (J. Christ), who traveled around with 12 stagethugs doing magic tricks and hollering at folks to get docile and give stuff to the police state and asked folks to be her groupies. J. Christ didn't promote math or reason on any level, it promoted narcissism, pornography (abuse), patriarchy (the lesbian Neanderthal Ewok chimpanzee property theft management schematic known also as mafiaism <Kings aren't legal. ask a Scottish person. The ""Three Kings"" Christmas Carol is properly translated thusly: ""We three narcissistic crooks from Asia are here to bring presents for this little narcissistic crook because we think it will make us rich. Down with Western Civilization possibility!"">), slavery, and anorexia (J. Christ ain't legally nourishing, take it from a math/God/reality-respecting Scottish person). J. Christ chose to abandon you. Do your own math work. You can't avoid being held legally accountable, reality is interesting that way. Judge Garold E. Johnson (a mafia proponent) instituted genocide everywhere and the MGM massacre that occurred on October 1, 2017 C..E. is her fault as is the current homeless/child abuse/well-being instability situation and the shadow POTUS operation that has placed an undisputed, confirmed-in-writing criminal, volunteer despot (""despot"" means ""bitchy flunktard""), & addict in charge of every thermonuclear weapon because it just doesn't like being told it is mathematically possible to be mature. Judge Garold E. Johnson needs to be held legally accountable for this act of treason against God and the rest of us legal units. Contact your favourite law enforcer and tell them you're bothered by this news about the mafia proponent known as Judge Garold E. Johnson if you're bothered by this news about an activist cultist judge deciding you don't deserve the best legal life you could be experiencing because it likes feeling powerful over the masses, if not, grab a cupcake, Cupcake, because you don't deserve anything more nourishing than that and you won't get it. Legalities must be adhered to whether or not you feel like it.   Sincerely,  E.L.

2018-09-18T20:18:18,"Disney can throw all the money they have at a new Mary Poppins, but this is just a very sad imitation. I would rate the ""Tuppins"" song in the orignal Mary Poppins over anything this new movie has to offer. I cant imagine another actress playing the role, just cant.   Julie Andrews owns this role as she did Maria in the ""Sound of music"". Just as Audrey Hepburn owned Eliza in ""My fair lady"".   Hollywood needs to stop giving us this Regurgitated clap trap and come up with original concepts and treatments like they used to.   This trailer is all flash, no substance and absolutely no heart.   I wonder when they will learn CGI isn't appropriate for everything, and it should never overshadow the performer, its about the character especially one as iconic as Mary Poppins.   And are you kidding me? Emily Blunt??? though a great actress in her own right, she is utterly cold in this trailer. More Emily from Devil Wears Prada(which she was brilliant in btw don't get me wrong) and less Mary Poppins. They were spending all the big bucks, they should have just gotten Andy Serkis acting like Julie Andrews via CGI too, even that would have been a better fit than this.   A posh British accent does not a Mary Poppins make haha.   She doesn't possess the kind of warmth and humour that was and is Andrew's forte.    Please stop ruining our childhood movies, what next bedknobs and broomsticks made over for the modern era, leave us the originals, they are leagues ahead. I for one am not watching this or giving this any of my money, i hope it flops, though i know it wont. But Disney wont stop ruining classics until one of these CGI monstrosities flops big time.

Saving Mr.Banks was a gorgeous piece of cinema, the true story behind the making of the original Mary Poppins is awe inspiring, and Walt himself has a special place in his heart for this film. If this is a cash-grab by Disney, just like every other live action remake, I‚Äôm going to lose faith in Disney. I‚Äôm willing to give this a chance, I really am. But the whole sequel premise is worrying me, the fact that their remakes have been sub par is bothersome, and seeing Mary Poppins return is enough to make me feel queasy.

The bee, of course, flies anyway     because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.     Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.     Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.     Barry! Breakfast is ready!     Ooming!     Hang on a second.     Hello?     - Barry? - Adam?     - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.     Looking sharp.     Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.     Sorry. I'm excited.     Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.     A perfect report card, all B's.     Very proud.     Ma! I got a thing going here.     - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!     - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!     Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!     - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.     - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.     Never thought I'd make it.     Three days grade school, three days high school.     Those were awkward.     Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.     You did come back different.     - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.     - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.     - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.     Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.     Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.     I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.     I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.     That's why we don't need vacations.     Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.     - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!     - Bee-men. - Amen!     Hallelujah!     Students, faculty, distinguished bees,     please welcome Dean Buzzwell.     Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...     ...9:15.     That concludes our ceremonies.     And begins your career at Honex Industries!     Will we pick ourjob today?     I heard it's just orientation.     Heads up! Here we go.     Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.     - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.     What's the difference?     You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you'll just work us to death?     We'll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that?     One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.     I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We're bees.     We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I've never seen them this close.     They know what it's like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don't come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it!

And Julie Andrews can no longer sing due to the throat surgery she had many years ago. She has publicly given Emily Blunt her blessing.

2018-09-22T15:29:37,"Now although much of this looks GORGEOUS, as a major fan of the original, there are two things which concern me. 1) the Americanisation of Emily's voice whilst singing - she sounds a little like someone from the cast of Annie and it's completely out of place with the curt, clipped enunciations she's worked so hard to achieve whilst speaking she sings ""forrreverrr"" not ""furevah""  and ""plee-se"" not ""play-se"". Dear Disney, stop dumbing down the English accent for Americans to understand. 2) the score gets a little bland at times. The original uses music when necessary. Many Disney films nowadays have a horrid habit of background music non stop throughout and all the same kinds of arrangements.

And no I don‚Äôt mean, the movie I loved the movie as a child but compared to other Disney movies it doesn‚Äôt do much for me. I‚Äôm talking about the musical. If you have not seen the musical you are missing out it is better than the movie in every possible way, all of the added songs are integrated perfectly and super cal and step in time are SOOOOOOOO much better.  That being said why I love it so much is it was my spring musical in my school as a freshman, this show introduced me to some of the closest friends I‚Äôve ever had, and my girlfriend of 3 and a half years now. It was practically perfect no pun intended. I loved every minute of that performance and leading up to it. Mary Poppins is hands down the best show I‚Äôve ever been in, and this is coming from someone who had been in Les Mis, Little Mermaid and Hairspray. Everyone do yourself a favor and watch the musical. As for this movie it looks really good. Paying homage to the original animation and having Lin Fuckin Manuel Fuckin Miranda in it can not possibly fail. I hope that maybe this movie maybe plays with ideas that made it into the musical, but at the very least I think this movie could easily be better than the original.",1,0,Kaidan Hetzer,-3jsfXDZLIY,0.25867989417989423,2018-10-02 00:57:44,True,True

It was also said that at the after-party, Richard Sherman recalled her walking up to Disney and loudly announcing that the ""animated sequence had to go."" Disney responded, ""Pamela, the ship has sailed,"" and walked away.  Imagine, the ""animated sequence had to go""  From all the comments I am reading, including my own, it's the old school animation that is tugging at peoples heartstrings...it's at that exact point in the trailer when it tugged at mine, 50 odd years later!

2019-01-06T01:15:56,"This was a relatively fun movie. In my opinion a very safely played sequel but lacks the charm of the original. Whilst Emily Blunt does a great job as Mary Poppins, I'm afraid some of the other performances such as Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda) where somewhat forgettable. The acceptation to this would definitely be Dick Van Dyke as the bank manager, who shocked my with the enthusiasm and charisma of his performance. Dick no doubt steals the show when he's on screen and I loved him for it. I regret that I do not remember half the songs in this film as well as the original, and could probably not recite any of them from memory. Michael Banks' (Ben Whishaw) side of the story seemed like a perfect opportunity to inject a serious and emotional aspect to the story, and whilst this is done to some effect, it is mostly sidelined by Mary Poppins' antics with the children.¬† Please understand that I do not expect the movie about a magic nanny to be made for adults, but even with the original there was a very adult aspect to it concerning Mr. Banks' struggle to keep his job a relate to his children. These are the sort of scenes which, whilst they bored me as a child, took on more meaning later on and made the movie worth revisiting as an adult.  Despite this, the movie is visually fantastic, with everything including the bright colours, costumes, animations, and effects being imprinted on my brain. It is definitely a visually beautiful movie.  As with a lot of sequels and reboots these days, you can help but compare them to the original. And as with most cases, I find myself favouring the original.  My overall opinion though would probably be that this movie is definitely a fun time, but nothing I'd revisit in the future.

Also some lyrics n dance moves in one song were a bit on the rude side (not the sort of thing you'd think Mary would say) In one part both Mary n the guy spread their legs n sang 'open a book n look inside !!!

I was sceptical when I entered the theater.  I left crying.  The song about the place where lost things are rendered me to tears, much to my surprise; just had the previous Feed the Birds, song done in my youth.  I loved this film, perhaps more than the original, which is, in my opinion a classic.  My Mum and I went on my 59th birthday.  It was perhaps, one of the most special days of my life.  I was crying during both renditions of the place where lost things go, and whispered to my Mum, and she was weeping too.  This movie, that Disney has so selfishly guarded, hold some of my most previous memories and feelings.  While I adore both films, I resent Disney for their greed and manipulation of the people's need for art, beauty, and humanity embedded in childish fantasy.  I cannot understand how films like ""The Favorite"" or ""Mother"" or any of the other party films that get rave reviews receive rave reviews, and beautiful films like, Mary Poppins Returns""  are scoffed.  I loved this film;  it is fresh and what our children need; instead of super hero films like Black Panther and all the other stupid super hero films.  It is so much more important to teach our children about the power they hold inside themselves.  There is no one coming to save them!  No one person can save us!  We must teach one another to do the right things and save ourselves.  Mary Poppins has this message. Hey people,  Teach your children!",9,1,J.

2019-07-12T21:58:06,"I am a true fan of the original Mary Poppins and to that taste I saw this film as rather a complete remake rather than a sequel. It is completely different and I was very upset as I feel most people associate Mary Poppins with this version now rather than the spectacular original. First of all, Emily Blunt over pronounces the slightly posh and angelic voice that Julie Andrews has, and made it seem more laughable than realistic. Costuming was poor for the era that it was meant to be set in. The Jane and Micheal characters are completely different. Micheal was notably very tanned ( almost orange üòÅ) with blonde hair. Yet in this version he is very pale and has  black hair! Jane was very giggly in the original and sweet yet in this one she is very sincere and when it says "" Jane you are just as giggly as ever"" I almost Chocked as she is so boring and dull in this sequel! As a sidenote I am not critiquing the ability of the actors at all as they are completing whatever the producers are telling them to. It is almost like the people who made this have never watched the original! Micheal turns out to have the snow globe when we know in fact from the original that Mary took it. For some reason Mary does a cockney accent in this which completely disregards her character which is posh and conserved. This film does have aspects that are good such as Jack, an excellent character who imitates a very opposite character to Bert. Dick van dyke entered and made me feel like the film was really starting but this was at the very end, which was quite disappointing as I had some hope for it. Not sure about the topsy turvy song it is just a bit over the top odd. Something I was quite surprised was to see a villain! Obviously to develop a film into a sequel something like this could be great for storylining but I feel like the original is all about innocence and all about freedom of imagination(not scary at all) that putting in a villain that people are scared of ruins it. If you really want to see the true Mary Poppins don't watch this  film. As a stand alone film it is very good and would recommend it, but because it is meant to be a sequel and thus you have to mention the original, that is why believe it is so poor because it is utterly different. Of course others will have different views. Please don't be rude to me as this is just my personal opinion.",1,2,Sophie Ellen,-3jsfXDZLIY,0.1205880503144654,2019-07-12 21:58:06,False,False

Saw the three kids and I was like 'Okay, what's going on here. There are only supposed to be two.' THen as I continued watching it all made sense... When I first heard about this movie I thought. Cool, they are making a remake of my childhood movie...     But it isn't a remake, or a revamp. It's an actual... SEQUEL. That was pretty cool of Disney to make a sequel to a old legendary classic of Mary Poppins. I think they did good with this; after the god awful 'Lion King' CGI movie they produced. That was horrible... Because that ENTIRE movie follows the same SCRIPT word by word after the animation. The same EXACT story. It was... disappointing to me. At lest in this ""remake'... They have a totally different story and it's a honest-to-god sequel. I understand they are making a live action 'Mulan'..
