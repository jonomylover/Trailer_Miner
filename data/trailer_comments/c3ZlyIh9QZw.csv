Granted, Beatrix Potter has some elements that could be considered a product of its time, so modernizing it a bit to be more relevant is fine, but you can do it without sucking out everything that made the characters and world so charming (""Paddington"" found a good balance if I remember correctly).

Then I see this, hoping it'll be subtle, innocent, sophisticated and charming while teaching morals. My inner child is outraged.  And they fucked up by NOT getting James Cromwell to play Mr. McGregor. He would have been perfect -- the polar opposite to his kindly farmer in Babe. Instead they cast some spineless nebbish that will eventually team up with the animals to save his farm/get the girl etc. Why make him sympathetic? To shoehorn in a love story we don't need?  And apparently Mr. Tod is now an ally that parties with Peter? Rather than the diabolical yet charming villain who brawls with Tommy Brock?

Sure, being a kids movie doesn't mean it's exempt from criticism, but I'm 100% sure that kids won't automatically pull out their pens and notebooks, and try to analyse what's good and bad about this movie. They likely won't extensively talk about the comedic timing, how immature the jokes were, and say ""This ruined my childhood!"" They will likely just sit in the movie theatre, watch it, and most likely enjoy it. And as long as kids like it, than the creators have done their job, and entertained their target audience.

2019-06-22T05:53:22,"I'm seeing a lot of people comment ""You can't complain too much about these films, they're for kids"", I have to counter argue this defence with these points:   1) The term ""It's a kids' movie"" can defend why a film isn't too violent or why it has a colourful art style, but it shouldn't be used to explain why a film is bad, children's films aren't immune from criticism and ""It's a Kids' movie"" isn't a license for a film to be lazy or uncreative.   2) The Default acceptable standard for children's movies shouldn't be ""Whatever, it'll do, it's for kids"", especially when there's so many children's movies out there that are both emotionally challenging and imaginative, from ""Toy Story"" to ""The Secret of NIMH"", ""Matilda"" to ""The Neverending Story"", there's no excuses for children's films to get away with being insultingly low standard or unambitious.    3) Children aren't the only audience who watch these films, don't forget that parents have to see them too, why should it be a chore or punishment for them? Give them an experience that they can appreciate with their kids, a bonding opportunity that they can sincerely share.   Great children's movies respect their young audience, they don't underestimate what kids can take in as an audience, they believe that kids are smarter than we think and try to teach them to understand storytelling values, they are so well written & produced that they can be treasured for a lifetime. Let's not shrug our shoulders or turn the other cheek when a film for kids is bad, we need to call them out on their low standards or easy pandering, because the next generation deserve movies that treat them with respect and don't just see them as a money making opportunity.",0,0,Unicorn Bunny,c3ZlyIh9QZw,0.03134920634920637,2019-06-22 05:53:22,False,False

It's clearly trying to be extremely over-the-top and cartoony, so I'm pretty making this a *cartoon* would work much better. (Especially since this was made by an *animation* company, and the source material was animated.)",0,0,Dave Kendall,c3ZlyIh9QZw,0.07,2019-09-10 07:38:31,False,False
