Step Four: The story has dark elements, but is still magical and fun... but more EPIC!  Step Five: Familar music the audience knows, whether classic Disney or pop... but more EPIC as the trailer progresses!  Step Six: get big name actors and show all their names at the end of the trailer.  AND THERE YOU GO!

2017-12-19T20:19:14,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, visually this looks AMAZING and I TOTALLY am going to see it. But I‚Äôm really miffed at how COMPLETELY inaccurate this is going to be to the original story! Yes, in the original story does have Clara visit and interact with the Land of Sweets/Toys (actually, her name was Marie in the story but that Ballet changed it to Clara for some reason), but the thing is that she does it AFTER the Nutcracker comes to life and defeats the Mouse King! This preview doesn‚Äôt show any of that! It just looks like she‚Äôs doing an ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland‚Äù thing. This is NOTHING like the original tale. It doesn‚Äôt even show her receiving the Nutcracker! And another thing, so far all the films I‚Äôve seen that are theatrical adaptations of the story never really go into Nutcrackers backstory (with the exception of the animated ‚ÄúNutcracker Prince‚Äù). NUTCRACKER WASN‚ÄôT JUST A TOY BUT A YOUNG MAN (couple years older than her, as is usually the case at the authors time) THAT WAS CURSED BY THE MOUSE KINGS MOTHER TO BE A NUTCRACKER! Why was he cursed? Little something that the ballet has always overlooked. Turns out he angered the Mouse Queen because he broke a curse of ugliness she cast on a princess (that made the Princess‚Äô human features almost like a nutcracker but she was still human). Why was the princess cursed? Because of a feud between the Princess‚Äô spoiled, foolish father and the Mouse Queen. But when the princess saw what became of her savior, the girl heartlessly rejected him. And so Hans (his name was Hans) must stay a Nutcracker until he can defeat Mouse King and win the heart of a beautiful young maiden. Thus Hans‚Äô Uncle Drosselmeyer takes him home and eventually he takes Nutcracker to Clara when she‚Äôs old enough and THEN everything else happens! Clara absolutely loves the doll but then her rambunctious brother breaks him by accident. She binds Nutcracker with her ribbon so that he‚Äôs still in one piece until Drosselmeyer can properly fix him (because Drosselmeyer is an expert clockmaker and can easily fix broken toys) and later that night is the first night where she witnesses the battle between the Seven Headed Mouse King and Nutcracker. Unfortunately , it‚Äôs a losing battle until Clara gets involved and throws her shoe at Mouse King (she isn‚Äôt toy size yet like the ballet always portrays). But then she passes out because in the skirmish of the whole battle, she‚Äôs backed up too hard against a glass cabinet and gets cut by the shattered glass. She wakes up to everyone telling her it‚Äôs just a dream but she refuses to believe that. Drosselmeyer brings in Nutcracker, all fixed up and ready to crack nuts again and tells her how he came to be a Nutcracker. And then there‚Äôs a whole chapter or two where Mouse King, angry for her hitting him with her shoe, is forcing her to sacrifice her nice Christmas gifts and sweets (girl has a big sweet tooth) in order to save Nutcracker from his wrath while the doll is still recovering from Christmas nights battle (the whole story is told through a period of days, if not a few weeks). Plus there‚Äôs the stress of her family not believing the fantastical things she‚Äôs witnessed and when Nutcracker has finally defeated the seven headed Mouse, Nutcracker shows her his Kingdom. But the story isn‚Äôt over yet because when she wakes up the morning after ALL THAT, she‚Äôs home in her room and everyone thinks she just dreamed it all up and she should come back to reality. But her faith and love in dear Nutcracker never falters and when she finally proclaims it out loud is the curse broken and she can be with him as a human and rule over the Land of Sweets alongside him. Nutcracker isn‚Äôt just a whimsical ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland‚Äù story, neither is it a ‚ÄúBeauty in the Beast‚Äù story. It‚Äôs all of those things, and more. It is about faith and true love and coming of age. And please don‚Äôt say that they are giving Clara this heroine role for the sake of making her a role model because she already IS! The Nutcracker isn‚Äôt just some ‚Äúprince saves the damsel in distress‚Äù thing, there is an equal amount of saving between both parties. Clara has an active role in saving the Nutcracker Prince both in his battle with the Mouse King AND in breaking the spell he‚Äôs under just as much as He has a role in protecting her from danger as well.",7,4,Ronny Borrelli,2ktuvx9hrMw,0.08038793103448279,2017-12-19 20:19:14,True,True

2017-12-20T08:39:58,"Resistance¬†fighters led by General¬†Leia Organa¬†evacuate their base when a¬†First Orderfleet arrives. Following an effective but costly counterattack led by¬†Poe Dameron, the Resistance vessels jump into hyperspace to escape, but the First Order follows using a tracking device.¬†Kylo Ren, Leia's son, destroys the Resistance support fighters, but hesitates to fire at the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother's presence.¬†TIE fightersdestroy the bridge of the ship, killing several Resistance leaders and incapacitating Leia, leaving¬†Vice Admiral Holdo¬†in command. Disapproving of Holdo's passive strategy, Poe,¬†Finn,¬†BB-8, and mechanic¬†Rose Tico¬†embark on a secret plan to disable the tracking device.  Meanwhile,¬†Rey¬†has arrived on remote¬†Ahch-To¬†with¬†Chewbacca¬†and¬†R2-D2¬†aboard the¬†Millennium Falcon¬†to recruit¬†Luke Skywalker¬†to the Resistance. Disillusioned by the failures of the Jedi, Luke initially refuses, even after learning of¬†Han Solo's death. Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey and Kylo begin communicating with each other through telepathic visions. Prompted by R2-D2, Luke eventually agrees to teach Rey the ways of¬†the Force. Luke and Kylo give Rey differing accounts of the incident that turned Kylo to the dark side, with Luke confessing that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that¬†Supreme Leader Snoke¬†had corrupted him, causing Kylo to destroy Luke's emergent Jedi Order in retaliation. Convinced that Kylo can still be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To to confront Kylo without Luke. Luke prepares to burn down the Ahch-To Jedi temple and library, but he encounters¬†Yoda's Force ghost, who destroys the temple himself and encourages Luke to learn from his failure.  Holdo reveals her plan to discreetly evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transports. Believing her actions to be cowardly and risky, Poe instigates a mutiny. Finn, Rose and BB-8 travel to Canto Bight and acquire the help of the hacker¬†DJ, who says he is able to help them disable the tracking device. They infiltrate Snoke's ship, but are captured by¬†Captain Phasma, though BB-8 manages to escape. Meanwhile, Rey lands on the ship, and Kylo brings her to Snoke, who reveals that he controlled the mental connection between her and Kylo as part of a plan to destroy Luke. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and works together with Rey to kill Snoke's guards. Kylo invites Rey to rule the galaxy with him, but Rey refuses. Using the Force, they struggle for possession of¬†Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber, which splits in two.  A recovered Leia stuns Poe, allowing the evacuation to begin. Holdo remains on the ship to mislead Snoke's fleet as all others attempt to flee to a nearby old¬†Rebel Alliancebase on¬†Crait. However, DJ reveals the Resistance's plan to the First Order, and the evacuation transports are targeted with heavy losses; Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming Snoke's fleet at lightspeed to stop the barrage. Rey escapes in the chaos, while Kylo declares himself new Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose, who escape after defeating Captain Phasma, and join the survivors of the evacuation on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose lead a charge with old¬†speeders. Rey draws the TIE fighters away with the¬†Falcon, while Rose saves Finn from a suicide run against the main enemy cannon, which blasts a hole in the Resistance fortress.  Luke appears and confronts Kylo alone so that the surviving Resistance fighters can escape. Kylo orders the First Order forces to fire on Luke to no effect, then engages Luke in battle himself. Kylo strikes Luke twice with his lightsaber, only to learn that he has been fighting Luke's Force¬†projection. Luke defiantly tells Kylo that he will not be the last Jedi, while Rey uses the Force to help the remaining Resistance fighters escape via the¬†Falcon. Back on Ahch-To, an exhausted Luke peacefully dies and becomes one with the Force. Leia reassures everyone that the rebellion has all that is needed to rise again. On Canto Bight, one of the children that helped Finn and Rose escape grabs a broom with the Force and gazes hopefully up into space.",0,0,James Har_en's free throw attempts,2ktuvx9hrMw,0.0883107389686337,2017-12-20 08:39:58,True,True

The Hoffnan story has no Sugar Plum Fairy (Keira Knightley) or Mother Ginger (Hellen Mirren), but the ballet does. Admittedly, neither ""character"" actually contributes to the plot in any way. I have no idea what the hell this movie is supposed to be.  Also, I really dislike this trend in film music nowadays to add taiko drums and blasting horns to everything.

Also The Nutcracker is one of my favorite things ever. I‚Äôm an aspiring writer and have always wanted to write my own story based off it but included darker themes. But with Tim Burton here, I feel like he‚Äôs sort of doing his usual schtick with the dramatic Danny Elfman soundtrack and the over the top sets and costumes. It works sometimes, especially in his stop-motion films, but I don‚Äôt think it works with public domain stories so well. You can definitely darken a classic story without giving it a Hot Topic aesthetic. That said, I am one for films that are visually interesting. And there aren‚Äôt so many nutcracker films that aren‚Äôt just for kids. I love Kiera Knightly with her tough but classy performance from Pirates of the Caribbean, and Morgan Freeman does all he can to give himself a good on-screen presence.

And this is all based on the trailers they've released. It seems, to me, uninspired and unoriginal. I don't understand why the Nutcracker we know and love has to be changed. What was wrong with it? Why even put ""Nutcracker"" in the title? You could call it ""Clara and the Four Realms"" and nothing would be changed. The only thing you'd lose is a recognizable pop culture marketing tool.

2018-09-04T12:32:13,"Who said black plp ain't come from eroupe   In the third century CE, there was a Roman army detachment stationed near the western end of Hadrian‚Äôs Wall, at Aballava (now¬†Burgh by Sands,¬†in Cumbria). The detachment included the Numerus Maurorum Aurelianorum‚Äîmeaning, more or less, the Aurelian infantry troop of Mauri. Here‚Äôs an inscription that mentions them:¬†RIB 2042. Altar dedicated to Jupiter Optimus Maximus and to the Divinities of the two Emperors and the Genius Numeri¬†.  The Mauri were from Mauretania‚Äînot the modern country, but the Roman province, which was more or less equivalent to Morocco. They might have looked like these Mauri cavalrymen, depicted on Trajan‚Äôs Column, fighting the Dacians in the second century:  Ôøº  Whether you consider them ‚Äúblack Africans‚Äù. . . is probably a loaded question. The Mauri are often identified as relatives of today‚Äôs¬†Berbers, who are not a genetically homogeneous group. How much ancestry the Numerus Maurorum shared with sub-Saharan African populations is unknown‚Äîso far, we know they were there from inscriptions, but as yet no skeletal remains have been found that would allow us to test their DNA. (And DNA testing can‚Äôt assign a person to ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù categories; human genetics is much messier and more nuanced than that.)  Still, at the very least, you can say that Aballava was manned by a bunch of infantrymen with pretty dark complexions. If they looked like the Mauretanian cavalry shown on Trajan‚Äôs Column, they had awesome dreadlocks. (Source:¬†Black Romans) And if they were like infantry in most times and places, they would have left, shall we say, genetic traces in the surrounding population. . .  There were plenty of other Mauri in Roman times who would have been in southern Europe‚Äîlike¬†Lusius Quietus, the commander of those cavalry, who fought the Dacians (in modern Romania) and who also fought in Parthia and Judaea. The early Christian leaders¬†Tertullian¬†and¬†Augustine of Hippo¬†were also from North Africa, albeit assimilated to Roman culture and with some degree of Roman ancestry. So was Emperor¬†Septimius Severus. (EDIT:¬†So was at least one Pope:¬†Pope Miltiades¬†came from North Africa and was allegedly of Berber descent.) Mauri troops were stationed along the eastern borders of the Empire‚Äîand some of them ended up quite a long way from home indeed.  There‚Äôs also a fourth-century CE grave that was excavated at York, England. . . the occupant was a high-status lady, who died around the age of 20 and was buried with rich grave goods, including ivory bracelets and fine glassware. Turns out she was African. I haven‚Äôt seen any mention of attempts to sample DNA from her bones, but stable isotopes in her bones show that she wasn‚Äôt from around York, but was raised in a warmer climate, and the shape of her skull suggests at least part African ancestry. She wasn‚Äôt the only one‚Äîthere have been some British finds, of things like Roman-period cookware, that were locally made, but in African styles. Roman-era Britain may have been much more ethnically mixed than it‚Äôs been given credit for. (Source:¬†African origin of Roman York's rich lady with the ivory bangle.

I just wish these people would reflect on why it matters so much to them that the Nutcracker be kept white, and yet how they probably don't bat an eye when originally non-white roles are cast with white actors.  Also gonna mention at that comment about ""why are there black people and indians in my nutcracker"", that for one this is a fantasy realm and for two, the original ballet had entire numbers dedicated to rewarding Claire with sweets from around the world as a celebration of the Mouse King's demise. Although there IS the issue of the original ballet also having white dancers use blackface during some of these numbers but that's a whole other post I'm not gonna get into.   My point is that having a more diverse cast is actually more true to it's origins than an all-white one, and that if you have problems with black characters being at the forefront of this movie then you should get over your issues.

In modern films, at least take someone, but you don‚Äôt need to take the one who was clearly not in that country at that time. Russia has never been a racist country, but in the 19th century there were no Africans in Russia and in Europe as a whole. In Asian historical films or cartoons you will not see white or black and this is normal since then they were not there in history and this is not racism.

2019-12-27T01:01:22,"The movie was ok, it was enjoyable and fun to watch. But on a more technical point of view, I think they tried to copy Tim Burtons 2010 Alice In Wonderland, it's way too similar, Clara is exactly like Alice and the plots are almost the same. I've watched that Alice movie a bunch of times and some of the shots and scenes looked exactly like scenes from that Alice movie. It's just Alice In Wonderland in Christmas. Not horrible, pretty fun and enjoyable if you ignore this but quite disappointing because I wish Disney would just try to be original, they have potential, but if they keep milking their classics Disney is going to have a huge downfall eventually and they're going to only be a distant memory of something that was once good.
