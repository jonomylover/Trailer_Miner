I mean if this was done by somebody else I may not complain but this is Pixar the originator of all these fantastic stories and Cars just sounds kinda silly. There was actually a time when I did like Cars but after seeing Cars 2 I started to realize that it was kinda ridiculous. Now I just recently saw the first movie on tv and to its credit it's not too bad. I mean I didn't care for the characters the same way I care for any of the other Pixar characters from better movies but it did have its moments though no real funny laughs, it was pretty laid back and too be fair I did actually kinda like the ending. It had a little heart. Cars 2 was kinda silly with the whole spy genre and I was just too distracted by everything having a face even the battleships and planes. So when it was announced that Cars 3 was being made I decided to myself that this was the Pixar movie I was gonna skip but after Seeing the dramatic teaser I will admit it caught my attention a little.
