Why do people have to emphasize race as being the main issue of this movie?  McFarland High School won a state cross country championship with that team and eventually, became a cross country powerhouse who competed against much bigger schools for the majority of their season. Race had nothing to do with it! Someone, in this case it was a coach, noticed that a group of kids had a talent for running and decided to help them do something productive with their talent. The result was that a group of young kids, who happened to be Hispanic, won a state cross country championship despite so many odds and obstacles going against them.
