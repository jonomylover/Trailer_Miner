2020-05-17T22:49:15,"I honestly don't understand the people who didn't like the movie. Actually, I was so impressed by it wanted to come and see more comments and content where I found some people have negative opinions. I don't know what's happening in the world, you guys are craving for superheroes but not real ones who overcome their fear for the ones they love. This movie depicts the essence of motherhood. She was scared for her life at every moment yet took the rational decision and fought back! I think for as far as we've seen a female protagonist over the last few years, this stays at the top! You could read all the emotions on her face, e.g. when approaching and showing teeth just like the animals do and keeping conscious after being hit from a car and probably had her nose broken. The only critique I have for the movie is where it wasn't connected was the moment the male kidnapper crashed and walked with the child to steal a new car. At that point, there was the exchange and the kid was given to the female one; however, it didn't make sense in the timeline of the movie, therefore the most reasonable place for the kid to be was in the stolen car's trunk. I guess for plot purpose they extended the movie after that, having introduced the other stolen children but that was the only place that could use improvement in my opinion.",0,0,Trayan Hristov,l2DP5I5HO_k,0.1306818181818182,2020-05-17 22:49:15,False,False
