2016-07-18T17:01:58,"The 1954 original movie was Akira Kurosawa's epic ""The Seven Samurai"", which was a superb film, groundbreaking in many ways (the scene in so many Westerns where the Indians come over a hill? Kurosawa!)  It was multifaceted, featuring characters with depth, morality, charisma and martial skill.  Toshiro Mifune, who plays comic relief, is brilliant. Some (many?) of the actors were also Kendo masters, so when you see them engaged in swordplay, it is the real deal.  The 1960 John Sturges remake was a piece of shallow crap, with a ""yee haw!"" script, two dimensional characters, and a lack of plot that happens when you take a 3h27m story and try to cram it into 2h8m. I felt genuine loss when characters died in The Seven Samurai, I found The Magnificent 7 to be boring and hackneyed.  Now they've remade the remake, with more fatalities, explosions, and random violence, even less plot and character development, and whoever did that ""music"" (Kanye, Kendrick, I don't care, just try something appropriate to the period).  Oh, and when Hailey Bennet says ""I want righteousness... but I'll settle for revenge""?  Yeah, bullshit.  Righteous(ness) is a title bestowed upon you by others, you can't ""ask for it"".  Revenge is what you seek.  The word she SHOULD have used was ""justice"" (or ""retaliation"" or ""retribution"" or ""rice crispies"") any of them would have made more sense than ""righteousness"".

Then I saw the cast and my next feelings were excitement and anticipation to see if they could get close to the 1960 classic , A film that is one of my all time favourites.  The story doesn't stray too far from the original . Instead of Mexican bandits being the enemy . this time it's a mining tycoon and his men. The Seven are a little more multicultural too. We have Denzel Washington playing the Yul Brenner part , Ethan Hawke as the Robert Vaughn character and Chris Pratt playing the Steve McQueen role. There is also a native American Indian , a Mexican and Korean knife thrower. Despite the varied characters on show they all work really well together and you definitely care what happens to them. There is lots of great action as you would expect and none of the violence is gratuitous . My only gripe is that they didn't use the famous Elmer Bernstein soundtrack until the final credits .I think they missed a trick there.  So the big question is , is it as good as the original ? The answer is no but it's still a solid two hours of pure entertainment. MY RATING -  8 out of 10",1,0,redvalleyjohn,q-RBA0xoaWU,0.18373809523809523,2016-09-29 19:41:12,False,True

Many fled to the West for freedom and better lively hoods. At this exact same time period the US-Mexican American War started with the US trying to take over the west and basically stealing Mexico's land. At the same time period Native Americans inhabited the land. Asians were brought during this exact same time period to build the railroads. Asian women where brought in as prostitutes during the ""Cowboy Era"". So yes the West was VERY VERY DIVERSE and still is today. This is why having the cast that they have was a job well done.

It's actually a much a better version than the 60's which stands out good, but they updated a little better. I enjoy the new cast and they look entertaining. Denzel Washington is clever as the leader of Seven outlaws and he's such a history. I would only take him as a clever actor than Will Smith any day. Chris Pratt is the best second man ever and he's charming and very badass at the same time. So does the rest and they did their roles good. The action scenes were fun, entertaining, and so much action that it is generic, but a good Western style like most films that are spaghetti western films. Overall, entertaining film ever.

It is not bad , it is not good, it is somehow mediocre and forgettable.   What worked in the movie were performances except Chris Pratt who felt like Chris Pratt in a western and not the character. They had some nice chemistry, back and forth exchange and they worked as the saviours. It looks good as filming locations really shine, it has decent production values and action is fun to watch. But that is it. It is nowhere near the material that Tarantino does with the genre, you have seen it all before, bad guy is so stereotypical to the point you can hear him exhale when he smokes cigar, some western cliches are inevitable i guess even here, you do not care unfortunately for anyone including the magnificent seven because they are underdeveloped and rushed into the story plus film lacks the emotional depth.

It knew how to give each of the seven men a strong and different personality without having them be different video game classes. There are many types of western movies (traditionnal, revisionist, spaghetti, zapata) and the golden age was from the late 1940s to the end of the 1960s. After that the western genre pretty much died, with a small revival in the 90s with Unforgiven and Tombstone, but they won't be the same, they don't have the same spirit today.  Good traditionnal westerns (with John Wayne and such): Rio Bravo, the Searchers, Warlock, High Noon, Red River, Magnificent Seven, Ride the high country, True Grit, the Sons of Katie Elder, El Dorado, etc  Good spaghetti westerns (from Italian directors): the Dollar trilogy, Once upon a time in the west, Duck you sucker, Death rides a horse  Among the Dollar Trilogy of course is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, which is perhaps today the best-known western, and western stereotypes of gun duels and all come a lot from this one.
