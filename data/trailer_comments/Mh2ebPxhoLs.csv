Also they brought up many things in the movie that they didn't really put too much detail or effort into it. Overall the movie was quite great, but he losses to a no name fighter and never redeems that loss and comes back to win against the guy who was involved in killing his wife. Also I was thinking he'd eventually tell Will he was the reason his wife died after they found out what happened with Hoppy's family. The movie could have also been resolved if he never started that brawl in the lobby, which was never mentioned again afterwards. Eminem had a good soundtrack that made the movie better. The movies overall plot was pretty predictable. The split decision loss also made no sense considering Hope was caught with a low blow and his opponent got a point deducted without a warning, so he would have loss the fight if I recall correctly. And the movies whole name revolves around Billy Hope switching his stance once in the fight just to catch his opponent with an uppercut in his southpaw stance and didn't finish the fight. I'd give this movie a 6/10. ",0,0,TheDark Raven,Mh2ebPxhoLs,0.278125,2015-07-30 20:12:33,False,True

He was feeling pain but what he really needed to understand was that, he needed to be strong for his daughter also because she too was feeling hurt and anger!

2015-09-25T15:03:14,There is no denying that the physical transformation Jake Gyllenhaal went through to play boxer Billy Hope was amazing. He is almost unrecognisable as the same man who played Louis Bloom in Nightcrawler . Sadly this film cannot hold a candle to that one . Having grown up watching and enjoying the Rocky films you would have thought i would have embraced this film but i didn't and that's simply because the boxing scenes were so terrible. With Rocky you expect the exaggerated punches and cartoon like action but with this i wanted more realistic sporting action. Sadly it almost bordered on comedic. The best bits of this film were definitely all outside the ring and even those were packed full of head shaking cliches.  This is film that promised so much but failed to pack any significant punches. 5 out of 10,0,0,redvalleyjohn,Mh2ebPxhoLs,0.04458333333333334,2015-09-25 15:03:14,False,True

What worked in the movie are performances, especially Gyllenhaal who was great in his role and supporting cast does terrific job although the daughter overacts but it is fine. It is a well directed film and solid entry to the boxing genre. Everything else failed in my opinion. Plot is way too contrived and derivative, come on Rocky 3 anyone, it gets way too heavy for its own good, it is filled with drama that i did not care for or connected emotionally with the characters, looks forced and shallow, there are huge plot holes, it is uninspiring, formulaic, predictable, overlong and it is simply tedious film. 2/5",0,0,ogorjefan,Mh2ebPxhoLs,0.07420634920634919,2015-11-17 15:18:01,False,False
