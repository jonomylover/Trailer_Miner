They spy on their own citizens TO PREVENT them from overthrowing the U.S government. You don't know the horrid stuff the NSA does did you known in 2013 they arrested an innocent American citizen because they believed he was planing to get some of his friends to go protest about how the government was doing wrong things. Do you know what they did to him they tourtered him he lost and eye in this and two fingers on his left hand they aren't protecting you but keeping you like caged animals brainwashed into believing what they say it's kind of sad.  I too am American. Right know at this moment there hunting snowden down just to kill him and erase all the documents he gave out to the PUBLIC that he shared of what horrid stuff they were doing so please before you go arguing just think for a moment just 1 minute of what they have done that's all I want from your time 1 minute.,0,0,Obey Zive,uMCgjrq1Ohk,0.19611992945326281,2015-07-18 16:26:29,True,True
