But perhaps it is the nostalgic kid in me that just can't help but feel like this is missing something. I know this is not a remake of the previous mummy movies, it is more a complete reboot with a new universe. But what I loved about the first two mummy movies at least was that sense of adventure, the mystery, the amazing chemistry of the cast and just the pure charm it had. And I don't like that they set it in current time instead of the 1920s as it had a lot to do with the sense of adventure it had. I don't get that feeling from this trailer, it seems to be way more serious and way darker.   But who knows, it might still be a great movie.

Not trying to be misogenistic but a female mummy with no love affection and just (presumably) a revenge plot is really lame.Literally copied and pasted the iconic lines and redubbed them in the most boring way possible as well.

You cant have the old testament without the new testament. Think about that.  Jesus is mentioned in the quaran and that was written centurys after the new testament which was written the first 100years after the death and resurrection of Christ.  The reason why they are witnesses is because they witnessed His resurrection. Hebrews 11:6 says its impossible to please God without faith. But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.Hebrews:11:6 Have faith in the unseen God. The only one who seen God is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. John:1:17-18 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father. John:6:44-46  Check out this video. Theres many more dubunking the story that Jesus is sun worship or the isis horus set story.  Satan wants to steal kill and destroy. Get you into idolatry. Take your faith away from the only one who can save you and give you peace. Neither is there salvation found in any other for there is no other name other heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. acts 4:12",0,0,24K 3691215,GzorZUuZqEI,-0.003847687400318974,2017-04-04 01:09:28,True,True

Ancient Egypt prior to Greek and Roman occupation was full of black African citizens as were the Pharaohs, carpenters, mathematicians, scientists etc. The Arab inhabitants of today arrived during the advent of Islam and slaughtered or bred out the majority of black North Africans. In the same way Europeans took over America and erased the Native Americans.   But find me a full Middle Eastern person who resembles anyone on those walls in Egypt.

2017-04-12T05:18:19,"Should the actress be black? Due to the shot of her looking at the great pyramids we could safely assume that this takes place after the Old Kingdom of Egypt, and the fact that every metal object is bronze (like how well preserved the sarcophagas is) it would be long before the Ptolemaic dynasty (European rulers, Macedonian to be precise) so she probably would be African, presumably, of course, since it's pretty damn hard to be sure about people that lived 5k years ago.   But how would she have looked, even if we know for sure that she's African, we have no clue really, since again it's really hard to reconstruct how ancient people look like. My guess is that the actress choice points to the most famous Egyptian female: Cleopetra VII, who of course is Macedonian in origin.  BUT, this is a film about how Egyptian mummies turn evil and fuck up shit, so i doubt that cultural sensitivity would be at the top of their concerns  And to be honest, this looks dumb, and not in a goofy funny way, but in a ""taking everything way too serious"" way, so im not paying to see it any time soon",0,1,SilveR's Channel,GzorZUuZqEI,0.10229885057471268,2017-04-12 05:18:19,True,True

The thing he's most known for is getting paid, which he did, and this steaming pile of egyptian excrement resulting from everyone's poor decisions is the result. This turd is so stinky that even at movie prices at least ten percent of paying customers walked out. If you want to combine a monster flick with a zombie flick and put tom cruise in the middle of it, you should have a workable script, not a haphazard mess filled with unlikable characters. I took it up the ass for a solid hour and couldn't take any more. If you want to watch this, bring the lube and a note from your psychiatrist just in case you bail and Tommie the turdmaker finds out.  This movie does for monster flicks what battlefield earth did for science fiction. tommie boy, here's hoping that you crash into that carrier deck real soon.  The director, Kurtzman, is a television guy at heart and he's been involved in some stinkers before, but this stinking shithole is going on his tombstone. If he didn't know about tommie's control freak contract, then he found on the first fucking day and he stuck with it so he shares the cruise control blame. Six writers were credited  for creating this steamer so you know at least fifteen writers worked on it and everyone has shit on their hands but the main culprit is our main man, tomas kiddlehopp cruise, who has finally gone off the deep end.
