2016-08-03T17:26:28,I never watch the original movie from the beginning. I believe the earliest part I recall was Masala visiting Judah Ben Hur at his house prior to the accident that threw the family into chaos. I did see the rest of it. The best scene was when Jesus recognized the man who offered him water when he fell under the weight of his cross as the slave to whom he had offered water many years ago. I hope they kept both parts of that in the new movie. It is crucial to the story as much as any mention of Jesus in the film. The other scene that must be kept is the miracle of cleansing as we see his shed blood touching the ground and flowing across it.,0,0,tenhirankei,df2VrzS1HCs,0.25863636363636366,2016-08-03 17:26:28,True,True

I always wanted a story where they didn't deify him, and this is one. He looks more like a man than a god, and I prefer him this way.
