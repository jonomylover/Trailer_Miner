I respect blacks browns whites etc equally and am offended by anyone who hates on someone just because of their skin color. It's just ridiculous. But I am going to say this..... TV and movies has become pathetic in the past decade when it comes to race. TV shows, movies, Lifetime movies, commercials, etc have all just gone completely overboard with their sense of equality and making their pathetic attempt at putting black people up on a pedestal. There isn't a commercial on TV these days that doesn't have an equal amount of white and black people with an asian thrown in for good measure. They have BET channel made just for the black race, and now we get ANNIE as a black girl? I'm sorry but this is beyond insulting to all races.  If there was a channel called 'White People's Entertainment' it wouldn't be on air for a week before they got slammed with a lawsuit. If Annie was originally black and this movie had her as a white girl, there would be so much criticism and hatred from black people. What if they brought back the Cosby Show but as a white family?? How would that sit with you?  Yes, okay? We get it. We're all equal. But they are taking this bullshit propaganda wayyyy too far! It's almost insulting to all races. And if you want my honest opinion, I think there are more racist black people in America today than white because they hold a grudge and have for centuries. I also think that a lot of black people feed off of racism for attention.  Everyone, especially Hollywood, needs to leave well enough alone and do things normally. This whole black Annie in the ghetto is just taking shit way too far and should certainly not be labeled as a remake to a classic movie that has shaped many childhoods.

2017-08-13T08:37:29,"Her being black isn't what I dislike - its thr fsct that it was done out of forced divercity nobody asked for shoved down our throats. All focus was put to showing off this so the rest of the movie and actors they picked for roles they don't fit (again out of divercity and fame status) made the movie shit. And totally bad compared to the original. Acting was bad and unfunny. But hey - at least famous, black Will Smith made it! Everyone who is a minority or famous can't be criticized, remember?But het - atleast ""muh divercity"" people will shut up for a few minutes right? You just can't make them satisfied. And of course they had to make white people look like bitching, bad and evil ""rulers"" in the movie. Oh I forgot- stereotypes are only bad when against minorities!",2,0,Nick M.,fyXHFPOvDSY,-0.14023053665910806,2017-08-13 08:37:29,False,False

2020-03-01T21:37:04,I don’t understand why people hate the ‘black’ Annie. This proves that how cruel this world is. The whole point of the movie was to make people think about adopting different types of kids yet people make them kids feel unwanted after watching the movie. I’m not saying this because I am black myself but because people say they don’t want to be racist but they are being very racist.,0,0,Jada —Cat Simulator Family,fyXHFPOvDSY,-0.1791666666666667,2020-03-01 21:37:04,False,False
