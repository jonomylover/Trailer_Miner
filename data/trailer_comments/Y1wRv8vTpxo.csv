I know these films are based off the Peter Pan book, but I can't help but think of Disney's Peter Pan animated film, when all these prequels start showing up.  Makes me wonder what makes Hook turn here. At least in The Pirate Fairy, Hook was still a pirate, and he wasn't good there. Here however, they have stuff about a prophesy, so even if Hook is good here, his fate cannot be changed, no doubt they're going to hint at Hook losing his hand, and becoming the captain.

Here's what I'm excited about: Instead of being absolutely silent or completely missing from the storyline, like most versions of Peter Pan I've seen (or omg this awful high school production that made her talk in this awfully racist vernacular and she was all lusty and clingy with Peter, it was disgusting).....in Wright's version, she not only speaks, she's a leader. She's a warrior. She gets to fight Blackbeard in the rigging of a ship. She isn't a damsel in distress. She's protecting her people. THAT IS WHAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT.

Just think of Anakin Skywalker from the first Star Wars movies or Lex Luthor or Doctor Doom. Lex Luthor was actually pretty happy and good before Superman came to Earth, of course it's different in the comics, Lex Luthor blames Superman for a failed weapons test where Lex Luthor gets all his hair burned off, but I digress. Doctor Doom just wants what's best for his people in Latveria. Anybody else know any other people who fit into this category? I just remembered, Harvey Dent from The Dark Knight.

2015-08-04T09:03:46,"Looks ok, but just the word ""prophecy"" god they are in every fantasy/scifi film now, it's simply lazy writing, there was no scrap of mention of a prophecy in the original book. Why can't they be a bit more creative with plots, Nostalgia Critic was right, everything these days now involves a prophecy; sometimes it works if there's a prophecy in the actual books ie Narnia, but Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland needlessly  had a prophecy when the original had no need for it, as well as it had no logic in the world of Wonderland. James Cameron's Avatar, for example, didn't require a prophecy for the whole plot to be driven, Jake's moral and emotional journey eventually concludes him to lead the Navi against the human alien invaders, which is more fascinating and emotionally investing than if he was doing to it just because people were telling him ""the prophecy says so"", and yeah there's a kind of back story where a Navi is supposed to ride the largest dragon thing- Taruk Makto- whatever it's called but that takes up a minor section. Here you have the start of Peter as he becomes Peter Pan. He's Peter freaking Pan! Why should he obey what the prophecy tells him to do, he's a child, a boy who is rebellious and does what he wants! For heavens sake he cuts off the hand of his adult nemesis Hook. How can we perceive that same character earlier on to do as a prophecy tells him to do? He's his own character, it'd be far more involving to see him make the decisions and in conflict that leads him to being Peter Pan himself through the cause and effect in his choice of interaction with others. Prophecy in a film equals lazy effort to me since we are not seeing the characters themselves drive the film since the writers want the story that way with no other explanation that ""it's what's in the prophecy"". Don't get me wrong this trailer looks incredible, by emphasis on looks, story wise however i doubt it because of the generic fantasy story using a prophecy and thus taking away a little life from the plot and a choice of will from the characters :(",0,0,AnotherCupofTea,Y1wRv8vTpxo,0.1428061224489796,2015-08-04 09:03:46,True,True

What makes this movie worse is that they portray it as a prequel...seriously if a production is going to make a prequel, at least make it somewhat accurate to J. Barrie's original story! And its not even creative! This is like a knock off Sci-fi movie Neverland, where Peter and Hook were friends. But hell at least that version had a NATIVE AMERICAN Tiger Lily and Peter Pan kept his clever and fun personality. And then how did Peter Pan get to neverland? Tinkerbell was the reason he could fly there!  What is up with these crappy retellings these days? The trend has to stop because it kills originality.  This movie is going to be the worse I've seen of the Peter Pan series. I hated Hook...but at least hook respected the original story.

2017-12-07T16:58:34,Many of us did grow up on the original and it is a story that will always be Loved by many generations. JM B created Peter Pan for his Lost boy childhood. And in doing so he did help and heal many other rejected lost children's childhoods. There has been many different kinds and remakes of Pan but they all are for the one main reason. Peter Pan the boy of 12 who lives forever and can fly. This one was flopped by many in the States and the UK by those who wanted this the same as the original animation all time family classic. They did not see know understand what us many rejected childhoods did. In this we find out who Peters parents are and how and why he can fly without fairies dust. This had more to it and JM Barrie would be very proud of this one because it had more in it. This was different but brilliant and did show us how Peter Pan came to be. This will go on like the animation classic.,1,0,Thomas McGready,Y1wRv8vTpxo,0.42386363636363633,2017-12-07 16:58:34,False,False

What makes this movie worse is that they portray it as a prequel...seriously if a production is going to make a prequel, at least make it somewhat accurate to J. Barrie's original story! And its not even creative! This is like a knock off Sci-fi movie Neverland, where Peter and Hook were friends. But hell at least that version had a NATIVE AMERICAN Tiger Lily and Peter Pan kept his clever and fun personality. And then how did Peter Pan get to neverland? Tinkerbell was the reason he could fly there!  What is up with these crappy retellings these days? The trend has to stop because it kills originality.  This movie is going to be the worse I've seen of the Peter Pan series. I hated Hook...but at least hook respected the original story.

2019-01-05T16:39:45,"(watched on TV today this is my review)  Disastrous such disconnection from the original JM Barrie masterpiece it is quiet bewildering why the film is not integral to being the prequel to the original story and why all the characters look like they're from different films. Captain Hook looks like he is Indiana Jones and tigerlily looks like she is from Glastonbury Festival.   the best interpretations of JM Barry's masterpiece are the Disney Peter Pan the film Hook which is in my opinion a masterpiece starring Dustin Hoffman Robin Williams Julia Roberts Maggie Smith and Bob Hoskins   The previous Peter Pan film was actually pretty good and pretty accurate in alignment to the original stories.  unless the director is planning on making a sequel to the pan movie than this has no merit as being known as the prequel.   a completely irrelevant film that introduces characters like Blackbeard that has no relevance to Peter Pan whatsoever and doesn't do much to explain the relationship between Peter and Captain Hook.   overall the film is a jumbled conceptual nightmare that doesn't give prevalence or explanation to the story of Peter Pan it's simply fuses together different concepts like Indiana Jones (Captain Hook) Blackbeard etc and tries to make a cohesive story which it certainly doesn't.  the film doesn't explore the core principles of Peter Pan ie not growing up, lost boys, Pan vs Hook, Wendy etc    Please reply back to this with your opinions",0,0,Awesome Metal Bands Official,Y1wRv8vTpxo,0.1272675736961451,2019-01-05 16:39:45,False,False
