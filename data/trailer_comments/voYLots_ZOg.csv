And I’m a guy who is not intimidated by women kicking butt.   [NOTE*: There’s definitely a double-standard especially with “InCel Fanboys”. For example in AVENGERS:ENDGAMEthere’s long footage of Thor, Captain America, & Iron Man taking turns beating the crap out of Thanos—poses, posturing and all. Then with the brief moment when the female superheroes got together to help Spiderman women-haters were calling it “cringe-worthy, pushing a feminist agenda, social justice warrior bullcrap, etc.”...WTF?!! There really is something palpably and visibly wrong going on in our society that supposedly “strong, secure men feel immediately threatened with notions and images of powerful women. Why is that?!
