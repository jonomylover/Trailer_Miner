2017-06-08T20:19:34,"ok so i have to vent this out. Coco is not ripping off the book of life. Pixar announced the making of this film years ago. There has been a history of pixar movies and other movies being undoubtedly similar (ants vs a bugs life anyone) In fact, a pixar film called ""Newts"" was cancelled and im pretty sure it had something to do with the fact it was so similar to Rio. I dont personally believe this has ever pixar's fault, and lets face it, of any similar movies pixar's has always been on top. You could see other companies take on the film, like it, see pixars and forget the other one even existed bc their movies are true art at their finest (lets not bring up cars 2). People claim that pixar copies other movies because they come out after the other movie. However, pixar spends an unimaginable amount of time on their films. It might take them months and months to create one scene and then redo it because they thought of something better. If you are a pixar theorist like me, you also know they think things through. Like its crazy the way pixar works if the pixar theory by jon negroni is true. Easter eggs are well arranged as is how the story contributes to the pixar timeline. Now, i liked the book of life, dont get me wrong. Maybe we should enjoy having two wonderful films, even if theyre similar.
