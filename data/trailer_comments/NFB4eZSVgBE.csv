And it looks like this one will make 90% of the same mistakes.  The outlying 10% is in regards to the fact that it is now an online video rather than a video tape.  Although this does mean that the movie will not be dated as quickly, and they can't just smash the internet like they could have, and should have done in the first movie.  (Seriously, the Characters it 'The Ring' are the dumbest in any horror movie ever).  The fact that it is online causes another large problem, however, and that is the number of people who will see the video.  Once the video is seen by enough people, and authorities link the deaths to the video, then word will be sent to the public that they will definitely die if they watch the video, then people will avoid it by the plague.  In the end, it could do more harm than good because once people know about Samara, then they can more easily avoid her evil video.   I wonder if they will actually answer the big question: Why is the girl evil?  Think about it, she was evil before her foster mother tried to drown her.  She was born evil, as is evidence by the fact that her birth mother tried to drown her.  Also, why is it that no one is capable of giving straight answers in these movies.  Think about it; there are times when the characters are supposed to have answers, but instead of giving them, they simply say some cryptic bullshit as if it is meant to explain everything.   Examples (albeit paraphrased): 'My wife was not meant to have a child'  'she never sleeps' what are these statements meant to explain?  They are stated in the first movie as it they are meant to make everything clear, but they are just creepy filler in actuality.
