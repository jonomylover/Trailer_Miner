I can ditto Elton John & David Bowie. Freddie Mercury's orientation was unknown (to me) at the time.  Ditto Elton & David.  The type of music I listened to was R&B going back to the early 1960's to this time period.  Disco, which I loved, came later. The concept of LGBTQ music didn't exist.  I never gave thought to that genre until the present.  Steve Grand, Years & Years, Brendan Stansell, Ria Mae are just some of the current musicians I've been buying CD's of. At age 70, I don't attend films especially that I use a walker plus going alone is no fun.  Should I want to see a movie, I wait until the DVD comes out - ""Love, Simon"" for instance.  The story line may be the impetus for me to purchase the DVD on release rather than the music.

2018-07-18T02:56:21,"Hey planet Earth üëΩüëæ I need your help... If you like feel good edm music then you might wanna read this... When life gets rough there's always that one thing we as humans can go back to and feel like everything is alright. In my opinion that thing is good music. There have been so many days before when I was younger where everything seemed so overwhelmingly negative... Like there was no light at the end of my tunnel. But then I started listening to my idols, marshmello and zedd included, and somehow it made me feel some sort of way... Almost like a hope entered into my life. At that moment I knew what my dream in life was.   I wanted to make music like my favorite artists. I knew I'd never be able to even afford a keyboard so it stayed a dream, buried deep inside me never to see the light of day. Until now that is. Here I am  few years later and I'm making the music I'd always look for but never could find. This journey in my life has been amazing... And I want to help people feel the same way by listening to the music I create... I wanna be able to make memories for other people. I want people to hear my music and let it change your day for the better! That's why I started making music. üååThey're not your typical dance tracks. My songs are flooded with emotion and vibes.   They're very spacey and futuristic. They make you feel like your life is part of something bigger, almost like your being whisked away to another galaxy... I'm not trying to boast. I'm just trying to help you all feel good vibes. And in 2018, I think alot more people need that. If you could help me out by checking my songs it would mean so much. I promise you won't regret it. Thank you for being one of my first fans if you choose to listen. üôè I'll forever remember the first people who supported me... <3",30,4,M V,mP0VHJYFOAU,0.2317528735632184,2018-07-18 02:56:21,True,True

The film's producers and lead star, Rami Malek, had grown tired of Bryan Singer's erratic behavior, which saw him routinely showing up late to set or disappearing altogether. In 2017, after Thanksgiving break, Singer disappeared from filming for three days straight, at which point cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel had to step in and direct during Singer's non-showings. Reports claimed that Singer left because of a family matter. A couple of days after this report, 20th Century Fox fired Singer from the film due to his erratic behavior on and off set and clashes with production personnel. Matters would get much worse for Singer as the next day, 20th Century Fox terminated his Bad Hat Harry production deal with the studio. Fox began canvassing for a new director to finish up production with two weeks of filming still remaining, all of post-production, and with potential reshoots.

2018-07-19T03:55:52,"This is a wonderful idea, but I hope to god this isn't another Mamma Mia in execution. Don't get me wrong, I love this band, but it might not work if all the songs are hamfisted in and abrupt. Also, if this is a musical, there's a major problem.  Singing out-of-plot (Like a lot of the songs in Mamma Mia) can work out with musicals, and it makes sense. They all suddenly sing, everyone can magically dance. I won't comment on the logistics of it all. But there are problems when you mix this with a band. Is the band singing IN the movie half the time or are they singing out of plot? Are we hearing a real performance that they're supposedly putting on, or are we hearing a classic out-of-plot song, and the setting of said song is in a concert hall?  This sounds dumb, yes, why would they be performing an out-of-plot song if they're a band in a movie? Well there are many ways this can happen.  Think back to The Greatest Showman, Never Enough. It was a generic pop song in a time when two people couldn't date if they were different races. I hope this movie doesn't do anything similar to that, but that's just one example of a mix up. That song, Never Enough, was being performed, but the question is, was it actually pop in the plot? Was the song she was singing just turned into pop for us to enjoy it? If it were pop in that time frame, it would not have worked at all. It was a very strange mix up.  What if there's a moment in this movie where they're not at a performance, but just at an event or something, and they start playing a song. Everyone dances, etc etc. Are we meant to believe that's a part of the plot, or it's just another song shoved in? It might just get confusing!

I experienced He-Man, Transformers, Back to the Future and so many other 80's and 90's icons growing up.   And yes, the first time I REALLY loved Queen, was when I was a young child and it was in Wayne's World in 1992, it became one of the coolest  bands I discovered as a child. My parents had grown up listening to classic rock, and as a teen in the mid to late 90's I was listening to classic rock my Dad loved from about the age of 13 or so.

2018-07-20T15:11:41,"Whilst I'm really looking forward to the film, I feel as if this trailer suggests the film focuses more on Brian May and Roger Taylor, whilst neglecting John Deacon. I mean, John only appears at the briefest moments and we literally never hear him speak, either in the teaser trailer or this one. Whereas, Brian is shown in this really positive and dramatic light, showing how he had the idea for 'We Will Rock You'. Roger is shown as a drama queen but in a really funny way, and both he and Brian's positive relationship with Freddie is made obvious. It's sad because John was said to have had a close friendship with Freddie also, to the point where he did not carry on with Queen after Freddie died, because he felt Queen was not the same without him. I just hope that despite Brian and Roger's supposed fractured relationship with John, and with the pair of them being so involved in the making of this movie, that they can still include John's contribution to the band.

2018-07-24T03:46:05,"Lots of Sacha Baron Cohen fans still arguing he would have been a better Freddie.  It's pointless to argue and try to change their minds - respect their opinions and move on.  Whether Cohen would have delivered a better acting performance than Malek in playing a believable Freddie, we may never know, but read these comments from the band members (google the quotes below to find the article, I'm not making this up):  *May, in an interview with Classic Rock magazine, also talked about why Cohen and the project parted company: ""We [the band] felt that his presence in the movie would be very distracting,"" referencing the star's ""outstanding performances in The Dictator, Les Miserables and Hugo as being ""very much Sacha Baron Cohen performances.""*  *Said May: ""And we thought there has to be no distraction in the Freddie movie. You have to really suspend that disbelief. The man who plays Freddie -- you have to really believe is Freddie. And we didn't feel that could really happen with Sacha.""*  Casting opinions from the band members themselves carry more weight than anybody else, yes? They've seen Cohen audition as Freddie, we haven't.  They personally knew Freddie, we didn't.  They know what works for them as Queen.  They are more qualified than anybody here to determine whether actor A, B, or C would be compelling as Freddie.  Let's just enjoy the movie in its entirety and argue less about who is playing Freddie.  If the movie is as amazing as these two trailers were, this movie will be huge!  It will be a movie that does justice to Queen.  It will be a movie that does justice to Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon... all of them at the same time!  This is the story of a graphic designer (who designed the ""Queen crest"", with an uncanny ability to engage an entire concert audience), an aspiring astrophysicist (who later returned and completed the PhD in 2007), an aspiring dentist (who was asked back in 1970 by Peter Gabriel to join Genesis but declined, paving the way for Phil Collins' career in Genesis), and an electrical engineer (who created the iconic Deacy Amp for Brian May's guitar sounds).    The story of Queen is amazing, yet tragic, yet inspring in the end, and I can't wait to see the movie!",11,1,rieyuki,mP0VHJYFOAU,0.2061607142857143,2018-07-24 03:46:05,True,True

We will rock you was released in 1977 in the album NEWS of the World...   Freddie‚Äôs Short Hair was in 1980   So we‚Äôre seeing 1980‚Äôs Freddie talking about making a song in 1977!

The trailer does suggest, however, that the movie will advance the idea that Queen were so ""out there "" that they faced an uphill struggle to have their music heard. But the truth is that many bands in that era were doing progressive experimtal music that was long and not exactly catchy for radio play. They all faced the same uphill struggle with music executives wanting pop songs. I'm talking about YES, Genesis, ELP, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, etc. They all drove the music industry crazy with their concepts and arrangements. Wasn't just Queen.

He had us all in the palm of his hand. Sometimes I just cant listen to Queen it just makes me too sad. I think I will go and see this on my own. I remember when he died man I wept.

I had never asked my stepdad to pull any strings before, regarding tickets to see bands, but my girlfriend, wanted to see them badly, as I did too. So after asking him the favor, a couple weeks later, he comes home, handing me a rectangular white box. When I opened it, their were two tickets, along with a card for back stage admittance. I about killed over. I told my girlfriend about the tickets, but held the backstage a secret. You should have seen her face, when I led her, by the hand to see the band. She almost started crying.

2018-10-18T03:45:59,"This is interesting because Rami Malek has made a lot of movies/tv shows that involve mind bending characters aka Mr Robot and Busters Mal Heart etc. Which Malek is a phenomenal actor but in BMH( Busters Mal Heart) I could not seem to figure it out, although I was very intrigued with the multiple twists. In Mr Robot I could not read the dialogue but I understood the main point. And for an actor to portray such dysfunctional characters like Elliot and Jonah( didn‚Äôt know if I spelled that right) is an incredibly astounding accomplishment. This seems different though, he is playing a complex character but not in a mental state. This is a rather happy and not so dramatic scenario ( except when he gets AIDS, which I‚Äôm pretty sure we all cried about) Aldo he has an uncanny resemblance to Mr Mercury, so I am very eager to see how this movie will go, even though I‚Äôm PRETTY sure it will win an Oscar for bring us to tears, happy and sad.",0,0,Lord Shaggy,mP0VHJYFOAU,0.23900226757369614,2018-10-18 03:45:59,True,True

This movie had me hooked from start to finish, with a few laughs along the way including tears and smiles . For me the story telling makes this movie,   and I was able to visually  appreciate the story of Freddie and Queen's recreation of live aid. The costumes were spot on,  and there really is a lot of incredible shots and  beautiful cinematography through out this film.

In the end they became a true powerhouse,  that no one can touch , and no one will ever be able to duplicate .  And as for  Freddie  ? You take a perfectionist , add a wee bit of eccentric, a heart and soul as large as the universe , mix well with the other members of the band,  and I think he is smiling and at peace knowing , that his music, and his work was understood .

2018-11-02T11:45:43,"Just watched the World Premiere yesterday in cinema in Macedonia. I've been waiting for it some time now anxious. Meanwhile watched almost every documentary i could find about Queen. Being 28y old i heard of Queen and listened their songs probably since 15y ago but i have never ever been so attached to their songs as in this past year. Playing them on repeat and whole playlists. Now seeing all of that, the documentaries and the story of Freddie and so on, due to how amazing this film is, i was in same time disappointed that in the film the timeline of the events are not really portrayed correctly.   Freddie coghs blood as early as 1983 and tells his band he has the aids before the Live Aid concert in 1985 which is not correct. He gets news about it in late 1986 or 1987 and tells his band in 1989 when they get back in Montreaux for the Innuendo album.   In that regard i expect bit more drama and more fitting timeline.   This way, although still somehow oddly fitting and nice, it wasnt just correct and accordingly dramatic.   Anyway i advise who havent to go and watch it because its great tribute for a great band!

I was waiting for that movie a long time, as I am a Queen and Freddy fan as well. The movie goes really fast and it gives a sense of a non-refined plot. Real facts, all the fans around the world know, go upside down or even just omitted from the movie. Some examples. The way Freddie met Mary Austin seems like they had already know each other. And if I am not wrong Freddy was introduced to Mary (or vice versa) by Brian, something that is not shown in the movie. Another ""wtf"" thing is that the director shows a very early success of the group (before ""A Night at the Opera year of 1975 which was the actual turning point forward to their success) by giving scenes of gigs with huge crowds even already being familiar with some of the bands then hits. A small detail: the song ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" is listened in the movie in the year of 1976 I think even if this was a Jazz album song, issued in 1979. Then the director suddenly jumps from 1976 to the moustache era of Freddy in 1980! No reference to the collaboration with David Bowie at all in making ""Under Pressure"" in 1981. No reference to the almost (but never) complete collaboration with Michael Jackson the same period. The top of the iceberg(the movie was indeed such a cold shower!) is that towards the end of the movie, little before the Live Aid performance there's a scene where Freddy calls the group back as they were dismissed after a rehearsal and tells them that he had AIDS!!! Absolute falsification of the truth. All the people being aware of Freddy's basic bio facts know that he didn't know of his HIV infection not earlier than the last 3-4 months of 1986. The fact that he may was concerned way longer about that doesn't change that fact and of course the fact that he didn't tell to anybody about his health issue before he was officially diagnosed. And a few days before Live Aid is way too far from that day. As an overall sense, despite the fact that the movie has some well-shooted scenes (especially the Live Aid reproduction) and Rami Malek plays his role pretty well (not perfect though in my opinion) at the end it's like the movie was targetting to a beginner of the whole Queen and F.M. story.",0,0,Œ¶anis Œ¶irstpriest,mP0VHJYFOAU,0.008650883838383836,2018-11-05 20:55:47,False,True

Film ini akan memperlihatkan warisan sebuah band yang selalu lebih seperti keluarga, dan yang terus menginspirasi pihak luar, para pemimpi dan pecinta musik hingga hari ini.  https://bioskopinfo.com/movie/bohemian-rhapsody-gik",1,0,Bedboy,mP0VHJYFOAU,0.06818181818181818,2018-11-06 20:08:56,False,True

In the beginning, Sacha Cohen was nominated but there was no interest in them and they broke the conversation, then Ben Whishaw, who is a very good actress in fact. The troika trio tried to say that. Singer's first ruler was a pedophile, caught by every aspect has been dropped here. As far as Brian is concerned, I have a lot to say about him. He is expecting from a Brian who shows sensational things from Freddie's life as his sick leg and Freddie's suffering before dying and such like this before releasing a book of his own or being both ridiculed by John Deacon and put out a hard article about him in the English tabloids? Or for Brian in the 90s he said we can not continue without Freddie and now says that Adam had `range` higher than Freddie and Freddie would be jealous of her? while not forgetting to mechanically wail a Freddie video at any concert they do with Adam's goblet? Freddie's birthday and Freddie's birthday did not share her but the movie. Freddie's ""Freddie to the bones on his expence."" do now have a `significant timing 'and is disgusting as an idea. Brian is the first, Roger his doll. both without character. good musicians but people who have lost their character or themselves for fam and money.

2018-11-25T13:43:48,"The problem I had with the film was that it wasn't chronologically accurate. For example, the party scene where he was dressed like the Queen I believe happened in 1986 for his 39th birthday party, not the early 80s.  but they introduced Hutton and made him say that Freddie needed to love himself before they reintroduce Hutton later in the film. I think they did that more to create some kind of a growth storyline. They portrayed Freddie mostly as a lost and lonely homosexual trying to find himself. It's fine to address that, but I think they surrounded that character for the whole film to create a storyline. I wanted Freddie to have a more positive persona than what was mostly highlighted. It just made his story a bit sad than he really was. It would help to see the glory of Freddie in his later years (heartbreaking time) and how he carried on through the illness w/ as much zeal and strength than ever before. But Queen story is quite long, and to be able to portray in depth the whole story of the real thorough process of the songs (it wasn't that easy), or Freddie's life as a whole, we'd be in the theaters all day.  I just hope it compels newer folks to Queen to dig more into the history of the band. I wonder how Roger and Brian liked their portrayals of them?

Squeezing the larger-than-life careers of four bohemians and their friends, families, and managers into 2 hours, adding the largest part of the best live gig in history as the climax.¬†It's a roller coaster ride, taking you up and bringing you down, with lots of hilarious fun and breathtaking drama. The movie captures you, from Brian's signature guitar solo in the very beginning (no annoying parade of stupid bumpers and cheaply produced leaders this time) to Freddy's ""Don't stop me now"" during the end credits. And I loved all the funny details, cameos, and references.  Yes, they did alter some facts and timelines. So what ? It's a condensed¬†story, but not a single bit more spectacular or outrageous than the reality. And no, i.m.h.o. they did not straight-wash Freddy.

Ero un ragazzino e Radio Ga Ga, leg√≤ le mie mani, il mio sentire ed il mio giovane cuore, per sempre, alle gesta delle 4 regine.  Il film, non solo non √® stato in grado di far pervenire al grande pubblico, la profondit√†  artistica e umana di Mercury, ma √® addirittura riuscito a sminuire sia il contenuto emozionale della leggendaria performance del Live Aid, sia di tutta la musica e la passione di cui trasudano le note ed ogni cantato di Freddy. Sceneggiatura a parte, con errori storico-temporali MACROSCOPICI, dove vabb√® lasciar licenza poetica e d‚Äôerrore, ma certe gaffe, sono proprio improponibili.  Dove i Queen, o quello che ne rimane (Bryan e Roger), ne escono zucchero filato dolcissimo, adatto anche ai pi√π piccini, e dove le poche ombre e bocconi indigesti della loro storia, cadono solo sulle spalle del povero Freddy.  I dialoghi del film sono didascalici e patetici, potrebbero andare bene per raccontare il nuovo matrimonio di Ridge e Broke (vedasi Beautiful), ma non per far conoscere la storia di un artista leggendario come Mercury.  Iconografia, retorica e una superficialit√† inaudita, questo √® ci√≤ che la gente vedr√† al cinema, o ci√≤ che ha gi√† visto.  La cosa pi√π grave √® che tutto questo √® opera di May e Taylor, autori di splendide canzoni e assoli musicali, ma che qui, hanno reso per intero evidente, che senza la conoscenza di Freddy,  negli anni 70, sarebbero rimasti come la neve che cade di questi tempi ...... superficiali ed effimeri.",0,0,Tittero Valleroni,mP0VHJYFOAU,0.2965909090909091,2018-12-19 14:57:43,False,True

After that, I watched a lot of documentaries trying to understand personalities, who Freddie was and where those songs where coming from and what they tried to say, and what I could learn from them. I always look for inspiration in songs.. Well, now, after 15 days from watching the movie, I can definitely say that probably we need much much more Freddie Mercury(ies) in this world... wonderful man before being a wonderful performer as he would say :) ... hey.. one last thing, now I know why of this huge success...

Nothing about that how exactly  Freddie did that collaboration with one of the greatest sopranos in the World-Montserrat Caball√© Nothing about that,how they start making music videos and Queen are one of the few pioneers in this area. Nothing about how they start learning music and take a private lessons or maybe ,,you"" think that if someone wants to play guitar,or drums or piano he only needs to grab a instrument and that's it. Or do you want to be leading vocal?No problemo.Just open your mouth and that's it. NO üëé You need hours and hours and hours practicing,taking a lessons and practicing again and again.

2019-03-13T11:11:02,"The movie is a Disney portrait off of Freddie Mercury and Queen.  The bands worst sin is not even mentioned in the film.   Biopics off real artists does not have a duty to be real. There for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is as much fantasy as it is a biography.  It is not possible to sum up a several decade long career in two hours without taking liberties.  For example, Queen never had any conflicts with a record label mogul by the name of ""Ray Foster"".  Freddie Mercury did not meet his boyfriend Jim Hutton as he was working as a waiter at his home. Hutton was a hair-stylist and they met at a nightclub.  Mercury did not know that he had HIV before the group did their legendary performance at Live Aid in 1985. He get to know it one or two years later.  In ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" Queen were on the verge of splitting up before the gigantic Live Aid benefit show for the hunger in Africa. Freddie wanted to go for a solo career and the other band members were feeling offended and did not speak to him. So the performance at Live Aid was a last minute call. The band is rusty and has to practice intensively before they lay the Arena Wembley in London under their tennis shoes.   Queen did indeed take a short break in 1983 after having been on tour constantly for over a decade. But they never lost contact with each other. In reality they released the album ""The Works"" the following year, went on tour with the album across the world and did their last gig eight weeks before Live Aid.   It was a well oiled live machine that stood in front of the cameras at Live Aid, not 4 broken down old mopeds.   Before Live Aid, Queen was also one of the worlds most controversial and critiqued rock band. In October of 1984 they had ignored the United Nations boycott and performed in Sun City. A golf and luxury resort as well as a propaganda tool for the racist Apartheid-regime in South Africa at the time.  Queen was not alone that chose money before morality. Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, and Status Quo among others have concerts in Sun City on their consciousness.  Live Aid did not only become a triumph for Queen. Many saw it also as a triumph for barefaced indecency.  One day Queen is performing for one of the worlds worst and inhumane regimes. The other day they are performing for starving children on a continent which has been ravaged by white colonists.  In the clean washed version of Queen which is being portrayed in the film Bohemian Rhapsody, that part of their history does not fit in.  Just as many other Rock Stars the surviving members of Queen did not stop to being  unscrupulous opportunists after Live Aid as well.  The 2000 's have participated in charity concerts ""46664"" with the objective of combating the spread of hiv and aids in Africa. 46664 was the activist and politician Nelson Mandela's prison number.",1,0,Tom Powers,mP0VHJYFOAU,0.039009139009139,2019-03-13 11:11:02,False,False

He tells me to move in a very rude way. I went a few rows down and started to cry. I was 15 and this man more than half my age made me cry. I was crying when the opening credits were going on.

I knew We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions, although I wasn't aware of the fact they were the ones who composed and performed it. Similarly, I knew how Bohemian Rhapsody (the song) sounded like, but I didn't know who composed it.    Even so, I was left in tears after finishing this movie. Tears of joy after watching a wonderful film and tears of sadness when I learned of Freddie's life and his passing away.  Therefore to me, this movie perfectly captures the spirit of Queen. Whether you were a newbie to rock n' roll or a huge fan of the genre, you were never left out. Everyone was welcome. Similarly, this movie made me feel included as a part of the band and Freddie's life, even though I didn't know anything about them.  The struggles they all had to go through, the creative process behind every song, everything.   I often joke with my friends that the Oscars are pointless because most of the movies that either win it or get nominated will only be watched once to see what the hype was all about. And then, that's it. No more buzz about the movie(s). But I'm really happy that the Oscars finally recognise rare jewels like this movie (and Get Out). I wish there will be more jewels like this movie in the Oscars. Sadly, I have a feeling that it will be a very long time before we can watch a masterpiece like this movie.

Under the influence of the powerful new psychedelic drug ‚ÄúRhapsody‚Äù, Mario Fantoccio discovers the existence of an invisible reality overlaying our own.

Everyone knew the words to every song and just about everyone was singing with him. Every song was a hit and he did at least 4 encores. It was the only concert I have ever been to where the band wore out the audience. We were all spent from singing along with Freddie.

His parents, Bomi (1908‚Äì2003) and Jer (1922‚Äì2016) Bulsara, were Parsis from the Gujarat, India. That is from the region of the Bombay Presidency province in British India and had origins in the city of Valsad in Gujarat. So he's was half Brit and half Indian. 'We Will Rock You' and 'We are the Champions' are still my favorites. Co-incidentally both Joseph Mazello and Rami Malek also starred and acted in The Pacific tv mini series (2010) directed by Spielberg.

2020-02-14T17:07:30,""" Number of deaths due to HIV/AIDSSituation and trends  Expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and a declining incidence of HIV infections have led to a steep fall globally in the number of adults and children dying from HIV-related causes. The estimated 770 000 [570 000‚àí1 100 000] people dying from HIV globally in 2018 were 56% fewer than in 2004 (the peak) and 33% fewer than in 2010 in spite of a period of substantial population growth in many high burden countries.  Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency. Countries need to live up to their commitment to end the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030 -- a target included in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015. The immediate challenge is to reach the Fast-Track targets for 2020, as HIV-related deaths are still unacceptably high.  The 2020 targets include reducing the number of people dying from HIV-related causes to fewer than 500 000. Based on current estimates, this provides an opportunity to prevent almost 300 000 deaths per year.  The drop in HIV-related mortality is especially evident in the regions with the greatest burden of HIV infection, including the WHO African Region, home to over 61% of people dying from HIV-related causes in 2018. An estimated 470 000 [340 000‚àí630 000] people died in the African Region from HIV-related causes in 2018, which indicates that mortality has dropped by almost 40% since 2010.
