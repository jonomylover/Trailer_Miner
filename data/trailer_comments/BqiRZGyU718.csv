Now people get death?!  =0 At 1:13, the creepy old lady character they stereotypically throw into these kind of movies for exposition says ""Instead, a much darker, ancient spirit"" and then at 1:50 says ""He is the shadow of Saint Nicholas"" as if darkness and shadows are scary, evil, or unnatural.  But there's no need to be afraid of the dark or of our shadow, and they are not a negative or unnatural things.  It's kind of odd how some people feel about darkness.  When talking about certain things, some people equate the dark to being scary, bad, or evil, but I never could understand it.  =/ This is just a philosophical thought, but if darkness has been around ever since the beginning of everything before anything else, is all around us, and there is even inside of us (I imagine it gets pretty dark inside of our bodies.  I don't think we have light bulbs inside of us), and follows us around in the form of our shadow, isn't darkness one of the most natural and non-evil things out there?  =o And night time is actually one of the most peaceful times for most people.  It's when we rewind, recharge, and heal.  Can't people just say what they mean? Could have easily said ""evil"" there, you know. l=/ And I've heard some things about this Krampus.  I've heard he punishes the bad.  So does that, in a way, make him good?

Not that Toni Collette, Adam Scott, and David Koechner are exactly A-list celebrities, but they are known to star in bigger movies, typically comedies.  This film is listed as a black-comedy though so maybe there will be some good laughs..... which actually kind of upsets me because I think the Krampus character needs to be a full blown horror flick.

2016-09-20T21:41:23,"This wasn't bad at all. Not scary, but worth watching for bad-ass Aunt Dorothy.   They tried to show real snow, which can be up to your thighs,  and believe me, running is out of the question. Walking is a trick. But at least it's not the lame and unreal Hollywood snow, which is minor at best, and not even cold, much less dangerous. I that kind of snow/cold, you're not going anywhere without clothes and a hat on. Once it's below 0, you'll notice the lack of clothes right away and it hurts to breathe.   The breath-seeing is bad CGI, though. See ""Titanic"" for the same effect, but done realistically.   I liked it, and out of 10 movies or more I get from the library, maybe one makes it past 5 minutes. TV shows, dramas, sitcoms, and rom-coms and particularly horror movies don't age well.   Could've sworn this was a horror movie in the 80's...  Btw, how does a young kid in the 'burbs know how to drive anything?? If so, you'd think he'd know about flooding carbs, right, assuming he somehow learned in the country where they still have lots of old vehicles...(if you smell gas, you have to flood it all the way out by putting the gas pedal on the floor)   PS, if you have snow to your thighs, it's extremely unlikely you are hearing any sirens, because no one's going anywhere...I've seen snow like that in a major city.
