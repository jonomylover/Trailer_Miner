2017-03-17T23:06:14,"So to all the people who keep saying this movie is a ripoff of Drive‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not. Edgar Wright himself says he originally thought of the idea almost 22 years ago and even adapted the idea into a 2003 music video for Mint Royale (which is the opening scene of the movie). So let‚Äôs stop all this nonsense about it being a parody or ripoff because that‚Äôs been settled by the man Edgar Wright himself.  Secondly, to all the people who don‚Äôt think Ansel Elgort was a good cast for Baby, Elgort was the first to join soon after Wright announced production on Baby Driver. The rest of the star studded cast joined soon after. Now I‚Äôm the last person to say I‚Äôm an Ansel Elgort fan, but if legend Edgar Wright had the confidence to cast Elgort before anyone else as his lead for Wright‚Äôs first solo writing and directing credit after 22 years, I think that should answer the skepticism people might have about Elgort as Baby. Not to mention all the rave reviews coming from SXSW that talk about how Elgort is the one that steals the show from veteran buffs Spacey, Hamm, and Foxx, which is a pretty hard feat to do give or take a few Academy Awards, Emmys, Golden Globes, etc.  Never stop doing your thing Edgar Wright.
