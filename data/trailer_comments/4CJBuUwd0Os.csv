2015-08-03T02:32:16,"Okay something has been bugging me with movies recently. Most movies which involve the government and the army are always portrayed in middle eastern countries. Usually they are portrayed as the place of having really cruel organizations. To be fair is this false, no but is it helping no. Right now the media is making a lot of money off ""the problems of the middle east"" and people are eating it up. They never give the alternative view of all the civilians who live in this places view since that's not what people want. Showing the middle east in a different light would damage their views thus their cash flow. How many people here heard of the Taliban killing in Pakistan of hundreds of school children? One soldier dies world cries, Muslim ""holocaust"" currently happening in Burma, who cares? This is also beneficial of the government (conspiracy theory lol) since it gives them more power. Take what happened in Canada. Bill C-51 gives Canada the same power that America has (to spy on people) so they justify it by saying it's for your protection against things like that. You think people would have a vote on that since we live in a democracy but nope we don't. The same thing applies to hollywood (the media stuff) if they portray the Americans in a bad light their cash flow will be hurt. This is causing people to make bias views ( due to what is happening with ISIS and all that) but islam is not to blame for the islamic nation, its the natural order of ""the fall and rise of civilizations"". Islam had its golden age from the 6 century to around the 12 century before the Mongols ( Genghis Khan) . If at any point in history did Islam not be a good cause for the world I would believe that Islam is bad religion somewhat but history has shown the opposite. ibn al-Haytham is considered to be the first ever scientist and guess what he was a Muslim. He led to the discoveries about geometry and invented the scientific method. He made major astronomy jumps for his time. 2/3rds of all star names are in arabic, ever wondered why?? One of the most Chivalrous knights during this was saladin. He after taking back Jerusalem back from the crusaders (who butchered the jews and Muslims since people of any religion were allowed to practice their religion in Muslim conquered areas) let them all go, he even got his knight to escort them safely. He was adored by his enemies alike (richard the lionheart) Baghdad used to be place where scholars from all around the world gathered to talk, no matter you faith. Why doesn't the media talk about that or talk about the history of these Islamic nations instead of just reporting deaths oh yea because that would blame America. Not to say I hate America or American citizens at all they have given a lot of my relatives visas to leave the middle east and pursue great careers in America.",0,0,Guffpup,4CJBuUwd0Os,0.09650974025974025,2015-08-03 02:32:16,True,True

If done right of course, and yeah, Michael Bay does have a spotty record at that. But I think even he knows the difference between the typical mindless action blockbuster for kids(his biggest audience the past 10 years)and something completely different & relevant of the gravity of Benghazi.

2015-11-05T23:23:03,"So,Hollywood's already doing a Benghazi movie despite the fact that it's only been three years since the attack happend? and beyond that we have Michael Bay directing (who's not equipped to handle a movie with sensitive political subtext) and have it set to be released during an election year when Hilary Clinton (the secretary of state during the incident) has a fairly good chance of being the Democratic Presidential candidate when the movie comes out. Why is a sub-par action movie director making a politically themed action movie during an election year? it's seems like its something outside of his grasp. The last two times Bay tried to be dramatic or to make a movie with some substance we got Pain and Gain and Pearl Harbor, both of which were pretty bad movies.  Michael Bay is not a good director, even for his own genre. I know that he's tried to direct more dramatic films in the past, but he doesn't have the depth or the insight to helm such a project and from the look of the film it seems more like a propagandist cash grab For the 2016 election than it does a film that going to stand the test of time or be remembered fondly.   If Hollywood was going to do a Benghazi movie regardless of what year it was coming out, they needed a better director to handle such sensitive subject matter.  It kind of feels like It'll be Bay's Lone Survivor, where he'll show his own admiration for the armed forced, but also end up playing fast and loose with the facts and making more of a pro-American film than an accurate or complex analysis of the Benghazi attack.",0,3,Godzilla52,4CJBuUwd0Os,0.0887419871794872,2015-11-05 23:23:03,True,True

An October 2012 report confirms:  Weapons from the former Libya military stockpiles were shipped from the port of Benghazi, Libya to the Port of Banias and the Port of Borj Islam, Syria. The weapons shipped during late-August 2012 were Sniper rifles, RPG’s, and 125 mm and 155mm howitzers missiles.  During the immediate aftermath of, and following the uncertainty caused by, the downfall of the ((Qaddafi)) regime in October 2011 and up until early September of 2012, weapons from the former Libya military stockpiles located in Benghazi, Libya were shipped from the port of Benghazi, Libya to the ports of Banias and the Port of Borj Islam, Syria. The Syrian ports were chosen due to the small amount of cargo traffic transiting these two ports. The ships used to transport the weapons were medium-sized and able to hold 10 or less shipping containers of cargo.  The DIA document further details:  The weapons shipped from Syria during late-August 2012 were Sniper rifles, RPG’s and 125mm and 155mm howitzers missiles. The numbers for each weapon were estimated to be: 500 Sniper rifles, 100 RPG launchers with 300 total rounds, and approximately 400 howitzers missiles [200 ea – 125mm and 200ea – 155 mm.]",0,0,Exploding Pigs,4CJBuUwd0Os,-0.041666666666666664,2016-01-19 20:49:02,False,True

When an 80mm mortar goes off 5 ft from you, you don't get up and walk it off (you're probably dead), .50 bullets go through those thin walls (and roof of compound they were in) as if it were made of paper. 7.62mm rounds only work in a 240B even though the SAW gunners were strapped with 7.62(5.56 links are way smaller). It's hard as hell to hit anything outside of 25m with night vision and not use your PEQ-15 (they only used the PEQ-15 once to spot some targets). RPG rounds don't explode like 5 lbs of C4.
