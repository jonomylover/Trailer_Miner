Just think about really let your mind open up to the possibility that Barney the dinosaur is going come an rip you open if you don't sing the I love you song lol No seriously If I was a mad scientist I would have a back up plan for if I made a monster dinosaur. I always wanted one lol But seriously .. SHRINK RAY!!!

If an elephant were wandering near the seashore and one of these sea scorpions were alive today that is.  I found an article: ....On 20.11.2007 scientists who discovered the fossil claw of a giant sea scorpion in southern Germany say the find -- the biggest of its kind -- suggests similar ancient creatures were much larger than previously thought. German palaeontologist Markus Poschmann excavated the fossilized claw of the giant aquatic creature from 390 million-year-old rocks near the town of Pr√ºm in Rhineland Palatinate, the online journal Biology Letters reported on Tuesday, Nov. 20. The 46-centimeter (18-inch) claw probably came from an animal around 2.5 meters (eight feet, two inches) in length -- half a meter longer than any previously found. ""This is an amazing discovery,"" said Simon Braddy from the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol in England, in a press release. Braddy, along with Poschmann from the General Department of Cultural Heritage in Rhineland-Palatinate and Erik Tetlie from Yale University, co-authored the report.
