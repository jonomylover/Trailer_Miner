2015-11-13T11:05:50,"I'm not one to get too caught up in christian or feel good movies. However this trailer had me near tears when the doctors kept telling the mom there was nothing wrong or it wasn't a serious condition. As someone who has spent all of my teenage career having to fight with doctors who insist nothing is wrong with me, it struck a chord. You can't begin to imagine the frustration of being in pain on a hospital bed while a resident 'doctor' explains to your parents that you are making it up to avoid school. While I can't think of any scientific explanation for what happened to the little girl that healed her, this is one of those times where I'm willing to just accept the unexplainable and fall back on my faith. Because going through what she was going through is hell, and I'm glad that it's over for her.

However I encourage you to read it and get a bit more sophisticated rather than jumping on the god train and claiming god is real and this story serves as proof!   Hollywood is not stupid. This movie is purposely targeting low income families across the U.S who believe in religion without second questioning it. It knows that there is a lot of controversy and lot of people including myself trying to say that it is ignorant to state that god is exist and that there is only one true religion etc. Hollywood knows religious people, who have been social conditioned their whole life, will watch this movie in order to feel better about their faith and use it to support their claim that god is real. The sad part is that it will probably work...   People can be so easily influenced over a exaggerated title: Miracles from Heaven.
