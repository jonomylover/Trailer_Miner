2018-03-14T15:46:14,"This movie is based on a biographical book called ""Red Sky in Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss, and Survival at Sea"" by  Tami Oldham Ashcraft. I read this book a few years ago and from that trailer I can see that they did some major changes on the movie adaptation. Most important one: Richard Sharp (Sam Claflin's character) died in real life while the storm was happening and Tami Oldham was the only one of them who survived after 42 days at sea alone. I think they did it on purpose because it would have probably been boring to only see her alone on that boat for the whole movie (maybe he dies later in the movie, I can't be sure), but it's still wrong as it is based on a true story.",143,32,DafniGabriella,n9ukI7khQpE,0.07279411764705881,2018-03-14 15:46:14,True,True

As the two avid sailors set out on a journey across the ocean, Tami Oldham (Woodley) and Richard Sharp (Claflin) couldn't anticipate they would be sailing directly into one of the most catastrophic hurricanes in recorded history. In the aftermath of the storm, Tami awakens to find Richard badly injured and their boat in ruins. With no hope for rescue, Tami must find the strength and determination to save herself and the only man she has ever loved. Adrift is the unforgettable story about the resilience of the human spirit and the transcendent power of love  Director: Baltasar Korm√°kur  Writers: Tami Ashcraft (book) (as Tami Oldham Ashcraft), Aaron Kandell   Stars: Shailene Woodley, Sam Claflin, Grace Palmer",0,0,Nindya Galas,n9ukI7khQpE,0.2421875,2018-06-09 16:04:19,False,True
