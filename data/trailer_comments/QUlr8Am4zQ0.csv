But it's gonna take an attention span longer than a tweet. The book reminded me of, first, 1984, and second, ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" (Nathanial West). Hanks' character--in the book--isn't a villain, but a misguided optimist. In response to some of the other comments: Never watch trailers if you want a movie to have any suspense at all. Or if you intend to read the book it's based on.
