On the other hand, there's going to be giant ammount of right-wing politicians that will simply not be able to ignore this piece of romantic teen drama made probably for not-entirely-stable retards and will go on with all the ""cucks"" and ""invasion"" stuff.

Start doing something about it instead of antagonize & talking. This movie doesn‚Äôt help the cause it only s brain washes today generation and tomorrows.  Being a cop isn‚Äôt easy. Making 30,000 to 50,000 a year, 15 hours shifts with a wife & kids at home to balance is hard. One bad cop doesn‚Äôt speak for the rest. There cops that just want to do it for the passion & helping there communities & support their families go home in peace. The trailer is a terrible example more like images what cops use to do more likely 25 to 30 years ago. Plus everyone now a days know to always comply what an officer says especially when you have nothing to hide or done. It‚Äôs easy not hard. In that trailer situation cops tell you to keep your hands on the hood because police officers are trained for different spilt situations an outcomes if necessary to save their own lives. No one ever reaches into there cars, pockets or moves their own hands away from the stirring wheel when pulled over. But hey I know it‚Äôs a movie.. I just wanted to give an opinion. No cop ever wakes up in the morning wanting to shoot somebody. it‚Äôs the situation.

They could produces other movies about other things but it won't happen. It will always be about being wronged. Well here's some news we all are wronged. But for some reason a movie like this is made and only a certain percentage of people will see. I will not because no one is more special then the next person. So much money is flushed down the toilet to make movies like this mainly because this is what most of what society expects and thinks they must live up too. That bad is good and good is better.

I'm confused as to why people are complaining about Amandla as Starr, in the book, Starr is described as 'caramel-skinned' (but she hates being called that) and her mum is 'high yella' while her dad is dark-skinned. Also, did I mention that the mother's brother's name is Carlos? Sure, a non-hispanic person may have a Hispanic name, but that and the 'high yella' painted to me a picture of some sort of admixture, so Amandla does fit the profile, by skin colour and by admixture. The dark-skinned girl on the cover is what threw people off, and I thought Starr was dark-skinned too from the cover but she's really not. Apparently, the cover has nothing to do with Starr's physicality but with #BLM. Yes, colorism is absolutely a thing and we have to work towards fixing that but in this case, it appears that the casting of Starr was done by the book.

2018-06-26T05:00:46,"This is gonna be the first time I've read a book way before there was mention of a film, and now I understand the partial frustrations that may arise when your favorite book is being adapted into a film üôÉ  In the book, Khalil doesn't pick up his hairbrush while instructed to stand beside the car. He only peeps in through the window to ask if Starr is okay. By making him take out a *hairbrush* , despite being pulled over and instructed to stand beside the car, the movie makes him look more careless/disobedient than he was--making it easier to defend the cop in this situation.  But to clarify/discuss a little about what happened in the book, while Khalil did initially respond with annoyance toward the cop, we *know* he didn't do anything wrong to begin with. Granted Khalil could have sounded more respectful/polite as he asked why he was pulled over, but he is human. And when one's pulled over for presumably no reason, besides perhaps racial profiling, we can see why one would be a bit annoyed. The cop's human too, so of course this rubs him the wrong way. But, going off how the event played out in the book, to make the assumption Khalil was reaching for a gun because he ducked his head in a window while the cop was at his car? Khalil should have known better than to move (even if his intention was just to check on his friend), but come on. That was the reason to shoot? *Several* times? The cop's retelling of the events with false information even suggests that the cop realizes how bad the telling of the true events would make him look. So in this specific instance, one should most certainly side with the victims.   Anyways, back to the original point of this comment, the use of the hairbrush in that movie scene is bothersome for me as one who read the book, but I have to remind myself that this is an adaptation of the book--not a carbon copy. I'm still excited to see how well they did depicting the story along with its overall message! ü§ôüèæ",0,0,Nikki U.,3MM8OkVT0hw,0.06833791208791208,2018-06-26 05:00:46,True,True

Then the story moved to a black cop who didn't shoot a suspicious white man and was shot by him, then a Hispanic cop walking down the street and getting blown away. Every race fights eachother and these films fuel those fights. I've never been racist towards any race, it's unfair to assume, but I've been assumed to have privileges, but the truth is just last week I got pulled over and he told me to put my hands on the dash, why?

Now Starr‚Äôs experiences were based off Angie Thomas‚Äô(the author) and how she had to live a double life basically. I get that. But I feel as if the movie kinda overgeneralizes about how students at private and public schools function. I‚Äôve known girls who have gotten addicted to meth and one who got a pregnant yet their parents payed 13 grand a year for their education. I know the tuition price because I was gonna attend there as well but stuff fell short. All the while I‚Äôve known dedicated kids who attend public schools,dedicate their life to their education etc etc. But because they go to a C minus Niche rated school they‚Äôre not taken seriously.Where does this narrative leave those dedicated students who DO go to schools in lower income neighborhoods. I hope I‚Äôm wrong. I really do. This is just a trailer so I still have high hopes. Just that wording about the school gave me a weird feeling. But I‚Äôm probably just reading in too deep into it and it‚Äôs gonna be a great movie. In elementary I  went to private but hung around neighborhoods on the lower economic scale. Where food and necessities are just more affordable. Most of my classmates had dads who golfed on the weekend while My dad had to work.

I don't care if you're black, hispanic, white, asian or whatever. If a cop directs you to keep your hands on the car, you do it. It's for the cop's safety. The reason is because some people (not him) go to reach for weapons. The cop doesn't have time to think it over because IF that is a weapon he may be too late. Having said that, I'm glad that people in the comments have stated that in the book he didn't reach. That is a much better conclusion and conveys the point they're trying to make.

Not to mention the actors I've named (and are all I ever see in movies anymore) are biracial & light skinned. Me personally I've never seen a dark skinned girl play any teenage girl roles for any movies so far. If you have, please tell me because I'd definitely love to. We need more diversity in general tbfh. It's okay to have biracial girls and light skinned girls but we need more color thrown in these teen movies because those aren't the only colors we black people are js lol. but you cannot tell me colorism is not a problem, because it definitely is...lmao. I'm just saying, please have more diversity within our own community rather than just light skinned black women. Thanks.",1,1,lelys,3MM8OkVT0hw,0.263235294117647,2018-06-28 05:20:45,True,True

In fairness I've never read the book, but apparently no one is sure what Star looks like. On the cover it's a dark-skinned girl, but some say she was light others say dark. Black is black no matter what shade you are. I'm sure this pointless topic all started when black family comedies replaced a dark-skinned actress with a light-skinned one. I found that annoying myself as well, but this movie shouldn't be judged on whether the girls skin is too light. Being black isn't about the shade of your skin or where you live or how you talk.

This movie makes us look like bastards and murderers. It is wrong. It is especially wrong to sensationalize racism, to say it is more than it is, and to say that all police officers are wrong and horrible. There is a United States Supreme Court case, Tennessee versus Gardner, that specifically authorized is officers to utilize lethal Force when it is objectively reasonable. Want to subject is given clear and distinct verbal commands to remain where he is. Once stepped out of the vehicle, and then he goes back to the vehicle, and is told to stop, we believe it is to retrieve a weapon to kill us. That is a reasonable assumption, because many officers have died for exactly that reason. The subject then pulls out an object with his hand. He is again told to stop and refuses. The officer fires. That is the way it is. The subject would be alive if he had obeyed officers commands. This movie is unbelievable and that it ignores all of this.

I have no idea why the movie changed it because people who haven‚Äôt read the book will now interpret it wrong and may say the shooting was justified but that isn‚Äôt what actually happened.  If you read the book you can clearly see that the police officer was being excessive and more aggressive than was necessary. The cop was not doing his job right. The reason everyone was protesting and rioting was because this was a 16 year old black kid living in a neighborhood that was known for drugs, violence, etc, and that was ultimately the reason he was shot, due to racial profiling the cop just assumed they were bad kids and they were up to no good. And let‚Äôs be honest if this were a white person or a person with light skin this would not have been the result, there are steps that need to be taken and there‚Äôs proper protocol for everything. Because he was a black man he was automatically suspected.   And to the people who may say that the cop was scared for his life, that‚Äôs not a reason to take the life of a kid, of a living breathing person, because of an error in judgment. Cops are properly trained for those types of situations, and what the cop did in this story was clearly wrong and misguided.

Where was all the uproar when Ms Sternberg played what was suppose to be a clearly LATINA character in the film ""Colombiana""? Hollywood evidently couldn't find a good enough young Latina actress? Ms Sternberg was cast b/c she's hot right now for adaptations. The business takes advantage of momentum, which is why singer's albums are always dropping just after they're featured in a big song; and some new artists seem to be in various new films at the same time (ie: Daniel Kaluyya, etc). Why don't we all stop adding to the racism talk, and just try to grasp the message that the producers are trying to send in the film.

2018-08-08T14:31:52,"My biggest problem with this movie is the fact that Amandla Stenberg had been cast as Starr. It doesn't matter what Angie said, the way she chose to portray Starr on cover of her book is what was expected and that was a dark-skinned black girl. Not only is Amandla light skinned, she's mixed race. The book says that Starr is a cross between her parents and in this movie she's lighter that BOTH OF THEM. After all of Amandla talk about being pro black and quote unquote ""dropping out"" of Black Panther to let darker skinned girls ""have a chance"", this is something else she also should have deemed important for a darker girl to have. I'm not only upset with her for snatching the role, but also with the casting directors for putting her in it. For some reason, Hollyweird seems to have the misconception that movies featuring dark skinned people won't sell as much but Black Panther was full dark skins and culture and completely smashed the box office. Coincidence? I think not.  I have a problem with accepting biracial people as black because when we do, they become the face of our community and that becomes a problem. They are then deemed the ""acceptable"" black people and the rest of us are then misrepresented. Don't even tell me that Amandla is black enough because she isn't, she's really not. This just throws Starr's entire story out the window because it's supposed the represent the darker skinned community and the prejudice against us but at the end of the day, I guess Amandla cares more about  making money than the message. Not to mention that her acting isn't that great yet everyone continues to hype her up.",7,3,black heaux,3MM8OkVT0hw,0.04333333333333334,2018-08-08 14:31:52,True,True

I'm in support of the movement and the book was also phenomenal but with even ""little"" details changed it changed the whole story.  The problem with Khalil (the friend hero was killed) being killed was that he didn't reach into the car, he got unlawfully pulled over, was pulled out of his car for asking why he was pulled over, and was shot not once or twice but three times while he was unarmed and had nothing remotely dangerous or unlawful in his car.  Then the cop proceeded to get off the hook with no charges and not even suspension. The book doesn't portray all cops as being bad in fact the opposite it shows that most cops are good but there are a selected few that are racist and/or abuse their power.  They changed Khalil into reaching into his car for a dark colored brush when he was told to stay still which is reason to shoot in a cops mind. The whole anger and rioting is that Khalil was unarmed and listened and followed instructions of the cop and was still shot 3x. It shoes the systematic oppression of black people and how all evidence can point to unlawful and unjust and they still get off the hook cuz theyre white.",1,0,Jillian Louise,3MM8OkVT0hw,-0.06504629629629628,2018-08-13 08:33:19,True,True

In this situation the author made one of the police officer committing police brutality not the other way around,keep in mind this is a story so Angie the author made it from one point of view and a story that was on *Police Brutality* throughout the book the police officer is very nasty and just disrespectful - trying not to give spoilers but there was something huge that wasn't in the trailer that happens in the book,not sure if it's involved in the movie but reading the book it makes a whole lot more sense as to why the police officer wasn't a 'good guy'.

The biggest threat facing a black person isn't the cops, it's being shot by another black person but instead acknowledging the truth you prefer to kneel to the Democratic party and play the victim of the evil white man.

I get where the film based on the trailer is coming from. But I hope it can do the book justice, I haven't read it but I might read it and try my best to come at this with as neutral of a mind as I can as I understand that my bias is that I have seen people get attacked by cops cause they acted like they were above the law. People attacked by corrupted cops. And those who never had an issue with a cop in their life.

I‚Äôve always had a hard time understanding why white people get the blame. The big issue here is the media. Media is pushing out these stories that you see on the news primarily black shootings, which makes the whole population believe that black shootings are at an all time high and all of them are unjustified. I believe in facts and evidence. Most of the people on the news that have been shot and killed by police have a simple headline such as ‚Äúman killed for selling CD‚Äôs‚Äù. Obviously that wasn‚Äôt the case, the man wasn‚Äôt shot just for selling CD‚Äôs. And most of the other ‚Äúunjustified shootings‚Äù that you see on the news are just fabricated. Is it very unfortunate that people are dying when probably it could‚Äôve been preventable? Yeah it‚Äôs pretty sad. But you also have to think, are you safe right now because they are out there doing they‚Äôre job? Yes (if not maybe move to a different location). Just please try to put yourself into a cops shoes and if you see someone reaching for something, what would you do? I‚Äôm not on here to argue or anything I‚Äôm just making a statement of which I believe. You can say what you want but please try to keep it civilized. Also if you want to check out a video by Steven Crowder , it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúBLACK LIVES MATTER DEBUNKED‚Äù it really just puts a lot of things into perspective and separates the truth from the lies.

2018-09-24T11:34:53,"Will be interesting to see what *yet another film* on the Black/white, black/cop, and poor/rich divides in our society does. Being that our society is already severed on multiple faults, I'm not expecting much.  From a narrative standpoint, the movie seems to take offence that the shooting of this kid would be in any way justified; However, while it is a tragic event, it wasn't random violence, and its not just the boys friends, family, and neighborhood that are affected. The cop will have to live with the fact he shot an unarmed man, and the black community will never let him move past it. The entire police-force of that city and, with the advent of social media, most of the nation, will have to deal with the fallout of an outraged congregation.  Multiple episodes in the Cop drama, Blue Bloods,  deal with this facet- Its set in a modern day progressive New-York, and deals with the White, Irish-Catholic family that is the Reagan clan. It does a very good job of showing that even those ""in power"" are not always the most powerful people in a situation- I'd highly recommend watching it as well as this movie, so that you get to see the issue from both sides- One look from the point of view of a smart, black teenager from the ghetto, and that of her family, the other from a family of honorable cops (most notably Danny and Jamie, one a seasoned, hard-ball detective who steps on the line, the other a lawyer turned cop, your classic boy-scout who follows the rules as far as they're written).   It'll also be interesting to see how many people care that the shooting of this 17 year-old kid, while tragic, is more understandable if viewed from another perspective beyond the one shown in the trailer and, as I can reasonably assume, the movie.  While I will agree that the use of force is something to be avoided *if possible*, the definition of just how possible it is has to stop at some point. A cops first job is to take criminals, whoever they may be, off the street, and the second job entailed in that is to keep ordinary, law abiding people safe. In this particular case, the officer doesn't know what the man he just pulled over has, and it could be something deadly to him or to any nearby citizens- for sake of example, a gun.   All that taken into consideration, you are now in the following scenario: A man you just pulled over is reaching inside his car, to grab some object. It is dark, and you don't know the man, so would have no idea as to whether he is violent or not but for the at most couple of minutes you've known him since pulling him over. As he pulls his hand back, you can see an object in his hand- You don't know what the object is- Maybe its a gun, maybe its a hair-brush. Pair that with the fact the individual in question has not only disobeyed your commands, but is currently in a decently high-stress situation- Being pulled over (for whatever reason). Hes roughly 20 feet from you- A fair distance to have to close with a knife, but possible given the circumstances, and more than within easy range of a handgun- You aren't a far off observer, you are right there, in the thick of it.

No amount of protesting, marching, or shooting police officers on their lunch break will change any of that. They shoot whites more frequently than blacks.

Well not all cops are racist, there are some that are, but not all. It's absolutely stupid when someone does not listen to the cop and grabs something. Black or not black the cop had the right to jump into defense mode. If he doesn't shoot then he's going to be the one shot. And no, I'm not white myself.

At 1:05 and 1:08 there were no stop signs, no traffic lights to run, and it didn't seem like they were speeding, so what were they pulled over for? 2nd: Couldn't he have just tased him?

I agree, the riots and molotovs and such are way overboard and unnecessary, if you're going to protest, do it peacefully like The Civil Rights movement, but in truth they should take the officer to court.

2018-10-07T09:30:09,"Honestly, it is probably more of a class issue than a race issue. However, grouping up by class especially in America is harder when grouping people by race is so easy especially when the usual identifiers of class; being the way in which you speak, how you carry yourself (posture and gate), and how you treat your possessions (rubbish in the car vs well maintained (not necessarily the value of the vehicle)), are often especially in the media used to identify the different racial cultures in the states.  Someone who exudes the appearance of class is usually attributed with adjectives like 'respectable', 'responsible', and 'rational'. Such a person has things they don't want to lose, values themselves and others and finally doesn't act on impulse. A policeman addressing an individual like this will be less wary that they will draw a pistol, try and escape or exhibit reckless behavior.  On the other hand, someone who lacks this appearance may have an untidy car, unkempt appearance, communicate in slang/pigeon or as though they missed more than a few days of school, have a peculiar/erratic gate/movement or poor posture will cumulatively add up to exude the appearance of low class. Which invokes the words 'unrespectable', 'unresponsible', and 'irrational'. It would be to these people that a question like ""Is that your kid in the car?"" is an actual question rather than par for the course, and of whom the policeman will be far more wary of drawing a pistol or weapon on him.  Unfortunately, it seems as though most media (even this film does it), actively portrays black communities as being not well off and also exhibiting some elements of 'low class' behavior. It seems as though unlike some other countries classful behavior has become racial signaling in most black communities where proper vernacular is deemed as being 'white' and something to avoid reinforcing the likelihood that people remain socially immobile and in these sectioned communities.  Even in the most ethnically homogenous societies, low-class people can still be picked up on based on the attributes outlined, sometimes with their very first utterance. The exception is that there is no racial sections of society which feel as though being low class is who they are, while there are people still in such countries content with being low class there is no admiration for such class and many openly strive to raise their class in the hopes that they will obtain social positions matching the class they emulate. Even in such homogenous societies, the perceived lower class are roughed up more by police with more injuries and overnight prison stays.  Most of what I refer to are generalizations that people/communities exhibit/perform and tensions caused. There very well may be exceptions, but the rules explain the data and human behavior.  tl:dr - Wealthy or upper-class black people in America are so in spite of rather than because of the low-class culture oft-identified with by the black communities (generalization). Law enforcement is more wary of low-class people who tend to be viewed by all as having less to lose financially and socially while also tending to be more irrational or violence-prone (generalization).",0,0,Soulwrite7,3MM8OkVT0hw,0.07056451612903226,2018-10-07 09:30:09,False,True

I know that in the book, he wasn't supposed to reach for the brush, but that's beside the point. That cop was straight up racist. 1. He had no right to pull that kid out of the car 2. The fact that he shot the kid before asking what was in his hands was a huge violation 3. The cop jumped to conclusions. Now all of you who keep defending the cop, no matter the race of you, are wrong. That man should be fired and arrested. We live in a world or racism, and everyone turns a blind eye.

I have not read the book yet, but watching this trailer made my heart sink because a life was lost period. Why because of his color, sadly because of his color.  White or Black, if it would have had the same outcome, who knows, but we do know here, it was because he was black.  All I know is it happens like this a lot in our world and it shouldn't.  What I have seen here was slow movements by him, and his body language said nothing of the sort of being defiant or defensive or to be feared,  he was leisurely hanging back talking to his girl. His movements were slow and he wasn't even turned to the officer when he pulled the hairbrush up by his head, granted  I want to see the whole movie, but that is what I seen in this trailer.  I heard no warning from the officer to stop, drop it, turn around with your hands in the air, NO WARNING - nothing of the sort just a shot, he acted out of fear, but really fear of what?  I would hope an pray the good officers of this world in certain situations, will use their voice first then act on what they see because they are trained correctly, not just an assumption without assessment and yes they have to think fast and on the defense.  Usually, as an officer I would also think, you would have a heightened sense of ""danger"" or ""fear"" from the citizens you pull over, here I see nothing but compliance and just a couple of teens out on a date, nothing to be feared of, not even the mood in the voices or their body language would you assume fear, so why would you assume he is a danger. Obviously, this officer has no sense or 6th sense of being for his job, to access the situation, he just acted without thinking, but really he couldn't have felt fear for his life from them.  And a taser would have sufficed, to deploy any other danger of moving in a defensive manner.  We have lost the main groundings of life, the compassion for other humans, love, respect.

It don't matter if the cops have an advantage since they already have their gun drawn and whatnot.. They can still be shot depending on the suspects reaction time. They are trained to keep caution and eliminate the threat before it goes to them. Thats why in some cop bodycams you see them empty like a whole mag inside the suspect cause there are people who can still shoot back even when they got shot multiple times due to adrenaline and drugs(if they used it). Watch PoliceActivity if you need to. And for those who might say use a taser... They also have videos of the  taser failing when the suspects has a weapon. The taser wont always put the enemy down.

2018-10-12T02:14:59,"So many triggered liberals (who we all know are stupid) and triggered anti-SJWs (who call themselves conservative but have absolutely no idea about what real conservatism is) in these comments. The media‚Äôs false coverage leads to the mutual mistrust between minorities and cops that allow these horrible things to happen. The cop expects resistance, the victim expects brutality, the victim doesnt realize the threat because he falsely believes the brutality is just a stereotype. He doesn‚Äôt listen, and is depiction of a threat will force the violence to happen.   There are some really fucked up cops out there.  And there are some really fucked up thugs out there who people say are the victims.  The Black Community has issues that nobody can deny, regardless of their political opinion. Liberals say that white people are the only reason it happens, and the U.S government is a regime that is imposing a reign of terror. Conservatives say the issues are black people‚Äôs fault because it is proven that more black people are killed by other black people, and the really ignorant ones somehow conclude that they don‚Äôt deserve help because of that. Both of those statements are stupid. I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and deny facts. Helping people by giving a positive representation of both sides is the perfect way to solve this. The cops and the ‚Äúvictims‚Äù will come closer to understanding one another, and unnecessary violence can be avoided. Tupac almost did it, but since then we have taken a few steps back. Nobody is able to do that though. The media really fucks everything.  I support Trump and 100% love conservatism. Conservatism believes in equality of opportunity, Liberalism believes in equality of outcome. Equality of opportunity puts power in people to better improve their own lives for themselves and their children. Equality of outcome puts power in the government to allow for them to intervene in people‚Äôs lives so that the people and their children benefit. These cop-hating liberals preach ‚Äúpower in the people‚Äù but if you truly believe in that then you believe in equality of opportunity.   Liberals are ignorant. But many Conservatives are too. Neither liberals nor ignorant conservatives are open-minded enough to see the better things for this.",7,2,Frank Migliore,3MM8OkVT0hw,-0.0030917280917280732,2018-10-12 02:14:59,False,True

It is still not an excuse to use your last resort weapon as your, ""shoot first ask questions later"". It's sad seeing our officers shoot people due to misunderstandings. I do agree with others about just following what the officers says. EVEN if you did not do anything wrong. If you get pulled over, just proceed to identify yourself, simple as that. Yes, you DO NOT have to, but you learn in the movie by not obeying a simple task, you put the officer into thinking that there may be something wrong. They need to be cautious because their lives are also in danger, therefore do not give an officer the wrong idea by not obeying.

2018-11-02T14:06:31,"I love how the movie isn't just one-sided... like ""oh cops are terrible they're racist"" but the movie also tells all sides of the story and what the people are feeling. People may think blacks sell drugs and stuff because they want to.. but it's not that. It's because they have to resort to that, after going through something hard.. like for example khalil lost his mom and had to take care of his younger brother, so he started selling drugs. But it also tells the police officer's side of the story. Like Starr's uncle said, he wouldn't shoot if it was a white man in a suit. He also tells Starr what it's like in the situation. Things go through their mind like ""oh, is the girl okay, did she just get raped, is he not following orders because he's hiding something, is he going to reach for a weapon?"" One thing I also learned though.. is that if a white man covered in tattoos, piercings, wearing pants that sag and a tanktop, and he was disobeying orders... There's a 50% chance the cop would shoot and not say ""put your hands up"" compared to if the guy was wearing a suit, well dressed, and had a nice car.

2018-11-09T19:09:34,"For anyone watching the trailer and thinking that reaching for the brush made no sense let me explain it with a very minor spoiler. He was casually talking to Starr telling her to calm down because he got pulled over for no reason and as he was casually talking he reached for the brush to brush his hair as he waited for the cop to come back to his car. (I dont remember for sure but I think he caught a glance of himself in the sideview mirror and wanted to adjust his hair because he is into his image). He wasn't thinking and did not realize how his actions could be interpreted. But he never pointed the brush at the cop or even lifted the brush up, as soon as he leaned out of the car the cop was already pointing the gun at him. It all happens very fast in the movie and comes out of nowhere. He should have not reached into the car and listend to Starr but the cop was also new and nervous and in the moment of confusion shot out of panic. The trailer slows down the scene to let it register with the audience that he gets shot over nothing. This movie doesn't blame cops, it blames reckless/panicked cops and corrupt cops. Both sides of the argument are explored in this movie. They explore the life of a black american trapped in the ghetto and just trying to get by, the actual criminals and druglords manipulating youngs to do their work so the young can have money to escape the ghetto, and the complicated job of a cop who has to assume the worst in a bad neighboorhood. And ofcourse the cops who are corrupt and immoral and racially profile and the shooter who is just unfit for the job and panics under that sort of circumstance.",0,0,Hanser C.B,3MM8OkVT0hw,-0.18232070707070708,2018-11-09 19:09:34,False,True

If you actually listened to what you are told to do you could avoid what could escalate into a dangerous situation. What has happened to respect for authority and all human beings in general? Why do people justify crime as the only necessary means to come up with income or respect? Why do people think they have territorial rights to geographical areas that they don‚Äôt own? Why don‚Äôt people apply discipline and seek to educate themselves to better their lives? Why is it so difficult to speak proper English? Why are children and adults carrying weapons intended to intimidate, rob and kill with? The only thing standing between us and a completely lawless world are the men and women who risk their own lives every day to serve and protect, those individuals have been killed in the line of duty by criminals day in and day out and with the firearms that blight this country being used against them in crimes so is it any wonder innocent people are killed when they don‚Äôt comply with straightforward commands? LISTEN and live. Playing the victim because of your race is inexcusable. Find a way to educate yourself, take responsibility for your actions and choices, distance yourself from criminals and crime. When a civilian is killed there are groups of people who use that situation to riot and loot. How is destroying property and stealing from innocent people who had nothing to do with the situation justified?

A teenager who could have a much brighter future, free of violence and injustice in the society. A teenager who could create a change to their community but people waisted their opportunity to do so because their mindset is imprinted by hate. I think the words ""THUGLIFE"" sets off a really powerful message that is so relevant to what we are dealing right now because we are so caught up with fighting off something thats completely irrelevant to fight for.   we emphasizes race to the society as if each of them should be mattered no matter what consequences should be taken, but how about us? The youth? The agent of change? Talking about not all white are good and not all black are bad? It doesnt make any sense. At the end of the day, what defines your wellbeing is what you do, not by a statement that you address. Doesn't matter what you look like  But whats concerning in issues like this is how the cycle keeps going and how it affects the younger generations to keep on following the social constructs thats imprinted on hate. Hate creates everything from violence to propaganda or supremacy. Because when we hate, we disagree on things. Seeing people who fight over about conversion propaganda, cop brutality, gun violence just wont solve the fact that if we keep hating on one side, theres always gonna be hostility and no justice.  People keep forgetting that theyre just kids, figuring out life and learning from it. But they had to be exposes in a world full of hate at a young age that it creates fear from both side which can never be compromised if we keep talking about culture and race. Yes you can be differentiated on the color of your skin or the culture you are from, but no matter what makes you, YOU, we can all agree that we are once a teenager trying to figure out life and fighting off of the fear of hate that creates injustice to our life.",2,0,Sev Vila,3MM8OkVT0hw,-0.13836996336996338,2019-03-05 16:30:44,False,False

The movie or book is not just propaganda, it is set to inform society that our stereotypes can be deadly. Implicit Bias exist for a reason. Prejudice does not always have to be intentional but it does not mean it is less offensive or impactful. When people see a young black man at night with a hood in the hood they automatically characterize him as a criminal. No one has the given right to take someone‚Äôs life. If a suspect IS armed it takes one shot to the LEG or LEGS to sedate not 3 or more in the chest to kill. There are so many stories of decades and decades of racial injustice that needs to be heard.

This movie really hit me hard because it made me think of the kids at my old high school v. My actual friends.   98% of my classmates were white.  Most of them rich, preppy, from well-to-do families, and simply SHELTERED and IGNORANT.  Almost none of them saw how lucky they were to live in such an affluent area with essentially nothing to truly worry about.  They never saw or were able to comprehend that not everyone has the same privileges and advantages as them; they believed all of the negative stereotypes that the media exaggerates so heavily.  Their ignorance, naivety, and close-mindedness astounded me. To be completely honest, I‚Äôm an 18 year old white girl; I know that that shouldn‚Äôt matter but unfortunately in this fucked-up world it does.  A lot of people are saying that this movie really hit home to them because they are black, Muslim, etc, and have gone through the same hardships.  I can‚Äôt say that I have had the same experiences as them, and I will never EVER say that I truly understand what it‚Äôs like because I don‚Äôt.

Religion exists because people in ancient time periods created superstitions, ideologies, and stories involving magic and supernatural characters. It's used to keep gullible people in line and compensate for having no scientific knowledge about anything. A deity called God is just one example of many supernatural characters that stem from religious beliefs. It's easy for example to make primitive people into god-fearing drones, have them believe that certain events or phenomenon are caused by entities/characters such as the devil, demons, ghosts, spirits, angels etc, and that everything was magically created by a god.

If he simply obeyed what the officer told him to do, he would have been off the hook, and the movie would've ended there. It was Khalils fault that he was shot. Not the officer.

I think everyone should watch it. Another great thing about this movie is the lead. I usually don't care about the main character of movies like this, but I really liked Starr. She never felt like an actor; she felt like a real person that I knew, and that's really good acting right there. And she has the best and most charming and most genuine smile in the world that just makes you want to smile too. The father's pretty good as well. He inspires his kids to do what they think is right and to never be quiet. That's just an awesome parent right there. And the mom's pretty realistic. I mean, she supports Starr for doing the right thing, but she also wants to protect her. The scene where she yells at Starr for going to a protest is so relatable and I think that's exactly what my own mother would say to me if I did what Starr did.
