This is a sequel to a ten year old movie that was quietly announced months ago and only acknowledged again a couple days before the first trailer and is set to be released in just around two and a half months... should I be worried? I don't necessarily doubt that this will be a good movie far from it and I also I'm sure that there was a lot of pre-production so I expect a solid script as well as good presentation because I doubt this takes that much budget like you could this with just over a million but still for this to sort of come out of nowhere being made in what feels like a year or less and is being released so soon after it's official promotional material has been released and not to mention again he made a full decade after its previous title and well after the zombie media craze of the late 00s early 10s has passed, the one that Zombieland was basically made as both a spoof and authentic part of.... it feels real late to make a sequel yes I've wanted to sequel sure the original stands on its own but there is wiggle room and potential for more stories with these characters and I have always wanted one if only one... but you can see my concern here not necessarily for the quality of the product but of its chances at the market of the day... just all these circumstances I've noticed surrounding it gives me reason to think that this was just a case of producers sitting on an IP for so long and sorta having an opportunity to use it although they're not really interested. That this is being made just to fill out a schedule... to release a movie on a date because we need to have a movie released at this point in the year.

Her thick hair was out and about, being controlled by only by a headband. He watched her annoyed expression as she pulled  a stray hair out of her face and tuck it behind her ear. He nearly smiled at the simple action leaving his dear friend Alex speechless. Mason never smiles.    Before Alex could question his future alphas actions he heard a low growl.

Oh yes, you're just a bunch of Disney white slaves/MCU fanboys on spent your life admiring the MCU like it's the Holy Grail or the King of the Hollywood industry.
