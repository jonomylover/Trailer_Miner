The main ""issue"" I'm seeing is that the animation isn't in the ""normal"" CGI style (especially the kids, who would normally have eyes literally bigger than their brains in any sort of modern animation style) which IMO could lend a hand to the  characters' ""abnormal creep"" factor, provided anyone OUTSIDE the family still looks relatively normal so as to give the designs contrast.  My main concern is that the jokes won't land, or won't be in the spirit of the original show, thus making the end product unfaithful if not outright bad.

The character animation especially feels a little stiff. It's not bad but it's not good either.  What's even weirder is the fact that apparently this is the same animation company that did Sausage Party. In that movie the animation was supposed to look bland because the movie was parodying animated films in general. Here, the studio is adapting a beloved series.

There's some of that in this but this is them just hanging out in their home. The Addam's family is always funny when they contrast to normal people.    The movie won't be them in their house the whole time I imagine. Someone normal will enter the house or the family leaves the house on multiple occasions.

Seriously, when I think of the Addams Family, I imagine the late, great Raul Julia as Gomez, the incomparable Angelica Huston as Morticia, the scenery-chewing Christopher Lloyd as Fester,  and the delightfully deadpan Christina Ricci as Wednesday (the rest of the cast don't get much focus, so anyone can play them, I guess). Anyone else, possibly barring the cast from the original B&W TV show, falls short.
