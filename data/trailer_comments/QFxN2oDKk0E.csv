2019-04-23T21:06:32,"Wow, this is LEAPS AND BOUNDS BETTER than the first one that came out a few years ago. I just hope the STORY (the writing) is just as good as the amazing visuals.  Having Bryan Cranston in the first Godzilla DIDN'T make it a good film, although every scene he was in he stole by far. I was so surprised they only kept him in the film for  20 mins or so. After that, the film fell off with the inferior writing and cast. The only other great actor in the first film , and he's back in this film as well is Ken Watanabe.  Also in this film is the great Zhang Ziyi, which I think many viewers either are not familiar  with her or don't realize or recognize that she is in the film (see 0:55) She was in Memoirs Of A Geisha and the CLASSIC FILM Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon along  with LEGENDARY martial artist/ actress Michelle Yeoh and  Chow Yun-Fat.  This looks incredible and they have revealed more fight scenes and monsters. I think Anguirus is in this as well  (@ 0:15)  To hear them say in the clip, 'How many of these things are there!?? (@ 0:15) and the answer be SEVENTEEN means that hopefully there will be some other classic monsters from the Godzilla films to show up in this. Although, having TOO MANY and not be able to expand or give more background on them would only be a waste. Especially if those monsters are killed off in this film.  Overall, I am hopeful and really amped for the release of this film in May. The only downer connected to this clip will be all the FAKE 'REACTIONS' from the multitude of SHEEPLE  looking to post their fake reactions to this when most of them are only posting reaction videos because others are and they want to be included in the Reaction Mashup clips but they have NO CLUE who most of these monsters are, their back story or the history of the Godzilla franchise, and as a man that has grown up with these films since way back in the 70's, I can spot a FUGAZI a mile away. -lol   'REACTION BOTS' BEWARE, I will be posting some shit on your clips if you are one of the fugazi's I am talking about.",2,0,Jovanni Ruiz,QFxN2oDKk0E,0.21498226950354615,2019-04-23 21:06:32,True,True

Will it beg you for mercy or implore you for pity? Will it agree to work for you, to be your slave for life? Can you make it a pet like a bird, or give it to your little girls to play with? Will merchants try to buy it to sell it in their shops? Will its hide be hurt by spears or its head by a harpoon? If you lay a hand on it, you will certainly remember the battle that follows. You won‚Äôt try that again! No, it is useless to try to capture it. The hunter who attempts it will be knocked down. And since no one dares to disturb it, who then can stand up to me? Who has given me anything that I need to pay back? Everything under heaven is mine. ‚ÄúI want to emphasize Leviathan‚Äôs limbs and its enormous strength and graceful form. Who can strip off its hide, and who can penetrate its double layer of armor? Who could pry open its jaws? For its teeth are terrible! The scales on its back are like rows of shields tightly sealed together. They are so close together that no air can get between them. Each scale sticks tight to the next. They interlock and cannot be penetrated. ‚ÄúWhen it sneezes, it flashes light! Its eyes are like the red of dawn. Lightning leaps from its mouth; flames of fire flash out. Smoke streams from its nostrils like steam from a pot heated over burning rushes. Its breath would kindle coals, for flames shoot from its mouth. ‚ÄúThe tremendous strength in Leviathan‚Äôs neck strikes terror wherever it goes. Its flesh is hard and firm and cannot be penetrated. Its heart is hard as rock, hard as a millstone. When it rises, the mighty are afraid, gripped by terror. No sword can stop it, no spear, dart, or javelin. Iron is nothing but straw to that creature, and bronze is like rotten wood. Arrows cannot make it flee. Stones shot from a sling are like bits of grass. Clubs are like a blade of grass, and it laughs at the swish of javelins. Its belly is covered with scales as sharp as glass. It plows up the ground as it drags through the mud. ‚ÄúLeviathan makes the water boil with its commotion. It stirs the depths like a pot of ointment. The water glistens in its wake, making the sea look white. Nothing on earth is its equal, no other creature so fearless. Of all the creatures, it is the proudest. It is the king of beasts.‚Äù‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Job‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠41:1-34‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ https://www.bible.com/116/job.41.1-34.nlt",0,0,John loyd King,QFxN2oDKk0E,-0.1191609977324263,2019-04-24 02:19:14,True,True

2019-04-24T07:13:41,"This is  probably unrealistic to ask, but can you please remove the unnecessary dialogue such as, ""My God.."" ""..zilla.""      Please get rid of the unnecessary dialogue in this film, or at least most of it.  By unnecessary I am referring to the lines that interrupt the intensity, the flow of suspense or action or important information, the immersion of the moment, just to show someone saying, ""That's messed up,"" or, ""It's Godzilla's world, we just live in it.""  I've put a lot of thought into this, so if you or anyone reads this, I appreciate it very much.  Not all will agree but here's some thoughts from a Godzilla fan, a movie fan and what I'd like to see as far as films being made heading toward the future with film making/storytelling (starting with my love of Godzilla and all the themes and concepts and possibilities he and his friends and enemies, including us, stand for).  Despite the heartfelt intro here, it's a simple request to consider that I think could strengthen instead of harm; the deep, spiritual, important and impactful tales that Godzilla films and concepts have stood for, promote and have made us think about since 1954.  Thanks!    Godzilla films and us true Godzilla fans have the unique chance to pave the way for thought providing, heavy concept and deeply emotional and inspiring stories with impactful messages, without the need for useless, gimmicky dialogue.  Let Godzilla and his true fans trample over the countless of other movies who rely on that same cheesy dialogue every other line, every single scene, and show them this is how you make a movie!  Let them realize they're just spec of failing dust.    Would be cool if Godzilla broke, no, shattered the mold and paves over the unfortunate trend of fleeting, forgettable hollywood movies.  Instead of writers injecting unnecessary and cringey dialogue into our beloved and potentially poignant films, our Godzilla and his films can set the standard for well crafted films containing deep emotion, heavy concepts, introducing new ways of thinking about our planet and our role and place on it and of course, unworthy to behold, ancestral battles - for us to survive on it.    Godzilla is too important, culturally, in real life and in the stories that he and his allies and enemies can weave to have this kind of dialogue anywhere near.  Godzilla franchise stands for too much to not be taken seriously.  He represents and demonstrates nature, ancient awesomeness, balance, protection, defense and the ability (our ability) to protect or harm our one and only true home - as well as our one and only true family - each other.  Us true fans don't need all these hollywood written jokes every other line of dialogue.  These films have a unique responsibility and chance to tell epic tales at least a bit more seriously than some of the the other slapstick ridden franchise with over the top nothingness.  Godzilla and it's heavy concepts, themes and lessons can actually contribute to the world, and to the world of cinema, through thought provoking and deeply emotional storytelling, through profound messages and inspiration.  The world of Godzilla offers genuine reflection about us and our role in the world and our place on our actual planet.  Get these awful attempts at humor out of our movie.  A few lines, max.  The rest needs to be focused, to be memorable and to go down in history.    Godzilla and his friends and enemies and us humans/animals who share the same planet and occupy the same space (on wildly differing scales), offer an exciting and unique world of giant creatures, good, bad and somewhere in between.  How we all survive among one another while we exist and operate at two dimensions of size/scale, the enormous and and tiny - and how we support or affect one another - while trying to survive and defend our planet and ultimately life = new and amazing concept for many to explore.  Imagine an age where these creatures suddenly did wake up and we did actually have to accept that they are a part of our planet and everyday existence - what an exciting thought and awesome concept!  The lore and ancient awesomeness of these guys and their relation to our planet and everything on it is wonderful and allows for deep and meaningful storytelling.   a bit more..",2,4,Daniel Burns,QFxN2oDKk0E,0.07465572026178087,2019-04-24 07:13:41,True,True

However, this shit looks pretty dope and I have a feeling I'm gonna like it for a few reasons. The U.S. no doubt has the most cash to throw into filmmaking, and this bloated piece will no doubt look just spectacular. Also, I'm dying to see my homie Rodan again in literally anything haha. Lastly, they have plans I believe to use this Gojira universe to cross over with the most recent King Kong film.  Yall have no idea how much money I would shell out to see a new 'Godzilla v.s.

(Matthew 7:22-23)<---Many will say to me in that day, (((Lord, Lord))), have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, (((ye that work iniquity/commit sin))). (Matthew 25:10-13)<---And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, (((Lord, Lord))), open to us. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, (((I know you not))). Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh).  Whosoever cometh to me,¬† and heareth my sayings,¬† and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:  He is like a man which built an house,¬† and digged deep,¬† and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose,¬† the stream beat vehemently upon that house,¬† and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.  But he that heareth,¬† and doeth not,  is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.  (Luke 6:46-49).  ***(Hears...and does): One who listens to and acts on Jesus teaching can face any difficult circumstance.  ***(Heard and did nothing): Not acting on Jesus teaching will cause a person to be overwhelmed by circumstances, eventually resulting in total loss.",0,0,mlzanercik,QFxN2oDKk0E,0.11458333333333333,2019-04-24 11:48:50,True,True

2019-04-26T00:59:26,so the first one had very few instances of monsters making us fear that this would be like godzilla where most of it was boring and they allude to godzilla half the movie and have about 12 total min of him on the screen in an hour plus movie. they also had very shoddy cgi in the early trailers and while fight choreography could still be much better it looks much more promising here and I would dare to say decent for a solo action film.  ¬†*HOWEVER*   that was not the biggest issue with the movie. there is still the huge issue of all the villians are not deserved. they have done godzilla and kong but not understanding what makes them good led to the directors destroying a series that had so much potential. they are making the first avengers movie with just iron man 2 and thor 2 as a base. the scary potential of the movie comes if they throw away good villians on a cash grab,0,0,gildarmesh,QFxN2oDKk0E,0.04772727272727273,2019-04-26 00:59:26,True,True

2019-05-17T13:49:52,"The previous trailers looked okay in terms of CG and the Clair de Lune soundtrack plus certain select shots helped breathe some life into the Godzilla movie franchise. However, the new scenes shown in this trailer have horrendous CG especially in the opening shot, which is drawn out and invites a lot of scrutiny compared to the rest of the trailer. The second scene of Mothra looks fine and we've seen it before as well as other 'epic shots', but it's only a few seconds. The third scene is where I feel offended even though I'm not a hardcore Godzilla fan (my apologies). It's certainly difficult to create a realistic 'mountain-like kaiju erupting out of a mountain' scene, but the particle effects in this look like it's from a decade ago from maybe a lower-budget movie. I was about to blame Youtube compression for the muddy image quality, but it's unfortunately not the case.  My main skepticism besides the CG (I have a lot of gripes besides the points above) is the story from all the past trailers combined. It looks like a generic 'American scientists plus military discover mankind-threatening monsters and some Japanese ppl conveniently inform them of their folklore/legends to make the kaiju larger than life' story. I didn't see this being a successful blockbuster then and I certainly don't see it now after watching this last trailer. Guesstimate: 55/100 or along the lines of Battle Angel: Alita and other similarly mediocre CG adaptations out nowadays.",0,2,Nominous,QFxN2oDKk0E,0.03386672850958565,2019-05-17 13:49:52,True,True

Cant they just watch it from the copper from save diatance? They have to wait for the monster came out then start running again. Then gozila come to fight nonster and their copper kicked by monster but not destroyed.

This movie was so kool in a lot of diff ways & will connect generational interpretations w/ new & die-hard lifelong fans as I am. From the mythos of the Titans & special appearances to the connections 2 some very real environmental issues revolving in our world regarding human carelessness w/ pollution, war & nuclear waste. All derivatives of the original concept of the Godzilla character & creation in 1954 as a metaphor to Hiroshima & Nagasaki 11 yrs before. There are of course great hat-tips thru-out the movie to industry greats such as original producer & creator of the original franchise Tomoyuki Tanaka & famed japanese actor & ""rubber-suit"" actor Haruo Nakajima who passed in '17. There's even a small tip to Ray Harryhausen, the godfather of American stop-motion monsters back then as well as a awesome soundtrack giving props to the original 1950's score. So much in this movie tht was expected by fans & I think it delivers on all fronts. There were some definite MEH spots here & there (brad whitfords character for example) & the really bad cover of B.O.C.'s Godzilla @ the end but this movie & the way it honors & brings new life into the Toho characters & storylines I've been in awe of all My life will have TRUE fans of the every Gojira franchise seeing this a couple times @ least.

Second, Godzilla: King of The Monsters was absolutely INSANE!!!!!!!!!! What a masterpiece Mike Dougherty has made!! This was a once in a lifetime movie experience that I will always remember for the rest of my life. I am SO glad I saw this in IMAX. I will never forget how massive the battle sequences were, and the monsters were just GODLIKE on the screen. Everything about this movie was pure perfection. This is why Legendary Entertainment is my favorite movie studio. Their movies almost NEVER disappoint. I could not believe what I was seeing on screen. My jaw was on the floor. This is without a doubt, one of the best if not THE best monster movie/creature feature ever made in cinema history. I will be getting this on Blu-ray when it comes out.

Maybe it's a nice throw back to the showa/Heisei cheesy human characters, but this one didn't score with me.   I liked the movie, mainly because I ALWAYS knew that the monsters and monster fights will be the absolute highlight of the Godzilla franchise and the humans to be either less than interesting or somewhat decent.

2019-06-03T05:29:46,"I don't know what the critics want out of this film after their reviews on Godzilla 2014.   Yes the human storyline was cheesy. The motivations were silly and some you just had to bear with. Having said that, I really LOVED and was AWED to experience the Titan fights from their human perspectives.  You'd feel as if you're on the plane, on the ground, scared for your own life and in submission to the behemoths as they destroyed the entire city without regard to our human sentiments and business.  The Titans were beyond EPIC. Their designs commanded fear and worship. The sounds they made--fron the weight of their bodies to their establishing roars-- would have you praying between your teeth.   This was a movie that listened to its fans and was created by people whom you couldn't deny to have genuine love for the character.  The fights were also some of the most beautiful visuals I have ever seen. The final battle between Gojira and Ghidorah delivered an epicness unparalleled. Rodan, upon his reveal, revelled (until of course when Ghidorah showed himself the bigger king of the skies). I could feel survival juice up the soldiers as he chased them through the clouds.  Let's talk about Mothra.   Mothra's design was revamped with aesthetics fit only for the queen of the heavens. Her fully spanning her wings for the first time was magical and evoked emotions and faith to her benevolence. That's why, Mothra's battle against Rodan made me and my boyfriend emotional. In fact, I got emotional every time Mothra got screentime. You just knew her destiny by the end of this.  Suffice it to say that this is a movie worth your money and time. What you're going to experience is not only a visual fiction, but also some of the passionate and most beautiful hard work of the film crew behind this.",2,0,Myra Villanueva,QFxN2oDKk0E,0.16235632183908041,2019-06-03 05:29:46,False,True

2019-06-03T05:41:41,"I have never written a review before, as honestly I find them to be useless, and this movie has driven that point home for me. I absolutely refuse to remain silent on a movie franchise that I've cared about since I was a child, with a modern film that does its predecessors justice by breathing new life into an ancient movie franchise, get torn to shreds by enigmatic critics that look for the most minute details to mark as ""cinematic sins"".  Rotten Tomatoes has given Godzilla: King of the Monsters a 39%, with Metacritic backing them up with equally dreadful reviews, while a quick google search shows that most movie goers (literally ~90% of the people who saw this movie) actually enjoyed this film. I sometimes use reviews to gauge if I might enjoy a movie, or if it's even worth going to watch it, but I went into this movie completely blind; avoiding trailers and reviews like the plague because I knew I was going to see this film regardless, and I might as well keep as much of it as a surprise for myself. The reviews on Rotten Tomatoes complain about the most outlandish details, many of them critiquing the CGI in the film that was actually gloriously executed. I saw all my favorite monsters brought to life in new, horrifying detail that satisfied the long-term monster movie fanboy in me. I now realize the critics just see movies and rate them as their entire career, so firstly, should I care about the opinion of a person that could only land a job as someone who slashes movies to ribbons? They're only payed to critique movies, so of course they're going to analyze every little detail to the point where it's just tiresome and counter-intuitive. Also, it's easy, and not at all uncommon, for say . . a movie production company to shell out a couple extra bucks to critics to give certain films bad reviews, or their own films good reviews just so they can make more money. After seeing The Last Jedi get a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes, I was convinced either they're getting payed off to act as ""influencers"", or they do not represent the everyday movie-goer's best interests. Either way, I have no respect for their ""critics"" and have long since replaced their judgment with my own. That site is clearly dominated by Disney/Marvel fanboys that see anything else as a threat to their darling angel known as MCU. Seriously, a RT review referred to Legendary's project as ""an MCUmonsterverse"". With that said, King of the Monsters was an absolutely illustrious movie that attacked the weaknesses of Godzilla 2014. Godzilla and his gang get more screen time in this film, and more importantly Michael Dougherty found the right balance of monster battle and human interactions that deliver a simple plot giving enough reason as to why we have giant monster fights. Yes, some of the characters were a bit underwhelming, but the movie at least gave the main characters enough of a chance to establish their disposition, so that you won't agree with every character's respective actions, but you at least understand why those characters made those choices. Another point to address is that the movie uses the trope of ""Humanity is killing the planet, and you should feel bad"". It doesn't bring anything new to the storytelling table, but it definitely doesn't deserve any demerits either. The fact remains that human-generated pollution IS harmful to the environment, that's just a fact. In this movie, it was just used as a brief plot development device, nothing more. The story immediately moves on and doesn't address it outside of one speech a character gives, leaving nothing to get hung up about. I also appreciate the director's decision to sprinkle tidbits of Godzilla callbacks that will satiate fans on narrative elements they hadn't even considered going into the theater. It ties up the movie's atmosphere and lets the fans of this series know that the director cares about this project. The cherry on top is a beautiful soundtrack that brings more emotion into critical scenes of the film, driving it all home as a sublime cinematic Godzilla experience.   It's seriously depressing how brutal critics are with their reviews for this movie. I'm actually watching this trailer for the first time as I write this. I'm so happy I avoided trailers, and I got to see this film not knowing where the plot was landing next. This movie was awesome and I think it's worthy to be recognized in the Godzilla movie franchise as nothing short of a success. I've cared about this series since I was a kid, probably going for 15 years now, and it is just amazing seeing this franchise I love bring my favorite monsters to a gorgeous new movie. The flip side of that is it just kills me seeing the terrible reviews online, when half the critics are just comparing this to Endgame and the MCU. I hope this movie recovers from the brutal reviews, and I hope they continue the Monsterverse.",2,0,kneedropperr,QFxN2oDKk0E,0.1379170922710249,2019-06-03 05:41:41,False,True

2019-06-05T13:41:25,"I had the answer on how to kill big monsters way back for Pacific Rim monsters (Kaiju).   You don't need a big mech costing Millions and tons of construction and pilots to drive them.   Here's the answer: You can use jet planes, really maneuverable and fast, with missiles that have the smallest nuclear warheads so we don't totally pollute the planet. The missiles just need to have really really hard/pokey tips. I mean REALLY POKEY and REALLY HARD so they can penetrate the monsters flesh/hide/scales/skin. Maybe made out of Carbon Steel or Tungsten Carbide. I'm sure there would be some scientists that could find something. Once it penetrates, it goes off. Sploosh and Done! Monster guts everywhere. It's hard to be a big ol' scary monster when you don't have any guts anymore, am I right?!?! Granted, you would need to pick your best attack time and approach and the jet would have to get in there, fire and get out. You would need some backup planes in case a monster swipes one or two out of the air. I'm thinking you have three at a time approach from 120 degrees apart so a least one would have an unseen approach by the monster.",1,0,JoeCubicle,QFxN2oDKk0E,0.06915266106442577,2019-06-05 13:41:25,False,True

I think they did an awesome job on all the titans, but especially mothra, its amazingly done how badass mothra is while at the same time to beautifull and peacefull. I think rodan has gotten the perfect design but could have used a little more screentime. King ghidorah is just perfect, like pure evil. I really like the look of him and his new abilaties. Godzilla, I dont have to say anything about him, its just perfect, the way he acts is awesome and I love the new spines and roar. The other titans where really cool too, I just hoped they actually did something. The family drama is well done too, I dont see how they put too little of it, first of all you are watching a movie about monsters, ofcourse it isnt gonna be fully about family drama, otherwise it will be like godzilla 2014, way too much family drama and too little monster fights, I think they nailed that part.

2019-07-17T12:53:10,"How This Trailer Really Fits the Monsterverse:  1.) The Music. The song Over the Rainbow expresses the beauty of this world, which is heavily emphasized in the trailers thus far. There is beauty in the most majestic figures, hence Mothra and Godzilla. Beauty can be found even in the destructive and terrifying aspects of reality, shown through Rodan and Ghidorah. The action in the last part of the trailer shows what we kaiju fans have been waiting for: fast-paced fighting with high levels of devastation.   2.) The Cinematography. Every shot of these kaiju represents what they are, something beyond mankind. Even if they are a superspecies/megafauna animal, their existence is to be in a higher realm of being. Especially with Ghidorah. He truly feels like he is a King, asserting himself over Godzilla with wings spread wide. For Godzilla, his power can be seen through his new and improved atomic breath and signature new roar. Even his sheer size can be felt in his shots with the sub and with Serizawa. This size of his makes Ghidorah even larger and scarier. Next is Rodan. His destruction in every shot from a bird's-eye and the normal view is breathtaking. His shots of being awakened are just stellar. Him slowly crawling out of that volcano with his slow movements makes for a very terrifying creature I hope to be impressed by in theaters. Last but not least, Mothra. The true beauty of this movie alongside Ghidorah in my opinion. Those shots of her spreading her wings, displaying the title of Queen of the Monsters...very good. I have no words to describe her shots in the trailers. The filmmakers did an AMAZING job with these kaiju overall.   3.) The Designs of the Kaiju: Every aspect of these kaiju just scream god. Everything from Ghidorah's size, Mothra's wings, and Godzilla himself. Just look at them in the trailers and they'll feel like mythological beasts that have entered our world and will be there forever.     NOT MINE  I'M JUST SHARING HE'S OPINION BECAUSE IT'S BREATHTAKING",81,1,Kelven Tacsagon,QFxN2oDKk0E,0.10589442815249267,2019-07-17 12:53:10,False,True

Will King Kong and Godzilla work together to fight a bigger  enemy. From what I'm seeing on the all the recent films, I have broken down one important detail and that's going to be that Godzilla and King Kong will be fighting each other. And some fans want potential, in this future film so why not have a bigger badder enemy? Why repeat the same film, where it's one-sided. And all you have is an update film effects, technology, visuals, but the same story? The original Godzilla vs King Kong movie had both sides US and Japan having Godzilla lose the fight.

2019-07-22T22:03:42,Was so excited for this only for it to be so disappointing. Everyone complained the first didnt have enough monsters but for me because of that it really gave the monster scenes tremendous weight and mystery. I LOVED it. I got the chills the first godzilla sighting.  Each monster scene was holy fuck moments. This new movie that shock and awe is completely gone. The cuts are wayyyy to fast you never get a chance to really focus on the monsters before it cuts. And by god the script. It feels like it was just thrown together super quick and finished as the movie was shot. The story in my opinion feels like the writers just went with the first idea they had and ran with it without properly thinking and fleshing it out only to realize when it was to late. The motivations for veras character were just stupid and im actually shocked millie took this role after reading that script. Listen I know its a monster movie and they arent meant to be serious oscar contenders but im just so bummed. They should of stuck with gareth edwards at least he had a vision and there would of been some continuity as far as the monster sections go and he definitely was good at making the monster parts feel super epic and scary.  I basically feel exactly like I did after the pacific rim sequel.

The combination of use of CGI, the audio (the monster screams omg), the music and the overall design of the monsters was amazing. It almost felt as if the story was too large to put into a 2 hour movie so they had to cut corners. You hardly get to see some of the other titans as a result. I also love how they're getting better at capturing the grand scale at which everything is happening, because in most movies it still feels like a CGI town being torn down, not a real one.   Still, as a point of improvement that I also notice in other movies is that they need to do some more research on how to mimic gravity when it comes to large scale monsters. When they fall it still feels like a rubber toy drops onto a fake building and casually cuts through them like butter. We're talking bricks, concrete, and harsh forces of nature here, like a meteor crushing the crust of the earth. As a human you don't just protect yourself from that from putting your arm in front of your face.

2019-09-03T07:35:37,"I realized how bad this movie sucked 9 minutes, 31 seconds in. Why was her only surviving child allowed to roam freely in a top secret, government facility that was housing some goddamn monster they knew virtually nothing about? I didn't see anyone elses kids in there. One child was already dead because of these things, so her brilliant idea was to bring her last child alive, into this place to watch this thing be born? Really?   I'm at 24 minutes, 6 seconds now and according to the movie thus far, women are the vastly superior people, *_AT EVERYTHING_*  (big leftist, SJW surprise, I know).   Women lead the science program. Women head the government inquiry. Women pilot the plane/copter. Women lead the military unit to go after the big fucking caterpillar thing.  Lest we forget, the token, beta boy, cuck lawyer, complete with the shitty looking, soy boy beard, being portrayed as nothing more than a whiny little weak bitch who gets shut down by everyone around him.  Why did only one man on the containment team, fire at the caterpillar when it showed aggression? They all had their weapons trained on it, yet the moment something went wrong, nobody else fired. What?  Ol drunk boy, loser, dad ""helped"" build the prototype orca thing, destroyed it, then she rebuilt the thing all by herself, implying that;  A. She is intellectually, electronically, and mechanically superior to him, and....  B. He was unnecessary to the process to begin with.  Tywin Lannister was ruthless enough to kill all the scientists, who were 99% male, (I only saw one other woman in the room), but her and her kid, who just happened to be there, inside a top secret government facility, (did I mention that?) but had the foresight and generosity of spirit to have winter coats, that fit perfectly btw, for them both to wear so they wouldn't get the sniffles. I gotta say, that was mighty white of him to do that for them.  I'm only 24 minutes in, and it already sucks my ass. Hollywood is for nothing but shit today.

I mean I get it, people like magic better then anything but how can Godzilla dive in the water that was knee deep when he was standing in it? And that water is an ocean which tends to be deeper then even Godzilla's knees so how can he stand in it??? Also it's funny how monster's sizes are changing depending on the situation. It seems like the closer camera gets to the monster the smaller it becomes. But I just can't stand the fact that they trying to ""explain"" these monsters in scientific language but all of them are violating the rules of physics.

But then in the post-credit scene we saw that man buying the head of the hydra.He'll surely resurrect hydra,and hydra will be powerfull than ever!

Now the Visual Effects are stunning from the birth of Mothra and the resurrection of Godzilla. The music composed by Bear McCreary is incredible that directly links with the spiritual themes of the story specifically King Ghidorah's declaration as the new Alpha of the Titans with the cross silhouetted in shadow and fire. The villains Alan Jonah and King Ghidorah are mirror reflections of each other, Alan wanted to fix humanity whose ravaging Earth and Ghidorah wanted to rebuild the planet in his image; the Kajiu action scenes are amazing for example Godzilla and King Ghidorah's faceoff in the Arctic.

I loved Godzilla King of the Monsters. So much nostalgia in one movie. I mean my god Godzilla‚Äôs roar is fantastic like always, Mothra looked so beautiful and terrifying at the same time, Rodan while underused was still great and had a good design...BUT...King Ghidorah my god they did such a good job on him I was shaking in my seat. They remixed his OG ROAR, remixed his OG Theme and he‚Äôs fucking huge and terrifying. He looks so fucking bad ass. And they made him super violent which I really liked I wanted previous Godzilla movies to do that but luckily I got my wish with this movie. And the fact that his middle head got a name and was a center point to the fight made me smile. In Destroy All Monsters King Ghidorah‚Äôs middle head was damaged the most and was the first part of his body to die & in Godzilla Vs King Ghidorah his middle head gets blown off just like in this movie!!! And they kinda hinted and making maybe a Mecha King Ghidorah in the future HOPEFULLY! On top of all of that there‚Äôs just so many other Easter eggs in this movie i can‚Äôt name them all but I‚Äôm just very happy that Godzilla King of the Monsters did pretty good with critics and did well with fans but honestly they don‚Äôt matter, as long as I enjoyed the movie and I did.
