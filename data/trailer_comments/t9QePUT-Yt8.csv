2018-03-13T04:57:56,"Hollywood  are such Hippocrates when they're making movies of violence,  have bodyguards with guns, and tell the rest of the public they want gun control.  So people can't defend themselves against criminals.   Who choose to hurt and even kill us in America. That's what Muslim Activist  Barack Hussein Obama wanted, when he was bringing in his Muslim Brotherhood of treacherous terrorist as refugees to invade overtake our Government and Country America. Democrats Liberals Leftist Lawless Corrupted Anti- America Politicians  a bunch of hypocrites wanting gun control where they themselves have bodyguards, to protect them and keeping them safe from harms way..   If Hollywood and Politicians wants to talk about gun control. ? Then they shouldn't have bodyguards and be just as vulnerable as the rest of the population.   Only the President and Vice President should have Bodyguards.        It is total hypocrisy When they  make movies with violence and promote them. They should be making movies without violence , like family movies about Animals and movies that touch the hearts of people  instead of promoting violence .  We would  probably have a better Society , rather than being a bunch of hypocrites , making sure that they have bodyguards to protect them.   The worst are the politicians not wanting allowing the right's of healthy minded people , who are highly  trained to protect themselves and others in danger.   The same Politicians who are fighting against our imagination law's , Who are the most lawless politicians Democrats leftist liberals that want to let in  Mexican Criminals who have killed our American Citizens in their drug cartels , gang's , and all violent behavior.  Don't want to allow American citizens to protect themselves against criminals who mean  harm to our American citizens from other countries such as Mexican Cartels , human trafficking, Gang's,  Muslim terrorists, and  Terrorism foreign and domestic. Criminals  hurt many even killing our American Citizens.  Yes we need to do back ground checks on anyone buying guns. Especially with violent behavior and low self-esteem wanting a few minutes of fame through violence and Media Exposure, because the media loves to glorify Violence and Violent behavior.  Criminals don't buy guns legally , but they have them anyway. They use them for criminal activity and taking our Rights to buy guns legally to defend ourselves against criminals is not the answer, and  leaving Law Abiding American Citizens Venerable to be killed by Criminals , by  Gang's on Streets, Muslim terrorists who don't respect human  life . Who are against our Law's , Constitution ,and Rights is totally insanity.   The reason I am taking about this , is we in America have Every Right to protect ourselves against criminals of any kind. Don't ever let Lawless Democrats Liberals try to take our American citizens Right's away because we would be in danger of any and all Criminals Activities.  We need GOD Jesus Christ Yeshua Almighty in our lives and Country America.  America is destroying it's Self because America doesn't want GOD Jesus Christ Yeshua Almighty anymore and people have made a GOD of their own choice.",0,0,Suzann Puppies are precious,t9QePUT-Yt8,0.001071428571428562,2018-03-13 04:57:56,True,True

Had this movie had someone like Chris Hemsworth, Taron Egerton, Leonardo Dicaprio or even Ewan McGregor in the lead, I would have gone to see it. Cause they as actors delivers something more to the characters they play than just muscles and tough or cool talk. For a premise like this to work, it cant be too predictable - as will be the case with the Rock running around from fight to fight amid explosions and fires. Because he is so identified with the exaggerated hero type as he is, it wont be a question of if or how he will succeed, but how long it will take. With one of the others I mentioned in the part instead, the character would have come across as more of a father, husband and security consultant, than as a hero - and the heroics would have been tuned down in favor of more realistic action, making the movie as a whole both more suspenseful and the lead character easier to identify with for the audience.",55,13,Tvjunkieful12,t9QePUT-Yt8,0.10814814814814815,2018-04-18 09:43:13,True,True

2018-07-13T00:08:53,"Translated from Dutch with Google translation CREDIBILITY A little girl is abandoned by her father after he had delivered her to a monastery. In the monastery she is locked up in a box with a large lock on it. A big fat monk looks at her meager stuff. But the little girl knows how to break out of the coffin and there is a fight on life-and-death with the monk. watch this is of course a fragment from an American TV series; but it has been specially subscribed to the acting performance and especially to its skills in fighting. Look, in films the fighting fights are always greatly exaggerated, but in this scene with the girl it is precisely chosen to restrict the real fighting skills of the young girl; otherwise the monk would not have had a chance against this small veht machine if it were real.

2019-04-30T11:23:23,"‚úåÔ∏è A Book You Can Believe In ‚úåÔ∏è  In the name of God, the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.  The word ‚Äòqur‚Äôan‚Äô means ‚Äòrecitation‚Äô, and the first verse of the Qur‚Äôan to be revealed by the Angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad (Ô∑∫) was a command to ‚ÄòRead (or recite)! In the name of your Lord‚Ä¶‚Äô This directive to a man who, like most people of the time, could neither read nor write, marked the beginning of a new age in human communication, learning, and development. Whereas earlier Scriptures had been written and passed down by elite circles of priests and scribes ‚Äì usually long after the death of the religion‚Äôs founder ‚Äì the preservation of the Qur‚Äôan was a community effort from the beginning, and it was completed during the Prophet Muhammad‚Äôs (Ô∑∫) own lifetime. The Prophet‚Äôs (Ô∑∫) early followers eagerly memorised and recorded each new revelation as it was revealed; by the time he passed away, thousands had memorised the entire Qur‚Äôan by heart. Within two years after the Prophet‚Äôs death, the first caliph Abu Bakr requested the Prophet‚Äôs (Ô∑∫) secretary Zayd to collect all existing copies and fragments of the Qur‚Äôan in one place, in order to compile a standard edition. This manuscript became the basis for the authorised editions that were distributed to each Muslim province during the rule of ‚ÄòUthman, third caliph; remarkably, a few of those early manuscripts have been preserved and can still be viewed in museums today.  Like all books, the Qur'an is a means to convey a message - in this case, a very special message from the Creator to all humanity. The Qur'an is an 'owner's manual for the human being'; whoever wonders about the purpose of life and their own existence will find it to be a guide par excellence. Building on prior revelations, this Final Testament confirms the age-old truths of previous Scriptures, but clarifies points of faith where error or confusion have crept into them over the centuries. Those who have read the Bible will find much that is familiar: descriptions of God's handiwork; stories of the Prophets, Satan, angels and the Day of Judgement; moral and ethical guidelines; and spiritual practices like prayer and fasting. Yet the Qur'an is not just a re-hashing of old stories; its perspective is unique and fresh, and its worldview eminently suited to people of today.  ‚úåÔ∏è The Qur'an: unique among Scriptures: The Qur'an is the most often-read book in the world. Revealed by God to the Prophet Muhammad (Ô∑∫) in the 7th century, and revered by Muslims as being God's final Scripture and Testament, its words have been lovingly recited, memorised, and implemented by Muslims of every nationality ever since. The faithful are inspired, consoled often moved to tears by its eloquence and poetic imagery, especially when recited aloud. And yet, the Qur'an is unique in being the only Scripture that is free of scientific inaccuracies, whose historical authenticity can be verified, and whose text has been so carefully preserved that just one authorised version (in Arabic) exists. Approximately the length of the New Testament, the Qur'an is also the only holy book that can be memorised in its entirety by people of all ages and intellectual abilities - including non-Arabic speakers - which Muslims consider to be one of its miracles. We invite you to take a few minutes to learn something about a book that is the foundation of the world-view and culture of almost one-fourth of the people on this planet.  ‚úåÔ∏è A scientific Scripture for a scientific age: One of the most remarkable things about the Qur'an is that it contains many verses which accurately describe natural phenomenon in various fields such as embryology, meteorology, astronomy, geology and oceanography. Scientists have found its descriptions to be inexplicably valid for a book dating from the 6th century; in fact, many of the processes and functions mentioned in the Qur'an have been discovered only recently. This fact alone has been the cause of a number of distinguished scientists embracing Islam. It also explains why the conflicts that emerged in Europe during the Middle Ages between faith and reason, religion and science, never arose in Islam; the Qur'an repeatedly encourages people to reflect and use their intelligence, and most Muslim scientists and inventors have also been pious believers.  Some of the Qur'an's 'scientific' verses include an accurate description of embryonic development during the first forty days of life; an explanation that the roots of mountains are like pegs which help to anchor and stabilise the earth's crust; that a natural barrier exists wherever two seas meet (each maintains its own salinity, temperature and density); that waves occur in layers in the depths of the ocean; that the heavens and earth were first joined together before being split apart; and that the heavens emerged from 'smoke', i.e. the gases and dust that characterise nebulas as stars are forming.  The Qur'an was never meant to be a 'science textbook'; whether highlighting the wonders of nature or the lessons of history, its verses direct us to reflect on the glory of God. However, no other ancient book or Scripture is accurate in this way. Muslims believe that this is one of the Qur'an's proofs; one of the things that makes it a credible, 'living revelation' for a modern age, and allows it to reveal itself afresh with passing time.   ‚úåÔ∏è The Qur'an and the development of knowledge: Following the example of the beloved Prophet (Ô∑∫), who encouraged all Muslims, male and female, to seek beneficial knowledge, mosques became centres of learning as well as prayer. The concept of universal, free basic education originated in Islam; children learned to read, write, memorise the Qur'an and do basic maths at village mosque schools; bright students were sent to cities to pursue higher education. The world's first universities, hospitals, and postal services were established by Muslims. Early caliphs set up institutions like the 'House of Wisdom' in Baghdad, where scholars were paid to translate scientific, literary and religious works from every known language into Arabic. It was this open-mindedness that inspired Jews and Christians under Muslim rule in Spain to translate classical Roman and Greek texts from Arabic into European languages, sparking the European Renaissance.  ‚úåÔ∏è A book with a message and a purpose: To give one example, according to the Qur'an, God held Adam and Eve jointly responsible for tasting the forbidden fruit; no special curse was laid on Eve for leading Adam astray, and no 'original sin' came into being, to be inherited for all time by innocent children. Adam and Eve simply sought His forgiveness and were forgiven, and Adam (peace be upon him) is respected in Islam as the first Prophet.  There are other important distinctions between the Qur'an and the Bible; the Qur'an asserts that much of the original books of the Bible and other Scriptures have been lost or corrupted over time (whether through warfare, political intrigue, religious schisms or other reasons). One only has to consider the number of different versions of the Bible in use today, the lack of 'first' originals, and the late discovery of long-lost Scriptures like the Dead Sea Scrolls to realise that this viewpoint is an objective one. The Qur'an rejects the concept of salvation or special privilege based on ethnicity; God does not discriminate on the basis of race or colour. It also denies the need for the sacrifice of innocent life - animal or human - in order for people to attain salvation. It states that Jesus (peace be upon him) was not crucified as claimed, but that God saved him from his enemies, as one would expect of God's honoured and beloved Messenger; his life was meant to be an inspiring example. Spiritual salvation is to be achieved solely through humble repentance, coupled by an attempt to make amends for one's sins, and a sincere intention not to repeat one's mistakes in the future. There is no official priesthood in Islam, and the Imam is no more than a knowledgeable prayer-leader and brother in faith; one's sins need only be confessed directly to the Creator.  The Qur'an's main message is to call people to turn to the Source of all being and the Giver of life, and to serve Him with a pure heart, free of idolatry or superstition. In Islam, 'One God' means just that: there is no concept of trinity, or anything else to complicate one's understanding. Like the single nucleus of a cell or an atom, He Alone is the 'control centre' behind it all; anything else would lead to chaos and confusion. God is Unique and without partner; He was not born and did not give birth; He is All-Compassionate and Merciful, Almighty and Just, and the only One we need turn to for guidance and help. Anything that we allow to come between ourselves and our Creator - even our own egos - is an idol.

2020-03-02T04:46:53,"Just finished watching this movie on CraveTV. The storyline was okay, but I thought the Rocks performance was one of the best he's given (along with Gridiron Gang). This is probably the only movie he's done  whereby you're really rooting for him. Maybe it has something to do with the vulnerability of his character having only one leg and still managing to get it done. Okay the movie is really far fetched, but I'm a softy for the underdog. The dynamic between the Rock and Neve I thought was really believable. I'd give the movie a seven and a half out of 10.",0,0,Dwight White,t9QePUT-Yt8,0.26333333333333336,2020-03-02 04:46:53,False,False
