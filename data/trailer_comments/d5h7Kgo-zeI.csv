The reality is, in most countries on planet earth, this kind of story happens so often, people just gets numb about it: No one is able to reveal the truth, the ones that get remotely close get vaporized. It won't appear on newspaper and there will not be a single word about it in any historical document.

2017-07-26T04:47:39,"Looks like a good movie it is just clearly selective on which parts of the riots its going to show to make it seem like white people just started killing blacks for no reason. Like the fact that the riots started when a large group of African-Americans attacked police officers while they were making a mass arrest of African Americans running an illegal bar which if you run an illegal bar is totally justified for arrest. Or that once the riots started they administered a curfew and instead of following it a lot of African Americans started looting local businesses who had nothing to do with the arrests and started shooting random white people, store owners who were trying to stop their stores from being robbed, police officers who were responding to sniper fire, and firefighters who were trying to rally people to help. I guarantee those parts won’t be shown. And in most cases where black were shot and killed its because they were trying to loot stores or break roadblocks or just generally not following police orders. I really wish this movie would show these parts of the riots but I promise it won’t. Also not to mention the fact that if you are in a city in a state of emergency and a lot of innocent people have been killed you shouldn’t be shooting any kind of firearm whether it be real or a starter pistol. These police responded because they were afraid of a sniper killing more people. And when the police did show up to the motel instead of telling the police where the pistol was immediately and ending the issue then and there they waited until the situation escalated and got out of hand before finally admitted one of them had a fake pistol. So yeah it seems like an interesting movie it will just clearly be very biased against white people and won’t show a lot of the actual events that took place like a lot of the black on white crime and blacks refusal to follow direct orders and continue to loot, rob and kill innocent people.",1,1,Tim Robinson,d5h7Kgo-zeI,0.04947089947089947,2017-07-26 04:47:39,False,True

I really wish this wasn't being watched everywhere and being praised for any reason because it's a black death spectacle. 2. That's it. 3. Please ask me what I mean by black death spectacle because even I don't know what I mean. 4. If anybody thinks me caring about this is stupid, I agree. 5. Wait, no I don't! I walked into this movie thinking it was War of the Planet of the Apes because I went in the wrong theater. I want you to know this story, Detroit movie! I had no idea the movie Detroit existed. So I'm sitting there in the theater, right? And I'm like, this doesn't seem like War of the Planet of the Apes. But then Wonder Woman didn't seem like Wonder Woman either. I was like, this is it. All adventure movies are going to be like this now, with some dire grab you modern day relevance thing. And then there was that scene where the little girl gets blown up. Spoiler alert! This movie has lots of scenes of quick black violence! Don't go! It's disgusting to remember the images and I don't feel any more or less like I experienced what it was like to live through the Detroit riots because I never lived through the Detroit riots just this evil movie don't go!! I saw the beginning twice and left but I wish I hadn't seen any of it! I thought I was in War of the Planet of the Apes! That's what makes this whole thing so weird. So I was sitting there feeling outraged that War of the Planet of the Apes would go to such lengths to amp up the action in their movie with all this violence against black people (from white people, of course, but most of the footage is of black people, black death spectacle, but also black humiliation spectacle, black anger spectacle, black lots of stuff spectacle, white empathy spectacle, white self-righteousness spectacle). I was so angry at the other people in the theater for not feeling he same way I did about War of the Planet of the Apes starting this way! But also that this can't be this movie. So I looked and low and behold it was Detroit! Which I hadn't heard of at all, though I was a fan of The Hurt Locker (before seeing this movie, Detroit, the beginning of it, which I saw twice). And then I went to War of the Planet of the Apes! But the next day, yesterday, I went back to the theater and saw Detroit knowing more about it. It was weird that I didn't know about the controversy (controversy?! it's a black death spectacle) because the issue is so similar to the Whitney painting thing I already knew about. So the second time I tried to watch the movie, the first real time, I stayed until the black guy singing, he is always singing, black singing spectacle, in the hotel room with his friend, finding shelter from the rioting, start talking about his record deal. BLACK DEATH SPECTACLE It really is. But also all those other things. But yeah! Black death spectacle! It brings me no joy to know that this is a black death spectacle or to use that phrase over and over again, but this movie is a black death spectacle! And this movie IS a black death spectacle! Sitting there in the theater watching a black death spectacle is worse than my sitting here using the phrase black death spectacle. It is though! I'm scarred! And I still will never know what it's like to have been in Detroit in 1967! Why does this movie exist? Why are people seeing this movie and thinking it's making the better people?
