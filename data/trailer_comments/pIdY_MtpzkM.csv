The soundtrack is on point (I especially like the fact that they included quite a few spoken songs here and there) and fits perfectly the events and settings, settings which are original and totally GORGEOUS. Maybe the fact that Sabo and Lucci didn't really fight was kind of a let down, but the rest of the movie was too good for that to matter. And lastly the plot was just amazing, although classic One Piece, it was always so tense that it managed to keep me on my toes the whole way through. Finally the animation was totally ON POINT, and with that, the intro is so so Taking, that even if the rest of the movie had been bad i would have acclaimed it just for that. Here, that's my opinion.
