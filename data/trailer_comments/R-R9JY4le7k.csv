2015-07-10T04:08:46,With the changes that are happening in america I would think that we are moving towards a more accepting nation.Or at least that is what is being toted by the media and the youth and under 35 age range. But all I see from you and the vast majority is a complete lack of tolerance and equality and respect and beliefs of all not just the minorities and there religions but for all. So I urge you back up your hollow and vacant words with actions or sheath your sharp and intolerant tongue until you can control your narrow minded and hypocritical statements. Ones faith is their right and if someone wants to make a movie about it than so be it but do not strike it down just because of your lack of faith or understanding or beliefs. It is not your place to comment even if someone else does. you all seek equality but equality is not just for the oppressed but the masses in its entirety. After all these are the principals that our country was founded on. Without these we would not be able to make such statements. So remind your self's what we have the right to do and yes speech is one but not to a point to where it is purposefully degrading or harmful. We are a nation of morals kindness at our core and it is about time we start acting like it.,2,0,Daniel Carpenter,R-R9JY4le7k,0.06605820105820107,2015-07-10 04:08:46,True,True

Once nailed to the pole and hung upright a victim couldn't ""lift"" their body to breathe without great pain. This caused the victim to slowly suffocate to death. In order to speed up the process Roman soldiers would routinely break the legs for anyone who didn't die from suffocation fast enough.  In the original Greek the Gospel writers used the word Stauros (σταυρός) which denotes an upright pale, pole, or stake. Even the Latin word crux means a mere stake.  The crossbeam, appearing as the letter ""T"", is an ancient pagan symbol for the initial letter of the Pagan God Tammuz; who was the deified Nimrod.

2016-01-12T19:43:10,"To clear the confusion:  Where is the movie on Dionysis? Where is the movie on Ceres, Vulkan, Zeus, Mars, Appolo, Venus, and co? Where is the movie on Amaterasu, Izanami and Izanagi? Where is the movie on Thor and Odin? Where is the movie on El or Baal. Where is the movie on Old Man?  The only reason this bland story is getting relentlessly recycled past reconciliation is because people take it seriously. When in doubt, look at the evidence. In the same way that myths have formed 'evidence' for Perseus, Prometheus, Icarus, the fore mentioned, and literally legions more of characters, one can say that the gospels are 'evidence' for Jesus. But that doesn't work. What then does history say? Actually, save a brief mention which itself is in question, Jesus seems only feasibly to be fictitious. Let me set the stage. Our story begins with a baby and a King Herod slaughtering all infants under the age of two. No such event has ever been listed by historians and this point is only mentioned in a single gospel. When Jesus grows up, he leads thousands as he spreads his word. And yet he's not popular enough to make it into the works of historians. Ancient Rome is actually the best well documented time in history of the ancient world and several 'messiahs' in Jesus's time were mentioned by historians, just not Jesus. When he dies, the day turns dark and many rise up from the dead. Not a mention.  The truth is the gospels were written decades after the alleged event and it shows. Pilate, for instance, is portrayed horribly inaccurately. So why do we have this story? Why do we have any? The gospels began to be written roughly around the year 70. The temple was being destroyed and Vespassian started the first Roman-Jewish war, with his son Titus succeeding him and starting the second. History has shown that in traumatic times, apocalyptic writings flourish, especially ones pertaining to a saviour.  One last argument. Mark, Matthew and Luke have surprised scholars on their similarities. Literally entire chapters have been taken from one word-by-word from the other. The only way this could have happened is if they had the previously 'published' gospel by them as they wrote theirs. So why deliberately change the story? Why 'plagiarize' a text and decide to add your own spin on it? Because that's how fiction works.  Yes, I'm an atheist, but I'm not evil. It was in fact my moral obligation to become an atheist, rather than believe in a paradoxical deity who commands blood sacrifices, condones slavery, condones rape, kills people for collecting sticks on sabbaths, and floods all of humanity.",1,5,Thomas Parker,R-R9JY4le7k,0.018076441102756895,2016-01-12 19:43:10,True,True

After Jesus died and was buried in a tomb that belonged to Joseph of Arimethea, the leaders of  the Sanhedrin went to see Pilate with a demand.They asked him to place a round the clock guard by the grave of Jesus that would last the three days following the death of Jesus. Pilate asked why he should do this. They told him they were afraid the disciples of Jesus would try to move His Body and make the people believe Jesus had risen from the dead as He had said He would three days after His death. Pilate agreed he would do this and placed four guards around the tomb where Jesus was buried. They were replaced around the clock and seals were placed on the rock that sealed the grave. After dawn on Sunday the guards found the stone was rolled back and there was no body in the tomb.A man standijg in the tomb told the guard that Jesus was no longer there, and had risen from the dead. The guards reported what had happened and what they were told. The leaders of the Sanhedrin wanted the guards to say they had left their posts or fallen but Pilate supported the guards. By the time Pilate and the guards came back to the tomb te women the Bible mention (Mary Magdeline and Mary mother of Jesus) had arrived and told them an angel had told them Jesus had risen. The guards came to Pilate later that day and told him they had been approached by the Sanhedrine, wanting to bribe thd guards to state that Jesus was moved from the tomb. They and Pilate refused!

2016-02-19T19:31:49,"THE DEFT POLITICAL MANEUVERINGS OF JESUS AND JEWISH OFFICIALS UNDER A PRECARIOUS ROMAN SHADOW  The existence of a Roman occupation throughout the Levant circa 30 AD precluded Jewish authorities in Judea and Galilee-Perea openly accepting Jesus as the Messiah. If Jesus was realized to be the Messiah, the Jewish authorities in Judea and Galilee would have played a game of feigned hostility towards Jesus, thereby placating an always watchful Rome that dealt swiftly with even perceived threats to Roman rule. We see then that the Gospels’ narrative of Jewish officialdom hostility towards Jesus’ ministry is behavior one would expect from those officials. Is there, then, within the Gospels themselves evidence of Jewish officialdom’s acceptance and knowledge of Jesus’ claim to the Messiah? In fact, there’s direct evidence.  When Jesus was in Jerusalem on His first mission there early in His ministry period, the Pharisee named Nicodemus paid Jesus a discreet visit at night informing Jesus that the Temple leaders knew Jesus was sent from God. Nicodemus admits, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with Him.”  Continue reading article at my blog...  https://sites.google.com/site/deanjackson60/  Also read follow-up article, ""The Empire 'Halfheartedly' Strikes Back"".",0,0,Dean Jackson,R-R9JY4le7k,0.049999999999999996,2016-02-19 19:31:49,False,True

But I was surprised in such a positive, nice way for 3 reasons: 1) Forget about a blonde, blue-eyed viking as Jesus. We see truer historical accuracy here, with a Jesus that looks Jewish and very similar to the scientific reconstructions of men of his time.  2) This is NOT religious movie made to sell the figure of the Christ, but a detectivesque thriller with  a few action sequences, told from a very fresh perspective: that of a pagan, skeptical Roman soldier. You even get to see in a very clear way never told before the political maneuvers regarding the Jewish Sanderin, the Romans and the Zealot rebels. 3) The focus of the movie is not the death and torture of Jesus, either, which is something that pulled me away from religion personally. This is the first movie in which the perspective is the actual message of Jesus and his resurrection and ascension, and yet, it never becomes lame and religious. The climatic scene, for example, is the transfiguration of Jesus. I've never seen such a frontal, direct scene depicting this event, and yet, it was beautifully done.
