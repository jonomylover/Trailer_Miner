2017-07-20T18:03:28,"I just don't know how to feel about this... The way it's shot feels so different from the previous 7, the use of an upbeat song in the latter half of the trailer gives off the vibe that they are going for more of a fun movie (like Final Destination) as opposed to the super serious dark stuff that the previous movies had (sans saw 3d).  It doesn't feel like SAW.  It feels like... a knockoff of SAW, not a true SAW.  If it's any consolation, it does look better than saw 3d.  But definitely looks to be its own kind of vibe and universe as opposed to being a dark and twisted affair like the first six.    I'm what you would call a superfan of the series, but I disowned saw 3d since it is a piece of shit in every way, and bordering on offensive to the fans that got the series to that point.  It was just awful, especially disappointing after the stellar SAW VI.    JigSAW is not looking great, though.  I especially hate that line about ""Well that's not creepy.""  Can we not add one-liner quips into the series?  This isn't a Marvel or Star Wars movie.  SAW doesn't need quips and humor.  It needs a stellar storyline that some people will consider convoluted and contrived, traps that have deep metaphorical meaning, amazing twists that make you rethink the entire film, and incredible Charlie Clouser music to round it all out.  Based on this trailer, I feel like only a couple of those criteria will be ticked off the list.  It honestly feels like a direct-to-DVD movie.  Long story short, coming from a SAW superfan, I will of course give this movie a chance, it does look better than saw 3d, but this does not look like the incredible return to form that I think a lot of us were hoping for.  This definitely won't be topping SAW VI as my favorite, that's for sure.",1,0,Paul W,fcb68kAOvt4,0.07848837209302327,2017-07-20 18:03:28,True,True

2017-07-20T21:14:44,"Jesus Christ is the son of God and he died on the cross to save you from your sins and rose from the dead so if you believe in him you shall not perish but have eternal life though him. We all have sinned and fall short to God's infinite glory. Jesus was perfect and helped the poor, he wanted unity, he taught love and compassion, and he never committed any crimes. Jesus knew no sin yet he died on the cross to save you from your sins for your behalf. Jesus didn't just die physical death he also experienced separation from God his father during his time on the cross and he was in pain and the time before his death he was in sorrow because he allowed this too happen for yout sake and that you could be saved though the shedding of his blood. Jesus did this because he loves you so much and it's overwhelming and is like your the only thing in all existence that he loves. God would never give up, forsake, or leave you no matter what, he would always take care and remain faithful to you. God would comfort you in times of need and help you in any area of your life. Also God would give you a purpose for this life and the life to come.This life is only temporary and goes by fast but the life to come is eternal. I lied, stole, looked at porn and I still make mistakes but I started to read the Bible and the more I read it, the more my heart and life began to change for the better. I'm grateful for such an amazing and loving God, out of the grace, mercy and love of God I'm saved from my sins, not because of anything I've done, I was deserving of punishment. Repent and follow Jesus because he's the only hope for your salvation and the only one who could have you from hell and eternal separation from a holy God. God will come and judge those who don't repent of their sins, because they have have not believed in Jesus the savior, so therefore have refused to be saved and because of that they have not been saved or forgiven of their sins. Jesus will return with the angels and the clouds of heaven and will gather his faithful followers. They will live in a new Earth where everything is restored and Perfect and there will be no more mourning, death, pain, sadness, suffering, sickness, or lost. There will be eternally great love, peace and joy beyond comparison and beyond comprehension, this will all belong to those who have faith in Jesus, those who don't believe will not enter God's kingdom. If you truly place your faith in Jesus, God will prove how big he really is. If you have questions or want me to pray for anything I'm always here for you. Also I have a video called God loves all:message. God bless you and I hope you have a great and wonderful rest of your year!:)",0,0,brandon caruso,fcb68kAOvt4,0.332177033492823,2017-07-20 21:14:44,True,True

Main game is 5 people with chains round their necks are tasked with stopping themselves dying to sawblades. 1 of them dies to this and the helmets come off. The 4 survivors see the jigsaw puppet and recall their sins like always. They have to stop themselves from being pulled into that oven like ring, and the black guy dies leaving blonde, brunette and sweatpants. They are released from neck chains but have to inject themselves with something to escape (probably a poision you need antidote for) and they walk around getting stuck stupidly in traps.

2017-07-22T02:08:22,"Saw was a game changing film for the Horror Genre, it ushered in the age of the Torture Porn film or New Wave Extremity as the French say. It made James Wan and Leigh Whannell household names in Hollywood. A slew of horror flicks afterwards as well as the Insidious and Conjuring franchises. But as the series went on, it's just became too ridiculous to believe and became bogged down in its own mythos. By the end of the series, everybody involved in the murders, those investigating them and those affected by them are dead.  Dr. Lawrence Gordon seems to be the sole survivor with him locking Det. Hoffman in the Room to die. But in Saw unless we see you die, can you really be sure? The positive thing about this film it does seem to be returning to the essentials of the first film, narrower focus and tighter storytelling. The story will be split between the Cops investigating the murders and the new group of victims in the Jigsaw ordeal. It will be interesting who has taken up John Kramer's mantle of Jigsaw. Also more Tobin Bell is always appreciate, hopefully this is a step back in the right direction for these films.",70,4,Remus0387,fcb68kAOvt4,0.09149029982363313,2017-07-22 02:08:22,True,True

These movies were genius I refuse to believe what I listed above was errors on there part...keep the twist coming but answer these remaining questions we all know Gordon wasn't the accomplice he was just helping  Amanda failed And Hoffman was not playing by the rules Have the twist be Adam was saved  Him Amanda and Gordon captured Hoffman And then they turn on Amanda throw her in the room And her and Hoffman fight to survive  Idk I rewatched them all and have toooo much time on my hands   This jigsaw movie looks good But I hope they don't forget everything from the last ones,0,0,TALKSiiCK,fcb68kAOvt4,-0.02820512820512821,2017-08-07 09:56:38,True,True

2017-10-25T22:57:06,"Really? Chumbuckets on their heads and sharp objects falling from the ceiling? the director had the idea of traps that a five year old would come up with, saw 7 was retarded the only good part was the ending when doctor Gordon from saw 1 came out. The original saw theme was do you have what it takes to survive and give sacrifice now they aren’t even going with the theme and making traps that you would have to guess or have luck with. All of the traps on a individual were unique which made the characters who died more memorable, that’s the whole point, including the flashbacks that make you understand the story more. They make sure the games can’t be won anymore like what Amanda did to her test subjects , she never gave them the chance to survive and in saw 3 it explains all of that, remember officer Kerry when she had to put her hand in the acid to get the key? She unlocked it but never survived, then you see Amanda. Remember the dude that had to rip his body from the chains? He lost but even if he did the door was welded shut. That was Amanda’s test subject, she never let any one of them get a chance and that’s why he tested her at the end of saw 3 to make her choice. Anyway I’m getting off track back to new jigsaw movie, hopefully they come up with a new interesting twist in this one and explain everything in the end since this is probably the last sequel of saw.
