It seems, in my opinion, like they have hidden sexualized characters and pretty faces behind a ""feminist"" material. This isn't feminist. Warriors need to be covered in blood and have a strong body. Those are fragile women, the propotipe of a white, pretty and sexy girl that doesn't need a man. I feel like this is a pathetic attempt to show a woman's warrior side but finishing making it another sexualization of women in the film market. Pride and Prejudice is a misogynist, conservative novel (and i'm talking of the original P&P, not the adapation) that shows us the way women were treated one hundred years ago. I can't see the purpose of this, I'm sorry. Also, some characters that were described 'ugly' in the book...here are splendidly graceful, skinny and so on.
