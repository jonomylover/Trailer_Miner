2017-03-04T17:59:46,"The old man and the sea is the story of a fight between and elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like‚Ä¶ HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son of a bitch on planet earth. Honesty, if you were in a boat for eighty four days, it‚Äôd be hard NOT to catch a fish‚Ä¶ even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as the Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄúParents just don‚Äôt understand‚Äù. So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway, ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an eldery man who talks to himself. Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food, and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio, who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs going way out into the gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady Luck is returning. On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy lunch, Santiago drops his lines and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big-ass fish. He‚Äôs sure he‚Äôs a winner. He fights and fights and fights and fights but can‚Äôt pull the monster in.Santiago‚Äôs leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he‚Äôs bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ‚ÄúBrother‚Äù or maybe even ‚ÄúBro‚Äù. It‚Äôs sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding. But on the third day, Santiago is freakin‚Äô EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a fucking harpoon. It‚Äôs a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words instead of giving in to base desires and imposing his gigantically terrible position on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical. Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, read to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding Marlin‚Äôs carcass, because as we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you‚Äôve finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to fucking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he‚Äôs still unlucky, REALLY unlucky (DUH!) Ma calls the sharks ‚Äúdream killers‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt really all that fair, I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin‚Ä¶ Jesus, don‚Äôt even get me started on the marlin. It was just hanging out one day, minding it‚Äôs own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it‚Äôs family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who‚Äôs the ‚ÄúDream killer‚Äù now, fuckface! The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said ‚Äì He‚Äôs super tired. The next morning, a group of fisherman gather around Santiago‚Äôs boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit shingles! It‚Äôs over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (Strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man. Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later there‚Äôs a Red Lobster restaurant in nearly every city in America offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.  You're welcome",1,0,Alex Katz,I4tFNfROlqk,0.07771118721461188,2017-03-04 17:59:46,True,True

2017-03-04T18:26:31,"That piece of text at the end of the trailer:  The old man and the sea is the story of a fight between and elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like... HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty four days without catching a fish because he's the unluckiest son of a bitch on planet earth. Honesty, if you were in a boat for eighty four days, it'd be hard NOT to catch a fish... even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as the Fresh Prince used to say, ""Parents just don't understand"". So the boy visits Santiago's shack anyway, ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself. Manolin helps out, moving Santiago's fishing gear, making food, and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio, who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he's going way out into the gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady Luck is returning. On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy lunch, Santiago drops his lines and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big-ass fish. He's sure he's a winner. He fights and fights and fights and fights but can't pull the monster in.Santiago's leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he's bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ""Brother"" or maybe even ""Bro"". It's sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding. But on the third day, Santiago is freakin' EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a fucking harpoon. It's a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words instead of giving in to base desires and imposing his gigantically terrible position on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical. Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, read to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding Marlin's carcass, because as we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you've finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to fucking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he's still unlucky, REALLY unlucky (DUH!) Ma calls the sharks ""dream killers"". Which isn't really all that fair, I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin... Jesus, don't even get me started on the marlin. It was just hanging out one day, minding it's own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it's family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who's the ""Dream killer"" now, fuckface! The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said - He's super tired. The next morning, a group of fisherman gather around Santiago's boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit shingles! It's over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (Strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man. Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later there's a Red Lobster restaurant in nearly every city in America offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.",0,0,Karen neeskens,I4tFNfROlqk,0.06767939814814816,2017-03-04 18:26:31,True,True

2017-03-04T19:32:36,"The license plate on the car when he is in the phone booth says 338 EIN. If we add 3+3+8 you get 14. Using the letter to number conversion EIN comes out to 4+9+14 which equals 27. 27+14=41. The 4 represents the number of people in this trailer, and the 1 represents the number of Deadpool movies there have been. Crazy, right? But why stop there? If we add 4+1 we get 5. Then we subtract 2 because that's the number of how many swords Deadpool carries to get 3. Now we add 10 because (Including Logan) that's how many X-Men movies there have been. Now we subtract 1 because everyone hates X-Men Origins. We're left with 12. Now, there are four main storylines in the X-Men movies: Wolverine, modern X-Men, Deadpool, and the First Class trilogy. If we divide 12/4 we get 3 again. Bryan Singer is a great storyteller. You know what else has a great story? Half-Life.

2017-03-04T20:42:53,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like... HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he's the unluckiest son of a bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it'd be so hard to NOT catch a fish... even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince Used to say, 'Parents Just Don't Understand.' So the boy visits Santiago's shack anyway, ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself. Manolin helps out, moving Santiago's fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio; who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he's going way out into the Gulf Stream, WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady luck is returning! On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big ass fish. HE's sure it's a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can't pull the monster in. Santiago's leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he's bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ""brother"" or maybe even, ""bro."" It's sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding. But on the third day, Santiago is freakin' EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a fucking harpoon, it's a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words, instead giving in to base desires and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subjects through unblinking violence. Typical. Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin's carcass, because as we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you've finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to fucking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but he drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he's still unlucky. REALLY unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks, ""dream killers"", Which isn't really all that fair. I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin... Jesus, don't even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding its own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for its family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who's the real ""dream killer"" now, fuckface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said - he's super tired. The next morning, a group of fishermen gather around Santiago's boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit-shingles! It's over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man. Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee and when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later, there's a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.",0,0,Joe :,I4tFNfROlqk,0.08156944444444444,2017-03-04 20:42:53,True,True

2017-03-04T21:40:45,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like... HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he's the unluckiest son of a bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it'd be hard to NOT catch a fish... even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as the Fresh Prince used to say, Parents Just Don't Understand.' So the boy visits Santiago's shack anyway. Ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself. Manolin helps out, moving Santiago's fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio; who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he's going way out into the Gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady luck is returning! On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big ass fish. He's sure it's a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can't pull the monster in. Santiago's leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights and he holds on for dear life. Even though he's bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this might adversary. He starts calling him ""brother"" or maybe even ""bro."" It's sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding. But on the third day, Santiago is freakin' EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever he wants. So he stabs it. With a fucking harpoon. It's a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words instead giving in to base desires and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical. Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin's carcass, because as we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you've finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to fucking shreds while dry humping your dignity with their crazy weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he's still unlucky. REALLY unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks ""dream killers"". Which isn't really all that fair. I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin... Jesus, don't even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding its own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for its family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who's the ""dream killer"" now, fuckface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said, he's super tired. The next morning a group of fishermen gather around Santiago's boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit shingles! It's over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man. Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later, there's a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.",0,0,F.N.N,I4tFNfROlqk,0.0496394230769231,2017-03-04 21:40:45,True,True

2017-03-05T00:32:12,"In case anyone is wondering what was written at the end of the trailer..  The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like ‚Ä¶ HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son-of-a-bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it‚Äôd be hard NOT to catch a fish ‚Ä¶ even by accident. Santiago is so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as the Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄòParents Just Don‚Äôt Understand‚Äô. So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway. Ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself, Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food, and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio, who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs going way out into the Gulf Stream, WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady luck is returning! On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big ass fish. He‚Äôs sure it‚Äôs a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can‚Äôt pull the monster in. Santiago‚Äôs leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he‚Äôs bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ‚Äúbrother‚Äù or maybe even, ‚Äúbro.‚Äù It‚Äôs sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding. But on the third day, Santiago is freakin‚Äô EXHAUSTED and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a fucking harpoon. It‚Äôs a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words‚Äîinstead giving in to base desires‚Äîand imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical. Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin‚Äôs carcass, because as we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you‚Äôve found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to fucking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he‚Äôs still unlucky, REALLY unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks ‚Äúdream killers‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt really all that fair, I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin ‚Ä¶ Jesus, don‚Äôt even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding it‚Äôs own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for its family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúdream killer‚Äù now, fuckface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said‚Äîhe‚Äôs super tired. The next morning, a group of fishermen gather around Santiago‚Äôs boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit-shingles! It‚Äôs over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man. Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later, there‚Äôs a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.",594,25,Jerome Romualdez,I4tFNfROlqk,0.07878139269406392,2017-03-05 00:32:12,True,True

Fat old lady spits down at him, calls him a cosplay pussy and turns to walk away, ice cream in hand, Deadpool watches her walk off and notices from a 1st person view her white pants are all brown and shitty on the ass from where she shit her pants multiple times and says ""never mind I take that back"", dead old man coughs up blood, he is actually still alive, looks over with one eye open, analyzes fat old lady, while she is walking off and says, ahhhhh gross dude, Deadpool looks over at him like ""I know right?""",106,32,JokerCirca66,I4tFNfROlqk,-0.10286935286935292,2017-03-05 02:01:01,True,True

2017-03-05T03:54:37,"A drug dealer, sells drugs, hoping to own his customers by getting them addicted.  From McD's to Apple Computer to Levi's jeans, ""drug dealers"" abound.  It is ""the world"", what they do. ... some, liken addictions to sexual activity, fleshly lusts.  Hence ""fuck"" can refer to  really good ice cream... A mother is somebody, or someone, who expresses unconditional love towards you, not expecting anything in return.  A mother, they say, is oft taken for granted, like the shade cast by a tree - missed, value realized, when the tree is no longer there, protecting you from the heat of the day... And so, a ""motherfucker"" would be somebody who looks upon a mother as a resource, the way some, such as drug dealers, see customers as dollar signs. But ""motherfuckers"" are worse, because they see mothers as ""dollar signs"", targets, prey, et cetra... This is not to say that it is ok to look upon some as a resource, but merely attempting to define that term, and the philosophy implied by that term.  Words can harm.  What is ""bromance""?  Beware of words which do not appear in the bible, kjv... what are they tryimg to sell you?..  Does a physician see patients, or is he a businessman looking out for his own interest?... Music... is, or may be, spiritual food... ice cream... earthly, worldly, fleshly... that pleasure passes quickly, whereas music can really help you get through a ""tough time"".  But like liquor and drugs, music can also blind you as to how bad things really are, by creating a ""high""... the woman is the weaker vessel... bribes, or gifts?  An attempt to purchase ""love""? Or do you ""see"" (some things are invisible) Jesus, and a woman breaking a bottle of perfume over his head?... colateral... parallel.. duality... Some films, the language, fits, whereas in other films, you think the words spoken subtract from the story, add nothing.  But this writing is amazing.... Comic books, how addictive?  They tend to end on a cliffhanger, or the commencement of a new storyline, so you have to get the next issue... And then one day, they raise prices... The world, is not going away... but sometimes, you can see light shining in darkness...",0,0,Kelly KitKat,I4tFNfROlqk,0.09877886002886005,2017-03-05 03:54:37,True,True

Like‚Ä¶ HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son-of-a-bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it‚Äôd be hard to NOT catch a fish‚Ä¶ even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄòParents Just Don‚Äôt Understand‚Äô. So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway.  Ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself, Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio; who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs going way out into the Gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba.

2017-03-06T06:21:45,"Text at the end: üòÅ  The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like‚Ä¶ HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son-of-a-bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it‚Äôd be hard to NOT catch a fish‚Ä¶ even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄòParents Just Don‚Äôt Understand‚Äô. So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway.  Ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself, Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio; who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs going way out into the Gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady luck is returning!  On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big ass fish. He‚Äôs sure it‚Äôs a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can‚Äôt pull the monster in. Santiago‚Äôs leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he‚Äôs bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ‚Äúbrother‚Äù or maybe even, ‚Äúbro.‚Äù It‚Äôs sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding.  But on the third day, Santiago is freakin‚Äô EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a f*cking harpoon. It‚Äôs a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words - instead giving in to base desires - and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical.  Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin‚Äôs carcass, because we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you‚Äôve finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to f*cking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin.  Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he‚Äôs still unlucky. REALLY unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks ‚Äúdream killers‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt really all that fair. I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin‚Ä¶ Jesus, don‚Äôt even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding it‚Äôs own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it‚Äôs family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúdream killer‚Äù now, f*ckface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point.  Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said - he‚Äôs super tired. The next morning a group of fishermen gather around Santiago‚Äôs boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit-shingles! It‚Äôs over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man.  Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later, there‚Äôs a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.",2,0,Michaela K,I4tFNfROlqk,0.07771677927927928,2017-03-06 06:21:45,True,True

2017-03-08T05:18:05,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like‚Ä¶ HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son-of-a-bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it‚Äôd be hard to NOT catch a fish‚Ä¶ even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄòParents Just Don‚Äôt Understand‚Äô. So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway.  Ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself, Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio; who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs going way out into the Gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady luck is returning!  Deadpool 2 Firefly Deadpool 2s Teaser Text Included an Essay on The Old Man and The Sea On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big ass fish. He‚Äôs sure it‚Äôs a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can‚Äôt pull the monster in. Santiago‚Äôs leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he‚Äôs bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ‚Äúbrother‚Äù or maybe even, ‚Äúbro.‚Äù It‚Äôs sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding.   But on the third day, Santiago is freakin‚Äô EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a f*cking harpoon. It‚Äôs a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words ‚Äì instead giving in to base desires ‚Äì and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical.  Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin‚Äôs carcass, because we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you‚Äôve finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to f*cking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin.  Deadpool 2 Teaser with Ryan Reynolds Deadpool 2s Teaser Text Included an Essay on The Old Man and The Sea  Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he‚Äôs still unlucky. REALLY unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks ‚Äúdream killers‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt really all that fair. I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin‚Ä¶ Jesus, don‚Äôt even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding it‚Äôs own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it‚Äôs family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúdream killer‚Äù now, f*ckface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point.  Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said ‚Äì he‚Äôs super tired. The next morning a group of fishermen gather around Santiago‚Äôs boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit-shingles! It‚Äôs over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man.  Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later, there‚Äôs a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.",0,0,"MySpaceBarBroke Never mind, i fixed it",I4tFNfROlqk,0.0783031798245614,2017-03-08 05:18:05,True,True

The Universe is a quantum computation inside something with zero-dimensions that exists nowhere and at no time, a point of energy that cannot be created nor destroyed (The Law of Conservation of Energy) This is the real implication of the principle of non-locality in quantum physics, which shows that space and time are not fundamental. The current Big Bang Theory therefore is wrong, as SpaceTime did not explode out from the point but rather it occurred inside.   Why is it that if you keep traveling in any direction you‚Äôll eventually end up back where you started? It seamlessly reloads. The Cosmos is self-rising, all matter and energy flows through SpaceTime in a probabilistic chaos as a unified whole towards a common destiny.   It began with the Big Bang and SpaceTime is currently undergoing inflation, which is speeding up due to the fact that there is more dark energy than dark matter inside. If this was to continue unimpeded, eventually the Universe would die from what scientists call a Big Freeze. This is impossible however because energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Instead the Universe converts dark energy into dark matter until there is more dark matter than dark energy, which will reverse inflation until SpaceTime collapses back in on itself, in what scientists call a Big Crunch which is to be followed by a new Big Bang and on and on recycling for an Eternity.   What is the purpose of Life? For all Life across the Cosmos to convert dark energy into dark matter, in order to cause what I call an Observer Collapse. Everything being unified means everything. We may seem separate but this is an illusion created by the mind. We are all, every thought and hair, unified as One. So since Life serves this function whenever it is on the verge of self-destruction, Life is given the key to saving itself for free because we exist probabilistically and the Universe is self-rising, thus it is more probable than not that we find a solution. Nature has given us purpose, we must fulfill our roles as guardians of the Cosmos. The world is on the brink of World War III. This is an automatic extinction event. We are all facing death together. Wealth and power means nothing. We must all rise up together as One and stop our governments from going to war. It is Co-operation or Extinction.

2017-03-10T22:44:20,"I think that maybe the text at the end is in refrence to the first movie (at least from what they read here). He is given a certain amount of time to live and is exhausted by the lack of help that is avaliable, like how the fisherman is tired of the fruitless endveaor of catching fish. Deadpool then leaves to somewhere unknown and catches the big fish so to say and finally gets the help he needs. What Deadpool and the fisherman don't realize is that they are in over their head and are soon commanded by someone, or something else's will, and have no choice in what happens next. Deadpool becomes emotionally stranded like the fisher man after they are dragged far from where they know. Finally they've both had enough of this monster and finish him/it off. Soon however sharks attack Santiago's skiff, possibly a metaphor for how Ajax had come to take his girlfriend and as the summary says ""...just when you think you've finally found something good and true, sharks come by to rip it to fucking shreds..."" so he is defeated it seems, especially after he thinks he's defeated Ajax but is told nothing can be done to reverse whats happened to him. But with help from others he gets his girlfriend back at the very least.......Or the Fish is his GF who he finds at first sees nothing but a fish, or sex buddy. He soon relizes there is more to her and finally he has something ""Good and just"" in his life, but then the doctors tell him he has cancer and he sees them as the so called ""Dream Killers"" like in the summary, when really they are just doing they're job.",0,0,Chagrin Chap,I4tFNfROlqk,0.0857374768089054,2017-03-10 22:44:20,True,True

2017-03-11T05:18:50,"*Transcription of the text because I was bored. Idk if someone did that before*  ""The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like... Huge. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he's the unluckiest son-of-a-bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it's be hard to NOT catch a fish... even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say, 'Parents Just Don't Understand'. Do the boy visits Santiago's shack anyway. Ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself, Manolin helps out, moving Santiago's fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio; who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The nest day, Santiago tells Manolin that he's going way out into the Gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of cuba. Lady luck is returning! On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big-ass fish. He's sure it's a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can't pull the monster in. Santiago's leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even tough he's bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ""brother"" or maybe even, ""bro"". It's sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding. but on the third day, Santiago is freakin' EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he sayd and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a fucking harpoon. It's a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words - instead giving in to base desires - and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subject trough unblinking violence. Typical. Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin's carcass, because we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you've finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to fucking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. Be nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he's still unlucky, REALLY unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks, ""dream killers"". Which isn't rally all that fair. I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin... Jesus, don't even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding it's own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it's family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who's the ""dream killer"" now, fuckface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes i ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said - he's super tired. The nest morning, a group of fishermen gather around Santiago's boat. One measures the skeleton and, hoyl shit-shingles! It's over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man. Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. many years later, there's a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.""",1,0,Mari,I4tFNfROlqk,0.06162712191358023,2017-03-11 05:18:50,True,True

2017-03-11T21:35:45,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like‚Ä¶ HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son-of-a-bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it‚Äôd be hard to NOT catch a fish‚Ä¶ even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄòParents Just Don‚Äôt Understand‚Äô. So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway.  Ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself, Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio; who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs going way out into the Gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady luck is returning!  On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big ass fish. He‚Äôs sure it‚Äôs a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can‚Äôt pull the monster in. Santiago‚Äôs leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he‚Äôs bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ‚Äúbrother‚Äù or maybe even, ‚Äúbro.‚Äù It‚Äôs sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding.  But on the third day, Santiago is freakin‚Äô EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a f*cking harpoon. It‚Äôs a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words ‚Äì instead giving in to base desires ‚Äì and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical.  Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin‚Äôs carcass, because we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you‚Äôve finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to f*cking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin.  Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he‚Äôs still unlucky. REALLY unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks ‚Äúdream killers‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt really all that fair. I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin‚Ä¶ Jesus, don‚Äôt even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding it‚Äôs own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it‚Äôs family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúdream killer‚Äù now, f*ckface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point.  Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said ‚Äì he‚Äôs super tired. The next morning a group of fishermen gather around Santiago‚Äôs boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit-shingles! It‚Äôs over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man.  Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later, there‚Äôs a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.",1,0,Slenderbanana880,I4tFNfROlqk,0.07771677927927928,2017-03-11 21:35:45,True,True

2017-03-13T06:18:49,"Here‚Äôs the text for your reading pleasure. Note that it contains not-safe-for-work language.  ‚ÄúThe Old Man and the Sea‚Äù is the story of a fight between an elderly accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like‚Ä¶ HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son of a bitch on planet earth. Honestly if you were in a boat for eighty four days, it‚Äôd be hard NOT to catch a fish‚Ä¶ even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄúParents Just Don‚Äôt Understand.‚Äù  So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway, ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself. Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio, who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs¬†going out into the Gulf Stream, WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady lucky is returning!  On the eighty fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big ass fish. He‚Äôs sure it‚Äôs a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can‚Äôt pull the monster in. Santiago‚Äôs leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he‚Äôs bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ‚Äúbrother‚Äù or maybe even, ‚Äúbro.‚Äù It‚Äôs sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the¬†reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding.  But on the third day, Santiago is freakin‚Äô EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a f‚Äîing harpoon. It‚Äôs a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words ‚Äî instead giving into base desires ‚Äî and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subect through unblinking violence. Typical. Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hit the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price.  But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin‚Äôs carcass, because as we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you‚Äôve finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to f‚Äîing shreds while dry humping your dignity with their crazy weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness.  Santiago realizes he‚Äôs still unlucky. Really unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks ‚Äúdream killers.‚Äù Which isn‚Äôt really all that fair, I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin‚Ä¶ Jesus, don‚Äôt even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding its own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for its family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúdream killer‚Äù now, f‚Äîface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said ‚Äî he‚Äôs super tired.  The next morning, a group of fishermen gather around Santiago‚Äôs boat. One measures the skeleton, and, holy shit shingles! It‚Äôs over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man. Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again.  Many years later, there‚Äôs a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.",0,0,Night Hawk,I4tFNfROlqk,0.07863906926406923,2017-03-13 06:18:49,True,True

2017-03-18T02:26:38,"Creepy crawly Man is an anecdotal superhero showing up in American comic books distributed by Marvel Comics. The character was made by essayist supervisor Stan Lee and author craftsman Steve Ditko, and initially showed up in the collection comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Lee and Ditko imagined the character as a vagrant being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and as a young person, dealing with the ordinary battles of pre-adulthood notwithstanding those of a costumed wrongdoing contender. Insect Man's makers gave him super quality and readiness, the capacity to stick to most surfaces, shoot bug catching networks utilizing wrist-mounted gadgets of his own development, which he calls ""web-shooters"", and respond to risk rapidly with his ""creepy crawly sense"", empowering him to battle his adversaries.   At the point when Spider-Man initially showed up in the mid 1960s, young people in superhero comic books were normally consigned to the part of sidekick to the hero. The Spider-Man arrangement got things started by highlighting Peter Parker, the secondary school understudy behind Spider-Man's mystery character and with whose ""self-fixations on dismissal, insufficiency, and forlornness"" youthful perusers could relate.[1] While Spider-Man had every one of the makings of a sidekick, not at all like past teenager saints, for example, Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero guide like Captain America and Batman; he along these lines needed to learn for himself that ""with incredible power there must likewise come awesome duty""‚Äî a line incorporated into a content box in the last board of the main Spider-Man story yet later retroactively credited to his gatekeeper, the late Uncle Ben.

Anyway, what I found interesting about this show was the following:  1. Creator/Writer/Director Joss Whedon 2.¬†The show was set in the year 2517 3. The two surviving powers are the United States and China whom fuse to form the central government, called the Alliance, resulting in the fusion of two cultures(source Wikipedia)  * I found #3 the most fascinating because in a¬†couple¬†of the inner city schools( lower income where I live)¬†they are teaching Chinese as an elective to middle school students in my county. Which leads me to think that number 3 is a definite possibility regarding the so called alliance between China and America.... Oh, and there are exchange programs for Chinese students to learn more about U.S History (middle school level) too.¬†#ThingsThatMakeYouThink",0,0,Emotional2000,I4tFNfROlqk,0.16688311688311688,2017-04-24 23:04:08,True,True

2017-05-07T04:12:37,"End Story:   ""The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like‚Ä¶ HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son-of-a-bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it‚Äôd be hard to NOT catch a fish‚Ä¶ even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄòParents Just Don‚Äôt Understand‚Äô. So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway.  Ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself, Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio; who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs going way out into the Gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady luck is returning!  On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big ass fish. He‚Äôs sure it‚Äôs a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can‚Äôt pull the monster in. Santiago‚Äôs leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he‚Äôs bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ‚Äúbrother‚Äù or maybe even, ‚Äúbro.‚Äù It‚Äôs sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding.  But on the third day, Santiago is freakin‚Äô EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a f*cking harpoon. It‚Äôs a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words - instead giving in to base desires - and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical.  Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin‚Äôs carcass, because we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you‚Äôve finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to f*cking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin.  Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he‚Äôs still unlucky. REALLY unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks ‚Äúdream killers‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt really all that fair. I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin‚Ä¶ Jesus, don‚Äôt even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding it‚Äôs own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it‚Äôs family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúdream killer‚Äù now, f*ckface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point.  Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said - he‚Äôs super tired. The next morning a group of fishermen gather around Santiago‚Äôs boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit-shingles! It‚Äôs over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man.  Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later, there‚Äôs a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.""",0,0,Juliana Toloza,I4tFNfROlqk,0.07771677927927928,2017-05-07 04:12:37,True,True

2017-05-19T17:31:53,"‚ÄúThe Old Man and the Sea‚Äù is the story of a fight between an elderly accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like‚Ä¶ HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son of a bitch on planet earth. Honestly if you were in a boat for eighty four days, it‚Äôd be hard NOT to catch a fish‚Ä¶ even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄúParents Just Don‚Äôt Understand.‚Äù  So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway, ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself. Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio, who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs going out into the Gulf Stream, WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady lucky is returning!  On the eighty fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big ass fish. He‚Äôs sure it‚Äôs a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can‚Äôt pull the monster in. Santiago‚Äôs leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he‚Äôs bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ‚Äúbrother‚Äù or maybe even, ‚Äúbro.‚Äù It‚Äôs sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding.  But on the third day, Santiago is freakin‚Äô EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a f‚Äîing harpoon. It‚Äôs a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words ‚Äî instead giving into base desires ‚Äî and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subect through unblinking violence. Typical. Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hit the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price.  But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin‚Äôs carcass, because as we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you‚Äôve finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to f‚Äîing shreds while dry humping your dignity with their crazy weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness.  Santiago realizes he‚Äôs still unlucky. Really unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks ‚Äúdream killers.‚Äù Which isn‚Äôt really all that fair, I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin‚Ä¶ Jesus, don‚Äôt even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding its own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for its family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúdream killer‚Äù now, f‚Äîface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said ‚Äî he‚Äôs super tired.  The next morning, a group of fishermen gather around Santiago‚Äôs boat. One measures the skeleton, and, holy shit shingles! It‚Äôs over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man. Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again.  Many years later, there‚Äôs a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.",0,0,Adoqhina,I4tFNfROlqk,0.07863906926406923,2017-05-19 17:31:53,True,True

2017-06-10T11:16:39,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like... HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son-of-a-bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it‚Äôd be hard to NOT catch a fish... even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄòParents Just Don‚Äôt Understand‚Äô. So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway. Ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself, Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio, who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs going way out into the Gulf Stream, WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady luck is returning! On the eight-fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines and by noon, he gets a bite from what feels like a big-ass fish. He‚Äôs sure it‚Äôs a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can‚Äôt pull the monster in. Santiago‚Äôs leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he‚Äôs bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this might adversary. He starts calling him ‚Äúbrother‚Äù or maybe even ‚Äúbro‚Äù. It‚Äôs sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding. But on the third day, Santiago is freakin‚Äô EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a fucking harpoon. It‚Äôs a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words ‚Äì instead giving in to his base desires ‚Äì and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical. Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin‚Äôs carcass, because as we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you‚Äôve finally found something good and true, sharks come a long and rip it all to fucking shreds while dry humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he‚Äôs still unlucky, REALLY unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks, ‚Äúdream killers‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt really all that fair. I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin... Jesus, don‚Äôt even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding its own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for its family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúdream killer‚Äù now, fuckface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He make it home and crashes, like I said, he‚Äôs super tired. The next morning, a group of fishermen gather around Santiago‚Äôs boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit shingles! It‚Äôs over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man. Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later, there‚Äôs a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.",0,0,cherry cherub !,I4tFNfROlqk,0.06476151315789475,2017-06-10 11:16:39,True,True

2017-06-26T01:34:05,"Someone already transcribed the scroll at the end: (3:28)  The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like‚Ä¶ HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son-of-a-bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it‚Äôd be hard to NOT catch a fish‚Ä¶ even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄòParents Just Don‚Äôt Understand‚Äô. So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway.  Ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself, Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio; who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs going way out into the Gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady luck is returning!  On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big ass fish. He‚Äôs sure it‚Äôs a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can‚Äôt pull the monster in. Santiago‚Äôs leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he‚Äôs bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ‚Äúbrother‚Äù or maybe even, ‚Äúbro.‚Äù It‚Äôs sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding.  But on the third day, Santiago is freakin‚Äô EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a f*cking harpoon. It‚Äôs a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words - instead giving in to base desires - and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical.  Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin‚Äôs carcass, because we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you‚Äôve finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to f*cking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin.  Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he‚Äôs still unlucky. REALLY unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks ‚Äúdream killers‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt really all that fair. I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin‚Ä¶ Jesus, don‚Äôt even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding it‚Äôs own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it‚Äôs family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúdream killer‚Äù now, f*ckface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point.  Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said - he‚Äôs super tired. The next morning a group of fishermen gather around Santiago‚Äôs boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit-shingles! It‚Äôs over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man.  Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later, there‚Äôs a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.

2018-08-18T20:08:23,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like‚Ä¶ HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty-four days without catching a fish because he‚Äôs the unluckiest son-of-a-bitch on planet earth. Honestly, if you were in a boat for eighty-four days, it‚Äôd be hard to NOT catch a fish‚Ä¶ even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say, ‚ÄòParents Just Don‚Äôt Understand‚Äô. So the boy visits Santiago‚Äôs shack anyway.  Ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself, Manolin helps out, moving Santiago‚Äôs fishing gear, making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio; who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he‚Äôs going way out into the Gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady luck is returning!  On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines, and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big ass fish. He‚Äôs sure it‚Äôs a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can‚Äôt pull the monster in. Santiago‚Äôs leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he‚Äôs bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him ‚Äúbrother‚Äù or maybe even, ‚Äúbro.‚Äù It‚Äôs sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding.  But on the third day, Santiago is freakin‚Äô EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a f*cking harpoon. It‚Äôs a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words - instead giving in to base desires - and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical.  Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin‚Äôs carcass, because we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you‚Äôve finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to f*cking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin.  Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he‚Äôs still unlucky. REALLY unlucky. (Duh!) He calls the sharks ‚Äúdream killers‚Äù. Which isn‚Äôt really all that fair. I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin‚Ä¶ Jesus, don‚Äôt even get me started on the marlin! It was just hanging out one day, minding it‚Äôs own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it‚Äôs family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúdream killer‚Äù now, f*ckface? The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point.  Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said - he‚Äôs super tired. The next morning a group of fishermen gather around Santiago‚Äôs boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit-shingles! It‚Äôs over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man.  Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again. Many years later, there‚Äôs a Red Lobster Restaurant in nearly every city in America, offering a casual dining experience and convenient parking.",0,0,Benton Marcum,I4tFNfROlqk,0.07771677927927928,2018-08-18 20:08:23,False,False
