The biggest complaint that gets levelled at him these days is him always acting behind 2 feet of make-up and ludicrous costumes, so he clearly has absolutely no problem covering up, in fact he prefers it. And Disney did not change the costume so we could see Depp's face as they wouldn't of had him so covered up as Tonto last year, or Alice in Wonderland or in ANY of the Pirates films. Disney is the biggest studio on the planet, it does not need Depp or any other actor to draw money, it does it on its own name alone and anything else is just a bonus. Wait and see the film, then give your opinions on Johnny Depp. You can criticise the costume, but you cant criticise Depp when you know full well he has no problem hiding his face and when you haven't even seen his performance.  ",0,0,Treefrog Johnson,2Byk9Is3TjY,-0.015909090909090914,2014-11-07 13:16:15,True,True

An example would be the upcoming Fantastic Four movie. The origins of the Fantastic Four are an all white cast. So, what do we do? We make the Human Torch black!

A lot would say that it is racist to take a beloved story focused mainly on black people and cast white people to portray them. Vice versa? Totally fine. Double standard, much? What I'm trying to get at as that we should be more concerned with the core plot of the movie, not the skin color of the people portraying them.

Don't get me wrong the movie looks great,  but tell me how a black witch,  or a charming Asian prince of just random coloured people wouldn't make it just that much better,  involving the whole world into this fantasy picture rather than just pleasing the imagination of the Western white world?  One of the greatest things of Harry Potter was that the cast was so diverse and I as a small kid always wanted to go to Hogwarts too because hey,  I saw every possible race in there,  it was somewhere I could have gone too. Even though the protagonists where white that doesn't matter because it's how Rowling invisioned it, we're not claiming to always put in random coloured people in major roles for racial diversity but why leave them out if there are indeed roles they could have portrayed.  Plus it would offer more roles for coloured actors to pursue because it's still an issue that coloured actors have a way harder time of being casted into various roles..

I will say ACT II of the ""Into the Woods"" musical is the true heart of it, but the movie in my opinion failed in this aspect. I won't spoil anything, but the movie bogged down and a lot of the scenes that brought the four main leads together felt forced. The characters swing moods to quickly and things happen abruptly.

Some parts of the movie do that except it doesn't show how it happened while they were singing. Thats why its called a movie where you show more than you tell. But overall, this movie ain't bad.

Here is my opinion: Everyone in this movie should win Oscars for singing and acting and all in all making this film one of the only good musical-movies, especially Meryl Streep. This is one of her greatest achievements, singing and acting-wise. And Emily Blunt too. Overall, the message of this movie is clear and true: Be careful what you wish for, because sometimes if you want something bad enough, you will do anything to get it, telling yourself that the end justifies the means, without giving one thought to the repercussions. Lilla Crawford was her usual sterling self, just as mind-blowing as she was in Annie, maybe even more.James Corden was pretty good. I LOVED the scene where Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen performed ""Agony"", where, instead of making it sad and depressing, they made it overly dramatic hilariously. Chris has got an impressive set of pipes. Anna Kendrick was VERY good at singing Cinderella, but she didn't really play the part of the damsel in distress. Nothing wrong with that, though. Johnny Depp was awesome. MacKenzie Mauzy was okay. She didn't act and/or sing that well, but maybe that's just because she was surrounded by people who were AMAZING. Daniel Huttlestone was good. Sang quite well, and not bad at acting. So all in all, I'd give this movie a 5 out of 5.",412,26,Krishna Shamanna,2Byk9Is3TjY,0.2425555555555556,2014-12-28 21:16:19,False,True

ITW requires close listening, for the songs/lyrics make up the dialogue and are interconnected.  i was surprised by how funny it is. laughed out loud a lot; sometimes i was the only one. there was constant laughing near my area, where most of the adults sat (range of 20s to middle age), and silence in front—kid zone—for those same scenes. that should give an idea of how one's understanding plays a part in enjoying ITW.  the plot ties together Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, and Rapunzel in an interesting way. while those are well-known as fairy tales, i like how ITW presents them in the form of a fable. tip: searching for/questioning that lesson while watching might hold your attention in the movie more.  for a character not emphasized early on, the Baker became my favorite. by the end he's the binding force in the other characters' lives, in an ironic Happily Ever After. i'd have liked his connection to Rapunzel, which viewers learn early on, revealed. in fact, Rapunzel basically disappears near the end so her storyline isn't concluded at all. minor gripes though.",0,0,lightyears2go,2Byk9Is3TjY,0.22812499999999997,2014-12-31 06:56:21,False,True

When the opening song finally ended after 5 minutes I was so happy. However the other 99% of the movie was also singing.

I understand it was to show a tragic ending but it just felt slightly unnecessary.

First, let me address fans of the Musical ""Into the Woods.""  I have no doubt that the musical itself is very enjoyable.  The dark themes and existential question it confronts are great and things I typically relish.  The common retort, I hear, is, ""what did you expect?...it's a 'dark' musical ""not meant for kids!""    Agreed!  But mind you, not everybody has had the cultural privileges of being acquainted with every musical, and this is no small group.  To this majority demographic, one must rely on the traditional avenues for judgement on the content of a film: 1) Trailer  2) Rating 3) The studio making the film.  In this case, we have a trailer that does not expose the adult nature of the film; we have rating of PG, and under the banner of Disney.  Furthermore, every preview of the film was targeted at children.  *spoiler alert*  So what about the film was so egregious in its inappropriateness to children?  How about the themes of sexual lust?  (Prince Charming seduces one of the main protagonists' wife, and she willingly obliged) Pedophilia?  (Johnny Depps 'Fox' character has ""White Van no windows"" undertones) Meaningless death? (many are killed for no apparent reason other than to say the world is cruel.)  Mind you, I am no prude, I can critically sit through  Gaspar Noé Irreversible and not even flinch.  But I would like to keep my children's innocence for at least some of their childhood, thank you very much, Disney.",0,0,Paul Chua,2Byk9Is3TjY,0.06616666666666665,2015-01-20 19:26:21,False,True

2016-08-21T06:24:47,"I just had a thought, do you think they'll make a TV movie remake of Into the Woods but have it be more similar to the original musical. Not that the movie strayed too much from the plot, but put some deleted songs back in abs keep the mysterious man and Rapunzel's daughter. This actually happened twice. Annie and Bye Bye Birdie had theatrical movies that strayed from the original shows then they were both remade for TV and those movies were more similar to the shows. There could be a commercial break after Ever After. I kind of would also like to see it as a live tv musical like Sound of Music and Grease and etc. I'd sort of like to see Jane Lynch as the witch or maybe even Kristen Chenoweth, but she's playing Velma NBC's Hairspray and no one (yet) has been in a live tv musical twice (though they could) I also thought of Audra McDonald but same problem she already did Sound of Music (if she did do it I can see her as the witch or Cinderella's mother)",0,0,h193013,2Byk9Is3TjY,0.17251082251082248,2016-08-21 06:24:47,False,False

Even though Red got eaten, and had to be saved, she appreciated her experiences, deviating from the path, and then started walking with a knife. Rapunzel snuck around, and learned that she could love someone more than she did her ""mother"", and that the way her mother showed her love, wasn't healthy. The boy was supposed to simply sell the cow for money, but he instead bought a magic bean story, that turned out to be true, and gave him enjoyment, for a while, before everything went to shit. The witch was in strict pursuit of good looks, but even after she got them, learning that she'd just lost her daughter's love, due to neglecting her happiness for all those years, was enough to make her go mad. Cinderella discovered love, but also betrayal, strength, and independence. The Baker's wife goes and acknowledges that she may desire someone other than her husband.

Sure, it takes a darker route and follows the original tales more faithfully (like having Cinderella's sisters chop off their legs so they may fit in the shoe) but the ending was just plain horrible. It basically closes with a relatively happy ending for a bunch of murderers. Jack is the one who steals both 5 golden coins and a golden egg from the giants in the sky, and the giants let him get away with it, and then he goes back up and also steals the golden harp, then the giant decides to act so Jack practically murders him. And not only that, then the giant's wife also gets down to Earth to claim justice for her husband's death and she gets murdered by Jack as well, with the assistance of Red Riding Hood and Cinderella.
