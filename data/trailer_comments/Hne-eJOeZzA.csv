It is said that Vlad impaled his entire court for co-operating with the Terks, and that was their punishment, along with any other traitor or Turk, it was rumored that the wine he drank upon the corpses of those who were impaled, was actually their blood, causing the roomers that he was a vampire. At birth, it is said all the angels in his father's castle, started to cry blood, which started the rumor that he was a demo, and is said that several priests tried to kill him, but were stopped, and when he became count, one of the last surviving priests tried to assassinate him. And from all the stories of how he was a mighty warrior, the best in all of (V)Wallachia. These are what caused Bram Stoker to base his novel off of the famous Vlad Dracul.

Unfortunately, it was crippled by not only a needlessly convoluted subplot that went nowhere, (in an effort to set up for a string of sequels) but also by a PG13 rating. If it had been rated R, and the producers had green lighted the amount of blood, gore, and violence that a TRUE vampire flick needs to shine, it would have been amazing.  That being said, I loved this movie. The casting was great, the acting was actually surprisingly good, the special effects were fucking gorgeous, and the music was absolutely beautiful. Not to mention, that the action beats that we DID get, were absolutely awesome.  A solid part of my love for this movie is probably my absolute obsession with Vampires.

2018-08-13T21:53:49,There is only one thing who knows everything only bec they have seen  everything and they remember more than they do. That is time. Before the exsintence of anything. I mean nature. It's only time which remembers everything and have seen everything and remember everthing more than anyone. But still I have doubt. I have doubt that why these are meeting time. I mean who is sending them in this hostel. Who is playing these songs and letting everthing known slowly and gradually. I mean I want to know that only and only time knows everything that even they don't remember anything not even shakti maa remember. In that case only time is there. Now question is why they are meeting time for this and who is sending them to this hostel . And trust me I am telling truth I have no knowledge about this why they are coming here and who is sending them. And trust me ibam telling you truth that I don't even know how I can help anyone in this regard. Since I have no exp in this. I have never done this before I really don't know how to help anyone in this regard since I have no working exp for this. And also I just few days back I came to know that I am reached to this level. I have no knowledge about this. I have not spoken to my guru also in this matter. What we can work on this. My both guru is invisible and I don't have any num also so that I can speak them on this matter. I really don't know about this. Do they have to go for any punishment for shaking and touching and messaging and for others do they have to go for any punishment as per garun puran says.  Or mahadev can directly give them moksha or any birth as a human.  I have no idea at all. One have to believe me . I have no idea regarding this. I need to consult my gurus but they are invisible for what I don't know. I can only comment on YouTube once I discuss this matter face to face to my gurus.  Since I have no working exp in this matter. But I really want to know why they are approaching time.
