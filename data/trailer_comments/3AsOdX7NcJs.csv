2020-03-30T18:45:41,"Might be part of the prophesy of Revelation chapter 16 and chapter 18 although it seems to me U.S. is partnered with London and supports Israel who is the Great Harlot but it doesn't look as if U.S. could turn against them.  London is by self admission claiming to be Babylon having Gog as head chieftain over Magog and Tubal of bible prophesy as identified in Ezekiel chapter 38:3-8 and 38:13-16.  The attack of Gog began in 1948 when by the Balfour Declaration Gog came upon Sheba and Dedan being descendants of Abraham and his wife Keturah (Gen. 25:1-3 and descendants of Moses and his Arabian wife Zipporah 1 Chronicles 26:24-26 also descendants of Moses brother-in-law Hobab who agreed reluctantly to lead the 12 tribes through the wilderness at Moses request Numbers 10:29-33.  As the Balfour declaration came from London, Babylon the Great could be and probably is London according to prophesy in Ezekiel chapters 26; 27; 28 see Ezekiel 28:2-10.    If this identification is correct London would identify as Tyre and Gog for they promote Tyre structures and worship as they did from the time of Solomon and Tyre.  This can be supported by Freemasonry ritual and Gog and Magog ritualistic procession of Gog and Magog statues which they carry through the streets of London every year.  These processions have been ongoing since before 1666 great fire of London when the first statues were destroyed.  The present statues were remade in 1671.  If this thesis is correct could it be that London could be attacked and defeated in fulfilment of prophesy as this film shows or will it be brought down by our Messiah accompanied by 10 kingdoms in battle WITH our Messiah?  Although at face value other ruling powers can also appear to fit into the prophesies to an extent, and all are or were in league with each other as allies it could be changing in this day. See Rev. 16:14; 16 for the dragon being Satanic influence, the Wild Beast being world domination and the false prophet have went forth to the kings of the entire inhabited earth to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty at Har Magedo (Israel).     Rev. 17:16-18 reads different in NKJ it reads 'The ten horns (meaning rulers) you saw ON the beast will hate the harlot.  In NWT it reads the ten horns that you saw AND the wild beast', hating the harlot gives a different prospective for verse 12 reads, '""the ten horns who receive authority as kings to rule with the wild beast would mean they cannot be the beast for they are with the beast.  This means according to NWT the 10 horns or rulers who have became rulers will fight with the Messiah and not against the Messiah for God will put it into their hearts to carry out his one thought so they gave their kingdom to the beast.  But will these 10 rulers turn against the harlot being Israel.  By my understanding Gog is an Israelite and is ruler over all of (Mystic) Babylon from London.  Could London's Gog hate the harlot (Israel) after having supported her or is Gog united with the Harlot as blood relation with her to the end?    Is the great harlot who sits upon many waters London being the ruler over the British Empire prophesy?  I know that the ruler Gog is an Israelite see 1 Chronicles 5:1, 4.  The great harlot is Israel because no voice of a bride or a bridegroom will ever be heard in her again Rev. 18:23.  This can only be Israel of which both London identify and those going onto the land of Israel claim to be by Gog's Balfour legislation.    Deep stuff!  Who can discern it?
