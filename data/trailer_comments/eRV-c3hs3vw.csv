2018-07-26T14:50:52,"I honestly think this movie is just a waste of time, money, and effort. You know what I would want to see in a Slender Man movie even though it's too late? A setting that starts out in a forest and goes nowhere else outside of it. Friends are camping and one of the friends leaves the others to answer the call of nature or something. The other friends realize that their friend is missing. They come across the location of where their friend went missing and find a page there, that lets them know they must collect more of them and that there is no way out of the forest. From there, Slender Man can begin terrorizing the campers on a journey to find their missing friend and escape the forest. But that's just what I think. Do you agree?

I mean for real, if those girls from the ""slender stabbing"" never actually committed attempted murder, and the movie was released when the pasta fandom wasn't dead, and was released, before the incident (or if it never happened) I gotta say, it would be a very successful movie. Well, wait no,that I take it back. This movie LEGIT looks like a freaking low budget student film. Even if it were to get good ratings, still I wouldn't change the fact that the trailer just looks terrible. And its PG-13!? WTF!? But hey, before I get bashed from you creppypasta fans, this is an OPINION meaning its only true in MY MIND. Well, its quite obvious that NOBODY WILL READ THIS. But still, it's my opinion.

2018-08-06T06:27:19,"My Problem with ""What"" this Movie is trying to sell me on is: Explaining the Slenderman Best Answer: Don't. Or At Least, Stop it with the ""Google Ex Machina"" ~A Movie about Slenderman Entering the Lives of Unsuspecting Victims: I'm All for That! A Movie where the ""Monster"" Slowly Breaks Apart the Attachments & Minds of his Victims for an Unknown, Unexplained result, Sounds Interesting to me.   Slenderman's Motive, as well as his type of Victim{Children, Teens, Adults, etc}, is Never a Consistent thing{Mainly Because Creppypasta is Written by Different Types of People with Different Ideas}; SO, Have FUN with that. A ""Horror Monster"" who's MO isn't revealed til the end, and/or Changes depending on Victim, is a Great Idea when considering the ability to tell Many Stories, and Thus Many Movies to make Money from. However, By explaining Him as this ""Demon you have to summon for him to Haunt you"" seems redundant & silly. If they where to make a sequel(s), What then? Have a different group of People ""summon"" him & have him do the Same thing? Then What's the Point? A Slenderman Movie, in my Option, Should NEVER be ABOUT the Slenderman; but rather, The Lives of the People he Enters, and the Result of doing so.  For Example: A Man, Celebrating his Promotion at Work by going for a Drive in his Car, Suddenly sees ""a Man"" in the Middle of the Road. He makes a hard Turn not to hit ""him"", only for him to Crash into a Tree. As the man looks back, there was no one was on the Road with him. As he goes about his Daily life, Now without his Main motive of transportation, He Starts to Notice someone ""Watching Him"" on the Bus. When he Looks back, no one is There. The Man starts to think he's going Crazy; He get Careless at work, Yelled at by his boss. He Starts to Lose Sleep, Paranoid of every Noise coming from his house. He Starts to Question if he ever actually Saw ""the Man"" on the Road. If there was actually someone ""Watching him"" on the Bus. He Relaxes. Gets a Good Night Sleep, and does so well, His Boss Praises his Work. All's fine, until he see ""That Man"" Across the Street. Standing there, head down. Not looking at anything but the Ground below him. A Tall man, bald, pale skin, wearing a Suit. The Man, Enraged, Walks towards the ""Man"" whom He now Knows he saw on the Road. The ""Man"" That Was ""Watching him"" on the Bus. The ""Man"" who was keeping him Awake at Night; he was Ready to confront him... When, at that exact moment: his new form of Transportation, the Bus, came to a Crashing stop, and the Man's world went dark. Waking up in a Hospital bed, he was now hooked up to a Life Support Device. Looking around, there was No one... Except ""The Man"". He Tried to Scream for help, but couldn't. The ""Man"" walked up to the Device; The ""Man"" who did nothing but Enter his life, Now decides what happens next...  No Need to Explain What Slenderman is; Just: What he can do; and the Result from it. The Literal Example of:        Show, Don't Tell!  I'm also Hating how ""Google"" always has an Answer to the Problem, in Modern Movies. I get it, In the Modern Age: that's the ""Go To"" Answer for Any Problem. ""Just Google it"". But, Here's an Idea: What if they do so, and Don't get Results; or, What if it's set in a Time when there is no Internet, what then? Being Powerless, or Having No Answer/Idea to the Threat that comes knocking on your door is a Classic way to Provoke a tension of Fear, without the Need of any Jump Scares. Many People Complain that Slenderman is ""Just a Guy, without a Face, coming to Get Ya""; and don't think that's Scary. Fine, perfectly acceptable. But what if you didn't know what he was. What if he Started out as some guy that Followed you Home, or was in your House without any possible way of doing so. What then? You Google it, but only fine Ransional Explainations. ""You Left a Window Unlocked"", ""he was Hiding in your Attic/Basement"". So you bolt the Windows & Doors. You make it so there's is no Way anyone could enter your home. Then, You Wake up to see the Slenderman in the Corner of your Room. You get up, and he's gone. You ""Google it"" again, you get stories, but nothing Concrete... No solution to ""Dealing with him""... What then? Exactly. ~Slenderman is the Perfect Kind of ""Horror Monster"" to HAVE FUN with. You don't need to Explain what he is, that takes away from the Fear. Just Put him in the Life of Any One Person, and go from there.   but, that's Just me. Other people probably have different opinions and ideas about the Slenderman...",0,0,dDeckon,eRV-c3hs3vw,0.10193921978404737,2018-08-06 06:27:19,False,True

I am hopeful but you could have simply focused on the friends looking for Katie that goes missing thinking she needs help psychologically, and as they do they learn about Slender Man who begins to stalk them as they realize that he is real. As the film goes on each one goes crazy like Slender drives his victums and one by one each goes missing becoming and it not only becomes a search for Katie but a fight for survival. Then by the end of the film all of them are missing, Slender Man wins.  Now i have a feeling all i described is going to go a roughly similar way but the difference here is no stupid video marks Slender Mans victims. Thats The Ring! Also as the trailer eludes to whoever watches the video is marked it takes away the mystery of how and why Slender Man takes them. You dont need to put or show a reason why he does it the fact you dont know why is what makes it more terrifying.  The three bell tolls is new but in all honesty its pointless. Why have it there? They accept his invitation? Doesn't that mean they are deliberately endangering their lives still? I guess i am going to have to find that out in the theater.  After all i said who knows the film could be good and Slender DOES look great. However i have the suspicion that its going to end up being the GAME (Arrival) had a better story than this.
