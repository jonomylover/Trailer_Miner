Now perhaps the San Andreas is close enough to produce a small Tsunami, but I'm fairly certain that we'd know about the potential tsunami of a San Andreas quake by now... after all there have been a few. (Of course, none of those are ever likely to be as large as the quakes that hit Fukushima, Japan or Christchurch, NZ). I doubt they could create anything bigger than maybe a few feet of rise... if that.  2.) A Tsunami does not appear as a 'breaking wave,' instead all the water in the are tends to suck out and then return as rising tide. Thus the other term for Tsunami - 'Tidal Wave.' Yes, the tide that comes in quickly swamps everything, and moves very far inland... but it is not a massive breaker wave.

2015-03-12T06:38:21,"San Andreas is a slip strike fault. It will not cause ground waves, and the shaking is in the wrong direction! It's east to west! San	Andreas is too far inland to cause tsunamis! The buildings will sink, not fall over! Ground liquefies! Okay, done ranting. We of the west coast have a more dangerous fault to think about, which San Andreas is an off shoot of. It is called the Cascadia subduction zone. What happened in Japan and in the Indian ocean is getting ready to happen here. It has already happened 13 times already, the last one on January 26, 1700, at around 9 pm. To see actual proof of Cascadia's power, go see the underwater forest on the tip of the peninsula of Washington state. 330 years ago, that forest was entirely above water. During the 1/26/1700 earthquake, the ground was yanked down nearly 30 feet. In some areas, most noticeable in Mukilteo, Washington, the ground was shoved up 30 feet. Cascadia tends to rupture anywhere between 300 to 980 years. A rupture on the San Andreas can and has triggered a rupture on Cascadia. Midwest, you guys aren't safe ether. You have the Madrid fault system, where a rupture in the early 1800s caused the Mississippi river to flow backwards for a few hours and created an island in the river. East Coast, you guys are not quake free ether. You have a fault system responsible for the Charleston earthquake. I know quakes. I have been studying them for a novel I'm planning.

Dadarrio was better in this than in a certain demigod movie which was so bad I shall not speak it's name, but I didn't exactly like that she (spoiler alert) died and resurrected. For gods sake, when you die, stay dead. The amount of times the main characters should have died but didn't just pisses me off even more. And the sound.

Such a quake will produce devastation to human civilization within about 50-100 miles of the SAF quake zone, especially in urban areas like Palm Springs, Los Angeles and San Francisco. No one knows when the Big One (""BO"") will happen because scientists cannot yet predict earthquakes with any precision. The 1906 San Francisco quake (mag ~7.8) and the 1857 Ft. Tejon quake (mag ~7.9) took place in northern and central California, respectively, and both were 'Big Ones'. Some scientists think the next BO will be in southern California. The SAF passes through LA's three main transportation, power, and utility corridors in southern California: I-10 in San Gorgonio (Banning) Pass, I-15 in Cajon Pass and I-5 in Tejon Pass. The San Francisco peninsula's water supply is contained in San Andreas Lake (!) and the Crystal Springs reservoirs, both squarely on the SAF.

I don't know if this movie could be any more clich√©e and predictable ^^ the movie starts off with a tragic scene to introduce us to the hero and nice guy of the movie: Dwayne Johnson and you know it will turn out good. Then the first earthquake happens and of course does the chinese guy die first. Then you get to know the whole family situation including the teenage girl who looks like a 30 years old with big boobs, the clich√©e extremely mean new boyfriend of his wife and the nostalgic family pictures. As soon as you see the buildings of the new boyfriend you will know they will go down in the earthquake. then later on the mean boyfriend of course 'deserves to die brutally' clich√©e then the father not wanting to experience the same cause of death of her daughter twice and not being able to save her. Then the ""she's dead but not really dead"" clich√©e and last but not least the '2012' ending with the view in the city and the 'what now?' phrase and the patriotic american flag to tell us everything will be fine again even tho the whole world and its people just crashed....

2018-04-08T08:32:54,"So I finally saw this. Having grown up in the 70's with the real disaster movies,   All i have to say is that it looks exactly like a bad TV movie with an 80 million dollar FX budget.  Why does Hollywood think that every character should look like they came from the Ford modeling agency? (Unrealistic characters that do not resemble LIFE)    I don't know what it is with these films but there is just something so fake about having the camera constantly swirl around the actors obviously shot in front of a green screen.   All of these films look the same.  The visual FX are ridiculously over done.  The destruction does not look realistic.  It looks silly.  It is so over the top it is not believable.  I feel sorry for the VFX artists who have to work on this junk.  Putting up with directors who have no clue what looks real and are just trying to pad their ""Reel"" while wearing baseball hats and sunglasses,... man",0,0,roquefortfiles,23VflsU3kZE,-0.12037037037037034,2018-04-08 08:32:54,False,False

Here's mountains, seas, all them come here to Significant oceans, deserts and canyons too.  Whispering and arguing about main theme California -- Earth said to its team.  San Andreas Fault is our main question: Tell me, oh my dear, what is your impression?  The earth tremors aroused in from all the indignation And all of the cities come for our recommendation  San Francisco is in fury, in a real ache, City personally experienced all the earthquake.  Fear of a large water - that's its biggest quality, For the life on the verge of a big calamity.  Los Angeles in trouble, San Diego is crying -- The Pacific Ocean can make them truly dying.   San Luis with friends asked for a minute of speech They have been joined Santa Maria and Avila Beach  In the entire planet because of that the strongest pant And it has name -- Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant.   What will happen with California, America and us If for NPPs will walk a sudden tsunami, as though fuss?  Break by the heart rests and barely audible moans Why nuclear power plant built in a seismic zone?  Why are our children-people thought like animals in a zoo? Can find some good decision? What are we have to do?   I know one powerful reason for the movement of the earth, Kids-faults loud quarrel barely having time to get birth.   Calaveras and Hayward are measured by force, Their time to rein in, so as not to make things worse.  In the face of distinguished audience, I solemnly swear, That I will deal with them with severity, but not without care.  I'm so afraid that the great waters will flood our lands So tired of disasters and when it finally will end!   I beg you, please inform all people the world That they fell silent just whereas I told.   Let him for a couple of days, and it is better for a week, To go out of the city, to avoid becoming weak.   In the first decade of August, I will try to deal with these problems, Everything happens again come full circle, I hope this.  Again we will be tasting Santa Rosa wine Everyone will be in Santa Clarita, your family and mine.   Discovery Science Center will be waiting in Santa Ana. And all of California will be beautiful.

Then, having survived that moment of utter idiocy, she gets her cell phone out and starts reading texts, still on the winding mountain road and in the face of oncoming traffic.
