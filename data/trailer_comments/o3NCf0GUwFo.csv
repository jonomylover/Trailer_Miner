King said it herself that Riggs was putting on a circus act, but it was personal when it came to Jack because he saw women as inferior. King couldn't allow Riggs' circus act to flourish because it would destroy her fight against Jack and equality for women.  Money is such a crucial part of this movie. It tempts, drives, and exposes the ill nature of the characters. The issue begins with the Prize money, and first reveals Jack's lack of respect towards women.
