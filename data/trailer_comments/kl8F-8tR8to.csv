The MI6 Kingsman organization seemed as it should.   A throwback to a bygone era perhaps.  But one which very well may be needed again today.   Jackson fit the eccentric,  environmentalist, super geek nut case. Which i never much trusted any of those types anyways.    Gazelle was clearly the best villain sidekick ever I think!!  She seemed to be the real brains behind the operation though.   In the backgroud but clearly in control. An interesting character of which i would like to know more of a backstory on.   Sofia Boutella i have known about for awhile now.  She is also in real life an extremly gifted dancer, and  performer. Who i didn't at first reconize until a friend pointed it out.

This movie has no shortness of suspense, more than enough action, sensible story, great plots, great scenes, and everything just actually makes sense. After watching the failures of earlier 2015 movies, I must say, in a long time, (probably since ""The Matrix"", or more recently ""Ironman 1"") this is the first movie I would actually give a 10 out of 10. I am so happy he didn't bag the recruited chick at the end, that would have just been cliche and ruin the ending. Being in the technology field, my senses and imagination ran wild this entire movie, even in ""downtime"", I could follow and relate to just about everything from gadgets to advanced weaponry. to sum it up in two words...

He also went to search for the Holy Grail, and as the meaning of Holy Grail is compared to something you search but cannot reach, the attampt to repay his debt to lancelot by pulling out the crystaline sword eggsy.
