It already looks ""typical"" of today's movies especially with the predictable same old formula movie trailer.  I already don't like the premise of Pete being a feral child in the woods.  Pete was never a feral child but an abused runaway.  Now perhaps he stayed in the woods 6 years only to be found again and sent back to some abusive foster home and have Eliot follow him and protect him along the way.  Then it might work.  Just going to have to wait and see i guess.  Having loved the original movie as a child I'm certainly going to go see it and give it a chance but my expectations are not very high for fear of being burned by hollywood again.  Also while not a musical this time around I hope the movie's music is at least half way decent.  It's been a long time now since I've heard a movie soundtrack that is truly moving in an unforgettable way.  Seems like most of the music in movies today is composed of nothing but random orchestral and subwoofer sounds.  I truly miss the days of John Williams, Alan Silvestri, Jerry Goldsmith, Bill Conti, etc.  And Heck I actually loved most of the music in the original Pete's Dragon.  Some of it was a little annoying and prolonged but the songs ""Brazzle Dazzle day"".  ""Swear I Saw a Dragon""  ""I love you too"", ""It's not easy"", and of course ""Candle on the Water"" were all excellent songs with very emotionally uplifting melodies.",0,0,Mr. Extreme,OlUkOid3TYc,0.11721121140763999,2016-02-22 04:20:07,True,True

We all appreciate your useless input on something you barely know. Unless you have a time machine and went to the future and saw the movie, your assumptions of it, are just that: assumptions.  And no, sweetie, it's not going to ruin a thing about what you saw before. The old story will still be there for you to see and enjoy. You think the new stuff is shit, okay, then don't pay to see it. Do you think someone will be forcing you to see the movie? Just what kind of people do you have around, honestly?  The thing is, you don't see the movie, then keep quiet about it, because deciding something is good or bad based on barely 1:20min of a one/two-hour-something movie it's just pure ignorance. You have no foundation to say if it's really good or not. Like I said, assumptions are not really a valid rate.  You don't like people remaking or changing old stories, then don't see it. Keep seeing the old movies you like and let other people enjoy something we might not have seen before. Not everyone likes the old movies, in case you have a hard time understanding that. And some of us can appreciate the old and the new. All you do saying stuff like that is painting yourself as a ignorant-childish drama queen. It's not really a good thing to be proud about.

Yes, there's nothing like the original but that's just what most of us grew up watching, if you believe the movie's 'not as good as the original' and has 'ruined your views on Pete's Dragon and all your hope in Disney' that's okay, it's your opinion! But don't complain about a movie when all you've seen is a short trailer, I grew up watching Pete's Dragon on VHS and yes I love the original, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to watch the 'live action' version and complain about it all over YouTube :)",0,0,Georgia Bishop,OlUkOid3TYc,0.25822510822510825,2016-02-23 17:11:24,True,True

2016-02-26T00:54:40,"Okay, kids, ladies, gentlemen, lentlemen, whatever you identify by. I've learned something when it comes to remakes by watching Rob Zombie's Halloween. I'm sure you've seen it too, and like you, once upon a time, I compared the two movies side by side and the first ten minutes of the movie, I was lamenting on how different this movie was from John Carpenter's version. When I finally set aside my prejudices and was able to let go of the version that John Carpenter made, I enjoyed the movie. Michael Myers is my favorite horror villain and in the JC version there was hardly an explanation for why he snapped and Rob Zombie revealed that mystery for us.  I learned that neither of the movies take away from either version. So! If you love the classic Pete's Dragon, watch it. Watch it, watch it, watch it. Enjoy it for what it is. A movie that was just getting into the baby steps of CGI and the amount of work that went into making it convincing that a dragon was following Pete around town causing all kinds of havoc.   This new movie has my attention. Its intriguing to me because it's set in present day, same as the original movie was. Remakes may make people lament concerning their childhood vision being ripped to pieces, but keep in mind that those who are seem to be 20 and 30 somethings who don't realize that these movies are supposed to be for your kids. Show the originals to your kids, let them watch both movies, but don't for one second, be a shitty adult in the life of any child who may have the misfortune of having to be around you for five minutes and crush a movie you haven't seen under your foot and kill any sort of hope they have of being able to do their own creative take someday on a movie they want to see remade when technology advances beyond what we're capable of now and possibly breaking molds.   If you want to hate the movie, hate it, but don't teach your kids to hate a movie just because you've lost a sense of appreciation and respect for new grounds being tilled.  That is all. Reply as you will, I look forward to the sour grapes, because the kids in my life will make it into a fine wine because i'm not here to tell them their ""remake"" movies suck.",1,0,Rebecca Zachary,OlUkOid3TYc,0.14140840220385673,2016-02-26 00:54:40,True,True

Especially if you take out the music, comedic, and lighthearted aspects of the original. Elliot is supposed to be loving and goofy, and then there's Nora, the strong, independent, and motherly influence on Pete. And don't forget her father, whose crazy in all of the right ways to make him such an enjoyable character. And finally, Pete's adoptive family of swamp trash hicks that we all love to hate.

(I know it's probably not this fault alone but still...)  And welcome back to YOUR REMAKE IS FAILED !  This time we have a all time champion since it's the exact same studio who make the two version and let get it b*** r***** ! Thanks Disney glad to see you don't care about your classic anymore unless they are animated !   Before going to our main topic lets have a look back at the original movie ! Pete is a young boy who ran away of his adoptive family who were abusive. He is protected by a friendly looking doofus dragon : Elliott. He arrives in a fisher town with an impossible name. He start to fit in with some difficulties and when Lampie and his daughter Nora say he can stay a greedy pharmacian and his abusive family teams up to separate Pete and Elliott. After dealing with them Nora fianc√© Paul who where supposedly dead come back and Pete has a happy loving family. The movie was bright, colorfull and funny. Unless when things goes sour and then the ambiance is darker, there is a tempest and all. The movie mixed animation and Live action. A classic in Disney old movies.  Now lets have a look of the remakes trailer. So heres Pete is not a runnaway orphan, is a wild child. He is discovered by a family of three who adopts him and the perfect mom is understanding and loving bla bla bla... They discovered that he was protected by a giant ""impressive"" looking dragon. Somehow the army heards of that and it's the witch hunt all over again despite the best effort of Perfect Mama and the attachement of Pete.  A french youtube channel, Le fossoyeur de film (The movie's undertaker), has made a video about good and bad remakes. If you understand french, go see it. In those video Le fossoyeur de film says there is two categories of remakes. The ones who stick to the original and the one who tries to take liberties with it. Here at the first glance we would says they try to take liberties, since it has little but nothing to do with the original ones. I beg to differ, they do stick to the story, it's just the wrong ones ! Because for me it's not just a bad remake of Pete's Dragon, it's a bad remake of the Iron giant with some Free Willy elements. And Jungle Books too. So great job it's not just ONE bad remakes, it's THREE bad remakes ! Yeah my soul is dying !   So what is wrong so far. First of all Pete. Why is he a wild child all of sudden? Didn't Disney just release a Jungle Book remake? Seriously guys? Wasn't a abused orphan who try to escape a cruel system good enough for you? You actually thinks we like a child whith no identity to a poor orphan or is it how you saw those kids who run away? The the family, with a cute little girl so the ones in the publics and the feminist (or rather sexist) won't rant about it, does she really gonna brings anything to the story? The mom is so understanding that she is actually more iresponsible than a good mother. Pete's place is in an hospital, because someone who lived in the forest, let alone a child is likely to have health issue and I don't care about what kind of a great person you are but no one in their right mind will bring two children near a dragon and the army. So your place is in a mental ward madam. The husband is so transparent that even Paul who was there for less than 10 minutes in the original movie is more interesting. So we have a clich√© american family so nice and perfect comparing to the rest of the world we seen that I might barf. So it's pretty obvious it's lazy writing. No effort has been put into it. They didn't try to write likable charactere and find clich√© and excuses to avoid it.   Another thing I wants to point out is the ambiance. Why is it so dark? Seriously the ambiance in the original was as much a part of the story telling than the songs and the dialogues. You can't keep the same lowlight and restricted palets for the entire movie !   Is that supposed to be epic because to me it's dull and annoying and one of the biggest thing that said it's not worth watching it.  Oh and it's not worth going to the same studio as Peter Jackson for your special effects if it's for the dragon to look so fake. The only things you had for yourself was a occasion to have better special effect  than the original and you blew it. It looks fake, unfriendly and the movie wanted so much to be a blockbuster that they forgot the dragon was supposed to be able to take care of Pete, but that thing seems so big and wild I dont think he could help anyone because as I wrote before, Pete is a dragon version of Mary Poppins and the care bears, it's purpose is to help children. That thing can't help children.   So to sums it up, the movie is not remaking the right movie, the charactere writings is lazy, full of inconsistence and clich√© and where for his time the special effect of the original was memorable and impressive this one has no substance, is jsut for show and dissapointing. Disney, please next time hired Michael Bay, if you really have to make a lazy blockbuster remake, at least he will make something watchable and respect the concept better. For all the bad he has done or we thinks of him at least he has respected the franchise he adapted. Transformers was indeed about space robot on earth disguised as cars and Ninja Turtles about mutated ninja turtles fighting crime. That is Not Pete's Dragon. And if killing a movie was possible, that remake should be charged as murder.",1,2,C√©line BIED,OlUkOid3TYc,0.12101564110492682,2016-07-30 20:46:30,True,True

2016-08-27T18:40:23,"To all naysayers & armchair critics... When I first saw the teaser several months ago, I had a feeling and I was not wrong. Best movie of the summer...best of 2016! And nobody knows it...! This movie has heart, soul, hope all rolled into a great story. It's not a remake but more a re-imagining of a tale that is what Disney does best but hasn't done in a long time. Critics were wrong about ""Suicide Squad"" but were so very right about ""Pete's Dragon"". I'm a man of 63 years. I grew up in Disneyland and the lore of Disney imagination. I have seen this film three times because it makes me feel GOOD, it makes me feel young.  If you told me a CGI dragon's love for a young boy would make me weep, I'd tell you that you were nuts.

Dragons are reptiles and reptiles are supposed to be scaly-skinned. The only hair that Elliott should have is on the top of his head and the tip of his tail.
