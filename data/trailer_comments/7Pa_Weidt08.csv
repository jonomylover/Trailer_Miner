And then Shrek came along and every other movie had to follow in its footsteps!!!  Why?!!?  Are people just that worried that children will get bored out of their mind with something that's sweet and gentle without bombarding them without pop cultural references or dated dance numbers?  Is this why movies like The BFG and Kubo didn't perform well at the box office?!!? I apologize if I'm going on a rant here.  But I just hate the fact that something I hold very near and dear to my heart is getting this kind of treatment.

I'll get the least concern out of the way: The way MacGregor is portrayed here, is a tragic waste of Domhnall Gleeson's immense talent. He's been in a few stinkers over the last handful of years (the films were stinkers, not his performance), and this is no way to improve upon it. He didn't really convince me that MacGregor was all too frightened of the pig, even for all of that screeching he did.  He's usually a much better actor than this, and I'm sad he's been so cheapened.  Next: Peter Rabbit as a whole is supposed to be simplistic, gentle, charming, and quiet.  WHAT. IS. THIS?!  To start, the music is all... gangster'd out and loud, and reminds me of Sing! and the Peanuts Movie trailer and the end of Magic Mike XXL.  They did this to Alvin & the Chipmunks and Paddington as well, but at least with Alvin it sort of worked because they were hip and 2 cool 4 school to begin with.  This complete ""crassification"" of such a pure and gentle atmosphere as Peter Rabbit is known for... shudder!  And the biggest: I'm completely NOT cool with Peter's ""make it rain"" thuggish attitude!!  It's great if some of you think it's funny or an improvement, but I maintain that that is NOT MY PETER RABBIT.  MY Peter is cute and delicate and curious, not rude and loud and a party boy.  I'm so terribly sad at how many reboots have fallen victim to this... complete bastardization and stripping of integrity.  The Powerpuff Girls twerking, the Ghostbust-ette's with their frenetic SNL-style gross-out humor that fell flat, the aforementioned Paddington and Alvin being butchered... I'm sure there are so many others... But MY GOODNESS, can't anything that came before the ""cool"" era just be left on its own and be ""reintroduced"" to today's younger generation without destroying the HEART of the thing?  It is a total affront to Beatrix Potter's ART and VISION that this thing even exists the way it does.

It breaks my heart to tell you the truth.   It's pretty disgusting and terribly disrespectful towards the author and her beautiful literary works.  I grew up with Beatrix Potter books.  I still have some.  And I have enjoyed reading the tales to my grandson.   I even don't mind the  animated movies by Nickelodeon.  They are quite nicely done.    I wouldn't be surprised that cinemas in England will boycott this crappy movie.   I just don't  think  They are going to take too kindly towards it.   Everyone over there  knows who Peter Rabbit and Beatrix Potter is.  And they aren't going to like this rubbish.  I am British myself and live in the States and I just gave that feeling it won't go down too well with the British audience.  My second response is towards the thumbs down and majority of the comments made here.  I am encouraged and so  relieved to see all the responses and how so many of us here are unified in our thoughts and feelings towards this travesty of a movie.

2018-10-16T06:29:09,"I saw the movie recently, and here are my thoughts.  When I was a kid, one of my fondest childhood memories was reading Beatrix Potter‚Äôs stories. I loved Beatrix‚Äôs stories! Not just her lovely writing, but also her gorgeous artwork! So yeah, the work of Beatrix Potter is very special to me. So I took this adaptation very personally...   In case you don‚Äôt know, in this movie Peter Rabbit is a mischievous critter who likes to steal food from old McGregor‚Äôs house, under the belief that these are his plants because McGregor built over a spot where rabbits used to live. One day though, McGregor ends up having a heart attack, so Peter and the local wildlife take over the old man‚Äôs home in celebration. Thomas is a hard-work perfectionist but when some idiot related to the higher-ups gets his promotion, he has a public meltdown and is fired. However, when Thomas finds out that his great uncle McGregor has died and left behind a mansion for him, he decides to refurbish it and sell it off so that he can start his own shop to compete with his ex-employees‚Äô business. When Thomas arrives at his great uncle‚Äôs mansion, his neighbour Bea insists that he let the wildlife go freely around his home. Thomas reluctantly complies but only because he fancies her, secretly defending his home behind her back because he knows that he needs to protect his property. Peter Rabbit, his triplets sisters and his cousin Benjamin Bunny see that they have a new neighbour, one that is getting closer to their friend Bea. They decide to attack Thomas‚Äôs home in hopes of defeating him, and taking back what they believe is theirs.   This movie is not faithful to the work of Beatrix Potter AT ALL. While Potter‚Äôs Peter Rabbit was a wholesome and nuanced tale of disciplinary values, teaching kids to behave and keep safe, this movie is far more anarchic, over the top and cartoony, resembling the movie Hop more than anything related to Beatrix Potter! It‚Äôs like the filmmakers weren‚Äôt confident that children have the patience and intelligence to enjoy Potter‚Äôs subtle storytelling, so they gave Peter a makeover to make him more hip, modern and irreverent. Which is bound to offend purist fans of the author‚Äôs books! So, okay these filmmakers want to present their OWN version of Peter Rabbit, one for today‚Äôs generation.   However, I‚Äôm only accepting of this if the alterations and updates are actually GOOD. Changes that work in the long run! Unfortunately, this film is not a good example of repackaging a beloved piece of children‚Äôs literature to 2010s kids. This film‚Äôs version of Peter Rabbit isn‚Äôt even an attempt at an original story. The movie follows the template of animals defending their home; a narrative that has been done to death SO many countless times, that the list could fill a 500-page book by now! The rabbits aren‚Äôt defending their woodland forest from destructive humans, but rather invading the house of a man who legally owns this land now! Yes, rabbits used to live in this spot, but Thomas is simply inherenting what‚Äôs legally HIS. Yes, the rabbits don‚Äôt understand human property laws, but they know full well that Thomas wasn‚Äôt the one who built over their spot, so they have no right to make it also personal!   Bea tells Thomas that he has to share his home with the wildlife. Excuse me, but this is HIS house! You can‚Äôt guilt your neighbour into letting animals roam riot in a place they rightfully own! You are totally welcome to let rabbits go into your house, but it‚Äôs rude and inconsiderate to look down on anyone who doesn‚Äôt do the same! I don‚Äôt even feel sorry for these animals, they‚Äôre all very annoying! I‚Äôm a vegetarian, and I wouldn‚Äôt blame Thomas for turning these little buggers into pies! They‚Äôre always trying way too hard to make us laugh; bouncing around like they‚Äôre high on sugar, and their methods of antagonising Thomas can be downright mean-spirited! These aren‚Äôt silly pranks; they‚Äôre acts of deviant cruelty. Clamping animal traps on his body, wiring his house to electrocute him, and abusing his sensitive blueberry allergy; a sequence that was strongly criticised as it tapped into allergy sufferers worst nightmares for comical effect, and presented allergy bullying as acceptably funny! Allergy bullying is a real problem, it has to be discouraged! And a children‚Äôs film shouldn‚Äôt be normalising it or telling kids that it‚Äôs okay to laugh at. This movie has a responsibility to its impressionable young audience. Although, kudos to the filmmakers for apologising for the scene. That‚Äôs very mature of them!   The film does address the ethics of the rabbit‚Äôs invasion, but it takes Peter to forever to admit that he‚Äôs basically being a bully. He antagonises Thomas for so long, that it‚Äôs hard to believe that he has a conscience deep down. So when he does finally feel sorry for his victim, it‚Äôs all too late and I don‚Äôt buy that he genuinely feels bad. He‚Äôs only developing guilt at this point because the plot calls for it! It‚Äôs like the mentality of the script was ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve run out of ways to humiliate Thomas. Let‚Äôs just give Peter a heart now.‚Äô   The film can also be insultingly patronising at times too; it doesn‚Äôt trust its audience to be smart enough to understand the characters‚Äô psychology, so they have the rabbits themselves spell things out, like we are too dumb to realise that Peter has mummy issues, or that Benjamin is easily led into situations. It tries to frame these on the nose character developments as meta humour, but that‚Äôs not a consistent humour style that the film is going for. The movie usually tends to only break the 4th wall when it wants to over-explain something to the audience; out of fear that we can‚Äôt read into the characters ourselves.   Many of this film‚Äôs problems would be easily forgiven if the comedy was actually funny! But every joke falls flatter than a pancake, and each gag is repeated again and again! It‚Äôs so overbearing watching a film tell the same 5 jokes at nauseam! I can imagine all the silly slapstick making very young children laugh, but not because the film‚Äôs humour is clever or good. It‚Äôs just very easy to make kids this age laugh at these kinds of things.   The only saving grace for the movie, to me is the cute romance between Thomas and Bea. While I have mixed feelings about them both as characters, their scenes together display sone believable chemistry, and they make for a rather charming couple! The romance isn‚Äôt a powerful love story or anything, but it‚Äôs still kind of sweet, and their scenes together were the only parts of the film that I could tolerate.",0,0,Unicorn Bunny,7Pa_Weidt08,0.11851047063137228,2018-10-16 06:29:09,False,False

The original Peter Rabbit was designed to give whimsical and soft stories to children at a time when those types of stories were popular, but here in the 2010s those types of stories don‚Äôt do quite as well with younger audiences, so this version of Peter Rabbit has made a shift to comedy, since that‚Äôs what kids like now.

Peter Rabbit In this film is so hard to watch, that was not his character. Yes, he liked mischief but the stuff he said in the film would never of actually had come out of his mouth. Also, Cottontail, Flospy and Mopsy would of never gone into the garden their whole lifetime. The animation is actually alright, but the way the characters act and how Peter Rabbit and the others personality are bought out is horrific. If you have the read books, you know that the rabbits are quite proper and posh spoke, in this film they sound like chavs down from Chatham. A couple of scenes were okay, don‚Äôt get me wrong but 98% of it was horrible and really, really hard to watch. Some scenes they show Beatrix Potter‚Äôs drawings coming to life and I would of loved the film if it was like that, and was nice and sweet and like the books. It didn‚Äôt need to be the creation of the books, it could of been a slightly different story don‚Äôt get me wrong but it‚Äôs the personalities, the songs and the they speak/act that really turned me off. As I have the read the books and Peter Rabbit part of my life, this is very disappointing for me.

2019-05-03T04:20:45,"I'm seeing a lot of people comment ""You can't complain too much about these films, they're for kids"", I have to counter argue this defence with these points:   1) The term ""It's a kids' movie"" can defend why a film isn't too violent or why it has a colourful art style, but it shouldn't be used to explain why a film is bad, children's films aren't immune from criticism and ""It's a Kids' movie"" isn't a license for a film to be lazy or uncreative.   2) The Default acceptable standard for children's movies shouldn't be ""Whatever, it'll do, it's for kids"", especially when there's so many children's movies out there that are both emotionally challenging and imaginative, from ""Toy Story"" to ""The Secret of NIMH"", ""Matilda"" to ""The Neverending Story"", there's no excuses for children's films to get away with being insultingly low standard or unambitious.    3) Children aren't the only audience who watch these films, don't forget that parents have to see them too, why should it be a chore or punishment for them? Give them an experience that they can appreciate with their kids, a bonding opportunity that they can sincerely share.   Great children's movies respect their young audience, they don't underestimate what kids can take in as an audience, they believe that kids are smarter than we think and try to teach them to understand storytelling values, they are so well written & produced that they can be treasured for a lifetime. Let's not shrug our shoulders or turn the other cheek when a film for kids is bad, we need to call them out on their low standards or easy pandering, because the next generation deserve movies that treat them with respect and don't just see them as a money making opportunity, thank you.",0,2,Unicorn Bunny,7Pa_Weidt08,0.03134920634920637,2019-05-03 04:20:45,False,False
