However, ""I look like I belong in a children's film but I'm really crude and R-rated"" is only funny the first 2 times and is not enough to make an entire film around (just look at Ted, a movie that's just ""look, I'm a teddy bear that drinks and swears""), but it can be cleaver if the story actually utilizes the fact that they're not humans for more than just sight gags (like in Ted 2, where Ted and society has to figure out if Ted is human or property).",22,5,catholiccontriversy,-eks8LG72uo,0.06208333333333334,2018-05-28 01:26:06,True,True

Seriously, I would like to say that, if Jim Hensen actually saw this, I bet that he would actually like it, but only to a certain extent. I mean, looking back at early projects he did, it could be inferred that he actually enjoyed this sort of humor. If he didn't, he wouldn't have made extremely violent commercials for Wilkins Coffee back in the day. Also, even though this movie seems to be pretty raunchy, there are some saving graces for it, as can be seen in the trailer. One of them being the way that the puppets are being controlled. For example, the way they walked across the street in the beginning of the trailer. You can actually see them walking! How did they do that? How did they not use CGI for that? Also, Melissa McCarthy is in it too, and she's freaking awesome! And another saving grace for this is that no matter how hard they try, this will never be on the same level of disturbance as the infamous ""Dark Crystal"". Because that movie is even more creepy than this! And this is supposed to be a parody. It's not supposed to be taken seriously. Chill out, people.
