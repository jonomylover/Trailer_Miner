2015-06-24T06:58:28,"I feel so honored to be the first comment. All of my hard work and dedication has paid off. Getting the first comment has been a dream of mine for many years, and I would like to thank those who have helped me along the way. First and foremost i would like to thank god for giving me this opportunity. Next i would like to thank my parents. I want to thank my friend Peter Griffin for being really skinny and always there for me. I would also like to thank my pet tadpole for surviving against all odds for over a week. Next i would like to thank the squirrel that lives in my backyard for climbing trees because that gives me inspiration that i need to get through the day. This is a special moment in my life and i would like to thank any of my unmentioned friends and family that have helped me along the way. This moment will be a moment that I will never forget. I just remembered a few other people i would like to thank; Abraham Lincoln, the fish I caught in the third grade, my light in my room because i wouldn’t be able to see the keyboard without it, the internet for letting me go on the bodybuilding forums, my house because without it i would be homeless, and last but not least i would like to thank all the people out there that actually took time out of their day to read this. I cannot stress how much of a big deal to me this is. I have been trying to be the first on a post for years, but that has not been possible until this amazing day. Hopefully my good luck will continue, but this is undoubtedly a rare occasion. If you asked me how I did this, I would say, you can achieve anything u set your mind on. To all the kids out there reading this, I would like to tell them to follow their dreams. Being the first is truly amazing, thank you everyone",7,3,Bill C.I.A.

2015-07-10T01:55:51,"This almost seems like the plot from the original trailer of the 3rd movie. There was a priest getting attacked on a table. I even think in the 3rd movie a lot of this was supposed to be in it. But they ended up changing the whole story around so they could make more. After the first 3 when the 4th came out everyone hated the series. Tbh the 1 movie was only supposed to be the end. There was 3 endings in the 1st movie. Where Katie kills herself & the other one where the police come & shoot her. They only have done these movies for movie. If the 3rd movie had stuck to the original script it would have been over with most likely. I hope this movie explains, why is hunter is so important. Who that random roby kid was, & was was he stollen also. Is Katie going to get unpossessed? Is the daughter from the 2nd movie going to be in this & get hunter back? Is the Jessie going to be in the cult in this movie. There's a lot unanswered. I mean how are there going to fit all this in one movie. I know they said there was originally going to be a few more movies of this series, but I mean people don't want these movies anymore, so I bet they lost there contract & had to put every last thing into this movie to end it all for good. I mean what more could they do though. They had the couple with just one camera. Then the family with a new baby & cameras everywhere. Then Katie & Kristi's past (3 cameras but vintage style). Then a family with technology filming them at all times). Then the poor ghetto 1 camera spin off movie. Which had a lot of information needed to understand the movies. Now a family in a new house, (3rd movie had a new house also) found weird tapes, & has a magic camera that makes there daughter possessed. I mean it looks like a great movie, but really?!?! How does any of this have to do with haunter? The movie series has made it about him ever since the 2nd movie. Now this little girl is next? Idk but I hope everything is answered in this.

But I kinda forgave that movie because there were still some chill-worthy scenes, and I hoped the creators could still turn it around and make the next one better.

It looks like it's going to be less about the paranormal occurrences and the fearful  occupants and more about that toby and his dimension.

And this being the 6th movie, I thought they would learn what to do and what not to do. So I had high expectations for this movie. And... it was the worst in the franchise. Seriously. Even the trashy Paranormal Activity 4 was better than this. This movie was everything wrong from all the Paranormal Activity movies squeezed into one movie. Stupid characters (characters who do stupid things that no one would do in real life), tons of cheap and false jumpscares, no suspense, only tension that builds up to a jumpscare and nothing more, horrible ending, so many cliches, predictable structure, etc etc etc....And when the characters tried to figure out the reason for things (why things are like they are), it felt like they were just saying a summary of the story to us viewers instead of actually discussing it with each other. Like alway, there's only one alive in the end which records the final minutes, which sees some kind of secret important stuff before that character dies as well.   The ONLY thing I liked about this movie was the fact that the Paranormal Activity 3 tapes were found, which added more to the ""found footage"" feel to the 3rd movie. Other than that, the movie was just scene after scene of cheap jumpscares, stupid characters, cliches, and nothing good. It's funny how movies in a franchise can vary so much.

And the fun thing is, the creators of the movie clearly wanted to make Toby appear as scary and 'evil', and the humans as 'good' and 'pure'. But it actually worked the wrong way for me; I got this strong feeling of Toby being a good entity that does an amazing job in raising Leila and protecting her, while all the human roles in Leila's life were just super annoying and stupid as fuck. Really bad movie. I'm not religious in any way, but this movie definitely confirmed for me that if I had to choose between christianity and satanism, I'd go with satanism in a heartbeat.
