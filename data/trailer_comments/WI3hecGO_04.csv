I think you should watch a superhero movie for fun and not because you want the ""heroes"" to morally question their actions and other deep stuff. Thats a huge issue I think DC has. Kids have always been looking up to superheroes and I think the filmmakers were too when they were kids. But now as they have grown older they want to make a more ""grown up"" movie so the older generation still can enjoy it. But what about the kids now? They are going to get confused by these movies and forget them faster than you can say Infinity War. Superman and Batman are in my opinion THE best superheroes and all is waisted in a big dark Universe where they are both cold-blooded killers.

But Leto WILL be phenomenal in it, as will Robbie and Davis at the very least. Everyone needs to just relax. It was the same shit when Ledger was first cast, everyone was enraged.

2015-07-14T17:26:48,"A lot of people directed me to this trailer when I said that ""Jared Leto's joker looks terrible"". So I'm just going to leave my thoughts: (Note, I will only be giving my opinion on the characters I care about, so to those random readers who actually read this, I didn't forget characters, I just have less care for them).¬†  Well, here I am, now seeing this trailer... And I must say, my opinion on this Joker has stayed the same. If anything it improved a very tiny bit, but I still cannot view this as a good Joker yet. To huge Joker fans, and after Heath Ledger's amazing performance, Jared Leto has a lot to go up against, and so far he isn't impressing me. Lets also not forget to throw in the recent performances of Mark Hamill as the Joker in the Arkham games. Jared Leto is failing to impress me, and I found the TV show's (Gotham) Joker to be much better (Cameron Monaghan). I am looking forward to seeing more of Cameron, than of Jared. My faith in this movie role of the Joker is still on edge, but I will try to not cast it aside until I am sitting in the movie theater and reacting with other fans.¬†  This Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is sexy as hell. But I actually find myself asking if this sexy is too much for the character. While I do like to see the sexy side of Harley Quinn, I'd really like to see them not turn her into eye candy and nothing more. However, from this trailer I really like the look Margot Robbie gives to Harley Quinn. The outfit looks amazing, the attitude seems crazy enough, and I am looking forward to seeing the character in action. While I have my worries, I also feel this could be an amazing Harley Quinn Performance.¬†  As a huge fan of Will Smith, I have nothing negative to say here. I feel he'll make a good Deadshot. Though I do have to question if Will Smith's voice fits the scene, I don't know, Will Smith has always had a better voice when playing a hero.¬†  Killer Croc looks great. Last I heard it was all make-up, and not CGI. So I have to note that, because if that is the case the make-up crew out did themselves.¬†  As for the over all plot (which I know from the comics), I was already hyped for this. I am looking forward to the plot, and seeing the villains take the reigns as the forefront in the DC movies.

Leto's has the bleached skin, bright green hair, red lips, and looks and sounds scary. Ledger was more of a goofy anarchist, where as Leto is a straight forward psychopathic nutcase.   As for the tattoos and teeth, they make sense, and are clearly to emphasize that he's been in business for a while. Batman knocked his teeth out, and the tattoos are due to his time in prison, doing what joker does and decorating himself. Not just clothes, but ink.  The forehead tat is so great, because if someone got that in real life they would be referring to emotional damage. He's physically damaged. Dunked in a chemical bath, beaten, and scarred.

They have her dark/crazy/sexy side down but I just hope they get her smart sense of humour too. killer Croc and enchantress look great and obvious choice for Waller no doubt. Unsure about smith being Deadshot. He's a great actor so he may surprise us being a bad-ass and hopefully they capture Boomerang/Deadshot banter. Joker Emm still on the fence with that one not sure at all, I cant really make a judgement only seeing 10 seconds or so. The voice sounds creepy but the laugh isn't as manic as id of liked. I get there kinda going for the suave fresh faced look of the joker in the 'dark knight returns' but give me 'The killing joke' or BMTAS type of joker any day of the week. Just my opinion.

I bet if any other actor was playing the character, he would be wearing the mask most of the time. but it's Will Smith, so we have to see his face most of the time right? what are they gonna do? make a movie where he's actually playing a different type of character, one who usually wears a mask? what are you nuts? plus in the trailer he gets more lines than almost every other member of the team, most of them don't even get dialog.

If we're gonna be real about it, the worst Joker ever was Jack Nicholson. And I'm not saying that because he was bad, by any means. He was just the worst. The Joker is a hard character to portray, and each actor that's been in those shoes has played him differently. Personally, I like the up-to-date maniacal take he seems to be letting through. That laugh is eerily reminiscent of Mark Hamill, in a way. And regarding his scene in this trailer: the torturing: very Heath Ledger-esque.

Really his Joker was a surprisingly political anarchist type villain. He would play games of chance like ""who will you save? Harvey or Rachel?"" Which boat will blow up?? This is fun!"" He gave a big anarchy speach to Two-Face and practically jizzed his pants when Harvy put a gun to his head and flipped a coin to decide weather or not to pull the trigger. But we never saw him to be the type to torture and kill just for his own sick pleasure. It was always a game or a political statement. This Joker (and the comic Joker) seem to be more evil and tourturous. Like ""im not playing games of chance here. I just want to hurt and torture and kill because its fun and I get sick pleasure from inflicting pain and suffering onto others"". Two different Jokers. I dont think Heath's sly smart and cunning Joker would work as well as a purly evil deranged psychopath. And im very much looking forward to this one.¬†  Thanks for reading.

So if I sound biased I'm sorry: I think this movie looks kinda bad. It doesn't look HORRIBLE, but it isn't the greatest thing DC has made. I feel they could've done a lot more with this movie. Judging by the trailer this is after the Superman V Batman movie. I think what the should've done is put this before the Man of Steel movie, so in a way it's a double prequel. It's a prequel to Man of Steel in a sort, and it's also showing what Batman has gone up against in the past. Also the Joker looks absolutely horrible. There's no topping Heath Ledger's Joker, but even with his Joker out of the picture, this isn't the best. But that's just on looks. Also what's up with giving Killer Croc a nose?! He doesn't have a nose! Well, I know he has a nose, but they didn't even TRY to make it reptilian like. Also, I'm not trying to compare DCCU to the MCU, but I think the DCCU is making a big mistake not having Arrow and The Flash be in the DCCU. So far just by the trailer, if I had to compare this to a Marvel movie it'd have to be the MCU's Hulk.

I just don't know if I want to go to a COMIC BOOK movie and see a girl get savagely and brutally tortured. That's just me go ahead and hate me.

2015-07-18T16:41:37,"This trailer does not inspire confidence in me. Remove the haunting music and imagine more realistic sound for the scenes they show. It's mostly explosions, gunshots, and crashes. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, it's just that they seem to be banking on the action rather than the characters. Speaking of which, I can almost guarantee you the only two characters that are going to be even remotely interesting are Deadshot and Harley, since they're the only high profile villains in the linup aside from the Joker, and frankly, both of them are B-listers at best. There's also suspiciously little dialogue, which makes me think back to the main problem with MOS; solid directing and acting, but awful dialogue and a nonsensical plot. Finally, and I'm sure most of you have already realized this, but they're trying too hard to be dark and edgy, especially when it comes to the Joker. A movie that takes itself too seriously usually either becomes funny for the wrong reasons or just plain doesn't work. That's why MCU movies work so well, even the 'bad' ones. They manage to stay more lighthearted,  which actually makes people more emotionally invested in the characters and the movie itself. Which brings me to the root of the problem: DC seems to be under the impression that dark=realistic, which is just not true.

I mean The Joker is the most famous Villain everybody knows him, and obviously he needs to make sure he will impress those people with his joker style. To me personally his tattoos are fine , I mean don't forget the joker is a pshychopath and a maniac , he is capable of anything and I saw a lot of people complain about his grills , like you know the batman loves to beat the living crap out of The Joker , so it kinda obvious why he has grills. Other thing I want to add , is that his Joker is more like a comic joker when Heath's joker is more realistic one. There is different incarnations to the joker , I mean so many. For example in Death of the family comic book he actually cuts his face and glues it back on his face and apparently he also sticks his face which he cuts on the wall to prove a point to the batman. So The Joker is capable of anything , he is a crazy mental person don't forget about that. To me this Joker looks much more better then Jack Nicholson's or Heath Ledgers , and personally just maybe Leto will prove that his Joker performance is the one to remember forever even in HUNDRED YEARS TIME. I mean we all going to remember Heath's great performance and Jack's as well but I think Leto will set the bar high, I think by the look of the trailer his acting and his voice is incredible , I mean his voice reminds me a bit of Mark Hamils as well , to me he looks like a PERFECT JOKER.

That end bit where we see the Joker is probably some kind of flash back where he tortures her and in that way turns her into something akin to himself. Which means that we will be expected to accept her as a good person in actuality and that the crimes she has commited has been beyond her control. Now that sounds pretty damn interesting. She is already an interesting character, it is just that few choose to explore her. Harley is often portrayed as the scandally dressed antagonist who blindly follows and doesn't think for herself. Here she is made unattractive via makeup and costume which will allow the actress to give a good performance and the film to explore her character in depth. It removes the sexualition and objectification of the character. Which is actually quite exciting. Although DC is trying to follow in Marvels footsteps with a cinematic universe at least they are taking a new direction with their properties, which in turn makes the films look all the more appealing. Say what you will about the Joker and his visual style but at least they are trying something new and creative. Hey ,he probably won't be the real Joker anyway and instead we will get a another well developed character. Batman v Superman doesn't look very exciting with the over abundance of CGI and action scenes, so this movie will really have to make up for it.

Robin tattoo on his right upperarm, J-teardrop tattoo that almost looks like T (JT/Jason Todd), BvS-trailer showing a painted Robin Suit and lot of other cool stuff. Not to mention this Joker's age in comparison to Bruce/Batman is perfect gap for making this look more like it could be Jason/Robin. Personally I would love it a lot. It would create more depth and feelings to it. Jason was shown off as being Red Hood before, so maybe these guys turned him even darker in this series of movies ahead.

2015-07-25T00:32:33,"What a time to be alive. Hell 10-15 years ago a lot of the comic book movies that came out were ""meh"" movies at best. But with that being said, its times like these I love being fans of both Marvel and DC and not having to take sides like a lot of silly people do. And as one of the top comments says, them having completely different moods to them makes it so much more enjoyable (no burnouts) but also makes Marvel and DC incomparable.  Personally, I love the witty, sarcastic, humor side to the Marvel movies. Thats kind of the vibe I got reading the comics whereas the DC comics always kind of had the darker tone. Nolans Batman trilogy, regardless if its not in this cinematic universe, definitely set the tone for the current DCCU.¬†  All that being said, I definitely have my issues with this movie. For one, I think Will Smith was a horrible casting choice. I obviously still have a ton of faith in this movie, but even in his two scenes in this I get the sense everything he says and does will be corny and cheesy as hell. I'm also not totally sold on this Joker character. I think Leto was a perfect casting choice, and he's more than capable of performing the Joker that they want, I'm just not sure that they Joker they want is the right one. So far, I'd say people are split just from what I've seen, and you can't judge it from one sentence in the first trailer, but from the set photos of him dressing like he's going to a night club and driving a pimped out Lamborghini the tattoos and the grills, I'm just not completely sold on what theyre trying to achieve with this Joker especially when he looks like a junky meth head.",0,0,HLGCeltic24,WI3hecGO_04,0.1901785714285714,2015-07-25 00:32:33,True,True

Ok I get the fact that people are still upset of the loss of the late great heath ledger and I get he gave the best performance iv seen of a joker in live action film Im still upset to. Yes I know that jared letos joker has a few things like the tattoos and grill that people aren't to keen on but if we just calm down and unite as fans we can see that dc are trying there best to get a live comic book adaptation of the joker. Heaths was more of a anarchist where as this joker will be more of a psychopath/breaker someone that is going to grind you down till there is nothing left like the killing joke/the dark knight returns and a death in the family.  But like I said before this can be a good chance for dc to get a good comic book adaptation not only of joker but the whole dc roster.

Deep down I really want this movie to do well, and¬†I kind of¬†think it will. I always loved the Suicide Squad and again for this movie I have high hopes. However, this is what scares me: This will be the first ever live action movie featuring Harley Quinn. Now from this preview I think the role will be just fine and can handle any criticisms that may follow the movie for her character (again this is from just the trailer). Ok, second, the Joker. We've seen A LOT of different incarnations of the Joker and in present times the biggest incarnations are Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger. Now I don't know much about Jared Leto, but I have to say I am concerned with what I saw in the trailer, not really in the voice or lines we heard because those were good, but I can't buy the appearance. Don't get me wrong, I'm intrigued by this gritty look, but the teeth? And all the tattoos including the ""J"" on his face? Sorry but to me that's not Joker, it's a wannabe by my interpretation, and that's what concerns me. I'm afraid I won't be able to believe his particular performance and the rest of the movie will crash with him. Maybe it won't, but if Leto can't pull off the Joker like this trailer is leaving me to believe he can't, I think it will crash and not be good and that disappoints me.",0,0,Agent Twenty-Six,WI3hecGO_04,0.15396565656565656,2015-08-03 01:23:12,True,True

It's not true with all comic book movies but this movie needs an R rating, becuase it would make it a hell of a lot better. Thats's what I like about DC. They make their movies darker themed. Instead of marvel who makes movies that have very dumbed down violence thats ""Fun for the whole family"". Now I know violence isn't what makes a good movie. But, it adds to the story. So it can be told better and more true to the comics. I have not personally read the comic but based on the trailer and what I've heard, its not so much as family friendly.

The try hard character of Batman since Arkham Asylum.  Joker: That scene could have benefited from less lighting. I don't like having such a reveal of a character who is supposed to be terrifying. Joker is the kind of guy to take hits of Scarcrow's fear toxin just for fun. I wasn't intimidated.  Killer Croc: Yeesh... that design... I'm more embarrassed then shocked or disturbed.

His character looks fine. I'm surprised you aren't hating on Harley Quinn, saying that she should be like she was in batman.

2015-08-19T13:15:21,"I won't lie, I clicked this trailer because I saw Jared Leto portraying The Joker, which isn't surprising. he did a wonderful job in Dallas Buyer's Club, and I wasn't surprised he beat out Jonah Hill for the best supporting actor award. But, then my attention was diverted to the comments where I kept seeing ""Heath Ledger"" and The Dark Knight, and how misinformed this younger generation apparently is.   Heath Ledger studied the original Joker character, which is Jack Nicholson. I'm not at all shocked that most of you don't know that, probably wasn't born yet when the original batman came out (1989). I even remember going to see it at the movies with my mom. That Joker was a little on the comedic side, but Heath reinvented the character, making him more sinister in Nature by studying the personality profile of the Joker, not the funny character Jack portrayed in 89, which led to Heath's untimely death sadly. Jared is just continuing that persona and just from the trailer, he did a wonderful job.   As for Jared, also keep seeing thirty seconds to mars. Yes, he is the front man for that group with his brother, but that wasnt his ""big break"". What alot of people don't know is Jared has been an actor for a very long time before Thirty seconds to Mars, He started out in the 90's acting, in fact, I saw him for the first time in Black & White (an indie hip hop movie that tackled race and hip hop culture). He also had a small part in Phone Booth (Colin Farrell & Kiefer Sutherland), which was edited out, you only see his part on the DVD extra scenes and he was also in American Psycho. The irony in American Psycho is he was killed off by Patrick Bateman, who was played by Christian Bale, who then went on to do the Dark Knight series.   I'm just an old school movie lover. And Jared has come such a long way, he will be the Johnny Depp of this generation. He takes the edgy roles and keeps his sanity in the process, and that's a skill not very many in show business has.",66,23,Tiffy D,WI3hecGO_04,0.07996120107962214,2015-08-19 13:15:21,True,True

2015-09-14T17:15:40,"While I will agree that this Joker is much more in the comic book world here. In my personal opinion & theory, I still don't think that comic book Joker would get tattoos. The reason being is that he's a narcissist. He already thinks that he is perfect just the way he is. So why would he get tattoos and metal teeth and possibly compromise his perfection?  While I am aware that there is a comic book Joker with a tattoo on his back, the author of that story arc has always taken characters out on a limb and made them a little different... Also, the Joker may be crazy but he's still a classy guy. Even Ledger's Joker, while he was more edgy and raw, was still pretty classy! (e.g. Pushed back hair and purple suit) So, for those reasons, I could personally do without all the modifications.   However, all that being said, this is THIS world's version of the Joker!

If we remember correctly Heath Ledger had quite a few negative remarks made toward him for taking on the role of the Joker in The Dark Knight returns. After the movie was released and people saw it, then people fell in love with his role. The point is each Joker actor has done well to this point:  - Cesar Romero was a funny Joker in the 60s series which fit the part - Jack Nickolson was a flamboyant Joker with the right attitude to play the role in the 1989 movie - Heath Ledger was a psychotic twisted Joker for the 2008 movie   - Jared Leto ???????????  Time will tell on how Leto plays this role and if he fits the movie just right. However with three successors before him who played the part well, I believe Leto could be in good company IF he does this right.

2015-10-09T06:19:06,"My previous prediction for _Suicide Squad_ was this:  A good opening weekend, but a significant decline in the next week, and onwards, resulting in a film that fails to ""meet expectations"", as the studios like to put it. Among serious fans, it would be considered ""disappointing"". It will not earn a sequel, Harley Quinn will go back into ""development hell"", and we may never see Jared Leto up against Batfleck again. That was my earlier prediction. But now, the more I hear about Will Smith and his people getting involved in re-writes to the script, plus what I see in this trailer, I revise my prediction:  *This movie is going to FLOP,* except among the ""I'll watch Will Smith in anything"" crowd.  If the rumours I'm hearing are at all accurate, Will Smith is insisting on a more central role, and fundamental changes to his character. He's gonna play ruthless assasin Deadshot as yet another ""felon with a heart of gold"". We already see him hugging a young girl, presumably his daughter, Zoe. (AW, how touching, he's like Ant-Man, except for murdering people!) ' Will Smith is simply too egotistical to play an antihero or flat-out villain.  To make this film into a Will Smith vehicle, they will sacrifice scenes of depth and detail about the Joker/Harley relationship. THE BIGGEST untapped fan base for this movie is the community of fans who idealize the Harley Quinn/Joker relationship, ever since Harley was created in _Batman: The Animated Series_ in the 1990s. If this film does NOT play to that fan base, it will be an artistic and financial failure, and those disappointed, disgusted, outraged, offended fans will spread the word quickly. it's an ensemble film, but at least half the people who plan to attend want to see the Joker and Harley Quinn interact, not more ""Let's go save the world"" Will Smith cliiches.

I'm curious as to how well DC is going to connect all of it's movies, I love Marvel,  since long before everyone jumped on the comic book (movie) band wagon, as a little kid in the early 80's any takers?;) however, I think that their film continuity could be better, as in a major criminal organization, and global threat tries to very publicly murder Tony Stark and not one Avenger helps him, at all.....yeah, that really happened, nice Marvel.   Also let's pretend that the Avengers have no idea that Agent Coulson is still alive, and totally swept all events from the AOS tv show, under the rug, sure it's not that good, but you Disney said that it's officially part of your MCU, so wtf? I could site a ton of other things, but let's start there. Hopefully DC will execute the interconnectivity better, and more logically, at least mention things, like in this trailer where Waller mention Superman, and they actually included Batman in the movie;) Now that's what I'm talking about, good start.    Oh and blah, blah, blah Joker, Joker, Joker. Look! I can name 8 portrayals of the Joker outside of the comics that were very freakin' good, So I'm sure that this incarnation will be fine, there is no holy grail Joker, it's all about whoever you like, no right or wrong answer here, it's like bottled water lol;) and as for those 8, Romero, Nicholson, Ledger, and v.o.

Gangster squad, American gangster, black mass, the untouchables, or they make a movie about a bad person and make him a good guy like John wick or the last Jason movie.

I say to those people slamming leto, give him a chance. yes the look is completely different but he is not trying to copy or emulate heath ledgers joker, he is trying to make his own which is far more difficult. The joker in the comic book has gone through many iterations that have all been unique . so I say bring on this new joker, I'll reserve judgement till after I've seen the film as you all should too",6,3,Thomas Heasman,WI3hecGO_04,0.16641022021456803,2015-11-29 22:03:39,True,True

2015-11-30T19:54:27,I'm a bigger MCU fanboy than DCCU for the reason Marvel gives other characters from their universe a shot on the big screen. From DCCU all I ever hear about is Batman and Superman. Which is funny to hear DC fanboys say that Spiderman is overused in MCU. When we have had six Batmen and maybe nine Supermen? Back to the point. I'm glad to see DCCU expanding to other characters that comic readers don't know about. It is very good on their part. And a movie all about the villains of their universe is even better in my opinion. And I hope the success (If it is a good movie. Let's hope.) is enough to get Sinister Six  back on track.,1,0,Valkain,WI3hecGO_04,0.17733333333333334,2015-11-30 19:54:27,True,True

Cesar Romero, who was a campy loony clown? Heath, who came completely out of left field on the ""pretty boy haters"" as a ruthless maniacal mastermind? Or Jared Leto, who acts just as well as he sings, and has the awards to prove he can pull whatever he wants out of his arsenal at a moment's notice? It's just too freaking soon to tell. But I bet he'll do a phenomenal job and creep everyone out. We didn't see much of him at all in this trailer except the bit at the end. So...yeah.  And his teeth are fine -- I think the grill fits the whole punk-dystopian edge Suicide Squad's aesthetic has going for it -- everyone got a new twist to their look, including Harley, who doesn't look at all like her iconic harlequin red and black pantomime renditions like in the cartoons. So they gave the Joker weird teeth -- Heath's Joker looked different from Jack & Caesar's more comic book loyal looks, too.   I'm actually more worried about Will Smith's performance, tbh. Because he's more of a hit or miss actor for me -- sometimes he gives AMAZING performances, like in Happyness and Hancock and Bad Boys, but even then he can fall flat sometimes, or overact so it looks cheesy and fake.",0,0,murfeel1,WI3hecGO_04,0.07287296037296039,2015-12-05 03:01:39,True,True

The directors knows what they are doing and if jared is bad they shouldn't have recruited him in the first place... This directors are professionals they know what they are doing so I bet this movie is going to be really good and I bet jared letto is good enough to bring out the best of joker :).. so pls no more hate and lets just enjoy how good this movie is gonna be :),1,0,Jeff Cute,WI3hecGO_04,0.2617647058823529,2016-01-02 07:13:10,True,True

Then in the Frank Miller version of the comics The Dark Knight Strickes Again-  Dick Grayson gets fired from being Robin, which makes him go down a dark path, and he eventually becomes a new Joker. If you look close at the pics of the new Joker, you can see a birds wing is one the tatts on his left arm, maybe a Robin hint? Ahhh just so excited with all the new Dc films to come!

This is where it should be, concerning all the Batman and Superman movies.     But I still have much luv and respect for what Tim Burton did bk in the 90s, people forget that now, but it he refined this style right from the start. And Nolan for doing the whole grounded in real-life style.

2016-01-18T21:13:02,I am hoping that the joker has a fairly large part in this movie. I know in the animated movie he was batmans main point of attack you could say and I'm really excited to see Leto's take on the joker cause he is one of the best method actors around today. I know that Margot Robbie was scared of him at first from him being so into character. He was sending her mice or rats as gifts from the joker and sending will smith bullets or something like that I believe. Just really can't wait for this movie to come out,0,0,Casey Derrick,WI3hecGO_04,0.3676587301587302,2016-01-18 21:13:02,True,True

BTW don't just judge by his appearance, if you were a Joker fan as atleast I am, then you would be analyzing every single piece of footage of Jared as the Joker, and you will already find, even before the movie has come out, that he IS 3 dimensional character, who has all the nuanses of the Joker that we all know and love.

Now do i think Affleck makes a good Batman eh i really think him like Clooney to be just Bruce Wayne if Bats and Wayne were two seperate characters, Jared as the Joker holy shit yes from watching this tralier alone the newest one with Boheimian Raphsody takes up the crazy but the scare factor in this one is off the charts you can drop a pin after the trailer and there would be silence (i think thats how it goes?) but he is just crazy and scary, Leto was a good choice just like Ledger for the Dark Knight, course i would love to see Ledger again as the Joker but peace be upon him",0,0,Sinreven,WI3hecGO_04,0.08263888888888887,2016-03-17 09:59:15,True,True

Just look at these past movies; Spiderman 3 Amazing Spider man 1 & 2 Fan4stic BvS (Pretty sure it was studio's decision to cram in as many DC characters into 1 movie)  Sure there have been few cases when director had a full control and movie didnt turn out well but generally when it comes to big blockbusters (in this case comic book/super heroes movies) studios should just let the film maker do it on their own way.

Most of the world appears to not agree with me, but I don't care.  It was very good.    I am kinda hopeful someone else out there had a similar reaction.  By the way, are there awards for trailers?

The last minute reshoots and re-edits screwed up the original vision this movie had. When you squander around trying to cater to what you think people will like, rather than sticking to the original direction...you lose on all fronts. Why hire a director like David Ayer if you're going to smear it all at the last minute? Nolan's films worked because they were headed by a great filmmaker with little interference. Zack Snyder fails not because his movies are too serious, but because they are written badly with style over substance. It's not that people don't want to see gritty/darkness or something. We just want to see it WELL-WRITTEN, and with a committed style.  The studio heads making executive decisions for the DC cinematic universe need to stop scrambling around hoping to get liked, and have the balls to commit to something.

I mean, who out there didn't think the Joker was the main villain based on this trailer? The way they saved him until the very end of the movie. The background song.  I was a bit apprehensive when I heard WB execs panicking over the box office results and reviews of Batman vs. Superman and how they were going to tweak it to make it appear more light hearted and humorous. And my apprehensions were correct. The movie was a mess, a mish mash of odd bits and pieces of scenes that never seemed to come together. And there was hardly any Joker in the movie at all!

2016-09-12T22:48:54,This is probably my favourite trailer ever!  Now I'm going to give my opinion on the film. Quickly.  Rushed. A mess. Unorganised. Leto was OK as the joker. It would have been better if he wasn't such a big part of the marketing and promotion. Or if he just had a small cameo at the end or something. Leto's acting was good but the joker was written as this cool gangster/mob boss. I don't want that. I want to be terrified of the joker. I want him to be maniacal. Unpredictable. And chaotic. The seen in which Dr. Harleen Quinzel jumps into the tub of acid and 'becomes' Harley Quinn was done wrong.  Enchantress is useless as the antagonist. Either have joker as the antagonist or not have him in the film at all (like I said earlier).  The bar scene was good. The way the introduced the 'squad' was good. Especially deadshot (whom will smith portrayed brilliantly).  Overall the film was too cartoony and fast paced and less eerie like it was initially going to be until DC had bad reception with,4,2,Ryan Phipps,WI3hecGO_04,0.04456521739130436,2016-09-12 22:48:54,False,True

The original cut was definitely darker and grittier, but it was supposed to be, because the film is about a bunch of murderers and psychopaths being corralled into risking their lives for no tangible gain. There's also more backstory for characters that were totally sidelined in the final film, like Katana, and characters like Killer Croc are given more definition. We'll never know for sure if the original cut would have been better unless WB caves in to fans' demands and released another Director's Cut on DVD, but regardless of the quality, the original would definitely have been a much more intriguing film than the one we ended up with.",2,0,Abhi U,WI3hecGO_04,0.3,2016-09-27 17:41:25,False,True
