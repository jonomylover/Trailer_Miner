A jumble of elements that all fall into place principally through Brolin's character - he's really the center in terms of understanding the big theme here, which is one I get perfectly.  You feel overworked, stressed, unsure from the constant demands of your job  - roping in people, problems, crazy challenges, idiocies, betrayals, endless details...  You want to quit and find a door opens to an easy and lucrative opportunity, but... you know you'll never quit because you love the crazy - in this case Hollywood film making.  Josh Brolin plays this perfectly.  George Clooney is a brainless actor - also brilliantly done.  Everyone else has modest parts but they all add up:  the suits, the director (Fiennes) the religious folk, the communists, the cowboy, singers, dancers, bit part players, gossip columnists - all of them.  The film they are making, about ""The Christ"" suggests that insult to the Person or the event will occur, but it never does, and isn't meant to.  It nearly becomes saintly at the end (that faith scene here is the last one), but the Coen brothers' unique wit steps in before it gets either too noble or too mocking.

I don't think their films are particularly funny , in fact most of the time i don't even get them . It's as if i should be laughing but i'm not in on their private joke.  Hail , Caesar is about a fixer in Hollywood ( Josh Brolin) who is paid by the studio to keep the actors in line.  There are some interesting performances from George Clooney and Alden Ehrenreich and a very camp but hypnotic musical scene lead by Channing Tatum .

""The Big Lebowski""has tons of plot filler that adds nothing to the plot, and ""No Country For Old Men"" just ends on a confusing note. The biggest difference I guess is that those  movies had compelling characters and still had a some form of resolution. 'The Dude abides' somehow became a cult religion. Here, the characters are too simple, but the performances are fun. George Clooney is playing an pompous, air-headed actor; who better for that role than him?
