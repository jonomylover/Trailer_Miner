The time of the Fresh prince, when Will Smith was still a punk and of M.C. Hammer. The Rap from the new millennium finds its roots in the 80's and 90's and in the 90's it had that funk that ultimately (towards the end) made it grow into the more serious music.  I still don't know exactly what the movie is about; just some black punk kid doing what most black youngsters wanted to do back then when aiming for the music industry.

2015-03-27T00:32:14,"This is what the movie is about:  Dope is a coming of age film written and directed by Rick Famuyiwa and starring Shameik Moore,Tony Revolori, Kiersey Clemons, Blake Anderson, Zoë Kravitz, A$AP Rocky, Tyga, Keith Stanfield, Casey Veggies, Vince Staples, Chanel Iman and Rick Fox.  Malcolm is a high school geek with a high-top fade, carefully navigating life in The Bottoms, one of the toughest neighborhoods in Inglewood, California. He and his fellow outcasts share a voracious appreciation for all things '90s hip-hop, opting to sport Cross-Colours and Z. Cavariccis at the risk of being clowned at school. He dreams of attending Harvard, but first he has to make it home every day. When a drug dealer takes a shine to Malcolm and invites him to his birthday party, Malcolm’s crew is swirled into a hilarious blender of offbeat characters and bad choices where redemption can only be found in Bitcoin.  Rick Famuyiwa, born on June 18, 1973, is an emerging Hollywood writer and director of films such as The Wood (1999), Talk To Me (2007), and Brown Sugar (2002). He is a first-generation Nigerian American. His most recent film is the comedy Dope (2015) which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Famuyiwa’s films mainly explore themes of racial diversity and acceptance of oneself and others, especially within communities of color. In the majority of Famuyiwa’s films, friendship plays a central role to the characters’ development and progression throughout the film. Additionally, thus far, nearly all of Famuyiwa’s feature films have dealt with the institution of marriage in one form or another. It is helpful to note also that Rick Famuyiwa’s upbringing in the racially eclectic Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood has had a tremendous impact on his cinematic works and point of view as both an individual and artist.",8,0,crazychris4124,sNlSBM8jVOY,0.04263157894736842,2015-03-27 00:32:14,True,True
