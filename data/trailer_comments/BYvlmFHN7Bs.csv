The actor is handsome, but his appereance seems totally different from Hardin's one. Plus, he looks like a good, sweet boy, but he should be a ""bad boy"" to play Hardin. I'm curious to see how this film turned out. How can a book full of sex scenes be a film? It would probably be a porn movie, not a movie. I also think that this whole situation is kinda ridiculous. There are so many beautiful, interesting books out there, and they choose the most dreadful. C'mon people, After is full of violence, people who have sex even if they don't love each other, awful parents-children relationships... However, Anna Todd is a good writer, she is strong on writing. After plot is very interesting and it could have been a very good book if it had been shortened and rewritten, mantaining the ""basic plot"" only. The plot is not banal: a bad boy who has been through hell who falls in love with a good girl who has suffered in her life. If it were developed in a better way, than it would be a good novel. But Anna Todd is still young, she will go on and I think she will be able to write a beautiful story.

2018-11-23T11:48:42,"I have to say something. See, this is a one minute teaser, not the full trailer. What you see here, is in no way anything you can expect from this movie. And the funny thing is, people are gonna see this movie anyway, just so they can say shit about it - well, I don't give a fuck, when you go and see this movie, we will get the second one, so you'll just make us happy. I hate to see how people think Fifty Shades of Grey is ''good'' and ''different'', yet, how toxic was *that* ? This book is so different from anything I've ever read. And you know why? Because I read all the books, because I didn't just read the first one. Because I didn't listen to what people told me about this book, I just went and read it to see for myself. The first book is just the start of something huge, a very emotional yet romantic rollercoaster. Yes, the first book has toxic elements. But that's exactly what Anna Todd (the writer) wanted to show. Some people are toxic. Some relationships start off toxic. There are people with shitty childhoods and trauma's, it fucks up who they are. There are people who can't love anyone. And Anna Todd wanted to show people what effect people can have on people. Tessa changed Hardin, in ways he never thought possible. And you guys have no clue how, because none of these haters have read every single word of the five books out there. You're basing your opinion on opinions you've heard on social media, on reading a few chapters, on reading the first book but nothing more, on the fact that this is ''based off a boyband and it's a fanfiction''. Who the fuck cares??? Aside from the fact that the only thing about One Direction she ever used were their names and their looks, I have a surprise for you, Fifty Shades was based off of Twilight: A FANFICTION. To All The Boys I've Loved Before, The Kissing Booth, Fifty Shades - they're all fanfiction turned into movies. The difference? This writer chose to discuss something that's different from other fanfiction for teenagers. She chose to discuss REAL PROBLEMS THAT SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY GO THROUGH. Do I like Tessa and Hardin's relationship in the first book? God, no. I hate how Hardin drives her mad. I hate the influence he's got on her. I hate his intentions. BUT THAT'S THE POINT. Hate him! He's fucked up. You're hating him as much as Tessa does at first, as much as Noah does, as much as Tessa's mom does. You're hating Hardin as much as he hates himself. But that changes. The story changes. The intentions change. Hardin changes. Tessa changes. In the other books, it's not even about their mental influence on each other anymore. It's about who they are - and about who Tessa and Hardin help each other to become. But y'all haters didn't know this, did you? No, cause you've never even cared to read the whole story to understand anything about this. If you hate it so much and refuse to understand the story, then LEAVE. Don't watch this movie, don't watch this teaser, don't talk to the fandom. Don't bother, go somewhere else. If it's so bad, do all of us a favor and just leave. This movie is becoming a thing anyway and you can't do anything about it. Go give hate to something that actually deserves hate.

2018-11-24T02:47:34,"(COMENTARIO DE SARA EN ESPA√ëOL)   Necesito decir algunas cosas;  1. Harry Styles ya no est√° relacionado con esta pel√≠cula, una vez estuvo hace muchos a√±os, se acab√≥ ahora.  2. S√≠, esta relaci√≥n es t√≥xica, pero recuerda que son adolescentes y a√∫n no han madurado, pero saben que lo har√°n pronto.  3. Hero y Harry no deben ser comparados. Hero se basa en la versi√≥n publicada del libro y Harry era solo un fan fiction.  4. S√≠, esta pel√≠cula tendr√° muchas escenas expl√≠citas, pero recuerda que son adolescentes y que pronto madurar√°n.  5. Esta relaci√≥n comienza muy t√≥xica, pero debes saber que no siempre es lo mismo.  6. Harry Styles no tiene NADA que ver con esta pel√≠cula. (S√≠, lo he dicho otra vez)  7. En los libros, esta relaci√≥n era m√°s t√≥xica, pero debido al p√∫blico, cambiaron MUCHAS cosas en esta pel√≠cula para que sea m√°s apropiada para la audiencia.  8. No todos disfrutar√°n o entender√°n esta pel√≠cula, no es su clich√© t√≠pico.  9. Si realmente hab√≠a una raz√≥n para odiar en esta pel√≠cula basada en Harry Styles, no hay raz√≥n. Recuerde que este libro fue escrito por una ni√±a hace muchos a√±os que apenas era conocido por CUALQUIERA y comenz√≥ a escribir fan fiction (como muchos libros de Wattpad en estos d√≠as). M√°s tarde, cuando el libro recibi√≥ m√°s atenci√≥n y se hizo famoso, era bastante obvio que no pod√≠a mantener el nombre de Harry si lo iba a publicar, por lo que se cambi√≥ a Hardin. Ahora, cuando se estrena la pel√≠cula, se asegur√≥ de deshacerse de cualquier cosa que no le gustara al p√∫blico, diferente de leer un libro.  10. Sepa que esta pel√≠cula es ahora propia, y no tiene m√°s v√≠nculos con nadie / nada.  Edici√≥n: muchos de tus comentarios hablan sobre c√≥mo esta pel√≠cula es tan t√≥xica y he tratado de minimizar la mierda. Bueno, d√©jame explicarte y habr√° spoilers, as√≠ que ten cuidado.  ¬†Hardin tuvo una infancia muy jodida, sin figura paterna y su madre tambi√©n fue violada y √©l estuvo all√≠ para presenciar toda la escena. Creci√≥ con la mente jodida y ten√≠a pesadillas todas las noches. No estaba mentalmente bien y necesitaba ayuda, pero siempre se mantuvo alejado de la terapia porque no quer√≠a cambiar, no quer√≠a ser una mejor persona porque sab√≠a que estaba jodido y que nadie pod√≠a arreglarlo. Cuando Tessa entra en su vida, todav√≠a es t√≥xico porque sabe que esta pel√≠cula se basa en una apuesta y no le importaron los sentimientos en ese momento porque no le importaba a qui√©n lastim√≥. Cuando arruina la mente de Tessa, se da cuenta de lo que ha estado haciendo porque realmente la amaba. A lo largo del libro, √©l trat√≥ de cambiar para ella y para todos los dem√°s muchas veces. Y tuvo √©xito muchas veces tambi√©n. En el segundo libro, madur√≥ mucho y tambi√©n Tessa y Hardin no fueron tan abusivos como √©l. Sepa que hay 5 libros, cada libro tiene su propia historia y cambia. Hardin madur√≥ MUCHO el tiempo y recibi√≥ terapia porque Tessa le hab√≠a hecho cambiar su opini√≥n sobre la vida. Hardin odiaba a los ni√±os desde el fondo de su coraz√≥n, pero Tessa cambi√≥ eso y al final (ep√≠logo) tuvieron hijos propios. A Hardin no le gustaban muchas cosas, pero Tessa siempre lo cambiaba para √©l y, cuando no estaba en una relaci√≥n con Tessa (interrumpida), hac√≠a una mierda jodida porque la extra√±a y sabe que lo que hizo estuvo mal. Hardin estaba jodido, Tessa entr√≥ en su vida, se arruinaron la una a la otra, pero pronto, crecieron y maduraron juntos y esta relaci√≥n NO va a seguir siendo la forma en que se ve. Si no ha le√≠do la versi√≥n publicada de los libros, entonces no haga predicciones y hable sobre algo que no conoce completamente. La versi√≥n de Wattpad fue escrita por una mujer joven cuando ni siquiera era famosa (s√© que mucha gente lo hace ahora) y Harry Styles est√° completamente fuera de escena, pero Anna todav√≠a tiene los libros en Wattpad, as√≠ que sus compa√±eros fan√°ticos no pueden puede pagar la versi√≥n publicada del libro y, o no tener acceso a √©l, a√∫n puede leer la versi√≥n anterior de After si lo desean.  Debo haberte consentido mucho, pero debes saber que este libro se basa en algo realista, no es un primer amor de secundaria y un problema te rompe y pronto vuelven a estar juntos y se casan. No entiendo por qu√© a la gente le gusta ver cosas exageradas no originales una y otra vez y no querr√≠a ver algo realista. Al igual que 13rw habl√≥ sobre Bullying, Suicidio y Asalto Sexual y a muchas personas no les gust√≥ ver cosas de las que nadie habla. Insaciable, algo que a muchas personas no les gustaba ver cosas de las que normalmente no se habla.  Perd√≥n por la perorata, sepa que estoy defendiendo las razones correctas y que sus opiniones son suyas, pero tenga en cuenta que a veces sus opiniones lastiman a las personas, es mejor quedarse callado de esa manera.    Edici√≥n 2: si tienes que odiar algo, emp√∫jalo en el culo porque a nadie le importa una mierda",10,1,Nicole Folgar,BYvlmFHN7Bs,0.16666666666666666,2018-11-24 02:47:34,True,True

If every movie, book, etc. had perfectly saint characters then things would get 1)real boring real fast and 2)just not realistic at all. There are TONS of genres and TONS of different relationships. As long as it‚Äôs obvious that the relationship is toxic and is NOT romanticized and is given a proper rating to make sure it‚Äôs only seen by a certain age group then I don‚Äôt see what the problem is. Imagine someone making a movie about Hitler or some serial killer or other messed up things that happen IN REAL LIFE and have people be upset about it. Why? There are people analyzing movies and books everyday. They know the relationships being portrayed and they‚Äôre actively discussing them. This is just a normal part of life. Nothing is sunshine and rainbows all the time. If this movie is romanticizing the relationship then okay, that‚Äôs wrong. But if it‚Äôs NOT romanticizing it and is just portraying it as the toxic one that it is then I don‚Äôt see any problem. That‚Äôs just my opinion.

In the movie I bet they will remove most of the  important scene (as they can't put 100 chapters in 3 hour movie) and because of this I don't want this book to be another clich√©  or anything Wattpad version has lots of mistakes and things that doesn't make any sense (according to me) And the part that they always end up having sex annoys me to hell Bit still o don't want that in the movie  Because they just CAN'T END UP HAVING SEX AFTER EVERY GOOODAMN FIGHT YOU KNOW but as people love this book so much this movie has this huge responsibility to maintain that image of the book ..

This has nothing related to Harry Styles or One Direction in any way. Stop complaining about how Hero doesn't look like Harry. Anna was only inspired by Harry's looks when she wrote After, I repeat: INSPIRED; which means that Hero is not supposed to look (exactly) like Harry. Most of movies are inspired by something, but they are movies on their own. Moreover, this film is an adaptation, I repeat: ADAPTATION, which also means that some things can be changed (scenes or looks). If some One Direction fans came here just to see a movie with the actors looking like their faves: this isn't your place, you can go.

2018-11-26T02:00:39,"OKAY, let‚Äôs not blame the book, the film AND claim that the people who are defending it are people who‚Äôs abusive and toxic. The book and film is not trying to promote ANY kind of abuse or toxic behavior AT ALL and this is coming from someone who had parents that were pretty rough with each other. But PEOPLE like you here that are quick to label this film as a promotion to send out the message that being in an abusive and toxic relationship is okay is exactly the REASON why it seems like the book and film itself is romanticizing and glorifying it when IT IS NOT. YOU‚ÄôRE CREATING A MISUNDERSTANDING TO THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER READ OR KNOWN ABOUT AFTER. It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt like the book and upcoming movie for it because everyone is entitled to what they‚Äôre into and what they aren‚Äôt into BUT YOU CANNOT shove your opinion down someone‚Äôs throat and put what you think as a  LABEL and tape it on something. AND to those who are worried for Harry‚Äôs reputation, YES the media will link this to him but the media itself KNOWS that this is a film inspired by HARRY from a fan. The book and film itself isn‚Äôt supposed to portray who Harry is as a person, GET THAT. And everyone knows that Harry treats everyone with kindness and so should we but here you guys are, already labeling this film and book series as another fifty shades or a promotion to toxic relationship which is exactly what Harry will have to put up with if PEOPLE keep making these comments. But do know that you cannot tell everyone here that it‚Äôs going to ruin Harry‚Äôs reputation because the media will link it to him when YOU YOURSELF are doing the exact same thing by mentioning his name to this series when he was never associated to the book series other than an inspiration the author had used as a fan. HARRY‚ÄôS REPUTATION DOES NOT DEPEND ON A FICTIONAL CHARACTER. LASTLY, this is NOTHING like fifty shades of grey though the author had said it was inspired by it. It‚Äôs just like how she was inspired by Harry‚Äôs looks. WATCH AND READ the series before labeling it a parody of teen fifty shades.

They broke up and got back together over and over again. After a while, this became very boring.  The only explanation I have is that Tessa had very low self-esteem and Hardin was sociopathic. She could have gotten a much better boyfriend. The book was very illogical and unrealistic.  I hope that no one will believe they have to put up with such abusiveness in order to have a relationship.

2018-11-28T14:07:50,"Tbh I don't really think that Anna Todd wanted to romanticize abusive relationships. In the books, Tessa and the people around her, even Hardin, always recognize his (and hers, sometimes) obssessive and toxic behavior. Even tho the main point is the relationship between Tessa and Hardin, and they're certainly in love, the damaging conduct is never well seen - that's exactly why the relantionship continues to fall apart. Eventually, they do find a way to grow up and be better - for themselves and for each other. I'm NOT saying that if you're on a abusive relantionship you should stay and hope that it'll get better - no, you should definitely run the opposite direction. But i'm saying that there's no romantic point of view of what's bad in this relantionship, it is always pointed out and criticized.",0,0,Olivia S,BYvlmFHN7Bs,0.11742424242424244,2018-11-28 14:07:50,True,True

That has literally happened in every other one of these stories, whether it be Divergent or Fifty Shades of Grey. You‚Äôre not proving your point at all and you‚Äôre further proving ours. The fact that the male lead had a messed up childhood is not and nowhere near justification for his actions and has been overdone to high hell, also notably in Fifty Shades. It‚Äôs nearly impossible for me to not view this as a less graphic version of Fifty Shades of Grey geared toward the teenage demographic. It was literally a wattpad fanfiction, and I‚Äôm sure it was the one that helped kick off the trope in modern young adult novels in the first place. There‚Äôs really no deeper meaning. It was an erotic fanfiction geared toward hormonal youth. That‚Äôs all there is to it. None of your white-knighting will change any of our opinions on it.

2018-12-22T09:21:28,"Can people in the comments stop hating After just because it was on Wattpad. There are actually a lot of good stories on Wattpad u people probably have never read. Don't blame the book or Wattpad for this cringe. The book is nothing like this cringy trailer for the movie. The problem is book to movie/Tv show adaptions are never really good or have the same tone. This trailer makes it seem like some cringy sexual college teen perfect romance all about sex when in actuality it was nothing like that in the book. Harry/Hardin had a lot of anger problems (took it out on people including tessa), got drunk a lot to forget his issues, hated his father who left him and his mother with all the money making them super poor and started a new family in america (which he hated them to for being to ""perfect"" and made a whole new ""perfect"" family) and hated how his mom lied to him about where his college money really came from (aka his rich dad who left them) since they were poor. He was always an asshole to tessa who was told by others that harry/hardin was no good he was just some bad boy who got drunk/partied and had sex to much but she didn't believe them and knew there had to be more to his story. She saw who he truly was an how they both were into literature (The scene in the trailer made it sexual but in the book he yells at her and gets mad that she is in his room touching his books no one knows he's into). In the beginning he would push her away and after a while of I hate u they started having sex but he was still an ass and was basically just using her because he lost trust in people along time ago so he didn't want to get to invested in someone who would leave him like everyone else. He didn't come to his senses and realize he loved her until after she had had enough of his drama and wanted no part with him. Later when they are actually a couple she tries to help him with his family problems. They live together and are dating until she finds out all this was some drunken bet at a party. (this was back when he was a drunken ass) The point is the book is not what the trailer makes it out to be. Don't blame Wattpad or the book in general (which is a lot more complex then the movie seems to be) when it's obvious the movie is what sucks! Book to movie or Tv show adaptions have a lot of times sucked and made a decent book seem cringy/awful when it really isn't.",1,0,Cheekbones x Dimples,BYvlmFHN7Bs,0.01595849802371542,2018-12-22 09:21:28,True,True

I made Hero Fiennes, from After (2019) (he was in Harry Potter played younger Tom Riddle). I studied him in real life and spent 3 hours making him. As well as putting correct personalities and interests. I put him as an adult because he is 20 in real life. He is a business man who wants to be rich (succeeding after spending on mansion stuff he has $1,942,022), he is romantic, a musician and neat. I also spent 8 hours creating his mansion once he made a lot of money. I did use someone's mansion layout but the furniture, flowers, lighting stove, bathrooms are all created by me. I every night (once sister showed me how to keep screen from turning off) I left him on the max arrow forward and he made all the money on his own. I used 0 cheats on him. I think he would make an excellent edition to your characters.

2019-01-04T13:55:48,"Don't get me wrong. I think that it is great that erotica with substance do get their limelight moments, but to title this a great phenomen is definitely nonsense. I never understood why books such as Fifty Shades Of Grey and After sold out whilst books with important messages and questions remain in the shelves. I mean I am glad that women and men now do have the liberty to openly speak about sex, porn, kinks whatsoever. But I do not see a virtue, a value this movie tries to convey. Of course, not every movie has to have moral values, but I just do not understand why sexual stuff that is half-porn gets so hyped up. Live your life the way you want to, but this book or series is not considered literature by me in anyways. And before you ask, yes I actually tried to read the first book. It wasn't horrible per se, but you know unsubstantial. Same overused trope of good girl falling head over heels for the bad boy and his charms. This really shouldn't be celebrated as much as it gets.

Tessa is okay, although she has not the same body as book Tessa , which kinda disturbs me because Tessa was called fat multiple times and I wish that movie Tessa would represent girls who have more weight. Hardin looks like a 16 year old boy who just got out of juvie. His friends (including Zed) look like they are around 30 years old and already have like 3 children. Molly has the body that Tessa should've had,I don't want to mention what happened to Steph and Tristan because , why should I freak out again about it? Some scenes that I recognized or not even close to the book: For example , when in Jesus name, did Hardin ask Tessa CALMLY what she was doing in his freaking room? He yelled at her, took his book from her, and threw it away. And when in Jesus name, did he say that she owns him a dare? Lets not forget, that TESSA was the one who approached him first , who kissed him. I am sorry but Tessa and Hardin look like siblings. I mean, c'mon guys? There are more things I don't like about the movie , But I will give it a try out of loyalty towards the after series. But to be honest, I think there could have been a better cast.

2019-07-09T15:58:09,"BRO I LEGIT JUST WATCH THE MOVIE, I AM COMPLETE AND UTTERLY SHOOK IT GENUINELY SUCKS!!  I'm so upset and I don't even know why. I promise I am not trying to spread hate or bring down Anna Todd's work, but this movie was actually genuinely horrible! I can't even sugar coat it, people who say the movie was 'Amazing' are either completly lying or haven't read any of the books yet. Idk but for me, the movie was just all over the place, the characters were nothing like how they were portrayed in the books. FIRSTLY WHY IS HARDIN SO GOD DAMN NICE? When he was like ""I'm sorry for the way I've treated lately"" I was like hold up, homebody you've done absolutely nothing to her wdym mean you are sorry, and wtf is he apologising. Hardin Scott in the novels would never have apologised, let alone be nice to her throughout the beginning of their relationship!   EVEN MORE TEA! homegurl was mad because he said he doesn't want to date after 'everything they did,' they did nothing in the lake scene! If it wasn't for the book and knowing what they actually did in the lake scene, I would have never cared with they didn't decide to date because of all he did was tickle her arm and rub her tummy wtf! AND PLUS why was there no competition whatsoever with Zed aka Zayn, LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT HOT SWEETHEART, THAT MADE HARDIN MAD BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS A GENTLEMAN AND WAS ALWAYS ON THE VERGE OF STEALING HIS MRS!!!!!    HONESTLY! In my opinion, there was no storyline here or a great plot, the producers of this movie threw in a bunch of 'iconic' moments in the story and called it a day! which is completly a bad idea, there was no development of the relationships between the characters and it was just a bunch of random scenes in the movie like why tf were they even there. NOT TO MENTION, KAREN!!! KAREN WAS ADORABLE IN THE STORY AND THEY JUST MADE HER SOUND ALL STUCK UP AND STUFF! Tessa and Karen were supposed to be bff and then we get this awkward first impression, no hug or relationship at all scene and it was just hard to watch.   not even gonna lie this was the movie. THERE WERE TEN MILLION AWKWARD PAUSES IN EVERY SCENE LIKE NOBODY WAS TALKING THERE were JUST AWAKWARD MOMENTS OF SILENCE! Bro and they would have a small problem and straight after that they would be making out or in this case, Hardin would be hiding behind Tessa's thigh.    JUST PLEASE CONSIDER- IF U DONT READ THE BOOK YOU WILL BE A LOSTY AND NOT UNDERSTAND HALF THE THINGS GOING ON, SO PLEASE BE PREPARED FOR THAT! If you are planning to watch the movie still then please, by all means, watch it, but don't expect nothing but the same stuff in the trailer. I honestly loved the books, I have read every single one of them and they are just amazing. But even those who read it on watt pad the og's will be soooo upset. There is no plot or context behind these characters it's almost like they expect us to all the know the story before going in and watching this movie. There was nothing exciting about it (I mean except hero being shirtless for several minutes) But other than that, It was repetitive and not gonna lie straight-up boring.    I'm just so sad because I know this story and series is amazing, I wished more people knew about it but this story is not a good way to promote the story! Hardin was supposed to be broken at first, he was supposed to have a rude attitude and f**k around all the time, Not some perfect boy that says 'please' and 'thank you' and prayers with his family before he eats.   IM SO UPSET PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU PLEASE REMAKE THIS WHOLE MOVIE!! BECAUSE IF YOU WATCHED THE MOVIE AND THEN DECIDE TO READ THE BOOK, EVERYTHING WILL BE A SUPRISE TO U BECAUSE IT IS LEGIT TO DIFFERENT THINGS :(   p.s Where tf is the part when Hardin throws Tessa's notes everywhere scene and the zed and tessa scene and the night they spent at hardins fathers house and the internship office scenes and the showers scenes WHAT DO U MEAN THE ENTIRE BOOK IS MISSION FROM THE MOVIE IM SO SADDDDDD, I WANNA CRY IN A HOLE AND NEVER COME OUT UNTIL THEY MAKE A BETTER VERSIONNN   Please dont think this is hate, Just my opinion and the truth and the tea :)",1,0,Cindy,BYvlmFHN7Bs,-0.06994010040885039,2019-07-09 15:58:09,False,True
