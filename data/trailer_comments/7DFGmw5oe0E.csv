The Apostle Paul is the father of the faith of Christianity and he did not get his just rewards in this movie. James Faulkner was well casted for the part unfortunately the character of Paul was not developed in this movie because they didn't flash back to anything that he did that was unbelievably riveting as in the book of Acts. There are so many things that were downers about this movie.

2018-04-01T12:24:24,Paul did not get along with Peter. Maybe it's because he was more of the elite and educated while Peter was a fisherman. Instead of fighting each other they decided to go their own way spreading the gospel. Mark became Peter's secretary and Luke became Paul's. The objective was always to spread the gospel and not to build kingdoms on Earth. That was the command. Paul's efforts after his death eventually saw the church spread all the way to Asia where even the Nestorians and Manicheans had adherents in China while the Peter branch decided to do the wrong thing after his death: build kingdoms.,3,1,Lauro Andrea,7DFGmw5oe0E,0.095,2018-04-01 12:24:24,False,True

2020-05-11T04:32:38,"Is Paul's name going to be written on the foundation of the city of New Jerusalem? It's a yes or no answer.  Let your answer be yes or no. If yes, then which of the 12 apostles (Matthias replaced the evil Judas Iscariot) will have his name stricken? Will it be Andrew or Peter? James or John? Do tell. If no, then Saul / Paul is no apostle. Saul / Paul is the role model of the televangelist of today. Paul was in it for the money.  1 Corinthians 9 tells anyone all she or he needs to know about Saul / Paul. Paul seems to have conspired with Luke.   What do we know of Luke? Luke was not an apostle. And Luke was the traveling companion of Saul / Paul, the zealot evangelist and the self-anointed apostle.   Right from the start, Luke tells us that he has written, what is, in effect, a book report, taken from the anonymous works of others. But who instructed Theophilus? Was he taught by Saul / Paul? It seems likely since Luke was Saul / Paul's buddy.   Luke also wrote 18 parables not found in either Mark or Matthew. Matthew was an apostle. Likely, Mark was the transcriptionist for Peter. But who is Luke except some guy hanging around the persecutor of Christians, Saul, who gave himself a new identity, Paul.   We do not know if Luke took from false gospels being circulated. As Luke is not mentioned in the gospels of Mark, Matthew and John, the latter two being actual apostles, we have no way of knowing who is Luke. How can anyone know if Luke had the Holy Spirit in him to let him accept only authentic gospels from which he pieced together his work?    Luke and Paul have a weird, different take on the Last Supper from Matthew, an eyewitness and from Mark, Peter's guy. Both Mark and Matthew match in their accounts.   Only Luke and Paul spin a story about Jesus appearing before Peter. John, Matthew and Mark fail to mention something as important as that.   Luke and Paul share a vocabulary not found in all of the other works of the New Testament. Luke and Paul share 101 words not found in any of the other writers of NT books.",0,0,TruthFoot,7DFGmw5oe0E,-0.05275974025974026,2020-05-11 04:32:38,False,False
