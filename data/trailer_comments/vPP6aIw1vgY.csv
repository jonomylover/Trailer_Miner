2017-07-20T17:11:32,"Good trailer but calm down, guys, here's what's wrong with this trailer: I' a huge jugsaw fan and I think there are a few things wrong with this trailer, like the new traps for example, they look brand new, shiny and high tech, not the junk we knew and loved about the movies because they show how smart jigsaw is to build some amazing traps from used scraps, even the ""copy"" ones like the angel trap and the reverse bear trap somehow don't look as threatening as the past movies. another thing is the fact that the scenes are too bright and colorful, maybe they are going for a different set like a farm in daytime or something to follow the new horror flicks gimmic but I think that means taking away the creepy darkness we are used to.  About the plot I think (from seeing the trailer of course) that the police would suspect an inside killer because nobody in the public could have seen the traps (only police did while investigating the crime scenes), and I believe they'll pull out a twist showing tobin bell, and telling us he didn't make the first traps (or at least not alone) and that he plained this from the very  beginning(explaining his blood that was preserved by the killer and the ""games have just begin"" tape from saw4). the killer might even be someone we've already seen as a secondary role in the past but I don't want to spoil this anymore for you.

He was 17 in saw 2 so he would be 27 because this movie takes place 10 years later. Also this makes sense also he befriended Amanda young  who was one of the first jigsaw accomplices. So it makes sense if he takes on the mantle as the jigsaw killer. But Dr. Gordon is  also a good guess because at the end of the movie he kidnaps Hoffman with the help of 2 other pig masked goons which could be any of the survivors. Maybe Daniel helped Dr Gordon?

The more modernised approach with the pure white room, LED lights with clean and elaborate traps makes it feel very different from a saw movie but then again it might have been what they were going for by going without dim light bulbs and rusted, disgusting blades. The new approach also makes sense since it would take place in a more modern time and with a new Jigsaw with a different style. Quite honestly i would have hoped they would have laid the series to rest with the excellent Dr Gordon twist at the end of Saw 3D but it is interesting to see if they will pull off the more modern tone and a classic Saw twist.

2017-07-21T05:33:14,"Okay so I think I got it slightly figured out after going cut after cut through the trailer. Do not read further if you don't want spoilers.  Ten Years after Saw 3D, Matt Passmore, Callum Keith Rennie, Cle Bennett and Hannah Emily Anderson are detectives/coroners/investigators who are in charge of figuring out who this new killer is. Is it an accomplice no one knew about (other than Dr. Gordon), or a copycat? Either way, whoever this new killer is, will have a tie with John Kramer, since there is a brief frame of John Kramer taking photographs at 1:28. It also appears that there may be more than one killer. Perhaps its a cult? It appears Cle Bennett and Callum Keith Rennie are the lead detectives, investigating multiple suspects places, as well as new evidence as the investigation team keeps digging. Matt Passmore and Hannah Emily Anderson seem to be the coroners/forensic team, as they seem to be investigating the location of the farm at 1:49 after or even during everything that is happening with our four to five victims.  Our victims consist of Laura Vandervoort (red haired woman), Mandela Van Peebles (guy plaid shirt with black long sleeve underneath), Paul Braunstein (guy with grey hoodie who made the cringey comic relief line near the end) and Brittany Allen (blonde haired woman). The fifth victim is unknown, either already dead or unconscious, and they are either horribly cut to death or their corpse is chopped to pieces by the saws. It appears, though, everyone will try to cut the chains with the saws, but will wind up accidentally cutting themselves, as it can be seen there is blood near their own individual spots. These four people are together because they're connected somehow. The only clips of Brittany Allen are her with the chain around her neck, while the other three are seen to later not have them on, so more than likely she'll die second. it also appears the other three gain up on her with the syringes, despite the fact in later scenes Laura and Mandela are trying to help each other, so maybe Brittany is the new Obi. There is a clip of her, possibly spying on someone from behind a fence, so maybe she drugged them, and then somebody drugged her. Paul Braunstein appears to be trying to purposefully kill Mandela and Laura, as he appears to be out for himself. He'll try locking them in a silo that fills up and begins dropping farm equipment on them, but they manage to escape, but not unscathed. It can be noticed how Laura goes from wearing a black jacket in the beginning, to her long sleeved red shirt in the silo, and finally down to black tank top. As the traps keep going, she keeps removing more of her clothes, probably because she keeps getting hurt. Paul Braunstein will get his legs in a trap and possibly lose his feet. Either way, Paul dies third. It will come down to Laura and Mandela with Mandela suspended upside down by a trap activated by a running motorcycle, being lowered into something narrow that will cut him up, and Laura has to stop the motorcycle from cutting him up. If she doesn't do so in time, Mandela may be the fourth victim. There is a brief shot of Mandela locking a door (bracelet on his wrist), so he'll either do this to kill Paul, or perhaps to betray Laura at the very end, making her the fourth and possible final kill if she saves Mandela from the suspended trap.  It was mentioned a while back that there will be a speed race death trap in the movie, so that might explain the trash truck running over a motorist, and a red speed car crashing into a police vehicle trying to stop it. There is the shot of two cars crashing into each other and exploding, but that occurs at night, so either this speed race goes all day and night, or its separate from the death race. The driver of the one car in the explosion appears to have a vest on, and Callum Keith Rennie is wearing a dress shirt and tie, a VEST, and jacket. Maybe he's the driver of that car, maybe its nothing. Matt Passmore appears to be put in a head trap that has laser beams on it, so more than likely he'll be the last trap and/or death of the movie, and more than likely not the new killer. My suspicions on who the killer(s) will be, based on the trailer and actors' previous roles, will be Hannah Emily Anderson because of how giddy she seemed when she said ""It's Jigsaw"", or Callum Keith Rennie, because the guy was the badass John Wakefield in ""Harper's Island"". Maybe Hannah is just giddy at discovering clues at crime scenes. Maybe Callum won't be typecasted as a villain this time. Either way, I think one of the new killers has to be someone in the police department.  Wow, I spent WAY too much time looking into this. Thoughts or opinions?  EDIT: Also, for whatever reason, the cast on IMDB mentions that two of the victims, Mandela Van Peebles as Mitch and Brittany Allen as Carly, have two actors playing Look-a-likes in the movie. James Gomez as Mitch Look-a-like, Lauren Beatty as Carly Look-a-like, and Michael Boisvert as an actor. Unless the IMDB cast list is wrong (which wouldn't be surprising at all), it tells me this movie has to do with a Hollywood film crew, or possible going Meta. Yeah, this will definitely feel like a horror comedy at parts.",242,25,ZWKA1,vPP6aIw1vgY,0.008462918660287078,2017-07-21 05:33:14,True,True

We already know that Hoffman during Saw 7, was not hosting the main game but someone else was, as Hoffman was watching, waiting for Jill, and of course he was hiding in the body bag for the majority of the movie for the right time to sneak inside the police station. We already know that there are at least four possible Jigsaw Hosts, Adam, Detective Tapp, Daniel Matthews, and Officer Rigg, obviously Doctor Gordon too, but that'll be too obvious. This game looks very very un-experienced due to previous tests, asif someone is being taught, leading up to either a reboot, hence the name Jigsaw, not officially Saw 8, a revelation movie to toe up all the loose connections, or maybe this was Gordon's game and takes place right before or during Saw 7.

2017-07-24T04:55:59,"Love the first two Saw movies; not feeling this at all. Seems like just another reboot/sequel/retcon/whatever this turns out to be. It's weird too, Saw is such a simple concept; ""Maniac puts victims in torturous, fatally dangerous games that force them to appreciate the life they squandered. Games are themed to the victim's shortcomings."" It's the kind of movie that I wouldn't mind seeing a good old fashion reboot from square one of, since the sequels are mostly terrible, and they haven't actually made one in 7 years. And yet, at least from the trailer (which admittedly tells us nothing), they seem to want to keep with the continuity of the franchise, that Jigsaw has been dead for 10 years and he's back somehow SO SPOOKY. That's a stupid idea, straight up. The whole point of wrapping up Saw 3D with ""Gordon was the mastermind"" was to admit fault of 7 movies worth of plot holes and just END THE SERIES. But now they're firing up the ol' machine again to give er a nother go, and I cannot be any less interested.   I grew impatient with the franchise when it became about connecting a gory kill to the next gory kill, and yet the only thing that interests me about this new movie, is knowing that I'll be able to watch clips of all the death scenes on youtube a year from now. The story is probably total garbo, so why bother even seeing it, y'know?  BTW, here's the twist, ready? Gordon is still at large. They're finding Jigsaw's DNA because Gordon is planting DNA at the crime scenes to throw off the feds. They will show a flashback scene of Gordon tampering with Jigsaw's body and taking samples. Or Hoffman will be alive somehow, since he was the last dangling thread keeping the story alive. You might say, ""hey buddy, that doesn't make any sense. It doesn't work like that"". Exactly. And that's why it will be the twist.",0,0,jeeshwa123,vPP6aIw1vgY,-0.006886209029066178,2017-07-24 04:55:59,True,True

I mean, yes this is gruesome, sick, gory, etc etc etc. But, I really like the background and the purpose of the killer. I mean, Jigsaw is basically a serial killer in a slasher movies. In other slasher movies, the serial killer kills mostly just because they are psycho and likes to kill. But in here, Jigsaw actually sick with people who don't appreciate their life and done injustice to other people, and he wants to teach them the value of life. I mean, all (or most) of his victims are bad people with sins, some are real criminals, and most of them really wasting their life or ruining the life of others.  Yeah, maybe this looks like some lame excuse for him to kill, but he really believes that he helps people. And even some people who fell victim of his traps becoming his apprentice because they really appreciate of what he had done.

Notice that there are two guys in the trailer (hoffman is the one holding the beartrap) wearing a jumper or jumpsuit (idk what its called).    My Big Question is why Jigsaw's DNA still there ?   The first part of the trailer is the public trap created again by someone who created the love triangle in saw3d. could it be adam who are creating public traps ? cause jigsaw and hoffman is not a fan of that type of games.",0,0,Kenny Gauran,vPP6aIw1vgY,0.1357142857142857,2017-08-07 09:00:10,True,True

Ghost stories and possessions? Come on, I leave more entertainment in my toilet. I know they are trying to reach a larger audience, I just hope they do not tarnish the legacy of SAW.   For REAL fans of SAW, it was the gore, or the blood that we loved, it was the uniqueness of the story. It was different, it grabbed your attention and ALWAYS left you wanting more. Sitting in the theatres you'd try to be a deceive, try to figure it out before it played out on screen. You tried to think ""How to get out?"" ""Would I sacrifice something in order to save myself or someone I love?"" You would put yourself in their shoes, you want to figure out the movie as its happening, there were so many twists and turns, just when you thought you knew the answer, the game changed. THAT'S why we love SAW. The uniqueness behind it, the ripple effect of the story, the spiderweb linking it all together.   I know I'm different, I usually don't turn my brain off when watching a movie, I want to feel apart of it, in it, feel like it steams from reality, not some ridiculous over the top jumpscare crap-fest. The Jigsaw movie (from what I currently understand) MUST be a copycat film, without the main characters in the SAW universe, it's the only way it could go without tarnishing the legacy, and still build upon it.

2017-09-24T14:20:04,"Here's my coffee frenzied late night pitch. I'm including a potential cataclysmic spoiler Vinc noticed on Charlie Clouser's twitter which will be color coded to the background, so if you see missing or grayed out text, only highlight it if you're aware of what the spoiler is or don't mind knowing. - Matt Passmore is tested (or intended on being executed) in the laser trap (for reasons I have no idea) when Jigsaw is alive, he blocks the lasers with the handle and somehow survives - Becomes Jigsaw apprentice  - Laura's character hates Passmore, maybe he wronged her and that was the reason he was in the laser trap to begin with, or maybe she hates him because he was able to gather evidence that caused her to be prosecuted for the runaway garbage truck. Passmore's wife is killed in the runaway garbage truck accident which the barn group are responsible for, with Laura playing the biggest part in the accident, Clouser's twitter confirms that ""you killed my wife"" is spoken during the Hello Zepp music - Years later, Passmore puts Laura in the barn game (maybe he poses as buckethead for reasons I cant concoct) - Everyone dies except for Laura - Laura is last one alive, Passmore conceals his identity with the pig mask and sets up the shotgun in front of her - Passmore plays a tape which tells her that his investigation will lead him there, she can get revenge by allowing the shotgun to kill him if she wishes and the option to shackle herself to a pipe will allow her to be free of suspicion, alternatively she could pass on her opportunity for revenge by disarming the shotgun and simply leaving - Meanwhile the redhead partnered with Passmore's investigation is Laura's sister - Throughout the movie Passmore's investigation has been playing out alongside the barn game but when he reaches the barn with the redhead it becomes clear the barn game has happened about 12 or 24 hours ago - Passmore goads the redhead into entering the shotgun room first and Laura's desire for revenge takes the life of her sister - This is the point where we reveal to the audience Passmore is the copycat and the game is his revenge against Laura for killing his wife with the runaway garbage truck - She's shackled and he leaves her to die like Adam in the bathroom  The laser trap would not be shown until the end of the film, because we've all seen the trailer and would not expect Passmore to be the copycat because we've seen him in the laser trap in the trailer.  - I excerpt from sawfreaks.com -",0,0,√áƒ±raks TV,vPP6aIw1vgY,-0.028571428571428574,2017-09-24 14:20:04,True,True

2017-10-05T15:26:08,"Well, as a huge Saw fan having watched all of the franchise, I have to say that this one looks absolutely garbage to me, and I'm quite disappointed (I might be wrong, the movie itself could be quite good as well). I mean, in the trailer, the first trap was basically people being pulled by chains and having buckets on their heads while being pulled into ripper blades. Well typically, all you have to do is use the blades to cut off the chains, and after all, you can still see because the buckets have holes in them. C'mon, bring back some of the inescapable traps, my personal favorite would definitely be the angel trap from Saw III. Don't get me wrong, I love all of the Saw movies, but Jigsaw just doesn't feel as appealing as the others in the franchise. Although, it is a relief to see John Crammer back at it, hadn't seen him in FOREVER since Saw 5. Idk, but I'm just not as hyped for the release of Jigsaw.

Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.     - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.     What's the difference?     You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you'll just work us to death?     We'll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that?     One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.     I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We're bees.     We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I've never seen them this close.     They know what it's like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don't come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!     - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.     Their day's not planned.     Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.     You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.     Right.     Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.     It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.     Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.     Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?     Distant. Distant.     Look at these two.     - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.     It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.     Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!     He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!     - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.     What were you doing during this?     Trying to alert the authorities.     I can autograph that.     A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?     Yeah. Gusty.     We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.     - Six miles, huh? - Barry!     A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.     - Maybe I am. - You are not!     We're going 0900 at J-Gate.     What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?     I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.     Hey, Honex!     Dad, you surprised me.     You decide what you're interested in?     - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.     Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?     Son, let me tell you about stirring.     You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.     You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.     You know, Dad, the more I think about it,     maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.     You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?     That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.     Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!     - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.     You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!     - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!     Wait till you see the sticks I have.     I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!     Let's open some honey and celebrate!     Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.     Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!     I'm so proud.     - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.     Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.     Yeah, right.     Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...     - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!     One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.     - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!     Wow!     Oouple of newbies?     Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!     Make your choice.     - You want to go first? - No, you go.     Oh, my. What's available?     Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.     - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.     I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.     Wax monkey's always open.     The Krelman opened up again.     What happened?     A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.     Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!     Oh, this is so hard!     Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,     humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,     mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?     Barry!     All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...     What happened to you? Where are you?     - I'm going out. - Out? Out where?     - Out there. - Oh, no!     I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.     You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?     Another call coming in.     If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd     that gets their roses today.     Hey, guys.     - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?     Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.     It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.     Really? Feeling lucky, are you?     Sign here, here. Just initial that.     - Thank you. - OK.     You got a rain advisory today,     and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.     So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,     hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.     Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.     Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!     - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies,     bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!     All right, launch positions!     Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!",0,0,oliver batson,vPP6aIw1vgY,0.13742491335102014,2017-10-12 04:18:44,True,True

A voice is telling me that I am being punished for what I've done. For all the sins I've committed, For all the wrong-doing I've performed. Here I am; He is testing me.  I have two choices to make; But the choices are hard to decide: Should I sacrifice? Or Should I die?  Sacrifice, I will pass and win And escape the trap. But the painful agony will persist And I will lose something part of me Or I will lose someone dear to me.  Die, I will fail and lose And stay in the trap. But the test is too complex to fight, Painful agony is just too much. I'll die with a gruesome, morbid death.  He is watching me, Time is running out. Face my punishments, Solve the deadly puzzles. Accept the torture, accept the fate.  Live or Die... The test will haunt me for eternity. Live or Die... The test will be my grave. Live or Die... I cannot choose.

When I watched the trailer for Jigsaw I was kind of excited for the return of our resident engineering maniac John Kramer but because it's has been seven years since the last Saw movie I had forgotten my thoughts at the end of the last film and that was why make more ? Having seen this, those are still my thoughts.  This is the 8th film of the Saw franchise and sadistic serial killer Jigsaw is back to his old tricks, despite his apparent death a decade earlier. As his new victims fight to survive his twisted games, the police must solve Jigsaw's strange clues and deal with the improbability of his return .   There have been eight Harry Potter movies and there are eight Saw movies and I've seen none of the former and all of the latter. That says more about me than anything else.  This is not the worst of the Saw films but that's damning it with faint praise. There is absolutely nothing new to see here which might please ardent fans but I struggled with it at times. It's only ninety minutes long yet it still felt too long. It's not scary but it makes up for it with the gore and they way they got around the fact that John Kramer was already dead was very clever. Hopefully that's the end of his story now but I somehow doubt it very much. 5 out of 10",0,0,redvalleyjohn,vPP6aIw1vgY,0.04534792368125702,2018-01-21 19:27:02,False,True

Because they straight up recycled the twist from the second film. I'm not even going to say ""In the writer's defence it was the only way they could bring Jigsaw back."" Because if they wanted to do that so badly all they really had to do was set the film at some vague date between the beginning and end of Jigsaw's career that hadn't yet been covered.     Another thing that annoyed me was that allegedly the differences between Jigsaw and his various disciples is that while his disciples usually just make deaf traps. Jigsaw's games can be beaten. Jigsaw doesn't put people in a situation where if they do everything right they will still die because beating the test is in fact the point. However did the one legged man who was left to starve to death die due to any fault of his own? Even in this very same film Jigsaw rescue someone because they didn't failed the test due to any fault of their own. This doesn't just occur in a Saw film. This occurs in the very same Saw film. It just comes across as inconsistent.
