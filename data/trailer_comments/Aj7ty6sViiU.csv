2015-12-10T03:48:29,"Hmmm.... Okay, so I gotta admit, this is the first time I've seen anything of Tarzan that may even be remotely good. Maybe. One concern I had was how the apes looked, the cgi for them doesn't look up to scratch, especially for a movie that's coming out in 2016. My only guess is is that the movie itself has not finished shooting and these bits were the only ones they touched up to release as a teaser, so hopefully there will be a lot more work put into making them look photorealistic, technically the cgi in this movie should look better than the planet of the apes movies. I'm also glad they didn't try to drag Tarzan into the future and have him live in New York or something as I've always hated that about Tarzan movies. I like Margot Robbie, but can't really see her as Jane, she seems miscast in my opinion. Hopefully this could be the Tarzan movie to stand alongside the Disney movie, perhaps even surpass it...

2015-12-11T01:23:03,"To everyone making references about ""this better not ruin my childhood"": Tarzan was a series of novels (well-written in my opinion) that were very gruesome at times. The story is remarkable but it was never meant to be a story for kids. Disney softened the Tarzan story by A LOT. This looks like it doesn't even want to follow the original story (which I'm ok with, movies are made for different perspectives most of the time). It looks like they just want to make an epic action adventure thing with the story of Tarzan and make it their own. The original story of Tarzan is pretty neat and I'm sorry that it won't be translated in this film. Instead it feels like the jungle meets the avengers, typical Hollywood over-the-top effects with a mediocre story. I'm open minded and I will go see this.

Despite its dark moments, Disney's Tarzan was still a very upbeat movie. This seems to be going more gritty, more adult-oriented. So it shouldn't be a surprise that the musical aspect is gone. That would be like if Christian Bale played batman in the Dark Knight Rises, but still made jokes like those of Adam West's Batman from the 60s. That being said, I was somewhat confused by the casting choices for some of the roles.

2015-12-11T23:13:51,"Indeed I have to agree with some of you who commented that most people seem to know only the Disney movie. Anyone who read the original story would tell you that the Disney version of Tarzan (as a character) had very little to do with what's in the original book. The book depicts a very sad and essentially a very lonely existence that is filled with plenty of violence that he both received and handed out. Plain and simple, Tarzan in the book becomes a killer. He kills for survival, he kills for revenge and he kills for pleasure. I don't think that the things that are in the book would ever make it to the big screen but I would still watch it just to see how close did they dare to get to the original story.",1,0,Snd Lugo,Aj7ty6sViiU,0.06558035714285715,2015-12-11 23:13:51,True,True

2015-12-13T06:20:12,"All I can say is that this trailer was fantastic, it was visually beautiful, the landscape looked spectacular, definitely the cinematography will be the strongest part of this movie, because I've watched this trailer too many times just admiring the visuals of it, and also the actors, Margot Robbie looks beautiful as Jane Porter, always lovely to watch, Christoph Waltz as the villain, well I'm not sure about that, I'm sure that he is a great actor, but I'm not sure to see him as the villain, and Alexander Skarsgard as the titular character seems fine to me, although I'm pretty sure his fanclub will get more ladies after his portrayal, and Samuel L. Jackson, can't forget about Samuel L. Jackson seeing how he fits inside this cast, so good!     But anyways, this movie is not related to the Disney animated movie, this character has existed for almost 100 years since Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote his first of twelve novels of the character which became popular and even before Disney made the animated movie, it will be based off stories from the original books, but not the Disney movie, as for David Yates as the director, I congratulate him, because seeing the fantastic job he did on Harry Potter makes me want to know more about his director skills, my favorite part was at the end when Tarzan was drinking the coffee, acting natural even though many of the men in the office knew who he was, and the cut!, the final cut of the trailer where Tarzan and the chief Ape get ready to fight, Legendary!!",2,0,Manuel David Rendon Acevedo,Aj7ty6sViiU,0.3897222222222222,2015-12-13 06:20:12,True,True

2015-12-30T17:00:47,i was onboard with the movie until i saw two completely unrealistic things. 1. humans cant swing from vines like that.  not for long anyways. and especially not after jumping from like 50 feet up onto a slippery vine below. half of which would probably break under the strain of a 180 pound man falling at 32 feet per second per second.  and 2. A HUMAN CANNOT FIGHT AN ADULT MALE GORILLA  much less win the fight. a male gorilla can be anywhere from 6 to 15 times stronger than your average human male. now tarzan is obviously stronger than your average human male given his physique but he is nowhere near the strength of the gorillas hes fighting. and no amount of fighting technique would be able to compensate for the sheer strength those animals posses.  so hes not going to be able to use any join locks or throws on them. having him win a fight against them would make tarzan super human.,0,0,D.

The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.  Revelation 20:14-15 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. THIS IS THE SECOND DEATH.  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.  DOES ANYONE MEASURE UP TO GOD'S STANDARD?  Romans 3:23 For ALL have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.  HOW CAN WE BE SAVED?  John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever BELIEVETH in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt BELIEVE in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Romans 10:10 For with the heart man BELIEVETH unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  WHAT EXACTLY DID HE DO TO SAVE US?  1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ DIED FOR OUR SINS according to the scriptures; And that he WAS BURIED, and that he ROSE AGAIN THE THIRD DAY according to the scriptures:  1 Peter 3:18 For Christ also hath once SUFFERED FOR SINS, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:  HOW ARE WE CLEANED FROM SIN?  Hebrews 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged WITH BLOOD; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  Colossians 1:20 And, having made peace through THE BLOOD of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.  IS IT FREE OR DO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING FOR IT?  Ephesians 2:9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that NOT OF YOURSELF: it is the GIFT OF GOD:Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the GIFT OF GOD is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  CAN YOU BE CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE SAVED?   I John 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; THAT YE MAY KNOW that ye have eternal life, and that ye may BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God.  HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?  John 6:47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath EVERLASTING life.  ARE YOU PROTECTED AGAINST LOSING YOUR SALVATION?  Ephesians 4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby YE ARE SEALED unto the day of redemption.  Jude 1:1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and PRESERVED in Jesus Christ, and called:  CALL ON HIS NAME!  Psalms 116:13  I will take the cup of salvation, and CALL UPON THE NAME OF LORD.   Romans 10:13  For whosoever shall CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD shall be saved.  Pray: LORD I believe I am a sinner. I know I deserve to go to hell. I believe you are the Son of God, and through your shed blood on the cross I have forgiveness of sins, and by your resurrection I am justified.

2016-03-14T13:46:09,"Seriously, what's with the stupid human tribe in the jungle? Was that in the book or something? If so, that's one thing the Disney film did way better than the book. I thought the point was that Tarzan was in an extremely remote area of the world and didn't even know there were others of his species, let alone saw one. It made his identity crisis all the more compelling. Also, Christoph Waltz if probably my favourite actor, but they are going to keep his character German, right? Because there's no way anyone will believe he is an old British hunter. And any sense of gritty realism flew out the window when they put Samuel L Jackson in a room full of old, British, mutton chop-wearing white men in Victorian London who accept him as one of them.

2016-05-20T12:31:47,i think the trailer looks great and i'm hoping more than anyone that this movie turns out so. but something that kind of bothers me is how i think Hollywood found its new movie gimmick and that is to make dark more serious movies. dark movies are great when done right like with batman in the dark knight and the new bond movies. but batman is supposed to be dark. that is the theme. did we really need a dark superman movie like man of steel? but it made money so hollywood is convinced its suitable to everything. i liked the movie and i also enjoyed BvS more than others but i just feel like fun movies are good like the jungle book and the marvel movies. i have no problem with serious movies when done right and i just hope this tarzan movie wont get too serious and still have some fun because its tarzan and not batman of the jungle. this is still just my personal opinion of corse.,2,5,god,Aj7ty6sViiU,0.22862137862137863,2016-05-20 12:31:47,True,True

2016-07-10T02:31:31,"Big Tarzan fan here. I read the novel a few times, loved ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan"" (the definitive Tarzan flick for me) and even dug the Johnny Weissmuller movies as a kid, but man, the new movie... meh.The new ""The Legend of Tarzan"" (not to be confused with the Greystoke movie) is just not that great. The True Blood guy is great in the roll of Tarzan. He's a good actor anyway. But Samuel L. Jackson in a Tarzan movie... really? Seems he can play ONE character and just doesn't seem to have the acting chops to not be the ""Pulp Fiction guy"" in every movie. When you have a movie that's taking place in the 1800s, it's kind of stupid for one of the characters to play it like it's the modern day. The movie had potential but his character just was completely unnecessary, unfunny, and distracting. It's like movie studios think ""We need to have a guy to say funny things to keep people's attention. We need to give him a 'catch phrase'. Have him say 'Do you want me to kiss this gorilla's nuts?' people will love that!"".  The movie's decent but don't believe the hype. It's not all that the marketing would have you believe. It's a rental. The cgi was kind of quirky as well. Too bad, I thought it was going to be way good. By the way, movie studios constantly wring their hands ""Darnit, why aren't people going to the movies anymore??"" $22 to get in (on a matinee) and $13 for a small soda and small popcorn (?!?!).

2016-08-03T15:30:50,this movie is way too long and drawn out.if it was only half an hour long it would have been half good.the acting was off.allot of the action scenes are so off . its like they did not even try to make it look real. the high cliff jumps into the forests is so out of touch it rather belongs in chinese martial arts floating movie.when they reunited to the tribes they were laughing and embracing . i would say that tribesmen even today don't greet like that its only a  western thing. and tarzan expressed disinterest and was put of at the idea of returning to congo the home of his youth which completely depletes all the romantic feelings associated with growing up in the feral wild connected to the purity of nature free of society's rigidity. i would connect his return to some longing for his past instead of an invitation of the king.if you grow up jumping around in the forest you cant just move out and fit into the confines of society,0,0,critical thinking,Aj7ty6sViiU,0.040877192982456144,2016-08-03 15:30:50,False,True

The director really try to get deep into our feelings with the connection between tarzan and the animals, between tarzan and jane and so on.. But it fails, something is missing. It just feels fake and superficial.  What do i mean with fake? i Mean tarzan is shaved but you can see he can grow a lot of beard. Most of the people barely sweat, everybody seems so clean even though they are in the jungle. Tarzan is jumping like he is superman(too much effect/bad effect), it just feels like this was made for children... Most of the actors didnt fit in this movie, they should have used other actors like christian bale or more original persons..., All in all what can you expect from a director who can't see tarzan like the way we did in our young days...
