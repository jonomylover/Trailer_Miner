Posh people who sip tea and own race horses drive those cars. Street racing is about back alley gambling on cars and doing your own modifications with the money you earned from street racing and not the money you got off of your grandfather when he passed away. What happened to Japanese imports? These new street racing movies all seem to be about showing off the movie budget by using all these cars and making them explode. They've become more about action and special effects than actual street racing.
