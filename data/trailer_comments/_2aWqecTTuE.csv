Who knows, they might explain the historical accuracies as for the people who made this ARE professionals.  I liked how they captured the demonic side of Vampires, instead of trying to make them sexy, vampires in general are meant to be fowl, demonic creatures. Sure, maybe some sensuality was shown, but overall I thought they were accurate with the following things:  1. Dracula was a real guy, no arguing about that obviously  2. Dracula's superior power to other vampires, making him different from any other vampire  3. The dark, gritty, hellish side of vampires in general, instead of that sexy bullshit. -pardon my language-  4. I love how they portrayed his backstory, I mean a good man who would do anything to protect his family but eventually become an evil legend. Better than modern day vampiric sexuality  5. Sure, I get we got some critics out there who think this is some ridiculous trash covered with special effects, but who knows- it might do well.  6.

Its going to be the same thing with the new TMNT movie; It involves everyone's favorite fandom or favorite character so most of them will go anyway.

Most of the people here have never read Bram Stoker's Dracula... even a lot of the ones who say they have. Dracula has no ""real"" origin story, so stop saying he does and that this movie is going to contradict it.  2. A lot of people think this movie is going to glorify ""evil"" as being ""good,"" without considering that this film may be showing a hero's fall from good to evil, or maybe showing that the binary of good and evil doesn't exist, and everything is shades of gray. You know, like real life.  3. Everyone thinks Dracula is the ""first"" vampire, which means there couldn't possibly be any other vampires that came before him. Again, read the book, guys. Also, if any literary vampire should be considered the ""first"" modern vampire, it should be Lord Ruthven from John Polidori's ""The Vampyre,"" as he is most likely the progenitor of the modern vampire myth.  4. A lot of people are mad that the film isn't historically accurate to Vlad Tepes. A lot of the people leaving comments about Vlad Tepes are actually citing false information. Also, they seem to forget that this is a fictional film, not a documentary. Vlad Tepes wasn't actually a vampire, guys.  5. Most of the people who want to see this are Castlevania fans.

2014-07-02T08:14:47,"This is based on the fictional vampire Dracula, not the historical figure, damn people, cool your jets. Yes, Stoker based his character on the historical figure but the title says Dracula, Untold... there is no tagline based on a true story there at all. It's fantasy so cut them some freaking slack. Being a big horror buff this actually looks much more interesting and well thought out/produced than most renditions of Dracula. If you have a complaint about the sort of vampirism do your research on the mythos.  Many Hollywood and literary sources present vampires as both horrific monsters and romantic tragic figures. This films seems to blend the two quite well if the trailer is any indication. Dracula could turn into bats and rats and bugs and wolves and all kinds of things horrible and fantastic. Sometimes he was striking, beautiful and other times horrific and deformed. If anything this movie is tipping its hat to those aspects of the Dracula mythology.  I didn't hear any crappy cancer voice coming out of his mouth. So Batman has bats... whoopty frigging doo. Guess batman rips off Dracula since the novel came way before the comic. There are no original ideas just really good writers who steal ideas and make you think its something new. There's only so many ways you can spin a dark tragic anti hero and this somewhat gothic style of filming does not originate from the Dark Knight movie. Hollywood uses what works and you know what when someone tries something new  the trolling masses crucify it. I'll give you that sparkling vampires are a pretty stupid idea especially attractive to teenage girls but at least someone had the bravery to try something new. You people aren't satisfied with originality and the saying goes something like mimicry is the greatest form of flattery (yes I know i butchered the phrase but you get the gist) but people complain about that too.  If it peaks your interest see it, if you wanna complain go start a forum. Oh and also the judgmental attitudes of a lot of viewers is quite deplorable. Do you even read or watch history related stuff? Vlad might have been a monster by our standards but if you look at his history and what he was facing you might have a bit more sympathy for the man. He saved his countrymen from slavery and death for a time.  To this day he is still hailed as a hero in that part of the world. I believe he may have gone beyond what was necessary but maybe not. He was ludicrously outnumbered with limited resources and very little support from those who commanded him. The tactics while horrible by our standards got the job done, scared away the Turks and saved his people. I'm sure it was less madness and depravity and instead calculated intelligent maneuvering born more out of desperation and the ends justifies the means mentality. If being victorious means you're right then I suppose Vlad chose the right methods wouldn't you agree?",2,0,Amber Hightower,_2aWqecTTuE,0.0606577134986226,2014-07-02 08:14:47,True,True

His father gave him and his brother to the saltin and through Dracula life he wanted revenge making him go mad with hatred. When he became prince in his kingdom after his father died, he killed his own people in horrific ways when he returned to lay down his law, order and loyalty. Then he went forth on his revenge on the saltin and on all of islam. he burned fields of crops on his own land for the islamic turkey army wont have food to eat coming into his country and piking thousands of bodies to make it look like a forest of the dead, that frighten the turkish military.   Vampire Dracula original story is that he was cursed by god by damning gods name when his Wife died by suicide or in horrific way that brought his madness and evilness to the extreme.  They should of embed this into the story line instead for asking to be cursed by a evil figure on top of a mountain. How did the other guy get the curse? It still looks like a good movie to watch and ive been dying to see a werewolf or a vampire story that goes into depth on how the curse all began in a full movie instead of a small preview in the beginning or close to the end of most movie's.

2014-07-03T16:56:22,"Vlad Țepes: One of the few great rulers of Romania that brought fear into his enemies through some unique strategies of battle.  His most definite mark was that he impaled a huge amount of people with no remorse! Despite what most say, HE DID NOT DO THIS FOR PLEASURE! he was impaling only THIEVES, LIERS and invaders of Wallachia, mostly punishing those that opposed the ways of God. There was no jail time or captures. He executed them on sight, impaling them to set an example.  Because he was so straight with his executions and filled his entire country with impaled bodies terrifying everyone, people started to think that he is evil. Until to the point the story of Dracula started to emerge.  Another reason why he was considered evil was that he impaled even a lot of rich people that tried to betray him. Because of this, those that opposed him tried to make the people hate and fear him by spreading FALSE stories in the hope that his support would diminish and he could be taken down from his throne.  Here are the 2 most infamous strategies that he used to defeat the ottoman empire even if he was greatly outnumbered.  1. He and his men chopped off an entire forest and dressed it as soldiers... When the ottoman soldiers arrived, they retreated frightened of the numbers Vlad armies were posing.  2. 'The night attack'. He and a few men dressed as ottomans went into their enemy camp, starting a riot under the reason ""Get up and fight, Romanians have dressed as ottomans and are sabotaging our camp!"". This way the ottoman forces slaughtered themselves.  After battles, all of the fallen bodies were impaled to set an example.  Make no mistake, the Ottoman forces could have crushed Romanian forces like bugs. The armies used for their campaign were not to conquer, but to recover the tribute Romanians were supposed to give. This means the numbers of soldiers sent to oppose Vlad was fairly low compared with the entire Ottoman armada!  This is a short and very simplified version of the real Dracula history. The legend is nice, but too far from truth. I like that in this movie Vlad is presented as a DEFENDER, ready to sacrifice all that he has for the sake of his family and people. One way or another this is what he actually did, and i hope this movie will resurrect at least the intentions of Vlad.﻿  AND ... DRACU means DEVIL, NOT DRAGON !!!!!!!! Dracul -> The Devil.

It's not even based on the actual Vlad Tepes, but the fictional vampire Dracula (who was based on Vlad Tepes) So in a nutshell, it's making changes to a fictional character who was already only loosely based on a real person who died hundreds of years ago when recorded history was sketchy at best. Are these the same people who complained about 300? Maybe the problem is making Dracula the hero, or anti-hero in this case since people are arguing in the comments whether or not the original Vlad the impaler could be called anything other than a monster. But that's really irrelevant since almost everyone, especially leaders, would be monsters by our modern definitions of morality and equality. How many movies show the founding fathers interacting with their slaves. How many movies show Columbus to be a monster who pillaged the natives land. How many movies show any male from the past absuing women (I suppose shows like Game of Thrones and Spartacus are the best examples) At the end of the day it's a movie. Enjoy it for what it is.

2014-07-15T12:48:41,",,Who was Vlad Dracula?  An Intriguing Figure in The Fifteenth Century  by Benjamin Hugo Leblanc - EPHE-Sorbonne (Paris) &  Laval University (Quebec) Count Dracula is more than 100 years old and still alive! Of course, almost everybody has heard about this Nosferatu: through movies featuring Max Schreck, Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee or Gary Oldman; in several books, including the recent Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice, or even in bedtime stories told to us in our childhood. We all have an idea of who or what the Count is. However, on the other hand, Vlad Tepes (Dracula), the historical figure who inspired Bram Stoker’s novel, is definitely less well-known.  Vlad Tepes was born in December 1431 in the fortress of Sighisoara, Romania. Vlad's father, governor of Transylvania, had been inducted into the Order of the Dragon about one year before. The order — which could be compared to the Knights of the Hospital of St. John or even to the Teutonic Order of Knights — was a semi-military and religious society, originally created in 1387 by the Holy Roman Emperor and his second wife, Barbara Cilli. The main goal of such a secret fraternal order of knights was to protect the interests of Christianity and to crusade against the Turks. The boyars of Romania associated the dragon with the Devil and decided to call Vlad's father ""Dracul,"" which in the Romanian language means ""Devil;"" ""Dracula"" is a diminutive, meaning ""the son of the Devil.""   In the winter of 1436-1437, Dracul became prince of Walachia (one of the three Romanian provinces) and took up residence at the palace of Targoviste, the princely capital. Vlad followed his father and lived six years at the princely court. In 1442, in order to keep the Turks at bay, Dracul sent his son, Vlad, and his younger brother, Radu, to Constantinople (today Istanbul) as hostages of the Sultan Murad II. Vlad was held there until 1448. This Turkish captivity surely played an important role in Dracula's upbringing; it must be at this period that he adopted a very pessimistic view of life and learned the Turkish method of impalement on stakes. The Turks set Vlad free after informing him of his father's assassination in 1447. He also learned about his older brother's death and how he had been tortured and buried alive by the boyars of Targoviste.  When he was 17 years old, Vlad Tepes (Dracula), supported by a force of Turkish cavalry and a contingent of troops lent to him by Pasha Mustafa Hassan, made his first major move toward seizing the Walachian throne. Vlad became the ruler of Walachia in July of 1456. During his six-year reign, he committed many cruelties, hence establishing his controversial reputation.  His first major act of revenge was aimed at the boyars of Targoviste for not being loyal to his father. On Easter Sunday of what we believe to be 1459, he arrested all the boyar families who had participated at the princely feast. He impaled the older ones on stakes while forcing the others to march from the capital to the town of Poenari. This fifty-mile trek was quite grueling and no one was permitted to rest until they reached their destination. Dracula then ordered the boyars to build him a fortress on the ruins of an older outpost overlooking the Arges River. Many died in the process. Dracula, therefore, succeeded in creating a new nobility and obtaining a fortress for future emergencies. What is left of the building today is identified as Poenari Fortress (Cetatea Poenari).  Vlad Tepes adopted the method of impaling criminals and enemies and raising them aloft in the town square for all to see. Almost any crime, from lying and stealing to killing, could be punished by impalement. Being so confident in the effectiveness of his law, Dracula placed a golden cup on display in the central square of Targoviste. The cup could be used by thirsty travelers, but had to remain on the square. According to the available historical sources, it was never stolen and remained entirely unmolested throughout Vlad's reign. Crime and corruption ceased; commerce and culture thrived, and many Romanians to this day view Vlad Tepes as a hero for his fierce insistence on honesty and order. It’s worth mentioning that most written sources regarding his reign are based on the numerous propagandistic pamphlets spread by the Germans with the help of their new invention, the printing press.  In the beginning of 1462, Vlad launched a campaign against the Turks along the Danube River. It was quite risky, the military force of Sultan Mehmed II being by far more powerful than the Walachian army. However, during the winter of 1462, Vlad was very successful and managed to gain several victories. To punish Dracula, the Sultan decided to launch a full-scale invasion of Walachia. His other goal was to transform this land into a Turkish province. He entered Walachia with an army three times larger than Dracula's. Finding himself without allies and forced to retreat towards Targoviste, Vlad burned his own villages and poisoned the wells along the way, so that the Turkish army would find nothing to eat or drink. Moreover, when the Sultan, exhausted, finally reached the capital city, he was confronted by a most gruesome sight: hundreds of stakes held the remaining carcasses of Turkish captives, a horror scene which was ultimately nicknamed the ""Forest of the Impaled."" This terror tactic, deliberately stage-managed by Dracula, was definitely successful. The scene had a strong effect on Mehmed's most stout-hearted officers, and the Sultan, tired and hungry, decided to withdraw (it is worth mentioning that even Victor Hugo, in his Legende des Siecles, recalls this particular incident). Nevertheless, following his retreat from Walachian territory, Mehmed encouraged and supported Vlad's younger brother, Radu, to take the Walachian throne. At the head of a Turkish army and joined by Vlad's detractors, Radu pursued his brother to Poenari Castle on the Arges River. According to legend, this is when Dracula's wife, in order to escape capture, committed suicide by hurling herself from the upper battlements, her body falling down the precipice into the river below, a scene exploited by Francis Ford Coppola's production. Vlad, who was definitely not the kind of man to kill himself, managed to escape the siege of his fortress by using a secret passage into the mountain. He was, however, assassinated toward the end of December 1476.  The only real link between the historical Dracula (1431-1476) and the modern literary myth of the vampire is the 1897 novel. Bram Stoker built his fictional character solely based on the research that he conducted in libraries in London. Political detractors and Saxon merchants, unhappy with the new trade regulations imposed by Vlad, did everything they could to blacken his reputation. They produced and disseminated throughout Western Europe exaggerated stories and illustrations about Vlad's cruelty. Vlad Tepes' reign was, however, presented in a different way in chronicles written in other parts of Europe.

2014-07-31T00:31:53,"This film is loosely based on the 13th Century Hungarian prince named Vlad III Tepes, also known as Vlad The Impaler. It also includes aspects of the fictional character Dracula, which was based on Vlad. The story of Dracula was based on the excessive cruelty Vlad displayed to his enemies and, as the name suggests, was known for impaling them. His father was Vlad II Dracul, from which the name Dracula was conceived, and which was also the name which Vlad III carried forth with slight variation.  His father was also a member of the the group known as Order of the Dragon, which was formed to protect Christianity in the area. This is also displayed in the trailer from the armour worn by the lead which incorporates a dragon design.  In terms of the conflict shown in the trailer, during the mid 13th century Vlad III had conflict with the Ottoman dynasty. This stemmed from an order given by the Ottoman leader, known as Mehmet, to offer a large tax contributing of both money and men, similarly shown in this trailer. Vlad III however refused due to believing that paying such a tax would symbolise the surrender of his land and people to the Ottomans as he solely believed in the freedom and interdependency of his  land and people.  However unlike the trailer suggests Vlad III did not climb a mountain and ask the help of a mysterious old man in order to become a vampire. He was however one of the first members of the The League of Shadows.",199,93,Ra's al Ghul,_2aWqecTTuE,-0.003878859236002095,2014-07-31 00:31:53,True,True

Now we want a percent of the  gross, and ancilliary rights.   Now a Palestinian watching this in a movie theatre might think, Well, every Christian I meet says, Our God hates you, devil-spawn,.. To me, they say this. Now, obviously this movie is saying, Do not call upon the God of Israel for deliverance, for He will not hear you, but there must be a way to save your people. So, Dracul, go find The Evil Sorcerer - perhaps he can help you find justice, if not peace, for  a price. .. Wow, I have so little to live for, or to look forward to - perhaps I should blow up this  movie theatre, Quentin Tarantino style? But that would only reinforce stereotypes. The Engry Areb.   .. Meanwhile, a Jew, perhaps sitting in the very same movie theatre, laughs, and says to his friend, Avi, ""Those  Marxists!!... Have you seen such clever writing! .. The man in the Red Cape, is obviously Netanihayu, and being concerned for the safety of his people, goes to Washington, to visit President Obama, that anemic gentile. There he brokers a deal - with undisclosed terms - for an Iron Dome technology. And now the people ask - What did you promise him in return? Behold, he begins to behave more and more like an American politician, catering to many constituents, rather than to one, namely, us. Are we now to accept peace at the price of assimilation - Into what, global capitalism? .. You have to admit, this allegory is very current. How did they manage to time its release so well?"" But his friend Avi is thinking, My friend must be  some kind of movie genius. For all I see is an  attempt to remake Batman Begins on a much lower  budget without infringing upon copyright laws.

2014-08-18T04:33:26,"Let's have this more clear, the first vampire was a human man named Ambrogio. He was an Italian-born adventurer who fate brought to Delphi, in Greece. But in a nutshell a series of blessings and curses transformed this young man into history's first vampire. Specifically, it began with the sun god Apollo (Greek mythology), who in a fit of rage cursed Ambrogio so that his skin would burn should it ever touch sunlight again. Ambrogio's bad luck followed when he ended up gambling away his soul to Hades (Greek mythology), the god of the underworld. The next curse came via Apollo's sister Artemis (Greek mythology), the goddess of the moon and hunting, who made it so that Ambrogio's skin would burn if he touched silver. The blessings came soon after when Artemis, taking pity on the poor young man, gave him the gift of immortality. He would carry his curses - his skin burning by sunlight or silver, but he would live forever in his current form. Not only that, but Artemis also gave him the speed and strength to become a hunter whose skills were second only to her own. Blood-sucking (which, by the way, is called ""hematophagy"" in case you were curious) is also included in this ""blessing"". Ambrogio hunts swans and uses their blood as ink to write love poems to his lady Selene. While this may be considered a little creepy by our standards, it wasn't all that unusual in ancient Greece to make do with what you hunted.  Ambrogio later moved back to Italy, now as a full-fledged vampire. Legend traces him to the city of Florence (Firenze), where he creates the first Vampire Clan. We don't know a whole lot about this clan, other than they were most likely willing volunteers - humans who wanted power and immortality, and were willing to trade their souls for it. It was believed that the curse would continue for any vampire where their souls would remain in the Underworld (aka Hades aka Hell), where they could return to claim them, but then could never leave. From what we know of the history of vampires, the clan grew in size and strength, until infighting created something of a ""civil war"" within the clan, and many vampires left to form their own clans. What happened to Ambrogio and those who stayed with him is largely unknown, though many believe that he still resides somewhere in Florence.",3,3,R3fur,_2aWqecTTuE,0.11155764966740578,2014-08-18 04:33:26,True,True

2014-09-15T22:25:30,"What a bunch of bullshit. Packaging it as if it's the ""untold"" true story of Dracula but then showing him turning into bats which is complete Hollywood fictionalized bullshit. I'd love to see JUST ONE writer actually research the real Vlad Dracula; do the damn fact checking and get it right, instead of making up more bullshit and packaging it as non-fiction. I've read every damn book that's ever been written on the real Vlad Dracula and he didn't fucking turn into a swarm of bats. If this movie IS based on the true facts then I think it's a brilliant idea. But based on the word ""Untold"" in the title and the trailer showing him turning into a swarm of bats it looks more like a bait & switch - trying to sucker people into theaters by making them believe it's non-fiction and only revealing the truth after they've made their money. How the hell is it ""Untold"" if it's based on the novel Dracula by Irish novelist Bram Stoker? (a story that has already been told LITERALLY 217 times as of 2009).  It's no different than the way they released the book ""The Celestine Prophecy"", originally marketed as non-fiction and then LATER they admitted that it was complete fiction. The ""Celestine Prophecy"" was a great book; it's still one of my favorites - but still deceptive in the way it was marketed. Same with ""Paranormal Activity"" and the ""Blair Witch Project"".

2014-09-30T23:11:22,"For the record, I'm looking forward to this movie.  The problems with many movies these days seems to be more that they are (sadly rightfully so) geared to a less intelligent audience. Many people don't care about the ideals associated with sacrificing oneself for an eternity of hell in a living body. Half of them don't care about ideals at all. Probably why a good amount of the critics said Cloud Atlas was too advanced for most of the viewers. It's probably also why you'll find Star Wars to be a hot topic while Dune and Star Trek are almost ignored. This is mainly due to education itself being undermined and consequently not funded.  Most viewers I've talked to want less reason for a story, more action in the story, and great graphical and sound effects. (don't deny it, almost ALL of the top twenty comments as of posting this talk about shitty effects, even the ones that dislike twilight admit that it's because someone DARED to present vampires as capable of being attractive and good[though yes, pouring sparkles on them was a bit much])  This is why you'll often find viewers who love mainly comedy, horror, action, or psychological thrillers (a fancy name for horror of which its type has been defined multiple ways). They don't truly want to be engaged in the movie. They don't want something to think about and relate to reality. They just want straight entertainment ***(or as I call it when I'm in a rage 'stupid pointless bullshit that encourages people to become even dumber than they were when they began watching it').***  For the people who recognize that and use it to relax, you're fine. For the others? You're fine too. I'm not actually trying to insult you guys though it may sound like it. But different movies appeal to different people. I don't care if the movie/show doesn't have the best effects or the most action. I don't care if the battles are mainly won through talking. I want something to be able to think about and enjoy doing so. I want to walk away from a movie and learn something new... even if solely from a fantasy ideal  ***emphasis on ""when I'm in a rage""***",0,0,Liam Holly,_2aWqecTTuE,0.263956228956229,2014-09-30 23:11:22,True,True

Mircai was a child, and ottomans dos not kill children and massacre the people, instead they protect them and share their knowledge and treat them as their own. So when Mircai  grew older he became a soldier in the army, then a general. Fatih gave him the job to ""manage"" Romania. For a long time no taxes were coming from Mircais area, so Fatih sent some soldiers to check the thing, but Soon after they came he impaled all the soldiers and drank their blood, except 2. He told them to report this to Fatih, and they did. Fatih personally selected a group of huge army and sent them to kill Mircai. And yes, he had a castle, scary as shit we see in movies. After Mircais wife saw the army's size she jumped out of the window to the cliff and killed herself.

I mean obviously this movie has elements and ties to the real man Vlad but it's the origin story of Vlad Dracula the fictional character not the real historical figure man. So whats all this talk about how awful the movie is just because it's not 100 percent historically accurate? If somebody would rather see something about the man himself then try the Discovery Channel or maybe looking it up online. But don't come on here with your bitter cynical remarks and start attacking the people that not only get pissed off by the attitude but really enjoyed the movie. If somebody has an opinion that there should be a movie more centered on Vlad the Impeller thats fine but it's not ok to not only talk poorly about the movie but act as though this opinion of yours is somehow fact. This movie was a great movie and just because somebody thinks there idea is better doesn't make this a bad movie nor does it make what they say fact. Keep such bitter and cynical comments to yourself people. Or at least have the decency to respect others who really enjoyed the film and don't leave such comments please.

2014-10-21T10:48:57,"Why the movie is so bad? Let me explain you! 1- Scenario Mistakes! I watch movie to learn about the beginning of the vampire world and their ""chief"" Dracula. But in movie we can realize that Dracula is not first! Who was the first? What is his story? Also related to Turkish people, who conquered some part of christian world and never push to change their language or religion like other Emparialist states (I think you dont need examples which states I mean!....)?!!! 2- Movie show us that Vlad sold his soul to evil couse of Evil Turks... Turks was coming and killing so he need to.! As movie tells us also, 1st vampire gives a big ""historal lesson"" to Romanian Prince Vlad!!! He tolds to him like.. ""you and your father also killed so many innocent people, what you feel while you was...."" and he answers ""nothing""! So I think there are mistakes in being ""evil""... 3- Also in movie they show us Vlad was educated with Fatih Sultan Mehmet. That is why they call eachother as ""brother"". Because when Mehmet's father Murat II conquered Wallachia, he took Vlad with himself. And Turkish Sultan educated him, give him a courage and make him a prince to Wallachia. So it means that there is nothing to give Vlad's son to Ottomans also!! But he burns his own people, and kills his wife (ofcourse he didnt planned such a result) couse of his son... 4- Stupid one- Dracula can fly as a bat but when his wife is falling he is also falling!! Flying objects can be faster than falling objects on air (if falling one is not 500 kg or smthg) 4- There are many mistakes on historical process. If you want to make a fantacy about real characters you should respect the historical characters. Sultan Mehmet didn't killed in war arena... He won all wars which he controlled.... Hollywood dissapointed me...  They really think that with effect technology they can make people love their stupid scenarios. But what makes movie as a movie is 1stly ""Scenarios""...

2014-11-04T21:03:48,"Somehow I thought of this as the concept of Illuminati--world leaders selling their souls to evil forces to find success and to rule the world. Idk what kind of logic these people follow.  This movie sends the message that sometimes, we just have to submit ourselves to evil forces in order to maintain ""good"". Why do people keep finding pit holes to logic their way into making evil the new good? Why can't everyone just accept the cliche fact that there is a God out there who is in control of everything and whom we should submit to and ask for help in our despair?  God created everything and by everything, that includes satan and evil as a whole. Then what is the purpose of our existence? This life is a test on which choice we make between good and evil. After the test, there's the reward and the punishment. Kinda like the life after graduation: we face the reward of our hard work and the punishment of our luxury. ",0,0,Noreen Taggers,_2aWqecTTuE,-0.1504079254079254,2014-11-04 21:03:48,False,True

Above, as Pontius Pilate, below as a Roman proconsul After Vlad's death, his deeds were reported in popular pamphlets in Germany, reprinted from the 1480s until the 1560s, and to a lesser extent in Tsarist Russia. A typical German pamphlet from 1521 gives numerous examples of lurid incidents, such as the following:[16] He roasted children, whom he fed to their mothers. And (he) cut off the breasts of women, and forced their husbands to eat them. After that, he had them all impaled.[16] Vlad Ţepeş's reputation was considerably darker in Western Europe than in Eastern Europe and Romania. In the West, Vlad III Ţepeş has been characterized as a tyrant who took sadistic pleasure in torturing and killing his enemies.[citation needed] Estimates of the number of his victims range from 40,000 to 100,000.[17] He also had whole villages and fortresses destroyed and burned to the ground.[18] Impalement was Vlad's preferred method of torture and execution. Several woodcuts from German pamphlets of the late 15th and early 16th centuries show Vlad feasting in a forest of stakes and their grisly burdens outside Brașov, while a nearby executioner cuts apart other victims.[19] It has also been said that in 1462 Mehmed II, the conqueror of Constantinople, returned to Constantinople after being sickened by the sight of 20,000 impaled corpses outside Vlad's capital of Târgoviște.[20]",0,0,Dean,_2aWqecTTuE,0.0057017543859649135,2014-11-09 16:37:17,False,True

I believe they owe an apology to Turkish people for telling lies to whole world about Ottoman Empire..Because in real history Ottoman Empire never treated the local people where they conquered badly and also granted them to live their normal life freely. ,29,45,Alper Tunga,_2aWqecTTuE,-0.11643356643356648,2014-11-11 13:06:26,False,True

2015-01-26T07:13:11,"1456 yılında Fâtih, Wlad'i Eflâk prensligine tayin etmişti. Wlad, kardesi Radul ile birlikte Osmanlı sarayında rehine olarak bulunmuştu. Hüküm sürdüğü memlekete Fâtih'in yardımı ile sahip olmasına ve Pâdişaha karşı dost kalacağına dair yemin etmiş bulunmasına rağmen Wlad, sözünde durmayarak Osmanlılar aleyhine Macarlarla anlasma yapacaktır.Fâtih'in, Karadeniz ve Trabzon'da bulundugu sıralarda, Eflâk'ta bazı hadiseler olmaktaydı. Burada Türklerin ""Kazıklı Voyvoda"", Macarlarin ""Drakula"" (Şeytan), Ulahların ""Çepelpuç"" (Cellad) dedikleri Wlad adında zulüm delisi bir adam, halka idarenin en korkuncunu tattırmaktadır. Bu çılgın adam, vahşi ve insanlık dışı birtakım zevklere sahipti. O, kazıklara vurulmuş ve işkence içinde can vermekte olan Türklerin meydana getirdigi büyük halkanın ortasında, saray halkı ile birlikte yemek yemekten zevk alırdı. Eline Türk esirleri geçince ayaklarındaki derinin yüzülmesini ve meydana çıkan kırmızı etlere tuz ekilmesini, sonra da bunları keçilere yalatmasını emrederdi. Böylece, diri diri ayaklarının derisi yüzülen esirlerin işkencesi, daha büyük olurdu. O, kendisine gönderilen Osmanlı elçilerinin sarıklarını başlarına çiviletmiştir. Fâtih Sultan Mehmed, onu İstanbul'a davet eder. Ancak Wlad, düşmanlarının çokluğundan ve memlekette bulunmadığı bir sırada tac ve tahtının Macarlara verileceğinden korktuğundan, Eflâk'ı düşmanlarına karşı muhafaza edecek bir kuvvetin gönderilmesini rica eder. Bunun üzerine Pâdişah, Silistre Beyi Yunus Bey ile Çakırcıbaşı Hamza Bey'i Eflâk'i beklemek üzere görevlendirir. Yunus Bey ile ÇakırcIbaşı Hamza Bey, Tuna kenarına geldikleri vakit, nehrin donmuş olduğunu görürler. Bununla beraber Tuna'yı geçmek hazırlıkları yaptıkları ve dostluktan başka bir şey ümid etmedikleri, hatta itibar göreceklerini sandıkları bir sırada Wlad'ın büyük bir saldırısına uğrarlar. Bu baskında Yunus Bey şehid, Hamza Bey de esir edilmişti. Wlad, daha sonra Hamza Bey'i öldürerek başını Macar kralına gönderir. Kan dökücü Wlad, aldığı esirlerin tamamını kazığa vurduktan sonra, Osmanlılara ait bazı sehir ve kasabaları tahrip etmekten de çekinmez.Bütün bu olanları haber alan Fâtih Sultan Mehmed, hiddetinden ve üzüntüsünden yerinde duramayarak 150 bin kişilik bir ordu ve 25 büyük, 150 küçük parça deniz kuvveti (nehir donanması) hazırlayarak, Allah'ın kullarına zulm eden bu zâlimi ortadan kaldırmak için Eflâk seferine çıkar (H. 866/1462 M.) Fâtih, Eflâk ortalarına kadar gittiği halde, Wlad'in kuvvetleri ortalarda görünmüyorlardı. Wlad, Fâtih'in, casusları vasıtasiyle önceden haber aldığı bir gece baskını düzenleyerek Pâdişahı öldürmek ister. Fakat bunda muvaffak olamadığı gibi, perişan bir halde canını zor kurtarıp kaçabilir. Osmanlı akıncıları onu bulmak için bütün Eflâk’ı tararlar. Pâdişah da ordusuyla prensliğin başkentine yürür. Şehrin yakınında kazıklanmış 15 bin adamdan kurulu korkunç bir orman görünce nefretle ""Devlet kuvvetini böyle kullanmış, tebeasına ve Allah'a karşı bu denlü cinayetler islemiş bir adam, asla itibara layık değildir"" der.Yaralı olarak kaçıp Macarlara sığınan Wlad, onlardan yardım ister. Fakat Macar Kralı, hiç yoktan Osmanlılarla bir anlaşmazlığa düşmek istemediğinden bu yardımı yapmamış, hatta Wlad'i yakalayarak haps etmişti. Öte taraftan Osmanlılar, Wlad'in kardeşi Radul'u oniki bin duka yıllık vergiye bağlayarak Eflâk prensliğinin başına getirdiler. Böylece Eflâk, mümtaz bir eyâlet haline getirilerek, Osmanlılara sıkıca bağlanmış oldu. Wlad, Radul'un ölümü üzerine zindandan kaçıp tekrar idareyi ele almak istediyse de öldürülerek kesik başı memleket memleket dolaştırılır.",0,0,AYDIN CANPOLAT,_2aWqecTTuE,0.0,2015-01-26 07:13:11,False,False

From this movie, it is totally out of the historical accuracy..I agree that this movie is just a fiction movie for entertainment and for money purposes.   But, I am also 100% agree that this is not a way to do so..Most of us learn by exemplary/observational and watch...Twisting the facts make us more confuse about what is real and what is not..Just imagine what it is going to be, if it happens to be your children or any kids/teenagers who still do not really know about this actual historical fact. They will definitely believe in whatever the content of the movie which full of lies and twisted facts. Thus, more and more lies/confusion will be spread.  Beside, this movie said 'a hero try to fight evil'...and in my opinion the evil is more likely to be the vampire(evil monster)..and seeking help from evil creature will only make you as evil as it is.   Now the world, and society think that vampire is not really bad/evil/harmful. why?..because from previous film such as twilight, vampire diaries they already showed and successfully implemented the good side of vampire. And society also think that vampire does not exist in this world. so, why bother to care whether they are good or bad..Again in my opinion, why making film on something that does not exist??. Why they want to convey false message to the society??. The answer is simple: money&entertainment. And unfortunately, there are group of people who believe in this myth and would like to believe that vampire does exist in this world. Again why this happen, because we learn from observation and watching.  together we make a better future, spread facts, not lies and fight real evil, the world need honesty and good example to be practiced and believe..

It could easily be an 8/10  Seriously having him fight one thousand soldiers with bare hands and showing all this with a pathetic camera movement through a sword's reflection didn't pay him any respect at all. I was expecting something like Matrix where Neo VS Smiths was well demonstrated and we saw Neo counter them all despite getting hit. The same should have been done here with Dracula getting hit and fighting back. Instead of this he just punched and pushed some of them, then took a halberd and the rest battle was a sword reflection with 1v1 battles.   What I wanna point out is that Hollywood nowadays will not give as powerful cinematography in action sequences. Most movies have shaky events happening in the blink of an eye or one-two hits in just one shot and then moving fast to another shot of the same shaky speed.   We need bigger action sequences in shots. Demonstrate his superior speed and swordsmanship. That is all.

Hüküm sürdüğü memlekete Fâtih'in yardımı ile sahip olmasına ve Pâdişaha karşı dost kalacağına dair yemin etmiş bulunmasına rağmen Wlad, sözünde durmayarak Osmanlılar aleyhine Macarlarla anlasma yapacaktır.Fâtih'in, Karadeniz ve Trabzon'da bulundugu sıralarda, Eflâk'ta bazı hadiseler olmaktaydı. Burada Türklerin ""Kazıklı Voyvoda"", Macarlarin ""Drakula"" (Şeytan), Ulahların ""Çepelpuç"" (Cellad) dedikleri Wlad adında zulüm delisi bir adam, halka idarenin en korkuncunu tattırmaktadır. Bu çılgın adam, vahşi ve insanlık dışı birtakım zevklere sahipti. O, kazıklara vurulmuş ve işkence içinde can vermekte olan Türklerin meydana getirdigi büyük halkanın ortasında, saray halkı ile birlikte yemek yemekten zevk alırdı. Eline Türk esirleri geçince ayaklarındaki derinin yüzülmesini ve meydana çıkan kırmızı etlere tuz ekilmesini, sonra da bunları keçilere yalatmasını emrederdi. Böylece, diri diri ayaklarının derisi yüzülen esirlerin işkencesi, daha büyük olurdu. O, kendisine gönderilen Osmanlı elçilerinin sarıklarını başlarına çiviletmiştir. Fâtih Sultan Mehmed, onu İstanbul'a davet eder. Ancak Wlad, düşmanlarının çokluğundan ve memlekette bulunmadığı bir sırada tac ve tahtının Macarlara verileceğinden korktuğundan, Eflâk'ı düşmanlarına karşı muhafaza edecek bir kuvvetin gönderilmesini rica eder. Bunun üzerine Pâdişah, Silistre Beyi Yunus Bey ile Çakırcıbaşı Hamza Bey'i Eflâk'i beklemek üzere görevlendirir. Yunus Bey ile ÇakırcIbaşı Hamza Bey, Tuna kenarına geldikleri vakit, nehrin donmuş olduğunu görürler. Bununla beraber Tuna'yı geçmek hazırlıkları yaptıkları ve dostluktan başka bir şey ümid etmedikleri, hatta itibar göreceklerini sandıkları bir sırada Wlad'ın büyük bir saldırısına uğrarlar. Bu baskında Yunus Bey şehid, Hamza Bey de esir edilmişti. Wlad, daha sonra Hamza Bey'i öldürerek başını Macar kralına gönderir. Kan dökücü Wlad, aldığı esirlerin tamamını kazığa vurduktan sonra, Osmanlılara ait bazı sehir ve kasabaları tahrip etmekten de çekinmez.Bütün bu olanları haber alan Fâtih Sultan Mehmed, hiddetinden ve üzüntüsünden yerinde duramayarak 150 bin kişilik bir ordu ve 25 büyük, 150 küçük parça deniz kuvveti (nehir donanması) hazırlayarak, Allah'ın kullarına zulm eden bu zâlimi ortadan kaldırmak için Eflâk seferine çıkar (H. 866/1462 M.) Fâtih, Eflâk ortalarına kadar gittiği halde, Wlad'in kuvvetleri ortalarda görünmüyorlardı. Wlad, Fâtih'in, casusları vasıtasiyle önceden haber aldığı bir gece baskını düzenleyerek Pâdişahı öldürmek ister. Fakat bunda muvaffak olamadığı gibi, perişan bir halde canını zor kurtarıp kaçabilir.

Fakat Macar Kralı, hiç yoktan Osmanlılarla bir anlaşmazlığa düşmek istemediğinden bu yardımı yapmamış, hatta Wlad'i yakalayarak haps etmişti. Öte taraftan Osmanlılar, Wlad'in kardeşi Radul'u oniki bin duka yıllık vergiye bağlayarak Eflâk prensliğinin başına getirdiler. Böylece Eflâk, mümtaz bir eyâlet haline getirilerek, Osmanlılara sıkıca bağlanmış oldu.

2015-11-08T19:54:19,"Yes it's a fantasy movie and it can follow any scenario. Vlad III. is a historical character and maybe a hero to Romanian. However Mehmed II. is another historical character and a hero to another nation. If you want to change to historical events here, then you should not use historical names. If you want to tell the ""untold"" story then you could have called him just ""sultan"" and make him fight a random sultan. So therefore you could bypass all the ""haters"". Other way,  you are killing a historical person in an irrelevant place with an irrelevant way by an irrelevant person which is so dumb. (And nothing close to an ""untold"" story)  The truth is: The war was started because Vlad III. did not pay the tribute (In the movie cause is Vlad's denial of giving 1000 children to Mehmed.) Vlad the Impaler in fact could not protect his home, lost the war against Mehmed the Conqueror and betrayed by Hungary in 1462.

But I don't get why people are so annoyed about the story.   I mean, not every movie adaptation is supposed to fit perfectly the story from which it took his main elements. One of the most interesting thing about an ""adaptation"" of a book is the way the directors see the story and the way they artistically change it according to their point of view. Cinema is a form of art quite free and that's why it's interesting. Moreover, when they decide to make a movie, directors don't sign a ""faithfulness charter"" saying they really have to follow the original storyline. A book is a book. A movie is a movie. They're both different. Please, stop always wanting every """"adaptation"""" to be absolutely true to the original format. Try to consider a book as a book and a movie as a movie.

His father Vlad II Dracul, got the epithet Dracul because he was in the Order of the Dragon which is the Order that was fighting against spreading of Islam, and was fighting to protect Christians in Europe from the Ottoman Turks. It was founded by King Sigismund of Hungary, and later the Holy Roman Emperor. In Latin, the Order was called ""Ordo dracorum"". So Dracula's father was actually Vlad II the Dragon, and not the Devil, like people today think. So Dracula was something like Dragonling or something.

He went right in the middle of the camp, seeking to kill the Sultan.

He practically invented the Special Ops and commando units. Oh, when Turks managed to track his movements, using the marks left by the horses on the ground, and surrounded him in a castle, they found an empty place filled with impaled ranking ottoman officers. Because  the horseshoes were deliberately mounted in reverse, just to give the impression he is retreating somewhere, when in fact he and all his troops were going  the opposite way.

Yeah, Disney edits the fairy tales and legends of the source material, that doesn't mean its weak or broken.  Yeah so what if Hollywood movie pagan gods and Marvel pagan gods have more of morality than their original?  Yeah so what if they made Dracula a good guy in some interpretations of stories?  I say to you all, *so fucking what?*  Oh yeah never mind the good these interpretations had done or other stories they've inspired or how happy they make people, nope, better off without 'em.

2018-05-25T14:08:15,"J'en ai vu des NAVETS et des BOUSES mais alors là ce fill Dracula Untold en est une ENORME ! Je viens de le regarder sur Netflix il est réellement d'une médiocrité ahurissante. De la propagande et bourré de désinformations. Le grand méchant Musulman envahissant l'Europe et Dracul comme  seul sauveur et rampart pour éviter que les méchants musulmans s'emparent de l'Europe. Mdr et pourtant je suis de confession Catholique j'dis ça j'dis rien. Quand je disais bourré de désinformations c'est aussi parce-que c'est du grand foutage de gueule, est-ce que quelqu'un a réellement cru que les Turcs donc Ottomans parlent l'Arabe et l'écrivent aussi ?  Euh cherchez l'erreur. Les paraboles ne manquent pas on essaye insidieusement de faire l'amalgame car le film est remplit de séquences où on voit l'écriture Arabe ainsi que des drapeaux flottant ornées de signes et de mots en langue Arabe or là où on nous prend réellement pour des cons c'est que juste les Turcs ne sont ni Arabe, ni ne parle Arabe, ni même l'écrivent. Ils ont leur langue, leur littérature et leur écriture qui est plus proche des écritures européennes et à la fois des pays de L'Est. Le réalisateur et scénaristes et producteurs usent de signe et de références Historique, les détournent et s'en servent vicieusement pour placer dans le film des amalgames éhontés. Ou alors ceux qui ont fabriqué cette merde de film sont totalement cons et emplit de clichés ou préjugés. Il aurait fallu qu'il fasse des recherches d'histoire. Faut croire qu'ils pensaient et pensent sûrement encore que nos voisins Turcs parlent et écrivent en Arabe. La seule chose qu'ils ont en rapport avec le Moyen-Orient c'est la religion et encore pas tous sont musulmans certains sont chrétiens tout comme pas tous dans les pays Arabes sont musulmans car beaucoup sont chrétiens. Mais encore une fois j'dis ça j'dis rien. De plus les Ottomans autrement dit les Turcs sont ceux qui ont exporté l'Islam un peu partout dans l'Afrique et Afrique du Nord. Non mais sérieusement j'etais en train d'éclater quand j'ai visionné les scènes avec les drapeaux pseudos Turcs ornées de cette belle langue qu'est L'Arabe  (qui de plus est aussi très usité dans la languz française car faisant partie intégrante d'elle). J'en ai littéralement pleuré de rire tellement c'est hilarant. Mais sérieusement ils sont idiots ceux qui ont fait ce films. De plus moi qui suis fan de l'histoire originelle de Dracula et du livre Roman sur ce comte vampire mais aussi sur la vraie histoire du compte Dracul qui a effectivement combattu les Ottomans mais justement l'histoire la vraie est toute autre et non pas comme elle est véhiculée a travers ce film ou plutôt cette bouse qu'ils ont osé appelé un film. A la rigueur s'ils avaient respecté les faits, les personnages historiques, les personnes mythologiques ok ca passerait mais là cette merde hollywoodienne m'a fait presque vomir au final. Ah qu'on m'explique d'où sort ce gus enfermé dans qa grotte et qui donne le pouvoir de vampire au Comte Dracula ?  Ah oui c'est vrai faut pas être Einstein pour comprendre que ce personnage est juste là pour faire de valoir à une possible suite sur grand ecran. Markting et marketing. Quand au scenario, acteurs et décors ils sont tout autant dans la médiocrité. Ca vole au ras des pâquerette les répliques toutes prêtes à l'emploi on les as vu venir. C'est du pur réchauffé bien puant. Vu et rererevu donc mais cette fois dans la médiocrité totale. Curieusement ils avaient fait ce film en insérant un paquet de désinformations pour déverser de la  bonne vieille propagande bien de chez nous juste quand des sujets et thèmes sont d'actualités. J'ai perdu 1h32 de ma vie. Jaurais mieux fait de sortir me promener et profiter de lon jour et we prolongé avant la reprise du travail lundi.

And Fatih Sultan Mehmed ended all of that, I mean do researches ? Like in Wikipedia or Google it at least. There is a scene in the movie where that one guys tells Dracula that Sultan Mehmed wants 1000 boys for his army, for f*cks sake. Getting into a janissary army was harder than getting into, Harvard, Yale or even UCLA. Because they only took son's of noble family's or boys who would fit in. And those family's were happy about that, because at that time Istanbul was like the capital of the world, there were perfect education and every family would be super happy about those news.  Again, I can understand that you guys loved the acting etc. I respect that. But I find it rude that they are representing my ancestor like that, and shoving a fucking murderer like a hero and fighter for hope.  My ancestor went to war for peace and  for his own country and people. But Vlad, that psycho is a betraying serial killer.

2019-03-25T20:50:18,"Dracula's film untold its storyline is designed by hollywood to deceive the actual history that took place. Indeed there is historical evidence, and it does happen. But it's not like that made in this movie. King Vlad dracul is the father of vlad dracul i, ii and iii and the youngest of rads. Two of his children became political ransom for the turkey government of sultan murad II because the wallachia government became a state under the turkey government. Vlad dracul iii and radu lived in turkey castles for several years to be given knowledge, skills and knowledge under the turkey kingdom at that time. He is not tortured as is accused by the west. She is well cared for her future rule of wallachia kingdom. translyvania pan countries wanted to fight with a very strong turkey government at that time causing the wallachia state to withdraw from war. Because of that, wallachia is subject to another translovania pan and they attack on wallachia. Which caused the king vlad dracul and his son to die killed. Because of that, he wanted to take revenge on the fate of his father and brother who caused him to be very cruel. So he was called vlad dracul iii the impaler (the ruler). He also killed many of his own people and his enemies mercilessly. If you love and care for this vladimul, there is a problem with your mind and heart. He also bore a turkey government that supposedly caused his father and brother to die. He said ""if I am not in a turkey palace, my father and brother should not be killed"". While turkey has nothing to do with the death of his family. Since that incident, he has begun to transform into a cruel man who sowed the beast before becoming a brutal terrorist attack by the people and his enemies. Her sister is not like that, her sister is so kind and gentle. Her sister finally accepted Islam. It is also the son of the king of mystery II, Muhammad Al-fateh, who fought against this cruel vlad dracul. Assisted by his own sister radu. Finally he was killed. Ends cruelty vlad dracul iii the violent impaler. The allegations to the turkey king allegedly accusing Vlad Dracul III of wanting 1000 people and wanting to take vlad children is a real lie. But allegations of the killing of the turkey troops were indeed due to the fact that history has confirmed vlad dracul killing thousands of enemy troops and he puts a dead body in the jungle until the jungle is called a corpse. History has been lied and changed by hollywood to hide the truth. It's easy for you to cheat them with this movie.",0,0,Kedah Tua 1821,_2aWqecTTuE,-0.05375000000000001,2019-03-25 20:50:18,False,False

2019-03-30T19:50:57,"When the Catholic Hungarians invaded Orthodox Romania, the Romanian king were looking for an alliance with the Ottoman Empire.   To celebrate this alliance, the Romanian king gave 2 princes, so they could educate themselves in one of the world's best education cities, Edirne. The Romanian king were holding on to the oldest son, because he would become the next Romanian king.   Time passed and Mehmet the 2nd became the Ottoman sultan in Edirne.   The Catholic Hungarians invaded Romania again, and this time they captured the Romanian king and his oldest son. The king and the son were tortered, blinded and buried alive.   When Mehmed heard about this, he went to his childhood friend Vlad, and gave him several thousand Janissaries, so that Vlad could avenge his father.   When Vlad came to Romania, he was captured by the Catholic Hungarians. The Hungarian king, who had brutally killed his father and older brother, asked if Vlad would become a subject working for him. Vlad accepted the deal and started to kill innocent muslim villagers, who were most often women and children. Vlad was even getting money from the Pope, in Rome, to continue with his genocide. There are reports Vlad sent to the Pope, which are still open for public in Rome today.   When Mehmed heard about this, he gave some Janissaries to Vlad's brother, Radu the handsome (he was famous among the girls in Istanbul, hence the name). Radu took back the throne of Romania.   When Vlad was killed, his body parts were sent to the capital, and put on the city walls (the only time Ottoman Empire did this).   The reason Vlad is connected to vampirism is because he used to drink red wine from the skulls of innocent children.  Some even say that he drank blood from freshly cut heads.   More interestingly, this guy is considered a national hero in Romania, when in fact he betrayed the Romanian nation and his family by working for the murderer of his family and his people.",1,0,tinecaa tinecaa,_2aWqecTTuE,0.16538461538461538,2019-03-30 19:50:57,False,False

The reason being is because this type of Dracula reminds me intensely of my older brother Timothy. The one outstanding thing that my older brother really and sincerely admired was the mighty strength in characters precisely like this  Dracula. Some may wonder where it is that I get my own strength and ambition and it is in this element of bringing that which my older brother loved so very much to the arena of life. I know that he would have been unquestionably a proud Luke Evans fan. All I can say now is I love you Tim and I miss you and every important thing that you admired I will try valiantly to keep representing that dazzling part of you in this life.
