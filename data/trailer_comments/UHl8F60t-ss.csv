The tribe is honestly the most colourful set, and the tribesmen and women are honestly the most multi cultural group of people. I know we all read the books and have seen the previous films and they stick pretty closely. Looking at the tribe, any person of any ethnicity could have been the role, and I know people are annoyed that it is a white woman as the role.  Look at the new Annie film for example. Annie has always been a white child with red hair. But now she is a young black child in the new film coming out soon. We need to accept that reboots now a days are putting spins on everything, and ethnicities are being swapped around all the time. But we all need to remember that this is a complete reboot. And Rooney does a great job. Enjoy the film everyone! :)",10,7,Louise Horsley,UHl8F60t-ss,0.2347451790633609,2014-11-26 00:10:43,True,True

The Natives of Neverland don't necessarily have to be the dark skinned Native AMERICANS that we know and we recognize from the Disney version of the film. They could very well be portrayed as a settlement and culture of former lost children who became trapped on Neverland and formed a tribe over the years. Much like how the English boys of Lord of the Flies formed a sort of ""native tribe"" of their own when they were marooned on an island. And I also agree with the idea that perhaps she was adopted into the tribe and made a princess due to whatever circumstances. Don't automatically assume that ""native"" = dark skin and dark hair. Native is simply just a term to describe a person who lives in a certain place. And whether it's a dark or light skinned Tiger Lily, she's still the Native Princess of Neverland.  ",1,0,Alycia Ramirez,UHl8F60t-ss,0.07946428571428572,2014-11-26 08:17:50,True,True

2014-11-28T16:22:33,"This is terrible. It is an abomination. The makers of this film have basically just said that they can come up with a better story than the original creator of these characters and situations. And in doing so, they have raped the works and history of many REAL people - all for the sake of a buck.  Why is this garbage? Here's just one list, I'm sure others can add to it:  1. Peter was never raised in an orphanage, nor longed for a missing mother - he ran away as an infant and was found by fairies and taken to Neverland.  2. Peter isn't a deep-voiced, pre-teen - he is a CHILD. We're not talking about ""like a child"", as in, ""even adults can have the spirit of a child"" - he is literally a LITTLE BOY. SO, fail on the part of the producers for trying to pander to tweenagers...  3. Obvious rip offs of Oliver Twist, Speilberg's Hook and the 1998 Mask of Zorro are obvious....  4. Blackbeard was a real person - an actual, authentic historical person - and why the hell would he be wearing medieval European armor?!? As much as I like Jackman, the film makers have made him look ridiculous. And again - obvious attempt to capture the same sensationalism of Gary Oldman's Dracula appearance is obvious.  5. Hook.....really? It is demeaning to the character of James Hook to make him just some pretty boy poser who knew Peter BEFORE he was a pirate. It's a pale, boring story idea compared to the eternal nemesis which Hook and Peter are in the original story  6. And, of course - as many people have pointed out - the flat out INSULT of having white people play Native Americans. And again, anyone who has ever bothered to read the actual book Peter Pan knows that the tribe of Indians who live on Neverland are (perhaps inappropriately) referred to as ""redskins"". No matter what you think of the political correctness of Barrie's use of terminology, he was clearly writing about Native Americans. This cheap, lazy, beauty-obsessed form of casting is an insult to anyone who isn't shallow and ignorant.  The worse part about this entire debacle is how overly hyped it will be over the course of the next several months and how the demographic of illiterate, materialistic sheep it is being made for will simply accept it as ""AMAZING"" and obediently share that ""opinion"" everywhere and continuously.  Hollywood is garbage dump. The common, cookie-cutter movie watcher is just as unimaginative. And Warner Bros is nothing more than a Marketing Company and Investment firm who knows full well that you don't have to have a good story to make money - just a lot of mindless imbeciles who will buy into the hype....",0,0,CO Rober,UHl8F60t-ss,0.04382034632034632,2014-11-28 16:22:33,True,True

2014-12-16T04:48:00,"I like the other version where Pan is known as a trickster in his village, named Peter Jones. His son, Killian, finds pixie dust in a tree that can transport him between realms, to get away from the village. A witch named Tink comes and tells him that the dust has a price, that the land it takes you to is a land where you never grow old, and never can leave. Killian didn't listen to her and showed his father. The father new exactly what it did, and they went through the portal to a place called Neverland. When they arrived, Peter tells him about the wonders the place holds. How you can fly and how you can do whatever you want, as long as you believe. One day, the father realized that he could not fly and couldn't bear the fact that he couldn't. Then, a shadow comes along and tells him that he's not a kid anymore, and that adults don't belong in Neverland. Furious, he tells the shadow to take away his son, because he's the only thing that's stopping him from believing he's a young boy. The shadow does so and takes him to the real world, while Peter turns into a young boy again. Even though he could fly, he wanted more. He snuck into where the shadow rests, and captured it using light, and made it his own, taking control of Neverland. After many decades of being on the island, no change, no nothing, Peter regrets his decision and goes to real world to find his son (time in Neverland isn't the same as in the real world, a couple decades in Neverland would be 20-25 years for us). Once he's there, he uses a special Pan flute to take control of boys, in hopes that one of them is his son (Pied Piper). He uses his shadow to capture them all and bring them back to Neverland. None of them were his son, and so he made them stay on the island. Every night the boys would cry, missing their parents. Peter called them, The Lost Boys. In the real world, Killian trained in the Navy, he quit because of his hand getting cut off. Everyday he'd hear about ""Pan"" and how he captured all their sons, yet he never believed it was his father. One night, Wendy, his wife, told him that she was pregnant with two boys. They were scared to think that their sons could be taken away by Pan. One of them was named John, and the other Micheal. One day, Peter Pan came and played his flute, attracting his sons. When Killian woke up, he knew it was his father. He went back to the forest where he found the Pixie dust, and Tink says he cant have it unless he gives up his wife. After talking, Wendy insist that he finds them, no matter the cost. Tink gives him Pixie dust. He takes his friend, William Smee along with him, where they use a motorboat to go to Neverland. Once the get there, the motorboat transforms into a big ship called the Jolly Rodger, since things never grow old, modern day things don't exist there. He finds a hook on this ship, and puts it in the place of his hand, giving him the name Captain Hook. They still search for him now, in hopes they can find him and escape Neverland, the home of Pan.",0,0,Nevin F,UHl8F60t-ss,0.15731741376902664,2014-12-16 04:48:00,True,True

I think I'd rather go re-watch the  Hook movie from the 90s with Robin Williams.  At least that one looked more original and had Robin Williams in it.  I do like Hugh Jackman but I prefer him as Wolverine so I'll just wait til the next X-Men movie to see him. ,0,0,Lexi Love,UHl8F60t-ss,-0.03854166666666667,2014-12-24 06:31:38,True,True

Also, they sort iof establish a mythology around the island, with the miners and all. I can roll with that. -Flying ships and floating island : again, in the book , the island is a legit island on the ocean, and there's no flying ship. I guess we have to thank Disney for this imagery. But I'm not to disturbed by that,'cause I dig flying ships !! -Hugh Jackman as Black Beard looks faaaabulous!... -Glad they get a young actor to play Peter. - This new Hook is reminescent of Colin O' Donogue's Hook.

As someone who has always loved Peter Pan and has attempted to read and see every version of the tale, I was hoping this film would be closer to the original. The descriptions said that it was a ""haunting"" take on the fairy tale. In case you don't know, the original Peter Pan was not happy (who'd have guessed, Disney made it child friendly). In the original Peter Pan, Peter kills his Lost Boys when they decide to grow old and Peter kills Hook. However, now that I see this trailer I am disappointed that it does not carry out what I had hoped. I will see it eventually, but not in theaters. A fair warning to anyone looking for something close to the original book, I recommend Peter Pan from 2003 and Once Upon A Time's Neverland season (I believe it is season 3-mainly 3B) while neither of these are exactly perfect (but nothing will be) they each carry out certain parts of the story so perfectly that if they were to mix together a bit, you'd have a nearly perfect film. ",0,0,Mara B,UHl8F60t-ss,0.39308035714285716,2015-02-11 16:18:34,True,True

People need to stop giving it more power by blaming it. It's no different than if it were about red or blonde hair. True, Hollywood should also consider the appearance of a beloved character, but it should be about preserving the story-not a color war. I have no problem with Tiger Lily being pale. One of my favorite Tigerlilies was the one from the Mary Martin Peter Pan. She was adorable and authoritative. My other favorite was the one from 2003 because of how she insulted Captain Hook instead of just shutting her mouth and sticking her nose in the air. While I do think that the MOVIE casts should be made up (even if just with MAKEUP, like Johnny Depp in Lone Ranger) to look like the beloved characters, it's because of story integrity. Did you know that Wendy is darker in this? Staring in a role in a point in time where there was REAL and true segregation? Where they had to live in a separate, crappy neighborhood because it was the law? If book Wendy had been darker, they would not have had the Darling residence. Again, story integrity. That was racism, not this.   On actual movie, slightly excited. Wish it were Annasophia Robb playing Wendy like it was rumored when the rumors first came out. I'm interested to see the new take even though I know nothing can beat the book or the movie closet to the book. I like that we get to see Hook be Blackbeard's boatswain. I'd like to know (in theory) what that had to do with anything in the book. I always wondered what the big deal about Hook was because the book said his true identity would cause a riot.",0,0,poohbearfreak1,UHl8F60t-ss,0.2036946386946387,2015-02-14 06:57:43,True,True

Aren't they supposed to be Native Americans and not a South American tribe 6. Why is Tiger Lilly the only white person in the tribe 7. Doesn't making a Peter Pan origin story defeat the purpose of his character, I mean all were supposed to know is that he's young and magical and it the mystery of who Peter is that makes him all the more interesting. Giving Peter an origin story is like showing the shark in Jaws, it takes away any of the mystery to the character. Peter is meant to be the spirit of Neverland. He's the idea of childhood wonder and innocence and by giving him a back story you take away his relatability. Where Hook took away this innocence and made Peter reflect on what makes him who he is. But Hook was meant for older people to show that you could still be a kid at heart. Peter was still an idea, we know very little about him. The original Peter Pan story made Peter as more of a guide and a spirit. Someone who you could see yourself in but who also seemed to have more to them and it was that mystery that made the character and the character was the idea of childhood. Basically a personification of something people lose over time. As we get older Peter stops coming showing that innocence is lost. Peter is meant to seem supernatural something that has always existed and always will exist and making him human takes that away.Sure we know a little about Peter but only a little.That makes him relatable.",0,0,The Mr. Friday Show,UHl8F60t-ss,0.12212301587301587,2015-02-16 20:51:21,True,True
