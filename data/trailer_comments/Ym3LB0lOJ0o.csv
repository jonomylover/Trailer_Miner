The dark, grim look of the movie mixed with the eerie music by Trent ""Badass"" Reznor really adds atmosphere and curiosity for the viewer.  2. Fincher working with 20th Century Fox again should be another home run. They made Fight Club together, remember? 20th Century Fox is a great film studio.  3. The fact the writer of the novel wrote the script only adds my anticipation even more. While it doesn't always work (ex. The Cider House Rules), this has a good chance.  4. Fincher can make any movie of any genre fucking awesome. True visual talent. Seriously Hollywood, stop wasting your time with that shithead Michael Bay and pay more attention to him.  5. Affleck seems like a real good fit for the lead role. He looks absolutely exhausted though. The entire cast looks very good as well.  6. The plot seems fascinating and also seems like a good social commentary on how the media views missing people or murder.   7. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography. Jesus Christ can this man shoot a movie. He's just like his father Jordan (He shot Blade Runner, one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.)  Overall, I cannot wait till it comes out. I'm gonna go see it exactly on Halloween. However, I do have one problem: I think instead of showing, ""From the Director of ""Se7en & The Social Network,"" they should take out The Social Network part. Don't get me wrong, it's one of my favorite movies, but it has nothing to do with the Mystery thriller genre. They should have put, ""From David Fincher, director of Se7en, Zodiac and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""

Rosamund is a brilliant actress, but in my opinion Amy should have been presented as a more loveable person, someone you didn't expect to be what she actually is. Also, there were several parts that I found very unconvincing regarding police investigation and Amy's behaviour especially towards the end. But it was a good movie.

2014-10-15T02:10:55,"Thought I'd add my review here, spoiler free if anyone was worried.   Gone Girl may be the most twisted film I've ever seen.  Going to see it with my brother It was very hard for us to even communicate on whether or not we liked it or hated it, or what exactly we just watched. However, after an hour to process and to really let it sink in, it is very clear that Gone Girl is a masterpiece.   I don't even wanna tell you any details on the story, but for the sake of a written review - It's about a guy named Nick Dunn who comes home to find his wife missing, and it seems she may have gone through a struggle at home. She goes missing and inevitably the possibility comes up that Nick may have murdered his wife.  David Fincher is one of the best directors in the business and he sells no short than another great film to place among a long list of great ones he's already made. Each shot is just as if not more important than the last. He doesn't necessarily spoon feed you everything and there are elements in this film that I NEVER saw coming. Which is always the best thing when watching a film.  Ben Affleck is Batman folks, and if you watch this film you will understand that we got a damn good actor to hold that mantle. He is perfect for this role for one main reason, the character he portrays mirrors his life in a lot of ways. Affleck has been under public scrutiny his entire life and just recently was being completely hammered for his opinions on Muslims. The character of Nick Dunn shows why you can't just let the news, or any piece of media create your judgement's for you. Do your research and understand that there are two sides to every door, and boy does Affleck understand that to a T.   Rosamund Pike...Give her a fucking Oscar. End of story.  Other actors such as Tyler Perry (brilliant in this film as his new rendition of Madea the badass lawyer) and Neil Patrick Harris fit very well and serve their purpose to the story perfectly.   As I said, this film is a damn masterpiece. There is not much else to say but that you should rush to your nearest theater and watch it immediately, because Gone Girl deserves a 5/5. ",781,73,Caboose,Ym3LB0lOJ0o,0.19418062200956943,2014-10-15 02:10:55,False,True

The movie brings the subject of marriage, media, and the simple showing of how we get from one point to another, the line being what have we done to each other. Now the score is easily the best of the year, if not top 10 or 20 of all time. Performances are top notch, directing is amazing, it screams all the elements an amazing movie has. But unlike most films, it has a sense of mysteriousness throughout. Maybe it's the soundtrack, performances, or directing style, but the movie always keeps you guessing, and when climaxes or intense scenes come the movie knocks you out. The movie is incredible with the deep psychology of American Psycho. Don't hate on the movie when you already payed $12 to see the new Transformers and you came out saying meh.

This is a woman who listened to the entire book on audio, knowing every twist and turn the film was going to make, and was hard to be surprised in a theatre because of. Then i am remembered of your existence.   While sitting in the opening credits, i'm enthralled of the film's score from the start. The creepiness of it, etc. Then i start reading, and say ""Oh wow!!! David Fincher directed this? really???????"". Wife didn't respond, as this meant nothing to her. So then i explained....""David Fincher....directed Zodiac. NUFF SAID""   Then i said "" David Fincher, he directed Benjamin Button...NUFF SAID"".   She gave me a look and i could tell SHE wanted to tell me ""nuff said"". So we just watched the movie.   Before the beginning credits ended, i was already in love with this movie. I knew Fincher wouldn't let me down. To start, i haven't been this nervous in a movie since The Call. I loved everything about it. They couldn't get better actors or actresses for these parts (wife will disagree since she hates Ben) however i thought he played it out nicely.   Halfway in the movie, i thought ""WOW..........FATAL ATTRACTION"". (if you haven't seen this movie you are encouraged too). Then i thought, ""no. this is 2014's Fatal Attraction"" and i was in a for a ride for my life.   But we all know the biggest subject to date now is ""the ending of this movie.....what...."". However i believe Zach and I are the only people that share the appreciation of such ending. Ask yourself, do we really want an ending that pulls every piece together perfectly?

The acting in this movie was the highlight of this disturbing cinematic masterpiece. Rosamund Pike. Holy shit. The girl had all  some serious acting chops and she gave one of the best performances I have ever seen by an actress or a villain in general( definitely deserves a oscar nod). Ben Affleck, did a decent job in the movie playing the framed husband. Neil Patrick Harris. I have always watching him on HIMYM and I think this was a career defining role for him. AND TYLER PERRY! He doesn't need to dress up like an old lady. He's got some acting chops! Hopefully he continues on this path and delve further into movies like this. The story and the pacing of the movie was fantastically done and David Fincher did yet another awesome job at directing ( I am definitely looking forward to his next movie).

The countless plot twists had me flipping back ond forth, and I've read throughout the comments that they did not like the ending, but I thought it was brilliant. This film was not about the action but just how messed up and disjointed life is, and what more to cap that off with than a ending that no one would agree with. Because Nick was right. If he left Amy he would be completely ridiculed, and she would still win in the whole scheme of things. It just reflects upon the fact that Amy had ruined the life of every man she came in contact with, just this way he is getting the best that he can out of this, because either way she will be perceived as a hero through the media, and that way he wouldn't let her ruin his life any more than she already has.  Now to the performances. Both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike were at the top of their game, NPH had me completely forget his days as Barney, playing not the lovable goof but (one of the many, MANY) psychopaths in this film. Tyler Perry was amazing. Everyone at the top of their game. Oscars nominations (At least) all round.   Good work David Fincher. I would recommend this to everyone. Watch it. Rewatch it.

2015-01-28T16:33:44,"SPOILER-FREE.  As is the case with 99% of books adapted into films, it is simply impossible to include every thought, moment, and detail that is integral to the story and its closure. This is true of most film adaptations of novels, and is ESPECIALLY true in this case because it relies so heavily on what is happening beneath the surface- the thoughts and emotional/psychological states of Nick and Amy. I think anyone who has read Gone Girl would agree that the depth Gillian Flynn goes into the minds of both Nick and Amy in the book is absolutely crucial in understanding the ending, and the reason the book is so phenomenal is because of this depth. However, psychological states and thoughts are not easily manifested on a screen, which is why so many people have been left confused and unsatisfied. That's why it's a book, and not a movie, to begin with. If anyone wants to understand why it ended the way it did, and why it made sense, read the book- you will not be disappointed.  That being said, I have been waiting to see this movie for months, and given the sheer volume of what happens in the book and how much it does depend on what happens within the characters, I was supremely impressed by how well they were able to capture the story! I don't think they could have done anything better- the actors, the exposition, the development, the soundtrack- it all captured the mood of the book perfectly, and in ONE movie. Peter Jackson could learn a thing or two. :)  PS, it DID all happen.",0,0,coastal court139,Ym3LB0lOJ0o,0.20674603174603176,2015-01-28 16:33:44,False,False

2015-02-15T22:26:44,"SPOILERS:  Am I the only one who liked the ending? It's clear from the book that they both were sociopaths. They had a sadistic, toxic relationship and yet, in a perverse kind of way, they both needed and deserved each other. Nick always despised his father, and feared turning into him. Consequently, he always wanted to be the good guy, the hero. And with Amy he could be. He could play the role of the doting husband and the loving father, and could have a family like he always wanted. The ending didn't end as explosively as I thought it would (with Nick killing his wife, or the other way around), but I thought it was perfect. It didn't predictably end with the bad guy (or in this case girl) getting punished, and i think that underscores the fact that in real life, justice isn't always served.  On a side note; I studied the Shakespearean play 'Othello' in school. One of the major faults of the play is that the villain Iago doesn't die. In Shakespearean dramas the villain always dies. My English teacher told me that this is due to the fact that as humans, we have this deeply engrained desire for justice. We like to be assured that the bad guy will be caught and punished and that the good guy will always triumph. This doesn't happen in this movie however, and I think that might be the reason why some people are pissed off with the ending. Because it is unsatisfying. However I think it's supposed to be. As like I said earlier, in reality justice isn't always served. But that can be a bitter pill for us to swallow. Sorry for this being so long!

So basically Amy gets away with murder? And everyone seems so cool and nonchalant about the fact that she slit a man's throat. No one interrogates her about this. What did she do with his body? I think that is the biggest question mark about this movie. While it was good and certainly very captivating all the way through, the ruthless and abrupt murder was literally where I had to pause the movie and say ""what the fuck"" to myself. I see some comments suggesting that the events of the movie were all just in her head. I don't think thats the case though - that would be too obvious. I think this movie is directed and written in such a way to be complex on purpose. But its so annoying! Needless to say, I legit have no idea what the fuck I just watched.

2015-07-23T22:07:35,"Marriage is for the weak!  Marriage causes bad parenting, legal issues, and murder!  Think twice before you ""tie the knot"". Chances are it will come back around to bite you in the ass, hard! Having a solid relationship is just as great, if not much better, if you're not married. All marriage is, is a word and a bunch of unnecessary paperwork. If things go south, chances are that one of you will go broke and lose everything to the other, including your kids. I don't believe in marriage, never have, never will! And I am living an amazing life and, guess what!...I'm not miserable or broke because of a bad choice in getting married.  Sure, there were a few girls who I would have loved to marry, and I have been proposed to numerous times. But as good as those relationships were for a long time, they ended badly, as do ALL RELATIONSHIPS!  Love is not meant to last, anyone who says differently is either lying or is just plain STUPID! It definitely lasts a little while, but never a long while. People get tired of each other and want to move on. It's human nature. Don't be fooled.  I know, I know....your grandparents were married for 50 years right?? Marriage, back in ancient times like the 1940's, 50's, and early 60's, it was an ultimate sin to get divorced and 9 out of 10 married couples would rather live their lives in misery than get a divorce. That's just how it was.  Now are you going to say that you've been ""happily married"" for 10 years? Or maybe 5 years? Did you marry your high school sweetheart?? Well other than the fact that ten years is not a very long time, trust me when I say, it will not last.  No, I'm not angry or hurt, in fact just the opposite! When a relationship doesn't work out, whether its 10 years or 2 weeks, all I have to do is say exactly that and ABRA CADABRA! I'm single again, no strings attached!! I have had a better love/sex life than most because of this. I never wasted away 20 unhappy years in a miserable marriage where going out drinking with my friends is the ultimate crime. My phone was rarely ringing off the hook looking for me, asking 10 times an hour what I'm doing and where I am. And if that did ever happen, I put a stop to it. Why? Because I wasn't married and COULD put a stop to it at any point I choose.   Some people are just way too insecure to not get married. Its like a lifeline for you, telling you, ""if you don't think its working out then don't you worry! Its all legalized on paper so he/she can't leave you that easily!!""  That's all marriage is, and its mainly for 2 types of people...the stupid, and the insecure. True story!",0,1,Mr. Mayhem,Ym3LB0lOJ0o,0.0035320384743461808,2015-07-23 22:07:35,False,False

Loved the film and have seen it probably five times since it left theatres but I still continue to return to this trailer. Not a hair out of place -- a bit like the film. I think it's the best representation of Fincher's much storied obsession and perfectionism during the filming process. Not one piece of this trailer, or the film for that matter, doesn't feel carefully considered and studied over. Only Fincher can bring this sort of attention to detail to work that others may deem not worthy of his talents. I personally feel that his talents have elevated this celebrated albeit pulpy novel into something much larger and important. It's insights into the media and perception and the way we process images and surfaces is so profound and haunting, and a lot of it is found in Fincher's impeccable craftsmanship.

It's not good enough for you? I hit her? It's not even close! Absolutely not. I never touched her. We feel like Nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter. Without a body, without a murder weapon, their only hope is a confession. You don't know anything yet? You need to tell me. How was your marriage, Nick? Are you asking me if I killed my wife? The man of my dreams. This man of mine may kill me. What about my side? Nick! This man may kill me. In her own words. This man may truly... ... kill me.

Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.  Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else.
