Human go to sleep with crab on face while everyone looks worried about human with crab on face.  Crab falls off human face then everyone has dinner with human who used to have crab on face.  Human who used to have crab on face eats food then begins to choke.  Nasty alien erupts out of human who used to have crab on faces's chest and dies on dining room table.  Alien that erupted out of human who used to have a crab on his face runs away and gets really big really really fast then starts to kill everyone one at a time because everyone is really stupid.  Evil android flips out while alien is killing everyone then spills the beans that Donald Trump knew about the crabby things that hump stupid human faces and he wants one to make America great again.  Super tough Sigourney Weaver wannabe actress is last man (woman) standing and blows alien out of spaceship door into space.  End of story.  How original.

Look at the alien footage in the trailer and you can see a difference in the armor: some are soft and the others are hard.

2017-03-01T21:31:45,"People are complaining about the cgi however in my opinion horror does not come from special effects. The scary part is the slow buildup of whats going to happen combined with character development  e.g. person inhales black goo spores now what will happen to him? physical changes? impregnation of chest burster? or something new? That kind of unknown thing is scary especially if we care about the character and you don't need cgi for this. Then the scare happens when you find out whats happening and thats when around 5 seconds of cgi comes in.  Prometheus tried this twice, once with shaw and the pregnancy of the trilibite which I thought was a very successful horror sequence since we cared about shaw and what the thing inside her was unknown whereas when David put the black goo in that guys drink which was a failed horror sequence because we didn't have enough scenes with him to know his character/see the effect of the black goo and hence we didn't care.",0,0,Starien1,u5KPP6lxRVg,-0.02696834415584415,2017-03-01 21:31:45,True,True

2017-03-02T02:45:43,"First of all, I enjoyed Prometheus. I'm more of a fan of hard sci-fi books as well as on screen. Don’t care much for goofy movies with matchbox cars morphing into huge robots and comedic sci-fi fantasy. Prometheus as well as all other movies certainly had its flaws; no movie is perfect. But it was at least thought provoking, not just a scary shoot em up movie that mostly the Ritalin generation appreciates. That being said, from this teaser it appears that Mr. Scott decided to go the route of bringing back the scary shoot em up type of movie which to me gets old very quickly. I hope that is not the case here and that Mr. Scott did not create the story line of this movie based on input from the peanut gallery; yes, us! A story or art should be told as the author/creator intends it to be, not what others suggest. If it fails or does not touch everyone so be it; it's time for a different story based solely on the author’s imagination. I have not seen the movie yet so I'll try not to speculate too much.

I want to see a psychological thriller, not an action movie, but not without action.  A horror film.  Hitchcock did it best.

It then crashed on this planet, which in turn, is the planet from the first Alien movie. The Aliens have escaped & eaten & burst out of all the animals, which made them mutate (seen in Aliens 3) & then they eat & burst out of these humans & again mutate into the Aliens we see today.

They made it look like another bland space movie, because they don't actually know what made movies like that good, they just think,""Oh looks like we haven't used the Aliens franchise for a bit, lets make a mediocre movie we know people will watch!"" and the thing is it will work because people have done it repeatedly in the past, and the majority of people just watch movies to watch them without even thinking if its good or not.  I'm not asking for a triple A movie at the standards of Avatar, but I expect at least something interesting and filled with actual effort and feeling. Screw reboots that reboot just for a cash grab. It hurts the industry, and people are going to give up watching these bland movies. PLEASE SURPRISE ME WITH THIS MOVIE!

2017-05-11T20:10:24,"Mankind's imagination is not limitless. Most things, most ideas, have been explored, shown and rehashed MANY times already since the dawn of cinematography as a form of art and expression. Sci-fi movies had their golden era from the late seventies to the early nineties, and by now most if not all of the tropes and cliches have been used. This is simply another repackaged generic sci-fi movie + Alien franchise + 2017 political correctness (notice the multicultural couples and overabundance of women). Acting in theathers began its decline in the late seventies, and nowadays most theathers show idiotic shows or stand-up comedy. Movies took their place, and now their time is coming to and end as well. Same thing happened with painting and other forms of artistic expression. Videogames are stronger than ever in modern culture because of the niches left empty by cinematography... and even them will eventually cease to attract attention, wither and die. Something new will come to replace them, it's silly to keep churning out sci-fi movies that have no soul and that are there just to make you go ""ohhh!"" and ""AHHH!"". If they can even do that anymore. There's a reason most people from the eighties are nostalgic. It's not just ""nostalgia"", you know... movies back then were just BETTER because they were FRESH.

Promotion and trailer again much better than the result. I don't know why but Hollywood producers and scriptwriters have lost their passion for creating great movies... What I mean by that, is simply the tension created in masterpieces like Alien one and two or other amazing Sci-Fi movies. Feelings as agony or suspense are just missing because characters are set to talk unnecessarily much on their journey. Furthermore, in the movie, there was no true hero I could engage with. In the past we could smell the fear of Sigourney Weaver... but she would risk her own life for this little girl to not be killed by the Aliens. With a child in her hands, she was fighting, trying to escape all through the entire movie. I know that it is impossible to repeat Dan O'Bannon or James Cameron with the amazing Ripley. However real artists can give us the same feeling with a similar story at least. Especially when it’s clear what the audience expects… I don't mean to be rude but it was honestly, a really boring journey except for some min. near the end.

Inspired by Star Wars which still makes a lot of money through sequels,he  thought he could do the same on Alien. Spent hours watching History Channel as a source of inspiration and left the fucking SCRIPT in a hands of  KIDscritpwriters. Never thought about introducing something new,something that could pay Alien a well deserve and proper respect.Bold enough to go far where no one has ever gone before. Instead,this lunatic gives us a shitty conspiracy plot between technology and humankind.Nothing could be more predictable than  that, so they could justify the existence of Aliens,where they came from and what lies beneath their existence. OHHH David created the Alien,but created David? Us!! Really? And who created us? Hummm..I dont know...lets check it out by visiting planets by sending a bunch of yahooo cowboys and saying HELLO to whatever fucking civilization we may find.Maybe we may enjoy being cocooned so the space trip would be worth it,maybe we got raped by black goooss from outter space who knows.. ..bla bla bla bla bla...Bollocks!!!     Thats what it is ..a great mumble jump load shitty crap film. Shitty CGI effects  Terrible and Predictable plot Pointless character development Terrible editing Predictable scary scenes Copy and paste out of Alien Aliens and some Alien 3 scenes Copy and past SCORE SOUNDTRACK ( though i have to say its a good one ) Another 20 minutes landing scene ( filler ) Another bunch of idiots in space ( Cant believe that in the future Humankind will be able to rely 2000 lives in a hands of loses such as those we saw in the film ) David wipes out a civilization the size of Manhathan and they say the entire civilization was destroyed? hahahahaahah !!! Jesus !!! Real States agents will bankrupt in the future  A feel Sorry for Ridley Scott, He lost the helm long time ago and all what I can see now is a director shotting alll directions to the get his share. I have been a Alien fan since I was liquid form sperm inside my fathers balls and I have never been so disrespected my entire life. Alien shaped the person I am today. Helped me understand the shadow inside of the human soul. Made me able to understand the Survival Instinct, the search of purity, the questioning of morality,whats right or wrong, how far we can go as humans and how Science will define our existence and ways of living. It made me the nature of brutality,rape,sex,erotism,life cycle,reproduction, and what we will find out there in space. So many interesting concepts. Some many different types of questioning things.

More entertaining and more exacting than, ""help build our house"" which is easily deniable and like Guardian of the Galaxy, it makes the use of modern music entertaining and helps out a plot point in the film.  And to make it even more shocking at the very end have David as he has  put the two astronauts to sleep and chooses a piece of classical music  to walk alone in the ship instead of picking the classical piece of  music Ridley used in the film, have David select the opening piano of  Styx's Come Sail Away.

2017-08-27T04:03:32,I rented this movie at Redbox and as they ejected the body of their Captain out into space wrapped in probably some cloth that would keep him from breaking down into dust.  What if a large ship had a sickness or collided with that ejected body killing multiple people on board from the impact. They then ejected their dead into space in suits that would keep them intact. That group of dead ejected bodies then become a even bigger mass to dodge for other spacecrafts. And this goes on until the dead kill everybody in space. And the dead rain down on planets after millions of years of collecting debris and ice and dirt form around them and all planets and stars are pummeled with the dead that have turned into asteroids. You know just kind of wondered along with the thought that if this is true. Then earth could be a dead guy. And this galaxy has become a stopped except for the orbiting of dead people that have been dead so long they became planets. Anyway. I'm kind of against space junk. My guess is when people travel deep space (not saying they can or will just saying) and they hear about people being trapped without resupply. They will eat the dead. So space is for cannibals. Which is why I live on a planet in space. Not in space eating humans.,0,0,Jeff Bingaman,u5KPP6lxRVg,-0.026611898202807308,2017-08-27 04:03:32,False,False
