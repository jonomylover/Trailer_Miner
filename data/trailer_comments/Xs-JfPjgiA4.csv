2014-10-16T14:48:55,"For those who are probably wondering why I'm excited to see an albatross, let me explain. In the poem ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" by British poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the main character is a sailor who's going on a long voyage. Along the way, an albatross starts to follow their ship, and they take it as a sign of divine approval. The mariner shoots the albatross and everything that could go wrong does go wrong. So, whenever you see albatross imagery or it's mentioned in a story about sailing, it's alluding to this poem. For example in the opening of Frankenstein (the book), the character Robert Walton is planning to chart the Arctic and in his letters to his sister back in London, he say, and I'm paraphrasing, ""I won't shoot the albatross, so there's no need to worry."" (For those wondering how this plays into the story, when Walton's ship get caught in an ice field, he meets a weary Victor Frankenstein who tells him the story of how he created a monster and has pursued that far north).  (it's a great poem, if you want to read it. it's kinda long - okay it's really long - but still, check it out)",115,36,Morgan P,Xs-JfPjgiA4,0.06597222222222222,2014-10-16 14:48:55,True,True

Thirdly there was no report of hostility between any of the crew members at any time except an incident where a crew member attempted to steal some hard tack.

2015-10-23T18:02:41,"PG-13? So, this should be called ""In the Heart of the Hollywood Bullshit."" The whale sped along and accidentally smashed into the ship -- then, believing it to be a rival male whale, rammed again for the final blow to the Essex and left. The primary story is the crew withering away in lifeboats, guzzling their own urine, and cannibalizing the dead. Those that stayed on the island had an easier time surviving and weren't totally scarred for life from their lifeboat experience. Owen Chase survived but was fucked in the head from then on. I doubt PG-13 will do justice to a very gruesome story. Seeing how Opie is Spielberg Lite, the film will probably go as follows:   We open on Herman Melville reading Owen's ""Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whaleship Essex."" Ramp up the sweeping soundtrack as we head into the film's flashback bulk!! Have the Essex - emphasis on it being a small warhorse of a ship, rickety but still plenty of sail left in her - gallantly embarking on its whaling journey after Owen says goodbye to his sweetheart in a spew of grotesque sentimentality that rivals the ""The Perfect Storm."" The crew attempts to bag a few whales while Owen babbles about philosophy with his buddy, Matthew Joy: ""The sea is life and we are death"" ... ""The whale is us"" ... ""We're just a tiny speck in the universe out here among the ocean's giants"" ... ""Eenie meenie chili beanie!!"" He teaches the young cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, the ropes of sailing; this bond will course in the same retarded, cliched vein as ""King Kong"" (2005): ""Get yourself educated, Jimmmeee!!"" Owen scribbles in his journal about missing his sweetheart -- set to narration and maybe a flashback discussion about having children (and the guilt of how many children he has squirted into napkins). The whale appears and rams the Essex forty times. Owen personally launches 100 harpoons into the whale and dodges numerous lashes of the tail and penis. After witnessing the horror of Hemsworth's acting, the whale leaves and the ship sinks, leaving the lifeboats to drift. PG-13 thirst is quenched with a cutaway to a jar and yellow splashes (they should be method actors and slurp the real shit down), hunger sets in with growling bellies and vacant or anguished stares - sorrowful music amped to scream ""OH THE HUMANITY!!"", a squall with harrowing music that screams ""BOOGITY BOO!!"", the sun bearing down, the sea stretching forever, a mild hallucination from exposure (where he taps into the future, babbling about ""BITE BITE, SIP SIP, DO THE DEEP DISH COMBO MAMBO!!), and a nightmare of the whale returning with Owen's sweetheart stuck in its blowhole (which gives him a violent nocturnal emission that the other crew members have to clean up because he's the captain!!) They reach the island and joyful music trumpets as mostly all resources are exhausted. After battling an army of exploding pygmy cannibals, Owen decides he must get back to his sweetheart!! The lifeboats leave and a few remain on the island, both groups looking at each other to belts of violins. Another squall separates the lifeboats -- Owen must save JIMMMEEE!! Time passes and rations run low or are ruined by seawater, followed by a gut-wrenching moment when Matthew Joy dies -- Cillian Murphy's butt cheeks are too good to pass up, so he cannibalizes his friend (Isaac Cole should be the one cannibalized, but no one's heard of the actor playing him). Maybe Benjamin Lawrence is the ""token bad guy"" in the bunch that argues back and forth like Ernest Borgnine from ""The Poseidon Adventure."" Throughout everything, the young cabin boy keeps his chin up and Owen keeps his Fabio eyes on the prize!! Upon placid water, two adult whales and a few babies peacefully pass and Owen has a moment of catharsis. They are rescued and Owen reunites with his sweetheart and finds out he has a daughter -- he embraces them with a new lease on life set to John Williams or Howard Shore farting into a tuba. Afterwards, Owen profusely masturbates to get all the sea salt out of his system. The cabin boy masturbates too to get rid of his blueballs. Cut to ""Moby Dick"" in bookstores. Superimpose whatever the hell about the other boats and the islanders being saved too. THE END.",6,2,Hellzyead,Xs-JfPjgiA4,-0.000199007116620753,2015-10-23 18:02:41,True,True

2015-11-07T16:29:10,"I read the book, and it is a fascinating story. Being a video story teller, I think Ron Howard must have had many obstacles in making this movie and not because of CGI, but because of the lay out of the story. One of his biggest issues must have been the Demographic audience he wanted to target. This is, relatively, a grown up book, and the whale portion of the story, though the turning point, it is not what the whole story is about, it is only what put them in the position for the real human story. Does Ron tell the story as it was written, or does he dramatize for the big screen? The trailer suggests he dramatizes and does so big time. I can't blame him on this for the whale scene, and secretly, I do want to see that, but I hope the human part of this story is not lost.  If Ron does this movie focusing around the whale, the younger kids watching will like, but the older viewers will say it was a CGI movie. This had to be a tough decision for Ron on who to accommodate. Can he do both? Not sure if that is possible. I am really curious how it will end. Even Spielberg had to bring back the T-Rex at the end Jurassic Park, because that is what the audience wanted to see, but that was not a true story. Ron is known for capturing the humanity in his movies, I can't wait to see if he sells his soul for views, stays true to the book, or has the capability of doing both. In any case, I would not judge Ron's movie making abilities based on one film. I plan to see it in the theaters, and I am really picky to what I go to theaters to view.",2,0,Joe Brennan,Xs-JfPjgiA4,0.035846560846560835,2015-11-07 16:29:10,True,True

I can say for certain that the two biggest reasons why the whales are CGI'd is because you literally can't train whales for film making. They don't have that sense of cooperation, and keep in mind that the main whale, Mocha Dick, the very real albino sperm whale that's featured in this movie, is near non existent in today's waters, so no one can just pluck a big fucking whale like that out of the sea with a snap of the finger. Animatronics would've been a more convincing way to go, and that may be something not shown in the trailers, but also remember that the CGI in trailers always look alot worse than the actual movie. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm still hyped about this film, being directed by Ron Howard for god sake, but for the love of god remember that the CGI is not redundant. it's there for a reason, so stop acting like it's gonna kill the movie.",0,0,HeinkelG2,Xs-JfPjgiA4,0.11204761904761909,2015-12-04 03:22:52,False,True
