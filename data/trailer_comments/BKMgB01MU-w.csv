In that movie, we see an older Bruce Wayne who has been retired from being Batman for many years. We see that Robin suit with the Joker reference on it. Meaning he had to be fairly close to Bruce's age. And if Joker did kill Robin, Batman (especially the serial killer from BvS) would not rest until Joker was dealt with. So if this takes place pre-Batman's retirement, how would this guy know about Superman? If it takes place after BvS, how is Joker still a) alive, and b) young?

And to the Deadshot/Harley romanse situation, it's not happening. Margot Robbie and Will Smith were saying in multiple interviews that there will be some romanse between these two, and why would they spoil the movie like that? No, Harley will just want to get Deadshot on her side. I can also tell by her character in the movie, how she says like ""Come on. G...ot something better to do?"".

I am sorry, but that makeup job still looks too fake to me, and the size just seems off. I just cant get past it. I know that CGI would be worse. I mean, Doomsday proved that to me by now. But I think a bigger actor would have sold it for me. No offence to Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Yes, I totally copied and pasted that. Too difficult of a name for me to remember typing), but I cant help but think that someone like Kevin Grevioux could have given the Croc the stature that he desperately needs. Reminding me of the comics and the Batman Arkham games, its hard to see it. But then again, the acting talent needs to be there too, so I will swallow my opinion til this premiere.

I love love love the jokers voice but quite honestly disappointed in his make up. I also think they did not chose the right actor for Harley at all yes she's pretty but she can not act the part atleast what I saw of the trailors she didn't seem to be crazy enough or like able enough. Hate me all you want I was really looking forward to this movie but now it seems like it's going to be one of the biggest let downs of my year.

I think that the most revealing suit I hacer ever seen Harleen use was the one in Justice League: Gods and Monsters, where the suit is basically a copy of this but a few touches. The most sexy of them all was the one from Arkham Asylum for sure, no one can deny that. The only other reference I have would be from the comic Injustice where, once again, she had a costume while being hot, not the other way around.   Maybe I'm nitpicking but Harley costume sure bothers the actress. I honestly don't see why they had to go the route of over sexualized girl.
