Stop saying ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Judge Me!‚Äù, it only makes people judge you even more harshly. Your teachers judge you. Your sunday school teacher judges you. Your boss judges you. Not only that, they judge you by THEIR criteria, not yours. Every day of your life is an interview, both at work and in social situations. When a job opens up at work that would be a promotion, nine times out of ten, before you even have the formal interview for the job their minds are made up ‚Äì you have interviewed for it every day since you started work there. People rely on those they know and trust, often from within their social circles. When you are out drinking beer with your buddies, like it or not, they are judging you and sizing up your character. When your dream job opens up for you at their company, will they recommend you for it? Their reputation is on the line if you dont workout. If they know you call in sick when you are not really sick, they will think twice about recommending your for a job that requires a reliable person. Everyone judges you. Public figures are always judged, it comes with the territory. A politician running on the platform of family values who is caught in an extramarital affair will be judged harshly, and rightly so. An obese author of a diet book will be harshly judged, and rightly so. Fair or not, people always judge you by THEIR criteria, not yours. Its just the way it is. If you just won the Boston Marathon and head to the beach the next day, somebody is going to think/say, ‚ÄúGee you should workout, you are all skin and bones‚Äú. The way to handle it is not by making excuses but simply to explain how you are achieving YOUR goals. A bad answer for the Boston Marathon winner would be, ‚ÄúYa, I‚Äôm a hard gainer‚Äú. A good answer would be, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a professional long distance runner and adding muscle weight would slow me down‚Äù. If you are obese, when someone makes some negative comment like ‚Äúhave some self control!‚Äú, the wrong thing to reply with is an excuse like ‚ÄúI have thyroid problems‚Äú. A better answer is ‚ÄúI am a football player/Sumo wrestler and being heavy improves my performance‚Äú. Another good answer is that you are quite happy being obese because in your circle of friends, being obese is a positive rather than a negative thing. If you are obese and don‚Äôt want to be, then do something about it rather than making excuses. My website and videos philosophy has always been about using bodybuilding to improve your health, performance, and to make you feel better but many don‚Äôt seem to get that and judge me based upon appearance alone. ‚ÄúEeeeu, Scooby‚Äôs abs looks weird.‚Äù or more commonly ‚ÄúScooby‚Äôs legs are too small‚Äú. People judge me by their criteria, thats fine, but its not my criteria ‚Äì these are my goals. My response is ‚ÄúForm follows function and I do endurance cardio events. I am quite comfortable with my 54 year old physique.‚Äù We are all judged every day of our lives, get comfortable with it. Some people act differently in different situations which can make the judging even more complicated, especially when different groups in your life end up intermingling ‚Äì it‚Äôs much easier to be yourself 24/7. Let people judge away, if you are comfortable in your own skin, it will not bother you.",0,0,Racimuk RR,ZBvK6ni97W8,0.0657106782106782,2014-10-01 00:23:57,True,True

I think this is the best movie because it is the FIRST movie that made me cry. Maybe it was because of the fact that - for sure I am not alone - I saw myself and my dad in this movie. It is hard not to talk to your parents when you love them, but they did something cruel or something you can't forgive easily. My parents had a divorce when I was 8 and of course I didn't know what's going on, so I continued seeing my father. It wasn't same as before, but I just loved my dad so much that I couldn't tell him that I don't want to see him because his new girlfriend doesn't like me and I don't like her. It told him when I was 13 and from then, we were always arguing about everything. He said things that hurt me really much and when I was 14, I decided that this isn't going anywhere, so we stopped talking and I stopped visiting him. I still miss him, but I can't do anything with it, because he chose his girlfriend over me.

2016-10-16T20:44:53,"As someone who has lets say a complicated, bad feel relationship with my dad, this picture really touched me. Yes it's melodramatic and contrived but it's well written, well acted and packs a truthful, emotional and personal punch for me. This movie makes me realise that maybe I should make up for so much lost time before it's too late. But just like hank and the judge in this movie, things are complicated and maybe making up can never happen. Needless to say this is a movie that moved me personally and I hope things work out in the end in my family before it's too late.(SPOILER ALERT INCOMING.) Not ashamed to say I cried at the end when there are finally good, kind words between Hank and the Judge just before the Judge dies. Heartbreaking that the way they should of been with eachother Hanks whole life only lasted too briefly. Hank will never see his Dad again but I hope me and my Dad have kind words that last many years, not just before it's too late.

The court scene at the end, the scene in the kitchen, the hospital scene; I was overall just mezmerized. They did such an amazing job with the movie. Too bad it didn't get as much recognition as it should have. But this was fucking amazing, and it's now my favourite movie ever. Got all emotional and shit, it hit me deep down‚Äî the family issues, quite the unlucky life, all that. It's just so. And Robert did a good fucking job like he always have with his movies.
