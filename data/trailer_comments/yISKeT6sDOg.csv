Obviously there's something wrong with YOU if you're expecting top notch acting and plot from a franchise called ""Fast and Furious"". If you didn't like where they were going with it, why even watch up to this point? You'd think after 6 movies you would've figured out to just not pay any attention to it. The people, like me, who enjoy this stuff aren't expecting anyone to be nominated for Best Acting or to see it on a ""Top 10 most inspiring films of the decade lists"".

Racing was an element, almost a front for Dom and his crew whose real job is boosting trucks in the first FF movie, which means they were street racers 14 YEARS AGO.. And Brian joined the racing under cover to find out who the real culprits were.  So yeah, FF wasn't completely about racing.

2015-03-23T17:15:19,"This movie is going to be amazing and emotional!  There's something I really want to know, and it's the 'story' of the Plymouth Road Runner... So the grey Road Runner appears here in the ending of Tokyo Drift, and Dom says to Sean 'I won it from my friend Han a few years ago' . In Fast & Furious (2009)  the car appears again, and is driven by Letty this time until she has the accident where she gets side-kicked by Fenix. Following the flip over the car explodes...   Nowadays we all know (the real fans at least know it) that Tokyo Drift takes part after Fast & Furious 6 and basically at the same time time as Furious 7 (takes part in the beginning of Furious 7 I think, the part where Han dies)  The ending of Tokyo Drift reappears in Furious 7, so we can see the grey Road Runner...  So my question is:  Where did Letty get the Road Runner? and where did Dom get the Road Runner, which is the same as Letty had in Fast & Furious (2009) and exploded?  I mean if the exact storyline is that Fast & Furious (2009) occurs before Tokyo Drift...  Also in Furious 7 Dom has a Road Runner again, but this time it has another look, Fire Red paint job, black hood, chrome Muscle car style wheels!",0,0,Kev27RS,yISKeT6sDOg,0.04890350877192982,2015-03-23 17:15:19,True,True

2015-04-03T15:18:33,"Saw the movie last night on Times Square. I didn't like it at all. I liked all of the other movies but not this one. I think the problem with this movie is that after Paul Walker died, they scrambled to rewrite it, and you can tell they didn't do a very good job with the writing. The movie was basically a bunch of unnecessary massive stunts, crashes, and explosions, none of which made any sense. For example, flying your car from building to building just to elude a couple of security guards. Really? Why not just jump out of the car and beat them up like you normally do. Or flying your car off the roof of a building to crash it into a helicopter. So Dom Torretto, what do you plan to do after you actually crash your vehicle into the helicopter. And too much martial arts. I don't mind the hand-to-hand fighting but it just went on and on and on that it dragged. I didn't know if I was watching a martial arts flick or a car movie. And it was way too geeky. I don't mind geek, but at least make the geeky stuff realistic. And most of the major stunts of the movie revolved around getting access to a computer chip, which they ultimately never took advantage of. And if that wasn't stupid, the fact that Jason Statham kept mysteriously appearing in places that he should have had no knowledge about made the movie super and utterly ridiculous. I get the fact that Statham found them at Han's funeral, but how did he know to find them on the hijacking mission in the middle of nowhere, and not only that be in the exact spot where everything was going down? Wasn't that supposed to be a secret mission? And how did Statham know to show up at the billionaire party in Abu Dhabi? Is there a Mole on Toretto's team? Or was Statham also looking for the computer chip? NONE of this was discussed. It was just ""oh, there's Statham, let's fight him"", instead of ""how the hell did he know how to get here"". Talk about plot holes. And they just totally abandoned the whole Race Wars theme with the crowd of hot girls, fancy cars, and cheering spectators - except for one little 2 minute scene in the beginning. It was like the producers threw in real quick just for the heck of it, and then added a cameo of Iggy Azalea to make you forget how they totally abandoned that aspect of the franchise. nd cheering crowd is really what made the franchise. The best part of the movie for me was when they parachuted their cars out of the plane and the drove off on the road and got in formation to get that bus. That was SOOOOO episode 1!!!!! The only thing that messed up the scene was Jason Statham mysteriously popping up out of nowhere in a vehicle, like really? How did you know they were there? That was a secret mission in a heavily guarded area, which is why they had to parachute in. How did YOU get it? They did a bad job with this movie.",0,0,Forever Raining,yISKeT6sDOg,0.0543874643874644,2015-04-03 15:18:33,False,True

Um cem número de vezes eles são salvos do nada, isso compete com o excesso de bizarrice do filme. Parece que quem escreveu não tava nem aí com o público, o diretor e a edição do filme ficaram PÉSSIMAS.  Teve pontos bons como o Roman Pierce que tirou umas gargalhadas, a luta com a Ronda, e a homenagem ao Paul. Fora isso... Decepção, parecia que eles tinham vergonha do passado que foi a verdadeira estória do F&F. A gente adora carros e corridas e não vai ao cinema pra ver DRONES, cenas de ""james Bond"". Pra mim consertar a mega cagada cinematográfica que foi esse filme vai ser MUIITO DIFÍCIL. A cena da letty recuperando a memória é RIDÍCULA e dura menos de 1 minuto. Parece que Paul W. vai fazer mais falta do que eu achava. Pra mim o F&F acaba no 6 e vai ser impossível consertar a M.. gigante que foi esse conteúdo. Esse filme impacta, mas morre na praia pq. é só efeitos especiais e violência 97% do tempo...

When you see cgi paul walker you can tell which messed the movie up for me because it hurt me how if looked like crap which I hate to say because I really did like the dude. Furious 7 kinda reminds me of Mission impossible 4 because both movies didn't really have a plot just go here get a girl then get a chip that you didn't need to get in the first place then the bad guy finds you movie over...

2015-04-08T23:43:30,"I have never seen such a bad movie get this rating on metacritic(6/10). This movie is amazingly awful. It makes no sense, the acting is terrible, the dialogue is terrible, and the action is surprisingly terrible (shaky-cam, lack of focus, effects over actual choreography) as well. It really is a shame to waste money on making or seeing this movie.   Amazing foibles: Half CG Paul Walker is like watching a Japanese ""real doll"" placed in an action movie (sorry Paul). The camera angles and dialogue surrounding him is so surreal. I was so distracted by the efforts to pretend he was alive for the whole movie that I couldn't focus on the movie, not that you need to focus to watch this nonsense. Also, the plot makes no sense whatsoever. I can't even describe it. They try to find a device to just track down Jason Statham, yet he finds the crew at every other scene. Also, for some reason they need to drive cars out of a plane to reach a bus transport, yet Jason Statham manages to be at the same place without falling out of plane. Why did they need to do it? They didn't. This whole movie did not need to happen.   Vin Diesel is old, and just rambles on about family and the streets and other nonsense. HE WEARS A WHITE CUT OFF TO HIS OWN WEDDING. Classic Vin...   Also, they go to Tokyo as if there is no time interruption from Tokyo drift, yet the Tokyo drift actor is 10 years older than he was in that movie. They really think the audience is dumb as a couch.   This movie is just a series of scenes of people lining up for the camera and cars doing the same.   ",0,0,TheWarfare07,yISKeT6sDOg,-0.09587542087542085,2015-04-08 23:43:30,False,True

I let it go the first couple of times even the head on crash going around 50mph each and even the car jumping between buildings. But after that i just felt numb to all the action sequences and it just all ended up feeling like a transformers movie without the transforming cars.The only saving grace was the ending but even that lost some of its emotional impact due to the over the top action sequences and very little focus on the characters themselves. I understand its supposed to be over-the-top but in doing so u never feel as though any of the characters are in danger which takes out a lot of the emotional impact the movie would otherwise have.,0,0,Chris Lee,yISKeT6sDOg,-0.0265625,2015-04-24 02:29:29,False,True
