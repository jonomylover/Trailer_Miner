Everything Everything is indeed a book but it came out 9 years after the said Japanese film.  Midnight Sun started filming in October 2015 and was supposed to be released on either 2016 or 2017. While Everything Everything started filming in September 2016 and was released on 2017. Maybe they moved it to 2018 because of the similarity of the story with Everything Everthing. So to end it all, Taiyou No Uta came first and maybe the author of Everything Everything may have seen the Japanese film before making his book and based some parts of it from there but that is only my suspicion.   I've been waiting for this to come out a long time now since the actress in the original film, YUI,  is my fave singer in Japan.

Some people with albinism for example really can't go out in the sun. And that's what made it more interesting for me. Everything. Everything would have been better if they explored her mom's problem a bit more. Like, they could have given the story another point of view, that wasn't in the books. It would piss the book fans off, but it would be a lot deeper and real I think. So now I can talk about what I disliked about this movie: THE PEOPLE WHO DID THE TRAILER PUT THE WHOLE MOVIE IN IT.

2018-02-01T11:58:35,"Since the original movie, Taiyou no Uta, is about 3rd in our emotion-inducing dramas/movies, my sister and I have pretty strong opinion about this remake.  Sore spot about having another Asian remake aside (because Asians do it too), the cast of the remake are gorgeous, and the colours look more brilliant and vivid (maybe due to the ~10 years in between the movies?), and from this trailer it looks like the remake has the makings of a good movie, but overall I'm pretty sad about it. It's understandable that they'd Westernise it and it's probably a good decision, but part of the charm of the original movie is the shyness and awkwardness between the hero and heroine - which is cute especially since they're high school kids in love for the first time. The heroine of the remake, however, seems more natural when she's taking her clothes off in front of the hero and jumping into his arms to kiss him than she does being shy (her bashful acting was... awkward). It kind of takes away a lot of the dynamics of the two for me.  Whatever it is, I hope Bella Thorne is a good singer! Taiyou no Uta is what made me feel in love with YUI's singing (she also writes her own songs, btw). Since Hollywood has so much talent, I hope they find an actress who can also sing well, because that is a HUGE part of who her character is!",0,0,Aishah Rosli,fEskVQgtwaI,0.27713541666666663,2018-02-01 11:58:35,True,True
