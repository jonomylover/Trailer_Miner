The original was about a doctor who found a potion that turns him invisible. Seems cool and even wacky. A FAR cry from this. This seems to be about an abusive boyfriend (which is starting to become horror cliche) who is revived and turned invisible. This seems like the plot for one of those dumbass horror text message stories. Also, this trailer showed more than it needed to. I practically watched the whole movie just now. Here‚Äôs the plot. An abusive boyfriend dies and leaves the girlfriend relieved. However, he comes back and is invisible. She tries to tell everyone and people start thinking she‚Äôs going insane. She then finds out his secret, kills him for good, and gets her revenge. There you go. Don‚Äôt need to watch the movie now. Also the acting. I hated 1:26. That seems like the acting skills a high school freshman has when they didn‚Äôt do their homework. And then there‚Äôs 1:23. This is practically all Blumhouse movies in a nutshell. The actors being unnecessarily creepy when nothing scary is going on. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre implying that what they‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt creepy. Which at first IS creepy. But the more they imply that they‚Äôre not being creepy leads you to believe that what they‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt creepy. Also, this just seems like another ‚Äúall men bad‚Äù kind of story. You can tell because it went from ‚Äúwacky doctor turns invisible‚Äù to ‚Äúabusive boyfriend dies and then haunts his girlfriend‚Äù. All I‚Äôm saying is that I don‚Äôt think this movie is going to be good. Like all other Blumhouse movies before it, it‚Äôs trying too hard to be scary.

Cellia/Kass or whatever her name was also kept saying that he would beat her and abuse her however there was NO FLASHBACKS NO SCENES OF ADRIAN DOING THESE THINGS. We only the couples relationship through Kass's perspective however I'm starting to think that she was the crazy and insane one who kept creating lies?  Second thing was when Kass promised to give Sydney $10k every month for the next year James was just cool with it, like dude we need to see a realistic conversation and reaction.
