If they marry out of the culture they are rejected and their children wander about as DEAD PEOPLE. yet when removed you always will be his FAMILY, but only at insurance check out!!! .. In this culture the movie of the relationships took off bye seeing DAY OF THE LIVING DEAD, WALKING DEAD movies etc.  Although he did not marry he showed his stalker the AMERICAN WOMAN!!! of the WHO!!!  that the relationship would be his death and he would walk around until he has died!!!  Then they showed  the big sick of WHO and it was auto immune STILL's DISEASE.  The girl only needed anti inflammatory medications?  THEN THE RANK OF WORSHIP:  DOCTOR, ENGINEER, LAWYER and many many jobs and  finally ISIS!!!  When you listen to the places they go the subject comes up CATS!!!  Then they talk birds!!!  We know cats seek out birds like 911!!!! Then you think they would have to pass a law to protect the birds?   ALL CATS(muslim based) must wear BELL'S to alert the birds of the cats are  coming!!! Remember, bears will chase you miles and kill you or you play dead like the EU.  Yet cats will watch and hide along your TRAIL and jump out and take you down!!!  children removed  from the family because of insurance demands for their death is money in the purse etc.   how you die is your choice?  In therapy, they learn how to live your life with your rules while saying the children or love one's have their life and there rules which result in early DEATH!!!  bye not following the rules of TIME via religion!!!  Yet if you being set up to take over as drug king pin you discuss CHEESE!!!  the dude said cheese is HEROIN and to make it in the USA with it's drug addiction you have to DO NYC and take if from NORTH CAROLINA FRANK LUCAS and his CHILDREN or the parents of the WHITE GIRL!!!    Since as you know the TALIBAN were students trained in Pakistan and went north to carry out strict laws of RELIGION!!! like john walker lynn!!!  they showed in the movie how Pakistan was formed bye succession from the north portion india!!!   NYC = FRANK LUCAS heroin KING!!!  FRANK LUCAS or cheese king  was FROM NORTH CAROLINA... note the father was from NYC and met the east Carolina university girl working as a waitress and both live in North Carolina !!!   Then dad did a girl in CINCINNATI which during the civil war was the butcher capital of the AMERICA and also GRANT's HORSES name!!!    We know about the English trying to leave Afghanistan and they were massacre in the KHYBER PASS in the SPIN GHAR MOUNTAINS... we know you have to have SPIN on a subject to draw people into the PASS or AIRPORT with simple muslim students with locked exits!!!   as you see as KING of CHEESE, you get the American woman almost like KING EDDIE VIII....   GOT TO KNOW YOUR DOPE and NC FRANK LUCAS!!!  AMERCAIN WOMAN GET OUT OF MY LIFE WITH YOUR GHETTO MACHINE called therapy!!!

The idea was very very good but you sticked too much around the whole thing about ""equality"" and it went tits up that i can tell you. The concept was very good but the actor, he was very very crappy tho. They could have used a latino guy, a chinese guy, an indian guy, and it'd have been so much fun than this shit i just watched. Zoe Kazan is a very good actress, she did an amazing job with 'What if' but now she just fucked it up with this movie. So sad she did such a shitty job at this movie, she used to be very good at romantic comedies. What a waste of her career. Hope she's planning on fixing that. Don't get me wrong, that's what I think and it has nothing to do with races, I don't even care but the guy just talking about his country every single time wasn't necessary at all.
