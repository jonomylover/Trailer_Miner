There is a straight arrow in my pants due to the originality of this concept. James Cameron would roll over in his grave if he knew he could have worked on this movie instead of the 16 Avatar sequels he had planned. If this this isn't 3D we all will riot the streets wearing green. Imagine having an arrow coming right at you in the 3rd dimension. You would die. I'll die if they don't make this movie in 3D. I will purchase the 4K High Definition Box set with the collectable Robin Hood Figurines. It will be on my nightstand next to my bed and I will kiss it goodnight before I go to sleep every night for the rest of my goddamn life. I will say however, that they should have cast Russell Crowe. Why was this never done. Ridley Scott was too busy jerking off to Alien porn that he forgot to cast the God of Crows in a Robin Hood epic that would give any Gladiator to ever exist a sore rectum. The Academy Awards will be ransacked by this film. Robin himself would make an appearance, because this movie is real. Every Academy Award from 2018-3946 would be given to this movie because it would cause every volcano on earth to simultaneously erupt with pure semen. Roland Emmerich could not capture the magnificent scale of these volcano orgasms. He would, however, wonder why he never thought of a disaster movie staring Robin Hood himself to save the day. Who else would the scientists turn to in their time of need, but the King of Thieves? You can't destroy the earth if Robin steals the weather. I can see it now, 'National Treasure 3: King of Thieves.' ""It's simple, we steal the ozone."" Boom. $14 Billion right there. Easily. Nic Cage gets back on top like he has always deserved.
