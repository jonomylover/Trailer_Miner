2014-11-16T16:21:46,"This is a terrible trailer for the film.  I saw a version of this last weekend, only it had a tacked-on scene of Meryl Streep singing at the end.  TOTALLY DID NOT CONNECT WITH THE AUDIENCE!  Absolutely everyone in the room unfamiliar with it beforehand assumed it was a kids' movie, then were completely confused when Meryl showed up singing a slow, melancholy number in close-up.  It just elicited giggles.  Very confusing tone that failed to display the film's strengths (except the cast, perhaps, though they could have done better).  Tips: *Lead with Stephen Sondheim's name, not ""From the director/producer of...""  More people will recognize that it's a musical at the mention of Sondheim than will from oblique indications by anonymous credits! (<-A paradoxical term if I ever had to write one!) *It's a musical!  Put that prominently in the trailer rather than tacking it on literally after the credits!  (Or not at all in this version!)  How do you make a trailer for a musical and not show anyone singing?! *Establish the premise/story, not just a bunch of scenes.  I saw a production of the musical years ago, yet have no idea what this movie is about other than the fairy tale mash-up.",8,9,Alexplorer,L6Yz5BRMGIQ,-0.04316176470588236,2014-11-16 16:21:46,True,True

2014-12-29T22:51:23,"If any of you are thinking about seeing this, here's my review. (I saw the original musical as well) So if you have never heard of Into The Woods before, than it's a story about four well known fairytale characters: Cinderella, Rapunzel, Little Red Ridinghood, and Jack from Jack and The Beanstalk along with a witch (Gothel from Rapunzel) and two new characters the Baker and his wife. The Baker and his wife must go on a journey to collect four ingredients to make a potion for the witch so that they can have a kid; the cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, and the slipper as pure as gold. It's a story about being careful what you wish for and that things aren't always as they seem. It's rated PG, but I wouldn't recommend bringing small children as it's pretty long, and they might get bored. The actors all did a fantastic job, I was especially impressed with the baker's wife, Jack, the baker, and the wolf. Of course Meryl Streep was beyond fantastic, she made an absolutely perfect witch. The singing was incredible, some of my favorites were Stay With Me, On The Steps Of The Palace, Giants In The Sky, I Know Things Now, No One Is Alone, and the Prologue. The Princes absolutely nailed Agony. I had a couple of issues with the movie, mainly all in the ending. The ending was very rushed, even though some songs were taken out. Rapunzel did not die or go insane, but lives happily with her prince instead. The reprise of Agony was removed, although START OF SPOILER Cinderella's prince still had an 'affair' with the baker's wife. END OF SPOILER When Little Red Ridinghood was swallowed by the wolf, the way that was done was a bit cheesy. All in all, on a scale from 1-10, I'd give it a 9. It was very good, especially since Into The Woods is a tough show to put on. (My cousin was the witch in her school's production) Anyways, I hoped this helped!",0,0,Maddi,L6Yz5BRMGIQ,0.11477005073779266,2014-12-29 22:51:23,False,True
