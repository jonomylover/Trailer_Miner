2015-03-19T16:12:38,"I was actually excited for this and the much anticipated Looking for Alaska movie, but after seeing this trailer, my expectations are lowered. It looks like after TFIOS's success, John Green and Fox decided that they should make all his book's movies like that. That is not the case at all. Each of  John Green's books are very different, which is one thing that makes him a great author. The style and direction of TFIOS was a good fit with the book I thought. But Paper Towns was a little different. Less of a cutesy and tragic romance, and more of a teen, coming-of-age mystery. After all, the central themes of the two books are almost polar opposites. This trailer makes it look like the filmmakers butchered their source material to be centered more on romance and threw on a style fit for a mostly younger audience. It's still a little too early to tell (and I may be wrong about the direction of the trailer) but this could ruin the movie for me and many others.

Besides, she's John Green approved. He thinks she can really play Margo, and if he thinks that than we should at least give her more of a chance than just the trailer.

She has the green eyes which were described a lot in the book, which is something people aren't talking about. I think she's beautiful, talented, and a fine pic for Margo. My real problem with this is that Margo seems more badass rather than mysterious and unattainable. But we've only seen a two minute snippet so maybe that came across wrong. But another thing is that the nerdy- ness of Quentin and his friend ( whose name I'm forgetting please forgive me not a fake fan). While needs can be attractive they certainly don't act as cool as these guys did. And while I know the book is about how Quentin thinks he's in love with Margo and thinks he knows her but it turns out he was just in love with the idea of her, I only see romance being portrayed and none of the other stuff.

Cara may not be the margo you wished but the author is John Green and he picked her because she was the Margo he imagined and tried to describe. And i really dont understand you.

I love the book so much (along with LFA) and I couldn't wait to see an adaption being made.  I only disagreed with the ways in which the movie already seems different to the book. And the only thing that makes me a little cynical about the movie (like so many others) is the way Margo is described in the books and how Cara (even though I love her oh so very much) is this well known supermodel and it puts down this image people everywhere have of this wonderful, powerful girl - of a margo roth spiegelman who was still your everyday, average looking girl - and who both blended in and stuck out and who loved mysteries so much she became one. We grew up with image, and we loved Margo regardless, because she was relatable and because she was one of us. She was the most beautiful girl alive, Q romanticised her so much in his head and made her out to be the greatest thing living, he built her up to what he wanted her to be, and she wasn't perfect. But she was still wonderful, and we still loved her.  I get it. But honestly, I just think people need to relax a little more about the casting now that it's confirmed, the trailer is out, and the movie is yet to come. It actually looks good, and I have enough invested into this for me to believe that it will be, that it'll live up to my expectations. Clearly there's nothing anyone can do about the whole casting thing, but right now, rather than anything else, people should focus on the actors' acting abilities. John was clearly impressed with Cara's audition, as an actor, not a random supermodel, and I think we should have faith in that.  I do agree that hollywood should cast more girls who actually look like your everyday, average girl rather than the most impossibly perfect looking people alive. That needs to change.   But Cara as an actor? It's new to her and she's testing it out, and I think people should just give her a chance and give her a break already, because what's done is done. Saying she can't play the character before you've even seen her play it is wrong. Saying that hollywood should cast people who are more relatable to the audience, who fit their character descriptions and who remain true to the character - that is what we should do. Hollywood still needs work, forget margo's casting as an average looking girl. We still need representation of every kind. We still need diversity. It's a work in progress, and we should demand that more as an audience.  Just don't hate on the actors before you've even seen them play the role.",0,0,aaa aaa,rFGiHm5WMLk,0.2818050175944912,2015-03-19 21:09:36,True,True

Sure, I imagined Margo has a short, curvy girl, but that was in the book, this is the film; an ADAPTATION of the book, not a full film that's exactly like the book. Also, Cara plays Margo amazingly, would you rather a short, curvy actress who aesthetically looked exactly like the description of Margo portray her, but do it terribly, or someone who perhaps doesn't look like you imagined her to, portray her amazingly. It's not about what she looks like, how skinny she is, if she has the right hair etc. it's about the character. If you've read the book and you've judged Cara for playing Margo, I hope you're ashamed of yourself because it just shows that you've fallen for the materialistic, stereotypical bs that society poisons you with, which is exactly the message that the book is trying to convey across to you - that life isn't about all the material stuff. *sidenote* what is the song at the end of the trailer?

She may very well represent Margo's personality and all you want, but I'm sure there are other actresses who can also do that and being physically more like Margo is supposed to be.  One of the reasons why I like books is because usually their female characters represent ordinary girls like me... Why in the film it can't be the same way?? and when I say ordinary I mean they aren't like perfect-looking supermodels, I thought this could be a good movie to change that, but then they pick Cara for Margo's role and it's a little upset & disappointing!  I have nothing against Cara, instead is one of the few supermodels who I like, but it doesn't seem right to continue idealizing tall/skinny girls like the normal stereotype of beauty... and I think they chose her more for marketing than anything else.

This book however, was a great read and it was more than just a love story, it was the manifestation of mutual understanding. The story itself was engaging, but the undertones and ideals this book had was what made it remarkable. The philosophies behind the green grass, vessel, and the broken strings really made me sit and think for a while. I never knew John G. was such a skilled writer.

2015-03-22T18:56:56,"They find Margo living in an old dilapidated barn. But instead of being grateful for them finding her, she reacts to their arrival as an unexpected disturbance and begins to scold them accordingly. Margo had not intentionally left any of the clues they used to find her, and states she did not want to be found. Angry at her lack of gratitude, Radar, Ben, and Lacey leave and spend the night at a motel. Gradually, Q realizes that the image of her that he had been creating was as fake as the one she had been showing everyone else. He grows furious at her for wasting their time and worrying her family but she argues that he just wanted a troubled girl he could save. Ultimately, Q comes to accept that it was unfair to expect her to be more than just a person, and she can't be blamed for being as imperfect as everyone else. After they continue to talk things over, she decides to go to New York City. They briefly kiss and Q wants to stay with her but it's implied that he will return home with his friends in the end, possibly to reunite some time in the future, but it is ultimately left ambiguous.",1,0,Hammerzeiterrrr,rFGiHm5WMLk,-0.06424242424242424,2015-03-22 18:56:56,True,True

There is a tactic you can implement to get impeccable 20/20 vision naturally without the use of glasses or contacts. When someone breaks their arm do they wear a cast forever? No way, The arm heals and eventually goes back to normal. You may not know this but the eye is the strongest muscle in the body, So why is it that when your vision gets bad do they put you in a permanent cast without any hope of removal? The eye CAN and will heal itself if given the proper treatment.

Glasses are not good for your eyes they actually make your vision even more harmed than even before you began wearing them. There is a scheme you can forward to get crystal clear 20/20 vision naturally without the use of glasses or contacts. When someone breaks their arm do they wear a cast forever? Of course not, That part of the body completely replenishes and eventually goes back to normal. The eye isthe strongest muscle in the body so why is it when it is harmed and cannot function properly (Imperfect or blurry vision,) do we wrap them up in a permanent cast? The eye CAN and will heal itself if given the proper measures of care.  Listen everybody, This is  crucially important so please do yourself a favor and go and check this out because it is true you can get perfect eyesight back and toss your expensive contacts and hard to keep up glasses out the window for the rest of your life",1,1,Get Perfect 20/20 Vision Naturally,rFGiHm5WMLk,0.04601449275362319,2015-03-24 18:02:07,True,True

The Trailer Doesn't Show the actual ending and Most Important messages and Ideas of the Story, but i think That's good because Like this it Doesn't really Reveal anything .just as in the Book Q romantisizes Margo in the beginning But as the Story Goes on something in his mind begins to Change and he realizes that She is not Like the Perfect picture he Used To See in his Head, but that She has flaws and cracks just like everything Else  does too. Margo is just a normal person, who struggles and Makes mistakes and She May Seem like s miracle to him but She is not more of that than Any other person.

I enjoyed the movie version of TFIOS. They did an excellent job for once on that front, but a part of me feels like these movies are unnecessary. They're great books; John Green has outdone himself and created plots with deeper meanings and characters that are relatable in some way or another. But why Hollywood-ize them? Sure, to make money, to enlarge the franchise of these books, to cater to people who don't like reading, and so on. But I find, for these specific John Green books - as well as a few other books turned movies out there - you can't get what the book is trying to make you feel into a movie. I don't know if I'm making sense, I doubt I am. And I realize producers and directors have to make cuts, add things, and whatnot to all book-to-movie type deals. But these John Green books are so much better as just that: books. Why Hollywood-ize something that has so many different meanings to so many different people across the world? You're taking that special magic out of it and putting whatever Hollywood deems appropriate. It bugs me, and this is just my opinion. It's cool that they want to make this into a movie, don't get me wrong. But again, I find it unnecessary for such a book as this.  Hopefully this makes some sense.

The roadtrip was originally just Q, Ben, Lacey, and Radar. No Angela was included, why is she there now? From what I remember from the book, Radar called Angela, or something, and told her he was going on a roadtrip to find Margo? I need an explanation for all of this. I'm also a little upset that they aren't in graduation gowns, I could be getting a little ahead of myself and that could be from a different stop from in the book but I was so looking forward to that.",0,0,brandi,rFGiHm5WMLk,0.12361111111111112,2015-05-04 16:37:25,True,True

Margo being like a paper girl and leaving clues and being a mystery to many people made me think of someone I know. Nat Wolff's character was thoughtful and sweet. I could relate to Nat Wolff's Quentin character not giving up on Margo and staying the course and seeing things through. There are also some memorable lines in this movie. The music is great. This movie will make you want to go on a fun & enlightening road trip. You will think of Paper Towns and Agloe, New York. And you will be thinking of Pokémon and wanting a black Santa figurine after watching this movie. Cara Delevingne is pretty. I love her natural full eyebrows. Nat Wolff is a sweet guy.

Only wanted freedom, From what she felt were puppet strings.  She longed to be a bird. That she might fly away. She pitied every blade of grass For planted they would stay.  She longed to be a flame. That brightly danced alone. Felt jealous of the steam That made the air its only home.  Some say she wished too hard. Some say she wished too long. But we awoke one autumn day To find that she was gone.  Some say she wished too hard. Some say she wished too long. But we awoke one autumn day To find that she was gone.  The trees, they say, stood witness. The sky refused to tell. But someone who had seen it Said the story played out well.  She spread her arms out wide. Breathed in the break of dawn. She just let go of all she held...  And then she was gone.  -this poem from ""as told by ginger"" remind me of margo",0,0,Grace Camacho,rFGiHm5WMLk,0.0796296296296296,2015-08-11 16:35:41,False,True

Because tbh if you take the story literally and just look for the explicit moments of joy, fun, (maybe nostalgia), drama, comedy etc. Then it's bad. It's not a happy ending, there isn't much of those moments clearly (the movie tries to enhance it to fit a wider movie audience but still). But life isn't like that, I see the book as more educational, a chance to learn. And some people either don't like that or don't see it, thats why I don't think it was a popular film/ book at the time because honestly it was my worst John Green book, and now its one of my favourites.",0,0,THG _,rFGiHm5WMLk,0.03666666666666667,2018-12-10 20:41:55,False,False

When this movie came out my friend and I had just booked our trip to Europe. It was going to be the biggest trip I’ve taken in my whole life. We felt this movie would be a good ‘travel’ or ‘road-trip’ movie to get us into the spirit and we weren’t wrong. I enjoyed it.  Tonight my younger sisters wanted to watch this. I haven’t seen it in years and when it ended I was overwhelmed with feelings of nostalgia - a combination of remembering the good times in Europe and the sadness of it being in the past. Since Europe my life hasn’t been the same. I’ve been a little unhappy and I’ve struggled to capture the happiness I felt when I was traveling.   Watching this movie made me feel so bittersweet because it connected to a certain memory, but the movie itself with the story about friendship, leaving high school behind, bonding with friends before life inevitably changes, and traveling outside your comfort zone made me feel so much at peace. Like people said, this movie strangely enough made you think about life, moving on and letting go. I needed that.",0,0,D Nov,rFGiHm5WMLk,0.07562030075187968,2019-04-18 16:09:54,False,False
