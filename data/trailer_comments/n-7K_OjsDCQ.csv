Evellark, enven if it's not real  So, so, so. I CRIED SO HARD. This trailer is amazing, despite ¬†some negative points like the huge spoil of the parachute scene, I mean, they showed an explosion with Katniss on a truck, then they show people with parachute while Katniss is on the truck, then they show the children trying to catch 'em. Are they serious ? The mutts..wasn't it supposed to be a surprise ? I mean they showed half of the scene... Katniss doesn't look much damaged. And she is not supposed to be so close to the barricade, and here she's just in front of it ! And the entire teaser trailer is in this one I mean one or two scenes is okay, but the entire teaser ?  In conclusion, I love this trailer, it's amazing and marvelous and all, but there is too much spoil for me. They show too much Capitol scenes, so Evellark shouldn't be in the trailer, neither the mutts and the parachutes.¬†  But there are a lot of good stuff though, like Tigris, I couldn't picture her well in the book but here she's very good. The lizzards, that I couldn't imagine at all are also reallt good (a little too human but really good). Snow is perfect as usual and the warfare looks good.

2015-07-24T10:41:03,"No point in watching the movie because I have it summarized below:  Katniss, her sister Prim, and her friends Finnick and Gale all reluctantly adjust to a highly structured life in the underground District 13, which has been spearheading the rebellion in Panem. Feeling manipulated, Katniss eventually agrees to act as ""the Mockingjay""‚Äîa poster child for the rebellion‚Äîbut only on the condition that District 13's President Alma Coin vows to grant immunity to all of the past Hunger Games tributes, including Katniss's friend Peeta Mellark and Finnick's lover Annie Cresta, and to reserve for Katniss the right to personally kill Panem's President Snow once he is captured.  Katniss and the rebels learn that Peeta is alive and is being tortured at the Capitol in an attempt to demoralize and control Katniss. When a rescue team succeeds in extracting him, they discover that Peeta has been ""hijacked""‚Äîa brutal form of brainwashing involving the use of Tracker Jacker venom that induces extreme fear. Peeta has been programmed to hate and fear Katniss. After he attempts to kill her, he is kept restrained under heavy guard at all times as the rebel medics seek a way to restore him to sanity.  A controversial strategy proposed by Gale wins a decisive victory at District 2, readying the rebels to launch a final campaign against the Capitol itself. Katniss and her propo team (a film crew recording her squad for rebel propaganda) are deployed on a trivial assignment to the Capitol. President Coin has sent Peeta along on the mission even though he is still dangerous and unpredictable. Katniss believes Coin wants her dead because she is difficult to control.  While filming in a purportedly safe Capitol neighborhood, the team's commander, Boggs, is killed. Subsequently, during intense urban warfare that involves Hunger Games-like monsters, most of Katniss' team mates, including Finnick, are killed. Katniss presses on alone towards President Snow's mansion. As Katniss reaches the mansion, a hoverplane drops parachutes carrying bombs that explode among a group of trapped children. The rebel medics (including Katniss' sister Prim) rush in to help the injured children but in a deliberately inhumane strategy, a second wave of firebombs explodes, taking out the medics. Prim is killed and Katniss sustains severe burns, but the rebels succeed in taking the Capitol.  During her recuperation, Katniss becomes deeply depressed over her sister's death and confronts prisoner Snow. Snow claims that Coin orchestrated the bombing that resulted in Prim's death, persuasively arguing that Coin made it appear to be Snow's work in order to turn his supporters against him. Katniss realizes in horror that the strategy used to kill the medics had been developed earlier by Gale. When Katniss confronts Gale about his possible involvement, he merely expresses uncertainty. Katniss becomes convinced that rather than establishing a republic governed by representatives from each of the districts, Coin intends to assume Snow's power and maintain the status quo.  On the day Snow is to be executed, President Coin asks the remaining Hunger Games victors to vote on punishing the Capitol just as the Capitol punished the Districts: by holding a final Hunger Games that will target the children of the Capitol's leaders. Katniss silently reflects that this is exactly the same evil the Capitol committed when the last rebellion failed. Then, she votes ""yes‚Äîfor Prim."" Haymitch is the only one who understands her hidden meaning. They proceed to the execution, where Katniss is to shoot Snow. As she readies her bow, Snow flashes her one last smile, reminding her of his promise to always be truthful to her. Katniss silently agrees and, making her decision, she raises her bow and shoots Coin instead, killing her. Katniss immediately attempts suicide, but Peeta stops her and she is arrested during the ensuing riot. After the riot, Snow is found dead. Katniss is ultimately acquitted of Coin's murder by reason of insanity, and she is relocated to the ruins of her home in District 12.  Months later, Peeta and some other District 12 natives also return there. Peeta has gradually recovered the memories of his love for Katniss. Katniss embraces her love for Peeta, recognizing her need for his hope and strength. Together, they write a book in order to preserve the memory of those who died. Peeta still suffers flashbacks from his hijacking and Katniss still wakes up screaming from nightmares. By helping overthrow Snow and assassinating Coin, Katniss has preserved the possibility of Panem transitioning to a representative form of government, but at a tremendous personal cost.  In the epilogue set 20 years later, Katniss and Peeta have two children. The Hunger Games are over for good, and the children represent hope that future generations will benefit from the sacrifices of their parents. Katniss dreads the day her children learn about their parents' involvement in both the Games and the war. When she feels distressed, Katniss plays a comforting but repetitive game: reminding herself of every good thing she has ever seen someone do. The series ends with Katniss' somber reflection that ""There are much worse games to play",0,0,Jameson Koolio,n-7K_OjsDCQ,-0.036807359307359316,2015-07-24 10:41:03,True,True

2015-07-25T12:07:11,"I caught an interview with Donald Sutherland where he was interviewed about these films. And the woman interviewing him asked something like: ""what advice would you give to people wanting to start a revolution?"" And instead of saying: ""look, i'm just an actor, and these are just movies"" he unthinkingly just repeated an idea from the film and said: ""find a leader"".  And it got me thinking, apart from the fact that 90% of hollywood actors seem to be nasty dumb socialists, these movies really have a horrible political message.  They're an insight into the fantasies of social democrats and how these people see themselves as rebels, when in actual fact you can tell they idolatries the state, and violence, and are motivated mainly by a confused resentment.   These films seem to me like a cross between Mein Kampf and a juvenile John Green romance.

Nobody else had a fucking clue. And now everybody's jumped on the Hunger Games bandwagon saying the movies are amazing! They aren't nearly as good as the books! The Hunger Games trilogy in my opinion should have been an 18 rating for ALL films but because they weren't they are ridiculously tame. In the books, it is terrifying what Katniss has to go through, but in the movies it looks like nothing!

I finished the first book and watched the movie in a fork and screen movie theater and was a bit scared of the mutated dogs. and then finished the next two during the summer and I finished it both books in four weeks (I was also in summer camp) and from there I kept up with the news and trailers and for both catching fire and mockingjay pt 1 i was first in line rereading the book the first day, and first showing that the movie came out.

She has bruises all over her neck from his attack and her eyes are looking at something rectangular (the glass window?)   AT 0:35 there are two people. Could this be Katniss and Peeta's kids? The scene looks very calming and for those of us who have read the books, we know that everything that happens after Katniss leaves District 13 is just war; this scene is out in the woods, too. I have a feeling this may be the epilogue scene or if Peeta and Katniss are alone and he asks her‚ÄîPeeta: ""Real and not real?"" Katniss: ""Real.""  AT 1:53 she may be in district 2. This is the scene where she refuses to kill people from The Nut , throws her bow and arrow, makes a speech and then gets shot.   AT 1:58 Bye-Bye president Sn‚Äî Coin? Damn.

Instead of simply slaughtering the shit out of the ""terrorists"" attacking them?   Any normal dictatorship would have simply killed Katniss in the first movie anyway. ""Oh, you both want to die? No prob, we simply execute you now, because: that's the whole point of the Hunger Games, that we CAN do anything we want, even choosing two teens out of each district and letting them fight each other to the death and you still won't do anything at all about it.""  Later the Capitol had many more simply chances to kill Katniss without a problem. Or capture and drug her into a zombie following their lead. Or just use their ultra technique and generate videos of her doing anything they want, for example slaughtering children of the Capitol or eating poop or whatever.  Instead they ruin their own city with ridiculous traps. o_O  Come one, you could at least TRY to put some sense in it. I mean, you copied battle royal anyway and this made much more sense, putting misbehaving teens into a sick fight to the death, so that all others will behave and try to be good to not end like this.

2015-11-21T18:28:40,!! SPOILERS !! Honestly the whole Prim death scene was quick and like nothing even happened. i mean i liked it i just wish they did it it like i though they would. Prim and Katniss running towards each other as the bombs explode. I get that the bomb hit Katniss I wish they had made her a little bit more beat up. SHE WAS BARELY BURNED. The MOM showed no emotion at all of her dead daughter when she was tending to Katniss in the hospital. The MOM was barely even in this movie and when she was she was quiet not saying a thing. WHY DIDN'T THEY DO A SCENE WHERE THEY BURIED PRIM IN A SPECIAL SPOT AND THEN HAVE KATNISS FIND THE PRIM'S CAT HER GRAVE. AND THEN AFTER HER HUNT SCENE SHE FOUND PETA PLANTING SOME PRIM ROSE FLOWERS AROUND HER GRAVE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A NICE TOUCH AND BRING MORE EMOTION AND CARE INTO THE EPIC CONCLUSION. Overall the film got a 10/10 its just that last part. I read the book and that whole scene where it shifts into a fantasy when Katniss turns into like an actual MockingJay and Prim does too. I read it a while ago but that would have been emotional and cooler but confusing for people who didn't read the book. AND did Katniss name her kid PRIM???? There was no mention of her kids name. What about Gale? What happened to him??? In the book he marries the daughter of the District 12 Governor or something. BUT STILL there was nothing at the end for Gale. WAS THERE EVEN AN END CREDITS SCENE I DIDN'T STAY FOR THAT.

He asks one of his advisors to ask what we should be toasting and the advisor says ""the death of Mockingjay"" and he says ""No, she's still alive and it's not over"" and some other stuff, then after everyone at the big round table drinks the man that says she's dead dies from poison in the wine planted by Snow's people..the Rebels send their best swat team to the Capitol to kill Snow, but he boobie traps the entire Capitol and they go underground, but he's got these humanoid large mouthed fanged no eyed bat creatures to try and kill them, it incorporates a fast zombie movie sequence of shooting and biting.  Snow just so good at being bad!  At the end that Moore bitch becomes Queen and Snow tells Candice(now I remember) that that Moore woman planned the parachute bombs on the capitol people.  At the new leader confrence, Juilanne ,she wants to start her own Hunger Games with the Capital people's children, then Mockingjay(JLaw) says that's a great idea and fakes it and when she's about to assassinate Snow, she points her arrow to that Julianne bitch and Snow laughs as Candice kills the Moore woman Queen and then Snow  gets pummled by the Rebels. Candice  goes home and Peeta's already beat her come to plant primerose and they have 2 little kids. I didn't like it that much because I wanted more Snow scenes.  Peeta's always crying and having mental lapses on who side he's on too which is weak. That Hemsworth guy, I hope he doesn't something great cause I don't wanna see these be his last great movies, but they never did him right through this whole series and at the end JLaw kinda dismisses him..""Goodbye"" when he's about to cry..I thought that was a bitchy scene for her to act that way, but Peeta was a bitch through all this too.  I hope all these younger actors find better parts and more loving characters than this twisted movie series for mean hater types.  I kinda didn't like this whole thing, I mean there was never enough love from anyone.  Everyone was kinda mean through the whole thing.  Oh and at the end Candice epitomizes the whole movie by screaming and going off on her little sisters cat(really?!? yea, that's what I'm thinking).  Just a bunch of people being mean to those less powerful than them..ugly movie series if you ask me.

2015-11-28T00:12:41,"Just saw hunger games Mockingjay part two. Honestly it was a good movie but your chain somethings from the book. In the first part I thought it was kind of boring because for me I like to see action action action but that was OK. So I thought Gail was being kind of selfish. I think deep down inside he knew that Katniss didn't really love him the way she loves Peter but he wanted to make himself believe that. There were moments when he was trying to get Katniss away from pita and also he was giving her weird looks when ever she had moments with him. At first cat miss and pita slow was just a spectacle for the capital for the hunger games but it soon turned out to be real feelings for him and I'm happy that Katniss chose the person who She truthfully loved in the end. Next, President CO I N. I knew she was power crazed from the start. I mean think about it. Why was she so eager to go into the capital and aluminate President snow? Because she wanted to take his place, Like President snow said. And when she made that plan with everyone to take the capital children and do a revenge hunger games with them? I'm not gonna lie. I want to see how that turned out, but when you think rationally, The reason why she was killed in the end is because if she really did do that hunger games with the capital children the wars would still continue and President snow dying would do absolutely nothing. That is why ultimately, Katniss had to shoot an arrow through her heart. It was just going to keep going in circles and everyone would just have to keep killing for president snowexactly what he wanted. Now the matter of Finnick dying: üò©. When finished died I'm knocking ally I almost cried. He was a good character, But since this was the series finale movie, the good characters always die. All I was thinking is that Annie and her baby would be alone. Next, the matter of prim dying: it's not that I didn't care but haven't you noticed that in all of the series the young people never make it to the end? And people were saying that Katniss had no emotion when she died, but I know Katniss was sad on the inside but she was too invested in everything that was going on. She didn't really have time to grieve. She had to finish the rebellion once and for all and then grieve afterwards. Now the matter of President Snow: he truthfully is a monster inside and out. One of his general said that Katniss would die from her own arrogance, but in the end it was President snow that die from his own arrogance, and he was also sick with those disgusting cold sores in his mouth. So in the end he died while coughing up his own blood, and the people attacked him. Well, so much people died in the end and there was so much emotions and so many things going on but in the end, the true end, everything was happy. Pita and Katniss finally headpiece for once in a very long time. The movie never showed what happened to Gail in the end but I'm guessing by the telling of what people said about him, He married and important person's daughter and I guess he was happy. And cat miss and pita's kids were so cute. I like that moment in the last scene of the movie when Katniss was talking about nightmares with her baby girl. that was cute. That's all I have to say. Good movie. Not perfect but all the actors and actresses did a good job,and in the end everything was alright. üëçüëåüòÇüòèüòÄüòèüòÇüëåüëç",3,2,Rachael Johnson,n-7K_OjsDCQ,0.17861890589569157,2015-11-28 00:12:41,False,True

In the development Katniss starts to see that both sides lacks of humanity, . In the book the war comes so dark that she¬¥s consumed by vengeance. And If you see the scenes of her getting ready for Snow's execution she hides in her mockingjay suit a Night lock pill which she's traying to grab it after killed Coin but Peeta came to stop her, so she never looked into a new beginning, cause one might  change the face but corruption always breaks through in every system.  I love this part because is a game of choices and consequences, Johanna told her accurately ""You have to sacrifice yourself"" and this make sense cause Katniss lost her sister so she had to pay a huge price in order to decide which enemy would die (Coin or Snow),. She decides Coin rather than Snow cause she wanted only payback, and Snow dies by the consequences of his acts over people. Also the book meant to show that in reality there's no a fully happy ending if you wore the clothes that inspired such violence, always there¬¥s some bagage on your shoulders, that's why she never gets away from her nightmares.",1,0,Eduardo G√≥mez,n-7K_OjsDCQ,0.17587412587412585,2016-06-03 04:48:24,False,False
