I thought this was gonna be a _prequel_ for the longest time (like the last 2-3 years I've been hearing about it), the I saw Bruce Willis (or apparently his character's ghost in the mirror) at 2:12 say ""Don't avenge me, Nancy."" So he's still dead in this one, and she's out for blood, along with Mickey Rourke's badass anti-hero Marv apparently being back with a vengeance (YES - _SO_ glad they brought him back!), and apparently Jason Gordon-Levitt, too - _awesome._ The soundtrack sounds like it rocks, too. I know it's a little early to say, but... I think this might be a good one, guys. Definitely see-it-in-the-IMAX kind of material. Hell, I'd watch it in 3D - even if it's mostly only in black and white. This looks like it might be one of those rare sequels where they don't screw the pooch.

Lady Gag is terrible as usual. Machete Kills was a piece of shit, and a huge departure from the first. I hope Sin City 2 won't be the same. Sin City is a masterpiece in it's own right, I've been waiting for this for years, but I'm a bit nervous. I'll be there on opening night with baited breath.

2015-08-13T03:25:31,"This movie was a colossal disappointment. I was so excited for this movie and it disappointed me, and movies don't disappoint me often. Two things are what screwed up this movie for me: 1. Jessica Alba and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's stories were completely unnecessary and weren't even based on the comics. 2. Dwight not replaced at the end. At the end of the Dame segment was suppose to have Dwight look so different you couldn't tell who he was due to his plastic surgery, but since Clive Owen was unavailable so they continued with Josh Brolin. It would've been better if they just got another actor for the ending of Dame, sure would've respected them better. Because they played it off like it was a miraculous change but it wasn't, you could tell it was Josh Brolin a mile away.",0,2,WeylandYutaniInc91,IQcFnGGZxDg,0.02999999999999998,2015-08-13 03:25:31,False,False
