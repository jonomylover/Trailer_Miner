Same with the Insidious, the movie was simple with no senseless scary ghosts appearing contrasting to the storyline. One other movie which has intrigues me right now is The Witch.

He and Maurice Grosse were the true investigators, virtually living with the family for over a year.  The Warrens just breezed in and out for a day.  This film seems to take a lot of liberties.  There was no nun, no inverted crosses, no sticking to the ceiling etc.  There were enough remarkable events in the true story (Janet allegedly passing through a solid wall for instance). I don't see why they had to make things up for the film.  Still, it looks like great cinema, but if you really want to get the real scoop, read the book.

The only things that can scare me in this movie are the jump scares(the most basic type of scare), but I expect most of them because they're so obvious. Needless to say, I'd still rather build a house than move in an old one. I don't believe in spirits, and neither am I particullarly religious, although I'd prefer not to discuss my beliefs, but I don't want to stumble into any supernatural things(which I believe are VERY real, although not in the inverted-cross-demon-sin-devil way, which sadly still seems to be the norm). Bye the way, here's a Pro-Tip on how NOT to get scared by ANY horror movie: Just imagine you're a critic watching it for a review. Focus on the camera-work, script, story-line, acting, special fx, anything that helps ease your fear. And make sure to bring a friend, you can take comfort in knowing that they're scared and you're not!(or at least you think you're not).",2,0,Max Jordan,VFsmuRPClr4,0.06461309523809523,2016-05-04 21:38:34,True,True

2016-05-20T19:23:12,"I'm so tired of scary movies resorting to ""pop"" scares, where something can only scare you if it pops out and makes you jump. There used to be an art in horror movies where the scares were provided by the sense of dread and terror associated with the scene, back when movies showed objects moving into peculiar places, or when sounds grew louder and such, now everything is boom! something jumps out, then ahh! something is in a reflection, theres no art in it anymore. I don't think filmmakers know how to properly scare people anymore. I kinda liked the way the first Insidious movie was made though, there wasn't too many pop scares, there was a lot of creativity in their method of creating terror. The Babadook comes to mind as a perfectly done horror movie.  Another thing about these conjuring movies is that its well known that the Warren couple were hoaxers and liars. Even people originally claiming to have a haunting had disagreed with how the warrens seemed to add details to their story that didn't actually happen. And for goodness sake's, the real Annabelle doll was a raggedy Anne doll, thats what made her so scary was that Raggedy Anne dolls were in stores everywhere and people were afraid they'd pick up an Annabelle for their child.  I'm not a hater of this movie, its just that I wish scary scenes made sense, but audiences don't seem to mind that the movies don't make sense, as long as they get their fill of the Jack-in-the-box scare method.",29,24,Alex the Railroader,VFsmuRPClr4,0.022058823529411763,2016-05-20 19:23:12,True,True

2016-06-09T23:46:35,"THE CONJURING 2 - Movie Commentaries & Reviews by: Alvin Sebetero Spoiler Level : VERY MINIMAL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The very 1st Conjuring movie made a very huge impact around the globe and many people even considered it as the Best Horror movie in history, including myself. So, the moment that they announced that the sequel will happen, expectation from people is really high. And how did the sequel did? --- I believe it certainly did very well too. I never expected the sequel to be so good. I don't want to compare which is best among the two because both are two different stories but the movies are both beautifully made and beautifully executed. What I loved about the sequel are: * The Characters - For both movies, what makes the Conjuring really good is how they were able to make the viewers feel connected with the Warren couples and the family involved. Every character in this sequel played their role perfectly. * The Story - The flow of the story is very clean and very detailed. The fact that it is based on a true story made it even better. And actually, the movie was very, very realistic when it comes to how they act to situations. There are very emotional moments that made me tear a little. There are funny moments, romantic moments and a lot of well-executed shock and terrifying moments. Another story that made me emotional is the story of the spirit of Bill Wilkins, it will make everyone realize the sadness of unexpected death. * The Values - This may be a horror movie, I would suggest this to be viewed by the whole family even the children. There are a lot of values to be learned such as valuing each members of your family and no matter what happen, be strong and fight for each other. The importance of life and how we should appreciate each and every moment. This movie is really unexpected for a horror movie. You will come out of the cinema happy and will definitely say, ""What I paid for is all worth it"" and I myself would even watch it again. The best moment is experiencing it with other viewers in the cinema. I never experienced the viewers to react that way and how loud they screamed, all the cursing and the reactions. It only shows that the movie is very, very effective and warning --- it may consume all your energy.",19,5,Alvin Sebetero,VFsmuRPClr4,0.2956322751322751,2016-06-09 23:46:35,False,True

(It's not like, ""Hey, this is my name, you can use it to kill me."" MEH -_-) 4 How did the Demon possess Bill? (I mean it makes sense if she possesses human, but possesses the same spirit?

2016-08-05T22:42:36,"I wanna say something to anyone going to watch this movie. It is great until the warrens get involved. Iam almost immune to being scared of a movie but i must say, first hour i guess, off the movie i was a bit scared and jumpy. Something i havn't been in a very long time from movies. Which i was super happy about. But it all went down the drain when the warrens got involved. Because when they get involved it turned in to ALOT less scary and more into action/drama. I wasn't scared at all as soon as they got involved with the whole ordeal. Because it turned more into drama/romance between the wife and edd and how she had seen his death and was so afraid he would die and wanted to rescue him and he was all heroic like, it just went to shit. Btw these are no real spoilers, the death scene comes super early, i think u see it within the first 10mins of the movie. If they had kept the creepyness and how scary and hidden the main boogyman was, it would have been alot better. So less burst down every door in the house and more mystery and a more ""clever"" way to find the solution and the bottom off who the boogyman is and using more clever ways to beat him more than ""spoiler"" knowing the guys name and say i banish u to hell and done.   So my tldr: great movie till the warrens get involved, you will be scared until then, so if you only there for scary part, just watch until the warrens get to the house then end the movie.

The Conjuring 2 works very well whenever there's nothing scary going on. The scenes in England have a gritty kitchen sink feel to them, the young girl who sees everything is a great actress,  and Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do a fine job of making a couple of real-life nutcases seem likeable.  The rest is just discounted jump scare after cheap jump scare. The same shit we've seen in horror films for far too long now.  The only people who might conceivably find this exciting are religious people, for whom seeing an evil nun is unthinkable, people who are afraid of naughty pensioners who are dementedly guarding their slippers, and very young children (but they're scared of everything, so they don't count).  The first film wasn't great. But compared to the usual trash, it did have a couple of effective scenes, and it did a good job of building up a foreboding atmosphere.  That's all gone this time around. This is Eastenders meets Ghosthunters, and it's every bit as bad as that sounds.

Also the power lines were damaged probably due to the fallen tree, and we had no power that day. So me and mom lit candles and i still can't imagine how i went to kitchen that night to get food.(mom was tired and slept all the night). And i finished dinner and went back to my room and placed the candle near my bed's window. And while i lied down on my bed, I really felt like Valak was  standing in the dark corner behind my bed. I chatted on messenger and whatsapp with my cousin but she fell asleep fast. So i was left with no choice but to go into sleep which i found the most difficult thing to do.

2017-08-28T15:32:04,"While I really enjoyed this movie, I feel like it wasn't nearly as scary as the first one, and it wasn't nearly as scary as the premise would make you think, especially with James Wan on board.  I feel like this movie went for a more...action/fantasy kind of feel.  Even the actual scary scenes...didn't feel HORROR, it felt ""awesome"", like ""damn, this demon is badass"".  It felt like they were trying to show the demons front and center in order to build up their cinematic universe.  I think they spent too much time juggling the three villains (even though the old man wasn't a villain, he was portrayed as such for the majority of the movie) to try to build their universe more and I think it makes the film feel disjointed, and it gave it more of a fantasy/action feel.  While this is cool, I do hope they stick more to the tone of the first Conjuring and Annabelle Creation rather than the tone for this movie, as I feel like it was a little bit off.  It felt a little bit too close to a superhero movie in the way that the villains kind of teamed up and the Warrens were kind of like superheroes.  I expect the Crooked Man movie to have more of a fantasy tone to it, which is totally fine and understandable, but the Nun movie better be like the first Conjuring, as the Nun is a genuinely scary character.  The tone that Conjuring 2 used should be saved for an eventual ""team up"" film.  The Conjuring 1, Annabelle and Annabelle Creation had a pure evil tone throughout, and i felt Conjuring 2 was sorely lacking in this aspect.  It's like they kept the horror elements there, but showed them in a more ""look how cool this is"" type of way.

2018-02-03T03:10:50,"What I really hated about this movie was how they took the art from the first one, about Lorraine’s “vision” that terrified her and kept her in her bed for days. How Ed makes it out to be SO horrendous and evil that she will *never* discuss it. And then, in this one (part 2), they reveal that her “vision” was her husband Ed dying. Like, really?? What the fuck? I was SO pissed when I saw that. That part of the first one was probably the most disturbing part of the entire movie. But it ends up being something totally boring and stupid. Figures they would make it something that 1) doesn’t affect the audience in any way whatsoever, and 2) doesn’t really affect the movie at all.  I just totally feel like they ruined the entire franchise with that bullshit. I actually thought that that part affected the audience so much in the first one, that they could have easily made an entire part 3 based on that alone, Lorraine’s “vision”. At least, they could’ve if they made it about something scary.  Oh, and before some moronic American teenager tries saying “it’s a true story” well first of all, the Enfield Poltergeist was completely made up by that girl. None of it was real. Second, I don’t believe anything Ed and Lorraine did in real life. As they have been caught in a hoax several times over the course of their “careers”.  I think they have always been 100% full of shit. Even the Amityville Horror house was all a big giant hoax by the family that lived there. They admitted in later years, as did an author of a book based on the haunting. He said that the family who lived there had helped him make up various things that he could claim happened there.

2019-12-06T14:56:05,"HIGHLIGHT THIS  a movie possibly written by pedophile or instructed by rich organization with same beliefs. if you watch close youll notice between the main girl and the priest protagonist in the scene where he gives her advices about life and then the short dialog with the mother for consent and then him searching in the next scene in the filled with water basement making voices  with a symbolism and rediraction of your mind to some other things. There is a danger of people loosing touch and rich evil people who are easily bored with what life has to offer would go and proceed with such fantasies with little kids who are fresh and learning about life first then sexual life. Its sad and scary for some enraging. But its a lesson we must learn a ugly one for some. Short story this movie was funded with millions by different area of proffessions people who own these million in different ways, Maybe millions payed to watch the movie and got the mind intrigued behind the scenes to excuse or act on such fantasies of their own and kind. And many million where the earnings of this famous american movie. We have to understand world if in danger of loosing children our principles even love or respect of anything living. And if not pedophihlia then u should know that within that room of such desires exist others or death rapes manipulation in few words personal dark desires that will leave humanity out of the game for good.Subliminal messages in such a famous movie of millions in numbers make one think that this world live in is either fucked up or its walking near by that road. Of course i believe its not the first by what the hell....millionare funders of that movie millioners producers and actors who says they didnt act or not acting right in this moment on such fantasies. Im cold blooded too but child is a fresh soul i believe purged by anything related to sex and ready to be teached something higher. Its that phase not the phase of sexual education. Better say manipulation and misuse of a human personality for sexual self pleasure. Its sad scary enraging if its true but the messages are there for those who can read them,and as much as indifferent some of us are about anything in the world the kids are the future and in not any way able to consent with an adults sexual fantasies since there is no brain communication eithere that or physical appliance for this to happen. And they usually want your kids too you like it or not they dont get satisfied by acting upon their own only kids. Easily bored and insensitive people want variety to keep on living in that order. Your mother sister brother anything you call family. For me its scary and dissapointing to find out that there is a danger of people getting to just thrown in this world with a perspective of growing with love and friends to get abused from top to bottom of their rights by being condemned to live in a pansexual society.Unfortunately these directors funders etc hold the money of the world and whoever holds the money is both capable of building a system to teach their ideals or build tanks to defend those wrong ideals. Both media and army.In few words the politics they address we like it or not, are dangerous and not beautiful  in any way. By raising a kid with sexual education you loose a human being you cut his hope of ever understanding what is compassion and love.And if it happened the other way around a kid abuses and forces an adult to have sexual relations it would be excused or prevented. A millioner or an organization of adult manipulators with their feet inside every institution that holds the principles of right and freedom or love is a dangerous act. So dangerous that even me spreading this kind of information could get me tortured and killed if we where to live only in such era. But its there its going on its not global but money keeps the world spinning and whatever you believe or get comfortable or apathetic too you are condemned to live. If not you why your kids. I dont like to be called a roumor spreading machine for purpose of mine and propaganda but this is one reality. Keep the information and look yourself at the movie closely. Not only it promotes pedophilia it also defends other principals such as ""open mindness"" ""there is no God"" by saying god i mean no honestly good moral person out there who has not been overtaken by desire for power and control. Just skip and go at the movie where the protagonist priest is working with a sink while giving some information and advices of life to the little girl slowly trying to get out from here mouth the words of consent if she sexually prefers him whatsoever the age difference. There is a manipulation there shortly of an elder man bringing to the surface past life desires of that little girl when herself she was an adult who had a sexual partner. Then comes the mother and he askes her too something , implying i took the consent of the parent as well. As if that matters in such a dark time if such goverment was to be funded and operated regularly. Then comes at once the scene of an old man talking about his death of his daughter implying the spiritual death that this girl might had before she was born so she choose sex over love and that was her road/destiny already i never did something unatural with her. Ill remind you here the child in a great deal is born without sexual fantasies and if she is in a bad road she is in this world to learn love over the other first then proceed unwillingfuly and without pleasure in such acts. And in a very sneaky way the exact next scene was of the same priest protagonist walking with a electric toarch inside a basement filled with water groaning and making voices that imply sexual images in ones mind ,specifically in a adults mind. So it was consent from the little girl , hiprocritical questioning of the parent ( mother) about the right to proceed ,then the supposed background of what the childs soul is made of from past traumas , saying that she was already dead by love she is from another agenda so excusing her age , saying age its nothing her soul had many lifetimes and ""i can tell"" she would never develop to be an elder mature woman with morals later on , and  to finish with it and make us more interested in it , the symbolical walking in a water filled basement making sex times voices and moaning trying to ""find the ghost"" inside that little basement. Its very sad for some enraging for some scary. But its there in a old language of symbolism and hidden communication that works in our mind usually when we focus on poetic language. And its there if you once assume its there but then again i told you the whole sequence of those series of scenes. Go look by yourself. Until then try to not buy anything and make some people rich and then they are able to act upon poor countries and buy kids adopt or whatever for bed times fantasies with them. Its our future destroyed its THEIR future destroyed and pedophilia its just a part of a very very very dark rainbow of many other criminal actiities. Not to get furious understand also the mind of a pedophile and be humane and try to stop this massacre not by burning in the stake weak human beings even if they are millionaires they are living in vanity and in image not in truth and a compact way. They have no friends no family no true partner in life. They have their image and their egoism . Money helps in that problem. There is something going on its not global yet and i dont believe it will ever be if we dont close our eyes at everything we see and hear or feel. Act upon it in smart and sensible ways but radical aswell. Not 100 years ago was the second WW where hitler was to establish a global system of rape and murder inside there pedophilia.",0,0,frantzesko bouna,VFsmuRPClr4,0.044348875976094895,2019-12-06 14:56:05,False,False

In mit Kriminellen gefüllten Gefängnissen kann es vorkommen. Wie in dem Film The Platform, der im März letzten Jahres zu Netflix kam. Der spanische Film von Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia zeigt ein brutales Experiment in einem sozialen Zustand in einem vertikalen Gefängnis. Der Thriller-Genre-Film erzählt vom System des Essens in einem vertikalen Gefängnis. Es wird vertikal gesagt, weil es viele Stockwerke gibt, indem 2 Gefangene pro Stockwerk gefüllt werden. Das Lebensmittelverteilungssystem verwandelt Gefangene in hungernde Tiere. Eine Kanzel voller Lebensmittel kommt aus der obersten oder der obersten Etage und hält in jeder Etage an.
