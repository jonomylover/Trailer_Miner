Second, where is the fantastical element? You definitely don't know this is a work of fantasy judging by this trailer. It makes it look more like a gangster flick.

2017-05-03T14:30:41,"I always thought one of the coolest scenes in the book was when Eddie had to shoot his way out of a drug house butt-naked. That's courageous. But the entire Gunslinger mythos has always inspired me for some odd reason. To have guns that are forged from the swords of Arthur Eld, to wield them as the Gunslinger did, to have been raised in a culture where the Gun is the way of life...all of these things create an almost mystical world full of technology, dereliction and decadence from a time not entirely separate from our own. It's almost as though the things we've discarded have fallen through to Roland's world. It's where the pillars of our own universe--and many others--are firmly rooted. I don't know...I just feel like we're all looking for our own Dark Tower and some are more driven than others. And there are those of us who are driven to extremes that some would say border on lunacy. Whatever our Dark Tower might be--whatever it is we're looking for--sometimes we have to discard the things most precious to us to find it, to scale the stairs and to reach the top. I know Roland the Gunslinger lost a lot in the books. Love and sense of self being but two things out of many. He's seen a lot and he has a kind of 'frontier wisdom' that I hope comes through in this cinematic adaptation. I'm holding out for ""Cool Blue Shooter's Eyes"" such as Roland had in the book. Roland, for me, has become an archetype for one who has lost it all just trying to find his way in the world, utilizing skill sets that some of us may view as archaic but that in his world are indicative of an old and ancient nobility. The books got a little slow, at times, and were somewhat difficult to finish. But I did finish them. All the way. To the very End.

From EW: ‚ÄúThe hardcore fans of The Dark Tower series will know that this is actually a sequel  to the books in a way,‚Äù director and co-writer Nikolaj Arcel says. ‚ÄúIt has a lot of the same elements,  a lot of the same characters, but it is a different journey.‚Äù  Without doubt, the most significant story change is the absence of two major characters who, in the books, were pulled from our world to join Roland‚Äôs quest: the reformed heroin junkie Eddie, and the amputee with multiple personalities, Susannah. Constant Readers who‚Äôve been following the production have probably noticed that no one has been cast in those roles yet. The bad news: they won‚Äôt be. Although‚Ä¶ an allusion to them may be in the cards. The good news: if there‚Äôs a sequel, they are guaranteed.  From Collider: For those of you still concerned that this adaptation won‚Äôt be in line with King‚Äôs vision, the acclaimed author had this very frank statement to share:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 100 percent behind it ‚Äî which doesn‚Äôt mean it necessarily will work, just that it‚Äôs a good way to try and to get into these stories.‚Äù http://ew.com/article/2016/07/14/dark-tower-movie-wont-feature-eddie-susannah/http://collider.com/the-dark-tower-sequel/",0,1,Russell Gillett,GjwfqXTebIY,0.09345238095238095,2017-05-03 18:47:24,True,True

The first book in the series, though it has been awhile sense I read it, only had like one big action scene in it, the one right at the start.   This trailer seems to show off what looks to be a fairly generic action movie, and is way off from any of the books. Hell, *Spoilers* don't read if haven't read the books yet, In the book Roland doesn't even go to our more modern world until the second book, and he didn't go there with the kid, and it was after he got his fingers on his right hand tore off, which then got infected, and he nearly died because of it.

I hope the  director gets that... I'll also add, Stephen King's a great writer but a total crap director, and the more control he gets over his films, the worse they are. Hearts in Atlantis, the Windcatcher - both excellent novels. Both horrendous films... And it kinda looks like that kid can't act? No offense... It's a really hard part for a kid to play. Here's an excerpt from the original story:  ""Jake opened his folder to take a final look at what he had written on the topic My Understanding of Truth.  He was genuinely interested in this, because he could no more remember writing his Final Essay, than he could remember studying for his French final.    He looked at the title page with puzzlement and growing unease.  MY UNDERSTANDING OF TRUTH, By Jake Chambers, was neatly typed and centered on the sheet, and that was all right, but he had for some reason pasted two photographs below it.  One was of a door - he thought it might be the one at Number 10, Downing Street, in London - and the other was of an Amtrak train.  They were color shots, undoubtedly culled from some magazine.  Why did I do that?  And when did I do that?  He turned the page and stared down at the first page of his Final Essay, unable to believe or understand what he was seeing.  Then, as understanding began to trickle through his shock, he felt an escalating sense of horror.  It had finally happened; he had finally lost enough of his mind so that other people would be able to tell.""",0,0,Thomas Smith,GjwfqXTebIY,0.026327312534209085,2017-05-03 19:22:59,True,True

But these don't really interest me as explanations, nor does this film being some amalgamation of Books 1, 5, and some new re-imagining that some Hollywood scriptwriters put together.  Seeing this just confirms my fears that I won't want to see something I've looked forward to, and that's not saying it will be a bad film, it's just not the film I want to see.    This reminds me a lot of I Am Legend, since Hollywood has made that incredible story into a film three times, and all three were ok films, just ok at best; but they never seem interested in capturing the grit and horror of the book.  That's what this looks like, it looks like a good film for most people unfamiliar with the source material, but from what I as an insanely committed fan of the book series hoped for, I'm just not seeing it in this trailer, nor have I felt it when reading about the making of this film.  To everyone who see's it, I hope it's good and you enjoy it, but I just know I won't, so I just won't ever watch this.

Not because I'm a racist! Rather, Apollo was originally a black character - and I liked it that way.  I be pissed not because they chose a white guy.  More so that they changed the context of the story that I enjoyed.   What really needs to happen is black writers need to come up with better story lines that will appeal to broader audiences.  This years ""Get Out"" is a prime example.  We have to figure out a way to get stories other than gangs, drugs and violence on the big screen.   Then black actors would have more prospects and opportunities to play interesting characters that are written for them.  I know Hollywood is f***'d up but it can be done!

2017-05-03T21:37:30,"As far as character selection goes, while Idris Elba is a good actor, it is known to those who read the books that Roland Deschain was based on Clint Eastwood.   Clint Eastwood is old, he's 86 now.  A suitable replacement would be Viggo Mortensen.  He has the look, and he's a good actor.  Plus, he's 58 now, and the only time Roland was ever truly portrayed as young, was in memory flashbacks and in Wizard and Glass and in The Wind Through the Keyhole.    And for everyone saying Roland was never truly portrayed as white, yes he was in Drawing of the Three when Detta referred to him as a Honk Mofa and also sensed his complete whiteness, and in The Dark Tower it was while he was with Irene Tassenbaum that it was further revealed that not only was he white, he may have had Native American blood as well.

I hope the movie is still good  but judging from this trailer it will probably be as true to the books as World War Z was.,1,0,Brian Cathey,GjwfqXTebIY,0.2371428571428571,2017-05-03 23:54:36,True,True

In this latest version of the quest, he kept it with him, which changes things for the next cycle of the story.

2017-05-04T00:11:10,"Ok, so it seems that this entire movie will have nothing to do with the original story from the books. That is very disheartening, as I wanted to see that story be brought to life at some point.  But it would at least partially explain why Roland is suddenly black, because the Dark Tower is basically holding the multiverse together and in one of those worlds, Roland could defintely be black. I'm ok with that now.  But there's still a lot about this trailer that makes me fear that this will just be a run-of-the-mill overly stylised action movie which compresses too much of the mythology of TDT into an incoherent mess and is more concerned with over the top action-scenes. Gunslinger shooting without looking? One of the essential parts of the mantra Elba is reciting in this trailer is ""I do not aim with my hand, [...] I aim with my eye"". Gunslingers are great shots, but they aren't Jedi. Same goes for the silly mid-air reload. I'm now willing to give this movie a chance, but my expectations after this trailer are VERY low. I do however like the eastereggs about other King works in the movie, and I think McConaughey as Walter/MIB and the actor they have for Jake are fitting for their roles. I'm just still sad that they didn't try to adapt the original source material. I would've loved to see the original Ka-tet in action.

2017-05-04T00:26:14,Idris Elba's casting as Roland is an obvious red herring to stir up Internet controversy so that people will go out to see the movie to prove that they aren't racist. The producers obviously took way too many creative liberties with the source material and the end result is inevitably going to be mediocre. I have a sneaking suspicion that this movie was made by jamming a bunch of half-assed dark tower references into some rejected fantasy-action movie script that a studio exec found at the bottom of his file cabinet next to the baggies of cocaine and used condoms. the only purpose this movie serves is to prevent the studio from losing the movie rights to the dark tower. Remember that shitty Fantastic 4 movie that caused the exact same controversy by casting a black guy as the human torch? That movie was made at the same time that Fox was about to lose the rights to Fantastic 4. It's a shame that Idris Elba got conned into starring in this abomination.

2017-05-04T00:27:10,"There's definitely a few problems here in my opinion. My issue specifically is with the nature of the dark tower that is depicted in this. I feel like in the books it was something beyond comprehension, a constant thing in the background which drives everyone in the books almost to the point of obsession, the centre of everything that is. It just seems almost a little clich√© the way they depict it here, although It's just a trailer so that might be an early judgment. I also feel the series wasn't as focused on fight scenes as much as this, it was always sudden bursts of violence which almost shocked the reader. Obviously they have also smashed many parts of the book into one story which is a little disappointing but understandable because of the length the movie can't really do an epic like the Dark Tower series justice.   I don't know what all the complaining about Roland is about though, Idris definitely got the feeling of the character, I don't think his race is really an issue. It's pretty refreshing actually, and if the movie is trying to keep a distance from the exact story of the books then it does make sense to change it up a little. To be honest I'm just happy that this will more than likely encourage a wider audience to get into the books. I feel they never really got the praise they deserved.

Doesn't really matter now because Eastwood is a beast of a director.   ""For me the character is still the character. It's almost a Sergio Leone character, like the Man with No Name,"" while remarking, ""He can be white or black, it makes no difference to me. I think it opens all kind of exciting possibilities for the backstory.""  http://ew.com/article/2016/02/29/dark-tower-rises-stephen-king-idris-elba-and-matthew-mcconaughey/",6,3,The last,GjwfqXTebIY,0.10277777777777776,2017-05-04 01:18:17,True,True

2017-05-04T01:42:13,"Ok so as a fan of the original book series, (as well as the ones that are tie ins, like insomnia, everything's eventual, hearts in Atlantis, etc), I can understand the frustration of some of the commentors. But there are a few things to keep in mind here. As for Roland being black in this movie, I too did have concerns because what ramifications would that have on Susannah's character since much of what made her who she was was an undertone of isolation being the not only the only female but also the only black member of their ka-tet. In this movie that's going to be a non issue since her character is not in it. Now whether this becomes a franchise & they eventually do more movies or not may change that. That being said, Roland is a rather difficult character to cast for & Idris is one of the few people whom can pull it off. So I think it's only fair to give him a chance. Additionally, you also have to remember, for those that really DID read the books, Roland has the horn of Eld in this movie. that is very important because the only point in which he has it in the books is when he is standing in the Mohine desert AFTER reaching the tower at the end of the 7th book. in the story arc of the books, the horn of eld was lost on Jericho hill & only returned to him at the end as he began a new cycle, immediately forgetting the last. this movie IS that new cycle. sure I wanted to see Eddie, Susannah, the people of Calla Byrn Sturgis, Callahan, Patrick Danville, even John Farson, all those people too. The raid on Algul Siento, Jake & Callahan storming the Dixie Pig, ol double ugly getting eaten alive by monstrosities, & maybe that is all still to come in future movies. or maybe that will be in a tv show format where honestly books tend to better translate to film anyway. however it's clear that this movie is not an adaption of the 7 cannon novels, but a continuation from where they ended. this movie is starting not at the the beginning of the gunslinger, (book 1) but at the end of the dark tower, (book 7). in short, new territory. So go into it with an open mind.",28,6,xSlappykinkaidx,GjwfqXTebIY,0.08916450216450217,2017-05-04 01:42:13,True,True

I also really love the idea of this being a sequel of sorts to the final book (readers know what this means).    However...the tone of this doesn't really match up with the incredibly grim, dark tone of the books.  This seems a bit too glitzy and show-offy.  I'm also not getting the impression that this is a hard R movie, which it absolutely needs to be, perhaps more than the vast majority of R-rated films to come out in recent memory.  The Dark Tower deals with absolutely grotesque themes, extreme violence, insanely vulgar dialogue and more than a healthy serving of sex and nudity.

The medium for that story fits in a book. This movie being a sequel to the whole book series is starting out more action packed and the effects of all worlds coming down is emphasized clearly. Also, hopefully the Crimson King get portrayed as the big baddie that he's supposed to be (or at least referenced more, he only was talked about very minimally in throughout the series and only showed up at the end). With Jake drawing pics of the Gunslinger and all, I think it's portraying that he somewhat remembers the Gunslinger from previous cycles(called Shine or something in the movie) Hopefully Roland remembers also cause the whole reason he has to go through this journey again and again is because of his character and how he would be willing to let others die so he could reach his goal.

Roland best resembled Clint Eastwood - which after all is who he was written after.  But Roland also resembles Denzel Washington's character from The Magnificent 7.

2017-05-04T06:20:21,"*SPOILERS AHEAD*  I'll hold my full judgments for the actual movie, but a huge part of TDT story arc is Roland turning from this ruthless person who seeks the tower for unknown reasons (?), into someone who comes to find kinship and loyalty in the Ka Tet he ""draws"" along the way.   In fact, Roland's ruthless behavior in the first book is only overshadowed by The Man in Black. If you didn't understand his true motives, when you read the first chapter of the first book it feels like he brutally murders an unarmed farmer for nothing, and is forced to murder a woman who was cursed by the knowledge of the secret of death. Roland is partially insane because he gazed into Maerlyn's grapefruit for far too long. His sense of justice was distorted by it.      Idris Elba, on the other hand, seems like he's a hero fighting for ""justice"". I like his chiseled looks as much as the next person, but I agree that they should have made him look more haggard for this particular film. He feels like he exists outside of his decaying world, and is not a part of it.      Also, the interdimensionality gaps for characters like Jake have more horror and subtlety aspect in the books. I wish that they played Jake so that his visions were more disjointed and his behavior was more erratic before he resolved the break between worlds. I mean, the kid threw himself in front of a car and saw himself falling through a chasm of eternity. I don't just want other characters to feel like he was insane, I wish that the audience also felt  like HE could actually be totally insane. The confirmation of his ""rantings"" through an earthquake was a bit eyeroll for me.    Roland is awful chatty in this film and provides a lot of exposition, and I understand why people like that in movies but...    Thus far, it feels more like a straightforward action film with some jump scares interspersed and a DT flavor  Also, the tone seems kinda off... The books are horror/fantasy with a splash of sci fi. Marketing the movie as an action film just adds to the confusion. I wish this trailer were created more like a horror film and less like an action film.   In fact, to me, right now, Westworld feels more like TDT than TDT feels like TDT   I know trying to condense these books into something watchable has been a chore. I understand why they made certain choices and concede to big Hollywood on (probably a lot of) decisions.   I just hope they did not forget the face of their fathers.",4,0,my_throw_away_channel,GjwfqXTebIY,-0.034753787878787884,2017-05-04 06:20:21,True,True

2017-05-04T06:45:24,"(HERE BE BOOK SPOILERS)  To people who accuse book fans of 'whining' about casting of Idris Elba as Roland: you obviously don't understand what it means for the plot of the adaptation. It means that even if Eddie Dean and Detta/Odetta/Susannah Walker appear in the sequel (and I think it's a safe bet they won't appear in this one), the relationship between members of the ka-tet will likely lose in complexity in nuance. It won't be fraught with racism, bigotry and mutual distrust (unless Susannah is cast as a white supremacist or something?).  Similarly, it does not bode well for the portrayal of Gunslinger himself. Let me remind you that the book Roland is as anti-heroic as they come: he is obsessed with reaching the Tower and does pretty horrific things in order to achieve his goal. I guess the jury's out on this, but I just can't see the black lead character murdering an entire village or betraying Jake and letting him fall to his death. It would be ironic if casting a black actor as Roland would lead to the whitewashing of his character.  I'm well aware that this movie isn't intended as a faithful adaptation but rather a sequel to the book series. But turning Dark Tower into a straightforward, good vs. evil, black vs. white (har har) fantasy romp still does not feel right to me.  Still, when viewed on its own, this does look great. Elba's acting and choreography are amazing, the role of RÃ∂aÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂aÃ∂lÃ∂lÃ∂ Ã∂FÃ∂lÃ∂aÃ∂gÃ∂gÃ∂  Walter Padick fits McConaughey like a glove.

Since none of the movie studios had the balls to bring the actual story to film, King now tells us that Deschain is no longer stuck in a loop, but that things change with each run through. Leaving us with a hope that the series did not originally embody, and what is sure to be the bitter taste of sell out in our mouths. It is not a reboot like Star Trek, as King would have us believe. But a departure from his original storyline, which robs us of what made this story what it was in the first place. Replacing despair with a sense of hope that things can change for the better. That Roland mayhap find peace. And escape his fate. Leaving our hero to abandon his post, fading from memory. All the while, trying to dupe the reader into believing that everything works out for the best in the great finality of it all.

2017-05-04T11:57:09,For those that are not readers of King's works.  Walter. The man in black played by Matthew Mcconaughey is the same person as Flagg in The Stand.  Walter or Flagg is at fault for the majority of horrible events happen in King's works. He moves through time and planes of existence either destroying out of enjoyment or for moving the pieces in place to obtain power or change events.  98% of King's works have to do with The Dark Tower. The readers of the novels would tell you that it's just as if not more epic than the Game of Thrones novels.   Many characters from King's works pop up in reference or as characters themselves.  Dark Tower has always been the focus. There are very few works that are not attached to The Dark Tower.   IT is a demon from the same world as Roland. I would be shocked if there were no exchange of references in both movies.  The Mist is attached to The Dark Tower.

A myriad of tiny changes that will eventually lead to Roland's salvation. But that's always been my own assumption. What if things actually change A LOT each time? What if every time Roland goes after the tower it's almost a completely different story? Maybe Eddie and Susannah never even show up this time around, and are left to enjoy their reward for their actions in the last loop. This is a continuation after all, not an adaptation.  I'm just as interested to see how the Roland/Detta dynamic will now work as anyone else (if she shows up), but it's also true that not many actors are of a caliber to play Roland.

If you remember at the end of book 7, Roland starts back at the beginning, this time carrying the horn of Eld, which he didn't have at the beginning of the first book.  Each time Roland starts over something else has changed.  This is one of those restarts; most likely the final one.

I believe Roland (in the books), and by extension the entire series, to be an allegory to 'Do not go gentle into that good night'.   This trailer feels like a teenage movie something akin to the Maze Runner etc. and that depresses me. Even if it is meant to be Roland on the next time around (an idea that would give loads of creative licence), it should still have the same atmospheric feel to it.

2017-05-06T00:49:50,"If you read a lot of Stephen King's commentaries about the early days of him writing the series, it's fairly... bland. The first book (The Gunslinger) is also fairly bland compared to the others. I remember him reminiscing in one of his novels about various trips to a cabin in the summer during stormy weather, coming back to the original manuscript and touching it up to the final version of The Gunslinger that's available today. To those just watching this this trailer for the first time thinking for a great action movie, there's a TON of backstory and exposition that makes this universe come to life. This first movie is more of a re-imagining of the series than it is a faithful adaptation. This is coming from someone who has read the Dark Tower series once per year for the past 15 years.  That being said, this trailer has me fairly excited to see how this iconic series is re-imagined in our modern age. For reference, King started writing this series in the '70s and finally finished it in the early 2000's. I won't spoil things for anyone who hasn't read the series, but it goes on some fairly strange tangents (that sandwich sauce [book 6]). Thumbs up if you get that reference.  I feel like this movie is going to pay homage to the original novel (The Gunslinger), but take obvious liberties as it's ""supposed"" to take place after the novels (ie, Roland in NY before ever meeting Eddie). The whole novel series is fairly complex in its timelines. Feel free to debunk me on this.",3,1,Jeff Linton,GjwfqXTebIY,0.18247126436781613,2017-05-06 00:49:50,True,True

If you finished the series, you should understand that and what the Horn of Eld means, and the last thing Gan says to Roland. This film is a continuation of the story, as Roland has been through the same cycle many, many times and always makes the wrong choices.   This time around, he has the Horn of Eld, which is the last remaining artifact of All World That Was, aside from Roland's guns. It has the potential to change his path, as having the Horn means almost the entire timeline of the DT could have massive changes. This is why things are happening differently this time, and why this should almost certainly be Roland's last journey to the Tower before he is granted peace.

Originally, I was a little curious about the casting choice for Roland. This was only because it would change the dynamic between he and a certain ""drawn"" individual.   After some reflection, in the end, I don't think that it's really that detrimental to the story.  I hope the film does amazing. I want them to see it through to the end.

Notice the lip sync is off in places. Makes me think different dialogue was recorded for the trailer. There's no way Jake has to explain the importance of the Tower to Roland. That's the only thing I find off-putting. The whole, ""Jake not dying and instead finding a NCP doorway to Mid-World"" thing is plausible in the existing lore, so I don't have a problem with it. Ka, like the wheel.  The trailer generally looks great. I'm looking forward to see where they go with the story, because the trailer indicates massive changes.

2017-05-07T02:50:34,"For anyone unfamiliar with the original story this looks fantastic. For those who have read the books, yes, Roland should be white and yes, changing his race does have a significant impact on the story because of racial elements within it that will have to be changed. With that said, Idris is an amazing actor, and from the trailer, it looks like he has absolutely nailed the part, as well as anyone possibly could with physical traits that disagree with the author's description (and die-hards' preconceived notions) of the character. Every movie adaptation changes parts of the story, and as long as they are able to do this while keeping the feel and the overall plot somewhat true to the original (which remains to be seen) I don't think this is a problem. The only issue I have with it is possibly the motivation of the studio to cast Idris. If they cast him because they felt he was the best person for the job, and that casting him was worth the blowback from the picky fans and the changes that needed to be made to the story because of the expectation of a great performance from him, then I applaud them for taking a risk and not excluding him on the basis of race. If, on the other hand, they chose him _because_ he is black, to make a statement to those who try to make everything about race and to gain popularity from those who complain about racism where it doesn't exist, then I think it was a poor choice. Unfortunately, we may never know why they did it, and we will just have to wait and see how true to the source the movie ends up being, and whether it's still a solid movie despite its departure from its roots.",14,10,r3tr064m3r,GjwfqXTebIY,0.18263888888888882,2017-05-07 02:50:34,True,True

2017-05-09T16:13:54,"It‚Äôs important to distinguish the movie franchise from the books. The movies are not a straight up adaption of the books, they are a sequel of sorts.   SPOILER WARNING SPOILER WARNING  At the end of DT7, Roland reaches the top of the Tower and is horrified to learn that he‚Äôs completed his journey many, many times before. The voice from the tower, which I presume to be Gan, says ‚ÄúThis is your promise that things may be different, Roland ‚Äì that there may yet be rest.‚Äù He is pushed through the doorway back to the beginning of his trek across the Mohaine Desert, but this time he has the Horn of Eld. This is significant, as the Horn of Eld is a symbol of Roland‚Äôs lineage, his purpose and his companions. He was destined to wind the horn as he made his way through Can-Ka-No-Rey (the field of roses at the base of the tower), but in the books, he loses it when his friend, Cuthbert, gets killed at the Battle of Jericho Hill.  Now Roland has the Horn of Eld, it means that everything can change. With the Horn of Eld, he may be less inclined to watch his ka-tet sacrifice themselves for his quest. This is why the trailer shows things that do not happen in the books. Jake doesn‚Äôt die to get to Mid-World, he finds a doorway, like he does in The Sailor arc of The Drawing of the Three, and I‚Äôm willing to bet that Roland doesn‚Äôt make the same choice as before when it comes down to saving Jake or finding the Tower.  I liked quite a lot about the trailer. I enjoyed seeing parts of Mid-World, the Mohaine Desert, Gilead and the portal. I liked the glow in Roland‚Äôs eyes and his guns when he fires. It‚Äôs a good compromise between the bombardier-blue eyes he has in the books, and it also highlights that Roland‚Äôs abilities aren‚Äôt entirely natural to new audiences. Roland looks badass in his outfit, but it does seem a little too pristine for someone who has spent a good chunk of time wandering across an inhospitable desert.  There were a few things I didn‚Äôt like. Jake shouldn‚Äôt have to explain the importance of the Tower to Roland, and Roland should need no encouragement to reach it. However, judging by the obvious ADR done on the dialogue, I do wonder whether that was added to the trailer to explain the basic story. Explaining the Dark Tower to someone can be exhausting, as many fans will attest.   Also, what were the orc looking things fighting for Walter? They clearly aren‚Äôt Taheen. They don‚Äôt look much like slow mutants to me either. These might be a new addition to the series as cannon fodder for Roland and Jake. That might be a bad call, as the DT books had action in them, but was generally a much slower-paced affair. I‚Äôm hoping they don‚Äôt turn it into an action film with less character development.  That town they were in at the end, that's either Tull or Pricetown, right? Am I forgetting any other settlements?",11,2,Adam D.,GjwfqXTebIY,0.08370860169640656,2017-05-09 16:13:54,True,True

Idris looks nothing like SK, Roland, nor Eastwood.  Roland is based on a real French paladin, does that imply that the original Roland, Charlemagne, and possibly Arthur Eld are also darker skinned? Its very likely this will never be addressed, as a fan of the books this is unacceptable, you cannot change the story and characters without it reflecting on the background canon and mythology.  \\   Back to the original Roland, his king was the aforementioned Charlemagne. In the year 1,000 A.D. the locals dug up Charlemagne's dead body, they feared that the Devil would rise up to Earth and it would be the battle of Armageddon, so they needed the dead king to fight and save the world. This is real history.  Rolands weapons and horn are based on the real Roland's; Durendal and Olifant. These were real, these are real, so to say that its a new universe and those things never happened or they happened in a different way is a cop out, it doesn't address the how or the why, just what happened much later.  \\  Odetta Holmes is also based a real person, if they change Roland then there is a good chance they will change, remove, or otherwise alter her character.

Which is actually pretty exciting if you've read all the books. :3 Also, yes Roland was white and that did play heavily into him earning Detta's trust later but if they cut anything from the film adaptation, it will be some of Detta's ...rougher edges and that was the only real important aspect of whatever Roland's skin color may be. Not that I think they should cut anything, but you know they will and if it IS truly meant as a sequel, that opens the doors for any number of things to be different this time around. Anyway, Idris Elba is an EXCELLENT choice for Roland! You don't need blue eyes for a piercing gaze, people.

This has never been more true than now reading all the hate from (fans?) of King's work.  King himself warned us of this before the Coda at the end of the final Dark Tower book. He warns us not to continue reading. He warns us that nothing he writes within the Tower could possibly fulfill what great expectations we, (the constant reader) have for Roland at the Tower. But we insist. We are Tower junkies like Roland himself. So, King writes it because we MUST see what is at the Tower. And that is the point of the ending. WE are the reason Roland is thrust back to the beginning. In essence, WE the constant reader, we FORCE Roland into that Tower when King warned us to let it go. We did it anyway.   Now...this time Roland has the horn. I believe that the horn represents hope. I believe that this being the final time around, Roland carries the horn as a symbol of hope. He will right the wrongs from the times before, hence NOT allow Jake to die in pursuit of the Tower. The horn will balance out Roland's obsession for the Tower, and he will make the right choices. In fact, an alternate ending may come of this, where Roland reaches the Dark Tower, is granted entry, but simply walks away.

The dark tower is just to cool not to tell it exactly the way stephen king told it. the lord of the rings movies followed tolkiens plot almost exactly to the letter, and they are good movies. to mangle or simplify the lord of the rings would have been seen as blasphemous, but people dont have the same respect for stephen king as they do for tolkien, but they should, the dark tower is one of the very best fantasy epics of all time, up there with lord of the rings.  They should have made the movie about the first book in the series. if the audience liked it they can keep making sequels, the way harry potter movies are handled  they should NOT have tried to condense its plot and themes into a single movie, the result is clearly a neutered, simplified and quite frankly crummy facsimile.

Whereas that series got like eight movies, and it had less overall pages than dark tower, and they didn't feel the need to change large aspects of their story. this just screams PG-13, like a lot of the decisions on the changes weren't ""artistic"" as much as profitable, I get it, it's a ""sequel"".... I probably don't just speak for myself when I say, I don't really want a sequel... after reading a story of over four thousand pages multiple times, I liked the story the way it was, ya know, good...I guess my point is, if you used some of your precious time to read this, is that the twilight people get their series, the Hunger games, the divergent or whatever, get theirs, and this is what we get?

I'm shocked to see the parts were casted the other way around. It has nothing to do with race.. certain actors just fit certain roles better. Idris imo has a very limited repertoire as an actor, but he plays one-dilemsional characters extremely well, especially bad guys. Roland is a outstandingly completed figure, Mcconaughey would really have to bring his ""A"" game, but he would fit the part well. This is kind of like casting a movie about Martin L. King with the Doctor himself being a white guy. Or a Ghandi movie with Ghandi as a mexican. Now obviously Roland not being white doesn't approach that same level, but it's still the same brand of silliness. It's a shame Clint Eastwood is far to old to play Roland, it would of been one of the all time greatest fits of actor to character.

It's like James Bond - they're all James Bond, the same and yet different.   I also like how they've handled the plot - instead of this being based on the books that we've read, this is (SPOILER ALERT!!)

As for the plot and world changes, I don't know man.  What they did to the story looks like it could be interesting, but it seems such an overhaul and simplification...I don't see how it could possibly do the original story justice.  Plus, I don't think the filmmakers understand it's a dying, worn-out _universe_, not just world, that Roland comes from.  I guess I'll just try to forget the books while watching this.

If you feel like this movie betrays so much the original book, then just think about it as a story set in a universe parallel to the one of the dark tower books, and stop thinking that this movie should be the exact same dark tower you read.

Where indeed to go for inspiration? Films are just way too rushed and artists and actors are way too traumatized to slip into their roles.

Unfortunately it felt like it needed an extra 40 to 50 minutes to fully explain the mythology and provide more satisfying experience of the big screen adaption. It is a rainy night type of movie and you are not missing out if you don't ever see it so make your own judgement .2.5/5",7,1,M Family,GjwfqXTebIY,-0.026018518518518545,2017-11-30 12:59:54,False,False

2020-05-03T17:06:51,"So, i'm seeing in the comments,"" its not as good as the books"" ,etc.  Keep in mind that Sony picked this up and made it into a movie, so at the least, people that have no knowledge of the books that originated this movie will have at least had some contact  with the original content, despite lacking the robustness of the books. Here's another point: some people will go back for the books after seeing the movie. I, for one, have done such. I've also done it in the past to two other movies that Stephen King released.  Also, some people just have unrealistic expectations when it comes to entertainment. If Netflix, or Hulu picked this up, then, yeah - I could see the books being reproduced in seasons that would cover everything,  but Sony got it.  So the movie was done as it was.  Me? I enjoyed both.  I feel some just need to relax. You didnt like the movie?  That's your opinion. Others have. Besides, the movie put away over 100 million dollars in sales off a 60 million dollar budget. How bad was the movie if it made that much money ? And before you say anything, yes , Roland being black probably upset the die hard readers, but this doesn't surprise me at all.  Keep in mind the time line of these books, then divide that by Sony being involved.  In fact, i find it ironic for people to whine about something like this when I've seen this several times over in so many books and movies much older and better. The killing part is the end result was the same: a shit load of money being madeat the box office and a couple of butt hurt critics .
