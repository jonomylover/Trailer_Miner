The jokes about Jews are always funny and the performances of the actors normally exceed expectations. In the case of Caf√© Society something went wrong in this formula. The actors, with rare exceptions, did not convince me, the jokes lost their grace and that something different, the letter of Rudolph Valentino, tastes like d√©j√† vu, because we have seen similar scene with the mirror Shirley MacLaine in The Apartment. The disclosed blurb promises but does not fulfill the mission to please the spectators, nostalgic to review the old Hollywood, the 1930s Woody builds a warm story in which the protagonist would be an alter ego of the director / actor when young, but without the same grace to tell jokes. The truth is that nothing delighted me in this movie. I expected the ambition of the boy for a career in Hollywood, but his claims are very modest.
