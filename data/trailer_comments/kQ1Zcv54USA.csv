2018-01-08T22:21:56,"I dont have high hopes for this. I know it's paying homage to the blaxploitation genre, thats great and all, but thats not the point. The ONE trailer this movie has only shows mindless action, with no detail into what this movie is even about. Secondly that gun animation is terrible. It's 2018!!! That animation looks like it was ripped from 2004! That shows the makers of this didn't put enough effort to make it look good. Lastly, they're relying way too heavily on Taraji P. Henson's fame to carry this movie. Putting her name in bold along with the title, and on all the posters and whatever marketing this movie had. Plus, that's another thing. This movie had no marketing whatsoever. 1 trailer released 6 months ago garnered only 1 million views. How are you going to get people to see your movie if they don't even know it exists!!

I wrote the song about a mythical riverboat, cruising on a mythical river, in a mythical time. Perhaps, the setting was 'back in time' on the Mississippi River.

I liked the way it blended the principle of MOTHER with and against the background of  the activities of gangsters. There's a great LAST bit and LAST line in it , (made me laugh) but I won't give it away.   I remember that actress in Person of Interest (a great series) ; there's something about her (is it her face or her voice? not sure) that always for some reason makes me think of those old great female singers of the 70s, like Aretha Franklin and Gladys knight and so on.
