I have seen Breaking Bad 3 times, that is how much I enjoyed the story, the actors, and the scenery. Could not find anything of interest on Netflix till I came across one with the actor David Duchovny from X-files. The title is Aquarius and is based on Charles Manson and his family. I was 19 when I heard of the murders happening in California and the capturing of the killers of Sharon Tate, Abigail Folger and others.  This is a 13 part series with the story including politicians. I found it very well done and came close to Breaking Bad as far as captivating because I lived through those times of civil unrest and the Vietnam War. My husband was there and came back very messed up. I truly enjoyed it and think for those of you that are going through Breaking Bad withdrawals, you may appreciate this series. I am a 68 year old grandma so if some of you have someone my age tell them about the series. It is on Netflix. Many of my friends from the neighborhood in Chicago were also in Vietnam. The stories they tell about the war are unbelievable. Anyway there are many pieces to this series and I hope you take the time to watch it.
