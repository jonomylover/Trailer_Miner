This movie is based on the Japanese sci-fi novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" and the original character in it was a young Japanese soldier. Instead of giving the lead role to an Asian American actor Hollywood continues its racist practice of marginalizing nonwhite actors to just stereotypes and supporting actors in favor of white actors.  Warner Brothers previously did this with Argo where the real life person that Ben Affleck was playing was Latino, they want to do it with Akira by whitewashing the Japanese characters and now they have done it with this movie here.  The ironic thing is that in the original novel there was a female character who was a white American meaning you could've still have a white person in a lead role if you followed the characters' ethnicities as in the original novel but the fact that Warner Brothers and Doug Liman whitewashed the main character from a young Japanese character to Tom Cruise shows that Hollywood is a white supremacist institution.Ôªø",7,20,DaRunningMan,vw61gCe2oqI,0.08977272727272728,2013-12-12 18:55:18,True,True

As for what the trailer told us, it said plenty, here is what I got from it.  Tom Cruise is a prisoner or civilian being drafted into combat, and his first battle is the start of an invasion, likely onto either another planet, or an infested half of our own planet. The enemies are aliens or some such, if you could not grasp that much. He goes into battle, and the invasion fails, and everyone dies, including him. But then he groundhog days' and wakes up before the invasion happens, just as he is being readied for battle. This happens again and again, with Tom Cruise Trying different things each time.  Eventually he finds someone who this has happened to before, and she understands and believes his story. She is an uber badass, and offers to train him each time after he dies until he is so bad ass that he will find a way to win the way...or something like that.  That is what I got from looking at the trailer one time, and I'm probably missing some stuff thats in there, but my point is this, they implied and told plenty in the trailer.

I guess it was better to adapt for western audiences and not have any Asian lead roles again.¬† Hollywood really likes to appropriate from Japanese or Asian/Eastern cultures but always sees the inhabitants as others and not worth integrating.

Last month I discovered a manga adaptation of it, but after reading the first 5 chapters, I wasn't really impressed. I mean they did relatively well, but it looks too childish and doesn't convey the despair of that situation very well. ¬†¬† This movie though, haha, is an absolute disgrace. They made up car and bike chases to add meaningless action, removed helmets for most scenes so that your precious star faces could get more screen-time, added weird moving guns to the armor, made the armor look really stupid (as opposed to how it's described in the book) and added stupid ambiguos/grand/apocalyptic dialogue (not one word of what they said is from the novel). ¬†¬† Almost forgot, Tom is 30 years too old for this role and Emily is too tall for her's and both their generic acting sucks.

Having that in mind, did you really expect the movie version follow the source material that closely?¬†  Since they're going for a more realistic approach (remember this is not just an aesthetic choice, but also something necessary in order to make special effects viable) I'd say the Jackets looks fine IMO, since it's actually supposed to be a mass produced piece of equipment. Considering that, a HUGE battle axe would also look completely out place. Remember that Starship Troopers movie completely dropped the power suit present in the original novel but still managed to be one hell of a movie.¬†  You could wait for a terrible Japanese Live Action movie, with some cheap CG and terrible acting, but while far from perfect, I'd say a Hollywood version is still better than the alternative.",1,0,Vipus2501,vw61gCe2oqI,0.10207359307359308,2014-03-02 12:25:19,True,True

I still don't know how the characters got to the ending, and plenty of times the events leading up to the climax make the ending much more emotional and satisfying.

2014-06-07T00:43:23,"Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after 'Battle L.A.' and 'Oblivion' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as 'Groundhog Day'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.  Most unexpected of all, the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well, is Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise's meatiest role since his turn in 'Magnolia' as Frank T.J. Mackey; forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes: here he plays an entirely different character ‚Äì and he really seems to relish the opportunity. I won't give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.  Yet while this is not nearly as bleak as the trailers suggested, it certainly isn't a comedy either. And it absolutely IS an action-packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion (the trailers got that right), albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. Speaking of which, the rest of the cast is also very good, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real; here she succeeds in portraying her character - a tough, seasoned soldier other soldiers refer to as ""full metal bitch"" (no kidding!) - with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great (as usual), character-wise, they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before.  As for the Sci-Fi spectacle that the trailers promised, I'm glad to report that the film delivers. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated (not the Transformer-style blur where you can't make out anything anymore), and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in 'Saving Private Ryan' - without the gore, obviously (after all, this is PG-13). The design of the aliens - the production design in general - is incredibly well done, although I would lie if I said it was something ground-breaking and new the way the first 'Matrix' was (it IS breathtaking, though).  So my verdict: With one of the most inventive (adapted) scripts for an original (mega-budget) film in a long time and the best Tom Cruise we've seen in years, 'Edge of Tomorrow' will have you chuckle and laugh nearly as much as drop your jaw in awe: this is what Hollywood should take as a blueprint for exciting summer entertainment henceforth. 9 stars out of 10.",0,0,hellwell777,vw61gCe2oqI,0.2516956228956229,2014-06-07 00:43:23,False,True

Potential plot holes in the time reset thing aside, what really bothered me is the complete lack of realism in how humanity dealt with the aliens. Everyone knows we'd be sending swarms of drones & (cruise) missiles equipped with tactical and strategic nukes, not soldiers in clunky power armor. To basically use WW2-era tactics in the 21st century is ridiculous. Reminds me of Starship Troopers, where their 'strategy' consisted of sending poorly organized soldiers armed with ARs against the alien hordes, instead of assraping them from the air with drone strikes or sending in expendable autonomous ground vehicles or humanoid robots (hey, it's the future and they have spaceships n stuff, so why not advanced robots?).¬†  These aliens, which incidentally look totally unoriginal, basically Matrix Sentinels mashed up with a bunch of other cliches, only have some kind of (homing?) missiles and melee capabilities. Find a way to confuse or otherwise neutralize their missiles and they'd be sitting ducks against air attacks. Sending in (human) ground forces is about the dumbest thing you can do. I know, it adds drama to the movie, but the total lack of realism is grating.¬†  Also, why didn't the aliens invade England sooner?

The trailer is probably one of the most well done trailer ever made that makes you think "" wow this is gonna be so epic & there is no way this movie will be a letdown "" but like srsly. Also the trailer is hella misleading, it makes you think Godzilla is the actual threat, but no it's the Mutos. Ye, those are gonna send us back to stone age. -.- Mutos got more screen time than Godzilla. They probably should have just called this movie Muto. The first half is a bore fest. In fact, things don't really pick up until about 90 minutes in. Every time you think a fight is going to happen the movie just cuts to something else. I was astounded. It wasn't even the lack of Godzilla fighting that made this movie boring to watch, it was the lack of Godzilla doing anything at all.¬†  If you like drama + alot of side stories and 5 minutes of action then this is the right movie for you! Ye, I am kinda angry now since I am a huge Godzilla fan, but this movie was a huge disappointment. The biggest disappointment I have seen so far this year. What was the director thinking while making this movie?   Best - Edge of Tomorrow  I went in with low expectations and came out speechless. Hell I am not a Tom Cruise fan and tbh I don't like his movies at all, but this movie was so good - words can't even describe how epic this movie is. You have to see it to know what's up lol. No srsly, in case you haven't seen it yet, go and see it! The trailer was kinda "" ye hm looks like a decent movie with some cool special effects and explosions "" but it's so much better than this.¬†  I don't wanna spoil anything here lol, just go and see it yourself.

2014-06-25T02:18:00,"*SPOILERS* Soooo one of the plausible explanations for the confusing ending would be...  Whenever an Alpha dies, Omega resets time to an earlier point when the Alpha is alive, and lets it retain the memory from the previous loop so it can do better in this new instance. After Cage killed the Alpha on the beach, and got poured with its blood, he became the Alpha and replaced it in all the following loops. That's why we don't see the Alpha again on the beach in all of the later loops. At the moment, "" Wake up, maggot"", the Alpha on the beach dies right away because it is replaced by Cage in this instance. At the end of the movie, Cage killed the Omega and got the blood too, he then again became the Omega and replaced it in the new loop. So when he woke up in the chopper, that exact moment, the Omega dies, because in this instance it is replaced by Cage.  The explanation about Cage being brought back further in time to him being in the chopper rather than his original first loop to "" Wake up, maggot."" would be the fact that whenever he is brought back to "" Wake up, maggot"", he dies on the day of the beach battle or during the beach battle. But what happened when he killed the Omega was, he died on the night before the beach battle, so maybe that is why he is brought back a day earlier during the time reset loop as well.",0,0,gohs9638793h,vw61gCe2oqI,0.06667158598976781,2014-06-25 02:18:00,False,True

EOT restores the realism and mundanity to action blockbusters. While questioning the untouchable nature of an action hero. Reality would have set in ling ago.   At just how impossible a task your up against. I mean i cringe to think how many times i would have gone through this to no avail. For yet another meeting with the Undertaker lol.  EOT provides an excellent opportunity to question what a life is worth in these films. If some of you were on the fence about seeing this. I fully recommend you do.

Cage then becomes an Alpha of sorts, because killing him will also make the Omega reset the day. Now, why is it that only Cage learns from its mistakes, changes his tactics, knows where the enemy will appear, etc., and not the Omega? Cage even memorizes where the mimics will attack, what shows that the Omega is simply repeating the day without changing a thing. And it is not that the Omega cannot change anything... the visions are a change, and they appear after many resets.

2015-03-01T06:38:46,Edge of tomorrow and oblivion same storyline almost.  Tom Cruise remembers something from past in oblivion even though his memory wiped out.  In edge of tomorrow he is supposed to forget that he went to war already but he still remembers.  (coz he is the Tom Cruise he has good memory)  In both movies they sort of blow up the alien headquarters or source to get rid of them.

But this movie wasn't like this. The story is actually very interesting. Tom and Emily are also great in it. Do not judge the movie based on this trailer.

Because, I thought it would be terrible and the main character wasn't like Keiji, his nationality being different and kind of pissed me off since Rita is the same, but probably it's because she is American in the manga too. But in the other day, I watched it on TV and what can I say is: wow. It isn't bad after all. It‚Äôs good! But for me, the manga is still more entertaining since it's the original story. Edge of tomorrow it's completely different from All you need is kill, the main character haves another personality, another name, another nationality. The plot is not the same, even thought that the principal idea is the same. I recommend all of you to read the manga! It's really good! Even thought, it haves other ending.

I have seen 4 more time loop movies apart from GHD and EOT, hard to say which was best, I do love TC movies and EOT was still pretty good, probably best of the 6 TL movies I've seen.  I did enjoy them all at the end of the day, Primer was way too overcomplicated to the point of not being too enjoyable, About Time is great if you prefer avoiding violence and special effects, Source Code is a nice watch, and while The Triange (2009) is a bit bloody it's probably my next fav after EOT because of its mindfucking ability which is not taken to extreme like Primer and there is at least some action, making it probably the most memorable one for me of the six.  If The Source with its reincarnation feature counted as a time loop movie it would win obviously, but then if you are looking for timeloopers specifically then it would probably disappoint.

2018-11-19T22:23:26,"This movie not only is based off a great manga called ""All You Need Is Kill"", but it also has ties to Norse mythology.    NORSE MYTHOLOGY  In the V√∂lsunga Saga the main character is a man named Sigurd/Siegfried he has a long story but I'll mention the important parts. Sigurd kills a dragon and bathes in its blood to gain invulnerability, he also eats it's heart to gain wisdom, intellect, and the ability to communicate with animals.     The gods reward him by giving him a bride that is imprisoned in a fortress with a moat of fire protecting it. The bride is a Valkyrie (a Norse battle angel sent by the gods) with red hair, who disobeyed orders and didn't kill the right person in battle, so her power was stripped from her and she was put in a comatose prison. Sigurd kisses her, she wakes up, falls in love with him, and (for reasons that aren't relevant to the movie) she kills him.       [[[[ WARNING SPOILERS BELOW ]]]]      EDGE OF TOMORROW    In Edge of Tomorrow, Cage is showered in the Alpha's (Dragon) blood; gets invulnerability via time loop to overcome any foe;  gains wisdom through dying, sacrificing, and seeing others do so; gets intellect from training and strategizing with Rita; and gets communication with the Omega (another species) via telepathy, and (arguably) Rita via time spent with her and being able to relate to her in a way no one else can because of the time loop power.    In the movie Cage first meets Rita by going through the wall of fire that is the battlefield. Rita herself has red hair, red armor, and is known as ""The Angel of Verdun"" (in the manga she's even known as ""The Valkyrie""). She had supernatural powers but they were lost when she didn't kill the right person, herself. She becomes distant and secludes herself from everybody but her techy friend. Eventually Cage gets to know her over his months in the time loop and falls in love with her, she eventually falls in love with him in what is only a day for her, bringing her out of her solitude. Also, she kills Cage. Like a lot.     5/5 for science fiction Norse mythology adaptation.",0,0,Casey,vw61gCe2oqI,0.22523809523809524,2018-11-19 22:23:26,False,False

I didn't know what I wanted to make of myself, that I was too afraid to admit that I was only a speck of what I perceived myself as. Blaming them was just a pernicious way I could relieve myself of the responsibility of forging for myself a better life.  Live, Die, Repeat. I was too afraid to start phase two.

What I mean by this is that he doesn't fly F-14's with Goose, he's not a race car driver, he's not Ethan Hunt... he's a wimp that does publicity stunts to basically generate war bonds so he can avoid fighting... so essentially he's a coward.  This is totally unlike his other movies where he can defeat just about anyone or anything at the towering height of 5'7"" tall.  I like it how he grows into his character by starting off as a wimp and going from there to be a soldier, again unlike his other movies.  I also love how it's like playing a video game, as I love playing Halo, and it's basically like playing a level, dying and restarting it again yet learning what you did wrong and how you can get better and better until you eventually beat the game.  Lastly, Emily Blunt is in the movie, so it's difficult not to like a movie that she's in, especially when she's such a badass.",4,0,65FASTBACKMAN,vw61gCe2oqI,0.02583333333333334,2019-05-02 20:34:01,False,False
