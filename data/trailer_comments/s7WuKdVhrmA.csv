2018-01-20T10:09:40,"Wind River is a film that seemed to pass everyone by when it got it's theatrical release back in September . I'm not sure if that's because it is a Weinstein film and Harvey had a little bit more on his plate than promoting it ?! It's also won awards for the most overlooked film of 2017 so I fully expect it to be talked about more now it has been released for home viewing.  It's the story of a ranger who discovers the frozen body of a young Native American woman in an Indian Reservation. She turns out to be the best friend of his teenage daughter, who died a few years earlier under mysterious circumstances. Although the tribal authorities get involved in the investigation, the FBI also sends in rookie agent to investigate.  This is the second film in a row I have watched that involves Native Americans dealing with death and the grief that comes with it ( the other was Hostiles ). This is the better film of the two in my opinion. It's very atmospheric and you really do feel the harshness of the environment these people have to deal with. This is probably Jeremy Renner's best performance to date as the dad who is still dealing with the death of his daughter but I was not totally convinced that Elizabeth Olsen was the best choice for an FBI agent.

This movie clearly references Louis Erdrich's main character June Kashpaw as she too dies while trying to get to safety in a snowstorm. Wind River is horrifically truthful and so real. Graham Greene, outstanding! The entire cast did an excellent job! Elizabeth Olsen, really shines in this movie. She is the caring fire and spirit of the victim who could no longer speak.

She ran 6 miles barefoot. In the SNOW!""--- Feel the Heart breaking    Here And Here  Here.   There is always this sense in these sparse dangerous regions that anything can and will happen. Oftentimes justice is nonexistent. People do and get away with anything. I experienced severe trauma in a place like this. There were some very very good people. And some very very bad. When the realization comes over a person that there is no Law to call--that one's life hangs upon absolute choices that must be made oftentimes on instinct alone and acted upon immediately or there really could be dying. It shakes you to the bone. One does not ever shake off the feeling of intense danger and fear. Ever.  Yes, far too many Native American women disappear!!! And who is looking for them?

It carries such an important message, one that definitely needs to be known to more people and make them aware of the sickening and frustrating reality that exists for a lot of Native Americans!  The movie was beautifully shot, it captured the eerie isolation of the reservation, the icy cold, the rough life and the beauty of the vast mountain nature perfectly. The writing was amazing as well, the actors did a great job and I'm glad J.Renner and E.Olsen are taking these smaller indie movie roles and not just rely on the huge franchise movies, so they can highlight and show their full potential as actors ! The story had me clued to the TV from the get go and it got more and more suspenseful, incredibly sad and brutal, some scenes were difficult to watch. It also made me very upset and frustrated when I realized that this is indeed not far from reality (it probably even has a way ""happier"" ending than real life, which makes it even more infuriating) and it's an issue that needs more attention. The enormous injustice and lack of equal laws, when it comes to persecuting crimes against Native Americans, committed on their land, is something that desperately needs to be changed. I can't believe this is still a reality for Native Americans! As a European, I didn't know about it, except for the many horrible countless unsolved murders on the ""Highway of Tears"" in Canada which tells me that not enough has been done there, as well.
