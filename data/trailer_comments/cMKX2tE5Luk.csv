2017-09-13T01:48:12,"God loved each of us so much that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to bear our sin and die in our place. “God demonstrates His love toward us, in that, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). Although we cannot understand how, God said our sins were laid upon Jesus and He died in our place. Jesus became our substitute. In the Bible, a jailer asked his prisoners, Paul and Silas: “’Sirs, what must I do to be saved?’ So they said, ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved.’” (Acts 16:30-31). It’s very clear in the Bible, believe in Jesus as the one who bore your sins, died in your place, was buried, and whom God resurrected. It’s Christ’s blood and resurrection that assures us of everlasting life when we call on Him as our Lord and Savior. ""For whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved."" (Romans 10:13). “Whosoever” includes each and every one of us. but theres a eternal conmdenatin call hell, and separation from God.Therefore, if you understand that you are a sinner, and you believe that Jesus Christ came as the one and only Redeemer of sin, then you understand the plan of salvation. The question is – are you ready to implement the plan, by receiving God’s gift of His Son, Jesus Christ? If so, believe in Christ, repent of your sins, and commit the rest of your life to Him as Lord:“Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.”""Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.""

The Disaster Artist is probably my favourite book of the 2010's thus far, however I find Seth Rogen and James Franco to be lack lister actors with the exception of Freaks & Geeks. Franco's inflections and mannerism (from this admittedly short preview) are at times very Wiseau-like while others seem so far removed from Tommy it is off-putting. However, I am usually skeptical regarding things I am very fond of, so I am still excited despite my concerns.  I will say I am more excited for Best F(r)iends and the possible small part Tommy plays in this movie. 😉",0,1,Sour Eggz,cMKX2tE5Luk,0.18666666666666665,2017-09-14 05:26:21,True,True

The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear, That never object pleasing in thine eye, That never touch well welcome to thy hand, That never meat sweet-savored in thy taste, Unless I spake, or looked, or touched, or carved to thee. How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it, That thou art then estrangèd from thyself? Thyself I call it, being strange to me, That, undividable, incorporate, Am better than thy dear self's better part. Ah, do not tear away thyself from me! For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall A drop of water in the breaking gulf, And take unmingled thence that drop again Without addition of diminishing, As take from me thyself and not me too. How dearly would it touch thee to the quick, Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious, And that this body, consecrate to thee, By ruffian lust should be contaminate! Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me, And hurl the name of husband in my face, And tear the stained skin off my harlot-brow, And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring, And break it with a deep-divorcing vow? I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it. I am possessed with an adulterate blot; My blood is mingled with the crime of lust. For if we two be one, and thou play false, I do digest the poison of thy flesh, Being strumpeted by thy contagion. Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed; I live disdained, thou undishonorèd.   Oh hi mark.",0,0,Kav Pk,cMKX2tE5Luk,0.26268939393939394,2017-09-18 08:09:39,True,True

2017-10-12T01:50:40,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The room. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Tommy Wiseau's Clever wordplay most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Johnny's Optimistic Outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Oh Hi Mark literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Room truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humor in Tommy's existential catchphrase “ah ha ha ha,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Johnny's secret depression. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tommy Wiseau's genius wit unfolds itself on their Movie screens.
