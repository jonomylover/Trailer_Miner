2017-05-06T20:06:31,"THE BEAUTIFUL HANDS OF THE PRIEST  We need them in life's early morning, We need them again at its close; We feel their warm clasp of true friendship, We seek them when tasting life's woes. At the altar each day we behold them, And the hands of a king on his throne Are not equal to them in their greatness; Their dignity stands all alone; And when we are tempted and wander, To pathways of shame and of sin, It's the hand of a priest that will absolve us-- Not once, but again and again. And when we are taking life's partner, Other hands may prepare us a feast, But the hand that will bless and unite us-- Is the beautiful hand of a priest. God bless them and keep them all holy, For the Host which their fingers caress; When can a poor sinner do better, Than to ask Him to guide thee and bless? When the hour of death comes upon us, May our courage and strength be increased, By seeing raised over us in blessing-- The beautiful hands of a priest.  ALTER CHRISTUS  The Roman Catholic Church teaches that her priests are ""Alter Christus,"" which means literally ""another Christ."" Because Christ is God, this is a most serious claim. One would expect to hear such a claim from the false pagan religions, but from a supposedly Christian religion? Here's some evidence for you to consider.   ""The priest is indeed another Christ, or in some way he is himself a continuation of Christ.""  (Pope Pius XI, Encyclical on the Priesthood).   ""The priest on earth (is) another Christ."" (The New Saint Joseph Baltimore Catechism.)   ""In this moment, the priest quite literally becomes Christ Himself.""  (This is the Mass, Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, Page 100)   ""The priest is not just the cross, he is Christ Himself.""  (The Lone Star Catholic, March 1, 1959)  ""To the carnal eye, the priest looks like other men, but to the eye of faith he is exalted above angels.""  (Faith of our Fathers, Gibbons, Page 422)   ""Another grace of the synod [Synod of Bishops, October, 1990] was a new maturity in the way of looking at priestly service in the Church; and thus also of the personal life of each and every priest, that is to say, of each priest's participation in the saving mystery of Christ: 'Sacerdos Alter Christus.'""   (Pope John Paul II, Letter to Catholic priests on the occasion of Holy Thursday, 1991).   ""The priest is given transcendent power to forgive sins, to administer the sacraments, but most of all to offer the Eucharistic Sacrifice, the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, in which he becomes an 'Alter Christus'""  (Pastoral Reflections on the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass [http://www.cny.org/archives/cv092498.htm], Cardinal John J. O'Conner.)   ""In the sacrifice of Jesus Christ the priest is a substitute of Christ Himself. As a result of his ordination, he is a true alter Christus.""  (The Latin Mass: Chronicle of a Catholic Reform, Summer 1995 Issue [http://www.latinmassmagazine.com/stickler.html]. )   ""Thus the priest, as is said with good reason, is indeed another Christ;""  (Papal Encyclical 'Ad Catholici Sacerdotii' on the priesthood, Pope Pius XI, December 20, 1935)   “What did the Pedophile Roman Catholic Priest say to the Altar boy, as he buggered him in the Sacristy”?  “Body of Christ”!  THE FISH ROTS FROM THE HEAD DOWN  In his Book of Gomorrah, Saint Peter Damian first attacks the problem of clerical moral laxity and sexual perversions from the top down beginning with members of the Catholic hierarchy, that is, bishops and religious superiors who turn a blind eye to the moral depravity within the ranks of clerics and monks under their rule. When he speaks of “do-nothing” superiors, the reader can almost feel the earth shake under him:  Listen, you do-nothing superiors of clerics and priests. Listen, and even though you feel sure of yourselves, tremble at the thought that you are partners in the guilt of others; those, I mean, who wink at the sins of their subjects that need correction and who by ill-considered silence allow them license to sin. Listen, I say, and be shrewd enough to understand that all of you alike are deserving of death, that is, not only those who do such things, but also they who approve those who practice them",0,0,Bobby English,56jw6tasomc,0.13923961840628504,2017-05-06 20:06:31,False,False
