2018-12-09T08:02:05,This child seems possessed in a way. If this kid is evil and is like Superman someone is going to need to kill this demon spawn by Kryptonite or shove a sword into his mouth down into his stomach and start twisting like a blender hopefully his insides are a weak point... When the mom says there‚Äôs still good in you that dumb he‚Äôs a monster not like a rapist or a murderer but an actual monster with ingrained evil he need to be killed or he will wipe out humanity. Josh forbid there‚Äôs more like him and it ends with an invasion because he sends a signal. I partially blame his parents they should have sat him down and told him the truth when he was young. This is what happens when you hide a big secret from your own kids about themselves they find out and sometimes go nuts in his case he becomes a monster that kills everything and anything in sight... And taking something like him to school is a bad idea school is like the worst environment for blossoming monsters like him it‚Äôs best to go to a small school or homeschool him. He also needs friends growing up to know how to interact. When he feels comfortable enough to go to school allow him and if he‚Äôs having problems sit down and let him talk to you.  Actually no I don‚Äôt blame him for going nuts his parents hid the truth from him isolated him from friends force him to go into a really bad environment with bullies and people that don‚Äôt help him no wonder he goes over the edge.  This wouldn‚Äôt of happened if his parents told him the truth when he was young let him have friends homeschooled him and let him gradually become comfortable enough to go to school and talk to him when he has problems. But no they hide the truth from him and pretend everything is OK and look what that leads to him becoming a monster.,2,1,Micaela Roquemore,g6eB0JT1DI4,-0.06264367816091952,2018-12-09 08:02:05,True,True

2018-12-11T09:38:38,This is basically ultraman without connection to dc multiverse. Ppl don‚Äôt know: during new 52 run there was a comic event called forever evil where the crime syndicate of earth-3 invaded earth 1. That earth version of Superman is known as ultraman and from his origins he basically made his adopted parents as slaves and eventually he killed them when they try to stop him. This is that. The boy will kill his parents when they see him as a threat and if he lives at end of film then he will conquer the world. What would be interesting is if the film somehow does really well and Sony likes if then they could attempt to make their own version of earth 3 with the main field being villains that are bad counterparts of good heroes ppl know of.  There is even a book series (and this year a board game that‚Äôs part of it) that I forgot the name but all the ppl with powers are evil and they conquer the world with the powerless ppl trying to fight back using special tech against them.,0,0,dungeonmaster16,g6eB0JT1DI4,-0.059321789321789324,2018-12-11 09:38:38,True,True

Your leaders propagate fear and now your entertainment takes a bright light of hope and darkens it for a dollar. Taking no consideration of the influence this will have on the population in its current soft and fearful state. Some may say its just a movies, but those smart enough to understand the human mind, we know that the writing of super heroes and villains can play a large part in peoples perspectives on life. Do not let the entertainment business kill what made Superman human. He grew up with compassion for those who could not otherwise save, or defend themselves from greater evils. He did not rampage and kill because he didn't understand who he was. His parents saw to him understanding that he was different the responsibility it meant and they set him on a path that made him more human than humanity itself. Superman is a portrayal of the best of us and how alien that can be in a world filled with fear and evil intent. Sony pictures is going to far, and if you have any humanity left in you, do not go see this film. Stand with Superman as a world community, I ask you please send Sony and this director a message.

I think that maybe the boy is the last living of another species that was sent to earth to destroy it and ""re-colonize"" it for his original species. Plus in this trailer we see that the kid eats a fork and in the 2nd trailer we see he's immune to metal(metal cant damage him) when he stops the blade of the lawnmower with his fingers. So my theory is that his species couldnt adapt to earth's resources and stuff like that so they sent him to adapt to it and then destroy all humans for the new species to arrive.

So with him gaining these new powers was did scare him like the scene with the fork. Now as we all know from superman green kryptonite weakens him physically but the  Red kryptonite effect the emotional state, making him angry and evil. So if the red glow was the Red kryptonite then that could explain him turning evil and being picked on doesn't help. Now with that mark it looks extremly close to the berserk mark, now for all of those who don't know berserk's mark is the brand of sacrifice, now the brand sacrificed, someone close and important to the summoner, are then offered to creatures of the darkness. so cause the kid was exposed to the red glow and if it is going to be based on superman then he was drawn to it and it was causeing him to suffer emotionaly, so thats where the brand could come in. to sacificed someone close to the summoner and the summon could be the boy offers his mother. I'M not sure about the father. Now of course we all know if you mess with the darkness and offer them something they will take over your body so the kid could be prossed and been devourd by a demon.

Well, to point it out clearly to whoever miss it if anyone really miss it.... Now let me explain. First to compare a similar movie, the superman... In this version it was the lady who taught the ""alien boy/Superboy"" human western's moral concept. While in Superman version, it was Clark adopted dad who adopt him who taught ""alien boy/ Clark"" human western's moral concept. Now if you had watch the trailer for this movie, with the concept being taught by the lady in this movie. she taught the boy that he was a gift, point out that he was different without any child reinforce to assure the child who suffering identity crisis to be strong, and she even rub the ego about how the kid was special. Okay so, if in real life you overpraise a kid like the same way like this lady in this trailer did, obviously you'll create a monster who think he is special, who above other, had a unique gift who no on in the world could go against him. You'll create a antithesis hero. Now, let compare how clark fair in his world. He got a supporting dad like this lady in this video. But, the main thing that is different is the way how Clark dad taught him moral ideology to support him to be a man who should learn to take responsibility for his action. In conclusion if you still don't understand. This movie is pointing out that in the case of Women Vs Man moral teaching to a hero, thing sure take a wrong turn. I haven't watch the movie yet but just based in the trailer, this is how the trailer transcribe in a weird sense to me.",0,0,Thai Vang,g6eB0JT1DI4,0.0878968253968254,2019-05-01 02:38:06,True,True
