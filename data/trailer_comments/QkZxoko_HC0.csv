Religion, spirituality rationalizes external forces manipulating you, keeps you in an unknown realm of victimization. There are no rules or paths. There is no Heaven, the afterlife is a trap simulation. They want us in a miasma of hypno-bliss to control. Our bodies are considered vessels for the DNA to affix the 21 gram soul energy. They reincarnate as Humans to push their agenda, theyre bloodline matchmakers. Their DNA is old, it hit a wall, they tweaked it for math skillz & lost empathy. Our DNA is new and universal, it was designed for interstellar resiliency, empathy, and beauty. Since you havent been abducted or contacted, its not opulent sociopaths. The aliens don't tell us about themselves, they tell us how we should live. They don't abduct the homeless or sick, they don't cure, they take. Theyre instituting a silent invasion, situated among us, playing both sides. They disguise as Humans. DNA is biocomputer code to make a Human-looking hologram. They manifest matter, cloak their craft like Human aircraft. They wrote the religions, calendars, occult, secret societies, political cultures, & states. They operate a 5th Column online, news, Hollywood, every industry & major city. Millions of non-Humans live among us. The aliens arent showing themselves not due to lack of believers, theyre waiting until we're ripe. Breeding generations are quick with a two-digit lifespan being. Our genome is the master genome of diversity & beauty, yet all Human history has been their concentration camp to get the uncoded/junk DNA that we're evolving fit for alien exploitation, giving us short lifespans, feeding us breeding propaganda, theyre anti-homosexual, & using religious fear to control the Kundalini evolution. Eugenics. It's militaristic thinking disguised with PR & a complete disregard for Human sovereignty. The Arcturians & Galactic Federation are responsible for all evil, fomenting war, designing water, money, viral population control, decreasing the lifespan & mental capabilities of all Humanity. Four digit lifespans, 200 IQ, & telepathy are the rule in this universe. We're the surface dwellers on Earth. Our blood will be in the new bodies of reincarnated aliens. This is a farm. They operate locally & from the psychic weapon, soul capture & reincarnation processing station of the artificial moon. They think they own & have right to our genome. The secret sauce: What shapes psychology shapes your current reproductive materials. History has been shaped to shape Human DNA. Epigenetics. Socio-genetic feedback loop. DNA can't be grown in a lab, manifested, or bought at the store. This, all this is the lab, their trauma is the program, we are the store. You gotta get real & look around at the basic foundation for the successful fucking survival of every life form: DNA. They will lie, cheat, & kill to get what they want. What chimps are to us, we are to them. They see our death as a non issue. They think theyve the right to abduct any Human on US federal property. Revoke all soul contracts with them, disagree with anything they do. Theyre operating an invasion, now acting covert, then disguised as contact. Theyre using dream & mind control through psychic tech, physical or etheric implants for mind body control & possession, Machiavellian psych warfare, impostering key positions with AI, Human holograms, or Human-looking aliens, controlling miscarriage, gender, & soul of newborns, sending soul reincarnations into a specific family group to further their fake spiritual agenda, ramping up the rape speed of the hybrid program for the resiliency of their races, using our Human genome until the eradication of our bloodline.",0,0,A.G.

He actually becomes the character he is playing. He spends hours and days and weeks doing homework so he can bring the best embodiment of the character to the screen. He learns accents and foreign languages just to play a role. He gained a lot of weight to look more like the real Tony Lip. He should have won an Oscar long ago. I hope the academy is finally paying attention to this incredible actor and give him his due. I know he doesnt care that much but I want him to get the recognition he deserves.

Sure. Maybe 1 in 1000. But that's probably the same proportion of murderer, thief, or rapist. Bad, yes. But not some national crisis. Don't believe it? See the #WalkAway movement and footage of Trump rallies. Salt n pepper.)  If you think ""this movie is what the country needs right now"", you are drinking the propaganda koolaid. Although the overall message will be something like ""we're all the same on the inside"", the REALITY is you will be exposed to ALL the scenes in the film that remind you of racism. And after the movie makes a big debut, there will be talk shows and radio spots with activists saying things like, ""this is a reminder that racism is real and we need to be have a discussion about it...."" Remember, slavery was abolished and rights for blacks was won. Why are we still going on about it?  Imagine when slavery was abolished and a slave owner opened his gates.

2018-12-23T12:50:58,"Loved this movie - really great!  I loved how the black man was trying to get the white man to take more advantage of what he could be and have, that he was missing opportunities.  Not that he was gong to change him.  But I think about black people today walking, talking and acting in a stereotypical ""black"" manner.    That stereotype didn't exist before the late 60's early 70's (watch the TV show Goodtimes about a black family - the mother, father, daughter and youngest son all acted and talked like Americans.  The older son ""JJ"" had the ""black"" affection.  It never really existed before then, and has remained since then.  John Amos, the father character demanded they change it as it was demeaning to black people, they refused, and he left the show).    I think those who choose to engage as such are limiting their opportunities to break into better paying jobs, just as Tony wasn't about to get a white collar job by walking, talking and acting like a goomba.  Opportunities exist for all people to make something better of themselves regardless of color, race, gender, etc.  But you have to choose it.  One thing that helps to move up beyond kitchen/restaurant/janatorial/barrister, etc work., is don't put tattoos all over you skin that are visible in work clothes.  If executives don't do it/have it, and you wish to keep yourself open to such executive positions some day, than don't do it.  Walk, talk and maintain yourself in such a way you can fit into better paying jobs.  Because if you don't, there will be someone else of your same color, race, gender, ethnicity, skin condition who does.    Some might think these thoughts are racist - if I was racist, I'd keep that tidbit to myself to try to keep others from moving up.",0,0,Liberty Chick,QkZxoko_HC0,0.09888888888888887,2018-12-23 12:50:58,False,True

He was never disassociated with other Black people. He was a child prodigy and a highly intellectual and intelligent man and fluent in about 8 languages. The movie would‚Äôve been 1,000 times better if they told the real story about Dr. Don Shirley but THEN they would‚Äôve had to market it as a Black film. That would be too much like right for Hollywood to portray any Black character in a positive light.

2019-02-03T03:27:45,"In my humble opinion, Best Movie movie of the year. This film provided me with more entertainment than I expected. Loved the way the writer takes us into the lives, based on two ""real-life"" men. One an Italian American, circa 1960's, with little education, very biased, and who displays a very thug- like way of expressing himself. The other, a highly educated man, former child prodigy, who goes on to earn a doctorate in music.  Because of the racism that existed in the deep South, during that era, this talented pianist,  is barred from many southern, upscale hotels, and restaurants, because some folks found his skin color offensive. It was both heartwarming, and emotional, to watch how the author, slowly educates the wise guy from the Bronx to develop a deep sense of protection, love, respect and appreciation for the man who employed him as a valet and chauffeur.  And in turn, It was also very emotional to watch the deep pain and loneliness the musician silently endures. Throughout the film, I found myself wiping my eyes. The performances by both Viggo Mortensen, and Mahershara Ali, was nothing short of Brilliant. It would shock me deeply, if this movie, does not earn Oscars for best screenplay, best direction, best production, best actor, and best supporting actor.

You'd have to actually know about this movie and plan seeing it a day prior to actually know what it is. Great movie, not a masterpiece but this movie certainly deserved better than that kind of treatment. To think that they only played it twice in one day (3pm and 8pm) and made it share the same showroom as BUMBLEBEE that's been playing there for almost a month now in three other separate show rooms, showed how very little hope they had for this movie to make any money. Alita and Bumblebee took up the entire cinema with gigantic posters and trailer previews outside the mall and they can't even give the green book it's own projection room. Nobody else saw it but me. I planned on seeing it for months now but it took a while to get here so I was in time for the first screening. I've never experienced watching a movie in the cinema, literally all alone. I don't think they even expected anyone to see it cause when I went in, they turned on all the lights and the projector was out of focus.

2019-02-20T04:44:09,"I'm a bit confused about exactly what the controversy is with this film. For me it was a really good movie with a great message and amazing acting performances. I would agree that it doesn't make sense for Mahershala Ali to be only nominated for supporting actor, when he is in the movie nearly as much as Viggo Mortensen. But the film makers have obviously done what people have done other years and nominated Ali in the supporting category because they think he will have more chance of winning  in that one. Other statements I've seen be talked about are that the movie has a white savour complex within it, and that it is unfair how Viggo Mortensen's character is the one that the story is centred around. The films gives a pretty detailed account of both characters, with the exception of their being more detail about the Tony characters family, but it is obvious that Mortensen's character would be considered the lead. But I didn't feel that this really diminished Ali's character in any way. I thought his character was well written and very interesting and complex. Probably quite a bit more so than Mortensen's character. As for the white saviour complex people are suggesting the film includes. I don't it's fair to keep referring to this every time a white character does something to help a non white character. It would be pretty ignorant for the movie to ignore the fact that a white character would be treated better and would be more privileged and to ignore how this might help a situation. And people seem to miss that in a lot of the films accused of including this, the white character progresses to being a better person or challenges the way they think because of the non white character(s). I'm not sure exactly how this makes the white character come off as a hero or how it doesn't show non white characters in a good light. If anything to me it shows how white society has been in the past, and still can be pretty toxic and promote bad ideals in people. Mortensen's character uses his street smarts to help Ali's character. And I don't see anything wrong with that. He did what any bodyguard would do, because essentially he was acting as a body guard amongst other things. And even if he weren't, I can't really see wanting to see why trying to help another person regardless of race is a bad thing. For me it was more that Ali's character just wasn't the physical fighter type and Mortensen's character was. I saw it as more that they helped each other out in different ways, because they both had different strengths. I feel like I'm being made to feel like my way of viewing this movie is from the ignorant and white perspective. But I don't quite see how the way I viewed it could be thought of as very ignorant. Unless I'm buying into the heartwarming feel good aspect of the films ending and that's a problem. And I just don't see why exactly people have chosen to criticise this film so much. I was hoping this would be a major contender for Best Picture but with people stirring up controversy about it, it seems pretty unlikely.",0,0,Natalie Bruce,QkZxoko_HC0,0.1342391304347826,2019-02-20 04:44:09,False,False

Both communities had a lot in common: Discrimination from the majority white population upon arrival from Europe.

The scene where their car got a flat in front of black slaves working in a field summed up the mentality of the average black person currently living in the United States: The male slaves who stood in the field staring at the black passenger and his white driver had the opportunity to jump over the fence separating and try to escape by asking for a ride, but instead chose to stand there and just look. That's the reality that Black people in America are currently living: They have the ability to leave this country and return home to Africa like their ancestors who returned to Liberia a century ago, but they choose to remain here and complain about the racist treatment they receive at the hands of White Spremacists.",0,0,Mr1sonmontuno,QkZxoko_HC0,-0.023611111111111107,2019-02-25 16:04:17,False,False

Its all about big block buster and action packed tough guy crap, fast car and ego driven garbage.

A lot of people in America have this tendency to be stupid, ignorant and racist and Hollywood through the years helped really well to give people a wrong image of Italians. We probably created the most beautiful and cultural stuff in this world. We know that Hollywood has been always dominated by certain √©lites or groups, that wanted to show Italians that way.

Gadhafi, may he rest in Peace, made his biggest mistake and yet his biggest vertue: he kept his people ignorant.But, peaceful and rich.They almost didn't pay for energy, water and food.I used to go to what was called""the Lybian market"".My mother bought always very good cheese from Holland, olive oil, milk in powder, Tuna that the Lybian government paid for up to 50 percent.It was good and cheap.Tunisians always get some of lybian wealth, especially the middle class and the poor ones.I'm a witness of this era.Democracy lenses give you always a polarised vision.Gadhafi was bad? No he wasn't, he was grey.The right man for the right period.He was appointed by God to protect the Lybian wealth from the European capitalist wolves.He did it well, until Sarkozy sent him his killers to cover up his election fraud, a very very very low attitude.That was his destiny. Now, Lybia, be careful, your gates are open and your wealth is leaking at an alarming rate.Lybia is meant to boost North Africa in the next era, to be the wealth engine that will shine on itself and its neibhors around, in a fair way. Russia, Emirates, Saoudis has shown that they are not looters.They are protectionnist political influencers, they don't need money, they are rich countries.The Europeans have used most of their ressources, they are declining.Americans are rich, but their gold is cursed, teinted with blood, it won't bring them good, they will end up fighting for it and killing themselves. The Wifa9 government was pushed by Europeans to get access to Lybia's wealth and secure them during the next era.It is not fair, Europe has its chance, now the ball moves forward. This is a warning to the Muslim Brotherhood: Qatar in particular: You are sovreign, make your own decisions, encourage a rapid settlment in Lybia, otherwise you will work against the East renaissance as a whole and the muslim renaissance particularly.Seek peace with Haftar, and cut the wealth leak.I will tell you what you risk from Haftar: he has a huge ego.He is a good military man, but has not the necessary strategic intelligence to be a good political leader.That is why I'm asking Russia in her own future interest to push for a settlment in Lybia by pushing the two sides to talks: Haftar will have the military command, Wifa9 people will be allowed to stay in Peace in Lybia and call for elections, leaders will be proposed.I suggest someone who is impartial, clever, national, and rational. The ""Democracy"" transition will work gradually, don't be on a hurry.People are wakening.Dictatorship is over in arab nations, only a matter of time. America has cut the brown giant arms to escape its destiny, but it only accelerated it. Their rulers have no idea( or they have, these bas#tards are quantum)what they did: the giant will grow iron fists, control matter itself, his fists are almost invincible, they were prepared by The Prophet to be the ones who will lead you right to Jesus and The antichrist, it is and was always their destiny: tough people.",0,0,sarah light,QkZxoko_HC0,0.16422296050203028,2019-11-11 09:41:07,False,False
