2018-03-29T03:20:38,"Seriously people, this is a movie that says and I quote ""Submitting is ducking so God can hit your husband."" and more than some random words sputtered by an utterly forgettable character that quote actually sums up one of the movies major themes. And let me tell you, of all the pieces of entertainment I've ever watched this has probably the worst relationship advice ever. In fact, I'm actually worried someone sees this and thinks this is exactly how they should behave.   In a real, healthy relationship no one should submit to anyone, both partners should be completely equal and communication should never be an issue, much less something one of the spouses is afraid of. If your partner does something that hurts, bothers or belittles you, then the best thing you can do is to talk to him or her about it. If you try to be reseonable and just start a normal, calm conversation and they simply end up making a fight out everything, even if it's easily the most sensible of complaints, then you're not the problem, they are. You didn't do anything wrong, they did. And please, please don't excuse such behaviors by saying ""he is a man, they don't like being nagged by their wives"" because that just ridiculous. Men are definitely not a bunch of rabid wild dogs ready to lash out at the tiniest of provocations, they are just as capable of being rational and of having reasonable conversations as women are.   If you really want to save your relationship, talk with your significant other, if things are really bad go see a marriage counselor. And if you don't want to be in that relationship anymore, there's no shame in asking for a divorce. And if your spouse abuses you physically or otherwise, please go seek help, go to the police or a shelter or just talk to a friend. Acting like a freaking doormat to your husband will hardly make things better in any of these situations.   And if you do believe in the power of prayer that's great. And if you decide to clear out your closet and use it to pray instead that's a fine too, I actually think it makes more sense to have a whole room to pray in than a whole room to put your clothes in (in my country people use wardrobes and that's enough). But remember that God can't do everything for you. If you pray to win the lottery you still have to go buy a ticket, if you pray to save your relationship you still have work on it, you can't just expect things to miraculously fall on your lap.",12,2,Syns,2DbRwcrhiLA,0.08083333333333335,2018-03-29 03:20:38,False,False

In this century, in the name of feminism, we want equality with man, but yes we get it, some part. But don't forget we are a woman. Why God created us different from man?? To complete each other. Doesn't mean we are the slave of man, no but we are their helper. Without us they can't, without them, we can't. In the Bible said husband love your wife. Wife respects your husband. We can't change our partner, tell them their mistake directly, you attack their pride. No, no, no that way. But in a different way. I know it's hard. You will say that, ""Are you insane, you let your partner abuse you, that's his mistake, etc"". But hey that's why like this old woman said we need a strategy. I know what I'm talking about and because I'm failed to know this movie. My relationship was broken cause I thought like that also, it's not my mistake, he doesn't care, so on and on etc. I thought I can repair my relationship if I told him like that but I was wrong. I destroy that. I lose him, his gone. So that's what I want to say that if you want to save your marriage, your relationship learns from this movie. This is the truth!

Obviously if he was beating her then YES get out. But God showed him what his behavior was doing and what it was going to do to his wife. She clearly still loved him, but didn't know how to love him. So Miss Clara showed her. The power in prey does work but it takes a lot of work.    Communicate and listen.
