2015-06-09T02:50:35,Let's shoot a prediction of how this movie plays out.  Wealthy upper-middle class desperate wife/gf and hubby/bf are having issues that lead to a break up or separation. While trying to put her life together she begins dating and runs into our psychopath.   Things start off hot and heavy with a few sex scenes but then his attitude changes. She takes the hint he's crazy and tries to dump him.  He then begins terrorizes her in every aspect of her life and just when she coincidentally starts patching things up with her ex.   The psychopath then hatches a plan to kill her or kill her husband which gets thwarted because he gives am unnecessarily long monologue about how he had something bad happen in his past which made him what he is today. It is then that one of the lovers attacks him and knocks him unconscious. Of course the woman gets the last hit and we all ride off in the sunset as long as the hubby didn't die.  That my prediction for the movie. Hmu when it comes out to tell me if I was right or wrong,0,0,Wartime Christian,CikoxQ4ytI4,-0.15816326530612243,2015-06-09 02:50:35,True,True

He seems to be the perfect guy until something happens and then he turns into some kind of maniac. She gets scared and goes to look for her ex, yeah, there was someone worse than her ex. They come back, but her new ex ( the ex perfect guy ) keeps harassing both of them. She goes to ask for help from the cops. Cops say they can't do anything until something really bad happens. I bet the girl has that best friend that may be her neighbour. So, the perfect bad guy keeps harassing everyone, he kills the female neighbour. I bet Morris Chestnut bites the dust halfway too, so the movie obviously must end with the final fight between the woman and the perfect guy. The woman should have a gun ( I assume a shotgun, based on a pic from imdb ). Bad guy manages to take away her gun and they fight until she finally kills him.
