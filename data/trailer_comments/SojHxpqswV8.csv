2019-02-01T00:57:02,"The trailor I seen on TV (though vague), seemed like it be really good but this was an ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE movie. I thought it would be good but it turned out to be totally shit. First of all, it was VERY BORING. The dialogue also wasn't that good and it had a TON of swearing in it and I could be wrong but I don't think Victorian people spoke like that. Atleast not that much. All you practically heard was CUNT, CUNT, CUNT, CUNT, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK which is REALLY UNNESSESARY. However the trailor shows all the best parts ofcourse to get you to go see it. Not the boring parts or innuendo.   Secondly, it was not even that funny. Certainly not funny enough for me to consider it a comedy and there was A LOT of FUCKING in this movie. Over 5 scenes of fucking... anal fucking, handjobs, masturbation and there was also women flashing their asses and tits. Not what I expected and I could be wrong again but I'm pretty sure this movie had a 15 rating. If so, IM SHOCKED. HIGHLY INNAPPROPRIATE movie for young teens of that age. Lesbians should also be offended by this movie as it can't seem to portray lesbians without making it all about fucking and making out that everyone in the Queens circle were rampant sex maniacs. It just makes out that this must be the only behavior and company lesbians keep.   Also another thing I did not like was a scene of animal cruelty. This however is just a personal preference and a warning to those sensitive, not a critique of the movie. Also another personal dislike was the sound effects.. VERY IRRATATING hearing people swallowing while drinking etc. There was also some scenes that tried to be funny but just made for annoying viewing like one of the maids smacking her face hard repeatedly with a book.   To be quite honest with you.. the whole atmosphere of this movie wasn't that professional. If you strip away how it visually looks and were to just view it soley on the storyline and acting, the acting was not that good apart from the woman who played the Queen and the man who played Mr. Henry who I loved.‚ù§ He was funny and though swore a few times, seemed to be the only character with any substance and anything intelligent to say. I REGRET paying to go see this DISAPPOINTING pile of crap but HE was the only one who made my money worth it. However I do not recommend you go see this movie at all. Yes its based on a true story but if you mainly wanna see fucking and less focus on the intricacies of relationships or exploration of why the Queen acts the way she does, dont waste your money on this shit. Dont make it bigger than what it deserves.   Lastly, the ending was UTTERLY AWFUL and I mean DREADFUL. I'm gonna tell it to you because you will not miss out on anything great. It basically ends with the Queen getting angry at one of the maids.. then she tells the maid to rub her leg because she suffers from gout. Then the maid just bends down.. face practically in the Queens crotch and the Queen is just staring off into space crying while the maids head is rocking back and forward which is very sexually suggestive and this unmeaningful shit goes on for 3 FUCKING minutes straight. You keep wondering what's gonna happen next. Then it ends. IT ENDS. The people in the cinema and I myself included seemed disappointed. And I personally find a  terrible ending like that is an ABSOLUTE INSULT to those who pay to go see a movie. COMPLETELY unsatisfactory ending and just terrible. The WORSE I've ever seen in a movie. Fans have tried to explain it and put a meaningful ending to it but that's simply subjective and an excuse for a bad ending which ofcourse the writer and director know people will do anyway and therefore dont give a shit about the ending. Its too late at that point anyway. Your tickets have been bought. Even if there was some sort of meaningful symbolic ending, it failed to come off.   I just SINCERELY HOPE this DOES NOT get an Oscar. I HOPE Mary Queen of Scots gets one or atleast both but I DO NOT think this is a good movie.  Visually its great. The score is great (although I  heard it was used before by the creator, kinda lazy then to use it again in a different movie) and the woman playing the Queen was great at acting and Mr. Henry was great BUT there was less focus on story.. love.. country and more on fucking. The whole movie was practically just VULGAR language and fucking which is  just not good enough. If you seen this on TV, you would think its a poor film. The director has a warped mind and you will not miss out on ANYTHING if you dont go see this movie. TRUST ME.",1,0,Playbackjunkie,SojHxpqswV8,-0.06822668650793652,2019-02-01 00:57:02,False,True

As a person who has mobility/walking difficulties/injuries, I found the scenes of crawling and just the awfulness of how the actress playing the Queen moved to be highly offensive. Offensive because they were filmed in such a way as to ridicule disabled people. I hated it. The whole movie was bothersome and I wished I hadn't watched it. No offense to Emma Stone. I thought her dialogue was basic at best and if she had better material could have done better. I've scene Jessica Chastain do far better with much less dialogue to deliver. I know the whole stop start speaking ""chop- chop hurry up now!""-- was supposed to be funny.
