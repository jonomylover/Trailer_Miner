It isn't all slapstick comedy like Family Guy/Ted/American Dad, but it was still raunchy. Gory and gross at some parts. Liam Neeson was very evil! >:] I would say it's 2/4 comedy, 1/4 love story, 1/4 evil people...This movie was NOT mainly about A Million Ways to Die in the Old West... just a small part of it was. The movie was very funny. VERY funny. Some celebrity cameos... not going to say who! :D There is a small clip after THE END shows... wait until after the credits and there is a VERY short easter egg. Well written Seth... well written. I applaud you for not making the whole movie a comedy! I loved it! :D 7.5/10 Stars I would say...
