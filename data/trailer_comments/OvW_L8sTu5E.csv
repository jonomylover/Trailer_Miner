For this live action movie remake they scrapped a couple songs from the Broadway version and added new songs that are never released before. Yes they basically have the same plot but the experience from each medium is different: new music, new actors, new effects.

We were given an interesting approach to tell a tale of Cinderella, and a stunning vision of a what the Jungle Book has to offer. Maybe this might just be a retelling of the original with just images of people in place as opposed to animation, but regardless no matter how much one loves a classic there's always flaws and there's always something missing to the story that a new vision can tell.

2016-11-14T19:32:32,i have always wanted to see the Disney's Beauty and the Beast motion picture. Especially i got obsessed with the idea after having watched King Kong in 2005 and i was just astonished by how wonderful they made King Kong in the movie. He looked pretty much real to me and i wondered why they couldnt do the same with the Beast. I didnt know about Disney was making this movie and i was quite surprised to see an ads here on youtube however my initial thought was that it was just another remake. There have been so many movies with the same name lately and none of them met my expectations. So it was just great hearing this very well known tune in the beginning of the teaser and i couldnt wait to see the Beast but when he did show up i was like damm... thats not what i expected to see at all. I will definitely go and watch this movie when its out but overall im upset with the production. Im not being an asshole its just i love this story and the Dinsey's cartoon so much that i dont want to downgrade it or get disappointed in something i've been waiting for that long.,0,0,My Own Account,OvW_L8sTu5E,0.10250000000000001,2016-11-14 19:32:32,True,True

I'm [not really very] sorry, Disney ... but you kind of lost me at Emma Watson. I think that maybe it's kind of a little bit weird. She doesn't really even look like Belle. But to each their own, I guess. Just because she's in this movie, that doesn't mean that they're could never be someone else to play the role. (I'm not alluding to whether or not that should happen. Remakes do happen, though. It's not really that big of a deal, because it's not really *personally* affecting the lives of people that get so outraged about it.) Although ... the original voice actress / live-action actress of Belle was a little bit more (well, kind of a lot more) ""spot on"". (My Boyfriend sent me the link to this trailer / video.

However, This reminds me of ""Once Upon A Time's"" Aladdin character having an English cockney accent. Why? To highlight he's a street rat? Not the right way to do it.

But then, one winter's night,  An old beggar woman came to the castle And offered him a single rose In return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance,  The Prince sneered at the gift,  And turned the old woman away. But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances,  For Beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again,  The old woman's ugliness melted away To reveal a beautiful Enchantress. The Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,  For she had seen that there was no love in his heart. And as punishment,  She transformed him into a hideous beast,  And placed a powerful spell on the castle,  And all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form,  The beast concealed himself inside his castle,  With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The Rose she had offered,  Was truly an enchanted rose,  Which would bloom for many years. If he could learn to love another,  And earn her love in return By the time the last petal fell,  Then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast For all time. As the years passed,  He fell into despair, and lost all hope,  For who could ever learn to love... A Beast?",0,0,Don'tEvenThink,OvW_L8sTu5E,0.13314285714285715,2016-11-15 03:52:48,True,True

Of the 5 remakes they have done so far (Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Maleficent, Pete's Dragon and the Jungle Book), when I saw the trailer for 4 of them I thought ""dear God they have destroyed my childhood...I hate it, I hate it, I hate it."". Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite movies period and I have extremely high expectations for this new film. This is the second trailer I have seen and I have to say, I am impressed. The casting is perfect across the board..the music is iconic. The animation looks absolutely stunning. From the trailer it looks like they are staying true to one of my favorite Disney films.

I have several complaints, I will still see it of course to give it the benefit of the doubt,  but this is what bothered me. One is Belle's accent. She doesn't need to sound French since the animated Belle didn't sound French, but for pete sake get rid of the British accent, especially when the rest of the cast doesn't sound British it just throws it off. If Benedict Cumberbatch could ditch his British accent in Dr. Strange then she could to. Just takes a bit of practice is all. Two, the animation looks alright until you get to Chip and Mrs.Teapot. It doesn't look right, I can't put my finger on it as to why it just looks weird to me. Three, the dress is too lackluster compared to what it was in the film. It looks like a prom dress. They did excellent on Cinderella's dress in the live action remake, but if you look up why the dress isn't even corseted it's because Emma didn't want to feel constricted wearing the dress. Then she makes up some stuff saying that Belle is a tomboy and wouldn't even wear a dress like she did in the movie. What about her screams tomboy? She reads and is different than everyone else that does not equal tomboy in my opinion. That was just an excuse because you didn't want to go all out on a extravagant dress because it might be ''uncomfortable.' Welcome to the acting world hunny! If Lilly James danced and ran in a corseted dress I'm sure there was a way you could make it work.",1,0,loverkitty,OvW_L8sTu5E,0.1425865800865801,2016-11-15 15:30:55,True,True

Other words all you need to know that makes us as movie goers when it comes to remakes is how is this thing going to be shot and how is the acting going to be in this one versus the last one, because maybe the acting wasn't all that great, or they didn't pull us in enough to buy into the story, or what if you didn't cry in the last one like they intended but in this reboot they might do just that in the end, or just maybe the cinematography was so poorly done in the last one that with this new director, he/she might finally get the angles of the camera shots just right for the first time. I know we shouldn't have to think this way but that's all it is when these guys decide to remake and reboot movies. They expect us to go see it based on the new setup approach, new ideas to add to the story, direction and acting, not because of the movie... although it is part of it but it's only a small part of the reason why we would even consider watching the trailer and of course because of curiosity.

Did they team up with the wicked fairy and set him up for his fall? +1  5. 0:19 Not even during a full moon in an artificial light-free area is the night ever this well lit. +1  6. 0:29 Oh, Emma Watson is in this movie! I guess that means women now have equal rights and that feminism is dead, right? +1  7. 0:33 - 0:36 You're in the wrong movie, papa.

2016-11-16T19:17:20,"True Religion Which is the True Religion?   Introduction  Each person is born in a circumstance which is not of his own choosing.  The religion of his family or the ideology of the state is thrust upon him from the very beginning of his existence in this world.  By the time he reaches his teens, he is usually fully brain-washed into believing that the beliefs of his particular society are the true religion and that everyone should have.  However, when some people are exposed to other religions, they begin to question the validity of their own.  The seekers of true religion often reach a point of confusion upon realizing that each and every religion, sect, and ideology claims to be the one and only correct way for men and women.  Indeed, they all encourage people to do good.  So, which one is right?  They cannot all be right, since each claims all others are wrong.  Then how does the seeker of truth choose the right path?  We will answer that after talking a bit about its importance.  Is it worth it to search for the true religion?  Absolutely, it is, because in most main religions, this present life is only a test for the next realm of existence.  In other words, our place in the hereafter, either Heaven (Paradise) or Hell, is decided by which religion we follow.  Moreover, the life in the hereafter is eternal, unlike the present life, which usually does not exceed 100 years.  The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, said: ‚ÄúWhoever enters Paradise is blessed with a life of joy; he will never feel miserable, his clothes will never wear out, and his youth shall never fade away. The people will hear a divine call: ‚ÄòI grant you that you will be healthy and never fall sick, you will live and never die, you will be young and never age, you will be joyful and never feel miserable.‚Äô‚Äù (Narrated in Saheeh Muslim).  And God has said in the Holy Quran: ‚ÄúTruly, God will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds, to Gardens underneath which rivers flow (in Paradise), wherein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments therein will be of silk.‚Äù (Quran, 22:23)  Also the Prophet said that the lowest in rank among the dwellers of Paradise (Heaven) will have ten times the like of this world, and he or she will have whatever he or she desires and ten times like it.  And that they will live a very happy life without sickness, pain, sadness, or death; God will be pleased with them; and they will live there forever.  So after this, how can a wise person risk loosing all these pleasures?!  Usually in this world, we spend several years to get a certificate that entitle us for a good job.  So doesn‚Äôt our eternal life deserves that we spend for it few weeks or days of reading and studying to decide which religion is acceptable beside God and which will lead us to eternal happiness?   Which one is the true religion?  Now comes the big question, which is the true religion of God?  God gave us all minds and intellects to enable us to make this crucial decision.  It is the most important decision in the life of a human being.  Upon it depends his/her future.  Consequently, each and every one of us must examine dispassionately the evidence presented, and choose what appears to be right until further evidence arises.  Below are some suggested steps for finding that:  1.    First, to save time, omit those religions that don‚Äôt claim to be from God, and those religions that are not widespread, because usually the truth of a right religion is so apparent that many would follow it.  Also omit those religions that don't accept converts to it.  2.    From the above step we will get very few religions left.  Read online and from books about the proofs, arguments, beliefs, and practices of these religions.  3.    During this, keep asking God sincerely to show you and open your heart for the true religion and to assist you in following it when you find it.  Sometimes we know what is the right path but don't have the courage and will to go ahead with it.  4.    After this study, mostly one of these religions should stand out, and you will find that one of them is more logic, authentic, and in accordance with your mind and heart.  5.    Put your heritage, prejudgments, emotions, and fear aside and follow that religion for within it lies our happiness in this life and in the hereafter.  6.    Now let us begin the journey of finding the truth.  For Islam, below are some recommended online resources.  Try to read them in the same order.  They are brief and can be read in few hours.  For the remaining religions, you may search online or at your local library.",0,2,Dr.Mohd waheed,OvW_L8sTu5E,0.15394133644133648,2016-11-16 19:17:20,True,True

Like, you can tell that they tried to make it look like the animated version, but they also tried to make it more human looking. Which just made it stupid looking. Then again, I guess the animated version would've been literal hell to try and recreate in CG, and it wouldn't have been nearly as expressive as the hand drawn version. I guess I'm glad they didn't keep him in the shadows. I'd have been disappointed when I went to actually see the movie.  As for the side characters, they all look ok to me except for Chip. Putting the handle in the middle of his 'face' is cute enough in the animated version, but here it looks...odd.

Beauty and the Beast is traditionally a story about an extraordinary woman who falls for the beast, though she could do much better, only because he's imprisoning her. Not much feminism here, and a bit stockholm syndrom-ish. I'm not sure if Emma can pull off a more inspiring story out of this (unless the movie ends with ""I like you too, but come on, you imprisoned me"").

The original BATB took its time from scene to scene, engrossing one in its characters. 2. The trailer reveals  practically the whole movie, including the Beast. What is really left to the imagination? 3.The scenes of the town look downright broadway-ish, not cinematic. 4. Gaston is miscast: Luke Evans has none of the imposing musculature, chin, blue eyes, or booming voice of the original. I reserve judgment for Emma Watson. 5. Ewan McGregor... rich French accent? I missed it. 6. Most concerning of all, if one never watched the original movie, this trailer would make zero storytelling sense. The trailer obviously pans to the original's audience, but that's precisely the danger: all pandering at the expense of poor  storytelling (story is completely absent in the trailer, which may prove telling). 7.

She acts more like a beast than a princess and that is because she is a feminist, modern woman ( and probably thats why they cast her) i got it...But the character Belle is not like that, she is nice and sweet, with advanturous spirit but in the same time really sensitive person, really curious and a little bit naive.

They were the Nazis, they were the  ones who killed the French royal family, they were the ones who  murdered millions and millions of Christians - the pictures of people in  concentration camps ARE CHRISTIANS they gassed!! wsake up - they used  the money they stole during the frnech and russian revolutions to then  infiltrate Americana nd the west and fool us into thinking that they  were righteous members of our community and they are NOT - they HATE us  and want us all DEAD, they mock us in their movies and in their Games -  Assassins Creed is designed to convince you that the Assassins are the  good ones and the Masons are the bad ones - and they claim they are  giving you free will - only God gives free will - they actually took  away your free will - the Assassins are the bad ones, they assassinated  the royal families of europe and stole their mponey and land and titles  and set up parliaments to fool you to think you are free, but ONLY JEWS  run for parliament and they use tactics to stop normal members of the  ocmmunity getting able to run!! or they assassinate them! Wake up - the  Assassins creed and all the movies and books they use to convince you  Christians are bad and they are Great - but it is all lies - they are  Murderers, Cut-throats and Theives, nothing more and nothing less -  Marie Antoinette's mother said 'Do not let the Jews have control of the  money, for they are cunning and manipulative and not in anyway  charitable - YOU HAD FREE EDUCATION UNDER THE CHRISTIANS and TAXES were  only 10% - under the JEWS you are paying 70% in taxes (i.e. 30% GST, yes  the farmer pays, the trucking company pays and then you pay = 30%, 10%  superannuation, and 30% income tax = 70%!!) and they are slowly  stripping away your right and your money - they already stole the Gold  in your reserves, they use large programs like NBN network to funnel  money out of the country and not actually do the work (i.e. you already  have broadband network cables laid - NBN is Fraud!!) and the IMF is  simply fleecing you by scaring you that you need to fund Infrastructure  to create Jobs - but then they place you in huge Debt and the dollar  drops so your economy falls and you LOOSE jobs - they will always lie  and dont belive a word they say - just thin of the opposite to what they  say, and then you have the TRUTH!! Wake up, turn your money into Gold  and wear White Clothes, and a wooden cross around your neck, they wear  Black and HATE christians, so you will be able to tell who they are,  they will give themselves away and the Gold is so when they crash the  economy you all will survive and be able to restart the economy through a  barter system - exchanging goods and services between each other and or  using gold as payment...collect seeds from vegetables and plants that  can reproduce - not Monsantos, they deliberately created plants that do  not reporduce so we wont survive - and DO NOT GO DOWN INTO THE BUNKERS  they plan to GAS YOU!! warn everyone, we are already fighting back,  (I.e. Jo Cox the UK politician was one of them) arm yourselves, be  prepared - do not end up like the French who millions are buried in the  catacombs of paris, do not end up like the russians, who they shipped  off to Siberia and slaughtered them in mass graves, do not end up like  the germans and europeans, who they shot in the head and buried in mass  graves and gassed in Conceptration Camps (THEY WERE CHRISTIANS Murdered  by JEWISH!!!)

2016-11-21T06:51:45,"Aided by Chip, Maurice and Belle escape from confinement. While the villagers are fended off by the servants, Gaston fights the Beast. The Beast initially is too depressed to fight back, but perks up after seeing Belle return to the castle. He corners Gaston and spares his life, but orders him to leave. Gaston mortally wounds the Beast, but loses his footing and falls to his death.[a] Belle professes her love for the Beast, who dies before the last rose petal falls. With the spell broken, the Beast revives and returns to his true form. The servants resume their human forms and the castle is restored to its former glory. Belle dances with Adam in the ballroom as everyone watches in delight.  Whoops, i think i spoiled it",0,0,Andre Legg,OvW_L8sTu5E,0.075,2016-11-21 06:51:45,True,True

Look wise, sure there would have been some actresses who would've fit the role a bit better (Jessica Brown Findlay comes to mind) but why do people say Emma Watson can't act?! As for the beast, I agree, they could have made him look more beastly and less ""cute"". But then I suppose Disney is still quite concerned if the character will still be ""pretty enough"" to make the audience fall in love with him. Even in the original film - in which the Beast was just broader and hairier not much difference aside from that - the creature still looked kind of ""cuddly"" if you know what I mean. I mean honestly the film would not have been as successful if the Beast had been truly hideous.  Aside from all that I believe credit is due as well.

2016-11-29T10:17:03,"I enjoy some of Emma Watson's films (and have grown up with her since Harry Potter. I'm also proud of the actress she has become to, because as a young actor/actress to come out into the starlight so young and so hardcore as she did, she truly held it together nicely and classy), but ...BUT, I truly would not of pictured her for the role of Belle :-o .....I do pray she can pull it off, as in my opinion it will take alot of effort on her part. It's just, to me, she looks nothing like Belle (though she is absolutely beautiful). Even if she pulls it off amazingly, I, again, just am thrown they chose her. And, I am not excluding her partner Dan Stevens, I'll be honest, I am not familiar with him off the top of my head but, I would of expected a bit more beefy of a man for the roll (if there is such a term lol) of the Beast. So far, the trailer looks quite amazing. Bringing back some really happy memories (though Emma Thompsonplays Angela Lansbury's role, Lansbury is one of my top 3 ladies and truth be told I am saddened that she is not back for the role, Thompson is a great 2nd). And come on Iam McKellen for Cogsworth, now that was great thinking!!! Now the only one I am sooo not thrilled to be reminded of for obvious reasons, and for the simple truth as to why my expectations were sooooooo much higher for the man I marry, is Gaston #ugh , the cartoon one made me gag and still the very thought does. BUT BUT I am soo mad at the new actor, Luke Evans, SERIOUSLY, Directors, you just had to put one of the worlds MOST hottest actor for Gaston :-/ YOU'RE SO MAKING MY MIND FLIP FLOP!!! LOL!!!! Well anyway, I am just happy my fav classic cartoons are coming out in real life versions! SOOO happy!!! xoxoxox can't wait! Shout out to actors Stanley Tucci, Ewan McGregor, Kevin Kline and last but not least Gugu Mbatha-Raw (seriously great choice, any role she has small or big, I enjoy every film she does!) ok, I am finished venting (why we treat social media sometimes as our personal journals, is still beyond me lol)!!!",27,7,AJ A,OvW_L8sTu5E,0.288504789481352,2016-11-29 10:17:03,True,True

2016-12-03T06:50:48,"You know, I had a hunch that maybe Emma wasn't the wisest choice for the role of Belle, and seeing people's feedback is confirming it to me.  The word acting says so itself, to convince the audience the role the actor/actress has taken is being perceived the way it's supposed to be, but in every single B&TB trailer I got to people are not seeing Belle, they are seeing... Hermione. And that's a big, big problem.  I am aware that playing the very same role for so many years has made her Emma's signature role and that she's considered a good role model IRL, but even under such strong labels, we should be capable to toss the Emma/Hermione shell aside to perceive Belle instead, but apparently that's not what's happening, and I hope once we get to see the full movie, my biggest disappointment does not come true, which I'm already trying to keep at bay since the prom dress is hinting at it and with it comes this horrid habit hollywood is attempting to do nowadays, which simply BUTCHERS the essence of the prime character and casts them out of the universe they're set in. I will not blame Emma for the poor choices the directing crew may have done, but I know it needs two to tango, and I did hear Emma tried to rewrite Belle in some aspects so she could look ""more intelligent"", like having *her* be the inventor instead of her father (something I also do not take for wise because her father IS a likeable character and I'd hate to see him turned to a plot device).

2016-12-06T07:24:36,"An enchantress, disguised as an old beggar, offers an enchanted rose to a young prince in exchange for shelter in his castle from the cold, but he refuses. For his arrogance, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and inflicts a spell on the castle. She gives him a magic mirror that enables him to view faraway events, along with the rose. To break the spell, the prince must learn to love another and earn her love in return before the rose's last petal falls on his 21st birthday. If he fails, he will remain a beast forever.  Ten years later, a young bookworm girl named Belle is bored of her village life and seeks excitement. Because of her nonconformist ideals, she is ridiculed by everyone except her father Maurice (an odd inventor), the town bookseller, and a vain muscular hunter named Gaston. Despite being popular with the townsfolk, Gaston is determined to marry Belle but she repeatedly rejects his advances.  Maurice and his horse Phillipe get lost in the forest while traveling to a fair to present his newest invention, a wood-chopping machine. After being chased by a pack of wolves, he comes across the Beast's castle. Inside, he meets Lumi√®re the candlestick, Cogsworth the clock, Mrs. Potts the teapot, and her son Chip the teacup. However, the Beast quickly discovers and captures Maurice. After Phillipe leads Belle to the Beast's castle, she offers to take her father's place. Over her father's objection, the Beast accepts Belle's offer. While Gaston sulks over Belle's rejection, Maurice returns to town but is unable to convince the others to rescue Belle.  The Beast sulks in his room when Belle refused to have dinner with him that night. Despite this, Lumi√®re offers her a meal. While he and Cogsworth also give her a tour of the castle, she wanders into the forbidden West Wing. When the Beast inadvertently chases her into the forest by frightening her, Belle encounters the wolves. The Beast rescues Belle but he gets injured in the process. He begins to develop feelings for her while she nurses his wounds and he delights her by showing his extensive library. While the two begin to bond in the Beast's castle, in the village Gaston pays Monsieur D'Arque to send Maurice to the town's insane asylum if Belle refuses Gaston's proposal again.  Sharing a romantic evening dance together, Belle tells the Beast she misses her father. He lets her use his magic mirror to see him. She sees Maurice dying in the woods trying to reach the castle. The Beast lets her go out to save him and he gives her the mirror to remember him by. Accompanied by Chip, Belle finds Maurice and brings him home. As Gaston is about to forcibly bring Maurice to the insane asylum, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by showing the Beast with the magic mirror. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, Gaston convinces the villagers that the Beast is a man-eating monster and leads them to the castle to kill him.  Aided by Chip, Maurice and Belle escape from confinement. While the villagers are fended off by the servants, Gaston fights the Beast. The Beast initially is too depressed to fight back, but perks up after seeing Belle return to the castle. He corners Gaston and spares his life then orders him to leave. Gaston mortally wounds the Beast, but loses his footing and falls to his death.[a] Belle professes her love for the Beast, who dies before the last rose petal falls. With the spell broken, the Beast reverts to his true form alive. The servants resume their human forms and the castle is restored to its former glory. Belle dances with the prince in the ballroom as everyone watches in delight.",1,1,ann,OvW_L8sTu5E,0.07592592592592594,2016-12-06 07:24:36,True,True

Everything is beautifully done for sure, there's a great cast and obviously a lot of effort put into tiny nuances and detail, and as a fan of the original story I love that there will be a new version of it, but the problem I have is that they are showing too much of what the characters look like BEFORE the film is released. For me,  this is something that takes away some of the audiences' surprise for this version I feel, which is kind of a bloody shame. :/ Since they are following largely the original Disney version and not the original book, we already know most of the character's personalities and how we either enjoy or loathe them. Having the surprise of what they look like taken away probably is something I think should have been avoided to keep the audience interested in how the final version would be. I think a lot of movie fans have been noticing this in other movies and movie genres as well, but I haven't really seen a lot of people confirm this or not. Thoughts? :)",0,0,Cat Hope,OvW_L8sTu5E,0.28389191453707585,2016-12-25 00:13:44,True,True

So Belle knows she can revert the spell? and perhaps fall in love not with the Beast but with the possibility of he becoming human again? WHY DID THEY DO THIS!? WHY REMOVE THE COMPASSION AND THE TRUE LOVE APPROACH FROM THE MOVIE!?!  The discussion of Belle and Beast at the rose scene (when she tries to touch it) could have been way better conducted, that pause when Beast looks at his hands and imagines that he could be stuck like that forever is awesome in the animated movie! The pause he makes when imagining it, the way he speaks, growing in anger and then addressing Belle is geniously done in the animated movie!

I'm sorry. I really, really love. But ok. I have to say that to me she is largely overrated. She did not have the strength and the delicacy, the courage and the sweetness of the character of Belle, her intelligence, her rebellious spirit, her force as a woman who loves.¬† Ok... The director said ""I don't want the princess, I want the woman, it's not a tale, it's a story"". BAH! Walking with a book and¬† Watching the library with big eyes it's not enough to say that Belle is emancipated and a free and innovative spirit...i know that this actress is a kind of symbol, she is and she is represented as the actress who wants to emancipate girls with herself and what she does, trough her art... But I really think she needs to develop better her talent from the Hermione character... What I saw today is a Hermione, with a lower profile, in a yellow dress. No character's magic, no development, no intelligence, no mistery... Nothing... Only the same one expression... ¬†This film is overrated. Ok, the special effects were WOW, but the only one character who really works maybe it's Gaston (but not so much...).  What about the ""plus"" that the real film had to bring to this story? I see thousands of steps back. I found ridiculous that the great story, the magic, the real life, the poetry, the sense of a bright future... the real sense of this story, the angst and the courage, the sadness and the happiness, the great characters, their personalities and spirits work better IN A CARTOON than I a film with REAL PEOPLE.

This adaptation is better than the original, in my opinion, and the animation is my favourite film of all time, so it is hard for me to admit it. Emma didn't just fit in the role, she was Belle. Her attitude, her face, her expresion, it's like the producer was waiting for her to be born and make the best remake after one of the best animation ever. My favourite scene? Well, my all time favourite scene from this movie has always been the part when Beast dies. I used to watch that moment a hundred of times, when i was a kid. But the most surprisingly part was when Belle had her first dinner in the Castle. That was just unbelievable. I was shocked. There were no mistakes, but the alluring part was how perfect, how magic and real in the same time all of that looked. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was the best scene from this movie for sure.

Plain-looking, low socio-economic status girl somehow meets a prince through improbable circumstances, who of course instantly falls in love with her and marries her and shares his wealth and vast estate with her forever after. And naturally not only is he a wealthy prince, but handsome as a runway model. A dangerous fantasy to feed into the heads of little girls and teenagers.

What dare my interest was what I saw in Cinderella 2016 movie, the scripting, storyline, directing, props and detailing etc are just too good, the elaboration completes the movie just fine and nothing exaggerated dramatic or action hero wannabe kind of movie. I anticipated same performance in Beauty and The Beast, was not disappointed at all, those two films are just good as one another! Only I was looking forward to a cast with more soft and sweet side, as well youthful to play Belle, Emma Watson is more of this smarty tough look, maturedly, and we've seen her everywhere, there's no feel of original Belle especially she is prominent as Hermione. If they prefer a highly familiar face, would rather see Kirsten Stewart here esp Kirsten and Emma look kinda alike... imagine Bella becomes Belle. Does singing really matter, if it is that bad they can always mime someone else's singing unless your character is a singer itself, right? The Cinderella girl was perfect and that movie had only slight musical scene. No situation express through singing goes draggy for a not so a musical fan,  left more space on the story telling compared to Beauty and The Beast, still, they both are just as good. 5 stars.",1,1,Sally Lemon,OvW_L8sTu5E,0.20849974398361495,2017-04-20 17:49:14,False,True
