2017-07-19T22:50:02,Hi There! I have lost my home in fire in antioch Ca on july 7 2017... Thankfully all of us were able to escape and no one was injured. But almost all of our belongings are gone and we dont have a place to put the rest what we were able to save that day.  Even after trying hard we are yet not able to find a place for us to live.I have two kids of 5 and 2 years old. My husband do part time job. Rentals are either too expensive for us to afford or not available at all.  It is so frustrating to live as guest while our leftover stuff is decaying outside.  One of our friend set an account for us on gofundme to raise some money to help us find a place to live.... If you feel like to help us please go on the link given below and donate according to your will. Thank You God bless you. https://www.gofundme.com/k33ndwss,0,0,Wow Unbeliveable,XFYWazblaUA,-0.024449035812672184,2017-07-19 22:50:02,True,True

2017-07-19T23:04:14,"For all who are reading this and are deeply disappointed, having financial difficulties and have either given up on all or most politicians or have lost your faith in the American System, this message is for you:  We are in no doubt living in difficult, trying and troubling times.  We live in a world where Greed and self love has taken over thus causing little justice for those who are really trying hard just to make it or are forced to live above their actual means.  It's everywhere! The hearts of many have turned cold and the decent every day person is finding it harder and harder to just stay afloat and take care of your family.  Don't lose faith- God sees you right where you are and contrary to a new Popular thought- He both loves and cares about each of you and always will.  There is still good in this world. There are still decent human beings who genuinely care about you, your family and your needs.  God Bless each of you and may God sustain you as you continue to work for your family in your own little corner of the world.  God is for us, Who can be against us? I pray for you to be at peace wherever you are even though we are surrounded by uncertainties, chaos and disappointments.  God will sustain you through it all just as He sustains me.

Instead, another role where our language is used to make a character ""different"" is given to a hearing performer who probably didn't know the first thing about ASL prior to taking on this role. ASL isn't a thing you can learn to use realistically in the time it takes to film a movie. While the film looks great and I love Guillermo del Toro's body of work, I can't help but be disappointed by the persistent avoidance of Deaf talent. I'm not saying the movie's going to be bad, but I'm significantly less excited about it now than I was initially.

2017-12-04T03:52:58,"One more step towards normalising bestiality.. But they do it slowly, so most people are probably ok with this at this point..  Remember the nephilim, in times of mythology? We are seeing a repeat and don't realise it because that's 'just myth'.  There are other beings in the spiritual realm. They speak to people through inspirations and subconscious suggestions. We're working towards releasing them into our world. What do you think all these movies, games and commercials about hybrid humans, portals, and breaking down walls are about? The all-seeing eye that people connect purely to the Illuminati, too. It represents the pineal gland, the spiritual gateway.  But there's more to it than that. The male/female signs that - decades later - now combine to make the trans symbol; the same symbol is 'coincidentally' the symbol of Orion/Saturn/Satan. If you've ever seen the Baphomet image, you will probably recall that it's part human, part goat, part male, part female.  If you want to say that these things are in the past, you should realise that the past isn't another reality. The past has journeyed into the present, and the same things exist. Things that we're now seeing reborn in the time of the scrying mirror in every home (television - think crystal ball or palantir. If you don't believe that, you only have to look at the first televisor, whose logo was the planet Saturn, AKA Orion. On the planet is a single open eye. The viewer can see places on the other side of the world, and glimpse into the past. It is a modern crystal ball, used to send _spiritual_ images to everyone, under the guise of entertainment).  Mock me if you want. It doesn't make any difference to me, I say this as a warning for your sakes.  I know there are all kinds of strange people saying all kinds of strange things, but that's what it is. You can easily confirm it for yourself by researching what I have said, but I'm not some nut who watched a conspiracy theory video (as credible as that is, from someone who could very well be a nutcase and not realise it) - I have studied these things for a decade, seen individual aspects for myself, and been able to piece most of it together. It's a factual part of everyday life for me, like waking up to drink coffee and seeing birds out my window - I see all of this just as plainly and undeniably. If you think about it, you will realise for yourself.  But there is also a way out of what's coming, by praying for forgiveness, turning to God and following Jesus, so that we will know to steer clear of the traps that everyone else will fall into, and not be fooled by the false Christ that will lead many to death while telling them that they're going into ascension and immortality.",0,1,Jack Lewis,XFYWazblaUA,0.06919879062736205,2017-12-04 03:52:58,False,True

Everyone saw her differently, and it made her feel almost inhuman. Therefore they literally put something inhuman into her life, and by doing that it is depicted that in a sense only two of the same kind or the same conditions as one another can see each other as they are. This is because the ""sea monster"" is seen differently too, and that is the whole reason they form a bond- because they as individuals see nothing wrong with each other.

The villain was so over the top and predictable and his 5-star general boss' character is cringe-worthy. The overall tone of the movie was so embarrassingly and overtly sentimental but done in a very cheesy and over the top fashion. I found all the inconsistencies to be extremely distracting too! I don't understand how Eliza, the main character, was able to sneak in the first few times and fed the merman eggs without getting caught when there were cameras in that room from day one but only in the end when she tries to rescue the merman did the cameras became important to her. When the merman escapes while her best friend/neighbor falls asleep it ends up in a movie theater all by itself watching a movie and leaving bloody hand prints all over for Eliza to find but no a single other soul saw the merman running around, the cashier at the movie must have been asleep when the merman came through the door. The good scientist, Dmitri, played by Michael Stuhlbarg, was a cheesy character and the whole Russian mafia side plot was very boring and ineffective and didn't add to the movie at all. Stuhlbarg was so brilliant in Call Me By Your Name as the father that it was disappointing to see him in his very cheesy role. For me Shape of Water was not even close to being one of the best of the year.

2018-02-04T17:46:49,"For those that are interested ....  WARNING: SOME SPOILERS .... read this AFTER viewing the film, if interested.  The Shape of Water is not a (traditional) story; it is a tale, a fairy tale to be more precise. GDT has said so, and it is what he says it is. I have noted that he has refrained for the past couple of months from over-playing this difference, possibly at the behest of the studio (Fox Searchlight) maybe out of the studio's fear of impact to ticket sales and Oscar awards -- a ""monster / creature"" is enough for some people to have to ""deal with"", never mind adding on ""fairy tale"". Many people (and not just film goers) are consumed with almost exclusive interest in real life stories. A story is focused on real people or people that are to be considered real. A tale is more abstract and fictional, with almost always one or more characters that humankind is not known to have encountered (e.g., The Little Red Riding Hood's talking wolf).   GDT even beautifully frames the fairy tale for the film audience, having a voice that appears to be the Giles character narrate an opening and an ending -- the voice is telling a tale, which GDT then presents as film for 99% of the tale. The voice is the teller of the fairy tale, and the teller sees himself very much in one of the characters (Giles) of the tale -- the narrator may not actually be the Giles character, even though the voice is the same. Note: GDT also cleverly  uses the short opening narration to reinforce the expected audience's natural predilection to consider a living creature that is not human as ""a monster"", as opposed to a (deranged?) human that physically does not appear as such on initial encounter.  The ending has the same voice (tale teller) return to wrap the fairy tale and provide (some) closure to the audience with the meaning of ""the shape of water"", while leaving intended ambiguity on what transpires for Eliza -- the audience can enjoy the ending it likes/wants/considers appropriate. Ergo, GDT's modern fairy tale (? I dunno; maybe). You will note that the actual character Giles ""narrates"" (i.e., speaks to us, the audience) at one (and only one) instance in the film .... and it is right in the middle, it is rather short and wholly natural, .... and it is the absolute climax of the film, and the thesis of the fairy tale --- when Eliza demands that Giles speak back to her in vocal words (""narrates"") what she is telling him about what she has found for herself with her interactions with the river god creature -- what it is meaning to her; how it is rescuing her from her struggles as an ""other"" (someone not neatly like most people, as a mute, and with neck scars). GDT does not use subtitles here for Eliza's signing, but instead critically lays out the central thesis of the fairy tale with the protagonist (Eliza) emotionally relating it to another character that GDT has unambiguously pass on to the audience (those very many of us that do not sign), by saying back to her what she is saying, what she needs him (and GDT wants the audience) to know and understand about what she is experiencing with the river god creature. In fact , the whole repetition (signing plus voice relate back) in the delivery serves to reinforce the central thesis as message.  Beyond all that, the wide genius of the fairy tale in film form, and what makes it a relevant tale for us, is the rather timely touchstones of societal struggles of actual humankind, those that are 'other', that existed not only in the tale's human/earth/America time setting (1962), but exist (still) today (no matter what some of us might consider as 'improvements' in the 55 years since).  Once you wrap in the rest of the film's components: the excellent acting performances of the 5 central characters (I thought Michael Shannon was brilliant as the (real, human) monster), the set production, the score, the homage to films (intended to ground the fairy tale, because these historical films are not fairy tale; the shown film excerpts are known to be real), the multitude of allegories (from shoes, to color, to presences of water, to fingers (signing and lost), the beautiful filming (full of moving camera shots), the art of the costume that was the river god creature (3 years to complete), and the ultra smooth directing and editing, with the acts of the film leading comfortably one to the next, and you get the wonderful cinematic masterpiece that in all likelihood will have Academy voters preferring it, in general consensus, over all the other nominated films for Best Picture.",88,8,Innis Mor,XFYWazblaUA,0.18091948621553888,2018-02-04 17:46:49,False,True

Don't get me wrong , he has made some very good films but sadly , in my opinion , The Shape of Water is definitely not one of them. In the hidden high security government laboratory where she works, lonely Elisa is trapped in a life of isolation. Elisa’s life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda discover a secret classified experiment on a water based man like creature. Elisa finds she is falling in love with a creature that others want dead.  I really do not know what all the fuss was about with this film. Sure , Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon are good but they usually always are. This had the feel of an average story that you might have seen on an episode of The Twilight Zone . For a Del Toro film the special affects were very average , almost like a B movie from back in the day. Perhaps that was what he was trying to achieve ?

2018-03-05T09:15:35,"Before you judge, or think, read the whole comment first, for your own good. It’s not about Love or finding something that comforts you. As people we can’t just believe everything that this movie is telling us. We must love each other and care because it is our duty to do so. Without religion, morals and ethics are made up, but that doesn’t mean we can just make random justifications if religion is not true. Regardless of religion, if a creature like this were real, we can’t go out of our way to save it because our emotions tell us to. Some who regard religion might say “how would you feel if you were killed and tested on”. I would say “well without religion my future is set, and killing it and testing it would not affect my future. And still if a creature looks, moves, has emotions like us it is still not us. If we want to test on it then we will be following the laws of the food chain. If you are regarding religion then we are just animals doing what we can to stay on top. Right, torturing it was wrong, but preventing scientific achievements is just as wrong too if you regard religion. And if we include religion then, that means the creature is not like us and we can kill it peacefully to advance as a human race. It healed the old man it gave his hair back. And that is something that god definitely permits, which is to explore medicine. We can kill plants with medicine but not a fish man. Plants are alive but just because an organism feels emotion it makes it different, now that is wrong. Hmmmm. Religion and not religion, these characters( the old man and the two main female characters) were wrong. We can’t be delusional and deceived by our own comforts. If we find a creature like this one day, no one should ever be like these main characters. We are more, we are no where near nothingness, the director of this movie is giving us a easy way out. What happened to the longer way, where we try to heal people and make them believe and know they are special and equal? We can’t just lower ourselves and love something just because it gave a feeling of love. Love has no shape because it can’t be defined or pointed out. But in fact it can. Love is also doing what’s right and making change, for each other. Not saving a fish man for yourself. Or even if you just wanted it to live, you regarded all the lives that this creature could have saved. In reality you would report that it was tortured, and make some type of movement. I’m not angry or upset, I just know that some people might be directed towards the wrong way of thinking and of solving things in life. Religion or no religion I believe Everything I have typed is true. I just may have left something out that would make you disagree with me. If you believe that a creature like this is like us and no different, and you believe in religion or not, then I don’t know what to tell you. All I can say to you is that love it have sex with it, but do not interfere with the people who had it first and want to “kill” it for scientific discovery. Because like you loving it, they are doing what they find comforting. Right? If you believe that it is like us then it really doesn’t matter if we kill it. It is only about who is doing what they want. Or if you also think it should be free if it wants to, then we go back to the food chain, we all do what we need to survive. It escapes and let all the kind hearted people who need help die, or it dies. After all if it is like us, then basically it is either a human dies for survival ...or a human dies for survival. Same scenario. All points proven wrong. Now prove me wrong, if you can.",1,0,BeatsV123,XFYWazblaUA,0.11892024642024641,2018-03-05 09:15:35,False,False

But I haven't watched it, so i cannot say for sure). You mustn't go, expecting a movie like the Marvel films or alike, since that will taint the experience. Go in with the mindset of watching Pan's Labyrinth. Accept what you see, and don't ask too many questions. It's gonna get weird. Real weird.

2018-03-05T22:52:06,"It's sad that people think this is a great movie. It's so labored and contrived. Why has the fish man been captured? Because cutting him up will somehow help us in the space race. Um, what? Why? How? Then there's Elisa's plan to break the fish man out of prison. Let's talk about this silly super secret research lab. Very important research going on there. VERY important. The fish man is a highly valuable asset. Does anyone guard the lab, inside or out? Nope. Elisa can come and go at will. The next bit of silliness is that Elisa has no idea how she's going to free the fish man from his shackles. So it's super convenient that the undercover Russian spy chooses this moment to reveal himself and free the fish man. What luck! There's a term for this kind of silliness: deus ex machina. It's what you fall back on when you're not interested in creating a believable story. There's no other reason for the Russian scientist to exist except to free the fish man. He's pure contrivance. Now for my last complaint, which is a doozy. Elisa wants to return the fish man to the ocean. So naturally the plans to release him into a canal that won't open to the ocean for a some time. Well great, because that will give her a chance to have sex with her prisoner. What? He's not her prisoner? Then why is she keeping him in her bathroom longer than necessary? Baltimore sits on the scouts a canal that won't open to the ocean until a certain date, so that's when she plans to free the fish man. But why does she have to release him into the canal? Why not just take him to the Patapsco River? It's right there!",0,0,Andulamb,XFYWazblaUA,0.13205532212885157,2018-03-05 22:52:06,False,False

It is beautifully well done and the story is amazing, the actors are amazing and the direction is amazing and so are the visuals. This movie is directed by Guillermo Del Toro and I would say it’s his best work yet. I have not seen to many of his movies but what I've seen this is the best one in my opinion. Great movie. I wanted to see this cause I thought it was a new version of the creature from the black lagoon I was not expecting what I got and what I got was gold. I don’t know why this movie is getting 3 and a half stars on amazon. All in all I was very pleased with this film, I went in the theater not knowing what to expect and left happy.

2018-03-16T05:04:50,"The Shape of Water is like a Rorschach test.  1. Romantics see it as a unique love story that also is an ode to 30’s-60’s cinema in style and filming technique   2.  Literary and visual arts folks see a cornucopia of symbolism and color analysis that will keep film students busy for a couple of generations  3. Fans of del Toro's talent see a master director who can create and then tell a strangely bizarre story while bringing very talented actors and crew to even greater heights than anyone thought possible 4. Political junkies (and I am a white/hetero male on the center-right) see it as a call for a more civil discussion both politically and socially.  5. Those who come straight from alt-right and illuminati sites call it a ""beastiality"" film - but won’t likely see how (*spoilers) two central characters are a male sentient god-like 'creature' and a female who actually is a 'fish out of water- and might lose sight of this as fantasy fiction.   6. Those who find it boring may prefer Transformers or other CGI-heavy flicks 7. Dudes and gals who grew up loving classic and B movie horror see an homage to creature feature films 8.  Movie producers see a profitable film with a budget of under $20mil, with production value that appears to exceed $130mil - which is its worldwide ticket sales to date 9.  As someone who saw about 4 dozen films in 2017, and have been predicting Oscar winners for years, I see this best pic of 2018 as arguably the best of the Oscar BP winners over the past five years",281,7,rhythmoriented,XFYWazblaUA,0.18555555555555556,2018-03-16 05:04:50,False,False

That this movie won Best Picture - as well as Best Director and others - bodes well for others taking more chances. If I had any criticisms, it was that del Toro attempts to jam too much into this movie, with examinations of homophobia, racism, loneliness, and aging, to name a few!

Having lived thru the time era it is set in - it is unrealistic - the manners of today have been superimposed into a time long before and very different. The language today in public is much more filthy than it was back then. Having those characters speak with today's language is out of place.

2018-03-23T22:24:56,"I really enjoyed this movie I agree it was a beautiful movie but one big problem about the relationship of Elsie and Asset. Now i see nothing wrong with outside human race/outside species romance of human X furry, human X xeno, human X cyborg and human X mutant romance of two different intelligent beings who can communication with languages and all in fiction.   I mean Hatton Slayden’s amazing artworks, Bojack Horseman, Wolf Children, Beast and Carly on the X-men animated series episode “Beauty and the Beast”, Catherine and Vincent in the 80s Ron Perlman starring Beauty and the Beast TV show,  Alien Nation, Marvel comics’s Hepzibah and Corsair, Eliza and Goliath on Gargoyles, Mass Effect, Skyrim, Hellboy and Liz, Swamp Thing and Abigale Arcane, Vastra and Jenny on Doctor Who, Regular Show, Star Wars, Star Trek, Warcraft the movie, Rachel and Deckar in Blade Runner, Eliza and Goliath on Gargoyles etc. all have consenting intelligent adults.   As i don’t consider human x xeno, human x furry, human X cyborg and human X mutant romance as “beastailty” (which is almost like they said in the slavery being legal times and colonial times of mixing ethnicity) as me and Hatton Slayden believe in stories that cyborgs, xenos, furries and mutants aren’t always the “inferior” beings mainstream media would portray as but to me and him they are “people who are and look different” metaphorically. It’s xenophilia actually and there’s nothing wrong with two consenting adults who are different beings from other worlds, can speak different languages, have similar DNA, same parts like us/body structure even breasts to all that, high intelligence and all that even capable to have children. To me beastality if it’s someone who a person whether they are human, furry, xeno or mutant screwing an ordinary regular pet store animal as it’s a thing that cannot consent as humanoids have pheromones in their bodies to make different looking humanoids attracted to them like regular human, furry, xeno or mutant people. Earth humans, xenos, furries, cyborgs and mutants can all consent to each other as they all belong in the word “humanoid” and share intellect, similar DNA and all that.   And those examples from shows/movie fiction i mentioned are done better right?  the problem i have with the creature is he still is very animalistic and gorilla lower in intelligence, it had a child-like mind and didn’t act like a human adult with human level intelligence even speech. i mean if he an Abe Sapien type, Bojack Horseman type or even Mass Effect xeno male type of xeno, it be acceptable. In this, it felt to me like she was somehow either doing something akin to bestiality, or taking advantage of a man-like creature with a kids brain or a mentally retarded handicapped man.   Do you think the Xeno in this movie could had spoke a weird backwords sounding tribal kind language to prove he is an intelligent being  person who isn’t a pet or animal as no one can understand what he is saying as Elsie has telepathy and can read/translate what he is saying. Even with her doing telepathic communication with the xeno man to talk to each other in brains even when he is reading her lips of mouthwording then show he is very intelligent humanoid being with similar intellect with no just roaring/growling, him telling his history of being an alien being who came to earth years ago to become a god of a tribe he saw their culture on earth in the jungle even seeing them make art and music, him having a girlfriend before she died in his history, appreciating pets without eating them but treat them kind like he does with the animals in the jungle he lived in, wanting to learn how to cook as he saw some people of the tribe who worshipped him cooked but is curious to wanting to dance since he learned from tribal people but wants to learn like civilized people in cities do even for consent to want to have love if he truly loves her? even she can help Giles what xeno is saying as she can do sign language to Giles even write down on paper what Xeno is saying in his weird language?? those would had made the situation avoid the beastiality stigma?",0,2,Johnlindsey289,XFYWazblaUA,0.07015873015873018,2018-03-23 22:24:56,False,False

Fable, however, for adults where it encourages the zoophilia between the usual stupid little woman who wants to sweep a fish and the fish with the physical body but where everything becomes lawful in the enchanted kingdom of love. On the other hand, those who fight for traditional rules are framed as the agent with a paranoid mounted personality or as the ridiculed confectioner to be the usual racist idiot. Not taking into account how many of the stereotypes are based in fact on concrete facts. This time Del Toro made a mess just to please the idiot mass and sell the usual mash. Final banal and new expectations equal to zero with the rescue of her practically taken from matrix 2 only that change the powers of the superhero. The only peculiarity is the fact that the strange being has miraculous powers with which it could cure cancer and save the lives of millions of people and instead uses them to make the hair grow old to the receding hairline and give the gills to his girlfriend.

2018-03-30T15:30:49,"I don't think this movie is about  beauty and the beast. but loving somebody unconditionally. From her point of view, SHE is the beast (among human). When she met this fish she felt so appreciated and loved, that's why she loves him much, despite being beast or not. I don't think there's man out there who could love and look at her the same way that fish did.   This movie got best picture because it represents so well how fucked up todays love is. Love nowadays demands so much conditions. Someone who's popular, overly handsome/pretty, rich, talented, big booty, big lips, etc in one package. But one, doesnt actually have a decent mind and heart.

To add to the absolute hilarity of the plot and flabby writing (the ending was evident about 23 seconds into the film), the stereotypes were so 2017 Hollywood that people will be able to look back  in 30 years and learn of the obscene over the top sense of importance HollyWorld types have. A wonderful snapshot of how the movie industry stereotyped in the mid teens of 21st century. The idiocy being that they were trying to break existing stereotypes and in doing so  reinforced stereotypes their own sorry business has been trying to impose on our culture for some time now. Hypocrisy, stupidity, predictability you name it all washes up on the banks of a dirty river here. Two curiosities that were left unanswered. How does a lowly cleaning lady get absolutely any, never mind completely unabated , access to the greatest military secret of the cold war whenever she so desires?  Couldn't these guys in 2017 come up with a costume for our waterlogged reptilian chess master that didn't look as if it was stolen from the 1950's set of The Creature from the Black Lagoon?

I'm guessing the critics on rotten tomatoes are too blinded by the sex scenes to see that this movie in no way deserves the rating it was given. 60 maybe... This movie was a big thumbs down for me. It was obvious that its maker was trying to sell the story by hiding behind sex. If they include vaginas, bums, and breasts then the audience would cheer no matter how bad the story is. And sadly, it seems to have worked. Just wish I could get my wasted time back now. And to get an Oscar? I guess sex really does sell, even if it's with a fish.",0,0,SweetSea,XFYWazblaUA,-0.02264814814814816,2018-04-30 02:24:22,False,False

It’s such a seemingly nonsensical line, in fact, that I can’t imagine the title of this film NOT having been inspired by that very same song in some sense.

It's not a bad movie for, much like the original Blade Runner, it lives from the scenes and moments, not from the plot. Camerawork has glorious moments, the characters are as unique as can be. On the good/bad conflict del Toro goes through all motions we've seen already much better executed, say in Pan's Labyrinth. The setup is very black and white, but unlike a chess game isn't very clever. The empathic element that is key to the plot is so passionless and hastily conveyed to the audience it looks casual. Even TV scifi did this better years ago in 45min (""Darmok"").

2020-05-31T01:49:49,I got a mixed feeling about this film. visually it's really stunning and they did a perfect job in my opinion. the story is somewhat twisted and unconventional I guess. the concept is really hard to digest and the plot of falling in love with a fishy monster guy is kind of way too much imaginative.  its a good film but it may not be for everyone.,0,0,Uegene Dyalnburke,XFYWazblaUA,0.3453703703703704,2020-05-31 01:49:49,False,False
