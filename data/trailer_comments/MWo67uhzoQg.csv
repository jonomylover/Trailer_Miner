2018-07-31T06:29:28,"This movie has clear anti-white messaging.  It's saying that Europeans should welcome their own demographic replacement by brown people because brown people are actually better at being Europeans than the native population. The movie pushes the notion that all brown people have been victimized in some way (they were refugees in this movie) and therefore have every right to live in prosperous white countries because they need our help. To deny them this charity would be a validation of our original sin, which all whites are born with, and should be looking to shed. It encourages white people to let go of their culture in lieu of a more vibrant diverse culture. Anyone holding on to European culture and norms is tarred as being stuffy and irrelevant. And finally we have the most important messaging that white European women should breed with brown people and have brown babies. Anyone who objects to this notion is old fashioned and bigoted.

But we as the younger generation should recognize this propaganda for what it is and speak out against it.",0,2,Midas T,MWo67uhzoQg,0.19475940725940727,2018-07-31 06:29:28,False,False
