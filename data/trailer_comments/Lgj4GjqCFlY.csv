2015-01-14T00:47:48,"I feel like this is more of a psychological horror. Of course, this is extreme and wouldn't happen, but it's sort of teaching a lesson (at least I imagine it does). Teaching a lesson that doing that kinda stuff (posting the video, going along with the bullying) can hurt you very badly down the road, as well as the others around you.  Also, I imagine they aren't just logging off or anything because they feel trapped by whatever or whoever is threatening them. Obviously they're pretty skeptical of the guy until shit starts happening that they can't explain, unless it's some elaborate, sick prank. Also, it's kinda scary because I feel like ""billie""'s motive is to get the person to admit what they've done, and until they do, they have to watch their friends crumble in front of them. The billie guy is going to torture them until he gets the answer he wants, and none of them are owning up to it. The people who try to leave or cheat whatever is supposed to be happening to them, I believe that's where we start seeing some deaths.  I'm not the best at explaining my point but I hope this is understandable, and it seems like it has a lot of potential to be good!",2,0,harrison,Lgj4GjqCFlY,0.03706816059757235,2015-01-14 00:47:48,True,True

For a whole grain breakfast treat, replace 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour with 1/2 cup of ground oats. A grated apple mixed into the batter will keep the pancakes moist longer if you need to cook them ahead and bring them to the table all at once For blueberry pancakes, sprinkle fresh or thawed frozen blueberries over the batter after you pour it on the griddle. Mixing frozen blueberries into the batter before scooping will turn it blue and streaky. directions see this recipe's blog ¬ª 1. Beat the eggs and milk until light and foamy, about 3 minutes at high speed of a stand or hand mixer. Stir in the butter or vegetable oil.  2. Whisk the dry ingredients together to evenly distribute the salt, baking powder and sweetener.  3. Gently and quickly mix into the egg and milk mixture. Let the batter rest for at least 15 minutes, while the griddle is heating; it""ll thicken slightly.  4. Heat a heavy frying pan over medium heat, or set an electric griddle to 375¬∞F.

I mean, if they're her friends, and care for her safety, why would it be them she goes to first in her little spree? They can't have been the only ones present during that. 2| The motive seems wonky. I mean yeah, she was a cruel bully in her life, and it would only seem logical that someone like that would take it out on the people around her. But why? Is it to avenge herself? _She's_ the one who took her own life about a temporary problem, so that doesn't seem fitting. 3| The message seems hammered-home. Yes, it is a good message: cyberbullying affects so many people, and it can even psychologically harm said people who bully into doing irreversible damage to themselves or others. As people, we need to know that what we think is harmless can hurt people in ways that aren't just physical. I just wish it didn't feel so forced in this case. 4| This may seem like a bit of a low blow, but has Universal actually been well-considered for their quality in recent years? It looks okay, but the voice acting seems a bit hammy and phoned-in. If it's planned as a B-Movie horror flick, I'm cool with that; a little cheese never hurts now and then.

2015-01-18T23:04:36,"I think this movie is based on Rehtaeh Parsons and Audrey Potts suicides. (Yes, I know Laura is a fake person) It's basically the same telling. Laura is at a party with drunk teenage boys and girls. Rehtaeh and Audrey were at a party with drunk teenage boys and girls. Laura was either raped/drunk. Rehtaeh and Audrey were both raped/sexual harassed by 3 drunk teenage boys. Laura received revolting comments,text messages and posts about the way she acted at the party. Both Rehtaeh and Audrey received stupid messages and were called sluts/hoes. ALL of them tried/committed suicide(Rehtaeh went into coma for her hanging and turned off her life support machine on April 7th 2014) and did end up dying. I think it's nice that people are showing their concerns through movies and such, but a making a movie precisely based on both of these 2 girls and then continuing the movie with some stupid crap is revolting. What Universal/every other movie producer should do is focus on the real and important things about these girls death and take that thing and mold it into something carrying and informational to everybody. For example, Cyber bully. That movie stated the topic, showed the ways to deal with it, showed how to get help and also showed the consequences of your actions. It may have been educational, but it was also entertaining and fun. That's what these kind of movies should be telling.

Ghosts are malevolent spirits, not omnipotent demons. Oh, and the deceased was a vicious bully, so what I'm seeing here is that she couldn't handle a taste of her own medicine. Unless they change the plot, we can also conclude the last woman in the video will be the uploader and then somehow be saved, or killed. Not to mention, the lazy, and will-be-most-likely-overused, camera cut-outs, camera shake and feed distortion in order to compensate for the lack of logical flow, even in the horror genre. I've lost faith in the horror genre a long time ago. Every executive thinks the natural reaction to shock terror means that people are really terrified by it. Sometimes the fact that the evil in the movie DOESN'T act often and remains a constant threat to be feared is the scariest.

Turn off the devices If you are away from the call, you're fucked. Got that? Good. Now shut the fuck up, and get hyped for the movie, because this is actually original, and very good in my opinion. A few flaws would that I would include is WHOS COMPUTER IS PLAYING DURING THE MOVIE. Like, who's behind the computer of the screen you're seeing.

2015-03-28T10:31:12,"Im surprised that people are saying ''This is the most orginal movie I seen.'' granted the plot is somewhat different but the style they display it isnt. It has the making of standard jump scares and the title doesnt make sense at all but before I go on SPOILER ALERT, well not really since they gave out 90% of the plot away in the trailer (tell tell sign of a novice director). The original name for this film when it was shown at a film festival a year ago is Cybernatural, which makes more sense since they were never actaully friends. Laura was the standard popular girl who also bullies but things get reversed after the video was uploaded. The ''unpopular kids'' aka the group in the movie harassed her the most because everyone else was doing it now. For those who are saying that ''This is a anti cyberbullying film!'' Its not really true. Sure most movies like these are about bullying if you think hard enough but this is not a PSA. The director stated on the wiki page for the film he is already planning on making several sequals, his intentions is more of a line of making a revenge and gore film which explains the blender scene. The plot seems odd too. Why does she wait a year? Why didnt she seeked help? The best I can make sense of this is either she wanted to wait until the anniversary of her death to take revenge or she spent all this time spying on them and plotting. My best guest for her not seeking help is probably she either felt there was no hope for her or maybe she just didnt know where to turn (it does happen) but now thats just assumptuons.

True this is supposed to be a horror movie, but i think everybody knew this would not be scary so when watching, just expect to have a few laughs rather than screams. Id say it is not worth watching in theaters, however when it comes out on RedBox give it a rent and have some fun with your friends.   Also, about the notion of ""turning off skype"", the movie plays with that idea and shows why they don't leave. Props to the movie for that. Also it should be said that the movie is different from the trailer, many scenes shown in the trailer will not be seen in the actual movie, such as the guy getting run over by the car.

I didn‚Äôt even touch on the fact that at the very beginning, it said the video that caused her to commit suicide was uploaded on April 9th, but then later in the trailer, if you pause at the right moment, it says that video was uploaded on April 3rd. and finally, the plot-hole that sucks the movie in like a black hole, is in the trailer itself. The group of 6 meet up on the same day she died (how convenient) and she then comes into the call, somehow knowing it was one of those 6. And how she kills them? She takes over their minds (I guess) and makes them commit suicide. So, that raises the question of why doesn't she just read their minds and be done with it instead of killing 5 innocent people? oh yeah and how she fell forward after shooting herself in the head was BS. i dont have... the highest expectations for this movie, but if the whole movie is gonna be like this, they must have made a late April fools joke.",0,0,Cool Guy,Lgj4GjqCFlY,0.016791979949874688,2015-04-17 04:43:25,False,True

Literally the movie is how the trailer goes, they get into a Skype call, a random person is in it and they can't get rid of it (which I don't see why they wouldn't have just stopped skyping right then, while they still could). Laura is the person in the call, she threatens them and ginger girl is exposed then drinks bleach. She threatens them more, exposes them more, then they finally find a way to get her out of the call thanks to the fat guy. Then they stupidly keep skyping, which results in her coming back and killing the fat guy. She exposes them more and starts a never have I ever game and the loser dies. But first the guy with the gun gets something printed out and so does the main girl, each saying don't show them this or he/she dies. The other boy threatens to leave (which would result in him dying) if she doesn't show him, and she does show him and the boy gets shot. There's 3 left, more exposure, blonde girl gets locked in the room and gets a straightener down the throat. The main girl and guy are last, and Laura's last question is who uploaded the video, and at the last second of the countdown she admits it was him, so he gets stabbed in the eye. Then the ghost comes to the main girls house and kills her because it shows the end of the video that shows she's the one who took the video.

2015-10-05T00:44:53,"Okay, so...  Let me rant about this, because some people are apparently confused. *[SPOILERS ALERT]*  First of all, turning off their computers, like most people are saying they should do, won't help.  The ghost is not IN their computers, it's just using that to communicate.  It can still kill them if they turned the computers off or ran away.  Second of all, you have to understand that movies can't explain every single detail of why what's happening is happening to you, that would be too boring, not how movies work. Specially in movies like Unfriended.  They leave a few things unanswered to leave the viewer thinking about the movie afterwards and it leaves some space for your imagination to take place, if you put a little effort into trying to figure out why what's happening is happening, you'll figure it out.  Third of all, the ghost already knows who did everything.  She's just after revenge and none of the people that were on there are innocent. They've all done their fair share to the dead girl, just because not everything was revealed of what they've done, it doesn't mean any of them were innocent, again, the ghost knows everything.  Here are some things that confused people and my answers to them: *Ken dying from the blender.* I know that it might seem like having your hand ripped up like that won't kill you, but if you actually search it up, or use common sense, it does kill you. There's veins there and he could die from blood loss and other things, and not only that, but he also got his throat cut up. So if his hand and wrist being ripped apart isn't enough to kill him, that surely would be.   *Ken freezing for a good two minutes looking at the camera.* He froze like that, staring because he either saw the ghost of Laura, the one that appeared at the end of the movie. Or he got possessed, or both.  Or he literally just spaced out for a a good two minutes, it's not so odd after all.  *The kids, or let's say, young adults, being alone.* It's not really that impossible! Adam mentioned he was home alone. Blaire's father was out, and she could only be living with him. I don't know about the rest of them but they could just be living alone, or they might not have siblings and they're parents aren't there, they look old enough.   And finally, why the heck are people complaining about how ""unrealistic"" this movie is? There are tons of movies out there, not all of them have to be oh so realistic to suit your highness's taste. Go watch reality shows or something if you want realistic.  If you don't believe in ghosts and such things as spirits, and hate movies with them so much. Simply do not watch the movie, is it that hard? Keep in mind that all movies are someone else's brilliant idea and people put effort into doing them, a lot of effort.  The least you can do is respect the hard work people put into it and move along if you don't like it.   To each person their own taste of everything.   *Takes a deep breath*  So, yush. :3",0,0,Deerie,Lgj4GjqCFlY,0.02469604863221884,2015-10-05 00:44:53,False,False

For example, cyber-bullying and the fact that you can't really trust anyone nowadays. However, I don't exactly think Laura had the right to take such actions. Did she have a right to be freaking angry? Hell yeah. But what she did was a no no, taking into consideration that she herself was pretty mean to like everybody and she probably did some messed up things to them too. Maybe it was never to the extent that Mitch went but then again, there's the issue of individuality; what may not hurt me may hurt AF to another individual. So yeah. Oh and, Blaire mentioned that Laura acted the way she did because she was going through some things. Well everybody is going through stuff in their lives. So if that excuse was good enough to give Laura a free pass then it's good enough for the rest of them. They were going through stuff and that's why they did what they did. My point? She had no right to take such actions. Now go rest in peace for God sake and stay rested. Lolz.

Blaire betrayed Mitch, and kept that from everybody. You could tell Blaire cheated from early on when the spirit of laura presented the file saying ""not your boyfriend,"" and Blaire still kept her secrecy as well as everybody until they all knew of their demise. Laura wasn't only betrayed by everybody, but she was a product of people's want to defamate the character of others for their own enjoyment.  Yea I thought this movie was corny and I wouldn't watch it again because their is no point really, but I like the message it presented; people are disgusting and not to be trusted. I thought it sucked that ken died first, but it also sucks Mitch died even though he posted the video.

Attempted style over substance, unlikable characters ruining any investment in what happens to them, lack of atmospheric music, annoying computer sounds ruining the immersion, nothing creepy that plays on the psyche, lack of creepy visuals that could have been utilized, deaths that were as cheesey as  chocking yourself with your own hand reaching from just beyond the framing, relying too much on jump scares, and idiotic responses like holding a gun up to a web cam.  A horror definitely for the dull minded.  I could have shot a better horror film on this budget.  Sign's moronic aliens who are foiled by wooden doors and are weak against water were scarier and that isn't saying much in the vast world of horror movies.  2 out of 10 for this flop.

But if we stay very attentive, we could suggest that the movie goes even further than that, and allows a rather disturbing metaphysical interpretation. Unfriended proposes the idea that our immersion in the virtual world, which becomes stronger and stronger, ends up providing a real alive ¬´ essence ¬ª to virtuality itself. Unconsciously, we feed this essence while we dive more and more deeply into the virtual world. Through the time, energy and our various subjective fantasies and desires that we invest in the virtual world, we finally render the latter autonomous.
