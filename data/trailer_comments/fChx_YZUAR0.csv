People are more afraid of what they cannot understand, of what they cannot manipulate, destroy or counter - this is what made Baghool more terrifying, but, if you bring it out of the metaphysical realms, it's just another monster, we are made to figure out.

Second half got a lil cheesy and predictable. The Jumpscares arent the kind that everyone hates where its a pointless jump scare if theirs a jump scare its usually mr boogie. The first film didnt show alot film of gore either and left it up to your imagination which i think was really effective. I feel like this film is gonna take on all all the bad things from the first film instead of the good like showing mr boogie way too much.

The problem I see with this trailer, is that Bagul, the creepy mysterious demon from the first film, is revealed far to often. It's really the cardinal sin of horror films, you don't expose the viewers to a supernatural antagonist too often, as it lessens the impact of their appearance each time. I have some hope, the film at least has the premise of an investigation which always helps to carry the plot in horror films, but I feel that Bagul may be reduced from the startling and terrifying figure unexpectedly revealed in a swimming pool, to (queue the trailers music) just another generic boogeyman.",0,0,Schtiel,fChx_YZUAR0,-0.014583333333333332,2015-04-19 21:40:57,True,True

Mainly because you can only do one of two things: have the villain lose, in which case you more or less 'kill' any hopes for a reasonable franchise... OR, you essentially turn the villain into the hero, like was done with Jason or Freddie.  The problem then becomes that you're really just watching a movie about people being murdered with no other opportunities to see an actual plot. I'm hoping they didn't just turn this into a 'lets find new ways to murder people' sort of movie for the sake of more sequels...but it sure looked that way.

It was absolutely sickening to read so expect that to be the scariest part of the movie.  Other than that, Fishing Trip involves alligators and it's pretty corny, the dentist one (the drill seen here) is pretty gross and the kitchen electrocution is sort of fucked up but about the same level as the tapes from the first. The film opened with a hanging family set on fire and there's one pretty tame tape about a family being buried in the snow and left to die of hypothermia.¬†  All in all, the tapes are better but the Baghul stuff is ridiculous and stupid and overdone, the ghost kids are too prominent and the characters are sort of poorly developed.

At the end is that kid scared he's holding up an old camera? For gods sake my 6 year old sister laughed at that 4. Slender slipknot demon thing wants the kids oh no.... the family survives the end 5. Ghost show their deaths because.... why? 6. The song was more interesting then the trailer 7. Brother/sister concerned for sibling cliche 8. Kid sees footage of murder cliche  9. Mother wont let anything happen to her kids cliche  10. Kid shows sibling something relating to the plot cliche  11. House in what is basically the middle of nowhere cliche  12. ""Your family's in danger"" cliche  13. Demon has reference in all cultures cliche  14. Demon hunts family cliche 15. Demon goes after kids cliche  16. Demon grabs kid cliche  17. Demon scares protagonist rather then just killing them cliche  18. Cinemasins is gonna have a field day with this 19.

So... many... cliches cliche... wait what? 24.Demon scares someone in a photo cliche because.... it canÔªø 25. Family moves to a house where evil is cliche Ôªø 26. Can we finish watching the original Night of the Living Dead?  I can already tell that would be better then watching this movie. 27. Movie within a movie cliche  28. Also Night of the Living Dead in a horror movie cliche, granted it isn't very common and this isn't a zombie but point stands 29. This trailer is making me become cinemasins  Ôªø30. Also mom wont let her kids watch the original Night of the Living Dead? Thats probably the best movie they will see in a long time and she is depriving them of that 31.

Trailer reminds me of insidious and im ok with that and im not ok with thatÔªø 36. Family murdered cliche  37. Family murdered cliche againÔªø 38. Movie is released in August. What's the issue?
