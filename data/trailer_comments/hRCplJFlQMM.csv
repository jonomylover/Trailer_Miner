2018-10-10T21:44:20,I'm not going to go easy on this film. I love the original even with it's flaws. Because the original got the creep factor OH SO WELL down and was legit a feels movie. Sure towards the end there things got a bit funky. But it was still a pretty darn good movie in my opinion. I've wanted to rewatch it for a while. So i was so glad when i heard they where making a remake after how well the IT remake turned out. If they could work the same wonders with Pet Sematary i'm going to be so glad. not expecting something as good as the IT remake. But a film that irons out all the kinks and just improves what allready worked would be Amazing. So i'm putting my expectations high for this one. It might not be fare. But i'm not going to be fare. I'm expecting a great horror movie. That is something we sorely need more of. And the material they're working with here can make for one hell of a Horror movie. Stephen King is one of the best at his art. Sometimes not every aspect of his stories translate too well to the screen.

I red the book a few months ago and watched the old movie, and I still think that this trailer it's pretty good. It shows some important scenes that are both in the old movie and the book, like Pascosw's hospital scene or when Louis wakes up with his feet full of the cemitery's land, and these are pretty scary scenes. Church is looking pretty good tho, because the book clearly says that the cat looks the same, but it doesn't feel the same. It's not like a zombie a cat or some generic Braindead-like bullshit. It's just a empty body of a cat. When the cat touches Louis with his tail in the book, it say's that feels gross, but still looks like a cats tail. I don't think that the visuals will count too much, but the feeling it's what really matters.
