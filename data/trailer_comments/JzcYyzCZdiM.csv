2014-07-28T07:18:48,Many people are saying that it won't be the same without the games and you are partially right because the third book was different but I don't think you're going to miss the games. In Mockingjay Katniss points out multiple times that the war is almost like a game except the arena is everywhere and more people die and she's right. (You'll see that probably in Part 2.) And I'm really glad that they're splitting it into two parts because the book was from Katniss' point of view and now they have time to explore what happens in the capitol too.

2014-07-28T08:03:58,"First of all, to let the fans prevent them from jumping and attacking me, I'd like to say that I've been a fan of The Hunger Games for quite a long time now, since the first movie was even made. I've read the trilogy, sure. But throughout all the years of waiting for the movies I kinda lost interest to it already. I mean, the those who feel me, I'm starting to think this trilogy is becoming more overrated by those pesky teenage girls who only watch it because it's mainstream. I've lost interest on the story, and by looking at this trailer, (which, I know what's going on) it just seems really unexciting for me and just, boring without the actual Hunger Games going on.",30,16,JayIvan,JzcYyzCZdiM,0.06057692307692307,2014-07-28 08:03:58,True,True

The only thing that is missing is the arena of the games!!

I will"" which, to be honest - I don't know if it's because of the choice of words itself or the way she delivered it - I was not impressed with.

But twilight? That whole series could happen in a trilogy. (Just remove the awkward stares and the odd pointless silent parts and about four hours of that saga is gone) And then the Hobbit. 3 movies for a book that is smaller than any of the LOTR books which each got 1 movie?

It's not a book necessarily meant for teenagers, only because the main character is a teenager; it doesn't talk about youth and naiveness and love and guys. And if you read ""Mockingjay"", you would certainly know that it's about war, and its consequences, and life, and how to deal with our losses, and what death leaves behind in those who keep living, and social engineering, and manipulation, and power, and politics.

Katniss and her family seeking refuge in District 13, which actually survived the war, and was spared by the Capitol and kept secret because of the fact they owned WMDs.This first part also has Peeta (who went insane) and Finnick's disabled wife (whose name I forget) being captured by the Capitol and put on live TV, only for Peeta to reveal the Capitol's plans to bomb District 13.  2. The second part consists of Katniss and a team of rebels invading District 1 because it provides a defense for the Capitol. The rebels then attack the Capitol. However, whilst they are there, a large group of young children are bombed, as ordered by President Grey, leader of District 13. Once the rebels capture President Snow, Katniss is chosen to execute him, but she choses to kill Grey instead. President Snow then chokes on his own blood. In the end Katniss and Peeta are married and have kids. Ah, yes, and Prim dies.   While these events could fit in one film, I think it is best they are separated into these two parts, because of the way the first builds up to the second, and because of the way the second is a very obvious conclusion.",0,0,Samsung Shoebrain,JzcYyzCZdiM,0.10003092145949288,2014-08-06 10:45:19,True,True

2014-08-09T03:32:01,"Horrible adaptations from the books. Ever since Twilight came out every franchise based off a book has to have an unnecessary romance or a stressed romance. Sure in Harry Potter, there were love stories but in the 5th and 6th movies they pretty much dedicated the romances to one movie, leaving out many important stuff. And then they actually added a love story to The Hobbit, which I found unbelievable. Jurassic World comes out next year, and I wouldn't be surprised if they added a love story. And these love stories were made for 12 year old girls.  I was so mad with how they made the first movie, they left out so much, they didn't even try to set the themes from the book, and Catching Fire was even worse. They made the love story in the movie pretty much real even though in the book she doesn't love him at all, and the only person she cares about is her sister, Prim. But of course, stress on the love story that wasn't even real. Even if you watch the movie disregarding the books, it just looks like Twilight only made more violent. What is funny is that the only people who disagree with me are 12-14 year old girls who go crazy for the love stories and fap over things like 1D or Justin Beiber.",57,105,Koda Smith1,JzcYyzCZdiM,0.12229729729729732,2014-08-09 03:32:01,True,True

Yes, I know Mockingjay (the book) was a disappointment and lazily written, but there was a lot of points that the author merely touched on or hadn't thought of that were in the book, and the evolution of Katniss is haunting; the plot was also the most complex and mature of the three books. I feel like the darkness and drama, the brutality and devastation of war and the cruelty of the brainwashing Capitol, as well as the psychologically complex themes explored within the book, could be seriously expanded and developed upon in these films, showing stuff that could be happening at the same time that wasn't shown in the book, without veering away from the chronological events.",1,0,Mark McKenzie,JzcYyzCZdiM,-0.0722222222222222,2014-08-26 12:09:10,True,True

But how they filmed and edited the movie was terrible. it was like they tried so hard to have the most of the plot in this movie, and it was just terrible to watch, even though i can the book backwards, I couldn't keep it up. It was like the movie missed an hour? One of the few things i liked about this movie was the cast, and sam claflin. <3<3<33<3<3<3<3 So I hope mockingjay will be good. since its 2 parts, They will have alot of time to show us the story.
