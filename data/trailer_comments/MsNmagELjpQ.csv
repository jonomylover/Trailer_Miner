2015-08-30T02:18:11,"This is another unapologetically religious movie from the Kendrick brothers.  The budget has obviously gotten bigger and the acting is superb.  Here is why I think you should go, whether you are the least bit religious or not.  H.O.P.E.  In this time of uncertainty and strife, this movie offers a burst of hope that maybe we are not fighting our personal battles alone.  We all know THAT person in our lives who takes prayer very seriously.  Even the most die-hard atheist will often find himself at the doorstep of THAT person when life seems desperate because the prayers they offer up just might make a difference.  This movie takes the prayer room of the faithful and likens it to a combat ‚Äúwar room‚Äù.  How incredibly appropriate.  It is heartwarming, funny, poignant, and meaningful.  I see healing coming out of this movie.  I also predict an increase of jump rope sales, and even some closets getting cleared out.  I consider it a must see.

I know that I am here because someone was praying for me. My prayer life is so much sweeter and more strategic. And I know that I don't t pray for victory but I pray from victory. When Jesus said IT IS FINISHED, He meant it. PAID IN FULL!!! Prayer is a powerful weapon against the enemy and it should be our first response not our last resource. And when we pray God's word it opens the heavens. God said He watches over his Word to perform it and that it will not return to Him void but it will accomplish what He sent it to do.
