I always knew the original story was based in Mexico, so I never thought much of it. One night however, after taunting it, my  friend had to drive over that same bridge to go home. She ended up rolling her car just pass the bridge, trying to avoid what she claimed to be a crazy woman running at full speed towards her. She was so terrified that she even started to run from the crash immediately afterwards. I remember the funny thing was, at school when we were all talking about it-checkn out her scrapes and bruises, someone had mentioned that it was the ghost getting revenge. She gave us all a scared look as if she hadn't even considered it and said "" After i dropped you guys off I was just tired and ready for bed... I forgot we even went out there""   Nobody really believed her of course, including myself....but I also never took that road at night again.",0,0,B Money,MNp1LPm3Krs,0.01964285714285714,2018-10-19 14:34:05,True,True

2018-10-20T01:59:21,I'm iffy on this although it looks way better as far as production value than the previous movies I've seen based on la llorona the storyline & location concerns me as a Mexican who not only was told the story of her but also had an incident about her. 1st the way she says her for lack of a better word catch phrase doesn't sound right nor does it strike fear in me. The 1 I heard when told the stories & in my incident were scarier blood curdling & spine tingling. This sounds generic & sounds like a non Mexican national saying it. Might sound like I'm nit picking but authenticity plays a big factor for me so also the fact that it's in English is also a let down or at least have it in English but takes plays in lil towns next to rivers/lakes or any body of water not an ocean or sea. The jump scares where ok & the kids & others acting was good. To me this is gonna be like other movies based on reality or myths those that don't know the story will probably like it while those that do will be skeptical.,0,0,Tommy Gunn,MNp1LPm3Krs,0.0972041847041847,2018-10-20 01:59:21,True,True

2018-10-20T02:44:29,I want to watch this so bad but. I think it might be bad. First of all that does not look like the llorona. THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE BLOODY MARY. I'm mexican and I think a Mexican should if direct and make the story of the movie. Cause this is a Mexican legend. And the trailer looks nothing like the plot of the story. The legend is about a beautiful women who got sad because her boyfriend left her. And she got mad and then she threw her kids in the river. They died. She killed herself and she wants to go to heaven but god said if u want me to open the gates you have to find your children's body's so u can come to heaven. She is still looking for her kids to this day. You can't see her because she's a ghost. But you can hear her l. In mexico. If your a kid and she finds you. She takes you. She pretends your her kids body. but God knows it's not u. so she throws u in the river and you die. If you hear someone cry which sounds like a women and she say AYY ME HIJOS!!! RUN away from the noise because if u a kid and she gets to u. She kills u and takes u. If your an adult and she gets to you. You will get Bad luck. The weeping women in this trailer doesn't look mexican. The director is aisian. I THINK. DONT COME AFTER ME.

2018-10-20T16:06:28,"This is a very old Aztec story told for many generations so for people that say (it’s not only Mexican) sorry to disappoint you but IT IS! We were Aztecs and other indigenous peoples before we were converted into Mexicans by Spain. The story takes place in Mexico. Other Latin American countries may have heard about the story and know about it but not every Latin American country has their own “La Llorona” there’s only one version and one story that took place in Mexico during indigenous and spaniard times. Also, growing up with this story as a kid I was often told that this woman could be anywhere by any lake in any Mexican neighborhood and heard old people and elders always telling us stories about how they heard her and experienced her. I’m sorry but as a kid that never made sense to me it! Honestly those experiences by older people either had to be their own fears from childhood manifesting or another spirit of a similar nature. Spirits know how to manipulate and if they know you’re scared of “La Llorona” they can take that form to scare you into thinking it’s someone it’s not. The actual crime committed by “La Llorona” took place in Mexico. Psychic Mediums and even paranormal investigators agree that when a ghost haunts, they always haunt the place in which the event took place and no where else. Due to the trauma from the experience they have no ability to travel to multiple places because they are so fixed on the location where the event happens reliving it over and over again. If I went to the town where La Llorona died and killed her children and heard these stories of people seeing her and experiencing her often then I’d be more inclined to believe it since this is where it took place. However these nutjobs all across the US who’ve claimed she is literally everywhere by every lake aren’t really fooling me. Don’t mistake ancient folklore with your own childhood fears and don’t allow yourself to be deceived so easily by other energies that feel similar because like I said when a ghost is earthbound they stay where the incident happened and nowhere else! I’ve even seen Mexican parents straight up lie about their experiences with La Llorona just to have control of their kids only later admitting they lied and just used the story their grandma or mom told them. This just further validates that Mexicans from the states twist this story so much to they point where it’s starting to lose its folklore value as a good genuine folk tale.",0,0,Michael Martinez,MNp1LPm3Krs,0.11701754385964913,2018-10-20 16:06:28,True,True

2018-10-20T17:50:25,This is the story      Maria aka la llorona was once the most beautiful woman in her village.When everyone looked at her she was super attractive. One day Maria saw a prince coming to her village. Maria thought the prince was super handsome. The prince saw Maria and knew he had to win her. So he started acting super kind to Maria. Maria was charmed easily and they became boyfriend and girlfriend. One day Maria and the prince had 2 or 3 baby’s I think. They all were super adorable and Maria loves them. Each year Maria noticed she was getting less attention from the prince. A few years later the prince gave no attention to Maria and only to her child’s. Maria was super depressed and wanted to kill herself. So the next day she told her children to follow her. The kids were curious why they were headed to the river. That was until Maria through her kids into the river and sadly herself to. The prince then was getting bored and moved to another village to get a new wife. But on his way he got cursed by Maria and drowned. To this day she roams around the village crying and if she sees your kids she looks at them and if their not hers she drowns them   Plz like this took me forever😃😃,0,0,Erick Alvarez,MNp1LPm3Krs,0.2007878787878788,2018-10-20 17:50:25,True,True

That is pure terror right there and there are other reasons why that scene is terrifying for example you’re trapped in a tight isolated place that you can’t leave because you’ll die from the demon outside, you’re with a person who is questioning a lot of things and if you answer them , they’ll help you , but no time to answer the demon is trying to get in , so you do you’re best to hold this place closed and at the same time thinking of you’re friends,family,help,society, but you’re also focused and filled with terror and try to block anything filled through panic and terror and you try to make sure everything is locked and closed but sadly for the kid that’s when he realized he forgot to lock the door or the door wasn’t completely closed but if you and I mean 👉🏻  THE GUY OVER THERE, did lock and closed everything all you have too do is hold it as long as possible and 🙏 to god that you’ll die a slow death or you survive,           What I’m trying to say is this would be a terrifying experience.",0,0,DECOY MASTERMIND,MNp1LPm3Krs,0.0054894179894179615,2018-10-24 14:00:28,True,True

2018-10-25T02:08:12,"I saw her when i was about 6 yrs old at the Guadalupe river, my whole family went camping at the river, it was about 10 of my cousins and sister running around the river bank, i think we were playing tag. It was night time and there were stars out, on the other side of the river was this huge cliff wall, well i remember hearing someone crying by the river, so most of my cousins ran down to the river to see who got hurt, when i got to the river I looked up to my right and about 150' away I saw a woman glowing a whitish blue floating ontop of the water looking at us, she was wearing a gown and it looked old. Me and my sister saw her, and im sure alot of other cousins saw her and we ran back towards the camp all screaming. Im 26yrs old now, and I am scared to go near any bodies of water at night by myself, this was 20yrs ago and it was either la llorona or some extreme prank with someone floating ontop of the water with a led glowing dress in the middle of nowhere.  I honestly think that if you really want to see her, you would probably have to be a kid, and get someone to cry down by the river at night, I dont recommend it and ive heard ghosts cant harm you but idk she seems evil.

This is a very old Mexican folk tale, thus the movie should be darker and less predictable, it should be filmed in Mexico, or at least south of the border.  La Llorona is supposed to be a mysterious beautiful woman, sinister, and crying for the loss of her children that she herself drowned in a river.  Her story should be more dramatic than horrific, and her spectre looks like a phantom of delight to attract children in order to make them go to her, not this ugly monster they put in this bad movie.
