2019-06-13T19:18:06,"The trailer is good. Just a few concerns. For starters, this clearly makes reference to the Kubrick film more than the King Novel. Which is fine because that is a clever way to get some people interested in this movie.  But there were things in the movie that differed from the Novel.  In the Novel for example, it was straight forward that there were Ghosts haunting the Overlook. Whereas the movie while ambiguous leaned more toward the notion that Jack was always crazy and that the reason Wendy was able to finally see the Ghosts, was because the trauma from her husband trying to kill her and in her POV her son losing himself into the Tony personality driving her insane.  Whereas, this movie implies that the Ghosts were real after all.  The next concern is that there are things in the first novel that have not been addressed in the Kubrick film that would have been a precursor to the True Knot and their intentions. For example, the Hotel feeds off of and enhances the abilities of those that Shine. Hence why at some points the ghosts were able to physically harm Danny, because he inadvertently gave them the power to do so. The Knot while different from the entity that overwhelms the overlook, has similar abilities only they feed on a rendition of the shining known as ""The Steam."" Since ambiguity aside Kubrick changed the nature of the Overlook by giving it a sterile but typical haunted house setting, there is no mention of said entity, intentions or the precursor.  The next concern is the state of the Overlook itself. In the novel, the Overlook was destroyed because of a faulty pressure valve in it's boiler room, one that needed to be checked periodically to relieve the pressure. Whereas aside from some collateral damage from the Axe, and Jack throwing things on the ground, there was no explosion nor any damage for that matter that couldn't be fixed.  Granted Jack did murder a person and that would close the Overlook pending an investigation. However, the Overlook has had previous incidents implied both in the book and movie and Ulman was still able to leave it open. Meaning the dilapidated remains that have been around since the first movie, 39 years, would have been cleaned up and repaired easily during their summer times. The next concern is a follow up to this one, Dick Halloran's murder.  In the novel he survived and in the novel this movie is the basis of, he taught Danny new techniques regarding his abilities with the Shining. Specifically the Locbox Technique he used to seal the rotting lady and late owner Horace Derwitt, who lingered after the hotel blew. Because Halloran died in the movie and this takes place after the movie, then Halloran can't teach Danny unless they wraparound it by using his Ghost.  Which is next to impossible since Scatman Crothers is long dead in real life. That's assuming they want to use the same guy at all. Then there's the final concern, whether or not they'll bring back Jack in a certain way. In the novel it's implied that Jack's ghost helped Danny and Abra finish off Rose and that Danny caught a glimpse of him before going back home.  Meaning he bares some significance to the plot here. Yet there doesn't seem to be any sign of Jack Nicholson, Steven Weber or someone to double for them like they plan to with Wendy or Dick. Other than that I do look forward to this movie as I am a fan of the book.",1,0,Shanethefilmmaker,2msJTFvhkU4,0.0780938264633917,2019-06-13 19:18:06,True,True

However, I think we can all recognize now that the success of The Shining- as a film- was largely due to Kubrick's brilliance.

2019-06-15T19:06:25,"I‚Äôve got a strange feeling about this. On the one hand, something like this has happened before: 2001: A Space Odyssey hAd an inferior sequel called 2010: The Year We Make Contact, which was a decent film, but missed the point of the original. If that‚Äôs all that this movie is, that‚Äôs fine I guess, but what I see here doesn‚Äôt look exceptional to me. Call me a curmudgeon. On the other hand I have a dark feeling about these modern remakes/reboots/soft-reboots ... I often get the feeling that the film executives hate the frankly liberating effects that the superior original movies had, and want to dilute those effects by associating the original films with their inferior sequels/reboots. The filmmakers themselves are then, just willing stooges, rather than daring artists. Star Wars and Ghostbusters are two that come to mind. The Thing as well, with it‚Äôs 2011 prequel to the John Carpenter version, and the new Star Trek movies, which, though fun, very much miss the themes and tone of Star Trek, which was more about intellectual enlightenment than ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù style action. So yea, I get strange and bad vibes from this. I agree with George Lucas when he calls out Hollywood for having fear of creativity. I hope I will be pleasantly surprised, but I also somewhat wish Hollywood would take a 10 year break to write some original films.",0,0,Softboi,2msJTFvhkU4,0.16179841897233202,2019-06-15 19:06:25,True,True

2019-06-15T21:18:41,"Keeping it strictly to Kubrick, Danny opened the pantry door. No ghosts. No entities. Danny Torrance had suffered physical and possible sexual abuse (the bedroom scene where Jack calls him over to sit on his lap and Danny is clearly terrified) at his father's hands and became entwined in the same cabin fever induced delusion as his parents. 'Tony' was his go-to imaginary friend who offered comfort and protection, a split personality forged by Jacks abuse. Danny's idea of the Overlook being 'haunted' was due to Halloran's influence (Dick's 'shining' was intuition that the child was being abused) whilst Jack's sobriety and resentment towards Wendy had pushed him over the edge. Kubrick's movie was a metaphor for domestic violence. Yeah, let's make a sequel to the greatest horror film ever made. What could go wrong?    *""Yeah but, how did Danny see the Grady twins?""*    ""My wife will be absolutely FASCINATED when I tell her about it...she's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict..."" - Jack Torrance.    Jack told Wendy the story and Danny overheard it, the twin girls becoming a projection of fellow abused children. There were no ghosts at the Overlook, at least not the supernatural kind.  Danny is clearly terrified at all times by Jack, and it's Jack's power over him that makes him open the door out of fear.",0,3,MP R,2msJTFvhkU4,0.1524509803921569,2019-06-15 21:18:41,True,True

2019-06-16T09:19:04,There may be a chance that some parts in this film won't make sense because they were left out of the Kubrick versions of the Shinning. Namely if it involves Danny Interacting with his younger self. In the Shinning Danny's imaginary friend isn't really explained well and is pretty much left up to Danny being weird and talking to his finger. In the book and the mini-series that King worked on the imaginary friend is very important. Namely due to the Imaginary friend really being Himself from the future talking to his younger self via his Shinning ability. However once again Kubrick felt that this important plot point was dumb and chocked it up to Danny just being a weird kid that sometimes talks in a scratchy voice and talks to his finger; when in fact his older self was trying to channel though his younger self to warn his mother of what was happening.,0,0,Hardcore Hunter,2msJTFvhkU4,0.01479166666666667,2019-06-16 09:19:04,True,True

The boy fought that thing, and they boy won. It took eight years. The boy beat the thing on his eleventh birthday. After that, God erased his memory and sent him back home. It was more than three years later that the boy rediscovered his ""magic."" It was only then he began to remember what had happened to him. The boy encountered the thing he beat three years ago. The boy couldn't beat him down this time, because this time he was all alone. The boy moved across the country and settled there, trying to forget his past. One night, the boy discovered his abilities to influence matter with his mind. He now had a direct reference to his powers.

There's a great pic of Ewan encountering Liam Neeson at a film festival, and them pretending to have an Obi Wan/Qui Gon lightsaber duel.  I enjoyed the book, although I felt it was rather carelessly written -- several fairly glaring continuity issues, for instance. ""The Shining"" is a great book, and ""Doctor Sleep"" is a middling follow-up, which King probably wrote just so fans would quit asking him what happened to Danny Torrance. (I would also like to find out what happened to Charlie McGee, the heroine of ""Firestarter"".) I admit I didn't picture Ewan McGregor as Danny, who of course goes by Dan as an adult, but when the casting was announced, I thought he was a great choice. Abra in the book is white, and blonde, so it's an interesting choice to make her non-white in the movie. Rebecca Ferguson is a good actress and certainly pretty enough to play Rose.

A story where a man named Henry Ross, he is Tommy Ross little brother he witnessed his brothers murder that night at the prom because he was there. He was 15 when it happened. Anyway the story takes place 27 years after the events of the prom. Chris Hargenson wakes up from a coma after surviving Carrie White. She doesnt remember anything about the events, she is met by a man named Detective Terry Jones. He tells her you were in an accident you've been in a coma for 27 years. She remembers her name and her father but everything else is a blur at the moment. Jones asks her out for coffee they start dating. The town is celebrating the event of the high school massacre, every year Jones goes to pay his respects to his brother and goes to the cemetery where they buried Carrie and places her favorite roses on her grave. She loved White rose. On the day of his brothers birthday he asks Chris out they drink they laugh and then all of a sudden a girl walks over and says her name is Janet Nolan, she remembers her because she went out with her brother Billy Nolan. Chris starts to have sudden flashes in her mind. Flashbacks to the events of the high school massacre. Jones drives her to his place and gives her some water. Little does she know Jones put some powdered tranquilizers I  her water. She faints then a few hours later she wakes up and is tied to a chair in a basement. She freaks out and asks where am I? Jones walks over and says where you belong. She asks Jones why is she tied to a chair well its because she knows something that she can't remember. He places his hand on her forehead and her memories are restored. He tells her I was their that night you murdered my brother you killed Carrie white you killed all those people. She doesnt remember her brother until he tells her who he really is his real name is Henry Alan Ross. He is Tommy Ross little brother.  He has the power to restore people of amnesia and can project their worst nightmares. Anyway in the end Chris is in a psychiatric hospital and has been their for 27 years. Their was no Henry Alan Ross it was all in her mind. She rests for a while until she wakes up in a cemetery with multiple graves around her all with the names of those from the high school massacre. Hands come out of the ground and drag her under she escapes she runs until she sees a damaged car and its the ghost of Billy Nolan he says you killed me you little bitch. But I forgive you in this life but not in Hell! She wakes up and shes still in psychiatric hospital in a straight jacket she sees the ghosts of those shes murdered and laughs maniacally.

2019-08-28T21:18:50,"So much to unpack here.... I just finished reading the book and I just hope they don't screw this up. The original Shinning screenplay did not follow the book and that deviation is going to come back now and mess big time with what should happen in this story. I am already seeing the alternate shifts in the trailer and I am on the fence....I am sure that Kubrick did not foresee a sequel so he did what he did in order to satisfy the moment. It's also no secret that Stephen King did not like what Kubrick did with his book and I can now see why. As some people might already know, ""The Shinning"" is part of the ""IT"" universe, or the other way around depending on your fandom, but either way, the chance of crossing over these stories into what Hollywood likes to call, an ""extended universe"", is pretty slim. So many missed opportunities and so many stories that could have been told had they stayed true to Stephen King's original story. Hollywood might connect these two stories anyway because they are always interested in the money potential. I just don't see how they can do it with certain characters having been rewritten or removed altogether by Kubrick. Still, I will remain hopeful but the trailer doesn't do anything to amp me up for this film. I am big fan of the books but I did enjoy The Shinning film. The extended universe for these films is expanding with an ""IT"" sequel and this ""Shinning"" sequel, and I can only sit back and wait to see how Hollywood answers the call. In the end, I think they will just remain stand-alone films separate from each other. I will watch this film when it comes out but, I will not have high exceptions. I hope that it's at least a decent film. Lastly, I really don't think Ewan McGregor was a good choice to play this role either. Daniel Torrence should have played by someone who closely resembles the original actor, Daniel Lloyd. Chris O'Donnell, Jason Bateman, even Leo DiCaprio would have better suited physically and they are all great actors. Personally, I think Chris O'Donnell would have been the best choice in my opinion.

2019-09-30T13:02:47,The movie and book are completely different stories as anybody who watched Stanley Kubrick explain would know. And it's also why stephen king hated it. Half of the movie never really took place it was jack writing his horror novel because he was getting cabin fever. You can tell what's real and what's in the book by a few indicators such as furniture and when it's missing and the typewriter jack is using. I'd have to watch a little more to see where it breaks off but if I remember correctly there is nothing supernatural to the movie which is why king disliked it so much. Idk how this is going to directly follow considering in the movie there was really no shine. It was Jack's imagination and Danny's coping mechanism from being molested by his father. Unless they ignore what the film was about and pretend it directly follows the book I dont see how this will work.

He mostly made what he wanted and directed as he liked to a point even king got angry to him and left the set. The kubrick's shining is a piece of ART not a movie. Hundreds and thousands of analysis are made on it about symbolisms on genocide, mass murder of indians, sexually abuse themes and so on. His film is an example of real cinema and does not require a follow up. It is like adding a few notes or melodies from techno music to mozart's compositions with an excuse: ""It is not enough"" or ""it is not complete"". Thats the problem of this movie and trailer. I am not against new movies about stephen king novels, I used to read him when I was younger. I am against that they present it as a follow up to ""Kubrick's Shining"".

They don't stick to the original story and it takes from the experience for me.  There was so much more that they could have added from the book and they were unable to because of the changes they made to the original story.  It would have been nice to have the easter eggs that tie most of kings books together.  Like the mention of Charlie Manx etc.  If a person  did one of the stories just cut shorter, without adding their own take they would create a gold mine of possibilities.
