Dunkirk spoiled me because it was the most different war movie ever made and it just fucking nailed it. Dunkirk succeeded so well because it chose not to actually go the personal route and instead chose to highlight all the shit the actually matters in war. The fear, the sound, the suspense, the fucking will to survive at all costs. Every other war movie inserts this personal story into the mix that we've all seen before because I guess it pulls at the heart strings of the movie goers which is fine and all. If it works don't fix it. But I always want new things, and I think that is why Dunkirk is so incredibly spectacular. You hardly remember the names of any characters because it doesn't matter. You never once see the enemy, because it doesn't matter. There is no plot because it doesn't matter in this situation. There is one goal, live and get the fuck across that water to go home.

And over a million peasant Indians were sent from India to fight Britain's war, and even then, they fought bravely and turned the tables in favor of Britain. More than half the food and ships and whatnot that was used in the war were looted from India. And it's a well known fact that without the British Indian Army, the Nazis would've won.  AND YET. In a movie based on the ""grounded reality"" of World War I, we see a British guy running heroically through gun firing and bomb blasts probably yelling ""crikey mate"" without even a hint of any colored men who actually fought the war for them.

I can and will say the reaction of the soldier in the barn-like structure is really slow. These two were clearly not on guard and did not take any caution when approaching a hill with God knows what on the other side! Letting your guard down in war is like falling asleep when you are supposed to be the lookout. In war, you would be dead. If you don't think that the plane was coming down from whatever was beyond that hill and that it isn't being followed by a throng of soldiers you are sorely mistaken! Do you know what is coming behind that hill? Trust me, it's much worse than that plane! If you don't run in the direction of the plane/barn (cover) your dead already! It's not that he was running from the plane! Heck, the pilot could just turn and land anywhere even using the downward slope from the hill to land but the pilot was fleeing what shot him down in the first place from beyond that hill! The pilot was himself just trying to get as much distance and cover from those persuing him from beyond the hill! Any deviation from that direction would result in immediate death from the throng of incoming soldiers from beyond that hill! Once he gets around that structure he can use it as cover to continue to run from those chasing him beyond that hill.

2019-10-05T09:17:45,"Another war movie about one of the world wars? From the British/American perspective? Yawn.  Perhaps doing some research on other cultures during those parts of history would have been a nice change; it could really broaden people's horizon and maybe even rekindle interest with other countries/cultures that maybe don't get enough credit (there are exceptions, of course, however even then most films portray other countries/ethnicity as defenceless or hopeless. When in actuality there were a lot of defenceless people to be sure - but they were also a lot of heroes too; with and without a helmet and badge)  I mean, this was called World war for a reason; not American War or British War.   The worst you can be in a war movie is either boring (besides a few action set pieces, special effects, and some guy trying to find his brother in the trailer; there does not seem to be enough character or anything interesting in terms of a story driven narrative within the historical setting - it's simply taking the world war 1 template again and recycling it without much care besides the visuals) or insultingly inaccurate (and that trend hasn't ended with a significant amount of American/British films in terms of having a narrow scope of the war - thus a lot of the plots like saving private Ryan contain weak stories when it should have been the equivalent of Lord of the Rings with alliances from other nations, huge battles, character, culture clashes, etc).   What happened to studios taking risks (especially nowadays when we need it more than ever?) Universal is a big company; so big that they're currently collaborating with other giants from across the globe like Nintendo to work on a theme park and a movie adaptation of Mario!

But u never made a movie  or even a series neither any western media shown or written the situation of Bhartiya sena (Indian soliders)  during war... They fought against Germans supporting Britain.. U must know that 62,000 soliders died on battle ground and 67,000 soliders wounded... So total 75,000 soliders died in the war... Why??? They gave their life only because Britishers who exploited Bharatvarsh (India) who were also the rulers of British India at that time said that we will free India once we win war against germans... So this poor people joined British army and fought for them but here's one twist... After British won the war they took u turn from their promise and they announced more taxes on Indians to incure the loses they faced during First world war.... So what was that... Sorry but I have to say you people are so allegic towards truth that u never told or written this courageous history of Indian soliders in your History text books because u never wanted to show this thing to your future generations don't you??? You people made statues of great solders died in First and Second world war... U guys even made statues of animals who died during this 2 great wars but why you never made even a single statue of Indian Solider who died; gave up his life to save Great or I must say not so Great Britain... Shame on all of you... I do have a great story about Britishers what they did to Bharatvarsh (india)  during Second world war...

The old Empiric world and the new communist empire that seeks to make us all as miserable as those who sat in the trenches with piss, shit and rats chewing on their dead friends. My Great Grandfather won a medal for attacking a bunker alone and killing 17 men using only grenades and his bayonet. He was an Irish man fighting for the British army so they just threw him out to every hard location because his human value was lower than that of an English soldier. Eventually though he made rank and made many friends out of his battalion. Was injured 3 times also. He rarely talked about the war and use to have nightmares, waking up screaming and crying because of what he done to those poor German boys he blew up with grenades. My Dad, 'his son' once said when he was badly drunk one night he described in detail how he had to mercy kill a young boy because his guts were all over the place and he was begging for him to do it.

On guard, keeping a watchful eye, so tired, you lay your head against the wet sandbags, only to be stirred by any noise. Your knees and back feel like tooth aches. Mud and water, rubbers filled, while your feet were rotting. Just waiting and wondering. Navigating the trenches in pitch black, tripping and falling in the mud, the only thing to guide you was a voice, or cough. Just wondering when your relief would show, just to find some reprieve. Anything to pass the time, singing trench songs, writing, if you could find any dry spot. And then what seemed normal, suddenly was dampened by the sounds of artillery and the rain was replaced by shells.

It has been a long time since a really good British war film was made, the last I saw was 'Kajaki' ('Kilo Two Bravo' in the USA) from 2014 and that only really got made at all because the enemy were inanimate mines, rather than other humans. Nothing from the extraordinary Falkland's campaign from 1982, almost nothing from a hundred gallant actions in Afghanistan.  But then, of course, way over 95% of the British Army are straight white men.   My Company Commander in the mid 1980's, a man steeped in British Army history and ethos, used to say ""f...king good show chaps, f...king good show,"" when we did well and he was genuinely loved by his men, who knew his company of our regiment was the centre of his life.

The basic plot is a young corporal with a brother in another battalion is told to deliver a message to stop a attack that is going to run into a enormously strong new German position the men have no chance of taking. He picks his mate, a slightly older and more experienced soldier, to go with him.  This British film is based on the German retreat to the pre prepared, enormously strong, and well sited 'Hindenburg Line', early in 1917. The film gets a lot right, the uniforms look good enough. The German trenches are correctly shown as better engineered and built than the British trenches. The German's did indeed booby trap their old front line and they did destroy everything between their old and new frontlines, down to blowing up villages, cutting down fruit trees and shooting livestock they could not move.   I do have a few problems with the film. Firstly the British Army in 1914-18 (as in 1939-45) was a white BRITISH Army. Britain had African and Caribbean regiments, in the Empire,  but they did not serve on the Western Front in combat. Indian Army units, with mostly British officers, did serve, very gallantly, on the Western Front, but not in British units. UK was well over 99.5% white in 1951. Film makers and TV, please stop lying to support your fake political/social agenda!  Secondly why could the General not get a message dropped by RFC aircraft, as was often done? Thirdly a important message to stop a lot of men getting killed, to no purpose, might have rated a 'fighting patrol' (8 to about 30 men) under a Sergeant or even a 2nd Lt?  A fairly good film, I mostly liked, but please cut out the fake 'diverse' Britain left wing narrative. It is totally fake and everyone with the least interest in history knows it is fake and a damned lie.",0,0,99IronDuke,YqNYrYUiMfg,0.08102819967226745,2020-01-01 06:06:35,False,True

He was also a combat engineer who was wounded by chlorine gas and suffered its effects for the rest of his life after the war.  My father told me of his coughing.  He was a pacifist.  He didn't believe in taking life.  He didn't shoot directly at anyone.  He always shot to the side, or at the ground.  He also had so many close calls that he was convinced that the Germans felt the same way.  The issue here is not that 1600 lives were at stake.  The issue is that neighboring nations thought it was the height of nationalism, patriotism, and faith to kill their brethren, instead of enjoining them and marrying into them and trading with them the way the EU does now.  If those 1600 men didn't die tomorrow it would just mean the war would go on longer and they would die some other day, because they WOULD HAVE TO DIE for the war to end.  Nobody would ever see sense until they were forced into unconditional surrender.  That time it was Germany.  At some later time it was Mobutu, or Iraq.  At an earlier time it was China, or India, or Rome.  Idiots, all.  Can't people understand that the only way that anyone wins a war is to avoid one?

2020-01-14T06:57:29,"V. ""1917"" is a cinematic hoax  If you drowned in the boredom of ""Dunkirk"" and enjoyed it, you can now collapse of same boredom, taking a two-hour walk in No Man's Land, touted as a ""single shot."" What the advertising hoopla doesn't tell you is that it's EDITED to LOOK like a single shot. Oxymoron. This is the dry soul of postmodernism: glitzy special effects, wrapping a confection that purports to be an elegy to the eternal ""human spirit"" while glancing at the chance to promote war as a ""tragedy"" that no one wants but must endure--a most exhausted theme. It makes sense that this tired cliche' must be sold as a ""cinematic technical breakthrough, "" without of course ever mentioning precedents--that is history of cinema--which had already crossed the boundary of the long sequence in single shot by masters with pre-electronic technology.  Mention just two: Michelangelo Antonioni and Orson Welles. Not to mention Hitchcock's rather claustrophobic and theatrical ""Rope."" Oh, no--history would spoil sales. So do please line up to see this amazing breakthrough in the history of cinema that isn't. And what about the title--the alluring ""1917""? Didn't something far more world consequential happen in 1917? That's a  very naughty question, isn't it, one that such fantasies of the bankrupt Western imagination is calculated to bury.

One of the worst films I have seen in a long time. 1) The trailer ruins everything. 2) Not based on a true story, so I have no idea why the director made the decisions he did.  3) If you have ever played a 3rd person shooter, you have experienced 1917.  It is basically a playthrough of a war game.   And for everyone saying this is one of the best stories they have seen in decades, um...what was the story exactly??  Two soldiers have to run from point A to point B in 2 hours is not a story.  You're watching the back of a kid's head for 2 hours.  And, before anyone argues that I do not know what I am talking about, answer these questions first: 1)  What can you tell me about each character's personality, beliefs, or values. 2)  What was the character development?   3)  What was the character's relationship with each other?  Best friends?  Did they just meet?   4)  What are their backgrounds? 5)  What were their war experiences before the starting point of this movie? See...these are things you need for a ""story"".   As far as the cinematography, there were a few moments...but the cinematography was not any special.  This is not even close to Roger Deakins's best work.  This is some of his blandest work.   I don't like shitting on other people's opinions.  You can like what you like (except for the new ""Star Wars"" trilogy...which is just bad filmmaking, lol).  But, seriously...how did this movie get nominated for ANYTHING?  Even most of the score sucked.  The ending is pretty good, but..whatever.

I was rather disappointed by the  LACK OF GERMANS in the movie, the ones firing at the star running away from 15 feet away and always missing WAS LAME. We felt their was a lack of dead decaying bodies and body parts in the mud. Yes there was some scattered evenly here and there but I guess they wanted to keep the 15 rated movie.  I'd have made it much more graphic and horrifying.  Also the end scene shells comming down could should have had overhead air bursts along with the ground charges going up. Air bursting shells above infantry was the doctrine of Artillery anti infantry tactics. Not many British casualties the odd man falling down here and there.

At the beginning of the movie we meet a soldier played by the same actor who plays Tommen from Game of Thrones, and at the end of the movie, there‚Äôs a big reveal that his brother is the same actor who plays Robb Stark, it‚Äôs saying that a Lannister (he‚Äôs a bastard but the meaning is still the same) and a Stark could be brothers. It‚Äôs a way of saying that the two sides of the war that are fighting through-out the entire movie are brothers symbolically, because it‚Äôs in the nature of humanity, and all life, to love.

I spent my summer holidays with a few very good friends from Britain, France and Italy who I love and consider my brothers - the nations who fought against Austria/Germany in WWI. I am literally crying my eyes out, because it breaks my heart thinking that just over 100 years ago we would have been supposed to hate eachother & to kill eachother on the battlefield, only because some sick emperors & governments told us to. It would have been our duty to do so. They were spreading some false values of patriotism and pride. That was all just wicked manipulation from evil, powerhungry individuals. The exact same individuals who always wanted us to hate & fight eachother. Just the thought of me on one, and my good friend Charles on the other side, trying to kill eachother, yet thinking that we are doing the right thing, leaves me so sad. All those young people who could have had a bright future. All those people killing eachother, yet could have been best friends. Their fates destroyed by someone determining their future. It doesn't matter if they were German, British, French, American, etc.etc.etc. NOTHING! NOTHING good from wars. War is the worst thing that happened to humanity. DOWN with the ones who are trying to control/sacrifice others for their selfish reasons. I have nothing but CONTEMPT for those who are trying to spread conflict, all the emperors, governors, etc. who are responsible. I hope that after 2 WWs we are finally smarter and won't try to harm eachother anymore. No more brother wars. No more wars. Sending my love to all my brothers and sisters.
