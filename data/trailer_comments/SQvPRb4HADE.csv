I really like the sense of scale since they are going international which gives a lot of opportunity for cool settings for cool scenes, but from what I saw from the trailer this is a re-imagining  more so than a remake. Part of the reason I'm not excited is there are barely any things that remind me this is point break besides the characters name's. Its really unfair to judge it yet since this trailer just dropped, for all I know it could blow me away. I'll just have to see it and decide for myself. But I think a Christmas release is a bad idea since its so close to star was episode 7's release, and it will absolutely overshadow it...I mean come on, its star wars.

2015-05-31T05:54:13,"So why are they even calling this movie Point Break if only 6 seconds of this 2 and 1/2 minute trailer is related at all to surfing?  That's like if you made Silence of the Lambs but nowhere in the plot was Starling's backstory.  At this point it might make more sense for them to just call this Fast and the Furious 8 seeing as that might make them more money and less people angry and it's the same director as the first one.  Two favourite films of mine got remade by hollywood this year in a nostalgia cash grab.  First it was Poltergeist, then it was Point Break.  Even though looking back they both have their flaws, they both had at least charm and style that kept people coming back and inspired future filmmakers to make motion pictures.  The reason the new Poltergeist did not work was because all of the things it was copying from the original many modern horror films have done to death.  This is the reason this has a slim chance of being good. Films like Fast and the Furious have used up the formula so many times it is completely pointless to remake it.  Hopefully this remake and all of the other ones that everybody hates will be forgotten with time and the new, original, groundbreaking ideas will live on and be cherished.  That's the thing with bad remakes, they eventually just go away, and if you ask most people growing up today they will say they like the original Willy Wonka to the Burton remake and most will have no clue that Psycho was ever remade by the guy who did Good Will Hunting.  Sure it's a pain to see an action film everyone seemed to love remade for money, but in time the memory of it will fade and future generation won't even know this was a thing.  Also why does it look like Utah is smiling or at the least not looking phased by anything when he says his last line in the trailer???  I mean Reaves was not by any means the best actor, but he at least looked serious when the scene was supposed to be serious like the scene where he shoots his gun into the air instead of shooing Bodhi.  If something that basic is off the movie is heading towards a future of dollar bins in grocery stores across the world.",0,0,Evan VandenBrul,SQvPRb4HADE,0.12530130853994492,2015-05-31 05:54:13,True,True

I will tell you one thing though is when they are doing all the stunts i felt all the adrenaline and energy as if i was one of them. The overall action was good.
