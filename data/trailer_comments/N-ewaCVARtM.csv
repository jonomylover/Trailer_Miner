2013-12-14T17:30:33,"Are we forgetting that one of the main elements of this movie is the fact that a boy almost died? How is a movie with such content, about such an event, causing so much anger? If you don't agree with the overall premise of the movie and the events it supposes, the answer is simple, don't support it by going and seeing it. I see plenty of people claiming logic and reason in this thread, but generally nobody being examples of it in behavior. This movie, as I see it, having nearly experienced death myself, and having been put in a coma for a good half month, (though my experience lacked any curious phenomenon), is a triumph of how a boy nearly died, and survived. This is a wonderful thing that in and of itself should be celebrated. Instead, the celebration of this simple fact is negated by hate in the belief structure of those individuals involved. Those who are angry at this film for some reason aren't celebrating that fact, while those who may be inquisitive and want to see it, in probability are in some fashion or degree. This is of course not to say that faith isn't an element of the account, but whether you share in it or not shouldn't reflect or promote an anger towards people who do, that they're celebrating life, and may just happen to have the belief that heaven exists. It's also curious to me why movies like the fantastic film, ""The Sixth Sense,"" are socially acceptable to nearly everyone, and when one tosses the an element of faith into a movie which features spectacular phenomenon, it becomes an object of hate and ridicule.  Why do disagreements between social factions and belief structures nearly always have to equate to hate in some people? I find this true frequently on both sides of such arguments. Perhaps we should all try and find something or someone to celebrate this holiday season, rather than finding someone to despise, disagree with, or hate. You may find that you might be able to tolerate different views a lot better than previously. At least I have. There are movies that depict nearly every world view and if you disagree with it, again you don't need to support it. You're most effective means are not message boards but rather by not paying money to see the film. Yet, to trash on those who might enjoy it, or find it fulfilling in some manner is not a civilized way to treat, nor look at things. Even if one supposes one party is more intelligent than another, as some commenters seem to suggest, this doesn't make it ethical or right to attack each other so savagely as I have seen here. Its a movie. See it or don't. Thats your choice and most efficient way to make a statement.   Oh, and I am very interested in seeing this movie by the way. :) I find Greg Kinnear to be a fine actor, though his parts he is cast in sometimes aren't nearly as interesting, like in ""Stroke of Genius."" However, I think it will prove to be a fine performance by him and Conner Corum his young co-star. As of now and what I have seen I find it to be quite probable that I will enjoy this movie. If not, if it fails to live up to what I may or may not expect, at least there is the satisfaction that a young boy, who nearly died, by some means survived and within that simplistic particular of the story is a wonderful thing that should be celebrated.",0,0,Brandon Myhre,N-ewaCVARtM,0.10775785061499348,2013-12-14 17:30:33,True,True

2013-12-16T01:54:29," Only four authors in all the Bible were blessed with visions of heaven and wrote about what they saw: the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel, and the apostles Paul and John. Two other biblical figures—Micaiah and Stephen—got glimpses of heaven, but what they saw is merely mentioned, not described (2 Chronicles 18:18; Acts 7:55). As Pastor MacArthur points out, all of these were prophetic visions, not near-death experiences. Not one person raised from the dead in the Old or New Testaments ever recorded for us what he or she experienced in heaven. That includes Lazarus, who spent four days in the grave.  Paul was caught up into heaven in an experience so vivid he said he didn't know whether he went there bodily or not, but he saw things that are unlawful to utter, so he gave no details. He covered the whole incident in just three verses (2 Corinthians 12:2-4).  All three biblical writers who saw heaven and described their visions give comparatively sparse details, but they agree perfectly (Isaiah 6:1-4; Ezekiel 1 and 10; Revelation 4-6). They don't agree with the Burpo-Malarkey version of heaven. Both their intonation and the details they highlight are markedly different. The biblical authors are all fixated on God's glory, which defines heaven and illuminates everything there. They are overwhelmed, chagrined, petrified, and put to silence by the sheer majesty of God's holiness. Notably missing from all the biblical accounts are the frivolous features and juvenile attractions that seem to dominate every account of heaven currently on the bestseller lists.http://m.gty.org/blog/B121018",0,0,Betty Taylor,N-ewaCVARtM,0.05479797979797981,2013-12-16 01:54:29,True,True

2013-12-21T02:16:41,"In regards to stories about seeing heaven, there are a few discrepancies.  First, their stories vary a lot.  They aren't very consistent, which makes it impossible to tell who's testimony, if any of them, is real.  Second, some of them have names for God that wouldn't be used.  For example, an angel would never call God ""Jehovah"" since Jehovah is a made up name for God in the English language.  It's a combination of YHWH and Adonai made up about 500 years ago by English theologians since YHWH doesn't have any vowels.  Angels wouldn't call God a made up name.  Finally, there are only 3 biblical accounts regarding experiences in heaven.  Steven, the first martyr who saw it very briefly before his death; Paul, the writer of 1/3 of the New Testament; and John while he is writing the book of Revelation.  Being the first martyr and writing a book of the Bible seem to be pretty unique, and Paul says that he can't explain what he saw, and that which he could, he wasn't allowed to.  If Paul, the greatest theologian of all time who was also an apostle and author of most of the books of the New Testament, couldn't/wasn't allowed to explain what he saw, why are these people allowed to?  Unless of course they're not really experiencing heaven.  This also possibly explains why they presentation of their stories so charismatically and gaudily.  Paul said that after his experience, he was humbled by a thorn in the flesh in order to further humble him regarding this experience.  He also downplays it as not something to boast about.  None of these experiences correspond with Paul's at all, which makes it unlikely that any of them are true.",9,12,Josh Peterson,N-ewaCVARtM,0.08983585858585857,2013-12-21 02:16:41,True,True

2013-12-30T10:10:47,"This only promulgates my theory this is to grow his father's ministry or another that he's merged with. He's now in a pop band, his father wrote the book, and now there's a movie. There's no harm in money, but with religion, the standard is far higher. Amongst all the wonderful comments about this story, people, in my opinion, are really not seeing the real damage these parents are imparting on Colton.(!!!) These parents have a deep responsibility to their child to teach critical thinking skills, foster academic faculties, instruct him on what is real, what is dream, what is wishful thinking, what is embellishment, and what is imagination (which should be nurtured, though not to the point where lying and embellishment, over the years, would lead Colton to think creating any story, and calling it truth, would be alright to tell the world). I absolutely believe that he believes, when he was three, that he went to Heaven; and that his parents believe it happened as well. My next part is where it starts to become unforgivable on the part of the parents. After reading the book (*BTW, the movie doesn't follow the book and tries to make it more plausible to modern audiences, portraying the father as really being the skeptic - as it was the utter opposite in the book, since the father goaded it on from the beginning all the way to the publishers) it's astonishing that the parents gave such latitude in believing him. The father almost instantly believed him at three years old! His father sat on his bed and Colton said he saw grandpa, people are all young, and he saw the miscarried baby - it snowballed after that with them believing everything. To think, they think so little of a three year old mind. That Colton couldn't sense that his future sibling didn't come home like his parents would have made a big deal over when she was pregnant. Adding more (not that you need it) can you believe Colton reacting emotionally to utterly depressed parents after the miscarriage to place. Most likely, they went on and on about their lose. In tears and fighting. It's not a far stretch to believe, in any regard, that Colton wanted to make his parents feel better, as kids continually prove to be so insightful on what we think they aren't. On a more skeptical note, It could even be that Colton was feeling left out because the parents were grieving so much that he put the spotlight back on him. That's not mean, insidious, or sinister on his part. It's just being a 3 to 4 year old wanting your parents happy in order to play with you and pay attention to you. Did the parents ever ask themselves any of this. Mainly, did they ever ask themselves if there's just one part of the story that they ""don't"" believe? If they haven't even asked that question or believe some of it as embellishment or out right lying that is all that needs to be said. Since we all know that kids pick up on what interests their parents, children have always liked to be rewarded emotionally with allying their interests with their parents' - and actively taking part in their parents interests. This is to become part of the parent's interests or the center of it, so they become the center in their parents interests - as almost all kids crave at that age. As parents, we all know this. This child is really being taught a disservice that will, in no way, prepare him for life. Critical thinking is the backbone of human thought processing. I'm not even discussing disbelief. Just plainly knowing what should be understood and delineated as reality, embellishment, and lying. Moving on, every one thinks this message is so wonderful. What I'm mostly happy about is that he lived and those poor parents didn't have to lose a 3 year old child. What exactly is inspirational about a story that just reiterates my childhood religious archetypes of Heaven, Jesus, the saints, Satan, and God (my whole church had St. Michael holding the staff with a sword keeping Satan down and other saints holding swords, as to illustrate the 1st battle in Heaven). I knew about this at his age and even went to confession and pre-K bible study. Add on that his father is a paster who discusses, writes, and practices his sermons at home, teaching his child along the way. Imbuing him with this worldview and very interesting story that kids grasp on to. There's fantasy, violence, imagery, color, simplistically laid out good and evil, and good concurring evil, as Colton's main stories were about - not the confusion of so many of the verses of the bible about good and evil. In fact, from beginning to end, as Colton reveals more as he gets older, because he ""remembers"" more as he gets older (more like he exposed to further scripture) and yet, ""conveniently,"" forgets hard facts when asked. So then are we to believe that Colton's Heavenly revelation becomes more sophisticated with age (as does our own cognition) or does he forget (realizing he can't answer hard factual questions)? What would be inspirational in this story, is if in God's supreme ability, Colton would be imbued with knowledge for the so many non-believers of the world and of other religions to come to Jesus - not just a retelling of my Sunday school classes. Even if he were to just reveal certain facts as he got older; because some would argue that he was just three, thus too young for it all, that just doesn't hold up. God has the power. At three, Colton illustrated so many things in detail from religious archetypes that we're taught, even at three and it's too much to ask him for a tidbit of information that could really be useful. Lastly, this whole story, from start to finish, came off as a movie from Colton's telling and the father's book, because he comes from a media age, entrenched in cinema. I can read a bible and other materials and retell Colton's experience. I'm not here to put Colton down, as I'm utterly greatly he survived. I'm commenting on this so verbosely because the parents are responsible to for this young mind and I hope no one here thinks this is harmless because it's a simple Heaven story. Think about this carefully. He is still, at 13-14, saying this to the world. He is learning nothing of true academic study, critical thinking, being an honest human being that tells the truth and doesn't lie or embellish. This is the problem. We can't just throw him aside because he's not an adult who will rarely change their mind, but in this country, and all of the world, kids are our future. Their success is on us. If we don't care if kids grow up to lie or not, then there isn't hope for true discourse, academia, and critical thinking faculties.

Why can't he just give us a straight answer instead of hiding behind some magical plane of existence which we can't detect or sense in any way that can't also be explained through science and reason? Why is it that the only recorded miracles and prophecies and incarnations supposedly happened back when we had no way of accurately recording the events, leaving everything completely ambiguous and dividing it into thousands of different interpretations that would soon start global wars that tear lives into pieces and destroy humanity more and more every minute? Why must the only way to understand religion and God is through faith - not only in something that can't be proven, but also AGAINST many facts that have evidence to them? Why can't it just be easy to find out whether God exists or not? And why must there be an eternal, torturous punishment attached to a life of questioning and skepticism, both of which are natural human characteristics? And why do people take this story mentioned in the video as proof enough to believe in God and Heaven and Christianity when it could have easily been fabricated and manipulated by the authors to fit a more glamorous description, and at the same time bring in enough profit to pay for the boy's ridiculously high American hospital bill?  In other words, why must the most important question of all be answered through faith alone, while all other questions can be answered through logic and critical thinking?

I have a few questions I would absolutely love a logical answer to, ""god is powerful"" and ""just because"" are not logical answers. if you die as a baby, are you reborn in heaven as an adult? what age do you appear in heaven since the grandfather was young. do you age in heaven? if so what's the age cap? if a baby and the mother dies during childbirth, how will she recognize the child in heaven?  who pulls babysitter duty? are morbidly obese people that can't move without help skinny in heaven? are mentally disabled people normal? if you do age, how do you grow? considering your body develops according to your diet and workout regime does everyone follow a pre-set path, because I assume there's no planet fitness or whole foods in heaven. isn't it horribly overpopulated? how do you find eachother, do you just think real hard and there you are? would it be rude to challenge jesus to an arm wrestling match? if I sin, can I be kicked out of heaven?",1,1,Jimothy Snooker,N-ewaCVARtM,-0.04312499999999999,2014-01-15 23:47:00,True,True

2014-03-11T16:28:14,"A critique of the book that made this awesome super real life, true story movie with no flaws whatsoever (well maybe a few).    ""Heaven Is For Real""...  This book tells the story of four year old Colton Burpo, now 12, from the perspective of his father Todd (a Christian minister).  Long story short, the family claims that Colton went to heaven, during a near death experience on the operating table (his appendix burst).  According to the timeline given, at the back of the book, Colton was actually three when he had these experiences (but four by the time he began talking about them).  Let's get straight to what I think is the best of the hard ""evidence""; the book claims that...  a) Colton met his great grandfather, ""Pop"", who had died 30 years earlier (and later supposedly recognized a picture of Pop, as a young man, since ""no one is old in heaven"").  b) Colton knew what his parents were doing, including where they were, while he was unconscious on the operating table.  c) Colton talked to his sister, a child that miscarried years earlier (and that he purportedly knew nothing about).  Now, as we'll see, these weren't the only things that Colton did during his short time (three minutes) in heaven.  Not by a long shot.  But, never fear, Colton had plenty of time to squeeze it all in since (as chapter fourteen reminds us) ""a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day"", on heaven's timetable.  Initially, Colton speaks ""only"" of sitting on Jesus' lap, in the hospital, while the angels were singing to him.  From the prologue...  ""'Well, they sang 'Jesus Loves Me' and 'Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho,'' he said earnestly.  'I asked them to sing 'We Will, We Will Rock You', but they wouldn't sing that.'""  Cute.  Later on, Colton's parents begin to suspect that he had much more than an out of body experience (as if that weren't enough to process).  How exactly he got from the hospital room, with Jesus and the angels, to heaven itself is never explained.  I mean, did they fly?  Did Jesus snap his fingers, teleporting everyone instantly from one location to the other?  The reader is left to wonder.  Listen as Todd Burpo describes the very moment he realized his son had actually been to heaven...  ""Just as I was processing the implications of my son's statement---that he had met John the Baptist--Colton spied a plastic horse among his toys and held it up for me to look at.  'Hey Dad, did you know Jesus has a horse?'  'A horse?'  'Yeah, a rainbow horse.  I got to pet him.  There's lots of colors.'  Lots of colors?  What was he talking about?  'Where are there lots of colors, Colton?'  'In heaven, Dad.  That's where all the rainbow colors are.'  That set my head spinning. Suddenly I realized that up until that point, I'd been toying with the idea that maybe Colton had had some sort of divine visitation.  Maybe Jesus and the angels had appeared to him in the hospital...Now it was dawning on me that not only was my son saying he had left his body; he was saying he had left the hospital!""  For a short time this creates some cognitive dissonance in Todd since, after all, Colton didn't actually die on the operating table.  So, how could he go to heaven if he didn't die?...  ""Then I remembered that the Bible talks in several places about people who had seen heaven without dying.  The apostle Paul wrote to the church at Corinth about a Christian he knew personally who was taken to heaven...""  Problem solved.  One of the more intriguing revelations comes in chapter 13...  ""This statement marked the beginning of a period that I wished we had written down.  During this conversation and for the next year or so, Colton could name a lot of the kids he said were in heaven with him.  He doesn't remember their names now, though, and neither do Sonja nor I.""  How unfortunate (and convenient).  As the book continues Colton reveals a number of other juicy nuggets, about heaven, such as the fact that Jesus is the only one who doesn't have wings.  Apparently, he just goes ""up and down like an elevator"".  Oh, and everyone there has ""a light above their head"".  Colton also got to literally see Jesus shooting down power, to his Dad, during sermon time in church.  How cool is that?!  But things get even weirder as the book rolls on.  According to chapter 25, ""the angels carry swords so they can keep Satan out of heaven"".  Listen, as Todd comments on his son's most recent revelation...  ""But how did a six year old know that?  Yes, Colton had had two more years of Sunday school by then, but I knew for a fact that our curriculum didn't include lessons on Satan's living arrangements.""  Todd continues...  ""'Hey Colton, I bet you asked if you could have a sword, didn't you?' I said.  At that, Colton's smile melted into a dejected frown, and his shoulders slumped toward the floor.  'Yeah, I did.  But Jesus wouldn't let me have one.  He said I'd be too dangerous.'  I chuckled a little, wondering if Jesus meant Colton would be a danger to himself or others.""  And a few minutes later...  ""'Hey Colton', I said. 'Did you see Satan?'  'Yeah, I did,' he said solemnly.  'What did he look like?'  At this, Colton's body went rigid, he grimaced, and his eyes narrowed to a squint.""  And I highly recommend you buckle your seatbelt, because things get even more bizarre in chapter 26.  Listen, as Colton tells his Dad all about ""the coming war""...  ""'There's going to be a war, and it's going to destroy this world.  Jesus and the angels and the good people are going to fight against Satan and the monsters and the bad people.  I saw it.'  I thought of the battle described in the book of Revelation, and my heartbeat skipped up a notch. 'How did you see that?'  'In heaven, the women and the children got to stand back and watch.  So I stood back and watched.'  Strangely, his voice was sort of cheerful, as though he were talking about a good movie he'd seen.  'But the men, they have to fight.  And Dad, I watched you.  You have to fight too.'""  And later in the chapter...  ""'Yeah, Dad but it's okay,' he said reassuringly.  'Jesus wins.  He throws Satan into hell.  I saw it.'""  Alright, I think you get the idea.  Let's re-cap...the angels sang (at least two) songs to Colton while he was sitting on Jesus' lap, still in the hospital.  At some (unspecified) point afterward, Colton and company went to heaven (instantly?), at which time Colton had more conversations with Jesus, John the Baptist, his great grandfather, his sister, and possibly others.  Then, Jesus gives Colton several super cool demonstrations, including one of him zapping down power to his Dad during church services, as well as a (movie like) preview of the final battle between good and evil. For the big finale Jesus tops it all off by showing Colton what it will be like when Satan is thrown into Hell once and for all.  Wow!!!  Oh, and did I mention that God is ""really, really big"" and that Colton also saw the thrones that God, Jesus, and the angel Gabriel actually sit on?  In between all of this, Jesus also managed to relay several messages to Colton, most notably that ""he had to be good"" and that ""Jesus really loves the little children"".  I hope you'll forgive me for that (rather lengthy) summary, but, I felt it was important to set the stage, as fully as possible, before giving my personal opinions on ""Heaven Is For Real"".  Frankly, it's always difficult to critique books like this.  I very much want to respect people's personal stories and, really, who am I to tell the Burpo's what did or didn't happen to Colton?  I don't even know these people.  Having said that, by way of disclaimer, I'd now like to offer a few speculative thoughts on why I personally did not find this story convincing.  First off, I couldn't help but notice that neither Todd or Sonja ever question the veracity of anything that Colton says about his supernatural experiences.  Ever.  It seems they became fully convinced of the story's legitimacy, right from the get go, because of details that Colton supposedly revealed during that very first conversation about it (the one re: Jesus and the angels in his hospital room).  It's as if they give Colton a free pass, after this point, and believe literally everything he tells them over the next several years.  Everything.  This struck me as somewhat odd since, as a parent myself, I know that kids tend to mix truth and falsehood together in a way that adults typically don't.  So, frequently there are nuggets of truth to what a child is saying, but that doesn't automatically entail that every word of it is 100% accurate.  This is where parents need to step in, with discernment, to gently help the given child sort out fact from fiction.  Secondly, while Todd makes it very clear that he was careful not to plant ideas in Colton's head, it never seems to occur to him that Colton may be embellishing the story in order to please his parents.  Now, I'm not suggesting here that Colton is lying, intentionally, but kids have a way of picking up on the fact that parents are especially interested in a particular topic.  And often they continue on, with that topic, because of how the parents are reacting to it, and this tends to lead (even inadvertently) to embellishment.  In my own experience, as a parent, this is especially true prior to the age of about 7 or 8, after which time it tends to naturally ease up a bit, as the child matures.  But, by this age, Colton would have been several years into the re-telling, having received affirmation over and over again (through both verbal and non verbal cues) that his experience was real.  Any window, for self reflection and analytical thought, on Colton's part (ie. that perhaps he overheard more than he realized, and/or that he had a dream, and/or that perhaps he knew some of these things from church or Christian books etc. etc.), would long since have passed.  In other words, I think that Colton now believes that he really went to heaven.  But, remember, he was 3 years old when this happened.  How likely would you be, to completely trust your memory (much less interpretation) of most anything that happened when you were 3 years old?  Lastly, this book seemed to lose credibility as the story went on.  Many of the really rad parts, about what happened in heaven, seem to only have been revealed by Colton years after the fact. Now, Todd would likely claim that this is because he didn't want to push Colton too hard, but actually it seems, from the book, that Colton was typically very eager to talk about it whenever the subject was broached.  In short, my tentative conclusion is that Colton's parents are, in all likelihood, simply more credulous than they ought to be.  As one of the reviewers on Amazon has put it, they probably owe Colton an apology; for believing every word of what he has told them.  They are, after all, his parents, and it's up to them to help Colton learn to think carefully.  So my question to the Burpo's would be this...has Colton said anything, about heaven, over the past 9 years, that you don't believe?  Anything at all?  If the answer is ""no"", this should ring alarm bells.  Some (ok, all) of this stuff is pretty fantastic, and it would seem that the story pretty much rises and falls together, becoming increasingly more implausible as multiple new layers are added, by Colton, year after year after year.  I should mention that I've also watched numerous videos, of both Colton and his Dad, discussing this experience (just google it and you'll find plenty).  And, I don't mean this to sound like nitpicking, but, I have to say that I find Colton even less credible in person than I do in print.  It comes off to me as if he is just parroting the same answers over and over.  And he uses an awful lot of biblical phrasing and terminology when he is ""remembering"" things...let's just say it's quite easy to tell this kid spends a great deal of time in church.  Some will no doubt accuse the Burpo's of manufacturing the whole affair.  Let me state, plainly, that I do not believe this to be the case.  I believe that they believe it.  But one also has to wonder, if this were in fact real, than what's the point?  Is God hoping this story will convince the skeptics?  Then surely he would've revealed something to Colton (about future events, perhaps?) that might have a hope and a prayer of accomplishing these ends.  As it happens, ""Heaven Is For Real"" has just enough in it to be interesting (thus the bestselling status) but not nearly enough to be convincing to anyone with a sufficiently critical eye.",1,0,daniel gilbert,N-ewaCVARtM,0.12526520932770926,2014-03-11 16:28:14,True,True

I said back to her ""...yeah as much as it can be right now"" ( because I was thinking about her and thinking about all the good time that we had and crying)... My Mom told me to go inside, call her Mom and tell her to ""STOP IT! Your making yourself sick Mom""!!! So I went inside and called my grammie and first told her what I experienced then asked her what she was doing 2 minutes ago... she told me that she was talking to my Mom's picture crying ( my Grammie has health problems and crying and feeling bad doesn't help her condition). By the way, I live by Huntington Beach and my Grammie lives in the San Gabriel Valley aka L.A. so I wasn't anywhere near her. So all that I can say is that God IS REAL and is GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2014-03-20T18:48:16,"Be very cautious of what you read/listen to/hear online. These popular (controversial) false testimonies of HEAVEN and HELL videos are false. They are spreading like a tumor. It's every where on Youtube for crying out loud. In Colossians 2:18, Paul said, ""Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions."" No earthly man of this generation had or could go up to heaven to bring forth spiritual knowledge/to bring from thence the spiritual knowledge of divine and heavenly things; in which sense the phrase is used in verse Deuteronomy 30:11-12 and which may be illustrated in verse John 3:13, also in verse John 1:18. All the spiritual knowledge that we can get today is through the bible that has already been recorded in the book of the law. No one should go in the book of the law/No one should go create themselves a book for ill-gotten gain/profit and add to God's word or subtract to God's word according to verses Revelation 22:18-19 and Deuteronomy 12:32. There are many self proclaiming Christians who are really Anti Christ that are leading many people astray with their reckless lies and with their reckless heresies. They twist the words of the bible to their own destruction and spread their delusional interpretations of the bible to naive people who hate the real truth that comes from the bible.  ======================================================  First of all, heaven is not a dwelling place for humans to explore, eat, and play. Heaven is God's throne where Jesus sits according to verse Isaiah 66:1 and where the 24 elders sits according to verse Revelation 4:4 which says, ""Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads."" Also read verses Matthew 5:34-35, Matthew 23:22, Matthew 19:28, Matthew 25:31 and Luke 1:32-33.  The correct term to say is ""THE KINGDOM OF GOD"" or ""THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN"" which has not yet come according to verse Luke 17:20-37.  Second of all, when a person dies without being buried at all, but is lifeless on the ground for days, the person's flesh will slowly turn into dust (a.k.a. ashes) and their dust will go straight from the ground/to the dust according to verses Genesis 3:17-19, Ecclesiastes 3:20 and Psalm 103:14-16. The same goes for a person who is/was buried which is called the grave. That is ""THE FIRST DEATH.""  Last of all, in the end of the age, when God the Father destroys the earth and those under heaven, as well as to vanish the heavens with a great roar according to verse Matthew 5:18; 2 Peter 3:10; Isaiah 24; Isaiah 34; Isaiah 51, God will then resurrect the dead and the Hades. The angels will separate the evil from the good, the Lord will judge them according to their conduct, and then the angels will send the evildoers to the fiery lake of burning sulfur where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 13:49-50/Matthew 13). That will be ""THE SECOND DEATH"" (Revelation 20:14-15). Then after that, God will create a new heaven and a new earth (for the righteous). ""The New Jerusalem"" (a.k.a. The Kingdom of Israel/God/Heaven) that will come down out of heaven will be the new holy city that will be placed on the new earth (Revelation 21).  ""The New Jerusalem"" is referred to ""The Kingdom of Israel"" according to verse Acts 1:6-11. The Kingdom of Israel/God/Heaven will come after God destroys the devil's work (meaning to destroy Satan's counterfeit power and dominion).  READ: 1 Corinthians 15:20-28/1 Corinthians 15:23/1 Corinthians 15, Daniel 12:1-4/Daniel 12:11-13, John 5:19-30, Acts 24:15, Isaiah 29:4-8 and 2 Thessalonians 1:3-12.  ======================================================  Read 1 John 2:18; It says, ""Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour.""  Also read verses: Matthew 7:15-23 and 2 Peter 2:1/2 Peter 2.",0,1,Nakita Benjamin,N-ewaCVARtM,0.0730583613916947,2014-03-20 18:48:16,True,True

I came from begging for a sign as a kid, crying out to Him, to completely turning my back on Him, cursing him for what I went through, and having an extreme hatred for Him, and those who followed His word. I have realized I am not religious, but truly spiritual. Through this story, whether real or not, it has changed my life. It has given me hope, in a life where so much despair was felt. I believe this story is real, and if you don't, I truly know how hopeless in life you feel. Don't conform to the beliefs of others because its what they tell you to do. Question everything, His existence, His word, and everything that has ever been written. Than take your findings and create your own interpretation. That is what I did, everything this book says may not be truth, nor many things in the Bible, but if you take the overall outlook and what its trying to interpret for you, than you will realize that it is nothing more than a positive outlook on this world. Yes, there is so much hatred, so much destruction, but on the other end of the spectrum, there is absolute beauty, absolute miracles, and obvious changes on a sub conscience level that couldn't be taken other than being divine intervention. It will show you how to live a life as a loving person, and show you a path to self-happiness. I couldn't be more happy in my life, because of Him and the work that has been made in His name. For the changes in my life, I know he exists, that he touches all of us, whether we feel it or not, and no matter what, this life is a mere glimpse into what we can achieve with everlasting ecstasy. I love you, He loves you, and if you have the opportunity to see a speck of what He has tried to show you, than you will truly understand what I am saying.  ",0,0,minusbear25,N-ewaCVARtM,0.1710227272727273,2014-03-27 03:23:30,True,True

2014-03-27T22:59:46,"Ugh. Before I even clicked on this trailer, I knew for a fact that the comment section was going to be littered with, ""Oh look a fictional story."" How original.  For the, dare I say depressed, atheist trolls limping around the Christian side of YouTube. (Not to say all atheists are trolls. Or maybe I am saying that judging by the comment section. You decide.):  Heaven is someplace unimaginable. God said we would never be able to even slightly picture what it's like. That means, with the brains we have now, we won't ever be able to understand why He even created the world to begin with. We won't know why He created Lucifer, or why He created a man who would just go to hell anyways. There's a much deeper meaning behind it, one that is simply not understandable. Like an ant trying to understand a human. It's impossible. If heaven is beyond our imagination, that means the logic of creationism is also. So why are we trying to disprove something that is way over our heads in the first place. It's sort of funny, and sad when I see an atheist on YouTube or wherever attempting to explain why Christianity doesn't match up with *human logic* or science. They just don't see the point. It's not supposed to. We are only supposed to believe what He gives us. When atheists say Jesus is a lie and explain why, Satan laughs them. He thinks it's hilarious, that they are actually buying into his schemes. Personally, Creationism seems way more rational than Atheism just because It boggles my mind that this random spinning rock in the middle of no where, inhabited by beautiful creatures and thousands upon thousands of unexplainable phenomenon, was not handcrafted by someone amazing.   If Christianity is a religion claiming God created the entire earth, then atheists, please don't use science or human logic to disprove it. Because of 2 reasons that *90% of Atheists do not understand:*   1. We don't STOP at the limit of science. We KEEP GOING. Please get this through your head. :P  2. We don't believe the human brain is smarter than a God who created the earth. We don't think everything can be explained. Can you create an entire world full of living and breathing creatures? No? Then guess what, we aren't going to believe that you know more than God. This goes for when atheists say things like, ""God is not real because why would someone who is so loving and caring send people to hell yadda yadda yadda my logic makes more sense than God because I am a human and I know everything about the universe.""  I'll end this with one of my favorite quotes.  ""If I go into a shop and see all the nicely finished wheels, gears, pinions, springs of a *watch* lying spread out on a bench, then later find them put together exactly and working in unison to move the hands across a dial and show the passage of time, do I believe that these pieces have been flung together by blind chance? Certainly not. I believe somebody with *thought* and plan and power has been there.

I do know that if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved and go to heaven. (Romans 10:9) You see, Jesus suffered a lot of pain. He died on the cross. In reply Jesus declared,""I tell you the truth no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born again."" If you want to go to heaven say this prayer-""Dear God, I come to you today and I come as a sinner. Have mercy one me. Let the old me die and the new me be born. Let me be dead to sin but alive in Christ. Jesus is Lord and you God ressurected him. Thank you for loving me Amen."" Now as believers, let's preach because Jesus said in Mark 16:15-""Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation."" Let's be unashamed because Jesus said-""If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him in his Fathers glory with the holy angels."" (Mark 8:38) If you do not know how to preach don't worry because the Holy Spirit will help you. Look up John 3:16, Romans 3:23, and Romans 10:9.

Or sleeping in their graves, unconscious?  Do not be deceived.   Daniel 12:2 And many of those who *sleep* in the dust of the earth shall awake,  Ecc 9:5 For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing  Psalm 146:4 His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.  Psalm 13:3 Consider and hear me, O Lord my God; Enlighten my eyes, Lest I sleep the sleep of death;  Psalm 6:5 For in death there is no remembrance of You; In the grave who will give You thanks?  Job 3:11-13 11 “Why did I not die at birth? Why did I not perish when I came from the womb? 12 Why did the knees receive  me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse? 13 For now I would have lain still and been quiet, I would  have been asleep; Then I would have been at rest.”   Job 10:18-22 18'Why then have You brought me out of the womb? Oh, that I had perished and no eye had seen me! 19 I would  have been as though I had not been. I would have been carried from the womb to the grave. 20 Are not my  days few? Cease! Leave me alone, that I may take a little comfort, 21 Before I go to the place from which I shall not  return, To the land of darkness and the shadow of death, 22 A land as dark as darkness itself, As the  shadow of death, without any order, Where even the light is like darkness.'""    Job 14:10-14 10 But man dies and is laid away; Indeed he breathes his last And where is he? 11 As water  disappears from the sea, And a river becomes parched and dries up, 12 So man lies down and does not rise.  Till the heavens are no more,* They will not awake Nor be roused from their sleep. 13 ""Oh, that You would  hide me in the grave, That You would conceal me until Your wrath is past, That You would appoint me a set  time, and remember me! 14 If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my hard service I will  wait, Till my change comes.   Psalm 30:9 9 ""What profit is there in my blood, When I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare  Your truth?  Psalm 88:9-12 9 My eye wastes away because of affliction. LORD, I have called daily upon You; I have stretched out my hands  to You. 10 Will You work wonders for the dead? Shall the dead arise and praise You? Selah. 11 Shall  Your loving kindness be declared in the grave? Or Your faithfulness in the place of destruction? 12  Shall Your wonders be known in the dark? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?   Psalm 115:17-18 17 The dead do not praise the LORD, Nor any who go down into silence. 18 But we will bless the LORD  From this time forth and forevermore. Praise the LORD!  Ecclesiastes 3:18-21 18 I said in my heart, “Concerning the condition of the sons of men, God tests them, that they may see that they  themselves are like animals.” 19 For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing  befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath; man has no advantage over  animals, for all is vanity. 20 All go to one place: all are from the dust, and all return to dust. 21 Who knows the  spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, which goes down to the earth?    Ecclesiastes 9:10 10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going.  Isaiah 38:12, 17-19 12 My life span is gone, Taken from me like a shepherd's tent; I have cut off my life like a weaver. He cuts me off  from the loom; From day until night You make an end of me.  13 I have considered until morning — Like a lion, So He breaks all my bones; From day until night You make an  end of me. ….  17 Indeed it was for my own peace That I had great bitterness; But You have lovingly delivered my soul from the  pit of corruption, For You have cast all my sins behind Your back. 18 For Sheol cannot thank You, Death  cannot praise You; Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your truth. 19 The living, the living  man, he shall praise You, As I do this day; The father shall make known Your truth to the children. ",2,0,droptozro,N-ewaCVARtM,0.012244062244062241,2014-03-31 09:44:47,True,True

But you have to believe. And you must look beyond what you believe in order to establish a deeper faith. That is what true faith is all about.

I laughed about a dozen times and just couldn't handle it anymore I had to scroll up and voice my opinion. So here it goes: DEAR IGNORANT NARROW MINDED HARD HEADED IDIOTS,                                     Whether you believe in science or no God at all WHO CARES NO ONE ASKED YOUR OPINION it is respected but don't come to a RELIGIOUS VIDEO and bash people's beliefs. The lack of common sense some people have is ridiculous. God forbid religious people bashed on science there would be hell to pay. Am I right or am I wrong? Please someone tell me. Just because you don't believe in God doesn't mean there isn't one. People didn't believe that the earth was round. And look how stupid they looked afterwards. Science, is yes, important and helpful. But it is flawed in its nature. There are infinite things that science can't explain that a faith in God does. I was just in church this morning. It was fantastic. I""m a fully confirmed Catholic and it is awesome. But there a people with opinions out there that I have an incredible amount of respect for because that doesn't mean they aren't nice people. Why can't people have the decency to keep such negative comments to themselves? Just stop it already! Leave people be! People have a deep faith in God and this movie has a beautiful story to tell that is important to Christians. So everyone CALM DOWN STFU AND KEEP YOUR NEGATIVE COMMENTS TO YOURSELF. Like I said its stupid to comment on a video like this if you don't believe. Just go away. Shoo! No one wants you here. You don't see Christians contradicting and bashing on science.

He is suffering from fever and from what I gather is heavy sedation. He NEVER is clinically dead. Yet later, he tells his parents that he went to heaven and saw God and Jesus and Mary (whom was kneeling by God - a tid bit Mr. Burpo added after many questions by Catholics) and Angels with wings and Swords for the Devil/Lucifer and his Grandfather and unborn Sister and on goes the child's imagination embellished by the Father whom was a struggling preacher before his book of fiction caught fire. They took a child's tale and ran with it. Bingo! Jackpot!  And now a movie.  Congratulations Mr. Burpo. You hit the mother load, at the gullibility of others.

Honestly, it's enough to make you wonder as to why they clicked on the video and commented in the first place. My views: If you believe in God, Christ, Heaven, Hell, the whole 9 yards, then great. If not, that's cool. Whatever you believe is what you CHOOSE to believe. There's two ways of looking at the universe: 1. The signs and wonders to prove and justify your belief in God. 2. The science and natural happenings to disprove the existence of and justify your non-belief in God.  Which ever you pick is completely your decision. I understand that looking at what the bible says to be true could be taken as ""coincidence"" or just plain false; this is why God, and the concept of God is completely a matter of faith: You have to chose whether or not you'll believe. Besides, in the end, when we all die, we'll see who was right and who was wrong.

Jesus tells us, the love of money is the root cause of all evils. I was worried when they wrote a book and it become the best selling book. They should have stop there the parents of Colton Burpo. Now Hollywood realized they can make good money out of this God's story as it will galvanized the Christian world in money making business of Hollywood move. See how Satan can play a trick on our mind, how he can control God's property for his own goal, I don't believe God took this little boy in Heaven for the parents to make a move or this boy make good money in this story.  I pray the father and mother of this boy will have the courage to stop at this point what they are doing in God's story of this child. This is how Satan adulterates in all kind of God's own stories by creating a counter fit to it.  If any thing good should come out of this, writing a book and film making business is that the parent along with there son will use this money for glorifying God's work here on earth, probably by helping disadvantage kids in their needs world wide. For me any thing to do God I worry when God's story become our own story and use it for personal fame and financial gain I know you might say look big preachers are doing worst than this in making God's story in money making machines, I agree with this saying and they are the one who lead people in deception of greed and false promises Jesus never give us in the first place when He called us , He never told us He will make us famous and rich in to this world but He said He will forgive our sins and cleans us from our iniquities and will unite us with our Heavenly Father and our life will be the extension of His Kingdome if we give back every thing He gives us.

Professor : Is GOD good ?  Student : Sure.  Professor: Is GOD all powerful ?  Student : Yes.  Professor: My brother died of cancer even though he prayed to GOD to heal him. Most of us would attempt to help others who are ill. But GOD didn’t. How is this GOD good then? Hmm?  (Student was silent.)  Professor: You can’t answer, can you ? Let’s start again, young fella. Is GOD good?  Student : Yes.  Professor: Is satan good ?  Student : No.  Professor: Where does satan come from ?  Student : From … GOD …  Professor: That’s right. Tell me son, is there evil in this world?  Student : Yes.  Professor: Evil is everywhere, isn’t it ? And GOD did make everything. Correct?  Student : Yes.  Professor: So who created evil ?  (Student did not answer.)  Professor: Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don’t they?  Student : Yes, sir.  Professor: So, who created them ?  (Student had no answer.)  Professor: Science says you have 5 Senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Tell me, son, have you ever seen GOD?  Student : No, sir.  Professor: Tell us if you have ever heard your GOD?  Student : No , sir.  Professor: Have you ever felt your GOD, tasted your GOD, smelt your GOD? Have you ever had any sensory perception of GOD for that matter?  Student : No, sir. I’m afraid I haven’t.  Professor: Yet you still believe in Him?  Student : Yes.  Professor : According to Empirical, Testable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says your GOD doesn’t exist. What do you say to that, son?  Student : Nothing. I only have my faith.  Professor: Yes, faith. And that is the problem Science has.  Student : Professor, is there such a thing as heat?  Professor: Yes.  Student : And is there such a thing as cold?  Professor: Yes.  Student : No, sir. There isn’t.  (The lecture theater became very quiet with this turn of events.)  Student : Sir, you can have lots of heat, even more heat, superheat, mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat. But we don’t have anything called cold. We can hit 458 degrees below zero which is no heat, but we can’t go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.  (There was pin-drop silence in the lecture theater.)  Student : What about darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as darkness?  Professor: Yes. What is night if there isn’t darkness?  Student : You’re wrong again, sir. Darkness is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light. But if you have no light constantly, you have nothing and its called darkness, isn’t it? In reality, darkness isn’t. If it is, well you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn’t you?  Professor: So what is the point you are making, young man ?  Student : Sir, my point is your philosophical premise is flawed.  Professor: Flawed ? Can you explain how?  Student : Sir, you are working on the premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a good GOD and a bad GOD. You are viewing the concept of GOD as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, Science can’t even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing.  Death is not the opposite of life: just the absence of it. Now tell me, Professor, do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?  Professor: If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do.  Student : Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?  (The Professor shook his head with a smile, beginning to realize where the argument was going.)  Student : Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor. Are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you not a scientist but a preacher?  (The class was in uproar.)  Student : Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the Professor’s brain?  (The class broke out into laughter. )  Student : Is there anyone here who has ever heard the Professor’s brain, felt it, touched or smelt it? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established Rules of Empirical, Stable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says that you have no brain, sir. With all due respect, sir, how do we then trust your lectures, sir?  (The room was silent. The Professor stared at the student, his face unfathomable.)  Professor: I guess you’ll have to take them on faith, son.  Student : That is it sir … Exactly !

Lewis, closed the Bible 3/4 of the way through and logic (not feelings) dictated that it would take MORE faith to NOT believe than TO BELIEVE.  And when I truly believed my eyes were opened, that emptiness was filled and I for one haven't even entertained the thought of looking back...why in the world would I?  I was indeed blind...but oh man...now I can truly see:)  I pray that anyone who is searching to fill that emptiness...take a break---go away from all the noise/distractions/bells/whistles/temptations that this world bombards us with every second of every day---be still for more than 5 min, breath deeply and from the bottom of your very being---not the actor that you or the world has created, but from the core of YOUR very being ask God to reveal himself to you and you will see that He has been there all along.",0,0,Scott L.

2014-04-19T15:20:39,"""It was a reflection of God's mercy that He came to earth and lived among us, and died to cover our sins. It is a reflection of God's mercy that He forgives our sins rather than making us pay for them. God does not send anyone to hell. People choose that for themselves. It is a natural consequence of turning away from God. If a person chooses to go away froom God during this life, how could they expect to spend eternity close to God. If you never spend any time or attention getting to know someone, how can you expect to have a close relationship with them. You can't. In order to spend eternity close to God, you have to expend time and effort and energy here and now getting to know Him. If you don't, that is your choice, not God's. God will keep offering opportunities for each of us to use this life to get to be close to Him so that we can be close to Him for eternity (be in heaven), but He respects us enough to honor our own choices. If we choose to be away from Him in this life, then we have chosen that for our eternity as well, and being far away from God in the next life is the basic definition of hell. People choose that for themselves. God will always try to help us to a better choice, but He will not force Himself on anyone, in this life or the next. We are responsible for our own eternities. If someone ends up in hell, it has nothing whatsoever to do with revenge. It has to do with the personal responsibility for choices of that individual. Try not to be one of them.   Anyone at all can have heaven if they choose it. Spiritual life is a different matter from physical life. That is just a fact. You can see physical things with your physical eyes. Spiritual life is made up of spirit. By nature, it cannot be seen with physical eyes, but when you develop spiritual knowledge, then you do have spiritual ""eyes to see"" with. Just like you can't understand physics until you study basic arithmetic, you can't expect to understand how to ""see heaven"" spiritually until you have the basics of belief down in spiritual life. For those who do have spiritual life and knowlege, there are those who have ""seen"" heaven. St. Paul talks about that. But you have to know the basics before you can comprehend spiritual ""physcis,"" so to speak.""",0,0,The Top 20,N-ewaCVARtM,0.07201646090534977,2014-04-19 15:20:39,False,True

That is why religiously branded schools are so abhorrent.  Not enough to have churches to take your children along to, you have to interfere with a rational education as well!  Not enough to  physically abuse children, you also have to mentally abuse them with archaic superstitious nonsense. And Christians can no longer be tolerated as harmless idiots.  Their historic inability to engage with science and their connections with the right wing economic rationalist side of politics means that they fly the flag for climate change denial.  So while you Christians may be offended that sane people don’t accept your warped view of the world I get offended whenever I see that symbol of human sacrifice thrown in my face over and over and over again.

If I recall correctly, he and Christ were approaching the gates and when they opened, she immediately came running out to pull him into a fierce hug-- and she couldn't stop hugging him during nearly his entire visit. Call me a sap, but I was pretty much crying when I heard that. It's just such a surreal thing to picture, but so heartwarming and hopeful. Too irresistibly sweet a thought for me to just ignore... I couldn't help but imagine what they might've looked like, my two older siblings and younger one, whom I never got the chance to meet.

2014-04-27T20:14:37,"Wow, what an incredible story!  Literally; it's a story with no credibility. Yeah, that whole ""out of body, seeing things"" experience? What, you don't think any scientists said, ""That's really abnormal and intriguing; we should investigate!""? Ehahahahayeah... Turns out when an object is placed in a spot where the patient shouldn't be able to see it, but in a perfect position to be spotted by someone floating above the scene, near death omniscience suddenly becomes about as accurate as guessing what was up there.  But what about all the other stuff he ""couldn't have known""? Well let's see; is it really more likely that there is a beautiful alternate dimension (or actually just plain the sky if we want to base Christianity on what the bible actually indicates, but nobody wants that; that would make the theory not only falsifiable, but just plain false!) for which the means necessary to be transported there fly in the face of everything we understand about the connection between consciousness and the physical brain. OR is it more likely that either through straight-up feeding the kid information, unintentional signalling, or a mixture of both, the kid knew this stuff because the parents, who OBVIOUSLY would have a lot to gain by lying, gave it to him? Probably the first one.  Oh, and about the stuff he couldn't have known in particular, chances are one of the recommended videos to your right is the interview with this kid. In it, he mentions the amazing story where the dad never taught him where Jesus's ""holes"" were, but the kid somehow knew they were in his hands and feet. Bullshit, even religious ""medical experts"" will tell you the Romans didn't put the nails in people's hands. Too many muscles and cartilage and such, not enough bone; gravity would rip the nails out; if Jesus was even a real person who got crucified, they were through his wrists. Maybe the dad isn't lying when he says he never told the kid about the crucifixion, but this family was clearly religious beforehand, and at very least the dad is an idiot for thinking the kid has gone whatever number of years in the Christian culture without seeing and being influenced by at least one faulty image of Jesus on the cross. Actually, I guess that's a pretty damn likely explanation that the dad has cement for brains if he was blown away by the kid telling him the granddad was called pop-pop. I've heard some weird names, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that that was NOT the grandfather's first name. A grandfather who has been addressed as pop-pop, what are the odds?  And you know what? You're right, if I'm an atheist and I don't like this stuff, I shouldn't click on it. Unfortunately, only the first premise is true. I don't hate this stuff. Well maybe I do on the most superficial level, but I do get enjoyment out of watching these. You see I have a rather grim sense of humor, and if you're on the outside of the freak-show looking in, religion is some of the best dark comedy to ever exist.  Knock knock. Who's there? No one, but because the vast majority of people seem to be under the impression that there is someone there, manipulators and exploitationists and charlatans are going to keep getting rich by selling this brain-dead schlock to the masses, and most of them are going to go to their graves, sometimes prematurely due to their delusion, without ever knowing how badly they were robbed.",0,0,Annie Trinity,N-ewaCVARtM,0.08893217893217893,2014-04-27 20:14:37,False,True

As for belief in ""Hell"", that's laughable because Hell is even MORE pagan than Christmas is.  Hell is a combination of Niflheim and Tartarus with the name of the Norse goddess, Hel, slapped on it.  There is nothing in the Bible about it.  The Jewish people, whose religion the Christians *stole* and warped into a monstrosity, don't even believe in it.

I couldn't stop reading, and at times I felt my heart beating so fast that I had to put the book down and let my eyes release some tears. At 12 years of age my parents and I had a car accident. I survived the car accident but God decided to take mom and dad with him. The book describes a lot of things and in some part I had tears of joy to know EXACTLY what my loving mother and dear father are now experiencing in Heaven.  I've always been a believer and my faith just got stronger after I read the book.   One night when I was living in California I was told something in my sleep but I couldn't figure out the meaning of what I had seen. It was kinda bothering me not knowing what I had seen.  While reading the book at a starbucks in Denver, Colorado something in the book described what I was told and what I had seen in my sleep. I had to put the book down...I was shaking and my eyes just filled up with tears. What Colton described  in his book while he was in Heaven everything was matching EXACTLY what I had seen in my sleep. I was truly shaking.  I just can't wait for that day to come… what he revealed me in my sleep, and truly I can't wait to see my mother and father again.  You know, we are all children of God. He loves us ALL, it doesn't matter who YOU are. He loves us ALL unconditionally. He created us with his love, to be loved, to spread love.

We did not just slap ""based on a true story"" onto it and expect people to believe. We are giving people a chance to think about a situation like this, giving them a chance to truly see whether they like the idea of a god or if they don't believe. So, yes you have the choice whether to like this movie or not. You also have a right to have your freedom of speech. However, this does not give you the right to completely try and rip apart a Christian with your rudely stated logic. Simply stated, Christians also try to tear down a view from atheists. This does not mean all Christians are bad, nor are all atheists are bad. The fact that several atheists felt the need to comment with foul language, and rude statements, without thinking through a simple question a Christian could give an actual logical answer to, sickens me. This is a movie based on a child's belief of what he saw, as he is not forcing you to believe. You do not have to belittle him just because you felt the need to rudely share your opinion. To those of you who politely stated your belief, left it simply, and then left it alone, are the ones who are deserving of anyone's respect. Yelling at a Christian for something you do not believe in won't change their faith, so there is no reason for you to try and belittle them. Same as for Christians. Some do try to force their belief on others, those are the ones who do not necessarily need your respect. People are different, and that's what it comes down to. You don't have to use the will of freedom of speech to be a completely rude and irrational person. Use it to simply state your polite opinion and leave it at that. It's that simple.

Remember, Satan does know what Heaven looks like. AND the real Colton says he saw God's face.

And be at peace among yourselves. 14Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. 15See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. 16Rejoice evermore. 17Pray without ceasing. 18In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 19Quench not the Spirit. 20Despise not prophesyings. 21Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. 22Abstain from all appearance of evil. 23And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 24Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. 25Brethren, pray for us. 26Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. 27I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. 28The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

It would be nice if humans could determine such, but only God determines (for which I am glad) who goes into Heaven and since He has not returned, none has. There are references of those who have gone, such as Moses and Elijah.  Satan uses a mixture of truth and lies to get his way, and sad to say this is one such.

This is not a hate/anger message, hence I did not press the dislike button. The truth is in the Bible and many people will soon see the light (I know many will refuse to believe as well).  Eccl 9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.  The dead speaking to the living is spiritualism. This has been recorded in the Bible with King Saul speaking to a dead Samuel through the Witch of Endor.

I would love to watch this movie not for religion purposes, but just for the happiness this kid gives to the people around him. Everyone brings up religion all the time, but lots of people are different, everyone is different, we believe in different things and we judge each other or disrespect what others think or why they think it. I believe that something happens after we die, we can't just go into nothingness for eternity, I do believe in a Heaven, and I do believe in a Hell, and a in between, I don't have to believe in a God to think that. This is what the movie is about, it's just about a young boy, who saw things, and how he uses that to change the lives of everyone around him. So what if the family does believe in God, that doesn't mean it qualifies as a ""Christian Movie"" though it is rated as one. I would love to watch any Christian Movie because other people's beliefs is fascinating to me, as long as they aren't shoving it down my throat because I don't believe in the same thing as them.

Surely cant be all just oops it all just happened we came from dust and all that. If that were the case we would see people growing in our yards everyday. So I mean its all interesting But I wish this would have happened to a more of a non religious family...  I Just think this was to framed and molded for there benefit.

2014-07-29T21:50:59,"I'll like to state my opinion, I hope no one tries to lash me or anything, because I respect everyone's opinion. I believe in God and I believe that he sent his only son to die in the cross for our sins. I recently got baptized, because ever since I accepted Jesus into my life, my life has changed for the best. First of all to me GOD is not a religion, he's a relationship. All these fights about this and that and divisions of different ""Religions"" when there in only one God. People like to stretch the bible and make up their own versions of what happened and they just completely misinterpret the whole thing. That is exactly what the Devil wants you to think. He wants to confuse you and for you to see God as this big monster. I pray that God illuminates people's minds and that God places strong people in their lives to help them realize the truth and for them to stop with such negative comments towards something that is so amazing, which is the love of Jesus Christ.   One thing people need to know is that God does not force anyone to invite him into their lives. He loves you either way. You have the right to live your life the way you want too and invite him if you want. If you don't invite him, then that is your problem not Gods. The reason there is so many bad things happening in the world and the innocent are dying is because people don't let God in, and God is not going to enter any where if he's not accepted. There are a lot of people world wide who worship objects, they find a weird image in a tree and they start worshiping that tree, or they worship other God's and saints, and the evil just lurks around and bad, crazy stuff happens and God punishes. If you don't let God in, the Devil will be wondering around lives and the lives of the innocent. That is why there are people out there sharing the gossip world wide and into those tribes who worship other Gods. Its up to them if they want to let God in, if not then the evil will continue doing his thing in people's lives.  One very good example is violence in schools, God is not even allowed to be talked about or mentioned in schools, so this is why so many crazy unthinkable things happen in schools and people are to stubborn to realize it. The bible was written so people around the world can know what happened, for those to share the word of God to those who don't know. BTW this earth was created so perfectly. Think about the seasons, how flowers bloom etc.. and it does not make sense to me that it was created the way scientist say it was. lol monkeys to humans...  Some people just have the wrong idea about who God is, hes all about love, but if you don't believe and want to live your life all crazy with lies, fornication, adultery, living your life getting high and drunk, hurting others, being greedy and thinking yourself better then others and all that bad stuff, your life ain't going to go very good.  God is such a merciful God that he has hope and faith in non believers, that's why he has not come yet and taking those who are worthy to be in heaven, but there will be a time when people will realize that all this is not BS and he will deny you.  Matthew 10:33 But everyone who denies me here on earth, I will also deny before my Father in heaven.

But does that mean we can't state ours? God is real. There are soo many questions in this world that makes people not believe, and makes people doubt his existence even more. But the majority of these questions that you guys are asking is in the bible, and half of you probably never went to church. (Not saying it's true just an assumption)  If you actually went to church and experienced what I've experienced, then there would be no questions about it. Those silly questions that people ask wouldn't matter.  Because YOU know he's real and YOU know what it's like to have a true relationship with God, and shouldn't care what other people think.  Now to answer some of those questions people are wondering. To those people who grew up in different countries and may not know God,  he always gives those people an opportunity for them to believe.  It's their choice whether to take it or not. There is so much more that I could get into, but my main point in this was to say that all these people that say God isn't real, has never had an experience or close relationship with God.

2014-08-12T19:37:52,"@Rebecca Ehalt, Oh dear child...... If you are not a believer of God, then why DO you watch this video? And let me answer your question about why God does not reveal himself to you:). And please be mature about this, Your lack of respect for others belief shows how ignorant you are. I completely respect your beliefs, but i have no respect on how you treat those who do believe.   As you do not know, God reveals himself to those who SEEK him (meaning with all their hearts and pure intentions of meeting him because you have faith) , and he will seek YOU. (as stated in the bible).  You have no pure good intentions at ALL to see/feel his presence. . has revealed himself to me, and may i say he is real. It is more of a spiritual feeling rather than hard core ""evidence"" which you will never understand.   If God revealed himself to the whole world, then no one would have a true meaning of believing in God. They would believe because they only ""see"". He wants to see those who will follow him because they BELIEVE that he is real. We walk by faith, not by sight which you MUST understand :).    and you say just because we were born in a christian family, which is the reason we believe in him. 1.) explain those who were born in athiest family yet chose to turn to God?? I have MANY friends who are religious tho their family to not believe in God. Also i have a friend to is muslim yet her family in christian :). What must you say about that??  You know the story of Noahs ark i see? :) Good darling, just as you are reacting with hate, laughing at what we believe/preach , you are reacting the EXACT same way as the people in the story who noah tried to warn :). One day you will understand.... i am not shoving my belief in your face if that is what you believe, i am simply defending my belief (and behalf of christians) belief.   ps. Id rather live my life believing in God and dying to find out he does not exist, than live my life as if he didnt and die to find out he lives.

2014-08-14T17:46:57,"  Hello, everyone! ^u^ Usually I try my best to keep from the youtube comments...but I had to let you all know just how amazing, beautiful, and wonderful each of you are-whether you're christian or not, all of you are making me nervous just being around you- that's how amazing you are! ^.^ I'm not sure if I'll make it to heaven or not, and lately I've been praying that no matter if I make it there or not I'll never grow to hate someone so precious to me, Jesus! :-D I've been praying that I'll never grow to resent those who do make it there without me, because to me they're special in my heart. I heard stories of how people who didn't get to heaven, hated those that did, and Jesus even more...but I pray with all my might, that that'll not be the case! But that when I see that they made it, I hope I'll have peace and be overjoyed :-) To everyone, atheists and christians alike...I wanted to share my knowledge with you!  To the christians, I've learned the hard way that you must learn the word for yourself, that's wonderful if people inspired you to learn more about the bible, and encourage you to read scriptures-but those people may not always be around to remind you or inspire you, people may not always be around to pray with you everday-or those people may even forget themselves that they need to pray. You have so many resources around you that there's hardly any more excuses left for not taking action to read it yourself except for if you haven't heard of the lord, or if you lose those resources...and even if you do lose the resources you once had, look above! :-D God is still there smiling and looking down on you, if you ask for even the smallest scripture, he'd be overjoyed and would give you a thousand more  scriptures than what you asked for! Think, if God has been with you for all these years, even when you haven't paid him a lot of attention, surely he won't leave now that you've brought him into your life again! Without learning the word, your chances of heaven start to grow slim, because then you are open to all kinds of deception. Have you ever heard of 'The Sinners Prayer'? After a lot of shows on TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) near the end, after they say the prayer, the preacher will say ""If you just  said that prayer, and believe just got born again, get into a good bible-based church, make Jesus your lord and savior and he'll take you places you've never been!"" or something along those lines, and this is true! :-) Except, what they forget to mention is that you must be BAPTISED as well as believing in him and making him your lord and savior.   A little, one-sentence scripture a day is enough!  Think on that scripture, and pray about it! If somebody says or does sommething that you don't think is right, look it up in the topical bible (Just google search it  and it should pop right up! :-D) and see for yourself! Look up youtube videos about God to get you more rooted in the lord, but first learn the bible well- or else you may even be decieved then!   If people who don't believe in god know more about the bible than you do, and you know at least some of those people are using the word for the wrong reasons, then it's time to make a change! If non-believers are pulling out all kinds of scriptures out of books in the bible that you haven't even heard of, in an ARGUMENT, you must at least want to try to do something to change that! Please, it'll save your life! :') I want to see each and everyone of you succeed.  You start with any book you want, Genesis or Revelation, just try it and be diligent! Remember that standing up for God proves just how fearfully and wonderfully made you truly are, and it will be rewarded!  But if you only do this when you feel up for it, in a time when you feel as if you're forced to stand up for him, this isn't enough. Do it everyday! Do it with a hairflip, then walk away with your head high, and if you got on heels clack em' real hard against the ground when you walk away- and if someone looks at you funny, smile and show them allllll of your teeth! XD (But if I showed them MY chipped yellow teeth, they might start running u.u) be proud when you stand up for the lord and it won't go unnoticed!  Live the word you read, and use it as your weapon! Christians, you are beautiful, and special, and all kinds of amazing to me :-D I admire you all for how brave and confident you each are, I wish so badly that each of you have a place in heaven!   and to non-believers, the ones who research the bible, and to the people who don't...your just as wonderful too! You guys are amazing, and breathtaking, and beautiful, you guys are shining so bright that I'm about to pass out from thinking about the beauty you all have! But please, give Jesus a try...he won't dissapoint. I wish I can tell you that your journey with him will be easy, I want to ensure you that there won't be nights where you'll almost lose your hope in him, but the truth is there will be countless times where your faith will be tested so much to the point where it feels as if it's hanging on a thread, it may take years but he will reward you in ubelieveable ways just for hanging on so long, this I can ensure. Keep in mind that your faith doesn't have to be hanging on a string unless you make it out to be this way, if you stay deeply rooted in the word-your troubles will roll right off your shoulder and the light will come shining through again.   But...I can't force you to do anything though, just know that if you ever change your mind, all the resources you need are there. Please, for all those wanting to know about Christ...or are at all any type of curious, keep in mind that you are gradually running out of time to this :-( I'm so sorry about this urgency, I really am... but you can't put this off any longer. But, take these words to heart.... I would love to see you all in heaven, oh boy! :D In heaven I would give you all the biggest and tightest hug I've ever given! Know that your amazing, and incredible. Know that so many people admire each and every single one of you, and to these people you are treasured dearly. But your biggest admirer of them all,   is Jesus Christ.  Repent from your sins daily and have Jesus living inside you. Read the word and live it, act on what God wants you to do, and most importantly. In all things have love, not a forced love, or a reluctant love, but a genuine love for the world and all people in it, save the highest place in your life for Jesus. Remember that Jesus is the only way to God, and that all good things come from him. ",0,0,Francis Bonnefoy,N-ewaCVARtM,0.2757034676244234,2014-08-14 17:46:57,False,False

2014-08-17T01:16:37,"Take, Christianity, Islam and Mormonism for instance. Obviously all 3 can’t be right, because God wouldn’t contradict himself.  Someone has a false book here. First let’s look at what Islam says concerning Christianity, Surah 5:68 in the Quran commands you to read the Torah(The old Testament). God did say that Satan is unoriginal and tries to mimic him. Then we have in plain language when you read the old testament that God punished Abrahams decedents from the servant girl Hagar side(Ishmael), because Abraham slept with the servant girl instead and bore her a child, Ishmael, instead of his wife. He didn’t have faith that his wife, Sarah, would bare him a child so God punished the descendents of Ishmael-Genesis 16:11-12 says decedents of Ishmael will be like a wild donkey and his hand will be against every man. God did love Ishamael but because of Abraham’s sin Ishmael’s descendants were cursed. 2 Corinthians11:14 says Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light!  Quoting from the Hadith of Bukari, 9.111: MUHAMMAD SAID, ""THE ANGEL CAUGHT ME AND PRESSED ME SO HARD THAT I COULD NOT BEAR IT ANY MORE."" DOES THAT SOUND LIKE AN ANGEL TO YOU? satan always pretend he is God that is why HE IS CALLED THE GREAT DECEIVER The God of the Bible and the God of the Quran act nothing a like. Galatians 1:8: But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!

For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.   You must be born again in order to have a real spiritual relationship with Jesus. It is not a 'religion' it is about living a lifestyle the best you can, that will glorify & please The Lord. Not even the Christian who attends church every Sunday and prays so many times a day is perfect. We were born into sin. God is perfect, so there was a barrier between us and God. Jesus died on the cross so we are cleansed & forgiven for our sins from yesterday, today and tomorrow. Meaning that when we accept Jesus & invite him into out hearts, we can have a real relationship with God, pursue the wonderful plans he has for each of our lives & go on to live with him in heaven for eternity. God, His son jesus, & the Holy Spirit are 3 in one. When we have jesus in our hearts his Holy Spirit helps us to make wise choices & discerns what is right and wrong. Sure we still get things wrong, as we are not perfect, but God is an unconditional loving Father, who always welcomes us to come home to him no matter what.

It's like a huge argument between atheists and Christians, with a couple of neutral people on the side. I'd like to be one of the neutrals. Personally, I have no idea if this story is true. Yes, I believe in God, the bible, and heaven. No, I don't know if you can go to heaven and come back or who will go to heaven or not. Those are all my opinions. It's my choice what I believe. Reading some of the ruder things in the comments, a few thoughts were going through my head. One was ""Why do the Christians tell nonbelievers that they're going to a not-so-pleasant place?"" Out of curiosity, I ask how you got this information. I don't think it's in the scriptures, but if it is, please tell me. I don't pretend to know who will and who will not go to heaven, but I'm fairly certain it depends on a person's actions throughout life, not a comment on a YouTube video. But that's just my opinion. Another thought, ""Why do the atheists insist on being angry at the Christians for believing in heavenly beings?"" If you think science has not proven it and therefore it's not true, fine. It's not my place to tell you what you should believe or think. But why spit upon those who do? I think (emphasis on think) most of you live in America. Correct me if I'm wrong. In America, it specifically says in the constitution that we have freedom of religion. You can choose what to believe, which I'm thankful for. But you don't have to force your beliefs on anyone else. Finally, the last big thought, ""Why post negative things?"" I'll take a line from Bambi and say if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. It's like (and this is a terrible comparison) DC fans posting on a Marvel video just to complain about Marvel and what they think is stupid. Marvel fans do the same to DC videos, I'm sure. Why can't you just let others enjoy what they enjoy without saying negative or hurtful things? Lastly, thanks to all those who commented simply to talk about the video. I really liked those comments, because some were even from atheists and Christians alike who just had an opinion of the movie, not just about the truthfulness of the story. I might see the movie myself, because it looks interesting. (Fyi, I don't mean to complain.

Religious people saying that everyone can have whatever belief they want but somehow manage to point out that atheist are still very blind and are making a big mistake. Atheist saying the same thing about religious people. These people bugs me the most. Don’t try to stop people arguing when you are still being rude towards those who think different. I live in Sweden (sry if my english is crap and I can’t spell) and everyone I meet are always supporting and curious of other peoples view on life.

2018-03-22T00:22:47,"GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, I m in seventh heaven over this week s film.  SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Heaven can wait, Greg. Let s get on with the review.  GREG: Our story opens on Pastor Todd Burpo (Greg Kinnear) who is working odd jobs trying to make enough income to take care of his family. His income as the pastor to a small flock in Imperial, Nebraska is not covering their expenses. He lives a simple life filled with softball games, friends, and his family consisting of his wife Sonja (Kelly Reilly) and two small children including four-year-old Colton (Connor Corum). Things are going pretty well when something dreadful happens. It s any parent s worst nightmare.  SCOTT: Colton has a ruptured appendix and has emergency surgery performed on him. He survives, but it was a close call. Maybe a bit too close. In the weeks and months that follow the surgery, Colton begins revealing memories of visiting heaven while he was unconscious. At first, Todd has trouble coming to grips with these recollections, and then when word gets out the entire congregation becomes stirred up.  GREG: The young man who plays Colton is just adorable as the four-year-old who reflects the innocence of youth. There is a scene where Colton is visiting a sick man in the hospital and Colton sees a child suffering from chemotherapy treatments. He walks over to the child and holds her hand and reassures her that nobody s going to hurt her. Scott, this movie is based upon the real events documented in the book by the same name. The subtitle of the book is A Little Boy s Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and Back. The fact, however, is that this is the story of Todd Burpo s experiences and trials after revealing his son s visions to the world. This makes Burpo the hero of the story. Greg Kinnear does a good job of making Burpo look like an everyman with the world on his shoulders.  SCOTT: Greg, I enjoyed the concept of this movie, as I m fascinated by near-death occurrences and all the common experiences that people worldwide have shared when they ve come close to dying or have died and come back. I read the book and found it to be a powerful account of a young boy s claim that he visited heaven. I say powerful because if you believe the father s account, there are three compelling pieces of evidence supporting the boy s story: (1) the boy s knowledge of his unborn sister, (2) the boy s knowledge of the grandfather he never met, and (3) the boy s confirmation of the image of Jesus as portrayed by a Lithuanian girl who also had a near-death experience. But the movie-makers decided that this story alone wasn t powerful enough to carry the movie. So they decided to make the father the hero and to manufacture a good deal of anguish in the poor man. He s depicted as a hothead who kicks furniture and who struggles with the idea that his son has met Jesus. None of this happens in the book, and for good reason - it s a silly notion for the father, a Christian pastor, to disbelieve his son s story that heaven exists. The movie also fabricates a terrible crisis in the church over the veracity and meaning of the boy s story. These embellishments rang false for me.  GREG: I didn t read the book and you ve pretty much summed up my problems with the story. It wasn t about the boy, it was about the father. This tack follows a typical Christian pattern wherein the hero of the story (Pastor Burpo) reveals his belief in miracles and the faithful (despite their beliefs) reject him. This creates a martyr of the pastor and he must face ridicule and the wrath of his followers. But through his own faith and tenacity he convinces the un-faithful to follow and believe. It is a story that seems familiar to me from reading the Bible.  SCOTT: There really are no villains in this story, but there are oppositional forces that our hero, Todd, encounters. There is a woman on the church board who wants to replace Todd. There is a psychotherapist who preaches a scientific explanation to Todd when he instead needs spiritual guidance. There are also his own inner demons and difficult circumstances, including dire family finances and numerous personal health setbacks. Again, many of the struggles that Todd faces do not appear in the book, which wisely centers on the sheer power of Colton s story rather than on reactions to the story. So we have a movie that tells a powerful story of a visit to heaven but strangely focuses on everyone getting wigged out by the story.  GREG: Id have to differ with you there, Scott. The congregation of Burpos church are the villains. Or should I say opposition . There is no evil intent here. But they create the hardship that Burpo must work against. Truly, if there were no oppositional force in the movie, there would be little story. I think we ve seen this story before. Do you remember the classic film Oh, God? In that film John Denver plays a man who talks to God and the entire world including family and friends turn against him. It s only his faith that sees him through the challenge. There are a couple of classic Christian film tropes in store for the viewer. Burpo makes a trip to a college professor who is an expert in out of body experiences. She is a non-believer and has recently lost her husband to cancer and is bitter and hates God for it. We saw this same character played to the extreme in God s Not Dead.  SCOTT: Heaven is For Real is an unconventional movie that puts all its emotional eggs in a single spiritual basket, namely, the afterlife experience of a young boy that seems to defy belief. The movie makes the unfortunate decision to showcase the father s turbulent journey rather than the child s, and the result is a film that doesn t ring true to me. There are good performances by the entire cast, and as you note, Greg, Connor Corum is adorable as the young Colton. But I cannot give this movie more than 2 Reels out of 5. Greg Kinnear does a fine job in his role as Todd, but the hero journey lacks both heft and believability. I found Todd to be one of the least spiritual people I ve seen in the movies, and yet he is a Christian pastor. Toward the end, he and his wife finally see the light, but why it takes 90 minutes to see such a bright light is beyond me. I can only give Todd 2 Heroes out of 5. While I wouldn t call any of the characters villains per se, there were oppositional forces that force Todd to squirm, to suffer, and to change. One could argue that this movie is a nice story of a family that prevails over serious financial, health, and spiritual setbacks. Still, some of these obstacles, such as the congregation that freaks out, seem forced and fabricated. For that reason, I can only give this film 2 Villains out of 5. Movie: Hero: Villain:   GREG: Scott, you pretty much read my mind. Heaven is for Real is a movie that preaches to the choir. If you re a believer you ll believe. If you re a doubting Thomas, you won t be convinced. I give the film 2 out of 5 Reels. The hero is a simple confection of a good man in a difficult situation. Other films have dealt with this topic in a more convincing fashion with a more humble and sympathetic hero. I give Burpo just 2 out of 5 Heroes. And the congregation as the villains were predictable and flat. They rate just 2 Villains out of 5. Heaven is for Real won t get many revisits.

2018-10-12T03:50:22,"Hi everyone. Long long before this movie came out I was a teenager in the early 1980s. My parents brought me into a old antique store on the Oregon coast. I was bored ""like always with anything old"" so ..I looked around so no one was watching me I pulled out a glass in a box wrapped in a news paper printed printed in 1912. I read a article that a woman was in sugury and that her spirit had lived out of her body....and was hovering over head watching the sugouns performing surgery on her. I was shocked....WOW I am looking around ...no one saw me so quickly wrapped the news paper around the glass and put it back into the box. I said to my self.....this is REAL! not made up! people in that erra were MUCH more honest then today and the stories of ghost were real! since then I have joined a few near death experience groups interviewed no less then 50 members and the stories they say are astounding! not every NDE is the same but the detailed are incredible. Small example: when a person dies and has a NDE the silver cord...cord of life is attached from the body to the soul. It glistens and it needs to stay attacked both to the body and soul in order to return back to the body. If its severed...the soul can never come back to the body. The soul also travels at t he speed of thought...lighting quick. I could go into more detail but the stories I have read are astounding. Ohhh.and try and do the right thing! you ma see you self in a ""life review"" of your life in the afterlife doing thing that are painful to others.",0,0,tech nician,N-ewaCVARtM,0.1692460317460317,2018-10-12 03:50:22,False,False
2018-10-14T02:17:56,"Y'all from the movie of Heaven is for real, the movie is great, but the lady who said ""Heaven and Hell are just concepts to frighten people"" How can you, you who said that Heaven and Hell are just concepts say that they are just concepts, they are not concepts they are real. Y'all people don't know the truth, y'all are just trying to make a show in church. Let me the tell y'all a few things. #1.Heaven and Hell are NOT concepts to frighten people, Heaven and Hell exist, but those 2 Kingdoms cannot be seen just like Jesus Christ cannot be seen. #2. The Reverend or pastor of the Church in the beginning of the movie, you said that your not sure if Heaven is real, how can you, preaching the Word of God not believe in Heaven. #3. The Rapture of the bridegroom do y'all believe in that? (See the following scriptures that talk about the Rapture: 1Thessalonians 4:17, 1Thessalonians 4:16, 1 Corinthians 15:52, Luke 17:34-37, 1 Corinthians 15:51-53, Matthew 24:31, Matthew 25: 1- 46 and Luke 17:35-37) because I do and it will happen before Jesus Christ comes riding on the clouds of Heaven #4. When the Reverend or pastor fell to the floor, wife Sonya Burpo of the Reverend or pastor, your not supposed to tell your friend ""that lady that said that Heaven and Hell are just concepts to frighten people, your not supposed to tell her sing Amazing Grace, NO! On the contrary your supposed to have the whole Church pray with faith for your husband, not sing Amazing Grace, Why you going to sing Amazing Grace for when your husband is on the floor with his back hurting? #5. If y'all don't seek for the Holy Spirit in y'all's Church, you should do so.  #6. Pastor/Reverend Todd Burpo, what does the story of the lion, bear, unicorn and Tiger have to do with the Word of God?  #7. in this movie your supposed to preach the Word of God  #8. In the hospital scene Todd Burpo, how can you being a Reverend or a pastor yell at God telling him ""Don't you take my son"", No! you're not supposed to get angry at God, get angry at the Devil he's the one who put the sickness in your son. Or you don't believe in Hell and the Devil who is in Hell? Just like there is such thing as Jesus Christ, there is such thing as the Devil. You supposed to remain in Faith Todd Burpo, not yell at God.

2020-05-10T06:14:56,"You guys do realize this is all completely made up right?   Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” he wrote on his own blog. “I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.  Don’t take my word for it, do a google search for yourself if you like. Believe in whatever you want to, but stop letting these people lie to you and profit off of your blind faith.",0,0,Handled Scandal,N-ewaCVARtM,0.014285714285714271,2020-05-10 06:14:56,False,False
