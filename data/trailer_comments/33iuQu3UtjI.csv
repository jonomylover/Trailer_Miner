That aside I do hope this isn't cut like a shitty bourne clone like the last Jackie Chan flick I saw. I mean I get that he's older now and perhaps can't do the same level of stunt work but he's still capable of doing some incredible stuff. You don't need to cut and shoot the movie like he's just learning how to do this 15 minutes before you shoot.,0,0,devilmikey00,33iuQu3UtjI,0.035416666666666666,2017-06-26 23:20:09,True,True

He can still pull off stunts, which is impressive considering his age, but he doesn't look like he's giving a lot of energy unlike all his other movies, whether they were good or bad. Also, I don't mind the old Taken style, straight-forward revenge plot, only if they use it in a good, fresh way. Also, the cinematography kinda looks bland and dull and the CGI isn't at all convincing. But that's just my opinion. I know it seems like I'm trashing this movie without having seen it and going into maybe too much detail into just a 2 minute long trailer for what is supposed to be a straight forward, fun action thriller, but I wanna stay optimistic because Jackie Chan is a legend.

2017-06-28T00:24:10,"I've commented this before on one of the Atomic Blonde trailers but I'll say it again. With two John Wick movies, Atomic Blonde, American Assassin and now The Foreigner, it seems as though Hollywood is giving us a lot of sleek looking, silent assassin movies starring big actors. Either they're starting a whole new unofficial genre like superhero/comic book movies, or all the studios behind each respective movie mentioned above are starting an Assassin Cinematic Universe. Now I know many of us are sick to death of connected universes but hear me out. What if they keep it unconfirmed? And in each movie, instead of obvious references to the other movies to keep them tied together, they drop subtle hints? Such as the gold coins that appear in the John Wick movies appearing in the other movies, or extras in the background talking about a man who killed three men in a bar with a pencil, the audio quietened down. Then, as people start to notice as the movies progress and start to post theories on the internet, as they do, start introducing bigger and more frequent references, like a file, which has John Wick or Charlize Theron's character in Atomic Blonde's name in small font size in the corner of a file. This is what connected universe's should be like. Instead of blatantly telling us what's coming next, they should keep us guessing. This would even fit with the tone of these movies and characters: dark, mysterious, subtle. The Pixar movies may all be connected. So might these suspiciously large amounts of assassin movies be.

First off, how many times has Gerry Adams came out and denied any role in any of the IRA groups that have existed since the early 1900s.  Also, the provisional IRA (along with all of the other Republican groups and even different factions of the IRA) is a secular and Marxist group. It is intellectually irresponsible to just making the whole of the Irish struggle for freedom a religious feud. Both Catholics and Prodys fought for freedom in 1798, 1866-1869, 1916, 1917-1923, the border wars, the Troubles, and in the New IRA. Wolfetone was a prod and he is the father of Irish Republicanism.   Do some reading, watch some documentaries, and actually do some research before you start saying stupid shit.",0,0,M.J.

Like many other comments have stated, I also grew up watching Jackie Chan's movies but most of them had comedic elements to them and always threw in a few laughs even at the most dramatic points.  This, however is going to be a very different kind of Jackie Chan movie, One I never thought they would even consider making and now I'm dying to see. He looks absolutely perfect for the role by keeping his emotions in check especially when you consider how content he always looks in his previous movies.
