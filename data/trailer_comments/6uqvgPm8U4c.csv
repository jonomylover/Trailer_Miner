Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers.

That's obviously going to be Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. So what if we discover, this world in which the beatles never happened was something that the original remaining members actually wished for because the trappings of fame and celebrity were just too much. They just wanted to live a normal life for the rest of their days. But at the same time they're wishing for this, this dude is wishing to be the next beatles. So it becomes this sort of Freaky Friday scenario. Where the dude got his wish to become one of the greatest artists to exist, but he slowly turns into somebody thinking he's better than he is. So he loses the girl, then realises how the music industry doesn't actually care about the artists or the music they make. And the movie becomes sort of about how, the beatles couldn't exist today, because the music industry would have too much influence over what they would sound like. (I.e Hey Jude becomes Hey Dude). So this man goes out to find the real beatles and they work to change things back to the way they were. Probably by playing Yesterday or something. And then he gets the girl, happy ending. But my point is this movie seems really silly but there could be a lot of really interesting themes. Like, what is influence vs plagiarism, or how giant record labels are soul sucking, and how fame changes people. So it could be really interesting. Although presumably in this world, John Lennon wasn't brutally assassinated and was just sort of, hit by a car instead or something. So I don't know how they're going to cover that subject in a way that doesn't feel tasteless. but we'll see.",0,0,Alex P,6uqvgPm8U4c,0.08878787878787879,2019-02-15 23:58:37,True,True

If they wouldn't exist, it would have been another ""beatles"" in the 60,s even 70,s that would have experimented with music. Therefore the whole film doesn't make sense and its gonna be full of ""funny"" gags and that's it.
