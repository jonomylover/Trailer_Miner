Wills friend who's daughter does not love him anymore needs the 'actor of love' (Amy)to help him get his daughter back therefore he can see the 'actors' also.  Wills other friend that is dying of a illness needs the 'actor' death to help him through his hard time so he can also see the 3 'actors'  Wills other friend also really wants to be a mom but believe she is to old to have one and has run out of time therefore she needs the 'actor' time to help her believe she can still be a mom. Therefore she can see the 'actors' aswell.  So nobody else could see love,death,time in the movie just the people who need them desperately such as will and his friends. We know this because at the end of the movie when will has came out of his depression and no longer need the help of love,time,death, he can see them all on a bridge when he is with his girlfriend but the girlfriend can not see them, will watches them disappear as he no longer needs there help.",1,0,P R,isQ5Ycie73U,0.05902777777777776,2017-04-10 21:43:47,False,False

2017-05-06T16:57:38,"""You have to keep breaking your heart until opens."" - Rumi  I think the reason people dislike the movie so much is because they do not understand it. The idea is that there's a pure beauty in pain and having the opportunity to experience love. The awkwardness in the film represents the different levels and view points, reasoning, to love.   My ex told me that I didn't know what love was. I remember looking back on our good times and realizing all of the moments I had fallen in love with him. I felt really sad about our break up and then this movie came to mind and I remember thinking, ""No, I know exactly what love is. You're not ready for my love.  I'm not going to let you take this (the memory of feeling love)  from me."" At one point I started laughing while I was crying because it all made so much since. Though our relationship was over, I was so happy that I got to experience love, even if it was one sided, and I was thankful. it's like standing in the face of everything that's hurting you and saying thank you.",0,0,Yurrah Al-Hadi,isQ5Ycie73U,0.29285714285714287,2017-05-06 16:57:38,False,False
