JESUS is was a Jewish Rabbi. Jesus is the one who is fully human and fully God who died on the cross for the original sin of mankind and ressurected on the 3rd day by the Holy Spirit of God. Jesus is forever human and God. He permanently changed His form for us. No other religion gives you an exchange like that. Either Jesus paid the price for your and my sin or we pay for it ourselves. No religion can save you. All authority over demons and Lucifer was give to Jesus. If you are baptized in the Holy Spirit and call on the name of Jesus as your Savior then God's Spirit lives in you. Which means all authority over the powers of darkness are under your authority. But if you are ignorant of the Holy Spirit and your new identity in Christ then demons will laugh at your attempt to exorcise them from a home or a person. They can kill you. They can torment you. They wont take you seriously. It is a reality and unless you know your authority and how to speak and operate in that power then don't even attempt it. And dont get a priest or medium or demonologist. They dont know Jesus. They don't know spiritual warfare. Dont even watch this movie because they can and do put curses over all who see it willingly.

My theory is that it is pretty cheap to film at a college medical morgue as there is nobody there at night and the settings are scary, thus the genre. Of course this mixes the possession horror genre, which there must be hundreds... from really crappy B-films to big ones.
