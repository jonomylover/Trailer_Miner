The first movie was really toned down in that regard and i think they should go back to that instead of the whole weird undead cgi captain with an undead cgi crew.  They should rename this series Captain Sparrow- Zombie Pirate Killer.  You know what would be better than this is if Jack Sparrow went on a quest to find some ultimate treasure that had 7 map parts and each map part if either garded by a mythical beast or in some labyrinth or a complex  cleverpuzzle. The final piece of the map is like part of the crown jewels of england or someshit.

2016-10-03T06:18:57,"My thoughts: Javier Bardem is amazing actor, I am glad he was given a different look-he fits in with this franchise, but is not too similar to the skeletons, zombies, or Davey Jone's crew. With the time taken into making this film, along with the return of characters and those related, it is clear this film will have a good amount going on. Not simply a race to a fountain with no real super-natural force beside one big scene (the mermaids) and a magic sword/ship. This is going to be ""death in his wake"" and battle time, for one reason or another. Stronger acting, not the very mellow, stand in blackbeard we got in 4. Ghosts, how do you stop them, hmmmm? The mood is also far more the tone of 1, 2, and 3. In conclusion, from this, I believe this franchised has worked to learn, instead of simply hoping for another hit.

Realistically, many people will pay to see it, but that's just because they loved the first film and over-optimistically hope for a return to form, which will probably never happen. You'll get terrible reviews and you'll try again every five years, further embarrassing Disney and shitting all over the first film. It's seriously difficult to enjoy the first film knowing it's part of the same series as three (and probably now four) utter pieces of shit. Just use your budget to make a great original film. You'll probably get the same amount of money either way, but this way you'll have integrity. If you absolutely must  turn this series into James Bond, just understand why everyone loves the first film. It's not because of its action, its fantasy, its deep and complex characters, or its many deep and complex subplots. It's simply because it's loads of fun. When you try to make a POTC film driven by those former elements, you epically fail. Please stop trying to be like Star Wars.",2,7,Mike Ock,1xo3af_6_Jk,0.06261904761904763,2016-10-03 14:12:18,True,True

And I then think, OH this isn't a monsterous attack, This is William coming to rescue his son. And as the music plays in a hauntingly similar fashion to davey jones theme, the figure walks down the steps and the look on that kids face, as though hes seeing someone he never expected to see.... and then bam the sword into the sparrow flyer... I was waiting for williams face to show behind it. But NO! For a split second we see what appears to be wills father bootstrape bill, and what looks like the sea life growth on his face returned.

In fact this movie is like all the movies we've seen before. First movie Jack went into sea port, dead crew of the black pearl come to him and have beef with him. Second movie, Jack is being chased by Davy Jones. Third movie, Jack is being chased by Davy Jones AND the other guy ... whatever his name was from the British Empire.

Unless you believe you can't, then you'll vote for one of those two, and everyone loses. I know most people do not want either of them but believe they have to choose. When in reality, Jill Stein could be president. If people actually tried. Unfortunately and predictably, feeling backed into a corner, Americans will choose Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Seriously? :( You're so distracted that it seems you now care more about being entertained than you care for yourself and other people. WW3 seems plausible sometime in the near future.

2016-10-04T16:56:34,"Hey Disney, here is a short list of things that I would like to see in a Pirates Of the Caribean movie.  1)A Sea Serpent. Retro scary cool monster.  2) Atlantis. Heck, you made up a whole language for the place in that animated movie. Might as well use it for atlantean characters. Adds world building atmosphere, internally advertises your properties, and the internet will eat up the ""Oh, is Captain Jack in the same continuity as a Disney Cartoon?"" stuff.  3) Tritons. No, not Ariel's dad. Look it up then make it up. You can make up a warrior race of fish people. Aqua Klingons. Have fun with that.  4)Grace O'mally references. When we historically have a Pirate Queen, it may be cool to have her in the film (she died in the 1600s, so add some magic to that), have a kickass grand daughter carrying on the family name, or have Jack hunt the treasure she left behind.  5) Search for the treasure of Sinbad. The movie writes itself. Get Deltoro to direct and he will stuff the film with Harrihousen monsters.  6)The likelihood of you going to japan is high for film novelty, so here are two things. A) Did you know off the northern coast of Japan there is a pyramid-like staircase leading deep underwater? Make up something with that. B) Did you know that eating Japanese mermaids can either turn you immortal or into a butt-ugly berserk monster? Story kinda writes itself. Free advertising if you have Jack Sparrow fighting a ninja.  7) Odyssey waters. You got Circi, Sirens, greek myth stuff all over the place, Add some Harpies that can fly and swarm a pirate ship and maybe have the treasure be the tomb of Poseidon or something else to make up. The last sword of Hephestus? Hm? Just remeber in the rich myth to have plenty of contemporary Mediterranean people and pirates.  ((Jeeze, at this point just an animated series sounds better))  8) Baron Munchausen. Does not matter how he got there, but forcing Jack Sparrow to be someone else's straight man would be a great way to cap the series as he competes with the master of ridiculous legendary feats",0,0,butchdeadlift10,1xo3af_6_Jk,0.2058045977011494,2016-10-04 16:56:34,True,True

When captain Jack Sparrow lost command of the pearl and how he made the deal with Davy Jones to raise it from the depths after it's apparent destruction. How they crew found the cursed gold. That's¬†1 if not 2¬†movies right there. Don't go for 3 it will just drag on too long if you do that.

2016-10-05T05:38:46,"Maybe this will suck, maybe it won't. But it will have great music.   The problem is that they went from someone like Barbossa (charisma, likeable), Davy Jones (Tragic yet awesome) with cursed crew and his impressive kraken, to Blackbeard with a couple of Zombies and a regular crew. The fourth film was always going to feel like a big downgrade.   Ghosts are somewhat generic but if they can capture the menace of Salazar like they did with Jones it will go a long way to being a decent movie.

Glad to see its coming, though I have to say they are going darker -¬†that I don't like about it - but a veteran movie go-er I know that things are not always as they seem. Sure hope its not in the theme of the fourth one. I didn't enjoy that one as I did the others. Then again going completely back to the fun loving elements of the first three would in itself be a mistake. I just hold great hopes that it ends the series on the great note it began on. So So many films series start out great but only get darker and darker and ultimately ruin - for me at least - what¬†was once so great about them. I still hold out hope that Will and Elizabeth¬†return one last time, too. Then again, my hopes for this film are no greater than those - and the fears that I hold -¬†for the next HTTYD film.

Javier Bardem has excellent screen presence but why do the producers think its ghosts that people want! We all a want a traditional swashbuckling adventure with no ghostly  or over magical stuff, one of the reasons the first was so great. The ghosts were the weak element of the first and they just kept elaborating on it in the sequels! Pirates and battles against the empire or other real pirates, captured and thrown into castles etc. Hollywood producers get me so angry with amount bad story lines they think we want!!! I bet they pay their best mates to write such rubbish, where if you made an open forum for writers and paid for the best it would be so much better!!! The odd marvel film has been good, but DC stuff written so badly, and so many other ¬£150 million dollar movies as well.

2017-06-24T08:28:26,"So i recently watched some movies like Baywach, newest fast and furious, pirates of the caribbean and  some others, and i made my opinion on this years movies. Everything is not that bad there are jokes and parts when thing gets serious. But fn special effects in every single movie this year is just crap (green screen, cgi, ect.).

2020-06-08T14:12:23,"Oleg Paz   I wish we could have an Apollo Creed origin movie, and rise to champion before Rocky. That would be dope        jin kim   Ruiz vs aj is just rocky 1 and 2 flipped        xx1j   @1:37 can't hold me back anymore        Phil Thaddle   Should have listened to him Apollo, Rocky ended up retiring you        JoeJoeRunya   I always loved the link that Rocky and Apollo had.. that link that only true respectful rivals know and understand        Zach H.   Best thing about Apollo is he wasn‚Äôt really a Villain at all. Just a champion that wanted his respect. He was written and played very realistically unlike the antagonists in the rest of the movies.        Satai80   ""I Won, But I Didn't Beat Him!"" Captain America probably thought same thing after Thanos went to dust. :)        Nater K   ""You realize if we use this humiliation tactic, you're setting yourself up as the bad guy.""  ""Well yeah. The movie's not called ""Creed II.""""        Nater K   1:31 Can't hold it back anymore...        Clark Kent   Apollo was in his Vegeta feelings        White Male Murican   Jon Jones talking about Reyes.        Victor Bl√ºd   Some call what Apollo did as an act of vain pride but I see it as it was a test of his honor. He could have sat back and never let Rocky get another chance at the title and just rode on it till he retired but he didn't. His honor as a fighter wouldn't let him. He knew that he didn't deserve that title unless he proved he could beat anyone who came to take it.       Supperdude9  I just look at the Rocky series with a set of, I don't know, awe, and sad eyes.  Sure, it's inspirational, sure it's a good movie series, and it deserved its awards.  It's just hard for me to ignore what else happened in the movies.    Too bad his trainer failed him in the third movie, having him go soft by setting up lollipop fights so he could retain his title.  Too bad his people failed him by Rocky 5 and he lost his fortune.  Rocky Balboa had the potential.  It was never utilized by the proper people.  When you get right down to it, going by stats, Rocky's time in the boxing limelight would have been... uneventful.  He has a weak record in the indies.  He got beat by Apollo in Apollo/Rocky 1.  Barely won Apollo/Rocky 2.  Had lollipop opponents to keep his title.  Got beat by Clubber.  Beat Clubber.  Beat Drago.  Fell from grace, and couldn't compete in the ring after that for the title for a few years.  Got another shot against Dixon, lost that.  Think about that.  He had THREE notable professional wins.  THREE.  Two were title wins, and the third was essentially for revenge on Drago.    Rocky's tirade against Mickey was justified.  If he had his shot, had been in his prime since day one, imagine the title reigns.  Imagine how far he could have gone.  If he had the proper people around him, he would have been the absolute best.  People around him kept failing him.  The ""love"" he gets from the crowd is solely because he is a novelty.  An underdog.  Not because he's the best, but because he still has that sideshow tag Apollo put on him since Rocky 1.  If Apollo did not have pride, in Rocky 1 and in this scene, Rocky would have forever been a mere footnote in the indie scene.  Apollo could not let go of his investments for his big fight.  Apollo could not let go of his pride and that cost him his title.     If Apollo did not do any of that, maybe he wouldn't have taken on Drago.  Maybe he wouldn't have died in the ring.    As much as the Rocky series is heralded for being about triumph, it's also full of tragedy.  Of how so much of Rocky is wasted, and how everyone made bad decisions.        sanjay bakshi   Never fight a southpaw        Rolf Bernerske   Duke was never wrong        rikkierikkie   FF'in legendairy        mitch taylor   2 great actors        Tim Morton   You gotta respect Apollo for not just taking the decision win and be happy with it, he wanted a definitive outcome. In most cases it's the loser in a decision match that calls for a rematch but here it is Apollo who is willing to prove something.        Dave   Man, Apollo's look and facial features kinda remind me of Etika.        Vincent Martinez   And you never will....They call that the Crooked Draw of Boxing...ü§£ü§î.....üå™Ô∏è        Tom Van Riper   Always loved this scene, a rare bright spot in a bad movie. Shows what a stand up guy Apollo was.        BigSalProductions   Wouldn't he be better off fighting against a real contender and winning to prove he really was the better fighter against Balboa???        wawa Elias   √ârik Morales should've took this advice after the 1st pacquioa fight        tim conway   Rocky always respected Apollo.
