2019-08-13T11:32:23,"Spoilers ahead:    The word ""masterpiece"" gets used a lot these days to the point that its lost its meaning. People would even call blockbuster popcorn flicks a ""masterpiece"" these days. That being said, I gave this movie a watch out of curiosity after I saw a few people deem it a ""masterpiece"". This movie is literally like the Japanese movie Shoplifters, only instead of shoplifting to survive, this family leeches off of other people to survive. The story starts with the premise that this family leeches off of other people to survive down to even stealing wifi from other people. Koreans do a great job of making unlikeable characters as protagonists since I felt the same dislike I had towards the protagonists of this movie towards the protagonists of The Handmaiden. Unlike Shoplifters, this movie made each member of the parasitic family dislikeable to the point that you wish death upon them. The daughter of the parasitic family (Ki-jeong) in particular was so unlikeable to the point that I wished death upon her as I watched the movie. Hell,she was acting and speaking like a drunk would for most of the movie and even spoke like a drunkard as she was getting stabbed by the deranged husband of the housekeeper and bleeding to death. I liked the social commentary this movie had by showing the divide of class between the rich and the poor. It also had its moments of black comedy humor here and there. I would have been angry if these characters got a happy ening but I'm glad its a grim and bleak ending we got at the end. Altho, how Ki-Woo survived getting hit with a stone twice on the head is beyond me. I'm no neurosurgeon but how he is functioning as a normal human being despite that and avoided braindamage makes me question if this is possible. Overall, I enjoyed the movie despite its initial predictability of the family members replacing the servants of the rich family and enjoying a life of leisure the house of this rich family had to offer as they worked for them. For me, things started taking a turn when it was revealed that the former housekeeper was leeching off of this rich family as well and had a husband held up in the bunker whom she fed regularly. Thats when my interest peeked since I was about to give up on this movie when I saw these unlikeable characters enjoy a luxurious lifestyle as they leeched off the rich family. It would have been nice if the protagonists were more likeable and if this rich family they leech off were mean or abusive instead of the nice family they were potrayed to be in the movie since that would have given us a chance to root for the former despite the parasitic family's sins. Either way, the film takes a bit to get interesting and to get out of the bowels of predictablility but despite that, I wouldn't call it a ""masterpiece"" like most reviewers claim it to be. I have never seen a movie made by Bong Joon-ho so I'm completely unbiased since most people will call anything made by their favorite directos a ""masterpiece"" these days. Watch this movie only if you have patience and can withstand unlikeable characters.",2,0,Sebastian Joseph,SEUXfv87Wpk,0.13041383219954647,2019-08-13 11:32:23,True,True

2020-02-12T00:02:48,"South Korean film ""PARASITE"" directed by Bong Joon Ho won an Oscar.   Screenwriter Han Ji won has also won an Oscar.   And two more Oscar's, one for best film and one for best foreign film.   Before that he was awarded the Golden Palm in Cannes and the Golden Globe.   In Cannes, the audience applauded for eight minutes after the screening.   Critics are thrilled with this movie.   What is so good about this movie that it has received so many awards?     I was unable to find any artistic value in this much-rewarded film.   Black comedy, as movie critics have called it, is utterly infantile and silly.   The boring story of a poor family has nothing dramatic in it.   When a forced and imposed action begins to lose its meaning, the director suddenly decides to make a banal thriller.   But when he fails to do so, he tries to pull himself off by effectively ending the movie with delusional and bloody horror, where we are not sure who will kill anyone and where there is no logic as to why anyone is killing.   Everything is torn and disconnected. No compactness in the story. There is no depth. Everything is neurotic thrown in and without adequate symbolism.   In the absence of the director‚Äôs intelligence and ingenuity, he jumps from topic to topic and it seems desperate.   Bizarre details, for example, when a wealthy rich dog eats a barbecue that is stabbed in the back of a murdered person, appear to be freer than so much blood that unnecessarily flickers on all sides.     The director admitted that Hitchcock was his role model.     He better not have stated that.   The characters are one-dimensional, superficial, stereotypical, recognizable and without any personal character trait.   Everything on them is disciplined wrong.   Soldier washed.   The acting is except for the Asian beauty of the cast, especially the younger ones, the bad, the   unremarkable , the unconvincing, the empty and the dilettante.   The actors did not play the show, they did not carry the shop, but instead dragged everyone to their side, trying to dominate somehow, as they constantly clashed in the director's effort to make the film more tense and scary.   But, there is no Hitchcock virtuosity, dizziness, tension and plot.   It's all a sad improvisation of the movie ""Psycho"".   Movie lovers who like to follow the details of the film, the little things that give the film its taste and aroma, which makes Hitchcock a famous world director, can find a large number of scenes that are so stupid, illogical and unnatural that it hurts the intelligence of the average cinematic viewer.     Even the famous South Korean, perfect and modern technique couldn't help this desperately bad movie.   So why did the film win so many awards?   Attempts by paid critics to glorify film as a great critique of contemporary capitalism have been completely missed.   On the contrary, the film is an apology of modern, tycoon capitalism, because it portrays the poor people as psychopaths, greedy, selfish, deceitful, and savage, insatiable, disingenuous people who cannot control themselves, who are corrupt, sneaky, deceitful, and unpredictable, so they cannot, when they would get rich, to be so nice, polished, weighed, nurtured, polite, cultural and stupid as a class that manages capital.   The scene when the family, left alone in the mansion, begins to devour food and intoxication, the way the daughter drank whiskey, is best told of that poor, unlived parasite who needs to remain parasites in society because they are incapable of carrying the burden of capital on their backs.   Transformation of a polite, educated and well-groomed maid of the Park family, who, like many rich men, is allergic to peaches, into an angry and savage beast, unable to control and unable, though it has been so long in the house of rich people, to find a compromise with those who have taken her place in the house, already forcing them, blackmailing them that she will show a film from sell phone to the landlord Park, is the best proof that these parasites of society deserve to live at the bottom of society, in the banjo of Seoul, because they are immoral, incapable , vindictive, jealous, maniacal and hidden killers, who want to express their social complexes to successful people, who create new values ‚Äã‚Äãin society.   The father of the family kills Mr. Park right out of this social Darwinism.   Poverty stinks!   Mrs. Park's little son sniffs at it and tells everyone, but she won't admit it openly, when Father Kim, after a terrible flood, drives to get supplies for a picnic and when she has to open the window because of the stench of poverty.   Poverty stinks!   On the other hand, the Park family is naive, Mrs. Park's nonsense is so interpreted, the word naive a few times by some of the poor Kim's family members is straightforward, they are good, noble, orderly, clean, family, disciplined, trusted, not deserved by members of the lower , a poor society who, at the end of the film, make a horrendous revolutionary massacre, dreaming that they will one day buy that haunted rich house and settle down to live in it, just in the spite of those ruined, naive families.   Is this a critique of modern capitalism?   Isn't this an ode to neoliberal capitalism in decline?   The highlight of the movie, which won so many awards, is the imitation of Mother Kim as she caricatures television presenters from fraternal North Korea who talk with delight and adoration about the North Korean dictator, ridiculing the North Korean regime, and quarreling with its leader.   That's a recommendation to US officials to prepare an Oscar for this bad movie.   The only thing that is striking about the movie is those legendary Seoul banjo, stinky basements in downtown Seoul, where thousands of families live today, in impossible living conditions, and where it is best to bring on biblical flood where will take all that parasitic scum, stench and slum into a sewer.   Odor poverty.   It stinks!   Parasites should be dusted and exterminated as dangerous insects.   There is a scene at the beginning of the movie when they are really questioned in their suture.   Poverty stinks!   That's what rich people and politicians think.    That is the message of this political film.",0,0,Dusan Kostic,SEUXfv87Wpk,0.008672299922299927,2020-02-12 00:02:48,False,False
