In the Bible, when He comes, He will be like a thief in the night (no one will know when He's coming). And those who are saved will go to heaven first and escape the years and years of suffering. Plagues, countless murders, famines, natural disasters. Yes that's happening now but it will be 1000 times worse. During those years, we will still have an opportunity to be saved. But our faith in God will be tested beyond the limits. It will only be too late when Jesus comes back, not as a Lamb but as a King, along with His angels to give the final judgment to all the human race. Every knee will bow and every tongue will praise Him. Doesn't matter at that time if you have salvation or not. Every single living creature will bow. There will be those who will live in the light and those who will be thrown into the darkness forever. This movie may not be entirely based on the Bible but as far this trailer goes, where else can you get a story line like this from? No where else except the Bible.  God loves eveyone. And He doesn't want anyone to perish. He wants us to be ready so that we don't get left behind cause those who aren't ready, the things that are coming will be horrific.

2014-09-03T12:53:37,"Sad but non-believers are a slaves of darkness, b/c your mind is limited to your 5 senses. Every contact that human’s have ever had in this world comes to you through his five senses.  We have gained no knowledge outside of them.  So it comes through sense perception. This is why people who have only contacted the physical through the senses will deny the existence of God, because he cannot find Him in the material world. The carnal minded person interests are the things which are confined to the five senses which are unstable, vanishing and fleeting pleasures in this world. Sometimes we think we know, and then it’s nothing at all like what we thought. Most people want to deal with a God that they can control, we don’t want him to infringe upon certain things in our life that we don’t want to deal with.  So consequently, we take what should be spiritual and we make it religion. You are blinded by the power of Satan and he's successful at keeping you in the dark. You act as if you have the power to change things as you daily witness how dark this world is becoming, and you have no power to do a thing about it, none, but yet you believe you know more than the Lord. You've never created a World and you're not certain of anything including your own life.  So your wannabe belief is powerless. The devil is a deceiver. Folks that write this kind of mess are acting like the Lord is sitting in Heaven wringing his hands about this, how deceived are your ego's. You're a carnal minded person, basically dead because your mind is cut off from God. There are two kinds of knowledge in the world, one is the knowledge that we teach in schools.  The other is knowledge that comes from God and it’s spiritual knowledge.  Carnal people only can relate to what he can see or learned and has obtained through the five senses; Christians have revelation from God which is spiritual that rises above the 5 senses so we are not limited.  The grave yard is filled with potential untapped power, dormant ability, hidden strength, used might, reserved power and unused success.  I find that people become victims of mental and historical conditioning. What we see, and what ever we hear are small things compared to what we think, because what we think interprets what we see and what we hear. Because you are limited to your 5 senses or the physical world, you never reach your destiny in this life, or your purpose. You never connect to the real source of your power which is used by faith, so you are powerless to change this world or make a difference in it. The greatest tragedy in life is not death, but it is life without purpose.  It is more dangerous to be alive and not know why then to be dead and not know life. Never under estimate the power of the mind, because you are a slave to whatever your mind is a slave to. You become conditioned to a way of thinking that you find yourself adjusting to the slavery of your thoughts, then your attitude begins to find comfort in oppression.  Sin is more than an act or a series of acts; it is a state or condition; it is that thought which lies behind and produces the acts. It blinds the understanding, corrupts the heart and alienates the mind from God. That's exactly why you are in the dark. Satan is also called the “power of darkness” and when we accept Christ we come out of darkness unto his light of wisdom. Darkness stands for ignorance; ignorance has ever been satan’s choice of weapon to keep people in bondage and unaware of his evil force in their life.  Not only has he bound them with ignorance, but he also has given them a ""fear"" of light so that they fight the truth (light force) that could set them free. (And Fear is the opposite of faith), Get Wisdom, Get Saved and Get real freedom. ",0,0,Kat,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.05760233918128655,2014-09-03 12:53:37,True,True

I find it really sad that people think that without belief in a god, they would run around killing and murdering, essentially proving that their religion provides no lasting moral system outside of faith, however I don't believe that people would behave in the way described in the left behind series. You would be surprised! All indications point to less religious societies being less violent than religious ones, and it is films like this that provide further evidence of religion losing every argument it tries to win all across the board. I can only assume that Nic Cage is trolling at a ten right now, but the movie seems serious, which would be humorous if it wasn't sad that many people believe that this is a realistic possibility that will occur some time in their life time.",0,0,Shillelaghs Music,GrXe8YDbzYs,-0.01685267857142857,2014-09-12 04:49:56,True,True

The most important thing to know is that this is based (not 100% accurate!) off the Second Coming of Christ, NOT the Rapture. Why is it the most important thing? My opinion is based off the idea that people constantly create falsified trails (concerning things they have little knowledge of) that only lead others astray. Whether you know Christ or not, simply know that the God that Christians serve is not only a living and loving God but also a Righteous judge (Psalm 7:11). Whatever we use as judgement cannot be final if we ourselves are not perfect (which most of us saying on a daily basis), so it wouldn't be plausible to compare God's judgement to our own.",0,0,Dani W.,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.19188596491228072,2014-09-12 04:49:59,True,True

2014-09-16T05:18:00,"      The Pretrib Rapture Jackpot!                by Bruce Rockwell       Attention, writers. You can make a fortune by promoting the pretrib rapture!      First, some background. As you know, pretrib began in Scotland in 1830. The earliest developers, including Edward Irving and John Darby, admitted that it was then a totally new view that had never been part of any church's theology.      They also admitted that it had suddenly sprung from only OT and NT ""types"" and ""symbols"" and not from any clear Bible statement!      As late as 1957, pretrib expert John Walvoord admitted in ""The Rapture Question"" (p. 148) that ""pretribulationism"" is NOT ""an explicit teaching of Scripture""!      Since the early 1900s pretrib has been sold by novelists like Sydney Watson (in 1913) and by Salem Kirban whose ""Left Behind""-type novel ""666"" came out in 1970 - the same year Hal Lindsey's ""The Late Great Planet Earth"" started breaking sales records.      The very first rapture novel titled ""Left Behind"" came from the joint pens of Peter and Patti Lalonde in mid-1995, resulting in some competitors being left behind.      The pretrib rapture view, which admittedly is only an ""inference"" and not ""explicit,"" rests basically on verses in John 14, I Thess. 4, and I Cor. 15, none of which have either a ""taken/left"" separation or exciting, nail-biting scenarios that can ""sell"" pretrib.      You have to go to Revelation's action-packed chapters instead. When you do, you discover they can be tied to end time details found basically in the Olivet Discourse.      As you know, pretribs believe in two stages; Stage 1 is the pretrib rapture which supposedly occurs several years before Stage 2 which is the posttrib second coming to earth.      Since the three ""rapture"" chapters listed above don't have any clear rapture-type separation between the ""righteous"" and the ""wicked,"" your best launching pad if you want to be a bestselling author is ""the one shall be taken, and the other left"" phrase in Matt. 24:40, 41 and Luke 17:34-36.      Trouble is, Dr. Walvoord and many other pretrib leaders declare that the ""one taken"" are the ""wicked"" taken in judgment while the ""righteous"" are left! But since the average pew-sitters don't seem to know this, you can easily convince them that the ""one taken"" is a sort of code for an any-moment pretrib rapture!      And the pew-sitters don't know that Walvoord etc. also teach that the same phrase is part of ""non-imminent"" Stage 2 which is posttrib (and not pretrib) and is on ""Jewish"" (and not ""Church"") ground!      In order to preserve and emphasize Stage 1 (the pretrib rapture), pretrib merchandisers in recent decades have been stretching forward various aspects found in Stage 2 and quietly applying them to Stage 1. Aspects include ""the day of the Lord,"" ""God's wrath,"" ""the taken/left phrase,"" ""the unknown day and hour,"" and Christ's coming ""as a thief"" (which is always tied to Armageddon and other posttrib events).      (For more on the above Google ""The Correct Answer to Who's Taken"" etc. on Joe Ortiz's blog of Apr. 12, 2010. Also Google ""Pretrib Rapture Stealth."")      Yes, I've told you how you can turn yourself into a bestselling, wealthy author.      But unfortunately you have some competition because Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have already become opportunists and made millions of dollars that are destined to be left behind!      For more on them and their partners, Google ""The 'Left Behind' Rupture,"" ""LaHaye's Temperament,"" ""Jerry Jenkins Apologizes for Being Seen Gambling in Casinos,"" ""Pretrib Rapture Diehards,"" ""Thomas Ice (Bloopers),"" ""Walvoord Melts Ice,"" ""Famous Rapture Watchers,"" ""Margaret Macdonald's Rapture Chart,"" ""Pretrib Rapture's Missing Lines,"" ""Roots of Warlike Christian Zionism,"" ""Evangelicals Use Occult Deception,"" ""Pretrib Rapture Secrecy,"" ""Letter from Mrs. Billy Graham,"" ""Pretrib Rapture Politics"" and ""Pretrib Rapture Dishonesty.""      In closing let me say that Jeremiah 17:11 warns that ""he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.""      And you can bet on this!

Christians are not perfect but we like to stand in judgment as if we are. The key thing to bring away from the sacrifice of Jesus is that the sacrifice was far greater than the sentence.  Because of Adam's willful disobedience to God's commandment we were all sentenced to spiritual death, cut off from God. Man was held prisoner by the Law.  The Law was there to show us that we cannot live by the Law. It is impossible to follow the Law in its entirety. Jesus came as the second Adam to show us a better way.  He gave us the covenant of grace.  Grace cannot be earned. It is unmerited, undeserved, and unlimited favor. Remember because of sin we were spiritually dead. What can a dead man do to earn grace? Absolutely nothing.  There is absolutely nothing that you have done or could ever do that was not forgiven by Jesus' sacrifice.  As for the movie,  this is just one man's interpretation of the end times.  The bottom line is that Jesus is returning.  When?  Only the Father knows. What I do know is that the Bible says that everyone will hear the Gospel and be given the chance to respond to it before the end will come.  I hope this movie portrays a loving Father and not a spiteful God. Remember though God is holy and cannot abide sin. God's judgment is not on His creation, it is on sin.

2014-09-20T06:05:24,"I didn't want to enter the conversation because of all the bashing I hear back and forth, but I have to. I think about this all the time. I think about how amazing it is going to be when Jesus Christ the risen savior comes back to get His bride - the Church body of faithful, authentic believing Christians, who don't just say they believe but actually live like it and live under the Righteousness of Christ. But I also think about all those who don't know Christ and how terrifying and horrible it will be. I shudder at the thought of being left behind. It is nothing to laugh at or argue against. If you hear nothing else people hear this:  Christians: STOP arguing with others and START LOVING THEM. STOP trying to prove or argue that you are right. You know what the truth is. If you believe God, then you have to believe in Jesus and the Holy Spirit. Let HIM change both non-believers, luke-warmers and YOURSELF. YOUR JOB, our job is focusing on being responsive to the Holy Spirit's work of continuous SANCTIFICATION in us, our STEWARDSHIP of everything God gives us, and our SERVICE to others. This is what true believers should look like. Don't believe me? Look it up Matthew 25 - read it. The parables of the Bridesmaids, the Stewards and the Sheep. At the end of each parable, read what it says.. and then BELIEVE GOD and DO it, or you will be no better off than the unbelievers. Be changed by Jesus' love not prompted to bicker with those who don't yet know the truth. Educate them. Serve them. Love them. SHARE THE GOOD NEWS. Glorify God with your lives, not yourselves. He IS Risen and He will come back. Be ready - and know that each one of us will be accountable for how we've treated others, the conditions of our hearts. We are accountable.   ANYONE who might watch this and think ""yeah right, that's stupid, Christians are whack"" I understand. It seems totally foolish to you. But it's true. I'm not speaking for the accuracy or the ""Christian"" morality/theology of this movie since I haven't seen it yet, but one day rapture WILL happen and there will be people left behind and people who suffer and die because of people disappearing like this (as far as I know based on what the Bible says). I AM a Christian and I don't hate you or want bad things for you. I love what God loves. And God loves you. He gave His son Jesus in your place - because each of us is separated from a loving, perfect God - our heavenly father, because of sin. Our selfish choices to deny that He exists, that He's in charge, that He can do whatever He wants and He is always right because He made everything. We say ""No thanks God, I'll do it may way, your way is stupid. Denying His very existence is a good example of this. He sent Jesus to die the death we deserve and separated him from God the way we deserve to be, and will be if we don't respond to Him. If this doesn't make sense.. Keep an open mind.

Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness[a] is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. 4 He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.  The harvest is THE END.  Matthew 13:39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.  Matthew 24:29-31  Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

2014-09-23T06:19:11,"God is real. He is real. And for you the atheist who says that the Bible is based on horrific and false events, well, you weren't there so you can't say anything. The only reason the Bible is horrific is because a whole bunch of sinners are in there. And the events that took place aren't false. You people may think that we transcribed from monkeys and that scientific evidence that you supposedly found, but it is all just rubbish. God is real. And so is the Devil.  For you of those who are just thoroughly confused on why everyone is fighting, well listen to this.  God is real. He made the world. He sent his own Son to die on the cross for our sins and I'm sure most people wouldn't dare do that considering because they are selfish. The rapture is when the church, aka Christians, is carried by God's angels up into heaven. After that, the tribulation will probably start either after or a day after this happens.  The tribulation is a very sad time of which many people will die. So I advise you to go to a church that doesn't have a false preacher and repent. For God said that the time is at hand and He showed us in the new testament the signs of His coming.  Wars and rumors of wars. Parent against child. Child against parent. The fig tree at summer. Which basically means when summer is near. Things about Israel. And others. They are all planted in the Bible.  Yeah you may or may not argue with me. And yeah you may be angry and decide to start trouble. But guess what. When you yourself are either burning in the depths of hell never to be opened again because God would've already created a new world, (I'm being serious. I'm not joking about hell.), or in the great tribulation, your going to regret that this ever happened.  And you may say, fine ill wait, or some snarky remark.  YOU DONT WANT TO WAIT. YOU DONT WANT TO BE ON A PLANE THAT IS CRASHING BECAUSE MOTHERS ARE FREAKING OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR BABIES. OR THAT THE PILOT OR COPILOT IS MISSING.  and you also may think, so? Caps don't scare me.  Well, it will when your facing it.  And sure you might not die on a plane. But either way your going to die.  Unless you regain your sins in the great tribulation. That will be when groups of Christians are walking to a mountain to see the great battle between God and Satan.  You see, now before the rapture happens, Jesus is like a blanket over earth. And after the Christians and the Church have descended into heaven, the blanket will come off and literally, all hell will break loose.  God does love you. He gave you the choice to be a Christian or a sinner. Literally, no one in their life goes along without some type of connection from God. No one. And if you say that you have, well, that's because you missed it. although, there will be chances where you have to search yourself.  God gave us rules so we wouldn't be robotic and without mistakes.  If we were perfect we wouldn't be able to make mistakes. God isn't a dictator of our lives, he is a leader. The president of the whole entire world.  So the reason that we aren't perfect, but perfect in His eyes, is because you need mistakes in life. So then you can learn from them and get a better understanding.  And I'm pretty sure my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ will support me in this.  God wrote this through me. Thank you God.

To the atheists and christians arguing, I have the following to say: To the christians; most non-believers were once, at a time, believers. They most likely left the faith not because they are evil or hate God - they left it because they had an inquisitive mind which inspired them to seek the truth. I'd hate to burst your bubble, but most atheists probably know more about written scripture and the history behind said scripture than actual believers. Although you may not understand them, they most likely understand you - because at one point, they were in your shoes. They left the faith because of their open mind and because they applied reason. The bible is not, by most accounts, reasonable or logically sound. Religion is that way in general - that is why it is referred to as *""faith""* Please stop preaching your junk as if it were truth - just because you feel the ""holy spirit"" and just because a thousand year old book says something doesn't mean it's true. If that's the case, you better tell me why other major religions are not true - without violating your own logic.   To the atheists. It is foolish to assume there is no God. Sure there isn't a celestial overlord/mystical space wizard, BUT what we come to know as ""God"" is rather relative. God doesn't have to be some super magical dictator - God can be the very laws of physics themselves. Or even the engine which drives the potential multiverse. IT most likely exists, but it all depends on what you define IT to be. As Carl Sagan suggested, atheism is a bit foolish (yall are jumping the gun.).

Fellow Christians- We need to stop being so argumentative. We need to say what God puts on our hearts and then just pray about it and let God do the rest.

My thought: I assume you mean ""proven"" to be in a way that conforms to modern science. The problem with that is that modern science only accepts in its proofs phenomena that are in the material world. So far, science has not been able to manipulate or detect energy whose vibrations are higher than those in the material world.  God can be detected in things of the spirit world. There has been plenty of work on Earth to demonstrate that other levels of energy do exist, but science refuses to bother to carry out experiments on this level of energy that are dependable and repeatable. The movement to prove Near Death Experiments to involve the spirit world is picking up. Science will only say ""The Near Death Experience is a product of the physical brain. Period."" —even though none of THEIR conjectures can be proven. The old saying is ""Science progresses one funeral at a time."" That means people hang on to their old beliefs until they die. Those old scientists will be dying off and you will see proof that there IS a spirit world. And along will come more and more evidence of God that people will be able to accept. This may not result in proof that a ""Rapture"" will occur nor that the Bible is literally true. And so even THIS source of real proof will probably not be accepted by Christian Fundamentalists. That's the way it is so that's the way it must be. People know that our real home is in heaven, and they must believe and follow in the way that feels right to them.  Me? I believe in God, and that our souls are eternal and we come back again and again to become wiser in the ways of God.  Read Michael Newton, ""Journey of Souls,"" if you feel drawn to learning more! ",0,0,Wendalore65,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.20261479591836737,2014-09-29 16:00:43,False,True

2014-10-01T01:55:13,"vicky naz, re:  ""I, for instance, don't believe that I or any other human beings are descended from monkeys or apes or…""   I just want to say that I love and worship God, although I am not a Christian, and I revere God for creating the Universe, the Earth, and life on Earth, which was done very slowly, with tiny micro-organisms at first, developing and evolving over millions of years and winding up (so far) with humans, who can KNOW God, and who can also understand science and embrace evolution as the way that God developed life on Earth. Not just atheists understand evolution, is what I""m trying to say!  The wiser folks who have some connection with God can understand how science simply has learned how to detect and describe HOW God has manifested existence on Earth. Eventually, I think, science will figure out how to get in touch with the spirit world, and THEN we'll see!! mwahahahahaha!!!  As far as ""the end of the world"" is concerned, it will probably happen through global warming, and with long dragged out years of suffering b/c when people could have done something about it, they were arrogant and stupid and thought they knew better and did nothing. If religion doesn't help people see truth, I think it's lacking, seriously.  It's LIFE on Earth that is important, and that we treat each other with love. I don't think there is a hell, but if there is, I hope there is a special 'INTERNET HELL"" where people who tried to make others feel badly on the Internet have to go and sit there for eternity watching themselves and others be insulted by unknown beings over and over and over—beings and people that they had done no harm to…",0,0,Wendalore65,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.009491341991341998,2014-10-01 01:55:13,False,True

The New Covenant which Jesus of Nazareth brought forth from his virgin birth, to his sinless life, to his willingness to die on the cross with all the world's sins on his shoulders both at his death and those sins to come throughout time until his return, then his resurrection on the third day and ascendance into Heaven. Jesus preached nothing but love and peace, but just because you are a member of the human race doesn't give you the 'pass go' card into the Kingdom of Heaven. God cannot nor will not be in the presence of sin, thus the scripture, ""suffer the children and let them come unto me, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven""....and we also get a warning, ""broad is the path that leads to destruction and many there will be that follow therein, but narrow is the path and few there will be that makes it to Heaven""....God wants everyone to be in Heaven, but at a certain point in your life comes 'free will' and if you make the wrong choices and do not repent, you are lost brother, its just that simple. You can call God and His son Jesus names and think it unfair simply because you reason as a human. The God-Head (the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit) do not adhere to such simplistic humanistic thinking and reasoning. It's your choice brother. deny him and spend eternity with Lucifer. Accept Jesus, be baptized and live a Christian life and you'll live with God and the Son in such beauty where no tears are ever seen and even the laws of physics cease to exist. Please think about it, do not harden your heart, my words are sincere and are sent to you with a caring heart.  The time is growing near. The Bible says that ""no man knoweth the hour or the day that the Son of Man shall return"". But as sure as I'm writing this Jesus will return and take the innocent with him. After that, what happens on planet Earth is unspeakable in it's horror. Man is left along to his own devices and at that point all that is wrong with the human condition will be unleashed. Surely you don't want to be a part of the latter. Come with the Saints, its not too late. Again, soften your heart and mind.

If you don't believe we're right, you can certainly say so, but say it with some maturity, not cussing and ridiculous insults. We Christians don't care about cursing or hatred of our fellow human beings, bashing them and spitting in their faces when we think their beliefs are wrong as others do. That's what many, many atheists do, especially against followers of Jesus for some reason. Instead of using the F-word and making yourself look like a blind internet thug who only cares about insulting religious people, why don't you atheists start explaining in mature, sensible words why you believe you are right.

2014-10-03T00:51:51,"I'm a Christian, but I don't care for this type of movie. Here is why: One, MOST Christian denominations do NOT teach this idea of the Rapture. This idea of Rapture--of suddenly all the chosen few vanishing and going up to heaven---is universally debunked, rejected, and doubted by the VAST majority of Christian sects. Only a tiny minority of Christian sects preaches that the Rapture will occur.  Two, while I used to be a fan of Nicolas Cage many years ago, when he actually did some decent drama, these days the man will take a paycheck from ANYONE for ANY role. And, in action roles, Cage comes across as the same guy, over and over again. He's one-dimensional.  Heck, if you watched him in ""Con Air"", then watch him in THIS movie, it's the same whining, yelling, moaning man. He gets old, real fast. The man made only ONE great movie(""Leaving Las Vegas"") and most of the others are either annoying or mediocre.  One more thing: only ONE well-made movie about the concept of the Rapture has ever been done, and it was made back in 1991 with Mimi Rogers. I'll wager 90% of you have never seen it: it was called ""The Rapture"", and it was actually quite interesting. Parts are very riveting, and bizarre.

I see atheist like the ones below me in the comments board bashing Christianity & monotheistic religions saying this movie makes it look stupid & maybe that's because it is a movie but what do atheists really believe? Most believe in a form of Darwinian evolution but evolution itself would not even work without God or an intelligence behind it. Charles Dawkins and all other respected atheist darwinian evolutionists believe aliens from another dimension came here and put DNA samples on the backs of crystals and the crystals grew legs then they were struck by lightning that came from another dimension then crawled into a pile of mud that came from another dimension and all these things formed and then we had a monkey fish squirrel frog thing that butt fucked another monkey fish squirrel frog then they gave birth and slowly we got to where we are today but to me that sounds crazier than Christianity ever could! Really that sounds crazier than Scientology! Evolution couldn't work without God so why is God the enemy to evolution and not the solution to the problem instead of aliens that came from another dimension and no one knows where those aliens came from but it was some other type of dimension & they were created the same way as us by aliens from another dimension lmao!. So all you atheists that believe in the Atheist version of darwinian evolution that bash this movie & the people that believe in it have no place to speak. Just saying! Really we all have questions and no one has all the answers & I believe as a Christian we're not meant to understand everything right now as we are on earth & limited. Some things we need to just believe & have faith in! I believe that as part of coming to know God is have faith in him but that doesn't mean we should throw our common sense out the window & everything is either supernatural or just science! I believe God gave us common sense for God is not the author of confusion. & I believe God works through science is & science is a small example of what God really is. But will not force my views on anyone and I sure as hell will not let someone take away my views or beliefs we need to all respect each other for we are not all idiots! & the fact that atheists bash Christians and Christians bash atheist doesn't help with the debate or the people.

Scripture in the book of Matthews tells us that, ""unless we become pure in heart like children, then we won't enter the Kingdom of Heaven."" Children don't know sin until their old enough to distinguish between what's good and what's evil. There are a lot of people that are ignorant to God's Love, and Purpose for our lives. He created man in His image so that we could have dominion over the Earth and give Him the Glory for His creation. We lost our power when Adam and Eve partook of the fruit in the garden (disobedient separated us from God). We regained our power when Jesus (The Way, Truth, Light, Perfect Sacrifice, Without Sin) died and resurrected for our sins. All we have to do is receive the FREE gift of Salvation by believing/ accepting Jesus into our hearts as Lord, and proclaiming with our mouth that He is indeed Son of God.   The great thing about God, is that he's giving you FREE WILL to either believe or don't believe. But regardless of what you believe, everything you choose in life had consequences (good and bad). Are you willing to gamble the destiny of your eternal soul to Hell, because you were too stubborn or arrogant to atleast find out who God is and what He wants for your life? Get to know God/Jesus first and completely before making your final judgment.   If God isn't real, then there wouldn't be life in man, plants, or animals. There's a spiritual warfare going on, and has been since the beginning of times. Stop letting Satan deceive you, and use to create war against God. And if you think neither God or Satan exists, then you've already been received.

(Read Daniel 11).  In Daniel's day/time God told him to seal up those things which he saw because they were not for his day..but were for the end.  Now we are in the end (Rev is the last book of the Bible) and NOW those things wgich were sealed can now be revelealed or understood correctly.  The fact of the matter is that YES those that are in Christ (whether dead or STILL alive) SHALL meet the Lord in the AIR. (1 Thess 4:13-18) But 1 Corinthians 15:50-53 tells us that we shall be changed at THE LAST TRUMP (Rev 19).  This is when the chucch (The Bride of Christ) meets Jesus (The Bridegroom) to get our glorified bodies so that  we can make a U-turn back to earth to rule and reign with Christ 1,000yrs (1000yrs = a day to God).  In other words, the Kingdom of God is at hand and it will be here on earth not heaven....which is why we are to pray in the manner Jesus told us to pray in Matthew 6:9-13.  THY KINGDOM COME IN/ON EARTH  not heaven.  There is no rapture but there is a place of safety.  Jesus said in Luke 21:36 to pray that we may be counted worthy to ESCAPE all these things which shall come to pass.  If there was a rapture, that would mean that God's ELECT (True worshippers) would not be here to experience the tribulation period. Right?  Well Matthew 24:22 states that the events that are soon to hit this earth, NO FLESH would be able to survive (that's how devastating these events will be)...BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE ELECT...those days will not last a long time.  Its time the truth be told and take God at His every Word.  We are in time where nuclear bombs are being created to wipe out all humanity if possible.  Its just a matter of time.  Study and do not be deceived by people of position...Live by every Word that proceeds out of the Mouth of God.   If God only saved Noah and his family (8 people total) when he destroyed the earth with flood....then woe be unto them who will not heed His Word now (for this time earth will be destroyed by fire).  Just like in Noah's day - there was a place of safety (The Ark) provided to him and his family.  God will provide us the same safety (those that will obey Hiw Will)Isaiah 40:31, Rev 3:10-11, Rev 12, Daniel 12.  (Remember the church of God is always referred to as a ""woman,"" because the true church is His Bride).  Some Christians will not enter the place of safety due to their lukewarm attitudes Rev 3:15-19 & Rev 12:17.  They must suffer and die in the tribulation to build character necessary to enter in the Kingdom of God so they can reign with Christ.  This tribulation period will last 3.5 yrs not 7yrs as some may have been told.  Keep researching the Scriptures and ask God for wisdom. ",0,0,Jehovaz Daughter,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.0898809523809524,2014-10-04 16:29:56,False,True

You atheist say that you have no belief in spirituality but every human believes in something, even when you claim not to. Since you believe that there is no god and you think it's a virus, you believe in that statement, so truly we all believe in something. And I also don't see the reason why you atheist always jump on Christianity soooo much. You don't say anything about Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, or any other religion. You always have to shut the Christians down, and that shows your ignorance of god because if you guys believe we were all bacteria on the backs of crystals on a hot planet, explain to me where they came from or the things that made that come from and so on and so forth. Evolutionism is missing a link and y'all just don't want people to see your weakness. Truly we don't have to believe in God, we choose what we want to do because we are me in God's image in the book of Genesis so, since god made choices, he gave us the right to make our own desicions, and when we make the wrong ones, you have to pay for it later. I've seen with my own eyes people who flat-out don't believe in anything, but give their lives to Christ so. And if you are truly atheist, 1st, why did you watch this video just to make you angry, 2nd, why are you making comments on a God that you belief that isn't real. Understand that God's word and church aren't going to stand down and be quiet anymore, y'all hate Christianity so much, just like Satan does, that you want to shut down anything that involves Christianity. Watch the documentary called Monumental: In Search of America's National Treasure and you'll see. You don't think us Christians question our faith at times, but then God stills proves that he loves us and he loves you too atheist, He doesn't care who you are, or what you claim to be, he still loves you so you can get saved, and won't be left behind. If you are a true atheist, don't involve yourself into Christian territory, because I thought y'all didn't believe in a god so why watch the video, or make comments to people who are scholars of their faith, or even try to get people not to believe because you aren't living up to your name. God says on this rock(earth) it will build my church, and the gates of hell(anything against God) WILL NOT prevail against it. You don't think there were people on those times who didn't believe in God. Get the Book 100 scientific facts of the bible.

2014-10-14T05:13:31," Watched some of this, and things support exactly why God is not going to come and do a ""secret Flyby"" I.e. the Rapture is the Return of Christ coming Sat on a Cloud Rev 14. Which i think is a summary Chapter and it says 14 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.  15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.  16 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.  17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.  18 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.  19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.  20 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.   HENCE Jesus God & Holy Spirit are not going to take people ""in Secret"" and when they do it is the Return of Christ and it is at the time of Armageddon.   I cannot imagine Why would God take peoples Babies, Children and partners in secret and leave the relations in such terrible stress. God is not in the business of causing stress but rather relieving it and is a God of love.   We would not be up there in the clouds looking down on our loved ones for years months or weeks or days while they go through HUGE emotional torment. That is not My God not in the least.   But having said that Rev 14 says or hints it happens in the same hour as Armageddon.  This I can see and believe.  But Rapture while our love ones go through 42 months of the Microchip / phoenix beast currency is simply ludicrous....  Therefore while a lot of Christians think this film is good, I think it portrays a God of insensibility to family exactly the opposite of He who was on the Cross when he said mother here is your son, John here is your mother.   This film is from what I have seen thus far is showing God to be a person he is not. And therefore I believe it should be discarded into the trash can.!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The Rapture is when Jesus returns and not before and there are many scriptures and maths to back this up and   only distortions of scripture are used for this Rapture Theory  Rapture Theory vs the Truth, Rapture is when Jesus returns and not before..  hence Christians you are on Earth for approximately 1260 days after the birth of the Antichrist (Prince William of Wales & the Rothschild's) microchip 7:36AM Jerusalem 23/09/2017  which 23/09/2017 + 1260 days to the expiry of the beast's Authority over the Saints Rev 12 makes it 8th March 2021......     You will be on earth for over another 6 years maybe more maybe less. and Raptured when Jesus returns when the Beast s authority is over as only God determines that, but rest assured he may or will come early so some flesh is saved on the Earth but will he find faith?    Because if people rely on this information of the movie their faith may expire early.    Keep your Lamp Trimmed and don't believe in this False believe of rapture in secret.",11,0,Barry Gumm,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.050677506775067764,2014-10-14 05:13:31,False,True

It wasn't the best movie in the world, Cage resembled a B list actor in it (which I don't think was his fault, this wasn't his type of movie)  Generally speaking, this was just a disaster/survival movie. The main actress, if not a certified Atheist, was whole heartedly Anti-God, even when faced with the realization of Rapture. It actually made her despise him more. At the end, no one turned religious. No one decided they all needed to repent to be saved. No one started a cult to make amends to God.   Most of the movie revolved around Cage's flight and how to get home.

Of coarse it's ""Hollywooded Up"" and does not follow the Bible verbatim as in the book of Revelations. Many of you are arguing the general story itself by misinterpreting it and taking what you wish out of context. Read it in its entirety and ask a pastor or church clergy if you still have ?'s. The Bible is TRUE.  It has been proven over and over. This Great country has been built on its very principles.  Our Laws that are on the books right now are similar to the ten commandments,  our monet "" In God we Trust"". We are born with the instincts of right from wrong. Yes you choose to follow god by faith . God is a kind loving God. Every person on this earth and in the future are no mistake. God created each and every one of you for him with your own unique gifts and purpose. He had your life planned out before you were ever born. He choose your sex, race, from what country you live, your parents, your friends. You are all part of his magnificent plan.He did this not because he was lonely but because of his perfect love for each and every one of you. Me I grew up as a Christian and it's normal to have questions,  get mad at god sometimes have good and bad days. The difference with me is I know that I am going to Heaven to be with my Heavenly Father forever in paradise.  I accepted the free gift of acknowledging the fact that he died on the cross for my sins he paid the ultimate price so I would not have to. I asked him for forgiveness of my sins and Thanked him. It's that simple this is the meaning of being a Christian not by my "" works"". Don't get me wrong I do many kind things in his name to his glory I want to give back for he has done so much for me. This is the best thing of all ""ONCE SAVE ALWAYS SAVED"".  I will never loose my Salvation. And for the skeptics out there I pray that you find peace if you open your mind the facts and proof you feel you need in order to believe it is out there you j late not looking in the right places. I hate to think that you are on this earth for no reason no purpose of your life how sad for you not to have any hope you die and that is that. What was your purpose? God Bless You All! PS.

2014-11-16T22:09:08,"I've seen a LOT of movies and honestly this was the most offensive movie I've ever seen. I think it creates a new genre called ""Christian God-Porn"" where it basically acts as one big love-fest for the Christian version of the invisible man in the clouds who is watching and listening to everyone. It's a very long and expensive commercial for the fairytale religious people choose to believe in!!  I don't mind if movies like this are made, I don't believe in censorship, however I think it should come with a warning note at the start of the movie to let people know what they are about to watch is a Christian movie. That way if you're offended or not interested in such things, you have the choice whether to watch it or not. By the time I realized I was watching a Christian movie it was too late, I'd watched most of it already. I hoped there would be some kind of twist or something at the end, but there wasn't.    Unless you're a Christian or you don't mind watching a Christian movie, stay away from this, it's horrible.  I felt dirty after watching it.  That's my honest opinion.   Please don't attack me for that opinion if you're Christian, remember, you are entitled to your opinion and I am entitled to mine - I am not attacking anyone for any religious Christian comments and opinions here, so please don't attack me for mine.   I'm not necessarily an Atheist by the way, I'm just honest in saying that I don't know what's out there. However, I don't believe in any religion and nor do I want to watch some kind of Christian Propaganda film - or a propaganda film for any religion.  I feel tricked into it to be honest because nowhere on the cover does it say it's a Christian movie, I didn't spot a Jesus Fish or Cross on the cover.....  I should have read more about it before watching it, obviously. If I had known this was Christian God-Porn I never would have watched it.  ",0,0,David Dexter,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.06611793611793611,2014-11-16 22:09:08,False,True

This is not how the ""Rapture"" will work... :D In fact you will and could NEVER find the word ""Rapture"" in the Bible :D I'm a Christian and I know that the Rapture Theology was popularized in the 1820s-1830s by John Darby.  Matthew 13:24-30 ...'Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; [NO] lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together FIRST the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.'  Oh look, We will meet AT the Harvest, not the Tribulation. AT THE HARVEST. Rapture theology is only really popular in America, which is pretty funny for a Christian. I mean, there's most likely an issue with this theory if America is looked at as ""weird"" by other Christians in the world. This is NOT Biblical.

2014-12-01T02:52:05,"Seriously?  Left Behind is a book series that died YEARS ago and for good reason. It got everyone in this apocalyptic mindset and everyone was sure the rapture was going to happen any moment so the books flew off the shelves. Now everyone treats Left Behind like it was a one night stand that no one really wants to acknowledge or remember. Honestly, if they wanted people to come see this movie they should have picked up a little farther on in the series.  From a fictional standpoint, it is a very good idea for a film if its done right which from the trailers and reviews I'm certain they didn't.  Its just the classic disaster film that everyone has seen already. The real story picks up in the later books when Nicolae Carpathia drops his facade and assumes the role of the antichrist freely. True, in the books it jumps to the areas of ridiculousness fairly often that only the die hard fanatic took as truth instead of entertainment. Personally, I feel that Christianity has many unexplored opportunities to become Hollywood Blockbusters. I've been waiting YEARS for a movie based off of Paradise Lost. If done right a movie about the war in heaven and Lucifers fall could be EPIC. Far better than these disaster movies that are put in our faces over and over. Honestly, if they expected us to take Left Behind  seriously they shouldn't have cast Nicolas Cage as Ray Steele. But then I know that was done because he's the only celebrity crazy enough to actually take the role. ",0,0,James Hallock,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.10833002645502644,2014-12-01 02:52:05,False,True

2014-12-28T03:23:32," Anyone can see that we are heading towards a one-world system and government. This was predicted in the Scriptures of the Bible during a time when it was un-thinkable! The only way nations will give up their independence, willing to be led by an outside global government, is when all of the world somehow ends up in the same boat of a terrible calamity. Many global organizations are already in place: WHO (World Health Org.); World Bank; World Trade Org.; United Nations with its own military; Interfaith Church etc. But how can the devil run a world system through a man called the anti-christ?(1Jn.3; 2Jn.1:7) First of all, he needs control. With modern technology (satellites etc.) all this has become an easy task. Facebook, Twitter; cellphones, and cameras at every street corner are great tracking devices and also give any government a clear picture of who you are, where you live and who you might oppose. The final device, used to achieve total control, will be the RFID chip, implanted under the skin (see You Tube). A horrific disaster striking all of the nations at the same time will cause them to look for someone to lead them out of their troubles. Even secular Hollywood producers have envisioned such an event with a meteor threatening to destroy the earth, or some alien invasion coming upon us. One thing that all of the nations on earth have in common are Christians. The disappearance of them would cause horrific disasters, putting the whole world into the same boat of major distress. (see Matt. 24:40-41; John 14:1-3; 1Thes.4:16/17) 	However, I believe not all who call themselves Christians will be gone, taken up into the clouds. (1Thes.4:17) Those who have only made a half-hearted commitment, sitting on the fence while adding a little bit of Jesus to their worldly lifestyle, might be left behind. But since these “lukewarm” Christians (Rev.3:16) know the truth, they then will jump off the fence, now pursuing Christ whole-heartedly. And they will also be the ones who will bring in the unprecedented end-time harvest of countless souls. The time of the disappearance (rapture) of millions of Christians world-wide will initiate the forming of a one-world system with the antichrist as it's leader. This antichrist, empowered by satan, will be able to perform miraculous signs, and his charismatic personality will far surpass that of all of the world leaders of the past combined. His speeches will be hypnotizing, and with today's modern technology he will be able to address the whole world. Seeing is believing. When we can see that ancient prophecies are unfolding exactly as foretold, we can believe that there is indeed a spiritual, unseen world. As much as God is real, so also the devil!  ",0,0,Mario Alleckna,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.05749341238471673,2014-12-28 03:23:32,False,True

Do they count when they're a zygote? What about fully developed babies at the moment of being born? Will they be raptured as they leave the womb? What about the belief that a newborn goes to hell unless they are baptized? Or are they 'safe' due to innocence?  What about children then? At what age does your god determine they are no longer 'innocent' enough to be raptured? Is there a specific hour, minute, second?  Why is it that everyone that I've asked has a different idea of what would happen? They claim they know the truth, and yet everyone has something different to say. If the truth is so inconsistent, how can we think of it as true at all? You may go back to the bible and say that it is the word of god and thus true, which is a circular argument. Harry Potter would not be true if it claimed it was true.  The bible is not considered a reliable source. Since any particular source my be fabricating their story, multiple independent sources are usually required for confidence. Establishing the lack of author biases, including religious motivations, is also necessary if a work is to be read at face value. The Bible satisfies none of these requirements.  Not to mention there are various contradicting passages (2 different creation myths, Genesis 1:1-2:3 and Genesis 2:4-25), many examples of human rights violations (Judges 19:25-28, where a man sends out his concubine to an angry crowd, where she is brutally raped, and he hardly acknowledge the fact), an astounding lack of evidence for a global flood, of Herod's slaughter of the innocent (Matthew 2:16–18), of the dead rising and roaming Jerusalem (Matthew 27:52-53, you would expect for there to be first hand accounts of such an extraordinary event, but there is nothing outside of the bible that mentions it), and there has been no evidence for the 10 plagues in Exodus.

I never expected this movie to be of the religious fear mongering type till after I finished. I just love how some truly believe their religion is ""the way"". When in reality no one REALLY KNOWS anything. I believe there is something out there but I do not go by the words of man. Just because man has told you it is not his words doesn't make it truth. I've seen & read of more wars in the name of man's idea of religion and the way of life then anything from god himself. In fact I've never even spoke to god, to know anyone man/women's claims to be fact from god.

There was no rapture for the first 3 centuries of brutal Christian persecution nor in the subsequent centuries that followed.  You can't get to Easter Sunday until you go through Good Friday.   Christ said we have a cross to bear and that we too must drink from His cup of suffering.   St Paul says ""he makes up for what is lacking in the suffering of Christ.""  Everything Christ went through His Church will too.  Including persecution and resurrection.  Christ didn't suffering and die so we wouldn't have to, He sanctified it, made it an act of self-donation and love that we are called to imitate His example.  By uniting our suffering and the crosses Jesus puts in our life to His we fulfill God the Father's plan as adopted sons and daughters of God.  No Fundamentalists you won't escape the persecution to come and its foolish pride to think so when all your Christian Brothers and Sisters bared the cross before you, you are not more special then they were.  As a matter of fact they will be more highly blessed in Heaven for living a life so close to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. ",0,0,teton99,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.02600840336134454,2015-01-29 02:53:59,False,False

It's by no means a great movie but it's definitely not a bad one either! Anyhow, in the movie the good and practicing Christians in addition to all children are taken to heaven by God, however, there is what seems to be a practicing and good Muslim stuck on the plane with the sinners, blasphemers and non-believers! This is very interesting, because whoever made the movie thinks that Muslims don't believe in God and therefore have no place in heaven.  Just for the record, Muslims do believe in God and not some random deity that they call ""Allah"" as most non-Muslims think, they actually believe in the same God of Christianity and Judaism, and the literal translation for the commonly used Arabic word ""Allah"" -or more accurately ""Al Lah""- in English is ""The God"" where ""Al"" translates to ""The"" and ""Lah"" translates to ""God"", even Arab Christians use the word ""Allah"" to refer to God BTW.  Generally speaking and without going into details, Islam as a belief, has more commonality with Christianity than difference, and if you don't buy what I stated because of a perception or prejudice, you can Google it and find out for yourself.

You are not the good person that you have convinced yourself that you are and so you are in trouble with a Holy and Just God. GOOD NEWS - Jesus paid the debt that you couldn't pay. He suffered and died on your place so that you don't have to.  He took your punishment for you.  So all you have to do is accept that Jesus died for you, and allow Him to come into your life by His Spirit to guide and lead you and you will be saved.  This won't be an easy life, it will be difficult. The greatest difficulty is facing the fact that you have got it so wrong. Allow Jesus in. Accept His free gift of life today.

I detest those people. When I was a teen I decided that nobody would interfere in what i believe, and I am very sorry for Atheists because unlike me they haven't found God. I believe in Science and I believe in God. I was raised Catholic but I now i have no religion I don't go to church,  I don't believe in Catholics or evangelicals or whatever. I believe in god and in the bible, I pray everyday. I support gay marriage, abortion and experiments with stem cells, but all of that doesn't make me have less faith.   Atheists should stop generalizing, God is not about the people that believe in him or the people that control the church.

2015-03-27T14:07:11,"23% of the Bible is prophetic, meaning, foretells to us what is going to happen before it happens, to 100% accuracy. That is indisputable, no matter what anyone believes. Manuscript experts attest to the Bible's reliability and authenticity. That is, even non Christian experts. The further one digs into the Bible, or seeks to demolish its veracity, the inevitable begins to dawn. Just ask Ivan Panin Russian mathematician, or CS Lewis, Newton, Einstein, Pascal, Boyle, Faraday, Kepler, Galileo, Copernicus, Descartes, Kelvin, Max Planck (quantum theory) and Bacon, who is quoted as saying: ""It is true, that a little philosophy inclines man’s mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy brings men's minds about to religion; for while the mind of man looks upon second causes scattered, it may sometimes rest in them, and go no further; but when it beholds the chain of them confederate, and linked together, it  'excels toward' Providence and Deity.""  If you saw the movie and wonder why tragedy culminates toward the end of human history, you will learn from study of the Bible that God is out of this world patient, not willing anyone should perish, but that everyone come to repentance and inherit from Him, eternal life, through faith in Christ.  God's character includes justice, holiness and mercy. God cannot allow injustice to prevail and inevitably reign, without eventual intervention (patient). God does not tolerate sin because he is holy. Sin cannot abide or even coexist in the presence of God because it would be burned up by holiness. Mercy - God does not leave us in condemnation through exacting perfect justice, in accordance with his holy character, but rather gives us all the gift of forgiveness through the substitutionary death (satisfies justice for wrongdoing) of Christ for our sins. In a sense, we don't go to hell for our sins, but rather our rejection of Christ. We all have a choice to believe in Christ's work on the cross, or reject him, and let pride and arrogance get in the way of God's attempts at reaching us with his truth, and the demonstration of his love. He could have just written us off and started over completely with creation, but 'God is love.' ",0,0,firstbornjordan,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.13359375,2015-03-27 14:07:11,False,False

As a system, dispensationalism is expounded in the writings of John Nelson Darby (1800–82) and the Plymouth Brethren movement,[1]:10 and propagated through works such as Cyrus Scofield's Scofield Reference Bible. The theology of dispensationalism consists of a distinctive eschatological end times perspective, as all dispensationalists hold to premillennialism and most hold to a pretribulation rapture. Dispensationalists believe that the nation of Israel is distinct from the Christian Church,[2]:322 and that God has yet to fulfill his promises to national Israel. These promises include the land promises, which in the future world to come result in a millennial kingdom and Third Temple where Christ, upon his return, will rule the world from Jerusalem[3] for a thousand years. In other areas of theology, dispensationalists hold to a wide range of beliefs within the evangelical and fundamentalist spectrum.[1]:13  My Comments : The Church is the Body of Christ.

The penalty in the Bible for murder is death, by the hand of MAN shall a murder be put to death, he shall be killed. So no True Christian should be against the death penalty for murderers, if they are they are opposing the word of God. 2) The Old Testament is the Hebrew Torah and should have little meaning to Christians, because Jesus gave us the New Testament and the new covenant with God. 3) Jesus never said that a persons sexual orientation has anything to do with Gods love for you. Leviticus spoke against homosexuality but he also spoke against eating shell fish but I don't see Christians protesting Red Lobster restaurants. Most of the teachings of Leviticus were health issues for people living in the desert. Read Leviticus and see how many of his teaching you are breaking before you go about hating gay people. 4) Homosexuality was seen as distracting men from fathering children, thus weakening the tribe. In an agrarian society, more children to share the work load was a good thing so anything that got in the way of that was viewed as bad. Most modern men confuse homosexuality with pedophilia even though gay men are just as outraged at pedophiles as straight men are. Again, Jesus never taught that homosexuals would go to Hell. 5) There is NO pre-tribulations rapture of Christian. All you Christians will go through the persecutions of the anti-Christ just like the rest of us poor souls, so get over yourselves. 6) Lilith is the first wife of Adam and was created at the same time, her strong will and refusal to submit to Adam's wishes led to her being caste out. Lilith was caste out of the Garden for the sin of seeing herself as Adam's equal, not as his servant. Eve was created later to be weak of will and so failed to resist Satan's temptations, Lilith would not have failed. 7) The Bible was not meant to be taken literally, it is an attempt to explain the world to primitive and uneducated people in such a way that they can understand it. The Old Testament was heavily influenced by the early Hebrews racist and self centered view of the world. There are many lessons in the Bible on how NOT to act toward your fellow man. 8) American Christians have been kept in a constant state of fear by conmen and liars, who have preached end times dogma for decades. Even though the Bible says no one can know the hour of Christ return, these conmen say otherwise. They are false prophets and should be tarred and feathered. 9) Creationism is an attack on our God given ability to reason and should be rejected. God works on large time scales, the size and age of the Universe proves that.  The conmen are so afraid to be called out that even as Christians die in the middle east, they do nothing to help. No money flows from American Christians to their brothers in Lebanon or even Bethlehem, the conmen keep it all to themselves. No outrage as Coptic Christians are beheaded, no call to arms to defend Christian communities and Churches that date back to the time of Christ. From Christians there is silence, confusion, and fear. How the Devil must laugh.  These are just a few of the problems confronting True Christians as we struggle to maintain our faith from attacks from without and within the Christian community.",1,0,Folker46 !,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.056657811885084605,2015-04-27 19:32:22,False,False

If not, your opinions, your life, or your desires and hopes don't matter. I am a scientific person. Even though I can't prove God exists, I believe love, life, and individuality matter so I CHOOSE to believe God exists. I was an atheist once. But the truth was I didn't want to be held accountable for my life. I wanted to do what I wanted to do. I wanted to make my own destiny. Is that not the allure of FREEDOM? Is that not my right? I found out that it is not. In this world freedom is an illusion. We are all bound by something. It is either someone something or mostly themselves. Do we not want to keep ourselves happy? Do we not want pleasure? We were created. Who knows what we want and desire than our Creator? Yet we want to do things our way. God loves you and me very much. That is why he will not let go of you. HE will prove to you he exists through people, events in your life and even this post. Me writing all this was set by God for you to read and understand him better. Nothing tells a kid his parents don't love him than when they let him do what he wants. Because God CARES he disciplines and ALLOWS bad stuff to happen but the root of it is humanity's stubbornness to ignore God so God will turn the heat up. Eventually he will prove he exists when he stands in front of you in the apocalypse or in judgement day when you die. I have researched over and over and God does exist. Man cannot prove he exists but he most certainly can't prove he doesn't. In science everything has a cycle. Beginning to End. Only one source in the entire world offers complete information about the cycle of the world with 100% accuracy so far and that is the BIBLE.  Is it not "" innocent until proven guilty"" so why don't you guys acknowledge Gods existence until you can prove he doesn't? God has nothing to prove. He created everything you have experienced and humanity's lifetime is like a novel to him yet your feelings and hopes matter to him because he loves you so much. We are his children whether we we want to or not. We can accept him or reject him and dare him to prove his existence.

I sure you've noticed how easy that story goes on Rome and kind of shoves everything off on the Jews when Jesus was supposed to be Jewish. And the account they give is pretty calm considering Palestine was in open warfare with Rome at the time. Odd that nobody considers that. But then again, people have certainly been encouraged, if not outright coerced, to believe without question. I would think that even if you were really down with the story you might think the prophecies had been fulfilled when King Baldwin I, who believed himself of direct descent of the Line of David, established the Kingdom of Heaven in Jerusalem on December 25th, 1100 CE. Baldwin himself certainly did. Add that thinking the world is suddenly going to end at any minute is a common symptom of schizophrenia and you get... what? Hey, there are a lot of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints that believe that the Mountain Meadow Massacre never happened; but I've read the trial transcripts. It happened.

That people think that Christians are Georgia mental or I had the critical or are a whole switch in reality not on the wall my like that like the lady at the airport that was talking about the tsunami subs and I'm free the more I can understand why the father and the daughter will let behind the father was cheating however the daughter was and I'm believer but then again they're talking badly towards the mother as if she were to be cheating when in reality she just there Christian at home I should just believe in God on top of that in the plane there are other people that are you left behind because the Chinese guy believes in area 51 that's just dumb and then the short guy I can understand he's an a****** but then again the other flight attendant she was a gossiper and nosey and stuff like that so that's considered pure I don't think so the other day to flight attendants were in pure and their own thoughts because the blonde one was cheating even though she didn't know that she had a husband and then the other one was just being nosey being nosey is as bad as being anything is it if you read the Bible you will forget the sound so this movie fails in a lot of things the show is what the true meaning of what God is trying to tell us and it also fails to glorify I will Christians we are because in this movie there hypocrites  they make them seem as if they are better than everybody else but in reality everybody falls short in God's eyes because we all fail to the pill what he really wants we are not here we are imperfect creatures so does it really matter if your Christia Catholic for whatever you are you know better than anybody else all you can do is live your life as good as possible you can without judging anybody because that's exactly what this movie does a judge's everybody because they are not Christian and that is false right there God loves everybody no matter what it is on my what they did as long as if you ask for forgiveness,0,0,alex O,GrXe8YDbzYs,0.04083517245281953,2016-01-06 20:05:10,False,False

There is this space, and the houses are behind him, as he stands there on the street.  So, the effect is one of - there is government, but at the same time, there is not.  They drive away.  He stands there, staring.  You really got this sense of people versus government (imaginary, and real).  Have not seen this movie, but I thought the original was brilliantly filmed.  There is this one scene where you see a dog, with a leash, but no owner - that was funny - evidence that dogs do not go to heaven. ..

It is also a shame that Vic Armstrong and thee filmmakers do not understand what the Holy Bible teaches. The whole ""left behind"" premise is completely unBiblical. Jesus in Matthew 24 clearly tells us the saved (real followers of Christ) will go through the great tribulation and will be persecuted, hunted down and killed for their faith. The book of Revelation clearly teaches this too.  There is a rapture (which means to be taken away) but it is also clear when this happens and who sees it, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-16 speaks of it...And tells us all the world will se e him. After this, the world does not just go on and planes to dot fall from the sky, the entire world will go in to judgment.  For the people here claiming ""If God sends people to hell even if they're good then he's a monster"" are wrong. Again, go and actually read the Bible, that clearly tells us ""for the wages of sin is death"" and ""all have fallen short of the glory of God."" In other words, no matter how good you think you are, we have all sinned, and no one thing with sin can enter the coming Kingdom of God and inherit the coming new earth, where this earth will end and God will remake his original plan, and end satan's rule as the god of this world.

This is the second coming. Thus, it's rapture firstm then seven years with the antichrist, then the visible second coming of Jesus Christ."" on page 30 Steve said ""These popular concept - rapture, seven years f horror, future antichirst - have been taught in many apocalyptic Christian (it means Born Again cult members) films such as A Thief in the Night, Image of the Beast, Tribulation Force, The Omega Code, Left Behind: The Movie, and Meggiddo.""

2020-04-19T16:50:50,"RAPTURE READY!  We are ""on call"" 24/7 awaiting the CALL of Jesus Christ from space above. Maranatha! HE COMES.  John 14: 1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.  Titus 2: 11 For the grace of God that brings salvation hath appeared to all men, 12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ; 14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. 15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.  We KNOW this IS our time to serve God's glory.  The Great Commission Jesus says, ""And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."" Mark chapter 15: verse 16  Romans 10 : verse 17: So faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.  Romans 10: 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!  Believe  Isaiah chapter 7: verse 14: Therefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call him Emmanuel meaning: Hebrew: עִמָּנוּאֵל, ""God with us"" (Jesus Christ) in human flesh as man, but without sin. His shed blood would eventually pay the price for all the sins of all sinners! And he would be crucified and die and rise from the dead on the third day. Jesus had to die. His death, burial, resurrection, and shedding of His sinless blood were necessary to pay for all sins once and for all. (See * 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 and * Ephesians 1: 7 below)  "" For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"" Romans chapter 3: verse 23  ""The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."" Romans chapter 6: verse 23  John 3 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world; but may the world through him be saved.  ""I am the way, the truth and the life: nobody comes to the Father but through me"". (John 14.6)  ""... Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and was buried, and on the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures"" 1 Cor. 15: 3-4  ""In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace."" Ephesians 1: 7  ""Because this is my blood from the New Testament, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins."" Matthew, chap. 26: verse 28  Ephesians 2: ""8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Romans 10: 9 That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved. 10 For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  Salvation, the forgiveness of sins, is available to anyone who has received the Gospel who trusts Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. Those who have rejected salvation (see John 3: 16-17 above), according to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, will suffer judgment for their sins (perish) and eternal separation from God and the Family of God on earth and in heaven forever in the Lake of Fire.
