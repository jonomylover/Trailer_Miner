I never imagined or even saw people who were in poverty like the ones portrayed in the movie. I remember my parents friends saying how poor people smelled bad and just thought that was normal. We treated our maids and chauffeurs like second class citizens and forgot about their humanity and their equality. I lived with big hopes and dreams and so carelessly because I never had to worry about food, my clothes, or anything else for that matter. We lived like kings and treated our fellow man who did not have as much as trash that can be discarded anytime. Just seeing that there was a whole another side to Korea filled with poverty stricken people trying to survive put me in a state of shock as I watched the movie. How foolish I have been to think that everyone in Korea lived as we did. My heart goes out to the people struggling everywhere in the world and I have to say this movie humbled me.

But wait a second, the movie is called parasite, so the other parts of the poor family invade almost or like infiltrate the lives of the rich people to get even more money. Or wait...maybe they find something or someone living in their house? Like in their attic or something. And that's why it's called Parasite, cause someone is living inside the house and benefiting from it. Like a parasite would?   The nanny is definitely involved.

The word I was searching for came forth in ""hubris"", which ultimately made this an entertaining movie . As you may recall in the story of ""Daedalus"", Icurus's fatal flaw is hubris. He is too arrogant with the wings his father made for him. Despite being warned, he flew too high and the wax melted, causing Icarus to fall to his death. This family in Korea had a fatal flaw of hubris, as seen in their drunken revelry at the master's home while the family was away. They had it made with what they had accomplished, but they could not maintain their integrity due to excessive pride and overconfidence. The threshold of hubris guilt was when they entertained the thought of marrying into the family. The end result of hubris is nemesis, and is seen when the father flees, becomes self-isolated, ""vanishes into thin air"", and family be damned. Worthy of a Greek tragedy. The other compelling comment is the larger issue with Pres Trump's denouncement of the movie. Is that not hubris on a grander scale? Peace and out.

If you’re here wondering what genre it is, all I will say is that it’s almost comedic in the beginning and progresses into a thriller by the end. Please trust me and don’t look for any spoiler videos if you’re planning on watching it. You have to go through the roller coaster of emotions without any spoilers during this film. After you’ve watched the movie, look up an explanation video. The video doesn’t really matter much, unless you were confused, it’s the comments that made me gasp in realization at some of the things that people were bringing to my attention. There are so many callbacks in this film that I would recommend watching a things you missed video and also reading the comments on those. If you’re still not sure about whether or not you should watch this movie, I am telling you right now that I was in the same place and definitely do not regret it.
