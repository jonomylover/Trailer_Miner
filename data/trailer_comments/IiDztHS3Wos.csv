For anyone who is into deep shit movies and the kinds that give you feels everytime you see them, if you like movies of such kinds and not the typical stereotype cliche kinds, go for BOYHOOD. The guy who has made this film is a genius, the thoughts that he has vocalised through the movie for eg the facebook and theory of cyborgs and robots haha I think that was cool! The constant of everything and how ""the moment seizes us"" ya know things that Mason sees and feel, how the characters build up and how the STORYLINE is simple addictive and just beautiful. I loved the mom in the movie, she's the strong headed lady who like everyone else has problems of their own kinds, we all make it through, boyhood did exactly that. It has created history and seriously it's been a different experience watching this movie. Call me a nerd, I have watched it twice and everytime I watch it again, it moves me in a different way.  I haven't really seen something as simple yet beautiful as this movie quite lately in the recent times. Our generation needs to sit back and relax and appreciate the little things in life. This film is everything that you need to experience if you're just as confused and awkward and normal like Mason (:   ""You don't need the bumpers.
