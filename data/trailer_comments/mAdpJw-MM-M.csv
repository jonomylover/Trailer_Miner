I am reading the book at the moment.  Emma's peculiarity is Fire, not air, and the ship wreck, Emma and Jacob went to talk on was only just below the surface so that they could stand on it out on the water.  They never dove down to it and Emma certainly didn't fill it with air.  It looks like how Jacob comes across the Home is quite different (Emma never invited him to come and see the rest as the trailer seems to suggest she does).  Since Emma is now the one that floats, the much younger girl in the book that floats (Olive) doesn't seem to be there any more.  The girl who could make plants grow was much older in the book than the one portrayed doing so in the trailer and is described as being wild in appearance, as is the photo of her shown in the book.

I mean what a waste what redundant.... I don't know what's worse this or the thing that I unaffectionatly refer to a ""trailer of a trailer"". you know, the videos that claim to be a movie teaser trailer but instead it is a shorter version of the official trailer that gives the full length trailer's release date, and tells you to watch it. it's usually only a week away from the actual trailer if that. in other words instead of releasing a trailer to get us hyped for a movie they're showing us a snippet of a trailer to advertise that trailer which is advertising the movie. while I have always felt that a good trailer is a perfect marriage between marketing and art it is still technically an advertisement and let's be real... a trailer for a trailer is essentially advertising a commercial. what sense does that make. and usually the actual trailer was only a week away so why bother wasting the film editors time to make this thing when a finished trailer could be released in a matter of days. actually if I recall correctly, the trailer to pixels trailer was released on the very same day.... as Pixels trailer! what?! I came to watch a trailer guys. why arbitrarily extend the video length by adding a few seconds of footage from a video at the very beginning of the video you are uploading. it's probably just that, to extend the video length just a little so that they can make a few extra pennies. who cares if we already have a completed video with a beginning middle and end edited by talented people who know how to show what clips and when, insuring a well-paced and balanced film that will advertise a movie as well as provide a mild emotional experience for viewers, let's make it a few seconds longer because that will add up more cash.... nobody will notice.  yeah I know it's just nitpicking but hey it annoys me",0,0,Christian Schmude,mAdpJw-MM-M,0.04730392156862745,2016-06-25 14:15:59,True,True

2016-10-04T09:35:06,"Pros and Cons of the movie: (Spoiler Alert!)  Cons: 1. Switching the powers of Emma and Olive. I don't think that was necessary. 2. Butterfield's acting is average. 3. It isn't as dark as compared to the book. (Well, maybe, the scenes had to be softened to embrace a great number of audience.) 4. The script is average. Which probably explained number 2. 5. Some scenes that are meant to be funny didn't make me laugh. 6. I thought wights don't have peculiar powers. 7. What did they do to Miss Avocet?! 8. Is it as good as the book? No. Is it better than the book? Definitely not. 9. Am I disappointed? Yes. Because it's Tim Burton. I was expecting more. He, Guillermo Del Toro and the late and the great Alfred Hitchcock are my heroes to this kind of films. However, this movie looks rushed and scattered. I could see from one transition to another several scenes were cut, and it isn't a clean cut. It looks like Zack Snyder did this.  Pros: 1. Every peculiar child is given a chance to fight using their peculiarity; compared to the first book, they were just running and ALMOST all the fighting depended on Jake. Like what Emma said to Jake in the last act of the movie, ""You taught us how to be brave."" 2. Emma's shoes! They are so cool!  3. Olive ‚ù§Ô∏è Enoch. I think they look good together. Let's just give them a chance. 4. This is my favorite scene--Jake meeting Abe in a different loop, wherein it is implied that Abe was able to give Jake pointers about peculiardom. I was expecting Ransom would include this in one of the Peculiar Children trilogy; however, Abe's role just ended after his death, leaving Jake seeking answers on his own. 5. The children working as a team. Somehow I felt a vibe of Harry Potter and Narnia, especially when they departed January 2016 timeloop via ship. Which is a good thing. 6. The twins are serpents after all. I like their petrifying ability. 7. Am I expecting a sequel? Yes.

(Miss Peregrine was taken and that's why they didn't live in that loop anymore and the time on 3rd Sept,1943 went on. This should start a new timeline as when the loop was closed, they're not connected with the timeline of summer 2016 when Jake was with his dad in Cairnholm anymore. That's why Jake couldn't go back to his ""real"" time where he belonged. So, it should be 1943 and since Miss Avocet's loop was created on Jan 2016, the loop in in the carnival should have existed yet.) 2) The ending was confusing. If Jake went back to 1942 to join the Navy and wait til 1943 to catch up with the ship to meet Emma, then where would those children and the ship be between 1942-1943?",0,0,mrmvpvip,mAdpJw-MM-M,0.008080808080808077,2016-10-04 18:38:24,False,True

I went into this movie with no expections. I had seen no trailers. I went in completely blind, expecting Nanny McPhee with minorly superpowered kids. A cute fluffy film.  HOO BOY, WHERE TO BEGIN?  I didn't expect to enjoy this movie. The characters were charming, Miss Peregrine is just awesome, and the villains are hammy, yet appealing.  (The setting was just relatable to me, too. I'm biased, sue me.)  Didn't expect to see Samuel L. Jackson, because apparently I live under a rock. Good God he was hilarious. Watch the air scene, you'll see what I'm talking about. You can tell he's having the time of his life hamming it up and not giving a care.  The fantasy elements are great, and this is Tim Burton's best in awhile. (Heh, one look at an uninviting suburb full of offputting people with false smiles, and you know it's a Burton movie. There was even a shot where a bunch of relatives got all up in Jake's face acting waaaaay too happy to see him. It reminded me of Edward Scissorhands.)  The editing is a little jarring sometimes, but it's not distracting.  The main character is a little bland... but that's the point. He's ordinary, and that doesn't make the kid any less likable.   I DID NOT. EXPECT. EYE GORE. AND. SLENDERMEN. GIANT SLENDERMEN wearing carnations. I was so giddy and uncomfortable, and my friends were all cracking up.  Truly the best Slenderman movie that isn't even a Slenderman movie  I also loved the battle scene with the reanimated skeletons. Pirate skelebros vs Giant Slendermen. So cool.  So, yeah, a pretty fun movie. Not oscar material, but it piques my interest enough to go check out the books.

I also loved the imagery and the characters of the movie, too, despite some being different than the book (take Bronwyn, Emma, and Olive for example), and I love the fact that Tim Burton used the Twins in the series as well since they really showed off eye-candy to the movie's appeal.   Yes, this film is almost completely different than the book, but it doesn't ruin the story. All that Tim Burton did was take the original story and world of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and shape it into his own imagination.
