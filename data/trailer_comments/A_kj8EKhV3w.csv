Even The Day After Tomorrow was 10 years ago, and it even seemed outdated.   Another strange thing is that it only has a $50 million budget, and it's only 89 minutes long. Twister was 113 minutes long with a $92 million budget, and it was released in 1996. By seeing the trailer, and reading that it's shorter and cheaper than Twister, even in 2014, it doesn't seem very exciting. ",0,0,McIntosh1581,A_kj8EKhV3w,-0.1185416666666667,2014-08-08 05:59:18,False,True

2014-11-29T18:46:48,"Trash. I ran out of bad words to describe how bad this movie is. Absolutely pure D sh*t. I walked out of the theater and demanded my money back, told them I was robbed and insisted on a payment of $12,000 for wasting my time. The actors were idiotic. The local 6:00 PM TV station has better producers and actors. And the two Jackass flunkies who think it's really great fun to record and post Youtube death images from WWII German concentration camps? Make them experience starvation, disease and mindless torture. How about some cold body tests? It's well known that the camp doctors (fu*ksticks) would take a Russian POW or Jew outside during the cold winter of 1942/1943. They were stripped of their clothes, tied to a chair naked and every 30 minutes guards would cover them with a soaking wet sheet. Very few prisoners survived more than one night of this. The other prisoners were forced to listen to the horrifying screaming and moaning and begging for death. I imagine ol' red head tub of lard with the video camera probably laughed hysterically about this until his gut ached. Piggers. Animals.

2018-09-02T17:35:41,"OK, Who do I complain about this worthless piece of crap to?! Gosh this was awful! No plot!!! Heck I knew from the start who was going to get killed. I just picked them out. SURPRISE! They're dead. smh. Terrible! What Nimrod is going to stand there and look at the Tornado headed straight for them and scream, ""Oh GOD!"" You got that right now get out the way stupid! It's not like the Tornado is going to see you and suddenly move because you are in the way. It's a force of nature. The only thing you can do is get out of it's way. And if I hear the name, 'Tre' again, it will be too soon. :( My favorite tornado was the first one that casually came down the street. Then some idiot was outside the car saying, ""I gotta get this shot."" He got it all right along with his 3 friends. smh Anyone and I mean 'anyone' that have been in close proximity of an actual tornado knows that it's 100+ times worse then this crap. Hollywood never gets the sound right either. It sounds just like a 50's freight train, whistle, track against wheels and all. Heaven help you if you are in it's way. smh",0,0,D. R.
