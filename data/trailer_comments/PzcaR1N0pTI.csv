2018-03-05T02:43:52,"When I first heard about this I was excited however also saddened. I know there were seven books on Mary Poppins and I can easily understand why they wanted to make a sequel.. but for me - personally - it won't be the same without Julie Andrews. What she gave to the role was something magical that'll remain close to mine - and other peoples - hearts forever. I can't express how much the film meant to me and does. Of course they needed to use another actress, as Julie is getting old now and has lost her wonderful singing voice. Although half of me wishes they would have left it all alone and just stuck with the first one I am also half excited to see what this film will bring. If anyone - other than Julie - was to play Mary Poppins, I am glad they picked Emily Blunt: she is a national treasure and her singing voice is lovely to hear: I am looking forward to what Emily has in store :)  Plus: Freaking out that Angela Lansbury will appear in this! :D",0,0,Loopy Lyds,PzcaR1N0pTI,0.27625,2018-03-05 02:43:52,True,True

2018-03-05T15:49:35,"It must have been a real treat to have watched the original Mary Poppins, starring the incomparable Julie Andrews and her co-star Dick Van Dyke, in 1963. It was the first live-action animated feature from Disney, in colour. Probably most households in Britain still did not have a television in 1963. And if there was a television, it would have been a black-and-white. What matters is the characterisation in a movie more than anything else. It's the characterisation that gives a movie its particular charm. Mary Poppins the movie, so fun, colourful and imaginative, had a long run in cinemas in America. It was made in America; the great songs in it were conceived in America; the movie was extremely popular: it captured the imagination!!!!  America gets a bad rap in the press every week these days. Seemingly Americans do. But without America and the American spirit, the world, the young, middle-aged and elderly, would scarcely be charmed or entertained at all. Could Mary Poppins the movie have sprung from somewhere else? Perhaps Britain (the author was Australian/British). The reality is the movie itself could not have sprung from anywhere else, in the 60s, not even from Canada next door let alone from anywhere in another continent. The world needs this kind of entertainment. Obviously the world still looks to America. When the channels were few, entertainment was dominating the airwaves. Now there's too much crass, nasty stuff going on in the world. I hope the sequel enthrals audiences as much as the original from 55 years ago!",0,5,Dustshoe,PzcaR1N0pTI,0.20480072463768115,2018-03-05 15:49:35,True,True

I can feel it constricting trying to go back into my girlfriends ass. I fight the urge to vomit all over her back and begin to pull it out her ass. Its fucking 5 feet long.  My girlfriend says ""why'd you stop"" she turns around and sees this 5 foot long tape worm covered in shit coming out of her ass. She then starts to have a panic attack and starts to vomit this white sludge that smells god awful.  Her parents storm in excepting us to be doing homework or something. Her mother faints and falls forward and lands on the white vomit pile building up on the ground. Her dad almost pukes, but then is able to call 911. Mother wakes up just to vomit all over the floor.

2018-03-05T21:29:19,"I don't suppose Disney could just leave well enough alone for once? I get it, creativity is hard and some good movies truly do deserve sequels, but really? First Pirates of the Caribbean with two movies too many, then Star Wars, and now Mary Poppins. Some stories should just end at a certain place and time, and to drag them out any longer would just cheapen and ruin them. Mary Poppins is one of those movies, and while perhaps it is unfair to judge a book by it's cover (or a movie by it's trailer, to be more accurate), Disney has a bad track record when it comes to judging these sorts of things. Anyone ever heard of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility? It's an economic principle that dictates that after a certain point more does not equal better, and that every additional unit of the good or service in question acquired has less value to the consumer than it's predecessors. This applies to movies and sequels too, but Disney doesn't seem to have caught on to that yet, and now Mary Poppins seems to be the next casualty in their neverending quest for profit by quantity and not quality.",0,0,Peter Yoble,PzcaR1N0pTI,0.1536967418546366,2018-03-05 21:29:19,True,True

2018-03-05T21:30:01,"Dear friends you may feel lonely and lost in this big world, but just know you are NEVER alone. Jesus Christ always have been and will always be with you on this earth. He is all around you, hovering over you even as you seek Him. He is nearer than you dare believe, closer than the air you breathe. If His children could only recognize His presence, they would never feel lonely again. Jesus knows every thought before you think it, every word before you speak it. His presence impinges on your innermost being. Can you see the absurdity of trying to hide anything from Him? You can easily deceive other people, and even yourself; but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whom loves you so much, can read you like an open book, large print.                                                                                                            Deep within themselves, most people have some awareness of Jesus imminent presence. Many people run from Him and vehemently deny His existence, because the closeness of Jesus terrifies them. But His own children have nothing to fear, for Jesus Christ have cleansed them by His blood and clothed them in His righteousness. Be blessed by His intimate nearness. Since Jesus lives in you, let Him also live through you, shining LIGHT into darkness. Become one with Christ by telling Him you will give you life to Him this very moment. Repent and as Him to forgive you of your sins. Believe in Him, have Faith in Him and allow Him to lead and guide you in EVERY aspect of your life. Jesus Christ's love for you can't be measured or described using mere words. It is deep, eternal, and special just for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (Psalm 139:1-4;  Ephesians 2:13;  2 Corinthians 5:21)",0,0,msdogooder,PzcaR1N0pTI,0.16267264481550198,2018-03-05 21:30:01,True,True

It‚Äôs like the idiot that made a Willy Wonka remake by not calling it Willy Wonka but instead Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and made Charlie a bit of a freak. Is it that no one at Disney can come up with a new story to tell, that they have to keep rehashing the same movies over and over squeezing little kids parents wallets. I‚Äôm going to say this and believe me, the natural fluidity of the original can never be matched and I believe it will be easily seen in the rehashed version.

You have some of the best writers and directors and support teams and staff ever assembled in the history of movie making and they can stand tall on their own feet.  Let your creators shine.  They have their own stories to tell the world.  If you devote so much time and resources to revisiting the past you will miss out on making the classics of the next generation.

My mom, Neringa Venckienƒó, a former Lithuanian judge and Parliament member, fled Lithuania with me from political persecution, and we arrived in the U.S.A. in 2013 when I was just 13-years-old. As my mom filed for and has been waiting here for a political asylum hearing to take place, I became more hopeful and at ease because I was not afraid for her safety or mine anymore as was a daily reality back in Lithuania where my uncle (my mom‚Äôs brother) was murdered because he was trying to expose pedophiles among high-ranking Lithuanian officials who molested his daughter Deimantƒó. My mom became a target after she publicly started speaking about the bribery and corruption in the Lithuanian courts, the government and its media did not succeed in intimidating her. My 8-year- old cousin Deimantƒó, whose father was murdered, was abducted by government forces from my mother‚Äôs care. My mother was her legally appointed guardian at that time. The government called it ‚Äúa child‚Äôs return to her mother operation,‚Äù but that was actually an elimination of an inconvenient witness operation with the help of 240 special forces and the intimidation of everyone in Lithuania who sought the truth in the pedophilia and murder case (more people were murdered in this case than just my uncle). My cousin was returned to the person she was testifying against. I was really scared and could not even imagine what is going to happen to Deimantƒó.  To stop the anti-corruption and truth movement, government forces had to eliminate my mom because she was not intimidated. The Lithuanian people elected her to Parliament to fight against corruption and to seek the truth. She proposed many laws among which there was stricter punishment for pedophiles, but all of them were blocked by the dominant parties in Parliament. When the prosecutors brought charges against my mom, all of her opponents announced that they'll support the removal of her legal immunity, before the investigation took place.

We did not have ""Media on demand"" at our fingertips back then or even cable TV, only Cinema (By Bus, Car or Foot) or TV (by an Antenna stuck on the roof). I can still recall my granddad with the ladder up on the roof, on top of one of the chimneys (we heated with coal, back then) trying to position the thing in order to get a good signal, on the tiny color TV. No big screen back then, or tablets.  Now, 50 plus years later, after watching this teaser and getting tiny little goosebumps, I will reserve judgement until I see the MOVIE!  It was that Kite.....  With tuppence for paper and strings You can have your own set of wings With your feet on the ground, you're a bird in flight With your fist holding tight To the string of your kite  Oh, let's go fly a kite Up to the highest height Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring Up through the atmosphere Up where the air is clear Oh, let's go fly a kite  When you send it flyin' up there All at once you're lighter than air You can dance on the breeze Over Alpses and trees With your fist holdin' tight To the string of your kite  Oh, let's go fly a kite Up to the highest height Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring Up through the atmosphere Up where the air is clear Oh, let's go fly a kite",0,0,Brett Brown,PzcaR1N0pTI,0.17438822751322755,2018-03-06 19:32:13,True,True

Movies that based on something that already exist, ""Part 2"" movies, remakes or computer animation movies because Japan is the only country that know how to make ""trick"" movies. Disney forget it for years, that is realy sad. I wish we ged a time like the 90ts, or the 2000ts. a time were we get one new movie after another. Everything is new and make with work and love. Where we go in a theater and dont know what we saw. Something new. A new trick movie from the dream factory Disney. Who remember the time when we saw the Lion King or Hercules in the theater? I do.  and now? ""Wow, another animation movie from Disney. Wow, the 5 part of a movie. That is so new. Wow another animation movie with animals. Wow a real life remake of a old trick movie from Disney. How resourceful.""  I hope we get a time again where the big movie makers make something new again. Something that is so creative and new that something like this never exist befor. No remake, no ""Part 2, 3, 4, ,5 ,6 and so on"", no animation crap (movies like this exist more then anouth).  i want a real Disney movie again. Something like Lion King, like Aladdin, like Mulan.

2018-12-07T00:48:55,"The Mary Poppins of the book is nothing like the Mary Poppins of the film. She's a commoner, calling all birds 'sparrers' and spouting off other working class turns of phrase. The books are a bit Lewis Carrollesque in that the structure barely matters -The movie and the play are both unwatchable and the books are unreadable. She's a cruel, heartless, mean-spirited woman who threatens to call the police on kids for the heinous crime of not being sleepy, and when Disney tried to balance that out by giving her a sappy side, she just got watered down. Meanwhile, the songs in the movie are fucking annoying and have bad messages (sexism, encouraging kids to take sugar with medicine) and I can't believe one of them won an Oscar.     Then there was the battle between Walt Disney and author  (Saving Mr. Banks (2013)  financially strapped author Pamela ""P. L."" Travers reluctantly travels from her home in London to Los Angeles to work with Walt Disney at the urging of her agent, Diarmuid Russell. Disney has pursued the film rights to her Mary Poppins stories for twenty years, having promised his daughters that he would produce a film based on them. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts because she fears what he would do to her character. However, she has not written anything in a while and her book royalties have dwindled to nothing, so she risks losing her house. Still, Russell has to remind her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations‚Äîno animation and unprecedented script approval. Walt Disney lied to GTravers, stole her concept,  and then did not even have the decency to invite TRavers to the opening. Travers had to crash the party so to speak.    So, now (2018) we have yet another remake of this tragic episode in which the film is even worse than the original with one exception, Travers is long dead and gone and not around to see how Disney has even more severely trashed this story for $$$$.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzcaR1N0pTI",1,0,Kilburn Hall,PzcaR1N0pTI,-0.13706597222222222,2018-12-07 00:48:55,True,True
