2018-08-06T02:38:13,"Wow I finally got around to watch this movie and I thought it was terrible. The story was so corny and overly dramatic. It tries way to hard to be a suspenseful and thrilling movie. One movie I love that it reminded me of was Fincher's The Game from 1997 with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn which I think is a near masterpiece. I know I'm in the minority here and I haven't felt this way about a movie in a long time. I'm actually very accepting of most movies and can see the good in all of them. The acting was great in this, the lighting, cinematography, and the overall tone was beautifully rendered by the extremely talented Fincher, the music by Reznor and mood it created was my favorite part, but the story is so agonizingly and incredibly pretentious. I think this movie was just not for me. I feel like I would dislike the writer's books most of all. The story feels like it appeals to housewives and single middle aged women. I can't stand stories or movies that have ridiculous twists and say; ""You think you know what's going to happen now? Oh yeah? Watch this."". It's just a cheap rollercoaster ride. It seems that's why a lot of people like this film because it's a film that did a book justice and got it ""right"". Which obviously doesn't happen often except with Fincher. I wonder what percentage of people who watch this read the book before? That's a fantastic feat, but it's not enough for me to love the film. I'm a 38 year old single male so I can see myself fitting into the one category that just couldn't relate or find interest in this movie. It would be interesting to see if anyone else feels this way and if they are in the same demographic. I'm happy the film did well and writers can make money from their stories but this one just wasn't for me. And to be honest I'm so surprised because I thought I would love it.",4,2,Thomas Rainbow,2-_-1nJf8Vg,0.16824473975636764,2018-08-06 02:38:13,False,False
