No one really jumps out in trailer but it's just a trailer.  Fassbender and even the song may hint that Scott's big focus is David, which will be interesting, but only if as a component of the alien civilization. He seems like a renegade from the Blade Runner world, maybe a bridge between these series? I'm not sure what's great about making David somehow involved in getting us to the derelict in the original--it makes the derelict in ALIEN a piece of human/Earth-related space junk instead of a completely alien object. Having space jockey be a suit over a much less-interesting humanoid alien--why was that such a great idea?

2016-12-25T10:47:43,"In the beginning of 2015, when it was unclear whether the proposed sequel to Prometheus would be green-lit, writer/director Neill Blomkamp announced that he and actress Sigourney Weaver had been secretly working on an Alien sequel, with Ridley Scott producing. This film (working title Untitled Neill Blomkamp/Alien Project) is meant to be an alternative sequel to Aliens, which establishes a different timeline and basically ignores the events of Alien¬≥ and Alien: Resurrection. After public approval, the film was green-lit shortly thereafter. However, at the end of 2015, it was announced that the studio had decided to develop Ridley Scott's Prometheus-sequel Alien: Covenant first. Blomkamp was asked to alter his screenplay as to not clash with Scott's story, and postpone his project indefinitely while Scott was working on Alien: Covenant and its intended sequel. Even though Blomkamp's project is still listed as under development, the film and Blomkamp's own involvement in it have become unsure. Sigourney Weaver is slated to appear in three Avatar sequels between 2018 and 2022, which could cause additional delays for the proposed Alien sequel. Blomkamp has indicated that he wants to pursue other projects in the meanwhile, and may no longer be available if it ever gets made.",48,3,Nick,H0VW6sg50Pk,-0.023214285714285705,2016-12-25 10:47:43,True,True

Still, they shouldn't have shown the pods and the spore clips. But I am curious how the ecosystem on this planet was created and how it works. + Michael Fassbender will play two Androids: David and Walter. + I get the feeling that David will play a very antagonistic role in the film. + The sets look great. + The egg and the facehugger look very organic and not CGI. + The Alien is back. I am still curious what its look will be. + I am curious about the Neomorph, especially when it is gown up. + I am curious how the Engineers will appear in the film.  The bad: - I don't quite like the music in this trailer, especially the song. The music for the Prometheus trailer was far better in my opinion. - Apparently, the pods release spores which enter the human body through the ears. When you're on a foreign planet, wear a spacesuit with a helmet.  When I watched the trailer for the first time I had the feeling I was watching some kind of cheap horror film.

2016-12-25T11:02:14,"For anyone confused on what exactly this film is about; this is a direct sequel to Prometheus/prequel to Alien. The film follows an expedition to the far reaches of the galaxy aboard the colony ship Covenant. The planet which they discover comes across as a hidden utopia until they uncover the Engineer ship and the synthetic David (who is supposedly the only survivor from Prometheus). From what we can gather David has been playing god, developing the goo further into air-borne spores and more dangerous organisms (face-huggers, xenomorphs etc.) I imagine there will be some conflict between Walter (the new synthetic also played by Michael Fassbender) and David when it comes down to their differing ideologies (synthetics typically favour the xeno's as the perfect organism - Walter may be more inclined to his crew).  TLDR: This is a direct sequel to Prometheus, including elements of the first film - but progressing to be more familiar to the original quadrilogy in terms of what we can expect (xenomorphs).",1,0,TempestSlayer,H0VW6sg50Pk,0.12237373737373738,2016-12-25 11:02:14,True,True

All we know so far is... there will be an Alien - which is awesome! ^^ - and there will be people who have to deal with it.  HOWEVER, the story of Prometheus (which was also great) will continue most likely. We will know more about David, what happend to Shaw, probably more about the Engineers, maybe their homeland and hopefully a bit more about their amazingly dangerous (but also very potent) substance - ""the black goo"".   AND let's not forget! Ridley Scott said there will be 3 Sequels to Prometheus (which is basically ""Alien 0"") with the last of these sequels, Nr. 3, leading into the very first Alien movie. So it will be like:   - Alien prequel movie 0 (known as Prometheus, introducing the alien universe: the Space Jockeys, Weyland Yutani Corp/Peter Weyland himself and his motivations, Androids, and certain incidents that ""may"" have lead to the creation of the ""alien species"")  - Alien prequel movie 1 (>> which is Alien Covenant <<) - Alien prequel movie 2 (>> title yet unknown <<) - Alien prequel movie 3 (>> title yet unknown >> BUT, according to Scott THIS will be the movie that leads directly into first Alien from 1979).   So, let's just wait and see what Alien Covenant is all about, before you all jump to conclusions AND don't forget, there will be 2 more movies coming out and fleshing out the ""prequel trilogy"", BUT most importantly: let's be happy and thankfull that we all will get a real ""Alien Movie"" made by Ridley Scott himself! :)",16,1,fuckyou7037,H0VW6sg50Pk,0.1462561413454271,2016-12-25 12:00:37,True,True

2016-12-25T16:21:50,"Been excited about this movie. However, nothing in this trailer got me excited. Really, it just looked plain old average. Another new, boring, unprepared crew, who encounter an Alien. Look. You have rights to the single greatest fictional horror creature ever created yet the genius writers and producers at Hollywood can't seem to come up with an original movie. Maybe in thirty years we'll have some better Alien material. The franchise have been a jumbled joke since Alien 3. I don't think this movie will be bad, but I don't see it being great either. You can't re-do an ""Alien"" movie. It isn't the 1970's, the Alien creature is no longer a new, edgy concept anymore (nor surprising - we know they chest burst, we know what they are now), and the cinema viewer of 2016 is not as naive as the cinema viewer of 1979. You have to understand that fact and adapt. Hollywood never adapts, they just force-feed people the same rehash. They succeed in making money because there simply is no real alternative for the people. They monopolize the film industry. It's like fashion: you buy what is out there, and what is out there is what is ""in"".  And yes, I'm aware this is a Prometheus prequel of sorts, taking place pre-Alien, and not a straight Alien remake. But who are you kidding?

While that sounds kind of dumb, for fans of the original two movies this is fantastic news as Alien 5 is set to wipe away Alien 3 and Resurrection. Alien 5 is set to continue where Alien 2 left off, with Ripley, Newt and CPL Hicks asleep in their cryo pods...so there you go. Educate yourselves before you complain about this awesome series.

If you're not familiar with the behind the scenes stuff, then this trailer would be quite confusing, especially seeing Fassbender with a different crew - that's because it's not David, but another Android.  David is the man in the cloak shown later in the trailer and by the looks of things, he's been a very naughty robot.  There will be engineers and Shaw will return, but most likely in a small cameo.  The planet in this trailer is the Engineer's homeworld.  The Engineer ship discovered by the Covenant crew in the trailer is the same ship Shaw and David used to escape LV-223 at the end of Prometheus.  Obviously, something went wrong because there's an alien egg on the ship, and it looks as though David has coaxed one of the Covenant members to investigate it knowing what the outcome will be (David's in the background of that shot).

FYI You are not looking at the finished product and not even close, we saw no engineers or shaw and david (and we know they will appear on screen), there's a hint of xenomorph and the derelict/eggs.

It was weeks before I was able to eat normally again.  And even the slightest glimpse of the Alien trailer, after it was syndicated to television would put me into a traumatic depression for years to come.  A likening to what I felt has been captured in the SCORN trailer.  (Very GIGER).  In the original Alien, the atmosphere was like a dreamy nightmare.  It was cold, dirty, & gritty.  From the beginning, the crew were already on edge and the atmosphere was tense.  They were regular people with regular jobs.  They were of different ages - (unlike the ""cool"" 20 somethings you see in every movie today)  They resonated with me because those people were like my neighbors or my family - It added to the horror, the feeling  that no one could keep me safe.

Originally his script was very dark and gory.. More Alien in tone than giant blue men.. Spaights Script introduced Gen 1 hybrid xenos with a brand new life cycle.. He goes way more in depth on the Commentary Promethus blu ray. But Ridely opted out to use Damon lindeloffs ideas more than Johns.. About Gods and Creation.

All we know so far is... there will be an  Alien - which is awesome! ^^ - and there will be people who have to deal  with it.  HOWEVER, the story of Prometheus (very good one) will continue most  likely. We'll  learn more about David, what happend to Shaw, probably  more about the Engineers themselves, maybe their homeland and hopefully a  bit more about their amazingly dangerous (but also very potent)  substance - ""the black goo"".   AND let's not forget! Ridley Scott said there will be 3 Sequels to  Prometheus (which is basically ""Alien 0"") with the last of these  sequels, Nr. 3, leading into the very first Alien movie. So it will be  like:   - Alien prequel movie 0 (known as Prometheus, introducing the alien  universe: the Space Jockeys, Weyland Yutani Corp/Peter Weyland himself  and his motivations, Androids, and certain incidents that ""may"" have  lead to the creation of the ""alien species"")  - Alien prequel movie 1 (>> which is Alien Covenant <<) - Alien prequel movie 2 (>> title yet unknown <<) - Alien prequel movie 3 (>> title yet unknown >> BUT,  according to Scott THIS will be the movie that leads directly into first  Alien from 1979).   So, let's just wait and see what Alien Covenant is all about, before you  all jump to conclusions AND don't forget, there will be 2 more movies  coming and fleshing out the ""prequel trilogy"", BUT most importantly:  let's be happy and thankfull that we all  get a new amazing Sci-Fi movie  made by Ridley Scott himself! :)",96,6,fuckyou7037,H0VW6sg50Pk,0.1769272458807343,2016-12-26 02:54:53,True,True

2016-12-26T04:11:07,"I remember reading what was supposedly a leaked early script of Alien 3 in which the survivors of Aliens arrive on a space station and the alien turns out to be an infectious lifeform that mutates people into aliens. I remember thinking that was the biggest betrayal you could give to the franchise that gave us both one of the greatest horror films and one of the greatest action sci-fi's ever. Turning the xenomorph into John Carptenter's The Thing what the hell were they thinking?  Then I watched Prometheus and I went ""Oh, they kept that idea. Jesus Christ, talk about having no idea what makes your franchise memorable."" And now we have Alien Covenant which seems to have no only dropped the GOOD aspects of Prometheus but kept the awful ones and crammed it into a proper Alien film just in case anyone had some hope that the two would become separate concepts. You thought maybe the Alien as an icon of horror and science-fiction and indeed the film industry as a whole would somehow survive this desperate attempt to break and twist it into something utterly unrecognizable, but nope, here's Alien Covenant to really twist that last nail into the coffin and make the argument clear that for whatever reason Ridley Scott has developed a massive inferiority complex concerning John Carpenter's suspense masterpiece and is going to spend an entire trilogy of films mutilating the franchise he created into a pretentious Thing ripoff.

2016-12-26T06:15:56,"I have a theory on how Prometheus and Alien: Covenant are tied together. The Alien franchise has a history of having the xenomorph sneak onto an escape ship without the crew/escapee knowing. At the end of Prometheus we see a new xenomorph being born from the engineer that was infected by the extremely large face hugger. What if that same xenomorph was able to unknowingly sneak into Shaw's ship when she escaped? It is entirely possible given the precedent set forth in prior films. I think it did, I think it also badly injured Shaw and impregnated her and she birthed either the first classic xenomorph from all the original films, or a queen xenomorph. I think this causes her ship to crash on the planet that Alien: Covenant takes place on. I also think that David, or David's head rather, whom she took with her was able to send out some kind of signal to the Weyland company alerting them to their location. The Weyland company sends out this crew to investigate what happened in the guise of an ""expedition"" to find a suitable planet for colonization. We see another functioning David android as part of the crew in the trailer, which leads me to believe this is the case. The crew is unknowingly lead right to this and then all hell breaks loose. That's what I'm thinking is the plot.",1,3,the terrible gamer,H0VW6sg50Pk,0.11395040145040146,2016-12-26 06:15:56,True,True

God forbid a trailer not spell out a film and plot (which has become commonplace in Hollywood recently).  There have also been disagreements about how there should be a 'Giger' inspired landscape.  What's wrong with something new?  Ridley knows that his creation has been played out and wants to deliver something more intriguing and expand on the universe.  I think Fox (along with Ridley) listened when he saw how polarizing Prometheus was.    Alien: Covenant is a sequel to Prometheus, but he's decided not to run a story that branches off on its own path in the same 'alienverse'.  He wants a direct lead in to the events of 'Alien'.  Answer the who and why.  I'm particularly interested in Weyland-Yutani's obsession with the xeno.

If this colony ship, the Covenant, is traveling to a very far off planet on the other side of the galaxy which has to be farther off than LV-223 in 'Prometheus' who's to say that this ship didn't set sail before the Prometheus? Other side of the galaxy (from the movie description) has to be a lot farther off than LV-223. Let's say it's 6 or 7 and maybe even 10 times farther off than LV-223. That could be at least 20 years travel which would place the ships departure ten years before the Prometheus.

Ridley did a great job as directing also without cgi everything looks real and terrorizing. In Prometheus the idea was great but its execution is not. The actors besides Fassbender also mostly wrong choices. But anyway its not a bad movie at all. ƒ∞t gives great ideas to follow up. ƒ∞f Ridley can mix stregth of charcters like in Alien 1 suspense and horror also with the great ideas of Prometh. Alien covenent can be greatest of all time. But if he tries cheesy colonial marines type of thing it will be a major blow. We need the big Boy ridley. Who is the big boy?

They returned with a powerful bio weapon but once again were  demolished. The only survivor in hibernation. Predators now armed with  advance tech open bio weapon and make it their new pet and punching bag.  Engineers see that go down and run for the hills. Predators pursue them  and stumble across humanity still in the stone age. They saw themselves  in us and taught us in the same way that they learnt hence backstory  for AVP. Humans gained knowledge about the planet from its original  natives the predators who since moved on. The surviving engineer may not  have seen a human before and thought us to be a race of predator, going  into panic and trying to kill everyone because of it.   While the script may have changed for legal reasons this was probably the original idea.

Throw risky curves, even off tech jumps for some ships like promethous, But remember where it all came from, where it's brand was made immortal. Never replace and undo it like so many other franchises. Always remember that second movie and always honor it's existence in the timeline.   You've been warned.

2017-02-10T20:55:24,"It's amazing how fans are complaining AGAIN. The biggest criticism of Prometheus was the lack of xenomorphs. Aside from the confusing storylines, Prometheus was a good movie and an intro to the entire Xenomorph storyline. This IS the sequel to Prometheus and part of a prequel trilogy that will lead to the events of the original Alien movie. Once you understand this it all makes sense. Yes, the captain does stand curious as the egg opens up but SO DID CAIN in the original Alien. For the brief second between the egg opening and the launch of the facehugger there is no time for deliberation or ""maybe this is dangerous"", it all happens to fast. And for those complaining of the goofiness of the shower scene, the tail is meant as a sexual/phalic conotation AGAIN displayed in the original Alien with Lambert. We all complained that Prometheus wasn't a true prequal so Ridley redirected the story back to the events of Alien. Shouldn't we be salivating some Alien juice for this movie! It brings Alien back to legitimate, quality movie making - so that we can forget the horrendous Alien Resurrection comedy and those ahem Alien / Predator made for tv fluff movies. This is going to be an amazing return to Xeno land. It's the movie we've waited for.",0,0,Davie27,H0VW6sg50Pk,0.004326923076923079,2017-02-10 20:55:24,True,True

The story starts with this ship of colonists picking up a distress signal (which I believe was probably activated by Shaw) on this planet so they stop to investigate. Don't forget, at the end of Prometheus they were en route for the Engineers homeworld so this is probably that world they were talking about therefor there probably will be more Engineer story development. Plus, this movie has the original android David in it along with the new one (I believe his name is Walter) so there is another link between Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. I have full faith that the Prometheus story we saw is going to be developped further in this movie but with aliens now in the picture. It`s confirmed that there are TWO different aliens in this movie. The classic Xenomorph, and the new Neomorphs. I speculate that the Neomorph is the one bursting out the back that infects through the ear. We`ll see somehow at some point how the Xenomorph gets introduced.

2017-05-03T19:10:51,"Origins - Darwinism and DNA  I recently watched a video in which Neil deGrasse Tyson talked about Darwin and DNA diversity. In the video Tyson stated that the human embryo has gills that develop into the inner ear later on in the development of the fetus.  Does all life have gills present in the embryonic stage? If not can the lineage of such animals that develop without gills be traced back to an area when evolutionary change would have determined that life no longer needed gills to breathe? Life that developed in space on the way to Earth could have developed gills inside of the shell to help assist in development. Life developing in this manner though would have taken a very long time to develop as its need to roam a planet had not yet been established. A stasis if you will.   Also since all life is contained in a fluid in the womb then life would have arrived on Earth in a similar type of fluid to that of the embryonic sack.   Since all animals need water, except for a few who live in acidic water, then life would have come to Earth encapsulated in shells of water with some sort of embryonic fluid protecting the developing life.The embryo would then have used the water shell as a source of nutrients that it would also use to gather microbial carbon dust bits as it traveled through space and eventually to Earth.  Since water has been determined to be older than the Earth and that life would not have survived the Earth during its very hot years of forming, a model of the Earth when it first began to too cool to the point of allowing frozen water to slowly melt would be a good start to determine when life was seeded on Earth.   If life in the modern world that does not develop gills during the embryonic development phase but has so in its lineage during prehistoric times then we can trace the evolution of life on Earth to a point of origins in space as well possibly creating a link between all species that would communicate somehow that we were on Earth and no longer needed gills during the development stage. Gills that suggest that primordial life at one time was sentient in the womb and thought for itself and needed to breathe the womb fluid until the umbilical cord of the mother was later introduced when the first male and female species mated and had offspring.  Life on Earth would not have had the prerequisites for gills once the water melted on Earth containing the embryo's. Life that came to Earth must therefore have developed gills as a means of breathing while on the way to Earth.   It would need to be determined at what rate ice would melt but not melt enough to expose the embryonic sack inside but allowed the embryo once on Earth to seed its DNA, for plants, in the ground and at what rate the ice would melt that would then allow the life inside to walk the Earth.",0,1,Dryson Bennington,H0VW6sg50Pk,0.0681622678396872,2017-05-03 19:10:51,True,True

2017-05-25T11:20:43,"This is, basically, the sequel to Ridley Scott's prior film _Promethius_ and manages to finally answer such questions as who created the alien monsters in that and the earlier _Alien_ films, which are actually a highly advanced biological weapon capable of destroying all nonbotanical lifeforms on a planet,  and what happened to them.  This film, like _Promethius_, involves a declining humanity's attempt to find a new world to colonize while speculating about where humanity came from and what its destiny will be.  Much of the action is catalyzed by the sinister, human despising android ""David"" who reappears in this film and continues his efforts to assist in the demise of humanity.  Like the prior films, there is much darkness, dampness, and blood splattering attacks by the alien creatures.  This time, however, they even seem immune to bullets.  The space scenes look realistic and there is much action.  All of the standard plot elements are redone in this film and the overall plot is mildly interesting.  They even threw in a bit of surprise ending not seen before.  However, I found _Promethius_ to be a more interesting film because of its plot, but this one is an adequate sequel and worth viewing, imo.   If one is new to these Ridley Scott films, he may be surprised at how different they appear from the usual _Star Trek_ films.  There is no Federation of Planets, no vast wars raging in space, no teleporters, and no phasor guns.  The spacecraft are hulking masses of metal propelled through space by glowing thrusters in their trailing ends and there is only some vague mentioning of making ""jumps"" through space.  Trips to distant star systems are not completed in days, but, rather, require years during which the astronauts, future colonists aboard the spaceship ""Covenant"" in this film, must sleep with greatly lowered metabolisms in special hibernation tubes.  By the standards of the ST films, the technological view of the future this film and its antecedents present is somewhat primitive.

2018-07-07T09:10:58,"I read from a half year ago an article about yet another interpretation of the prequels and in it was said that the engineers from Prometheus did not create people at all, that just like people were also created by someone else. The ""creators"" distributed humanoids on different planets where there was a need to interfere in atmospheric conditions (in the case of people, biblical catastrophes, floods, etc.). The prometheus' humanoids developed the most and reached the creators, curious engineers destroyed their ""Gods"" and took over their name (does not it remind something?). If they saw competition in other ""humanoids"" - they destroyed them (they saw it in people), while the less developed ones that they saw in the gods left alive (engineers from covenat). Just history is coming round. It's nice if Ridley used something, I hope that at least he can do one movie and close the buckle, these two films may gain on continuation. Then move the action 500 years into the future (in the end of the prequels leave an open gate - there are more spaces after the egg galaxy), completely ""detach"" from previous movies and just do a two-hour closed story, not some new trilogies, only different films, various director's visions, different interpretations with strangers in the background.

Scott probably himself has some lame explanation like resource scarcity in the future has made tech poor or something similar, which won't save these new movies to feel completely disconnected from the alien saga. At least in aliens the tech advances were explained by Ripley being marooned in space for 60 years in stasis..

As you know cute space guy leaves earth with sum chic n whomever they go prepared n then they encounter alien freaks...‚Ä¶...you thought that was the end right well nope they had aliens long before that n they were still current when spaceboy left his earth n of course they were conquering planets n killing off whatever they saw as a mutated mecha disgusting beings created and of course could change to a human fooling anyone and doing anything they wanted that was extremely gorey which is another reason why spaceboy left his homeworld otherwise that earth of his would've been the last of its kind because it was bigger than a life or death matter and why you see his spaceship get changed n look a lot more upgraded because the battle was far more intense with each difficulty he came across besides I was playing this game n I was like if this was more like a PlayStation 4 type of game you'd be extremely determined n curious to go even farther through that game eventually u see spaceboy go up against the big boss no one in their brain cell can get to that friggin boss its the hardest boss to come across but ur playing mr spaceboy n trust me he has the skills to kill it off its just that the boss is extremely hard to kill...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..lemme guess you've killed the boss n think its oh u poor silly miserable little peeps that was nowhere near the final boss it was just the beginning as you know there are several of the game that involves spaceboy shooting down aliens it turned into an insane ass chronicle don't believe me? that's m k cause back in the day I found out that there was more than 1 and spaceboy was extremely skilled enough to get past all those aliens n monsters mind u it was only 1 guy in that ship and hes the same guy and only that 1 guy u could use everytime u had to start all over again.

2020-05-03T22:18:13,"Fucking hell! This one‚Äôs sooo bad, one wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin, where to end! It‚Äôs as if completely another director made it, just as the screenplay was made by other, complete idiots!     But in short‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs start with the writing! Given that for a film like Alien, one has its basis (more or less, although, after the ingenuity of Prometheus, that shouldn‚Äôt have been so simple, but they went for the secure option, and made it as predictable as it gets), and then you simply work/adjust the events on it, depending on how you want it to be, and in which direction you want the story to go. So that‚Äôs the basis! And as we‚Äôve said, they went for the simplest possible, just to follow (accidentally, by getting an ‚Äúunknown & unexpected‚Äù signal) the most predictable turn of events of the characters of the previous film, and attached that to everything else connected with this franchise!   Then, the most important thing in writing ‚Äì terrible character creation and development. So, instead of the well thought, proper characters, like we had in the 1st film, we‚Äôve ended up with an American Hollywood bullshit, political correctness‚Ä¶ couples, to make male & female roles (at least) equal, then, an accidental captain who‚Äôs so insecure in himself as a leader, other crew members who look more like a sitcom characters, than a space ship crew, and of course, there‚Äôs a stubborn female strong character who will oppose the captain in his decision (are you fucking with me?), a guy, mainly ‚Äúthe driver‚Äù of the ship, with the cowboy hat, etc, etc‚Ä¶ in so many words, guys out of whom none looks like they belong there, or know even what they‚Äôre doing in those roles, even if they were shoved in their throats by force!     Afterwards, when the crew lands on the planet, although they‚Äôre 10 years after Prometheus, they look like they‚Äôre 100 years technically behind, and just pay attention to how they explore the new planet, how they find the ship (the engineers ship, used y Elizabeth Shaw and David), even visually, I can‚Äôt understand how Ridley could‚Äôve make it so bad and everything but impressive, and how they get infected‚Ä¶ ( And there were people who were complaining about how the biologist got infected in Prometheus?!?!?!) With the grand finale, how they get the first infected on the ship, where a completely incompetent crew member (and no less, but the one who was driving the capsule, or the smaller ship, or whatever the fuck it was‚Ä¶ who panics like a housewife who would panic if you take her to her first mountain camping, where she‚Äôd see a bigger insect than a fly, for the first time in her life! So what does she do? She blows up the ship away with her totally incompetent reacting to the sick crewmate!!!    I mean‚Ä¶ do I need to go on saying why this film was such a disappointment after Prometheus? I don‚Äôt think so‚Ä¶  I‚Äôll just add that in the 2d part, when David gets back in the picture, things start turning into a (juuust a little) bit better direction. But that hardly makes up for all the damage it was done previously, in a sense of giving this film at least a decent grade (YOU CAN‚ÄôT!!!) overall speaking!     So, let‚Äôs just hope that Ridley would be capable of giving us a truly good film in the 3 prequel,  written professionally, concentrate the story on the Engineers way more (‚Äòcause obviously, the Alien story must come form them), great, smart story, with proper characters, excellent lines, and the right casting, like in the 1st film, not this shit!",0,0,Shteno,H0VW6sg50Pk,0.008380058811802238,2020-05-03 22:18:13,False,False
