2015-01-20T07:03:18,I swear this was the lamest movie I've ever watched. I was so disappointed with how all the characters act.. Especially with Drew and Adam. They both act so... scripted.. I wanted to laugh with all the jokes but they were just so lame. Maybe it was really the script (they practically had the dullest script ever btw) or the director or.. I don't know I just.. I guess I expected something more..   Rating: 4/10,3,3,Patricia Ann,8MuWt2X59fo,-0.049999999999999996,2015-01-20 07:03:18,False,False

2015-10-19T09:10:23,"The movie, altogether, was a happy and good one. It has a good ending! However, it was not as good as ""50 First Dates"" or ""The Wedding Singer,"" i.e. 2 other movies Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler co-starred in. I like those movies way more because he is actually sweet her in those movies. In this movie, NOT so much :(  From this movie, I really liked that Lauren is a good, caring mom who is sweet to her two boys, She tries to be there for them in every way possible and make them happy with all she can. I liked that Lauren had such a great coworker, who was also a best friend. That friend was really nice and always there for Lauren to defend and support her. I liked the romance between Lauren's best friend and Jim's boss. I really liked that Jim tried his best to be a good father to his three daughters, although he messed up so many times. He loved his wife so much!!! The movie showed those beautifully. I liked that Jim's best friend at work tried to stand up for Jim's daughter Hillary when someone upset her by thinking she was a guy. I loved how patient and nice Jim was to Lauren's sons. He was a true father figure. I loved how sweet Lauren was to Jim's daughters. She gave proper attention to each of them. She understood all their personal feelings, accepted them, and helped them out with small yet sweet gestures. I loved that Lauren's older son did his best to defend his mom against Jim and Jim's kids' behavior. I liked that Jake liked Hillary and accepted her for who she was: an athlete with special dietary needs.  I like how crazy Jake's dad and his stepmom were for each other because it looked like no matter how long they stayed together, they would NEVER become tired of one other. I loved when Jim and his daughters showed up for Tyler's game to cheer for him and support him. I loved how Jim helped Tyler with that baseball game.    There were soo many things I HATED in the movie.   -One of Lauren's kid sprayed Fire Extinguisher at their hired babysitter. I suppose it was done to show the naughtiness of boys, but really, showing something like this might give children or anyone else ideas to do similar things.  -Jim was a jerk to Lauren most of the movie. Here are some times: 1) He was looking at the TV while addressing her instead of at her at the Hooters' date. I found that very disrespectful. I know he did not find her interesting at that time, but despite that, he should have showed her some courtesy. 2) he embarrassed her in front of the cashier at the store,   3) he said crude things to her outside of the store,  4) he was mean to her in front of her coworker and friend 5) he was mean to her just because she helped his daughter Hillary (Bella Thorne) get a makeover, 6) he scared Lauren to death when he took her son out to ride the weird ostrich but did not apologize until way later, 7) he flicked his nails on Lauren's neck after they kissed at the end of the movie even though he knew it hurt her [I know she giggled while saying it hurts, but since it actually hurt, he should not have done that]   -They overdid it in portraying Lauren's difficulty to carry Tyler, her younger son, to bed. He is a little boy. Although he is growing up, he is not so heavy that she would have to carry him in that manner and repeatedly bang his head on every corner and doorway. THEY OVERDID THE BANGING THE HEAD part!! Seriously, a real mom would not have allowed their child's head to bang on the door frame soo many time. She would have shifted the child's head to try to prevent it, or maybe try to go through the door differently so that the child's head would not bang. I sincerely hope that it was a plastic figure in her hand Drew Barrymore was carrying during all the banging-head scenes.   -I hated how they showed Lauren's older son having a crush on his nanny. It was creepy.   -Lauren was portrayed as a sweet person who has no spunk throughout much of the movie. 1) She let Jim (Adam Sandler) talk to her and treat in that insulting manner without really defending herself.  Seriously, towards the end of the movie, her husband tried to get back with her and she stood firm and strong against it. I was like, WHERE THE HELL WAS YOUR STRONG ATTITUDE DURING THE REST OF THE MOVIE, LADY? Couldn't you have been like this  when Jim was a jerk to you? You let Jim walk all over you without saying much of anything to discourage such behavior! 2) She took too long to agree in putting Jim's youngest daughter to bed.  -I hated the husband of that Indian(or was Pakistani?) couple.  1) His wife looked at this group of male singers performing and smiled in a lecherous way. He tapped her rather sharply on the shoulder and gave her a dirty look to make her stop looking 2) His wife was looking at Lauren and smiling when Lauren came down the stairs specially dressed for the last day of the Africa visit. He also tapped her rather sharply then.   - Jake, Hillary's boyfriend, asked her out AFTER Hillary had the makeover. Although he showed interest in her before the makeover, he did not so much as talk to her. Is the movie showing that athletic tomboyish dressed girl do not get asked out? Even if that is true, movies can go any way a director wants it to be. They could have shown that even if no one noticed her as a girl in her athletic garb, he did They did show that. However, he did not ask her out BEFORE she had a girly makeover. Does a girl have to look pretty and gorgeous with her makeup and outfits before a guy publicly pays attention to her? That thought upset me.   -Jake looked at his stepmom's cleavage towards the end of the video chat. How gross!",0,0,ashaisha20,8MuWt2X59fo,0.19711235350838166,2015-10-19 09:10:23,False,False
