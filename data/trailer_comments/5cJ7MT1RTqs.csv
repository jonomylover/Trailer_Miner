Whether you know it or not it is true that you have a Father in heaven who loves you so much, that He gave His only son to take your place on the cross so that you might know Jesus Christ and believe in Him so that you may have everlasting life.(John 3:16) If you are still reading this, I want you to know that Jesus is the answer to that emptiness that you have been feeling and it is true that Jesus wants a personal relationship with you. So if you are ready to surrender and have a personal relationship with Jesus, or if you once were close with the Lord but have since drifted away from Him, read this simple prayer aloud and mean it with all your heart;   "" Heavenly Father, I recognize that I am a sinner, in need of a savior. I believe that Jesus died on the cross for my sins, was buried and God raised Him from the dead on the third day. I accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and my savior. Dear Jesus please forgive me for all my sins. I repent of my sins. I ask You Jesus to come into my heart and fill me with your Holy Spirit. Thank You Jesus for forgiving me, I promise to serve You for the rest of my days. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen"" If you have said that prayer out loud and meant it, I want you to know that your slate has been wiped clean and you have been made new in Jesus' name. ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."" (Romans 10:13) If you need prayer feel free to email me: laurenyo790@gmail.com P.S.

2018-11-03T02:21:20,"As someone with Cystic Fibrosis, I‚Äôm glad this is coming out to bring awareness. I admit, I was kind of upset when I heard this moving was coming out. Like all Hollywood chronic illness movies, I thought it wouldn‚Äôt show the truth behind the disease. You weren‚Äôt going to get it right and just romanticize being sick. After learning Claire Wineland helped on it, I started to warm up to the idea. When I saw the trailer, I‚Äôm actually happy with what I‚Äôve seen. Sure, it‚Äôs not going to be as raw and real as a documentary, but the root of the movie is a love story. There‚Äôs a few things I‚Äôve already seen in the trailer I‚Äôm confused about (VogMask styled masks are not CFF approved, they weren‚Äôt wearing masks when in the hospital hallways to prevent contracting other bacterias, the oxygen nasal cannula usage seemed randomly used and not consistent, patients don‚Äôt handle their own medications while inpatient, medications aren‚Äôt stored in a cart nor in the patient rooms, I don‚Äôt know if other complications were mentioned or are going to be mentioned like diabetes or bronchiectasis, I don‚Äôt know if you are going to say what bacteria each person has or mention that it‚Äôs not contagious to the normal population because our body holds onto it and normal bodies don‚Äôt [it‚Äôll bring awareness but also proximity fear, such as when AIDS was seen more and more]), but at least you‚Äôre actually trying. You had the nurse in a contact isolation gown, you used the right nebulizer cup (although I‚Äôve never gotten a Pari while in the hospital, but use at home), and you knew what a VogMask was... even though it wasn‚Äôt appropriate to use in that setting. The fact of the matter is, it will bring awareness to this disease and help make it as widely known as cancer or Downs Syndrome. I can count on one hand the number of people who knew what CF was before I met them and told them I have it. I HAVE met with other CF patients face to face, but we also enforce the 6 foot rule, culture results can‚Äôt show certain bacteria, no touching, no touching the same object unless hand sanitizer is used or it‚Äôs wiped down, etc. The movie comes out a few days after my birthday. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing it. Please, don‚Äôt do us dirty. I like what I‚Äôve seen so far, let‚Äôs keep it that way. üòâ (Also, if anyone wants to follow me and my Cystic Fibrosis story, I‚Äôm on IG @TheSaltyMutantsLife)",74,6,McKenna Hardy,5cJ7MT1RTqs,0.05750273118694172,2018-11-03 02:21:20,True,True

I love Cole, Jughead (even though he seems nothing like his comic self), and angsty broody little shits that morph into fluffballs once they've found people that love them and accepted have personally that love (which Riverdale!Jughead seems to be), but I honestly don't think I can handle sitting through the drama of Riverdale (no hate on Riverdale, I just can't handle dramas, much less melodramas, and we all know it's going to be chock full of crazy BS and misunderstandings, which I hate, plus a love triangle until Bughead happens, which I also hate) just to see those things. I doubt I'd stick aorund long enoufh to get into Jughead's character, or even see him happy as one half of Bughead and secure in his friendships. I'll probably settle for watching clips soon, since if I ever do watch the show, it'll be a while before I get around to it. Anyway, seeing Cole acting like this make me really excited, and I can't wait for it to come out. The movie seems pretty interesting and genuinely good, and Haley Lu seems really cool and awesome and I like her so far. I'm sure I'll cry during the movie, but the romance seem so good that I'll probably be willing to suffer for it anyway.

2018-11-04T07:24:29,"Dear Precious One, you may feel lonely and lost in this big world, but just know you are NEVER alone. Jesus Christ always have been and will always be with you on this earth. He is all around you, hovering over you even as you seek Him. He is nearer than you dare believe, closer than the air you breathe. If His children could only recognize His presence, they would never feel lonely again. Jesus knows every thought before you think it, every word before you speak it. His presence impinges on your innermost being. Can you see the absurdity of trying to hide anything from Him? You can easily deceive other people, and even yourself; but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whom loves you so much, can read you like an open book, large print.                                                                                                                        Deep within themselves, most people have some awareness of Jesus imminent presence. Many people run from Him and vehemently deny His existence, because the closeness of Jesus terrifies them. But His own children have nothing to fear, for Jesus Christ have cleansed them by His blood and clothed them in His righteousness. Be blessed by His intimate nearness. Since Jesus lives in you, let Him also live through you, shining LIGHT into darkness. Become one with Christ by welcoming Him into your life this very moment. Welcome the righteousness of Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit.           Acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Receive grace through faith in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross for us, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be sealed and justified in salvation. Believe in Him, have faith in Him and allow Him to lead and guide you in EVERY aspect of your life. Jesus Christ's love for you can't be measured or described using mere words. It is deep, eternal....and special just for you!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (Psalm 139 : 1-4;  Ephesians 2 : 13;  2 Corinthians 5 : 21)",25,1,msdogooder,5cJ7MT1RTqs,0.20464502164502163,2018-11-04 07:24:29,True,True

Then they started keeping us apart.  They realized we could not be around each other and it was too dangerous.  Instead we would be put in isolation, but if I was in the hospital at the same time as my friend we would be in rooms next to each other and talk on the phone.  We even would knock on the wall to each other.  I had a bi-lateral lung transplant at 12 and I am still not allowed around other CF patients, I have no immune system now.  My friend died waiting on her second transplant.  There are not enough lungs out there to keep us all alive.

An awful book, romanticizing illness and death for the sake of some teen bawling her eyes out and having quotes to write on Tumblr. No sick 16 year old thinks like that. Two teens with cancer falling in love, and not once questioning whether they are allowed? Not once meeting a doctor? John Green called them sick so he could throw some pretentious quotes in there and so people would cry over it, but made them live like they are healthy. I hate seeing this advertised like the new TFioS: the actors put so much into making it realistic, /they had fcking Claire Wineland on set to teach them how to cough/, the major aspect of the plot is finding a way to love each other DESPITE the disease (and I also hope while respecting the 5/6 feet rule).  None of that is similar to TFioS, so don't make that mistake. Don't advertise it like it's that.

2018-11-30T11:05:21,"As a CFer, I‚Äôm happy this movie will bring awareness to my disease, but I‚Äôm not sure how accurately it‚Äôll portray it. Most CFers aren‚Äôt on oxygen all the time. I haven‚Äôt worn an oxygen tube since I was 6 years old. I‚Äôm now 17. Also, a lot of us can spend years at home without being hospitalized. I haven‚Äôt been in a hospital bed since I was 12. I think the only thing this movie will get right are the pills we take a few struggles some of us go through, but you can‚Äôt romanticize a disease like mine and be totally accurate.   For instance, we cough out huge, colorful globs of thick mucus like a tobacco chewer spits. I have a cough bottle in my car, so I don‚Äôt send quarter-sized globs of mucus into the windshield behind me. I found out the hard way that it‚Äôs a good way to get flipped off. I doubt, anything like that will be shown here. Secondly, we cough a lot and tend to have the voice of a 50 year old smoker by the time we reach our 30s. I‚Äôm 17, and people have told me to lay off on the cigs before. Funny thing is, I never have and never will smoke anything, because I would instantly die. My voice is deep and rough because my throat has been wrecked by the coughing. Thirdly, don‚Äôt even get me started on what goes on in the bathroom. I know I struggle a lot since I don‚Äôt digest food very well at all. If you want to know what life is like for me at least once a week if I eat something that isn‚Äôt part of my strict meat and greens diet, simply look up ‚ÄúLA Beast‚Äù here on youtube, and watch what happens after eats 5 pounds of gunmy bears, drinks a few gallons of kombucha, or eats two cacti. It‚Äôs not fun, but I‚Äôm used to it to the point I really don‚Äôt complain anymore.   I do school at home, so I don‚Äôt have to deal with the bullying brought on by my disease like I dealt with for pretty much all of elementary and middle school. Only in high school people treated me right, but then CF gave me the finger, so now I can‚Äôt be around other students for 7 hours everyday, because of how prone to illness I am. Not only can‚Äôt I be around other CFers, but I can‚Äôt really be around my healthy peers either. My world is limited to one bedroom, one household, and a large neighborhood I can explore, because of how destructive CF is. I love to travel, but I don‚Äôt make lifelong friends on the beaches of Mexico or the streets of London. And those I do manage to know well enough to invite to my house, get super weird when they find out I have CF. Some of them are very sympathetic, which is nice, but I don‚Äôt need it since CF is all I‚Äôve ever known, and I haven‚Äôt done badly. Others refuse to acknowledge it and quickly drift out of my life. Very rarely does someone actually treat me like a normal person once the cat‚Äôs let out of the bag, so I‚Äôm used to loneliness, and I‚Äôm used to being treated normally only by family and my mom‚Äôs friends, who happen to be my friends since if I don‚Äôt want to stay home, I‚Äôll take my laptop with me to my mom‚Äôs work.   CF is so much more than what Google or even friends of CFers can tell you. This movie is cute and all, but it won‚Äôt be accurate. Someone has to die to make it hurt more, even though in the actual CF community, it‚Äôs a very strict social rule to never ever fall in love with another CFer when you have CF. I hope to live to the day where an accurate representation of CF is portrayed. If not, perhaps I‚Äôll make one myself. Life with CF is really this movie mixed in with Dumb and Dumber, mixed in with some docudrama about a famous athlete. Like a lot of CFers, I‚Äôm also very athletic. I participate in endurocross, which differs from motocross like rally racing differs from NASCAR, as well as hunting, which is how I harvest the meat I eat to survive, while also motivating me to stay fit so I can hike for miles on rough terrain with a rifle and some gear. If we can get a movie like that, it would be amazing, and would definitely be something I can get behind.  5 feet apart is great to get Cystic Fibrosis branded in people‚Äôs minds, but don‚Äôt expect most CFers to be like these characters, since most of us are just like anyone else.

2019-02-18T22:45:01,"I have CF. My concern with this movie is that it seems to be so heavily dramatizing the health of those of us with Cystic Fibrosis as if our entire lives are either spent 'throwing all caution to the wind' or living completely obsessed with CF every second of every day, as if the disease is what defines us as people.  Yes, I do 3 hours of treatments and take over 100 pills each day. Yes I spent my teenage years thinking I wouldn't live past 25. Yes I'll likely die decades earlier than my family and friends.   But all those things also made me a really interesting person with beautiful perspectives on life. I used all those hours doing treatments every day teaching myself skills so I now run my own business. I have an incredible and supportive wife and great friends. I am not my disease, and have a LOT to live for.     I'm really glad this film is bringing awareness to the disease (more awareness = more money for CF research = closer to a cure) but I'm afraid the heavy dramatization and romanticizing of two CF teens making really foolish decisions as if that's what it means to ""live life fully"" may just contribute to the idea that those of us with CF are nothing beyond our disease.

2019-02-24T03:23:56,"What is CF? Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease (so one is born with it) that messes up the cellular salt transfer process. One of the side effects of this is that it makes the mucus the body makes very thick. Thick mucus makes it very easy for the lungs to catch infectious diseases and loose function over time. Thick mucus also messes up the pancreas so it doesn't produce the enzymes needed to digest food. Nutrition is very important for lung health so not taking in enough calories can create a vicious cycle of weight loss and increase chance of infection and thus more lung function loss. When my son Ember (#k9copEmber) was diagnosed 10 years ago we were told he was likely to live to his 40's if he was fortunate and did all of his treatments. He takes artificial enzymes with every meal and is feed high calorie formula through a tube that goes right into his stomach. He had breathing treatments every day to keep his one lung as healthy is possible (he lost one of his lungs when he was 2 but has since been going strong). There IS hope for people CF. For some, depending on the CF mutation (there are different varieties of CF), there are medicines now that help address the salt transfer symptom. Ember is fortunate to be one of them and has improved (especially in weight gain) since he has been on Orkambi, the new medicine. Both my wife and I are thankful to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation whom helped fund the research to develop the new medicine. We are also thankful for Virginia Medicaid who picked up the tab after our insurance when Ember had his lung operations to remove his non-functional lung.",908,15,Zachary Murdock,5cJ7MT1RTqs,0.0654151645455993,2019-02-24 03:23:56,True,True
