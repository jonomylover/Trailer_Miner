2016-06-22T21:09:03,I've been watching tom cruise movies since the 80's I personally feel he ages like once every decade. I'd say the only thing has has gained from this decade was bags under his eyes but other than that the man looks good for a 53 year old. He is in great shape. Haircut looks good I mean damn he really takes care of himself as well as his acting skills. He is one of my personal favorite actors i'm glad he is doing another one. The last one was a good thriller. This one seems more action oriented which I don't mind one bit.

I enjoy Lee Child's books; I enjoyed the first Reacher movie, and, I'm looking forward to this sequel.  That said, it strikes me that if there is a flaw with the Reacher/Bond/Bourne movies, it's that the heroes have become, after so many iterations on screen, basically invincible. Reacher does get injured on (rare) occasion in the books, but, in this sequel, he looks pretty much unstoppable. Which invincibility is the guilty pleasure of this type of genre/material; I get it. It's undeniably fun to watch a hero kick butt and take names, like a force of nature. But, it does sort of remove any sense of real peril from the fisticuffs and gunplay. So, is there a way to pull off a balancing act of creating a hero who's tough, but, who is still not completely impervious to harm?",0,0,alancats,aRwrdbcAh2s,0.09240740740740742,2016-08-06 16:16:21,True,True

As a action movie it did okay for what it has got. Sadly the story isn't very compelling, or it wasn't told in a unique way. Cobie Smulders was actually the best part of the movie. She's strong, tough independent smart woman. The film has its plot holes, but it's entertaining. I'd rate it 6/10.

2019-12-15T05:48:19,"After busting a human trafficking ring led by Sheriff Wood, Jack Reacher returns to his old military headquarters to meet Major Susan Turner, whom he has been working with during his travels and has become his closest friend ‚Äì only to learn from Colonel Sam Morgan that Turner has been accused of espionage and detained.  Turner's attorney, Colonel Archibald Moorcroft, reveals that there is evidence that Turner is involved in the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan, but Reacher believes she is being framed. Moorcroft also reveals an old acquaintance of Reacher, Candice Dutton, has filed a paternity suit against him, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha Dutton. Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him, believing he is after her biological mother due to her past as a prostitute.  Moorcroft is later killed by an unknown assassin known as the Hunter. Reacher is framed for Moorcroft's murder and arrested and transported to the prison where Turner is being detained. Two hitmen arrive to kill her, but Reacher neutralizes them, rescues her and they escape to Morgan's house, having deduced he is involved in the conspiracy, to extract information. After they leave, the Hunter, revealed to be working with Morgan, kills Morgan and frames Reacher which he learns about from a friend, Sergeant Leach, when he asks her to investigate a military contractor.  Reacher and Turner uncover surveillance pictures of Samantha and surmise she is in danger, arriving at her home to find her foster parents dead and Samantha hiding in the kitchen. Reacher and Turner decide to escort Samantha to Turner's old private school for protection, but discover that she has her mobile phone with her and that the enemy probably knows exactly where they are. They discard the phone and make a quick exit, during which Samantha steals a backpack from one of the students to use the credit cards.  Reacher, Turner and Samantha travel to New Orleans in search of Daniel Prudhomme, the only eyewitness to the murders for which Turner has been framed. Upon landing, Reacher admits to Samantha he might be her father. Reacher and Turner then find Prudhomme in a derelict warehouse filled with drug addicts and learn that Prudhomme is connected to Parasource, a private military organization that is trying to cover up the murders. Reacher contacts Turner's friend, Captain Anthony Espin, to move Prudhomme into custody, but they are ambushed by assassins and Prudhomme is killed, while Reacher rescues a wounded Espin and finds out that the assassins are Parasource contractors. Parasource's CEO, General James Harkness, then sends the Hunter to capture Samantha after she uses a credit card from the backpack she stole to order room service.  Reacher and Turner, along with Espin, acting on information provided by Prudhomme, intercept a flight of weapons due to enter the country, where they confront Harkness and his men and accuse them of corruption. Upon opening the crates, however, Espin finds AT4 anti-tank weapons as declared in the flight manifest. Before Turner can be re-arrested, Reacher opens up one of the anti-tank weapons and discovers that they are filled with pure opium. They learn that Harkness framed Turner, who had been investigating his activities, for the murders of two soldiers who discovered that Harkness was selling weapons to insurgents and smuggling pure opium into the United States. Espin and his men then arrest Harkness, clearing Reacher's and Turner's names.  The Hunter and his men locate and chase Samantha through the streets to lure Reacher into a confrontation. Turner kills one of the assassins, whilst Reacher takes out another one on the rooftop. The Hunter captures Samantha and threatens to kill her, but she manages to escape and steal his gun. Reacher then tackles the Hunter onto another rooftop, briefly incapacitating both of them, and they have a vicious fight that culminates with Reacher breaking the Hunter's arm, leg and neck, before dropping him off the rooftop.  Following Harkness' arrest, Turner is reinstated in her old position and goes back to her office, where her colleagues and a recovering Captain Espin all welcome her back. Reacher promises to keep in touch before meeting Samantha at a diner to meet Candice, Samantha's mother, whom Reacher surmises he will recognize, as he remembers every woman he has slept with. Samantha reveals that the waitress that had been serving him is in fact Candice, and that Reacher cannot be her father, as neither had recognized each other. Reacher and Samantha then reluctantly part.  A short time later, while Reacher is walking along a road, he is surprised when a phone Samantha had slipped into his pocket rings. He finds a text message from her reading, ""Miss me yet?"". Reacher smiles as he sticks out his thumb to hitch a ride.",0,0,Chicken KFC,aRwrdbcAh2s,0.012459730192288335,2019-12-15 05:48:19,False,False
