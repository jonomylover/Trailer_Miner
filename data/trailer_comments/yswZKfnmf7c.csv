The inconvenience of the main character's illness is a laughable plot device that is used so often to stretch the movies runtime that it is pathetic. Amber Heard's character is inexplicably ridiculous (the character herself seems to be playing a role, based on how diferent she is when she first appears on screen, but the inconsistency is never explained), on top of that she delivers some of the worst dialogue of the year. To call her performance cartoonish would be too kind. The dynamic with the ex-wife and the estranged daughter is straight from Movie-Writing-Class101, but they even manage to screw up that seemingly fool-proof mold. As a viewer you experience no measure of attachment to any of the characters making the game ""will they/won't they"" between the lead and his ex-wife and the question of whether or not he will live in the end irrelevant. The lazy resolutions to every single conflict seal the deal.  The only justification for a bad movie like this would be awesome action scenes, but even on that front the movie fails miserably, so it doesn't even work as a guilty pleasure.
