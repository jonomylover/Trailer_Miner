Why?... because of what this has cost dc/superman fans. You see, paramount put Henry Cavill under contract to have a moustache in their film, and wouldn't allow him to shave it while shooting justice league (in a way this is also Cavills own fault for double booking film appearnces), resulting us with a creepy cgi upper lip in justice league. And why?... because paramount wanted a stereotypical 'Brit' with a moustache. Well I've got news for you paramount... you don't need a moustache to be British, fuck-tards!! (Deadpool already proved that to us!) They should have had him shaving his moustache for justice league and wore a fake one for mission impossible; it would look way better, and everybody wins. But no, paramount need to go take a massive shit on all the fans! Please everybody do not go and see this film... if it doesn't turn them a profit (and they know the reason why), then maybe they'll think before shitying on the fans? And what's so great about mission impossible... they say the mission is 'impossible,' yet tom cruise still keeps accomplishing them; they should call the films 'mission improbable; very unlikely, but still achievable.'

He's still cool and the movies work, but when a series like this has been around for more than 20 years, and Cruise is 55 years old, you wonder when it's time to move on?   I hope for another film, but I also want to have one of the films have Hunt make the ultimate sacrifice, then see if the films work with a new character, but with still awesome action.   Meaning, will we watch the series without Tom Cruise? This is a question about a lot of Franchises, there are plenty that have been able to continue for a long time, and recasting has to be brought up (same question for X-Men Franchise and Hugh Jackman) and (the Marvel Universe films, with Robert Downey Jr. and other actors).

2018-02-07T23:56:51,"Honestly, M:I is hitting the nail on the head with their movies of late! Bond died a sad death with all the massive pretentiousness that followed Casino Royale (which was simply brilliant and exactly the right tone for Bond but sadly they decided to go back to crap with its sequels.) Quantum and the most recent one are particularly hideous. And the Bourne films had no idea what they wanted to be after the trilogy. A directionless mess. But the makers of M:I have not made those mistakes. They know what they are and what they're not, they've found the right tone and are sticking to it in good taste. They're not trying to mutilate M:I (like other filmmakers love mutilating Bond, Bourne, and Star Wars) for the sake of ""breaking conventions"" like some narcissistic post-modernist schmuck. And they're not trying to flex any ego with pretentions of grandeur by hiring A-list directors who have no idea about this genre, just to show off. That's why M:I is the best action franchise going today. The filmmakers actually understand M:I and know exactly what to do with it. They actually have a PASSION for the material in itself. They don't treat it as some toy for them to use to grandstand with. They treat it with RESPECT",11,2,frootjooce,wb49-oV0F78,0.13317805383022774,2018-02-07 23:56:51,True,True

Maybe their going to hold on to the main villain from the last movie to give up all of his tech, people and more since we never got to see the full force of the rogue nation in the past movie.

2018-07-28T08:25:28,"Watched Mission Impossible:Fallout Today...Awestruck....One of the most impressive action movies I have ever seen...Words wouldn't suffice to describe the visual spectacle..The full throttle approach by director Christopher McQuarrie  will sent shivers down your spine.The stunts leave you breathless, the acting is well done, and the cast dynamic is better than ever.I can‚Äôt  get this film out of my head and hope Cruise and the cast get the recognition they so truly deserve.Tom Cruise with his swashbuckler swagness is willing to die for your entertainment. This movie would have been just another action flick without Cruise. Sure we have a stellar cast, but did not Mr. Cruise steal every scene? He is perfect in the role of Ethan Hunt, a spy whose whole team is rubbed out in a convoluted cover up at the start. It is up to Ethan to uncover the plot behind the failed mission. The movie is a series of unveiled plot twists that becomes implausible after a while. But that's not the fun behind Mission Impossible. The fun is watching the great action scenes with their suspenseful turns. So much so, we are willing to suspend disbelief to enjoy the ride. And to let ourselves be swept away by Mr. Cruise's undefinable quality to take us there.And the stunts are performed by Tom Cruise himself. The daring set pieces are well choreographed and acted in a way that looks real and genuine that puts most of this year's other action blockbuster movies to shame. Halo Jump-.One of the first stunt scenes in the film, it is not just another jump. In the film, Henry Cavill's August Walker and Cruise's Ethan Hunt get hit by a lightning bolt as they take the jump. Due to which Walker loses consciousness as well as his O2 cylinder. What transpires on screen next is heart-stopping, to say the least. And let me remind you all, it's no CGI but Tom Cruise. The toilet fight sequence will leave you spellbound. How I wish this scene was longer in length than it already was. To see Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill getting reciprocated by one man is oddly satisfying and hilarious to see. The paris chase scene-.Who doesn't love Tom Cruise on a bike? Give the man a bike and he'll give the best bike chase scene you have ever seen. This one is too thrilling to be real but Cruise cruises past the busy roads of Paris like a cakewalk.Director   Christopher McQuarrie uses gliding camerawork and razor-sharp cutting to heighten the excitement of Hunt‚Äôs improvisation, which results in a car-and-truck chase down the very narrow streets of Paris, followed by some white-knuckle motorcycle work by Cruise; his ride through a roundabout, seemingly sliding within inches of dozens of other vehicles, is truly terrifying.Helicopter Chase-In the climax of the film, Tom Cruise goes behind Henry Cavill in what turns out to be an edge of the seat chase sequence and probably the best chopper sequence seen in any film till date. And what makes it even better is that Tom Cruise learnt how to fly a chopper to bring authenticity to the scene. I can watch this film again just for this epic climactic sequence.Foot Chase-It's Tom Cruise and he is running, enough said. But what makes this scene iconic is the fact that he broke his ankle while filming this scene.  This whole long sequence is one of the major highlights of the film and has been shot beautifully.Its a must watch.Don‚Äôt miss it.My rating is 10/10. And don't waste your time reading this article, go and watch the movie as soon as you can. It's totally worth it.",0,0,Reju Jacob,wb49-oV0F78,0.16155465949820788,2018-07-28 08:25:28,False,True

The fight scenes were amazing and this was probably the most intense and suspenseful Mission Impossible I've ever seen. But there is one problem I had with this movie. The false advertising. There were tons of shots used in the marketing that weren't even in the final cut. And yeah sure maybe some of them are going to be deleted scenes on the blu ray. But there were just so many. 22-24, 56, 1:53-1:54, 2:24-2:26. These weren't in the movie at all. Now I might've gotten 1 or 2 of them wrong as I saw a late screening and my memory could be proving wrong but when you show scenes like that it sets up for a more grand movie. One of the main reasons I wanted to see this movie from the beginning was I wanted to see how he was going to pull that helicopter up so he doesn't crash into the truck. That's a huge setup and as far as I remember it wasn't even in the movie.

I'm sure the U.S. gov willingly supplied that Globemaster and the same with BMW and the remote controlled car.  I was actually happy when they nuked Rome, but was disappointed when it was just a trick. The baddies have nuclear weapons plot - yawn.  This latest film was so bad, I could barely watch the first 10 minutes without wanting to gouge my eyes out due to the cringe plot and dialogue. Real anarchists are a force for good in the world, not how they are portrayed in this; it's basically a propaganda film. THE GOVERNMENT ARE THE BAD GUYS eg Trump and co.

MI films have retained their popularity (and re-watchability) be being more mainstream and not offending any particular people or nation. There was always a sense of suspicion and hate in those 80s and 90s films, many of which were paid for by the U.S. Department of (Propaganda) Defense.
