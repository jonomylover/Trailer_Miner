2018-12-02T07:07:18,THEORY TIME!!!  I think that there is a killer version of all of them and there leader is “killer tree”  In the first movie I believe tre created a fracture between universes where in the other universe Tre created a baby faced killer cult.  The killer cult will realize what has happened and try to destroy the “impure” versions of themselves.  I do believe tre won’t save everyone in the end OR sacrifice her “powers” and herself to save everyone else. This will created growth for the character and will leave this feature with a good ending  My reasoning is for the scene at exactly 2:00 with 2 versions of 1 character (one looks slightly evil) As well as the explosion scene at 1:56 I think in that scene tre will lure them into the room with the bomb and kill all the cultists versions while sadly sacrificing herself.

2018-12-05T05:07:22,If Someone Is Attacking Tree And The Rest Then It Has To Be Someone Obviously Close I Mean Lori Died In The first Movie. But now in this sequel everyone is gonna die for real but she has to die to save them all every day so it could be tree if its in different dimensions which would be crazy! or it could be ryan and he wants to kill tree because she took over and his living in his dorm! but when you see the double version your thinking omg the movie Triangle can be similar to this i mean we cant guess i mean we should have to see how this turns out im ready for it! but just like other movies like the new halloween having a sequel SPOILER which it will i feel like this one will hopefully not but we will see i mean its hard to guess but its fun to create your own imagination plot about the movie! xD Also at 1:56 you can see basically a time travel or something about time so maybe they go back in time just pointing it out there think about lori died maybe she will go back and save people and be a better person!,0,0,Luke Slaby,THq6KlWgiqw,0.016414141414141416,2018-12-05 05:07:22,True,True

I haven't seen the first movie in awhile, but that guy the one lori took his mask was gonna pin tree's murder on. Maybe he was going to kill tree, but lori interfered and thus created the time loop.

2019-02-12T08:20:58,"Guys I have a theory. The reason why Tree is reliving the same day is because of that machine (that blows up midway in the trailer) The director said that the first movie had clues about the sequel and in Carters room, there’s all these science technology books that could hint to it. Also in the first movie, remember that convenient power outage where Danielle would say “our tuition dollars at work” etc. what if that’s because a device like that has to take up a lot of power and energy. It would explain the black outs and then when they turn on the device, it causes the loop. Just like how Tree gets a little weaker after being killed several times, the machine gets weaker and eventually starts blowing up in the loop, where it kills more people than tree but resetting the day so this time it is not just Tree reliving the same day, but other characters. The last part is kind of meh but I feel confident about the machine being the cause of the loop and the black outs lol 😂 hopefully that made sense.

(Spoilers ahead)   The trailer makes it seem like her friends are also reliving the day and they’re all getting killed and she has to relive the same day to save all of them and stop the killer from getting them. But in reality, she gets sent to another dimension or version of her life and she’s the one reliving the day but in a different lifetime with different events happening, until she figures out how to get back to her own reality.  Some scenes like where she says “you’re telling me I have to keep dying to save all of you”(I think that’s how it goes) isn’t in the movie. Which is what leans the trailer that way. As well as the line, “the killer’s coming after all of us”( or something along those lines) isn’t in the movie, which again makes the trailer seem different.

2020-05-06T14:11:47,"I finished this movie just now. But I have some confusions about the death of lori and gregory. According to this movie, tree has 2 options. Those options is about choosing present and future dimentions. In present dimention (monday the 18th), everything has changes, that is, her mom alive, carter did not fall in love with her anymore, gregory did not know her, lori wasn't the killer, gregory was the killer, and etc. The future dimention (tuesday the 19th) was opposite to present dimention. What my point is that, at the end of the story, tree chooses the future dimention which I was very confused. What on earth did she save the life of lori if in the future dimention lori was already died. That was because tree pushed her out of the window and what on earth tree killed gregory if in the future dimention gregory is still alive. It doesn't makes sense for me.
