I don't think they would give them plastic suits like in the old movies :P and they grasp their battle moves from what I see until now.    My problems: What I don't like is Megan Fox having another role on a comic book/cartoon franchise. Seriously? Are there any beautiful red hair girls in Hollywood? Only Megan Fox (brunette actually)? And another ''what a nice ass'' joke?  I think producers and fans these days cannot understand that fan service, porn and softporn has specific sites and places :P Marketing shouldn't be all about sex. WE NEED SEX EVERYWHERE.....Not. Especially a Transformers or TMNT movie.   Secondly I don't get the point behind Shredder wearing a hydraulic suit? Wouldn't it be badass to have an actual Asian actor playing Shredder as a powerful martial artist and criminal warlord? This is what Shredder is in the comics and cartoons. The hydraulic armor is just an excuse so that the final battle goes like this: Shredder kicks everyone's ass until they find a way to deactivate his suit and/or throw him from somewhere or throw something heavy on him :P It is the classic Man vs Machine or Hero vs Stronger Opponent solution in most Hollywood films and it is completely generic that we will see this here too.  Finally I hate dubstep. It is an overestimated and mediocre at best music style. I believe franchises need their own soundtracks orcherstral, epic, rock e.t.c to prevail and be remembered. Dubstep does nothing. Just sells more to young audiences and nothing else, sooo it is another commercial strategy.  We will see.

Everything made sense in BB - the way Wayne got access to his gadgets, the reason why the Bat costume had ears, the reason why his suit had Kevlar, the way Batman has a cowl in the neck of his costume, but does away with it in the sequel, etc.  Over here, this just seems like the blueprint of the Transformers movie had sex with the blueprint of TMNT, and out came a pile of jumbled up trash. This seems like it is trying very hard to be a credible attempt at a reboot.  A real reboot, like Batman Begins, seems effortless.

I grew up with the cartoons, comics, games, movies, etc. I've liked just about everything that's ever been TMNT (even a shout out to The Next Mutation, which was kinda dumb). I, personally, think that anyone that's already condemning this should just look at it this way: If the Ninja Turtles were a real thing, would they look like scary badass mutated turtles? Or would they look like silly cartoonish turtles? Exactly. So just ease up on being so negative on how they made them look in this. I think they look freaking bad ass! They look very similar to those ultra realistic drawings I found online before that someone had made to look really creepy authentic. Seriously, give it a shot. Go into it like it's a totally new thing, not like it's an abomination of something from your childhood. If you want to get technical about it, anyone that is on here complaining about this movie ruining your kids' cartoon, isn't really a true TMNT fan, because it's obvious you never read the original comics. Although they do look cartoon-ish there as well, the original comics are far more badass and violent than the cartoons or previous movies have even come close to.I'm stoked for it!

2014-07-26T22:25:08,"Okay, you know what I don't understand about all this? Fans of the original cartoons: ""OMG they look hideous! I HATE this new design."" ""This is NOTHING like the old design! How creepy!"" ""They EXPECT us to pay to see THIS? Who would see those ugly monsters?"" Hideous. Creepy. Ugly. Monsters.  ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO YOURSELVES? Since the very beginning, the turtles have established that they are indeed hideous creations to the human race, no matter how cartoony and cute they may have looked in the 80s, 90s, 2003 and 2012 series. To the other cartoon civilians, they were disturbing monsters, and had to hide using their ninja stealth and trenchcoats. Also, wasn't one of their BIGGEST LESSONS that they supposedly taught us as kids was that LOOKS. DO. NOT. MATTER???  I admit that I am fairly new to the franchise, and being a teenage girl I was much more drawn to their cuteness in the 2012 series. But after doing lengthy research on the franchise over the past 3 decades, from the comics up till now, I realized I didn't fall in love with their looks... but as an aspiring animator with a childlike heart, I fell in love with their unique story AND equally unique personalities. Also, they have to make difficult choices and learn lessons  through their adventures that help them grow as characters. I was mixed about it at first, but I might actually have to see this movie, even though I'm very aware it's nothing like the 2012 cartoon I currently adore. It looks much darker and more adult, but you know what? I am an adult and not a pink-and-doll-loving little girl anymore. Therefore, I think I can appreciate a good dark, adult action-comedy, if that what this turns out to be. And from the newer trailers I've seen, the turtles' personalities are VERY lively and true to the consistency of the franchise. True, they're not attractive, but this is 2014 PEOPLE. They can't look like the cuter 80s, 90s, or even 2012 cartoons if they want to get their emotions shown through facial expressions across in a live-action flick. They're not going to use cartoony puppets like the first one, because it's not DIFFERENT. Fresh and new is ESSENTIAL to any good film. The turtles have changed through SO many different interpretations over the years, and that should already be a lesson you've learned if you're over 13. Change happens. Life Happens. SERIOUSLY. I'm not even 20 yet, and I was able to figure that out. So please, people, enough with the butthurt'in and get over it. Nostalgia is a powerful emotion, I know that better than anyone. But it's just that, nostalgia. Time goes on. New memories are created. And with an open mind, you might find that the nostalgia can be found even in something like this.",1,0,Alexandra Reinert,OdgNSJiWJTo,0.0985829274891775,2014-07-26 22:25:08,True,True

But I went in thinking out of 10, it was gonna be about a 2 maybe a 3. But I went out giving it like a 5 or a 6. I like that each of the turtles were distinctly different. Even thought the story line was ""meh"" it was the personality of all four turtles that kept the film going. And just because Megan Fox is in it, she wasn't the star, the turtles were. And I have to say, the new Shredder armour was terrifying and OP (over powered). But you'd think you need that going against four powerful turtles. (Spoiler), although I wish we kinda saw more of Shredder. There were glimpses of him but nothing really more than him spitting cliche dialogue and actions. It was a great chance for them to build Shredder into something bigger other than throwing him in the story. (Another Spoiler) I kinda wish we saw a traditional or original armour that Shredder used before William F. character decided randomly to ""take it to the next level'. I liked his new ""transformer armour"" (once again, going against four powerful ninja turtles, I'd want that kinda armour too. But overall it wasn't a bad film.

For those commenters who say it looks realistic, you are probably young. It looks realistic because it's all you know. When I was a very little kid Terminator 2 came out, and we thought the computer animations were so realistic, a few years later Jurassic Park came out, and those Terminator animations suddenly looked so bad and outdated. But Jurrasic Park used them sparingly, and when its sequel came out years later with lots more CGI scenes, those earlier Jurassic Park scenes now looked like crap, but the physical prop dinosaur scenes look better than ever. Same goes for Men in Black. And so on and so on until eventually you can't take rampant CGI seriously.  It just never looks right. No matter how much detail they add, how many different texture effects they use, how cutting edge and expensive they are, I just can't buy it. The lighting never exactly matches with their surroundings, the focus never matches either, and the actors never seem like they're actually talking to anybody.  Yes, these turtles definitely look edgier and slicker, but for a series that was never gritty and dangerous, I'd rather see bad suits than watch the world's most expensive cartoon...

If you are a passionate TMNT fan, this movie should satisfy you. It conjures up that TMNT nostalgia and has plenty of action. Initially, I detested such a movie because ""Michael Bay"", but this is one of his best movies so far. Some of the things I didn't like include the aesthetics of the turtles; it didn't really bother me but a few improvements would have been better. There is some drama but it is fairly low-key in terms of length. Also, if there was a deeper, more intricate plot, that would have helped a lot. It doesn't entirely follow the backstory of the original TMNT series but it still features some classic elements and killer action! I'm 21 and I thought this movie is very well done. By the way, expect explosions and decent amount of action and some nice humor. Overall, I'd give it 9/10. Better than Age of Extinction for sure and definitely Bay's best movie this year.

Also the Transformers cartoon was created to sell the toys, and to this day Transformers is all this, check out the page ""To sell toys"" in the Transformers Wiki to see how the plot of all Transformers is written to sell as many toys as possible, all of you are overprotecting two long toy commercials.

I saw live-action 1987 turtles, next mutation turtles, robot and/or samurai shredder from 2003 turtles, and originally b4 the obvious re-shoots and knowledge William Fichtner was ""Shredder"" (noticeably not Oroko Saki), basically a pupil not unlike karai taking the mantle. Personally, I think they should've stuck to there guts and unveiled ""the real shredder"" aka Oroko Saki in the sequel along with bebop and rocksteady, and the third bring in krang and/or utroms. Assuming it'd gotten to 4, a total epic warzone of all sides fighting until basically someone good dies (if you've read the comics, or watched the 2012 series, you know who I mean) as well and others maybe even stop being bad (mutant doesn't equal bad obviously). Also if they had the film finished how exactly was the original dialogue with eric sachs as shredder anyway? It doesn't translate to the suit in the final product, but that's CGI so we know it's a voiceover and edited. It was an interesting angle and considering Karai takes over the shredder mantle or the foot clan or literally outranks Shredder at times, it could've been pretty cool. Of course it always seem like we loose out on getting the sequel we want due to hatred or stuff not liked in a prior-I still want inpendence day 3, a third film in this turtles series, the real sequel to the tmnt film ""secret of the ooze"" as well as the renet+savanti romero version of tmnt3 ""turtles in time,"" etc. Oh and ""Terminator-Future Wars.""",0,0,OneAndOnlySound,OdgNSJiWJTo,-0.007941595441595437,2019-12-23 03:02:35,False,False
