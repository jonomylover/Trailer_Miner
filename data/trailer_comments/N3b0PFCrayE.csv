2015-10-15T10:14:18,"You know, its been a few years since I've seen the Argentine one, but I'm 90% certain that they changed a bunch of stuff around. The original was never a revenge story, it had deeper implications than that. Plus I'm pretty sure Ricardo Darin's character didn't work with the person who knew the murder victim. And it was some dudes wife/girlfriend who died, not a female characters daughter. It feels like they're cutting out the substance from underneath the movie.   Now I'm not opposed to a remake doing its own thing if it can do it better (The Departed for example). However, this just seems cheap. It's taking what was original, thought provoking and compelling in the Argentine version and turning it into a generic and by the numbers thriller with most of its substance taken away.   The Argentine movie was one of (if not) the best movies ever made in Argentina.

Julia Roberts? Forget about PRETTY WOMAN, that was a 1/4 century ago. She a hard-bitten old crone in this one and oddly the audience cares little for her predicament. Must be something wrong with the film if viewers care more about the young male perpetrator than the old bag woman cop.

To be honest, I AM ANTI CRIMINALITY IN ANY FORM, but that's not an issue when you are sure that you can get away with the 'hereafter'... only - we are going through a transformation as a collective and this time we have to ask ourselves if those patterns (still) serve us ... I was not aware of the extraordinary until I could not deny that what happened was completely out of place - that I learned to swim on the dry did not help me a tiny bit - but that should not stop you when you have a big story to offer to the world ... negative linking is a tool that is used to create confusion - they had their agenda and I was a Tarot's fool who had to figure out what this was all about ... politicians use either CC or AT to make people believe that they are a necessary evil, this time they used their BEST CARDS and hoped that I would be easy to intimidate, not that I changed my mind, it only became creepy when they used MY CHILDREN to put me under pressure ... the FBI 'follows' me for the last years, they probably have bought my complete internet and social media, which made me isolated from society ... I chose to lay my cards on the table and there is NO EXCUSE for the things they did, even angry, I AM NOT A CRIMINAL, NOR A TERRORIST in disguise ...

Kyrina Maya is 11-13, she is born on day 123 and her ex-boyriend had the surname Mesuere, which could have made her Ms. KM when they married (although it's not a custom to use your husband's name in Belgium) ... Kristin's husband is called Mallentjer - another KM or 11-13 and her godfather and -mother make the circle round  (Martien and Mia) ... Martien Kiebooms -> MK -> 13-11 -> which makes me think about MK Ultra ... his youngest daughter is named An Kiebooms or AK -> 111 - that she's born on March 21 (of that, I'm sure), 1972, combines 3/21 with the year of the Rat, but I doubt about her German spouse, who is supposed to be born on the same day as Kyrina, day 123 of 1972 - the year of the Rat ...

2020-06-13T15:56:46,This movie is so badly made.
