I own an identical Carhartt jacket to the one Norton wears, right down to the color. I think I bought it in 2012.

2020-04-25T18:19:34,i thought this  was a good movie. As Rotten Tomatoes notes it is a little too long. But it does reward the viewers. At least there is attempt to make a good film.The probably ought have to edited it by a good 20-30 minutes. They also could not build up the suspense as well as they could have. In the end it seemed a bit too easy. maybe slight changes in screenplay were required. keep certain plot points hidden from the viewer till the end. So maybe reduced runtime and more suspenseful annd mysterious build up could have made this a far better film. Edward Norton was great and the rest of  the cast was good though Willis could have done better in the opening scenes. The most interesting idea was to relate Baldwin and Dafeo. A B from me. At some point the actors and cast and crew of Motherless Brooklyn would look back at the film with satisfaction.
