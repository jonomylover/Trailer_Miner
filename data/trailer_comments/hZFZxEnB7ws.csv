2014-07-01T12:03:59,"Vlad Țepes: One of the few great rulers of Romania that brought fear into his enemies through some unique strategies of battle.  His most definite mark was that he impaled a huge amount of people with no remorse! Despite what most say, HE DID NOT DO THIS FOR PLEASURE! he was impaling only THIEVES, LIERS and invaders of Wallachia, mostly punishing those that opposed the ways of God. There was no jail time or captures. He executed them on sight, impaling them to set an example.  Because he was so straight with his executions and filled his entire country with impaled bodies terrifying everyone, people started to think that he is evil. Until to the point the story of Dracula started to emerge.  Another reason why he was considered evil was that he impaled even a lot of rich people that tried to betray him. Because of this, those that opposed him tried to make the people hate and fear him by spreading FALSE stories in the hope that his support would diminish and he could be taken down from his throne.  Here are the 2 most infamous strategies that he used to defeat the ottoman empire even if he was greatly outnumbered.  1. He and his men chopped off an entire forest and dressed it as soldiers... When the ottoman soldiers arrived, they retreated frightened of the numbers Vlad armies were posing.  2. 'The night attack'. He and a few men dressed as ottomans went into their enemy camp, starting a riot under the reason ""Get up and fight, Romanians have dressed as ottomans and are sabotaging our camp!"". This way the ottoman forces slaughtered themselves.  After battles, all of the fallen bodies were impaled to set an example.  Make no mistake, the Ottoman forces could have crushed Romanian forces like bugs. The armies used for their campaign were not to conquer, but to recover the tribute Romanians were supposed to give. This means the numbers of soldiers sent to oppose Vlad was fairly low compared with the entire Ottoman armada!  This is a short and very simplified version of the real Dracula history. The legend is nice, but too far from truth. I like that in this movie Vlad is presented as a DEFENDER, ready to sacrifice all that he has for the sake of his family and people. One way or another this is what he actually did, and i hope this movie will resurrect at least the intentions of Vlad.",174,0,Zalmoxis,hZFZxEnB7ws,0.03430930930930931,2014-07-01 12:03:59,True,True

No, he can't withstand it, even if it isn't a direct hit because the light of a hydrogen nuke explosion is made by the fission and fusion reaction--> pretty much the same as sunlight, but a LOT more intense.   Additionally, he is very weak against modern long range weaponry (missiles and artillery), especially if they are loaded with garlic shrapnel. ",3,0,Harbinger91,hZFZxEnB7ws,0.10367647058823529,2014-07-03 08:29:52,True,True

The only element the two Draculas share in common is their obsession with blood; one loves the gory scene of impalement, while the other is infatuated with biting and sucking his victims’ necks.

The hollywood people however have switched it round so the perspective is on Dracula and why he did what he did.   I would just like to point out I hope that the film shows although he picked this 'evil' power for the right reasons and all that i hope it goes further to him becoming the original devil as portrayed in 1897 or whatever year it was.

As for those who say Vlad the Impaler was Christian, that is not true. Like a person who calls himself a vegetarian yet eats beef is not truly a vegetarian, so a person who calls himself a Christian yet does not follow Jesus Christ is not truly a Christian. Jesus Christ commands his followers to love their enemies (Matthew 5:44; Luke 6:27-37). He didn't command them to hurt or kill their enemies. He actually rebuked Peter for using a sword against another person (John 18:10-11) and healed the person whose ear Peter cut (Luke 22:49-51). Jesus Christ allowed the Romans to nail him to the cross. He died once for all, the sinless sacrifice for the sinful. Jesus is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world. His followers who walked with him didn't kill anybody. After Jesus rose from the dead and showed them, then gave them the Holy Spirit, they told people the Good News (Gospel) of what Jesus Christ said and did! Someday, Jesus Christ will return. That will be a miracle, and that will prove that he has the authority to judge the world.

2014-09-30T21:33:47,"1) Sunt roman de 44 de ani, am trait aici mereu pana acum 2) Vlad al 3-lea Tepes ( englezeste poreclit Dracula ori romaneste scris Draculea ) fiul lui Vlad al 2-lea Dracul si nepot al lui Mircea cel Batran, este invaluit in ceatza istoriei noastre. Majoritatea adevarului despre Draculea a fost distrus de catre inamicii lui din razbunare evidenta. Familia Basarab ( stirpea lui Mircea cel Batran ) este trunchiul din care familia Draculestilor s-a desprins. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_the_Elder - grandfather of Dracula http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_II_Dracul - father of Dracula http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_III_the_Impaler - Draculea himself 3) Tatal lui Draculea, a fost cavaler al ordinului Dragonului http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Dragon 4) De aceia, Vlad Tepes a fost poreclit “fiul dracului”, pentru ca Vlad Dracul purta permanent medalionul ordinului Dragonului la gat. 5) Realmente, pentru a garanta supunerea lui Vlad Dracul, sultanii otomani au pretins pe toti fii lui Vlad al 2-lea, ca “musafiri” ( ostatici princiari ) la curtea imperiala otomana. Desigur, cei doi printi au primit tot ce era mai util simultan cu tot ce era mai nociv din partea otomanilor: atat educatie cat si perversiune. Legenda spune ( si face noima dintr-un anume considerent ) ca otomanii ( cititi Sultanul sau vreunii mari demnitari imperiali ) au supus pe printi la perversiuni sexuale pentru a le amplifica supunerea temeinic verificata. In folclorul roman, se crede ca Vlad Draculea a devenit dusman fanatic otomanilor din aceste cauze, in timp ce fratele sau, Radu cel Frumos, a subcombat constrangerii si s-a islamizat ( pentru a evita violul sau tocmai din cauza violului ). 6) Orice razboinic stie ca lupta incepe din insasi sufletul lui si se extinde prin minte, corp, mediu, natiune, cultura, tot drumul pana la sufletele tuturor dusmanilor sai. 7) Posibil, Vlad Draculea, obsedat de asasinarea tatalui sau de catre rivalii domestici, si rasobsedat de traumele impuse lui si fratelui sau, a folosit ocazia de a cunoaste inamicii sai pana la excelenta: academia militara imperiala si biblioteca imperiala erau deschise celor doi printi. A invatat tot ce a putut chiar sub nasurile otomanilor, le-a invatat strategiile, tacticile, limbile, puterile. Tot ce avea nevoie pentru a ii combate pana la disperare si chiar mai mult. 8) Curand, Vlad Draculea a fost investit, DE CATRE OTOMANI, conducator al Valahiei, in partea de sud a ceia ce este azi, tara mea, Romania. Otomanii au inteles prea tarziu uriasa gafa pe care au facut-o. Vlad a reorganizat urgent natiunea sa decazuta. A marginalizat abuzivii si nemernicii, a exterminat parazitii si mai ales a oripilat toti tradatorii si dezertorii. In ultimii 24 de ani am contemplat declinul treptat al natiunii mele, ascensiunea sistematica a tradatorilor, abuzivilor, demagogilor, mincinosilor si asemenea indivizi. Pot spune sincer ca Vlad Draculea nu a pierdut timp pentru a regenera tara lui intr-o natiune militanta. In prezent posibilii nostri prieteni ne compatimesc, rivalii nostri ne ridiculizeaza, dusmanii nostri de tot felul ne dispretuiesc si umilesc cu fiecare ocazie. Tanjim cumplit dupa un lider eficient ca Vlad, pana in punctul in care am imbratisa un monstru. 9) Pentru a se imputernicii, Dracula si-a sacrificat extensiv umanitatea: a exercitat masiv TEROAREA, ATROCITATEA, URA EXTREMA pentru a lupta cu dusmanii bastinasi sau straini. 10) Desigur, razboiul economic a fost cel mai greu: negustorii brasoveni, si nu numai, erau rivali religiosi, politici si etnici. Pretindeau tot mai mult, si cu cat primeau tot mai mult cu atat se saturau mai putin. Cautau subjugarea economica a Valahiei, apoi metoda cu metoda, pana la completa subjugare sufleteasca si religioasa. Pestele mare inghite pestele mic, mereu. 11) Infuriat de abuzul brasovenilor, Dracula i-a reprimat extrem de crud. I-a arestat pe toti: barbati, femei, copii, tineri si batrani, sanatosi si bolnavi. Traditia spune ca i-a internat intr-un lagar de exterminare prin munca, la fel ca nazistii, si i-a supus exterminarii laborioase, pentru a construii fortareata de la Poienari. Toti foarte putinii supravietuitori la sfarsitul constructiei au fost aruncati de pe stanci, pentru a coplesii toti dusmanii trecuti, prezenti si viitori ai lui Vlad si ai Valahiei. 12) Razboiul real este precedat de razboiul psihologic, iar Dracula a invatat asta pe pielea lui, apoi a practicat asta asupra dusmanilor fara crutare. 13) Pentru a il distruge, toti inamicii sai s-au raliat intr-un pact nescris prezentandu-l drept un MONSTRU mult mai mare decat cel in care a fost Dracula nevoit sa sa transforme. El chiar a devenit un monstru in constiinta lui, dar inamicii sai au confiscat asta de la el si l-au agravat intr-un monstru inca mai rau. Inamicii sai aveau nevoie sa pozeze in vanatori de demoni si atunci au avut nevoie sa-l satanizeze complet. 14) Concluzie: Draculea a FOST NEVOIT sa sacrifice hoarde de ticalosi pentru a proteja putinii nevinovati pe care i-a mai gasit in natiunea lui. Ingrozitoarea lui “cruciada” a fost scurtata de intriga, tradare, siretenie. A luptat contra unor sanse cumplit de defavorabile si a oferit neamului foloase extreme daca evaluezi instrumentele pe care le-a avut la dispozitie. Valahia lui Dracula si Romania mea necesita conducatori eficienti, mantuitori implacabili, chirurgi biologici-mentali-sufletesti daca mai e sa ajunga macar pana la respect, daca nu pana la glorie. Simtim permanent ca suntem pe lista de sacrificiu, ca proprii lideri ne vand in paguba la orice ocazie, ca riscam soarta pieilor rosii din America de nord: impingerea in rezervatii catre o agonie lenta, finalizata in exterminare si disparitie istorica. 15) Soarta noastra pare foarte sumbra: tinerii nostrii dispera si degenereaza, batranii nostri se resemenaza si decad. Solicitam indivizi de eficienta lui Vlad Tepes, pentru a ne recupera si pentru a ajunge la capatul timpului. Voi nu ati simtii la fel ? 16) Dumnezeu sa-i impace sufletul in nemarginita Lui mila. Ne-a lasat un exemplu si macar speranta ca va mai apare un alt lider ca el care sa ne ridice la valoarea noastra completa.",0,0,Radu Tirea,hZFZxEnB7ws,0.09500000000000001,2014-09-30 21:33:47,True,True

2014-09-30T22:03:46,"First the English version of a romanian's comment ====== 1) I am a 44 old romanian, lived here all my life 2) Vlad III the Impaler ( english nicknamed Dracula or romanian written Draculea ) son of Vlad II Dracul, and grandson of Mircea the Elder ( Mircea cel Batran ) is a individual shrouded into the mist of our history. Very much of the truth about Draculea was removed by his enemies, revenge being obvious. The family of Basarab ( Mircea’s lineage ) was the main branch out of wich the family of Draculesti split. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_the_Elder - grandfather of Draculea http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_II_Dracul - father of Draculea http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_III_the_Impaler - Draculea himself 3) Yes, Dracula’s father was a knight of the order of the Dragon http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Dragon 4) As such, Vlad was nicknamed “fiul Dracului” ( the son of the Devil / Dracul ), “fiul lui Draculea” because Vlad Dracul always wore the order’s medallion on his neck. 5) Indeed, to secure Vlad’s II Dracul loyalty, the sultans of the Otoman Empire asked for all his sons, as “guests” ( read royal hostages ) to the Otoman imperial court. Of course, the two brothers got the best AND the worse of the court: both education and perversion. The legend says ( and it makes some sense from the psychological term ) that the otomans ( read - the Sultan or some very high officials ), subjected both young men to perverse sexual rites, to assess theyr submision. In our romanian folklore, the say is that while Vlad Dracula became fanatical enemy of the otomans for this reason, Radu the Handsome ( Radu cel Frumos ) submitted under the pressure and converted to Islam ( either to avoid the rape or because of it ). 6) Any fighter knows that fight starts into his very soul, and extends trough his mind, body, enviroment, nation, culture, all the way to every of his enemies. 7) Plausible, Vlad Draculea, haunted by his father’s death at the hands of his domestic rivals, and overhaunted by the psychological traumas he and his brother were subjected to, took the oportunity to study his enemies to the point of excelence: the otoman military academy was open to the two princes, the imperial library as well. He learned all he could, right under the nose of the otomans. He knew theyr strategy, tactics, languages, power. All he ever needed to fight them into despair, and some extra. 8) Soon Vlad Dracula was crowned, BY THE OTOMANS, leader of Wallachia ( Valahia ), into the southern part of what is today my country, Romania. The otomans realised too late theyr huuuge blunder. Vlad wasted NO TIME to organise his falled nation. He marginalised the abusers and the unworthy, exterminate the parasites and most of all horrified all defectors and traitors. For the last 24 years I contemplated the gradual decline of my nation, the relentless rise of traitors, abusers, demagogues, liars and such. I can honestly say that Vlad Dracula wasted no time to redeem his country to fighting condition. Curently, our would be friends pitty us, our rivals look down to us, our enemies of any nature despise us and humiliate us each time. We dearly long for a leader eficient like him, to the point that we would embrace a monster. 9) To empower himself Dracula sacrificed his humanity extensively: he used brute TERROR, ATROCITY, EXTREME HATRED to wage his fight abroad or at home. 10) Of course the economical war was the hardest: the merchants of Brasov and many others, were of foreign faith and politics and ethnicity. They asked more and more: the more they received the MUCH more they asked, until they started to plunder directly. They sought to subjugate Wallachia economicaly, then means after means, until full psychological and religious subjugation. The big fish eats the small fish, always. 11) Enraged by their abuse Vlad Dracula punished them extremely cruel. He arrested them all, men, women, children, young and old, healthy and ill alike. Traditions says that he used them into a labour camp, much like the nazis, and subjected them to extermination regimen, to build the castle of Poienari. All the very few survivors at the end of the construction were thrown from the edge of the mountain to certain death bellow, to further seed terror into the souls of all his enemies. 12) The real war is always preceeded by psychological war, and Dracula learned that on his skin, and practiced it on his enemies without sparing. 13) To destroy him, all his enemies banded themselves into an unwritten pact: depict him as a worse MONSTER than he needed to become. He became a monster into his own conscience, but they took that from his soul and forged him into a far worse monster. His enemies needed to pose as devil hunters, so they needed to satanise him fully. 14) Conclusion: Dracula HAD TO sacrifice huuuge lots of villains to save the few inocents he found into his nations. His horrible “crusade” was cut short by intrigue, betrayal, cunning. He fought against overwhelming odds and delivered extreme use to my nation considering the means at his disposal. Dracula’s Wallachia back then, and my Romania right now, need eficient rullers, unwavering saviours, biological, mental and psychological surgeons to rise again at least to respect, if not to glory. We feel every moment that we are on the list of the sacrificed, that our own leaders trade us on every turn, that we risk the fate of the red skins of north America: pushed into reservations to slowly agonize to extinction, and out of history. 15) Our fate seems very grim, out young grow desperate and corupt more and more, our elders grow resigned and decadent. We need people of Dracula’s efficiency, to recover and live to see the end of time. Would you not fell the same if you were to be us ? 16) May his soul be put to rest by God in his infinite mercy. He left us the example of his eficiency and the hope that some day another leader like him will raise us to our merits",0,0,Radu Tirea,hZFZxEnB7ws,0.06295765592432256,2014-09-30 22:03:46,True,True

The reason of the inpeld muslims was that they had the guts to try to conquer us and change our religion and become like them. The name of the King was never Dracula hes name was Vlad Tepes.

A man who had no choice,but to become a devil, which saved the world from the devil, (which was supposed to be the Sultan/Islam at the time to medieval Christian Europe).  Take some time to read about the Prince Dracul, (Vlad the Impaler). You will see that he saved Europe from the mightiest Super-Power in the world. Reading his story, is like joining the dots that makes a clear and powerful figure. What is very surprising is that though he gave, the Vatican the ability to spread Christianity around the globe. The Church not only gave him the grand title, or not of the devil/dragon, to spread fear in the Islamic world. They destroyed him utterly; after a successful lifetime battle with the Ottoman Caliphate. He stopped this unstoppable force, after the fall of the greatest city in the Christian world, Constantinople/Istanbul. The Church/Vatican, gave Prince Vlad money, and some soldiers. Anyway he not only beat the Ottoman Empire on his own. But 'they never continued to venture into Christian lands anymore'. In history Islam begin to weaken in all aspects, and ventured into it's Dark Ages. Only after Prince Vlad won, then Europe soon realized that they could expand, in 'all forms'. No one really sees this, because Vlad was made into a monster, which the Church did easily. All they had to do was to tell people his was a real monster, but he was not a real monster. Look at any middle-age ruler in Europe. Then look all together what they did in their lifetime. No difference at all. ",0,2,John Hamill,hZFZxEnB7ws,0.23151515151515153,2014-10-03 22:45:45,False,True

2014-10-05T12:49:33,"Historic Dracula (Vlad) in medieval Wallachia was a merciless and a brave man! His deeds had been an effort which was to have painful repercussions even today. For example:  ""his impaling exploits [were] seized upon by Ivan the Terrible in Russia. Vlad had shown himself to be a hero of the Orthodox faith and a model of the harsh, autocratic ruler. As such he was taken to justify Ivan’s supposed divine right to tyranny and sadism."" (Leatherdale, Dracula: The Novel and the Legend, 216)  The story that he dipped his bread into the blood of those impaled before him had been a clerical propaganda which shows the extent to which Vlad terrorized the imagination of the Medieval Europe. However at the end, Vlad’s position eventually weakened as the Ottomans gripped the control of Wallachia. Radu the beautiful, as we all know, defeated Vlad in a landslide with a support from Ottomans. In Romania, after 19th century, as a ""Conditio sine qua non"", he served to nationalist purposes. In the imagination of Turkish historiography (in the past), however, he remained a magnet for the evil.

2014-10-11T10:40:48,"Due to the mixed critical reviews, I was afraid this trailer was another Clash of the Titans situation. In which a handful of epic scenes are strung together in a well made trailer to make the movie look far better and entirely different then it really is.  Fortunately this was not the case at all. The movie takes a new look at the legend of Dracula and truly earns its name sake of being Untold. Dracula is portrayed in an entirely different fashion with a loveable story which brings a new shine to an old and somewhat dull legacy that has been sorely overused. The story takes into account both the historical aspects of Vlad and the fictitious facts of Dracula to combine them into a very real feeling story, which pays homage to both fields.  The movie suffers some several hiccups in the plot and scene set up, which show that this is indeed the director's film debut. Combat at times can get a bit blurry, but its hard to keep the camera on track of a guy who has acquired the powers of Satan. It brings several new and creative elements into the scenes and plots, which allow for several surprises with the clever use of things that just have not been done before. It takes quite a bit of tact to make a full length movie surrounding a guy who can instant kill his enemies all at once.  Although it holds several flaws, Dracula Untold has a great deal of charm and intricacy that makes it a great thing to waste an hour and a half on watching.

He was the son of Vlad II, who gave up the power of the Ottoman Empire at the time of Murad II, Mehmed II's father. Mehmed II and Dracula is indeed hostile, but Mehmed never die at the hands of Dracula, the opposite happened, Dracula is defeated in the feud with Mehmed II.   Illustration of Vlad III Dracul Dracula versus actual existing in Hollywood  ""Dracul-ae"" the Romanian language designation for the noble Order of the Dragon (Romanian; Draco = Dragon), and the suffix ""-ae"" means ""son of"". As for the ""Order of the Dragon"" itself is one of the group of knights were prepared by the King Sigismund Holy Roman Empire as a special warrior in the crusade  The name itself refers to Vlad Dracula III ""Tepes"", son of Vlad II voivode (governor) of Wallachia, Romania. At the time of his father Vlad II, Wallachia ruled by the Ottoman Empire, and as a guarantee of loyalty, Vlad III (Dracula) and then sent to schooled in the Ottoman Empire  Dracula / Vlad III and educated in Yeniseri unity, a special forces military Turkish Empire with his brother Radu Cel Frumos. That is where they learn best in military units of its time. Age Dracula was still young, 13 years alone, the difference is only one year older than Mehmed II, the son of Murad II, Sultan of Turkey at the time.  However, although still young, has been sworn in Dracula Dragon Order that was formed to fight against the Muslims, and so that's what his intention. Therefore he hates Mehmed and Islam, although his brother Radu Cel Frumos be Muslim and commander Yeniseri Mehmed trust, in turn, took office when the Sultan of Turkey.  When his father Vlad III Dracul, Vlad II was killed and the coup in 1447 by John Hunyad of Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and helped liberate from the clutches of John Hunyad Wallachia. After that Sultan Murad II, Mehmed II's father, then asked the father of Vlad III to replace lead in Wallachia.  Despite allegations Sultan Murad II, this is the long-awaited opportunity Vlad III Dracul, who from the outset had hated her father because she wants to submit to the Muslims. Armed with Arabic, Turkish and military knowledge in Yeniseri, Dracula disguised as part of the Muslims in every Muslim fortresses and forts finish Islam in Romania from within.  Post-1453 Sultan Mehmed II, who holds the Al-Fatih conquered Constantinople since, sent some emissaries to make sure everything is fine in the year 1459. Wallachia Vlad III Dracul Mercilessly kill the messengers of the Sultanate of Turkey who came to collect the jizya (taxes for the disbelievers) are supposed to be paid every year. Looking for trouble, Vlad III killed these messengers by nailing their turbans to his head. On the pretext that the messenger acted brash, no honor by not want to take off his turban, and just wanted to open his turban before God.  On hearing this Sultan Mehmed II of Wallachia and respond to problems in particular. In 1461 Sultan Mehmed II ordered his commander Hamza Bey brought 1,000 troops to capture Dracula and restore stability in the region of Wallachia, and the fate of the 1,000 troops it ended tragically.  Dracula using infiltration capability with what he learned in Yeniseri, he really understands the tactics and strategies to fight the Muslims, then the effective movements, Dracula then beat and slaughtered 1,000 Muslim troops. Dracula impaled (stab with wood from the anus to penetrate into the esophagus) is 1,000 troops, to be a human corpse forest. Hamza Bey, the commander of this army, stationed in the jungle corpse and placed in the highest wood as a symbol.  Vlad III Dracul since it got the title of ""Tepes"" or ""The Impaler"" - ""The Impaler"", cruelty known and recognized worldwide  Found this, Sultan Mehmed II and commissioned Radu Cel Frumos, the younger brother of Vlad III Dracula to lead 90,000 troops to stop Dracula. Need to stop wolf wolf, Mehmed understand that the right person because Radu Romania plateau could only be understood by the original   Cel Frumos Radu (Radu the Handsome), the younger brother of Vlad III Dracul  In contrast to his brother Vlad III Dracula, his brother Radu Cel Frumos (The Handsome), embraced Islam and became a Muslim and leader of special forces Yeniseri. Radu led 90,000 through the woods and hilly ground to attack his brother Romanian Dracula who survived in the fort 'Poenari' property   Catatea Poenari, Vlad III Dracula Fortress  This battle was not easy, considering Cetatea Poenari (Poenari Fortress), the land is very steep and difficult to penetrate. Finally Radu attack at its peak in 1462 occurred the night Poenari Fortress known ""Atacul de noapte"" - ""The Night Attack""  Radu Cel Frumos be replaced Dracula of Wallachia leader after defeat. Dracula is fighting a losing battle to save yourself and run to ask for protection on Hunyad John King of Hungary.

Until now recognize as a hero Romanian state in the crusade, and statues scattered in Romania. For Muslims, Dracula is a symbol of the cruelty of the enemies of humanity, human awl, and sucking blood.

For the haters though, and those that like to comment about Romania, Vlad the hero, and how the Turks took his head..... Vlad Tepes the third, was not a vampire, he was a cruel ruler, forged by necessity. He was raised by the Turks, and for a reason I can't ""fathom"" he disliked them a lot. To the point that he wanted to ""Impale"" them all. Driving a fat pointy stick through the bottom and ehm well, you get the point. Such perversions are not that common, can you only imagine through what he went through to develop such.... peculiarities?  His father was betrayed by those closer to him, his allies turned on him.... He was One against everyone. Can't say I don't feel bad for him being so lonely, and despite all that he experienced he turned to the only thing he could do, he used fear as his weapon, fear was his only true ally. A patriot and a military genius, he was able to take on far superior forces and defeat them. He did so much with so little, he didn't have a big empire or any Sultan backing him up, all he could expect was a dagger in the back. As a human being i am not condoning to his cruel actions, but I think i can understand him a bit. And i can't help but wonder, if he had a proper army and aid from the West....He could have defeated the Ottomans, perhaps even throwing them back out of the Balkans. Well, what the heck?

2014-10-15T21:00:41,"It is the right time to start better understand to big picture of the Vlad III era. First: Original Roman empire was ruptured to two pieces from which the West and East changed its political elites (Franks and Turks), but with the same financial background and interest groups. Second: Both divorced parts of original one empire stayed mixture of original ethnics even after division to West and East Empire. Third: Vlad III. was Prince of Valachia not Prince of Transylvania. Such geo-political entities are usually called as buffer states without real independence and only created as an iron curtains, but.... ususally exactly those locations are full of middle class open minded and independent peoples. For this moment I will use term Val-As-es. In Karpatian/Balkan region called Vlachs, but such open minded and free people live around whole Europe and also around whole Levant and Asia Minor and also around Scandinavien/Baltic and also around both Black and Kaspian Sea. Those people live also in Iran and perhaps India. Those people are nowadays christians, but also moslims or even caldean, aramejans, armenians, felahs or palestinians. The origin of those people is so ancient, that even a is-ra-el-ites are not aware about their common denominator to the Val-As-es. First of all those Val-Ach-ians are original worshipers of the BAL-am whose name had to be forgoten and tarnished. But its traces persisted in many grammars as articles El-, Al-, Il-, -ul with meaning ""The one famous"", ""Great"", etc... Original meaning is Velký Syn - Great Son or Great Man. BAL-am laer called as BELZEBUB or DIA-BAL-AS or El Diablo. The main competitor from Bronze or even Cooper Ages to the only one god. God without name in christiana or judean tradition and god with miscelaneous names in moslims tradition. El Dios plus El Bal-os makes together Al Dia-Blo-s. The name of Bal-as is most closely kept in moslims tradition as (b)Al-ah/s. In reality with should stop this virtual fightings and we should start to cooperate very closely. Otherwise, we will became only another lost generation, another toys in hands of real vampires hiden behind the golden curtains and profiting from our blind and fratricidal fighting.

I have to admit, Hollywood are really clever in manipulating the general publics point of view.  Dracula was an insane man,  who impaled over 30,000 men, women and children with stakes and left them dangling off trees..Disgusting. the idea of fighting for his family is bullshit as his own brother Vadu was on a conquest to stop his madness. And his own father and brother Marius(i think his name was) were killed by Draculesta(family name)'s rivals which dracula joined alliance with just after.  And guys..its not about religion here, its to do with good and bad. And Dracula was beyond bad!

2014-10-16T05:29:45,"It is the right time to start better understand to big picture of the Vlad III era. First: Original Roman empire was ruptured to two pieces from which the West and East changed its political elites (Franks and Turks), but with the same financial background and interest groups. Second: Both divorced parts of original one empire stayed mixture of original ethnics even after division to West and East Empire. Third: Vlad III. was Prince of Valachia not Prince of Transylvania. Such geo-political entities are usually called as buffer states without real independence and only created as an iron curtains, but.... ususally exactly those locations are full of middle class open minded and independent peoples. For this moment I will use term Val-As-es. In Karpatian/Balkan region called Vlachs, but such open minded and free people live around whole Europe and also around whole Levant and Asia Minor and also around Scandinavien/Baltic and also around both Black and Kaspian Sea. Those people live also in Iran and perhaps India. Those people are nowadays christians, but also moslims or even caldean, aramejans, armenians, felahs or palestinians. The origin of those people is so ancient, that even a is-ra-el-ites are not aware about their common denominator to the Val-As-es. First of all those Val-Ach-ians are original worshipers of the BAL-am whose name had to be forgoten and tarnished. But its traces persisted in many grammars as articles El-, Al-, Il-, -ul with meaning ""The one famous"", ""Great"", etc... Original meaning is Velký Syn - Great Son or Great Man. BAL-am laer called as BELZEBUB or DIA-BAL-AS or El Diablo. The main competitor from Bronze or even Cooper Ages to the only one god. God without name in christiana or judean tradition and god with miscelaneous names in moslims tradition. El Dios plus El Bal-os makes together Al Dia-Blo-s. The name of Bal-as is most closely kept in moslims tradition as (b)Al-ah/s. In reality with should stop this virtual fightings and we should start to cooperate very closely. Otherwise, we will became only another lost generation, another toys in hands of real vampires hiden behind the golden curtains and profiting from our blind and fratricidal fighting. Those from VAL-AS, VEL-ES, VIL-IS, VUL-US, VOL-OS sure understood. Our lives are only small episodes in Ariadna's thread.

2014-10-22T21:52:41,"The Real Untold Story of How the Muslims killed the Dracula   “He who controls the present controls the past.” [1] Many will be aware of the new Hollywood film which has been recently released entitled: ‘Dracula Untold’. It might not be well known that, supernatural powers aside, the tale of Dracula is actually based on a real person. Unfortunately however, this film is such a fictitious remake that it speaks volumes about the rise of Islamophobia as well as it does about the West’s attempts to seek to rewrite history by glamorising mass murders whilst peddling the fear of the ‘Muslim invaders’. What follows is a summarised account of the real, well-known history of Dracula. Vlad Dracula was a three-time Voivode of Wallachia (modern day Romania), ruling mainly from 1456 to 1462, the period of the emergent Uthmani Khilafah, the Ottoman Caliphate, and its conquest of the Balkans. His father, Vlad II Dracul, was a member of the Order of the Dragon, which was founded to protect Christianity in Eastern Europe and was fashioned after the military orders of the Crusades requiring initiates to defend the Cross and fight the so-called “enemies of Christianity”, in particular the Muslim Ottoman Caliphate. Childhood There was a time, when much of what is modern Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Belarus, the Balkans, the Crimea and almost all of southern Russia was ruled by Muslims. This was once part of the Muslim heartland of Islām, the Ottomon Empire and produced many great leaders and scholars. Today of course, the only majority Muslim community found in mainland Europe is in Bosnia, Kosovo and al-Baniya, Albania. The Christian communities in Hungary and Wallachia wanted to fight against the Ottomans, however they were very weak and there was much disunity amongst them. In 1436, Vlad II Dracul ascended to the throne in Wallacia only to be dethroned by those loyal to the King in Hungary, János Hunyadi. Vlad II sought the help of the Ottoman Muslims who in turn sought payment of the Jiz’yah, a tax which non-Muslims pay to a Muslim ruler in return for their protection from outside nations. As part of this deal, Sultan Murad II asked that Vlad II send two of his four sons to Istanbul to be educated. Vlad II agreed and so he sent his two sons and he in turn was ascended to the throne again in Wallachia by the Ottomans. The two sons who travelled back with the Muslims to Edirne were Vlad Dracula and his younger brother, Radu. Vlad is the one who we have now come to know as Dracula because the word Dracula means ‘son of Dracul’ which was the name of his father. The word ‘Dracula’ has of course since taken on a different meaning, being synonymous with a devilish evil, and we will see why this is. Whilst under the tutelage of the Ottoman Muslims, the boys were provided with education including that of Islamic texts. Radu became Muslim and was a close friend with the young boy of the Sultan Murad II, Muḥammad (Mehmet II). Vlad however was rebellious and is recorded to have developed a well-known hatred for Muslims even though he too studied the Qur’ān, spoke Arabic, Persian, Turkish and of course Wallachian (Romanian). In 1447 the King of Hungary attacked Wallachia and killed Vlad Dracula and Radu’s father and brothers. Given that Vlad’s father had paid the Jiz’yah, the Muslims defended them against the Hungarians and they installed Vlad Dracula in power. In the meantime, Radu at the age of 22 became a leading Mujāhid (one who strives in the path of Allāh) within the Ottoman court and commanded the Janissaries (the foreign contingent of the army). He was sent by his good friend Muḥammad, who by this stage had become the Sultan at the age of 19, to subdue various rebellions such as that in Anatolia. Perhaps more importantly, he participated alongside Sultan Muḥammad in the Ottomon siege which eventually led to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Constantinople was the capital city for the Roman Byzantine Empire. Napoleon was quoted as once saying, “If the Earth were a single state, Constantinople would be its capital” [2]. As for Sultan Muḥammad, he was from here on forever to be known as Muḥammad Fātiḥ (Muḥammad the Conqueror), and his new city was from here on forever to be referred to as Islambul, meaning the “City of Islām”. It should be noted that it was only during the secularisation process of Ataturk where it took on the name of ‘Istanbul’ which has no relevant meaning. Incidentally, there are coins in the British Museum from 1730 where the name of the city, Islambul is clearly imprinted [3]. By conquering Constantinople, Sultan Muḥammad Fātiḥ had also fulfilled the blessed words of the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu ‘alayhi wasallam) who said concerning this event: “Verily, Constantinople shall be conquered. Its commander shall be the best commander ever, and his army shall be the best army ever.” [4] Crusades With the fall of Constantinople, Pope Pius II called for crusade in 1459 against the Ottoman Muslims, at the Congress of Mantua. In this crusade, the main role was to be played by Matthias Corvinus, son of János Hunyadi, the King of Hungary. To this effect, Matthias Corvinus received from the Pope 40,000 golden coins, an amount that was thought to be enough to gather an army of 12,000 men and purchase 10 warships. In this context, Vlad Dracula allied himself with Matthias Corvinus, whose family it should be remembered killed his family, with the hope of keeping the Ottomans out of the country. The Declaration of War Later that year, Sultan Muḥammad Fātiḥ sent emissaries to Vlad in Wallachia to urge him to pay a delayed jiz’yah which Vlad Dracula had put off paying. Unknown to the Ottomans, Vlad Dracula had already allied himself with the Hungarians and joined the Pope’s call for a Crusade against them. Vlad Dracula met with the emissaries and said to them, “If you want to step inside of my port, you have to take off your turban and bow.” The Muslims responded that they would not remove their turban and “we only bow to Allāh”. So Vlad once again demanded, “Take it off” and again they refused. Vlad Dracula then told someone to come with some very big nails and hammers and he said, “If they refuse to remove it for me then they will never remove it again.” And he commanded that their turbans be nailed into their heads. Of course, this resulted in them being killed – this act was a declaration of war against the Muslims which Vlad Dracula had been spoiling for. Sultan Muḥammad Fātiḥ sent the Bey of Nicopolis, Hamza Pasha to eliminate Vlad Dracula. Vlad Dracula however planned an ambush. Hamza Pasha, the Bey of Nicopolis, brought with him 10,000 cavalry and when passing through a narrow pass north of Giurgiu, Vlad Dracula launched a surprise attack. The Christians had the Muslims surrounded and defeated and almost all of them were caught and impaled, with Hamza Pasha impaled on the highest stake to show his rank. Impalement was Vlad Dracula’s preferred method of torture and execution and it was this which makes him stand out in being remembered as absolutely evil and barbaric. Impalement is the penetration of an organism by an object such as a stake, pole, spear or hook, by complete (or partial) perforation of the body, often the central body mass. What they would do is get a very long stick, make sharp one end and insert it through a person’s back passage, driving it through their body until it came out of their mouth. Often, the victims would be alive and this is how they would be killed. Then they would put this stick into the ground and impale others, putting them next to each other. Massacres In the winter of 1462, Vlad Dracula crossed the Danube and devastated the entire Bulgarian land in the area between Serbia and the Black Sea. Disguising himself as Turkish, utilising the fluent Turkish he had learned whilst under the care of the Muslims, he infiltrated and destroyed Ottoman camps. In a letter to Corvinus of Hungary, he wrote: “I have killed peasant men and women, old and young… We killed 23,884 Turks (Muslims) without counting those whom we burned in homes or the Turks whose heads were cut by our soldiers… Thus, your highness, you must know that I have completely broken any peace with him (Sultan Muḥammad Fātiḥ).” Vlad Dracula’s attack was celebrated by the then western Christendom; the Saxon cities of Transylvania, the Italian states and the Pope. A Venetian envoy, upon hearing about the news at the court of Corvinus, expressed great joy and said that the whole of Christianity should celebrate Vlad’s successful campaign. The Genoese from Caffa also thanked him. In response to this, Sultan Muḥammad Fātiḥ raised an army of around 60,000 troops and 30,000 irregulars, and in spring of 1462 headed towards Wallachia. This army was under the Sultan’s commandership and in its ranks was his friend and brave Mujāhid, Radu. Vlad Dracula was unable to stop the Ottomans from crossing the Danube on June 4, 1462 and on entering Wallachia, they found that on one of the very long roads leading to the capital of this area were 20,000 Muslims impaled along the sides of these roads. Imagine this, we suffer today no doubt but incidents of such brute are very rare indeed. You can imagine how Sultan Muḥammad Fātiḥ felt to see even one Muslim killed which was too much to bare, but to mutilate their bodies after this was something, which was beyond acceptable. Vlad Dracula constantly organised small attacks and ambushes on the Muslims and adopted what we would call today ‘Guerrilla warfare’. Pausing for a moment and thinking of the current state of the Muslim world, it is clear that it is now the Muslims who usually adopt guerrilla tactics in view of their weakness and inferior military might whereas Muslims were in the time of Muḥammad Fātiḥ, the superpower of the day. The End Game After some time, Radu, who remained faithful to Islām and the Sultan and spent his entire life on the frontlines of Jihād and battle in protection of the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire, was charged with the responsibility of pursuing his brother and thus showing the world that in Islām, brotherhood in faith is given priority over blood relations where they have an enmity towards the faith. Vlad Dracula was running out of funds and returned to Hungary to seek help from Corvinus, who instead of helping Vlad Dracula, imprisoned him as he was seen as a liability even for the Christians. In his absence, Radu defeated the remnants of Vlad Dracula’s army and became the ruler in Wallachia and he ruled from 1463-1473 when he died at the age of 40. Meanwhile, Vlad Dracula was released from prison and he returned to Wallachia once again and retook power in 1476 with Hungarian support. He immediately assembled an army and invaded Bosnia, slaughtering its Muslim population and impaling 8,000 on stakes in a forest of human bodies. Vlad Dracula had arisen from the darkness with the objective of eliminating Islām from the Balkans once and for all and installing Christianity. Sultan Muḥammad Fātiḥ invaded Wallachia and faced the forces of Vlad in Bucharest, Romania. Vlad’s army was overrun in a blitz and all were killed, including Vlad himself. His head was removed from his body and was taken back to Istanbul. They impaled his head and put it at the gates of Islambul where it stood for about 2 – 3 months to send a clear message to others. “If you want to be like this man, then dare wage war against us.” Points to note This was the demise of Dracula and again as Muslims, most of us will not even know about this. How many people even know that Dracula was a real man? It is very important that we do not allow distractions such as this new film’s fictitious rewriting of history to shape our understanding of what really happened. The film is truly shocking in its attempt to rewrite history, in portraying a man who was truly barbaric and brute in nature, as a brave man and a hero. They seek to show that his war with the Muslims started because he was seeking to protect his children, which of course is far from the truth; this was a man who did not care about family. What is more insulting and offensive is that by portraying Vlad as a hero, they are portraying his enemies, the Muslims as being barbaric and thereby also insulting the great man whom the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu ‘alayhi wasallam) had spoken about, Sultan Muḥammad Fātiḥ. Many Muslims had tried before Muḥammad Fātiḥ to be the best commander ever as prophesied in the Hadith by attempting to conquer Constantinople for over eight hundred years, making ten attempts. Among them were some of the greatest men whose names shine as bright stars including ‘Uthman b. ‘Affan (radiyAllāhu‘anhu), Mu’awiyah b. Abū Sufyān (radiyAllāhu‘anhu), Abū Ayyūb al-Ansari (radiyAllāhu‘anhu) who was martyred and buried there, Sulaymān b. ʿAbd al-Mālik, Harun al-Rashīd, and many Muslim commanders from the age of the Umayyad Caliphate, ‘Abbasid Caliphate and also the ‘Uthmāni Caliphate. This was a man whom when asked about his capabilities and how he managed the conquest, replied: “I have two traits: 1) a heart as hard as a rock that does not rest until I achieve what I want; (2) an eye that cries out of fear of Allāh jalla wa’ala. So how could I not achieve victory?” It was to defend his honour, raḥimahu Allāhu (may Allāh’s mercy be upon him), and that of the Muslims who were martyred at the hands of the Dracula, may Allāh grant them all Jannah (Paradise), that caused me to write this article. Unfortunately, we find certain desperate, lowly movements in the West through the many weapons in their armoury, including the make-believe propaganda tool that is Hollywood, demeaning this noble champion of Islām whilst upholding a bloodthirsty savage who committed many atrocities against humanity and in doing so, they legitimise his crimes and not a word of condemnation will you find being uttered from their lips. It would be inconceivable that a film be made to depict Hitler as a hero but yet the Muslim community is hated so blindly by some in today’s society that not many will even see this issue in that context. As a New Statesman article recently put it: “The vilification of Islām has reached such heights that when the Sultan Muḥammad Fātiḥ is cast opposite history’s bloodiest psycho-tyrant, it’s Dracula who emerges as the tragic hero [5].” What is apparent from the film is that it recreates evil as good and good as evil. It reaffirms the narrative which is prevalent in current times and the strategy deployed against Muslims. Aa famous statement from Malcolm X (raḥimahu Allāhu) comes to mind when he said: “If you are not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” So there you have it. You will often hear the saying that garlic kills a ‘Dracula’ or a silver bullet or a wooden stake through the heart – of course none of these killed Dracula. Indeed it was the Muslims who killed the Dracula. Let this serve as a reminder to the many bloodthirsty Draculas we have in our midst today, that if anyone wants to follow his way, they too will face the same wrath from the Muslims until justice is restored for all of humanity. We are not afraid of one desperate film changing anything, for it is Allāh that determines what legacy is left for each person—it is no coincidence that this Dracula has and always will be remembered as a monstrous, blood-sucking vampire, by people all over the globe. And likewise, Muḥammad Fātiḥ will always be known as the victor.",5,2,NasWarGaming,hZFZxEnB7ws,0.040386775922490195,2014-10-22 21:52:41,False,True

2014-10-25T17:35:15,"A review of the movie would be appropriate aside from a seething mass of arguments over Vlad.  I'll put it this way: This movie is unimaginably good if you're a vampire fan. If not, it's still good enough to peek your attention, you won't be wasting your money if you visit the cinema for this. It does have references to 300 and Game of Thrones (and I don't mean just the cast). Several clishees appear and some characters don't act like you would want it or at least as a vampire fan you would expect better. It's got good action and decent fight scenes... well, aside from the abuse of bat powers that confuse the crap out of the viewer. It's pretty straightforward, it doesn't confuse you, it doesn't create a sense of mystery or fear as you would expect, that does make it kinda boring, but at least its not like Prometheus, where every 5 seconds causes unnecessary questions and confusion.",2,0,Galejro,hZFZxEnB7ws,0.026620370370370343,2014-10-25 17:35:15,False,True

Seeing as It was Vlad Dracula and Radu who were taken away as wards for the Sultan. That is where Dracula comes from, the 'a' signifies him as the son of Vlad Dracul, not Vlad Dracul himself. Just calling him Vladislav Dracul II was too mainstream.  Also, people saying that this is stupid because he wasn't a hero or because Vampires are not heroes, from the looks of things he is not a hero in this. In fact, more than from the looks of things, it specifically states it in the narration. And seeing as this is, rather, about his father rather than The Impaler himself, I do not see why it matters whether you consider Vlad Tepes a hero or not, although, if anything he was an anti-hero, setting impalement to be the punishment for every crime, no matter now small, may not seem ""just"" but it certainly fixed the crime-rate and made the justice system simpler. And the 20,000 Turkish prisoners-of-war he impaled were invaders after all, it was in defence of his country, even if impaling them all to send a message was a bit extreme and even if he did still loose in the end.

Vlad's brother, Radu the Handsome, died many years earlier and had been replaced on the Wallachian throne by another Turkish candidate, Prince Basarab the Elder, a member of the Dăneşti clan. When Vlad's army arrived, Prince Basarab's army fled, some to the Turks, others in the mountains. After placing Vlad on the throne, Stephen Báthory and his forces returned to Transylvania, leaving Vlad in a very weak position. Vlad had little time to get support before a large Turkish army entered Wallachia to put Prince Basarab back on the throne. Vlad had to meet the Turks with the small forces at his disposal, which were made up of fewer than four thousand men. Vlad III declared his third reign in 26 November 1476, where it had lasted little more than two months and thereafter he was killed. According to profs. McNally & Florescu, Vlad Dracula was killed in battle.[12]  There are five variants of Vlad's death. Some sources[who?] say he was killed while having sex with one of the Turks surrounded by the bodies of his loyal Moldavian bodyguards. Others say he was killed by disloyal Wallachian boyars also in the war against the Turks, or during a hunt. Lastly, other reports claim that Vlad was accidentally killed by one of his own men. The exact date of Vlad's death is unknown, presumably the end of December 1476, but it is known that he was dead by 10 January 1477. The exact location of his death is also unknown, but it would have been somewhere along the road between Bucharest and Giurgiu.[citation needed]  According to Bonfinius (Antonio Bonfini) and a Turkish chronicler,[13]Vlad was decapitated by the Turks as a trophy, and his head was sent to Constantinople (now Istanbul) preserved in honey. After, the head was displayed on a stake as proof that he was dead.  Burial[edit] Vlad's body was buried unceremoniously by his rival, Basarab Laiota, possibly at Comana, a monastery founded by Vlad in 1461.[14] The Comana monastery was demolished and rebuilt from scratch in 1589.[15] FAKİNG İDİOTS",2,1,Kim Ibra Him,hZFZxEnB7ws,-0.012034386485612315,2014-11-19 19:58:33,False,True

2015-02-12T19:56:05,"The truth is people don't really know much about Vlad the Impaler. He wasn't exactly the person he is portrayed to be. He didn't kill for pleasure, he killed because he had to.  You see, Romania has always been a small country surrounded by big empires, like the Russian, the Ottoman and the Austro-Hungarian. We were a very rich country in resources and had very good land for agriculture and that's why all of these empires had made our people's lives miserable. They were making our people slaves, they were taking tributes from us more than we could afford and if we wanted a better life, they just invaded our country to take them by force.  In the battles, they had armies at least 3-4 times bigger than ours and they had trained soldiers meanwhile, we had mostly simple peasants. This is why people like Vlad the Impaler, Stephen the Great or Mircea the Elder are the greatest characters in our history. Because, unlike other cowards, they stood for their country (by the way, back then Romania was divided in 3 regions). Stephen the Great even won 46 out of 48 battles against the Turks. Can you believe what a big achievement this is? With armies full of peasants, they beat the Turks' armies of hundreds of thousand of trained soldiers.  About Vlad the Impaler, yes, he had very cruel strategies, but in the end, this was the only way to protect his country. It is said that during his reign, you could have left a bag full of gold in the middle of the street and the next day, you would find it in the exact same place, because every little crime was punished with death by impale. His tactics managed to keep order in the country and scare the Turks armies who were coming after us because every single one of them caught alive had a long and painful death. Say what you want about his tactics but he withstood and defeated the big Ottoman Empire with them.  And I don't really understand why are the Turks so proud about controlling Romania in the past. You had millions of soldiers. We had a few ten housands and still some of our great leaders defeated you several times. And because of your big ambitions, your empire fell in the end and you became a normal country just like us.   PS: Just search on google those people I mentioned earlier and you will see many more interesting things.",1,0,Stefan,hZFZxEnB7ws,0.11864431486880467,2015-02-12 19:56:05,False,False

2016-02-03T00:39:03,"Who proud of Dracula? He was asshole. He was not only killing Ottoman soldiers but also people from anywhere. One day, dracula wanted to give a food party to poor people of romania and all of these poor people came to his castle to eat. Dracula burned all of these poor people without mercy. Another disgusting example is; Dracula was killing his wife's babies during pregnant. He was cutting his wife's stomach to kill babies. He kills people and watches their dead with pleasure. A Ottoman Sultan, whose name is Fatih Sultan Mehmed II,  he heard about this things and dracula evil, he sent a message(by ottoman soldiers) to dracula to come to Istanbul and he directly killed those soldiers and burned them badly and also dracula is famous for drinking Ottoman Turks bloods. Dracula killed number of Ottoman Soldiers at that time. When ottoman sultan mehmed heard about this, he got so angry and decided to kill him. Around 200,000 Ottoman soldiers with Fatih Sultan Mehmed went to Romania and tried to kill him there. Ottoman Soldiers killed around 7000 of dracula soldiers out of 10000. Dracula escaped to Hungary and Hungarian king arrested dracula. Dracula put in jail and he remained there for a long time. After some time, some of the European countries started to make a pressure to Hungary to free Dracula from Prison. Hungary King decided to free Dracula and at that time, Ottoman soldiers were already looking for him. He was caught somewhere by Ottoman Janissaries and directly they cut his head off. Dracula's head was sent to Ottoman Sultan so sultan can make sure that he was dead. After that, His head hanged around the Istanbul to show the world.   Interesting fact, Dracula grew up with Ottoman Fatih Sultan Mehmed II, dracula was close friend of Sultan. They went through the same education etc.. After some years, Ottoman Sultan decided to send him to Romania so he can rule them. But Dracula's brain is washed by some people in that country and he suddenly turned into evil and started to kill particularly Turks and other people with incredible violation Technics. I think, dracula was looking for avenge against Ottomans. He was non-muslim despite he grew up in Ottoman Empire. He was holding secret hate against Ottomans. Finally, Ottoman Sultan punished him.
