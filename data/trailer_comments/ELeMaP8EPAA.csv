Yani fragmanda g√∂rd√ºƒü√ºm√ºz ≈üu: 0:19 DiCaprio aksiyon sahneleri, hƒ±zlƒ±ca g√∂receƒüimiz flashback anlarƒ± olacak b√ºy√ºk ihtimalle :/ Umarƒ±m √∂yle olmaz da Kill Bill'de ki gibi uzun uzun aksiyon sekanslarƒ±yla izleyiciyi tƒ±ka basa doyurur Tarantinocuƒüumuz :) 2- Ve yine tahminimce; bu filmde, Charles Manson lavuƒüunun, ki lavuk ≈üu oluyor: 1:09  m√ºritleri, ki m√ºritleri de ≈üunlar oluyor: 0:46 Sharon Tate'i ve arkada≈ülarƒ±nƒ± katledemeyecekler. Brad Pitt ve Leo DiCaprio yeti≈üip kurtarak onlarƒ± yani en azƒ±ndan bazƒ±larƒ±nƒ±.  Ger√ßekte olanlar bu filmde olmayacak yani bence.

Bence Bruce Usta, Brad ile d√∂v√º≈üt√ºƒü√º ≈üu sahnede: Brad'in karaktere 1 in√ßlik yumruk'u (one inch punch) √∂ƒüretecek ve Brad de bu tekniƒüi filmin sonunda kullanacak k√∂t√º adamlara kar≈üƒ± :) Kill Bill Vol.2 de ki ""5 nokta vuru≈üu"" hesaabƒ± ;) Ve Bruce o sahne harici bi daha g√∂z√ºkmeyecek :/ Umarƒ±m √∂yle olmaz da b√ºy√ºk ksvgs da o da yardƒ±m eder esas √ßocuklara.  4- Ha unutmadan filmde √ßalmasƒ±nƒ± beklediƒüim bir ≈üarkƒ± var o da The Beatles'ƒ±n Helter Skelter ≈üarkƒ±sƒ±.

Poor Stephen Parant, 16 years old and driving out of the property after visiting someone who lived in the guest house when he came across Tex Watson.   I was also 16 years old and I could not fathom somebody doing that to a pregnant woman. I loved Sharon Tate in the movie The Wrecking Crew. She was so funny. She was gorgeous of course, and she was playing a bit of a bimbo, but she played it with impeccable comic timing and a real sweetness and vulnerability.   I never forgot the aerial image of that property on Cielo Drive Nor did I ever forget Roman Polansky‚Äôs gut wrenching Press conference that week.   I have read books about the case. It shattered the optimism, the hope, the stars in our eyes about the future.   The case seem med to blow up everything. And, as Joan Didion so amazingly wrote in her book, The White Album, paraphrasing here: I felt nauseous the rest of that summer and into the fall. When my doctor asked me why I thought that was, I said, ‚ÄúI think nausea is a pretty understandable reaction to this summer.‚Äù  I loved the 60s in so many ways.

Some drugged up and delusional hippies broke into someone's home and killed a bunch of people. How is this funny? I get that Pitt and Dicaprio are playing some goof balls that stumble into the murders but the whole tone of this is pretty disrespectful and offensive. I am dismayed as to why this is a comedy instead of a dark thriller. This should be serious, not a feel good romp through the past. Tarantino has been making some strange decisions as he got older from Pulp Fiction. It's like he became a dad of four and now is trying to be funny. I'm a life long Tarantino fan, I've seen them all, but I just don't get this. If someone can explain to me how a movie about REAL EVENTS including breaking an entering, murdering multiple defenseless women, and Manson raping countless women through coercion and a drug fueled Messiah complex is not a serious thing we should learn from and keep from repeating but is instead a AAA feel good comedy romp?

The story seemed slightly bleak or empty w sharon tates event leading up as a backdrop, and its basically a behind the scenes experience and callback to old shows and styles of movie making. Its enjoyable dont get me wrong i dont think its tarantinos best and i think i need to rewatch the ending before saying this for sure but i thought it just needed a slight change i wont spoil what - just thought it was a little over the top and not in the right kind of ridiculous way - certain things worked well but i thought it coulda had a bigger bang",2,0,JasonVoorhees10100,ELeMaP8EPAA,0.07644927536231884,2019-07-26 05:57:58,False,True

2019-08-16T10:49:03,"I loved Tarantino's love letter to the lost cinematic world of his youth.  If you're of his generation/s, you'll get those in-jokes- the (always) beautiful little female child who starred in the Western tv series & brought a catch to the throat of the most hardened gun-slingers. This film is all about those memories & he weaves a story around them just as much as the more famous sub-plot around Sharon Tate's tragic end.  Di Caprio genuinely surprised me - he was superb. Not afraid to play old, grizzly, fartacious & a bit ugly.His roaring at himself for his boozing was a tour-de-force & any boozer will recognise a little bit of themselves in the maudlin self-pity veering to furious denouncement vering back to pious self-justication. Pitt didn't have to much except be Brad Pitt- avuncular. There is a fascinating back-story to his character- a question left hanging by Tarantino.  As all the best films do- Once Upon A Time in Hollywood asks more questions than it answers.  It's a fairy tale where Tarantino gets to 'kill' real characters that many of us will have wished had been killed before they managed to carry out their truly evil 'mission'.  In this sense, Tarantino is like a kid of 14, playing at 'saving' Tate but in a way that resounds with love across the years.  We see Tate herself, & Robbie playing Tate, watching the real Tate in a 'Matt Helm', Dean Martin lost 60s' caper-comedy.  There is something really rather moving about these scenes, seeing Tate emerge into a world that quite rightly loved her & knowing as we do her fate- the pathos is almost unbearable.  All fans of the magic of cinema, should do themselves a favour & go see this film.",2,1,Paula Fay,ELeMaP8EPAA,0.24621212121212122,2019-08-16 10:49:03,False,True

Then he says that he will never knock a cops jaw out again because he didn't want to go to a specific prison in Texas again.     Then he brutally beats and humiliates a guy from the Charles Manson Family at the Spahn Ranch, because the guy stuck a knife into Rick Dalton's car deck.     And the ending... yeah that explains itself haha jeez.     He also has a very bad scar on his shoulder (Wonder where he got it from, that gives us something to think about).

2019-08-22T22:11:52,"Bad film. Really bad. And I never say that about a Tarantino movie, ever. He is a brilliant writer and director, but he fell massively short on this one.  This film is jumpy, goes back and forth constantly - making the viewer confused about where you are in the story. It's largely plotless, nothing really has a point or reason. There are long nonsensical conversations that culminate in nothing (when Tarantino previously did this, it would lead to something in future, there was a reason for everything). The ending is over the top and ridiculous, seemingly for the sake of it - again, with no purpose (Tarantino is usually over the top and ridiculous, with a comedic take on things - he's essentially a comedy writer, but the ending feels like he's trying to achieve this vibe but without the creative ties at the end).   Look, maybe I misunderstood it, or went in with a pre conceived idea. Maybe I didn't pay enough attention, or maybe I didn't pick up on Tarantino's references. But I found this movie a waste, and was very surprised with how cliche it was (by cliche I don't mean the obviously intentional cliche, I meant the way in things were presented), it felt more like someone imitating Tarantino as opposed to the man himself.  I enjoyed the different style in this film, and appreciated what he appeared to be aiming to do - but this is the first of all of Tarantino's films I really did not enjoy, and in fact wanted to leave the cinema I was so bored.  I would suppose that he's right - all directors lose it after a certain amount of films. Maybe he has.",1,1,Archetype00,ELeMaP8EPAA,0.027895658263305333,2019-08-22 22:11:52,False,True

2019-09-02T11:49:44,"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood   There always will be quite a few twists, humour coated, with a pun or pinch or a smirk in Tarantino movies.  Delivering those twists is his joy in making movies primarily, IMHO. Often he likes to gloat (my guess) over those presentations, at times in an obscured manner. That is classically quality of fine art making,.   Where Tarantino pushes his presentations into controversy, is not necessarily in the fashion of his presentation, rather the ratio of twists and the envelopes the twists are delivered in. The little implicit themes or morals he might have wanted to deliver VS what other items he chose to have them packed with, that particular ratio is most often getting in the way of making his movies more favoured or easily accepted by those who have opposed or resented.   For example, Kill Bill the first or the second, the extent and scale and nature of violence presented, could become trying for some.  All those I know personally to be his fans, would still claim, Pulp Fiction to be his greatest, whereas I would not consider Django Unchained to be lesser than all of his creations put together. To put this politely, had he not done Django, I would never quite be impressed, might have liked his work at best.  Yes, there in Django, he really delivered themes that are most uncommon, presented in most uncommon way, and ..   .‚Ä¶ Let us not make it a Django Unchained essay.   So, watched the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, as I had entered by chance, had no knowledge of the movie or the plot, or the cast, apart from Tarantino made it.   Only after 30th minute I figured out which real life story it was built upon and what Tarantino was building in his version.  As I had said, often Tarantino puts too much in the package to present his core theme(s), and this was another example.   His regular humour twists were there, the odd marvels of mimicking, .. His regular facades ...... By no means I would ever find it acceptable for anyone to consider this movie to be any lesser than outstanding. Finesse of cinematography, acting, .. Light, camera and action all at their best ..   But the truly outstanding obscured theme he had hidden in that crafty woodwork, the length of all the movie to get to that bit was overburdening. Many would probably get bored and disappointed, perhaps leave the hall halfway, or lose concentration, or even lose hope if not paying attention thoroughly having confidence in his creativity.   I did not, simply because, Django did my jingle, I know, what the man is capable of, and he would not disappoint us By the Holy Woods in the woodwork, he did not.  I took back all the grudge I might have had until the last 20 minutes of the movie.  By the Woods, he really packed it so neatly, the theme was so finely woven, I am yet to read one comment to date which pointed to the every of the marvelous twists ..  He really did it.  The series of twists Tarantino packed were many,   1. From movie makers, producers, actors and hands of movie-world, average families .. All regularly followed the TV series ""The FBI""  2. Spaghetti Western had been Dalton's means of survival, or financially he might have struggled more, which brought the other twist, Hollywood in transition, big role of western was a dying act, as the latter generation were opening new horizon, and even ""dirty movies were also getting premiers"" .. So was noted  3. The fact that Dalton had bought a house in Hollywood and not rented, was more essential for him, he had to feel local and that for him was helping his confidence to survive during hard times. That notion itself had been outdated, but he was not aware. He was having second thoughts once he was finished with Spaghetti Western success, he had to consider more financial preventative measures. This actually had also changed in the new era, for the latter generation who thought and lived otherwise, Sharon Tate, Polanski, Sebring .. In real life, were renting at that time.   4. The cars parked at the two driveways of these neighbours, also portray more characters of the two worlds. Dalton's driveway, typical Cadillac de Ville and Booth's poorly maintained Karmann Ghia. .Polanski had a classy old MG, and Sharon a Porsche. And the scene was there, Dalton driving Booth's Karmann, in a reckless mode, gushing his frustration of not belonging to Polanski's class. (Owning a Karmann today would have whole different picture though)  All so many nitty gritty twists Tarantino succeeded with, Trudi's sessions, Trudi being thrown to the floor, the entire scenario, simply brilliant.   Where the movie really gets to the ""core twist"", the stem of this entire production. Tex and Squeaky in the car before the invasion attempt.   The other side of the coin.   The alleged Dalton, guilty on grounds of teaching violence to American society.   The twist of the entire Manson Family controversy.  Also the counterfactuals, what if they actually had attacked the next door by mistake.   The Manson Family, ""the little children"" trying to play witch-hunt. We are not going into the debate of the validity of their convictions or aspirations. Exoneration is only absolute to the mortal eye, when one side of the coin is visible  What they had attempted, violence they only saw by means of Hollywood productions, the irony of encountering them in real life had been far beyond any imagination they could usher just by experiencing them from Hollywood movies. When it came to real life brutality, Hollywood seasoned, actors and hands were accustomed to, more habituated, more comfortable with execution, which the Mason Family could not get themselves to begin with.   For it was Hollywood - the virtual world of Hollywood, that taught violence, and the more intimate ones were more naturalized by all means than Manson little children could fathom.   Those final 20 minutes of super emphasis on sensitive scenes of violence Tarantino pulled the movie through to deliver the twist with precision, in most appropriately proportioned violence and for that, the precision in the violence presentation was needed. Amazingly, all of it with great sound and camera, yet somewhere there was a 1970's movie feel to it, as if all the technology was borrowed from that era.   And immediately after, Dalton and Sebring into a casual tone of conversation, ‚Ä¶ says all that needed for that twist to prove its point.",0,0,Asif Iqbal,ELeMaP8EPAA,0.17711566888396152,2019-09-02 11:49:44,False,True

Leonardo, over & over forgetting his non-sensical lines with no background bar patron chatter or atmosphere, have the bar owners daughter actually come down & play the dam fiddle, anything to make the scene a little more interesting as it dragged on forever.   Why were we first to leave the Playboy mansion just as it was getting fun ?  Following Margo, wondering around aimlessly, like she was lost, in knee high white boots & a long sleeve black sweater, while on the strip, mid-day, bright sunshine, summer hot, no wonder she lost the boots once inside the theatre.   Leonardo sweating profusely in his winter apparel, dyed Custer leather jacket & this heavy corduroy pull over sweat-shirt, as if the wardrobe department was playing a joke on him.    Why all this bravado about how we turned the strip into 1969,  L.A with no CGI., then mix in all this CGI vintage action film footage in Italy or not even close to looking realistic, plays Steve McQueen in the Great Escape & finally streamline, lengthen the fantastic song choices are just a few obvious suggestions.    Quentin edited 4 hours of film down to 2 hours & 40 minutes, one only wonders what was left on the cutting room floor as Margo never got in the pool at the mansion per the trailer?

2019-11-23T18:47:07,"i'm not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but there are two DISTINCT epochs of tarantino film. there's pre-""inglorious bastards"" and post-""inglorious bastards"".  comical violence & shock-value were utilized MUCH more before ""inglorious"". also, those films' themes were fantastical. more, character development was NOWHERE near as refined.  once ""revisionist history"" was introduced, the stories became vastly more compelling. it would appear, at a glance, tarantino's films transitioned from fictitious ROMANTICizations to factual REALISMs. however, this isn't the case. the same storytelling remains, but is this time, grounded by historicity.  films prior to ""inglorious"" are set, roughly, within the same time period they were released. the audience, thus, views those films from the perspective that the starring characters are of the same FOUNDATIONAL reality. the audience is merely observing unique adventures within the same world. this is how film, from a psychological perspective, is interpreted by the mind.  ""alternate reality"" movie scenarios are mostly employed by fantasy/sci-fi/futurist flicks. ""revisionist history"", however, is particularly compelling because it utilizes the same theoretical principle in a believable manner. historical accuracies (clothing/architecture) coupled with abstract imaginings (characters/events), make such films educational in demeanor but entertaining in spirit! for lack of a better phrase, such a genre could be aptly called REALISTic ROMANTICISM.  ùòñùò£ùò™ ùòãùò¢ùòØ ¬©2019",0,0,Up On The Hill Ent.,ELeMaP8EPAA,0.1827956989247312,2019-11-23 18:47:07,False,False

2020-01-24T16:49:43,"I didn‚Äôt like this movie as much the second go round. I think a big part was just the anticipation and tension that builds up throughout the film watching the first time cause you have no clue where the ending is gonna lead.   Well now that I know the ending and watching it a 2nd time I thought I‚Äôd enjoy it more. But I didn‚Äôt. Quite the opposite in fact. The dialogue just isn‚Äôt that interesting or as dynamic as you‚Äôd see in movies like Inglorious Basterds or Pulp Fiction. The plot is very weak!!   It really feels like 90% of the movie is just ‚Äúfluff‚Äù. It‚Äôs just random scenes that cut back and forth from other tv shows and movies the character Rick Dalton has starred in previously. For the first 30 minutes the only thing that happens is Rick meets with a producer who tells him to make a career change or its over for him. That‚Äôs it! But it takes 30 minutes just to get to that point, cause the film has to cut to every reference that Rick has starred or every exposition that leads to this conversation. And that‚Äôs MOST of this film. It‚Äôs just a few events happening with TON of backstory and exposition piled on. All Tarantino films do this, but this film just had the sense that it was done overboard and used as filler to draw out the tension between the interactions with the Manson family and the cuts to Sharon Tate.   That‚Äôs the other complaint. The character of Sharon Tate. She served no narrative purpose! She literally has barely any interaction with the main characters or the plot as a whole. The ONLY reason she is in the film is because WE the audience know the foreshadowing going into the film of that she was killed by the Manson Family in real world. The tension works the first time viewing the film because the entire 2hour run this thought stays with you the entire time. You KNOW she gets killed but the anticipation of how that is going to happen is the excitement you feel the first time watching the film.   Once you know the story and the events that unfold, you realize, once again that Sharon Tate‚Äôs characters is just more ‚Äúfluff‚Äù. There‚Äôs really no need for her character.

Good performances, yes (Pitt was phenomenal, Leo was great, and that little 8yo girl was fantastic). Good cinematography, yes. Good script, yes. However, Margot Robbie's character was incredibly underused. And why was so much time spent on multiple scenes that went absolutely nowhere? The final 10 minutes of the movie should have come 30min earlier.   *Examples..* When Sharon (Robbie) went into the theater and watched her movie, why did we have to sit and watch that for 10min? Or when Cliff drives, why do we have to see everywhere he goes? Or when Cliff went to the Manson farm, why was there all that build up for some big reveal to just have it lead to nothing? Or when Cliff and Rick spend a good 10min sitting in front of a tv, examining their performances in past roles, why did we have to watch that?  Don't get me wrong, I love a good slow-burn movie when it's executed well. I just found myself more frustrated with scenes that acted like they would go somewhere, and then just drop off.

The fairytale essentially is how Hollywood REWRITES history and when you realize that everything in the movie makes much more sense.

The best part of the movie is when brad pitt goes to visit his old friend in his house infested by cheap prostitutes.

They have always been described as that.  The hippy movement was opposed to violence and the Vietnam War.  Peace and Love was their motto.  Manson posed as a hippy but in reality he was an ex convict who had learned how to manipulate people while in prison.  He was an admirer of Hitler and wanted to start a race war between blacks and whites.  Manson was angry because Terry Melcher would not give him a recording contract so this was probably him taking his frustrations out on other people and a warning to Melcher.  The Manson family have always been used against the flower power era.  Yet there was a lot of violence, rape torture and death in Vietnam at the time.  Both the Vietnamese and US soldiers were killed and maimed.

However, his best friend and stuntman is always there for him!  Sometimes the years change before our eyes, but when passion and dedication is still active, hope never dies and we overcome the hard times.  Rick Dalton never gave up through a changing Hollywood and even took risks he never thought possible by going across the pond.   As the film progresses, the ending was such a great scene to see!  Brandy stole the show by saving the night and placing justice; such a great ending to a very classical and amazing film that will forever remain in the history books.
