2017-03-16T03:13:39,"So, are there any original writers left in Hollywood? Yet another remake? (1979 - George Burns, Art Carney). Guess at least they re-made something that many won't know as it is old enough that the originals are dead and even obscure to audiences today as recognized actors. So unlike many remakes today as the original actors are potentially young enough to reprise the original roles themselves as even a late sequel. Still, does anybody have an original script anymore or do they just turn in a note that says that they thought a re-make/reboot of something would be great? Even one of the better sounding flicks coming out is Ghost In The Shell, and this isn't even original, just a live action adaptation of a (not new) Anime.

2017-07-31T13:14:59,"#EAPP2017 This movie is about a team up of three senior citizens who decided to rob a bank so that they could avenge their pension funds on a steel company that they worked for their entire lives. At first, it is only Joe Harding, acted by Michael Caine, has the interest to rob a bank because he's desperate to pay the bills for his family and the mortgage of his house. He, then tried to persuade his two friends, Willie Davis and Albert Garner (acted by Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin, respectively), who is also in trouble because of their pension money. The three of them started small by robbing a small grocery store for their dinner, but in the end the security guards caught them. So they tried to seek the help of an experienced criminal, they have trained their selves for 20 days and started making a solid alibi by using the senior fair. When the day has come they have begun to prepare and go to the fair and after that they changed their suits in a hidden place so that no one can notice them. They started robbing the bank with a mask, but at the middle of their robbery, a little girl is asking for help and then Willie tried to reach her so that he can see the problem. As soon as he got close to her, the little girl tried to remove the mask from him and the camera caught a glimpse of it. The police tried to imprison the three, but they have a solid alibi making them less suspicious. In the end, all their debts were paid and they even gave money on their own charity. This is a better movie than the 1979 version of this movie. The plot is better because they asked the help of a criminal than the older version where they struggled to train themselves. Most of the movie is so funny that you will forget the time and as expected from the director, Zach Braff, he added a little bit of drama to balance the whole movie.
