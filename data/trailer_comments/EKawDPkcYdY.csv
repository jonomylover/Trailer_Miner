2015-05-20T15:15:54,"I thought the first movie was terrible, but then I didn't like the Divergent movie either. I feel like making a movie series on popular YA novels is Hollywood's new cheat code. They already have a massive in- built audience who, even if the movie sucks, will still pay the money to see it and any sequels because they love the series and are desperately wanting to see something that does the book justice, and to Hollywood money equals sequels- even when they are not wanted. Now, I did not enjoy The Maze Runner or Divergent OR Hunger Games books- they all come off as the same generic plot to me, but I can't imagine that those who liked the books will be pleased by the way this movie series is going. I know people say 'obviously movies will be different than the books so stop bitching' BUT if you're going to use a book to movie adaptation to boost your sales, the least you can do is pay attention to the source material and not piss all over the fans that you're exploiting.
