And the king of tired hack, Adam Sandler, this born-again Jerry Lewis makes funny voices, wow.  Does he just sit around the house looking for objects to turn into movies...aaaaaa, wookie, wookie, my eyes see a remote control, there's a couple million in my pocket, yesirwee.  Oh look a Pac Man game, should I go on?  Americans really need to end their love affair with stupidity and demand better.  The most direct way to do this is by not spending money on the crap these guys produce.  James Franco, if you're out there, do yourself a favor and unhitch yourself from Rogen.  You actually have talent and drug use is not as rampant as Rogen would lead us to believe.  Have I left anybody out in the ""they only have one act"" comedy category?",0,0,Rick Noyb,ShIAH_G-Iuw,0.034782608695652174,2015-07-29 14:53:54,True,True
