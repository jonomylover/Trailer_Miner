Whose genius idea was this?""  Also,   ""Why can't I enjoy my singleplayer experience now?.. There is no pause available, so in this game, playing singleplayer is like playing multiplayer with invisible players, as all the online rules still apply to me only. Which means that if something in the real world demands my attention, I can not stop the game and continue it later, and if I have to do something quickly outside of the game, I'm destined to crash into something in game, or to lose the race or pursuit.

2014-01-08T14:36:26,"So lemme make a formula that would make people equally content, unless they really want to eliminate the other totally: 1: Cars - Tuners would be exclusive to many customization options including body kits, spoilers, neons, audio, and even custom headlights. Some of them are offroad capable while others are perfect drifters. - Musclecars would be the dragsters, and would be modified and upgraded as such. - Exotics would be the top speed (Not acceleration like Muscles, or Grip like Tuners) custom rims, and custom paint job, and performance upgrades are minimal, but would not go further than that, being what they are. 2: racing - Urban and rural, enough said. I mean, why not having both city racing and rural racing, with deserts, coastals, mountainsides, and other beautiful environments to sight-see? - Be-the-cop mode would be best with MW's pursuit system. Cruise, find a racer, arrest them with a squad of them, as others block the road. Order Rhinos, spikes, etc. 3: Online/offline - EA's tries to make online only nfs-es are getting old, especially with each race being so randomly selected. The reason we all loved Multiplayers was none of such nonsense, but the fact there was a race host, and the other players, and they decided together what race was next. Also, why not allowing players with no internet connection or will to race against other people, to play it offline? Ability to pause.",9,2,Grand Prince Vuk J.

And for those Exotic noobs who are going to rage about this, you have had more than enough games for you, Hot Pursuit, The Run, Most Wanted 2012, Rivals so you can shut up. And even you say ""There going back to there roots!"" the original NFS had only 2 Exotic cars, rest were surpas, Skylines and stuff like that. Since undercover I have not enjoyed the racing games you have made, I completed the Run in a DAY! IN A FRIKIN DAY! Why? Because I had the fastest cars at the start, no progression at all. I could drift easily, when i want to drift I want it to be in my own car and made it drift, not in a stock Hypercar which can do it by its self because that is for noobs who can't drive.   So please NFS, I and millions of need for speed fans are just asking to make Underground 3 for 2015. Why you? Because you are the best a customisation, The Underground's, 1 & 2, are the best selling games you have made.

These new nfs games are nice i have played them and there fun but its nit the same because you dont get to change or make your own car. Thats what makes nfs, nfs. In these nfs games you really cant change much of the car onky the kit and color and thats about all. At least the nfs's ive played. Back then you could make your car and drive it how you felt the car should look when its racing. Brakes,exhaust tips,hoods,spoilers,decals,headlights etc... Thats what make nfs really enjoyable and fun to play. I still got my underground game but i dont have a ps2 anymore but i keep it because it reminds me how much i enjoyed nfs and how it should be. Theyll make one theyll probably wont but they should because thats how it all started.   I not hating on these new nfs games yes there fun but its not the same.

Still I prefer Rivals instead of MW 2005, beacause: The cop chases are more intense with that fanct pursuit tech, plus your car can get totaled. I also love the map, the nature is lovely. When you speed above 300 kmh the feeling is more realistic, there is also no motion blur, to make you think you are fast af.
