He of course develops feelings for her under a false pretense, so she has to break his heart...but only after waiting so long, keeping him in suspense, making the heartbreak worse. She KNOWS who she really loves; she didn't need to wait. When the man who she loves tells her off for her falseness, she says, ""I won't have any man criticize me."" Sheesh. She made a mistake; she ought to own up to it. Then that soldier arrives. She knows him for two minutes, and she's already willing to meet him secretly in the woods. He says, ""Do you trust me,"" and she says, ""Yes"". Girl, you met him TWO MINUTES ago! You can't trust him. Then she gets some in the woods, and she's all like, ""Oooh, I love you, soldier."" Girl, you're infatuated, not in love. No wonder that marriage failed. On top of it all, she holds off on wedding the man she really loves until the very end, because he's poorer than her!
