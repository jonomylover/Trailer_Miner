I also hate movies that are simply reboots of movies that already exist, i.e Total Recall and the upcoming Robocop and Godzilla. BUT...this adaptation of The Planet of the Apes just blows my mind! The story is clever and explores the topic of human exceptionalism. When I heard that a sequel to RPA was in production I feared that it would simply be a stain on the reboot. But after watching this trailer I can say I have just a bit more hope that I will not be disappointed. Whereas a series like Iron Man releases movie after movie of the same plot with a new suit or in the case of Iron Man 3 a team of ""Ironmen"", DPA looks to expand upon its reboot in a way that will be much more fulfilling. Taking the idea of human exeptionalism introduced in the first film the sequel will turn the tables so to speak and reverse this idea. The ego of man will remain and humanity will fight to win back its title at the top of the food chain. I can't wait to see how events unfold.

2014-05-09T02:36:19,"Hey, I have been trolling the most popular YouTube websites for a while. I feel I just have to get the word out. The youth of America that will fight this fight bringing back the original US Constitution for the people getting rid of the US Constitution ‚Äì Corporation law. ¬†The invention and creation of US Constitution happen in the District of Delaware 1871. It identifying each person as a corporation asset putting into debt, enslaved removed of your original US Constitutional rights. The point and establish of this was to be done slowly over generations to fool the public and have a feeling of being natural. ¬† So many of you know might read my words and just think of it as crazy talk and exaggeration of what is going on. You have been raise in a FIAT currency system with a government that grows elevating its puppet politician‚Äôs power with higher wages at the same time increasingly higher inflationary products and every increasing distant RICH Corporation Banks and Leaders telling and influencing the politicians what to do via the Federal Reserve Bank. ¬† Let me tell you what is coming to the US and the world. First, as you read this may ignore it and you, wake and see the blue sky tomorrow and go to your job, may forget it, I understand. I understand you have been raise in this environment and it all feels natural, normal, typical, so my words come across strange and odd to you. ¬† ¬† What is coming is a new World Order lead by a few on top of the economic World Banking System of which no one will ever know or meet. They are the impossible rich, the Trillionaires. They secretly, hidden with their economic power will be in charge. They have been influencing our world for an extreme long time and because of their own economic distance from us, might as well see us as ants, bugs, animals to be used, exploited natural as the farmer uses his cows, sheep, chickens and other animals of his farm. They might be human, but they do not see us as the same as themselves, but something different. ¬† With this new World comes something good, which exist in our own US history a currency back by gold, a solid real value, minimal in manipulation of value. All Fiat, inflationary\public debt currencies of any country of the world, always fail, removing the freedom of its people and removing of their freedoms. ¬† This new world order is only dangerous, because they are the Trillionaires, a monopoly unto themselves, ¬†alienate themselves from humanity as something better as they control the future and exploit us all. The gold standard of value will come back and at the same time only a few tiny hubris people in charge of billions who are in charge. ¬† The problem now for the USA, is we are hubris as we approach and act on the world and this needs to change; this happen because of the Fiat currency. We believe the lie. We believe we politically we are as wonderful as the tall numbers we create in backless, worthless LARGE dollars. ¬† I am happen for the return of the gold standard as it returns a solid standard for value. What I want most important for the American people to know and remember. ¬†To research to understand, is our original US Constitution as it was written by our founders did not want a currency maintain by banks, but by the elected government itself and then it leaders as it created laws could always create laws motivated by the people for the people and considered the peoples FREEDOM FIRST! ¬† ¬†¬† When the US Currency fails this time around, do not fall to temptation and the whole of the country becomes depress as this cycle plays out for 10 years or longer. But to remember who we are and we DO HAVE A ORGINAL HISTORY OF THE US CONSTITION WITH A POLITICAL SYSTEM AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT WORKED FOR OVER 130 YEARS WITH ONLY 3% INFLATION AND THE FREEDOM OF THE PEOPLE WAS ALWAYS MOST IMPORANT!",0,0,Jeff Lee,3sHMCRaS3ao,0.08769536740315964,2014-05-09 02:36:19,True,True

They over did it on the CGI, there is no realness effect to this movie. Please, Hollywood, please PLEASE stop ruining good movies with awful CGI. Bring back actors in suits/costumes. You're ruining classics like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Planet of the Apes, etc. with CGI!!!!!!! There are a plethora of actors out there to play any role from Ewoks (Warwick Davis) to the Uber Immortal in 300 (Robert Maillet).

2014-05-10T14:46:59,"In the name of burned Odessa  People of the united Europe! On May 9, the anniversary of the Great Russian Victory over European fascism, a new generation of Russian people appeals to you.  We address you in the face of the new Nazi genocide organized by your Government.  You‚Äôve heard a lot about Ukraine and things happening there over the past six months. Almost everything that you‚Äôve heard from the official sources is a lie.  Ukraine is a former part of historical Russia. Ukraine is a vulnerable point of Russia. Elites of the EU and the U.S. have organized a Nazi takeover in Ukraine. There are torchlight processions. Jews are running away from there. The Russian are being killed there.  Right now, on a Victory over Fascism Day, the Russians are being killed in Ukraine. They‚Äôre being murdered for being Russian.  The world is accustomed to the fact that the West does not hesitate to kill for profit. Examples are innumerable ‚Äî Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya, Syria. We have always been against these wars of plunder. But today, the robbers came for Russia. And they had sent the Nazi murderers ahead of them.  These are not just hollow words. We want to show you, the people of Europe, what the Nazi henchmen of the EU and the U.S. have done with the Russian people.  THEY BURNED ALIVE OVER 40 PEOPLE.  => http://imgur.com/OdnJ853  On May 2, Odessa police, obeying to orders of Kiev ""euro integrators"", organized a provocation. The mysterious ""men in black with red ribbons"" from the employees of the junta police in the guise of ""pro-Russian column"", attacked the Ukrainian soccer fans with automatic weapons.  After that, the same people (without the red ribbons, but still with a weapon) were seen in the ranks of the Nazis attacking the House of Trade Unions.  As a result of the provocation, pro-Ukrainian terrorist organization ""Pravy sector"" have intercepted the control of the column of infuriated soccer fans. They attacked the peaceful camp of people collecting signatures ""For the federalization of Ukraine"" near Odessa House of Trade Unions.  => http://imgur.com/nyWGfpC  See for yourself: the camp was several kilometers away from the collision and the participants were not involved.  The camp at the House of Trade Unions consisted of:  - Anti-fascist Odessa youth (mostly students) - Women and retirees ‚Äî the eternal social activists, - and clerisy.  These harmless people were guarding the monument to Vladimir Lenin from attempts to topple it. They put a tent-chapel, a kitchen tent, a sunshade for collecting signatures. They were showing amateur performances to each other and standing with gouache posters on their quiet meetings.  => http://imgur.com/G2frORq  That‚Äôs what brutal fascist creatures, scenting the impunity, have done to them: they forced them into building, blocked the entrances and exits... AND BURNED THEM ALIVE.  They were just executed. In the 21st century. In a civilized country. Burned at the stake.  Fans led by the Nazis forced Russian old men, women and a few battle-worthy students into the House of Trade Unions.  Then they besieged all the entrances and exits, and set the central ones ablaze.  Then some of the people in the building were beaten to death. Nazis attempted to burn the bodies to conceal the beating marks. Some victims were left to burn to death or suffocate. And those who have leapt out of the windows were finished off by the mob on the ground.  When the smoke dissipated, the attackers entered the building for the second time. Some went on finishing the survivors, others were scouring on the floors, counting ""burned insects"" and examining their pockets. Finding icons, student IDs of Odessa universities, Ukrainian passports and mobile phones ‚Äî some were ringing. The Nazis took those phones and mockingly answered to the relatives of people they burned to death.  However, these monsters‚Äô wit does not cease even today. They are extremely scared and trying hard to hide their fear behind this ugly bravado. The same fear will inevitably drive them to new violence.  Fascism is back.  So come and see, European. The killers were supported by your Government. Don‚Äôt you dare to look away:  Here they are still alive ‚Äî Russian old men with red flags:  => http://imgur.com/AJqRraF  Here they are dying ‚Äî women and older men (The crowd below is shouting ""Burn, Russian!"" and when they fall down, the mob will be applauding):  => http://imgur.com/j0gmkCk  Here they are dead ‚Äî a woman and her unborn child:  => http://imgur.com/84ZCqcH  And here is how Mother and Child were assassinated: not by the flames, but by the human beings.  => http://ruposters.ru/archives/4746  People inside the building were beating this pregnant woman for a long time and then strangled her, screaming, with the electric wire. Then they threw the body in a deliberately mocking pose, and happily hung out the flag of Ukraine out of the window: ""moped up."" And other people shouted at them from a crowd below - responding to the woman‚Äôs feeble cries for help: ""Knock her out, it is not a woman!"" And just then there were people holding the fire trucks from putting the fire out.  There were as well a lot of people admiring the overkill. Thus, Yulia Tymoshenko expressed her personal gratitude to the maniacs who strangled the pregnant and burned alive the old. Remember that woman with a braid? Europe labeled her as ""dissident"", rescued her from a prison and provided treatment to her. Tymoshenko has already encouraged to burn tRussian before ‚Äî with ""nuclear weapons.""  WE, THE RUSSIAN YOUTH, WANT EUROPE TO FORM THE PICTURE OF UTMOST CLARITY: THE PREGNANT WOMAN WAS STRANGLED BY THE SOCCER FANS HEADED BY NAZIS.  THESE NAZIS WERE BROUGHT UP AND RAISED TO POWER BY YOU, EUROPEANS, BY THE ORDER OF THE USA.  On May 2, at the Odessa House of Trade Unions, the Nazis of junta and its faithful dog Yarosh, strangled the pregnant Odessa. They threw her body in a prominent place as a terrorist threat to all Russian still living in Ukraine.  This is done by those whom you, people of the European Union, officially support.  Everyday EU and US diplomats make statements of support for these murderers. In winter, they helped the junta to cover up an affair about snipers in Kiev, in spring they expect to help to hush up THE BURNING OF 40 INNOCENT RUSSIANS ALIVE.  Why is this necessary for junta?  Mother and Child were thrown as they were killed for a reason - to make photos. They want to create an atmosphere of terror and build the Western Ukrainians Nazi state with totalitarian oppression of the Russian minority (but there are more than 30% of Russians in Ukraine).  Now then, this is not going to happen. Russia will not tolerate Nazis close by. There will be a great war. And it‚Äôs going to be tough on everybody. And first of all - on ordinary Europeans.   Why the European Union should support the junta?  There‚Äôs absolutely no sense in this for the EU. American game in Kiev is being played by European officials serving their ¬´last day of grace¬ª before the election. Either they are Intimidated or bought, these bureaucrats are working against the interests of the people of Europe.  Russians are like this: they care not only for ¬´us¬ª but for ¬´them¬ª as well. Remember who saved the world from Hitler and Napoleon? Knowing this touch of Russian nature, the U.S. and European officials are provoking Putin to respond to the Ukrainian fascists and bring troops into the territory of Ukraine.  This is the American plan to fight the debt crisis: to start a new ¬´Cold War¬ª, if not the Third World War, and to write off all their flaws, population robbery and restriction of freedoms to the need of struggling with ""evil Russian plans.""  Keep in mind: Russians have no evil plans. We have only recently recovered from the collapse of our great country. But we just can not look on how they choke our people to death and burn them alive.  Why is this necessary for the USA?  As a result of retaliatory sanctions, Russia with its resources available to Europe, will be isolated. European Union will have to cross over to the shale gas from America.  The U.S. shale gas is almost double the price of gas from Russia. As a result of this jugglery, every ordinary European will have to pay the ""shale toll"" to the American banker and oilman for many years.  Moreover, without cheap Russian gas the industry of Europe will become much less profitable. This will allow the U.S. to finally destroy the economy of the European Union and economically enslave some of the countries.  We could stop here.  But we, Russians, are preparing for war, and we have to tell everything to the end.  Fascism is back. We are not blind. We saw its mug. We definitely recognized it. That's it. This is fascism, Nazism, the horror when monsters burn people alive.  Politicians who sent killers to Odessa  => Http://newsland.com/news/detail/id/1367794/  not only expressed gratitude for barbarism. They conduct a full-scale war in the east of Ukraine, near the revolting Sloviansk city. They use artillery and tanks, helicopters perform missile strikes.  Western media are silent about Odessa ‚Äî for them there ¬´was a fire¬ª and nothing more. Western media are silent about the East of Ukraine - missile attacks of town outskirts are called an ""anti-terrorist operation."" Western media pretend that people's lives worth nothing in front of the priceless ""conquest of democracy"" ‚Äî the right to elect the President for Ukraine among the murderers and rich swindlers subservient to the U.S. And to make it quick. Even before the coals of Odessa bonfire cool down.  Maybe this trick works with you, the people of Europe. But not with Russians.  We thoroughly collected all the evidence on the crime in Odessa: video, the murderers‚Äô boasting in social networks, shocking pictures. There‚Äôs no doubt: ¬´Russian camp¬ª in Odessa was destroyed deliberately and violently to scare Russian throughout Ukraine before the ""democratic elections.""  => http://vvv-ig.livejournal.com/690116.html  That's what we have to say, the people of the European Union. Perhaps for your cultures and nations human blood, pain and death mean nothing. But it‚Äôs not the case for the Russians. Helpless old men and women are burned alive on the Ukraine only for that they are Russian!  We won‚Äôt tolerate this. Tolerating this kind of things is unthinkable. This is too much. We will not understand our own government if it shows a white feather in such a moment.  When fascist torches are blazing, lighting is very changing. There are only shades of Light and Darkness. The visibility is poor and it‚Äôs so easy to get things wrong.  Now there‚Äôs only one thing can stop the inevitable. And thank God, this is feasible.  Tribunal over the fascism returning to Europe. The real international Nuremberg Tribunal.  There is enough evidence collected. There are address of the specific killers. There are information on their paymasters. The case can be unriddled. To force the junta to answer for their cannibals. To make America and European officials answer for their junta.  The alternatives to Tribunal are spine-chilling.  Either we achieve Justice or Russia will have to bring troops into Ukraine. This will bring all the charm of ""Russian Vietnam"" by Brzezinski. But we, the Russian people, will go for it for the sake of Justice. To live peacefully, leaving such things unpunished, is unthinkable.  What does it mean to you, the people of Europe?  Historical experience shows that the war of such scale and type can not be kept within the boundaries of the countries involved. It is spreading.  Last time when the ""united Europe"" in the face of the Nazi invaders attacked our country, Russian people composed a song of Victory. This song is about Victory bought for incredible, exorbitant price.  There are words in this song: ¬´The planet is burning and spinning. There‚Äôs a smoke over our Motherland. That means we only need a Victory. One Victory for all ‚Äî we pay the price¬ª.  We will pay the price. If war is inevitable, there will be war. Do we want to fight? No, we do not! Russian people know the value of their victories way too well. We don‚Äôt want to pay this price over and over again. And we don‚Äôt understand why do you need this, the people of free Europe?  That's why we have to solve the matter peacefully.  That‚Äôs why we, the people of Russia, on holy Victory Day - May 9, claim to be heard.  People of Europe! Demand from your Governments to refuse from the American scenario in Ukraine! Require the Tribunal for Nazi murderers in Odessa! Demand the termination of slaughter in the midst of modern Europe from junta!  Without EU flag behind them, the Nazis in Kiev will not be able to retain power. Hundreds and thousands of lives will not be burned in fires.  The world must know the truth about Odessa and Ukraine.  About the fact that politicians of the West while trying to justify their own crisis, set the new fascism at the Russian people. That we can no longer stand apart from such an atrocity happening to the people made of flesh and blood. That this can lead to war. That this war will not just be limited to Ukraine. That things developing by this scenario could turn out to be the biggest meat grinder in whole history. And only a few will survive after that.  People of the West! By stopping the conveyor of lies and disrupting American special operation we can stop the Apocalypse. The Apocalypse in which both you and us have already been appointed to be victims.  You, who is reading these lines - only you can save the mankind!  Share this information if you get it right.",0,0,emindorify,3sHMCRaS3ao,0.04488662889398183,2014-05-10 14:46:59,True,True

Where did the apes get the horses? ¬†They weren't just lying around in the woods so obviously they had to find them somewhere. ¬†Also, how did they learn how to ride them? ¬†None of them know how and it's clear humans didn't teach them.  2. Why are so many humans dead from the virus? ¬†The only way we see it get transmitted in the first movie is when one guy gets sprayed in the face and the other guy gets sneezed on in the face. ¬†Seems like it gets spread similar to the flu. Do you guys remember that one time when one airplane pilot got the flu and then everybody in the world got the flu?  3. How did apes from the zoo get so smart? ¬†Caesar only infected the 50 or so at the Ape Facility. ¬†The ones at the zoo just kind of become smart without explanation. ¬†Also, how are any of the other apes in the world getting smart? ¬†Is some infected person going around sneezing in their faces? ¬†  4. Why are there so many apes here? ¬†There were only 50 or so from the facility and then some more at the zoo. ¬†Where did the other ones come from? ¬†And how did they get infected? ¬†Furthermore, how did they contact each other? ¬†Even if the other ones got smart somehow they wouldn't be able to communicate over long distance because Caesar is the only one who can write and the only one who can understand any human language.  5. Back to the number of apes. ¬†There are maybe 700,000 on the planet right now. ¬†If every single one gets infected somehow, and by some miracle they all band together despite not being able to communicate with one another, the virus would have to wipe out something like 99.9% of all humans before the apes were only out numbered 10 to 1. ¬†Given the fact that the apes have no knowledge of warfare or war tactics and no knowledge of science and technology I'd say the odds are pretty much zero that they would have any chance of winning a war with humans.  6. ¬†How did they manage to make a Planet of the Apes film that has more plot holes then the Marky Mark version?",1,2,T-Bag and the Taint Painters,3sHMCRaS3ao,0.14584942084942085,2014-05-11 20:03:45,True,True

2014-05-11T21:31:00,"""Some of the worst things imaginable have been made with the best intentions."" - Alan Grant, Jurassic Park III.  The scientist played by James Franco made the ALZ-113 virus as a sort of cure for Alzheimer's Disease, mainly for his old father. The ALZ-112 virus was being tested on Primates, which resulted in Caesar's sentience. And because of the abuse he and his fellow apes suffered in that shelter was the cause of their revolution so they can be free and make a home of their own to live in peace. And now the humans that are lead by Gary Oldman's character think the apes are the cause of the new epidemic, not the virus itself.  ""I just want people to wake up.

2014-07-12T15:56:22,"LETS READ THE MOVIE....... Starting in 2018, the wake of the ALZ-113 virus causes the collapse of human civilization. Ten years later, Caesar leads and governs a new generation of apes in a community located in the Muir Woods. While walking through the forest, Caesar's son Blue Eyes and Ash, the son of another chimpanzee, encounter a human. The human, Carver, panics and shoots Ash, wounding him. Carver calls for the rest of his small party of armed survivors, led by a man named Malcolm, while Blue Eyes calls for the other apes. Caesar orders the humans to leave. The remaining humans in San Francisco, genetically immune to the virus, are living in a guarded tower within the ruined city. Prompted by Koba, a scarred bonobo who holds a grudge against humans for his mistreatment, Caesar brings the apes to the city where he orders the humans to never enter ape territory again.  Malcolm convinces his fellow leader Dreyfus to give him three days to reconcile with the apes to gain access to a hydroelectric dam in their territory, which could provide long-term power to the city. Dreyfus, distrustful of the apes, arms survivors using an abandoned armory. Caesar allows Malcolm to work on the dam's generator, provided they surrender their guns. As Malcolm, his partner Ellie, and son Alexander work, they bond with the apes. Meanwhile, Koba discovers the armory and confronts Caesar, questioning his allegiance. In response, Caesar heavily beats Koba, but refuses to kill him and forgives him. Koba returns to the armory and, after murdering two human guards, steals an assault rifle. He then kills Carver, stealing his lighter.  The dam is eventually repaired, restoring power to the city. During the celebration, Koba, unnoticed, lights the apes' home on fire. Caesar notices Koba right before Koba shoots him in the arm, unseen by anyone else. In the panic of the shooting and the fire, Koba claims that Malcolm's group is responsible and orders the apes to war against the humans. Malcolm's group hides as Koba leads the apes to San Francisco. They plunder the armory and charge the tower‚Äôs gates. Despite heavy casualties, the apes overrun the tower and imprison all the humans as Dreyfus flees underground. When Ash refuses Koba‚Äôs orders to kill unarmed humans, citing Caesar's teachings, Koba kills Ash and jails all apes loyal to Caesar.  Malcolm's group find Caesar barely alive and transport him to his former home in San Francisco. Caesar reveals to Malcolm that Koba shot him, realizing his notion that all apes were better than humans was naive. As he enters the city to find medical supplies so Ellie can operate on Caesar, Malcom encounters Blue Eyes and reunites the two. Blue Eyes then frees the caged humans, as well as the apes loyal to Caesar. The freed apes join Caesar and confront Koba at the summit of the tower. Traveling with the apes, Malcolm locates Dreyfus, who informs Malcolm that his men have made radio contact with more survivors on their way to help fight the apes. While Caesar and Koba battle, Malcolm tries to prevent Dreyfus from detonating C-4 explosives underneath the tower. Dreyfus eventually detonates them; the resulting explosion kills Dreyfus and collapses part of the tower. Caesar overpowers Koba and, while lifting Koba from a ledge, refuses to save him and lets him fall to his death.  Malcolm informs Caesar of the impending arrival of human reinforcements. Caesar tells Malcolm the humans will never forgive the apes for the war they started and tells him to leave with his family for safety. As Malcolm slips away into the shadows, Caesar stands before a kneeling mass of apes, ready to lead them into war.",0,0,Freddy Ripper,3sHMCRaS3ao,0.05205627705627705,2014-07-12 15:56:22,False,True

I do recommend watching the 1st film first to get to know some of the characters first but it's not really necessary. I thought the movie would lose some flavor without James Franco but he is not necessary at all in the second film. I really do recommend people to go watch this movie if you haven't done so. It has a overall good story plot because I was never bored throughout the movie and wanted to pay attention to what was happening.

Obviously these are not set in the same time period, however I thought it was implied in the 2001 remake that the apes originated after that spaceship crashed and an ape 'Semos' led the revolt against the humans. After seeing this film today and witnessing the ending that heavily hinted at a sequel to make a trilogy, I'm genuinely confused as to whether it leads to the inevitable dominance of apes like in the original film or a slightly different scenario plays out.",0,0,mjakes20,3sHMCRaS3ao,0.024999999999999994,2014-07-28 22:31:01,False,True
