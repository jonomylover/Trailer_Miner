2018-09-24T08:26:02,"It looks fine and all but I still find it hard to get used to the fact, that this is a prequel. I mean the looks on the transformers are spot on, rocking the G1 designs, but in the Bay universe they are represented like moving and sliding pieces of garbage. Look at Shockwave for example. In this trailer he has the original Cybertronian look, but in the meantime in DotM he still has his so called alien look originated from his home planet. It feels a bit disconnected. It would have been good for this movie being a reboot. I hope we will see more of Cybertron, than we saw in this trailer. I don't want to get tricked by seeing it in the trailer and assume, that there will be more in the actual movie, whereas in reality the time it will be shown will be relatively short. We will see.

But all of the Transformers (with the exception of Bumblebee) have designs ripped straight from G1. I don't think that's a problem, but they look completely different to what they look like in Bay's movies. Like, I don't understand how Soundwave and Shockwave went from how they look here to how they look in the Bay films. Soundwave in particular doesn't look even remotely similar to his Bay design.

This could easily be the best-reviewed transformer film (like more than 9/10) and also earn tons of money but in all this excitement lets not start bashing Michel Bay. I thought the first transformer in 2007 was a solid 8/10 for me. That movie will be one of my happy memories of my life. The ‚ÄùArrival to earth‚Äù tune and other memorable music from Steve Jablonsky plus the   A + CGI was the highlight of that film. The first three transformers from Michel Bay combined together were a good solid summer blockbuster trilogy. But the major problem stars from Transformers 4 to 5. The Transformer movies from Michel Bay were according to me a pioneer in great       A + CGI especially the first 3 movies.,2,1,Chandrasekara Saraswathi,lcwmDAYt22k,0.34805555555555556,2018-09-24 08:54:27,True,True

I am sorry, but Bayformers were atleast more fitting or could be taken a bit more serious in that ""live action"" layer.. I'd prefer the combination of designs that Bumblebee himself has achieved, he looks like a younger version of BayBee. And is pretty much instantly recognizible, but come on..  This is a movie, with a budget to do something pretty fresh and inovating to TF formula, but they just remake G1 TF movie, with cartoonish looks that couldn't work with the vision of our world. If they really wanted to go for G1 characters, they should have made it completly animated. Because it looks a bit silly to imagine Shockwave, Soundwave and all of those guys on Cybertron, in a cinematic that looks like from games, instead like a proper photorealistic movie style Bay has achieved, I mean, okay, Cybertron, but imagine those guys in front of humans. It just looks silly. I rather prefer a messy design, that looks like something that COULD actually stand right next to you and transform itself into a real car with all components inside, rather than a walking children tape recorder 15 meters tall..

2018-09-24T14:54:05,"Though analyzing [https://youtu.be/HY8DH3eReas] would be a worthy inclusion, let us focus on Paramount Pictures Corporation (PPC)¬¥s ""new official trailer"" for #BumblebeeMovie: utmost all, what a pleasing intro. to this Motion Pic., as many a one will likely identify themeselves w/ Hailee Steinfeld¬¥s Charlie Watson obtaining her 1st 4-Wheeler - one must ask, who, why, or what motivated the Old Man at 0:16(sec) to offhandedly provide Charlie w/ the VW Beetle; did he know what he was offering Charlie? What a Birthday.       And what a spectacular event to see arm-lookalike parts falling-off your 1st Car, artistically fitted w/ a face-lookalike underneath. Guess the Old Man had some idea of what he gave Charlie, as to be so grateful when saying ""Happy Birthday"". Now, that's some straightforward assumption-making: ""What are you?""; ""...no idea where he came from?""; ""Wooohooo!"" - mindbreaking carelessness, but hey, gotta provide Bee w/ cover.       At 0:49(sec), is that Hoover Dam? Indeed, where Sector 7 is located. Ponder on the likely action sequence. At 1:00(min:sec), a magnificent intro. to both Angela Bassett¬¥s (voiced) Deception Shatter (Triple-Changer: red Phymouth Satellite; red-detailed Harrier Jet) & Justin Theroux¬¥s (voiced) Deception Dropkick (Triple-Changer: blue AMC Javelin; blue-detailed Helicopter), a truly slick demonstration of their capabilities running frontwardly towards Agent Burns¬¥ Sector 7 Squad.       Bassett¬¥s (voiced) Deception Shatter seemingly has a pair of eyeglasses, mind my sight, but indeed alludes slickly-well to the Cybertronian ""War raging on [their] planet"", represented throughout both 'Transformers: War for Cybertron' & 'Transformers: Fall of Cybertron', [https://youtu.be/QFZrL0x63c8] & [https://youtu.be/C3E358n7pcI]/[https://youtu.be/eyW5KMMDjZw] respectively. ""If [Bumblebee] isn¬¥t found, that War may find its way here"".        --- NOTE: Those retro holograms pair nicely w/ the likely context of this Motion Picture. For anyone out there reading these lines, were you to like to understand what you¬¥re seeing, walk yourself through both Movie Cutscenes of 'Transformers: War for Cybertron' & 'Transformers: Fall of Cybertron' - if Bee¬¥s Movie takes from those two, it will be the correct path. G1 style ---  One may also notice the Escape Pod in which, arguable, Bumblebee was shipped to Earth: ¬¥tis most different from Bay¬¥s take, though quite large for it to be Bee himself - rather, ¬¥tis likely a single-seat ship - its crashing onto a red Phymouth Satellite-lookalike makes me wonder whether it actually is Deception Shatter. Simple message delivered by 1:12(min:sec), indeed, and what a magnificent correction of Cybertron¬¥s appearance, as a Planet, at 1:10(min:sec) - NOW, THAT¬¥S CYBERTRON, not necessarily a polished spherical Honeycomb - at 1:20(min:sec), ""Yes, you.""  Breathe.  At exactly 1:27(min:sec), i.e. [https://youtu.be/lcwmDAYt22k?t=87] (copied Vid.

Yes, Starscream, look closely at exactly [https://youtu.be/lcwmDAYt22k?t=88] (copied Vid. URL at exact time); THAT IS Starscream, and not Blitzwing. That is, when expressed at THIS Vid.

G1 style Shockwave and Starscream confirmed, what detail, reminiscent of G1; what a posture, ready to Raid Hell onto various hopeless Autobots; what an opportunistic Starscream, plunging into killing throughout what may be the Autobot¬¥s last stand - bear in mind, the Cybertronian ""War raging on [their] planet"" represented is likely to be the finalizing blow to their Planet, post-Core shutdown, and prior to the Ark¬¥s Launch. Who are the other 3 Decepticons (Chrome-Red; Matte-Green; Matte-Purple)?

I'm so excited to see what they've got up their sleeve. Finally, we might have a story that is worthy of being just as loved as the War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron video games. I get the same kind of vibe with the Cybertron scenes here as I did while playing those games.   All in all, really REALLY excited for this movie. I'll have to see this one Day 1.

Good wordplay. Gonna reeeeeeally hate those two... 3) Apparently Bee's melee weapon of choice is a serrated sheet rock knife. Neat. 4) I love the design of the Cybertronian jets-- it plays on how they looked in the first G1 episode. Good throwback. 5) G1 designs of the Cybertronian legends. These look so good...!! 6) A MUCH better Cybertron than how it looked in the Bay movies. Seriously... honeycombing is a bad idea. 7) Bee partially transforming to keep Charlie safe in his cab as he maneuvers out of the situation 8) The original transformation sound effects.  9) Bee being too gosh darn cute. Like seriously, gently brushing the sand out of Charlie's hair-- which, to put into perspective, is  giant metal hand the size of her *torso* that is gentle and tactile enough to not cause her harm. Also, the cute wave in the garage. Stahp, Bee. You too kyoot. 10) The poor guy's been forcefully attached to cables by humans enough times, guys, c'mon, leave him alone.

Now, why is it unique....First of all I get the ""nostalgic vibe"" of having the opportunity to see the real and original optimus and the other decepticons in their early and true forms. We get a good observation of cyberton. Moreover, just watching this trailer assures us that thier will be ups and downs with clear and proper climax moments unlike Bay's (yeah i know next goes baam baaam baam) bs. Previous films were good, but tbh yall have to agree that this movie has the qualities to change our mindset regarding the franchise.   Whats also good about this movie is that we get to see many transformers (which was also in the previous movies), but this time their is a straight objective of this movie and a clear goal for a main character transformer. No hassle no new york china bs.   The only thing i hope to see (might not happen) are the dino-bots.

If you are going to make better films of the franchise from now on, please move this movie away from the others. As a small restart, bringing with it a new team of people, directors who give their own vision of Transformers and not repeat the formulas. Travis Knight is a capable director, the fact of having directed stop-motion movies gives him an unparalleled visual capacity if we compare him with Bay or other directors. This Bumblebee is different, it is not the same as the other 5 previous films, it has a personality that he should not lose, because if he lose it, stop being that character with whom it is easy to smile in less than 3 minutes of trailer. Have this movie as a small reboot, with Peter Cullen back, but with everyone else involved in the previous ones out of the map, because in 11 years they were not able to do something this big, and a small restart is at the same time a big reboot. Do not ruin it by having the opportunity. Thanks Travis and everyone involved who thought to go beyond those who only went to the same place in 11 years.

There where some comments in the bonus disc of the first movie from both the design team and Shia LaBeouf to the effect of ""only 10 people on the internet care about what they looked like"". I appreciate the idea of making Soundwave a tape player is weird and there was a need for change, but the visual design in this trailer shows they are now striking a balance between being faithful to the iconic designs I grew up with and a modern look. When I first seen the original movies I got excited at the prospect of a ""real action"" Transformers movie but it turned out to be an expensive advertising campaign.

2018-09-25T10:35:13,"All right here we go, I hate being this guy, but I have a small issue with this trailer, and it is the fact that it seems like a trailer for two separate movies. Let me explain what I mean, it is the differing aesthetics within the trailer. The transformers on earth have the Bay-verse live action aesthetics, where as the ones on Cybertron have a G1/WFC design and they clash in my opinion.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the G1 fan service (and that is all it is) I really do, and I am looking forward to seeing more of ‚Äúthis‚Äù Cybertron‚Äù on the big screen, which is way better than anything Bay gave us (meaning Cybertron wise), but like I said except for that message from Optimus, it looks like two separate movies are being advertised in the trailer. I don‚Äôt know how many of you saw Digimon:The Movie from the year 2000, well in the US version what they did was combined three separate movies (that is how they were released in Japan ), so that the running time would be longer , but the three movies all had different art styles, designs and narrative. So they attempted to tie (not a pun) all of them together, while editing parts out, making changes, which just lead to a very confusion movie‚Ä¶..unless you loved Digimon enough and the fact that it was on the big screen forgave all of that, you might of left the theater saying‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWTF‚Äù.  Of course another example I could use, which might be a better one come to think of it is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.ROBOTECH‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and that is what this trailer is making me think what the Bumblebee Movie will be like‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it will be like watching ROBOTECH.  If Bumblebee, Dropkick, Shatter and Blitzwing had more of that G1 design then I would feel different, but they don‚Äôt. It almost feels like they ‚Äúadded‚Äù all this Cybertron stuff after the initial movie was done filming and edited.  Like I don‚Äôt know if it is a spoiler, but Hasbro has made ‚Äúnew‚Äù figures for the Bumblebee movie-line of Bumblebee as the Classic Camaro he was at the beginning of the 2007 movie, and a lot of people have said that at the end of this film he will be scanning that car‚Ä¶..hence leading into that adventure.  I am just hoping this is not a way to make ‚ÄúG1ers‚Äù happy or satisfied, while throwing away canon, design, and consistency of the movie itself.  It reminds me of that game from a few years ago ‚ÄúRise of the Dark Spark‚Äù, where the WFC universe crossed over with the live action universe, and at times the differing designs got jarring and that was for just a game.  Also‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if this is a prequel, then they all should look like their protoforms as seen in the 2007 movie‚Ä¶..but you know what let us kick Mister OCD out the door‚Ä¶..but let us get Mister Nitpicker the realist in here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Why do they have EARTH Vehicle/and or Devices parts on their Cybertronian bodies?  Fine the first G1 episode did that (among others), but come on, no excuse will make this acceptable.  Again I love the scene with Cybertron, it just does not look like it fits into the rest of the movie, but that does not mean I am not going to love this G1 fan service, because I definitely will‚Ä¶..but at what cost. #BUMBLEBEEMOVIE #TRANSFORMERS",2,0,Michael Alex Kawa,lcwmDAYt22k,0.13087829828901254,2018-09-25 10:35:13,True,True

While I will admit, I am not too crazy on the boxy, G1 bot modes on Cybertron, I don't mind XD Sure, I do prefer the designs from the prequel comics a bit more, in-terms of them looking more 'alien', 'realistic' and 'advanced robotic organisms from outer-space' look; they weren't the best, but a mixture if those with these would have been great. These just look too 'cartoony' and video-gamey. They remind me of WFC and FOC. But it's the fact that they looks only like robots; not something 'out of this world', more like toys, HUMAN toys. *shrugs*  But meh... I honestly don't mind, not what I'd prefer but still like them. It's just different and new, just gotta get used to them is all. Though they do look a bit of place IMO, but nothing will ever meet up 100% to what anyone wants or expects :P You get whatcha get.

2018-09-25T13:18:18,"The G1 designs are absolutely fantastic. But to be fair, some of the transformers here do have influences from the Bayformer franchise such as Bumblebee and Thundercracker. Which is pretty cool since that means to an extent, Bay and Spielberg did set a certain standard to how Transformers should look and feel in live action. The huge difference was that he tried to make it more realistic and more adult orientated, which is probably why most transformers in that franchise was redesigned to a ridiculous degree in which many don‚Äôt even resemble their original G1 look.  Imho it really started to go downhill from T4 as the transformers were made to look less robotic and more humanoid which completely defeats the purpose of setting them apart as *alien robots* in the first place. I guess the reason for that drastic change was to sell new toys smh.  EDIT: Keep in mind, I‚Äôm only referring to the *design* of the transformers from the films. The second movie was garbage but it still used the same aesthetic from the first one. DOTM used it too but AOE and TLN literally looked like as if they were pieces of wet tissue twisted together in contrast to the more complete robotic look from the first three films.",164,21,N,lcwmDAYt22k,0.16468554593554594,2018-09-25 13:18:18,True,True

2018-09-25T20:34:55,"This looks pathetic. How many times must the developers fail before they learn copy/pasting an old look just doesn't work. People in the comments are blinded by nostalgia. You're not going to get your childhood back. It may have a greater resemblance to the G1 show than the Michael Bay movies, but that is simply cosmetic. The Transformers was cool because you had a giant roster of Autobots and Decepticons fighting each other. Having just one Transformer isn't going to be fun. Bumblebee was never even that important of a character anyway before the Bay films. He was pretty small and weak.  The reason I think the Michael Bay films are good Transformers films in spite of whatever weak writing may be there is because they capture the feel of the G1 show, without the look. The special effects are phenomenal, and in a Transformers film that really is most of what counts. The rest of the appeal comes from the way the Transformers talk. They use common Earth expressions but replace our words with words used for automobiles or machinery. All you need is good animation, good action, and good dialogue. The Bay films deliver on that admirably.  This trailer looks like a weird attempt at merging the G1 animation style, which was excellent in its day and original medium, with the CGI of the Bay films, and it just doesn't look very impressive on the big screen.",0,0,Mr. JustAGuyWithALightsaber,lcwmDAYt22k,0.18690476190476188,2018-09-25 20:34:55,True,True

And before anyone disproves my theory, hear me out on all of the similarities . 1. Giant robot lands on Earth and is unfamiliar with the place  2. There is a character that teaches said robot the ways of the humans  3. There is some sort of government official that is trying to get rid of it.  It is also implied in The Iron Giant Signature Edition that the robots were in a war that ended up in the destruction of a planet, and in this movie, there is a war happening between Transformers that could end up destroying the planet they came from.

When you put those stupid big ""epic"" drum buildup beats without any music or other audio to accompany it, it just sounds incredibly stupid, and that's exactly what happened in this trailer. Might I also say the most of the dialogue feels bad/ out of place/ given with the wrong delivery.  The little music that is in the trailer also sounds incredibly stupid and basic. Although, I'm very impressed by the CGI, and you can clearly tell Michael Bay isn't directing this, but after seeing this trailer, my expectations have dropped all the way back down from the high hopes I had after watching the teaser.

Let me start over: Another girl meets alien/robot/dinosaur story where the government wants to capture and destroy it but there‚Äôs a bigger story at play where the girl shows government that alien/robot/dinosaur is a good guy and by the end we‚Äôre off to a sequel. Still interested? Okay: First  5 minutes will tease a problem (possibly how robot/alien/thing arrived or the war that happened years before) but we‚Äôll get to later. Next 10 minutes hopefully we can empathize but probably just feel sorry for the girl as she meets car for first time at 15 minute mark. Then explore their relationship trying to discover what that thing is... possibly telling a friend at school or the friend stumbles upon them in the barn. Maybe she drives him to school and he can‚Äôt seem to be a car anymore; this entails keeping him a secret which will be quite funny (I hope!). Meanwhile government will already know or find out about it so at the 30 minute point, they‚Äôll start getting closer, maybe entering the town. But wait, who is this other bad guy? Well maybe robot car thing will get the info dump on why he‚Äôs here and will seek out the bad guy stopping them from getting something that will do something bad to people (death to earth for example) and then car will need to save girl cause girl be getting in harms way and shiiit. And then girl is trying to convince pappa government that he‚Äôs a good guy while they are shooting him instead of the bad guys. He‚Äôll get captured or she will by either bad guys or government and eventually we‚Äôll get either of them back with the help of some good guys. They‚Äôll have a loss but it‚Äôll be a fake loss and then eventually girl helps them win (hopefully now having convinced government). Added bonus if car dinosaur thing had made an irresponsible choice by avoiding responsibilities or getting lost or losing his memory and thereby having to regain what was lost.

2018-09-27T18:28:13,I watched the new bumblebee trailer. I just have one issue. The g1 designs in the scenes from cybertron. They are too much like the g1 version. To much like they came out of the war for cybertron video game. It‚Äôs not realistic. The one good thing I liked the most about when bay was in charge was the designs. They were still true to the characters to where u knew who they were. But they were in a far more realistic light and not so blocky. They were a perfect representation of an alien tech based humanoid life form. The one thing that threw me off the most was shockwave and soundwave. To much like g1.  This is what I was afraid of when they started to do things write. Over correcting. Like now we get a good story with otherwise less awesome designs. I‚Äôm not bashing fans of the old movie from the 80s. Heck the first tf series I ever completed watching growing up was armada and that style was a lot like the old one in terms of blockiness. But u can‚Äôt go that literal with a realistic interpretation. They need to be more like if a living creature with an fully functional body structure was made of metal. Plus the armor and vehicle modes would hardly at all resemble human vehicles if they haven‚Äôt come here yet. They would be rather alien like they were shown in previous films.,0,3,Nathan Corley,lcwmDAYt22k,0.20537878787878786,2018-09-27 18:28:13,True,True

Not Directed by Michael Bay!!! 3. NOT DIRECTED BY MICHAEL BAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 4. G1 DESIGNS!!! 5. Female lead (and not just for eye candy) 6. Comedy looks actually funny (and not offensive) 7. Ignoring The Last Knight (We don't appear to see Bumblebee kill Nazis) 8. Director Previously made Kubo and the Two Strings (Which I haven't seen but I heard is really good) 9. The Human lead doesn't look stupid 10. Isn't mind numbingly long (Like age of Extinction) 11. Lower budget (Which could mean more restraint)  Cons 1. Another Transformers movie 2. Michael Bay is still producing 3. Human is still main character in a transformers movie 4. Written by the writer of Shut In (2016) and Unforgettable (2017)  Again I hope this movie's good and I'm going to see it in theaters if it is.

Nobody was ever nice to each other. And that wasn't done to make the audience think critically and reflect on their values. Bumblebee actually looks like characters are going to be expressing positive sentiments towards one another.  I have not seen either of Christina Hodson's other films, but from the trailer Bumblebee seems to have more humanity than all the Bay films put together.  Travis Knight has been the lead animator on some really wonderful animated films, and directed / animated Kubo.  These are family movies which I believe usually feature a moral, and all appear to have solid storytelling.  I have faith that Christina and Travis can make a better, more compassionate story than the lingerie / milk commercial guy did.  Transformers should have been for kids. The toys are meant for kids. Why did they let it become a homophobic, misogynistic (it also denigrates men too, not just women), commercial mess?  Do they want 8 year olds to go to the store and buy an Optimus figure, then go get some Bud light, and then join the army? I would not let a child watch the other transformers movies.

Wen came first live-action Transformers movie from 2007. when Be calls Autobot to come down to earth. We see protoform Autobots to a precise scene when Optimus first became transformers. Science is very short, but we see the exact moment when he scans track and became transformers. Next moment he meets Sam Witwicky and Mecaila. My question is:  How in the movie, this movie, Optimus have the original form of the truck when fighting with other Decepticon on Cybertron, But there also have shape jet aircraft. That means they been on earth and change shape from protoform to cars and aeroplanes and then back to the planet to fight in the war. That's don't have a sense.

2018-12-19T02:46:42,"B127 is real. ""Let him who has wisdom calculate the beast for the number is 666."" Rev 13:18. Frederick Abberline who Johnny Depp played in the movie ""From Hell"" enlisted with the London police on January 5, 1863. Exactly 106 years later Led Zeppelin and the Grateful Dead were performing in San Francisco the night the Antichrist was born January 5, 1969. On Marilyn Manson's 13th birthday 18,000 landslides occurred in San Fran that killed 33 and it also coincided with the 49th anniversary of the start of the Golden Gate Bridge. On Manson's 1st birthday over 15,000 people died from an Earthquake that struck Vietnam  on January 5, 1970. On January 5, 2018 Manson turned 49 and the Kadovar volcano erupted for the first time in recorded history. Enoch talked of the end of days and lived on Earth for 365 years. Kadovar is 365 meters tall. Amelia Earhart disappeared here and was declared dead on January 5, 1939.¬† Philadelphia is one of the 7 churches of Revelation. The Eagles won there first Superbowl in 2018. Philly to Canton Ohio is 333 miles as the crow flies. Canton is where Manson was born and is the birthplace of the NFL and is where the football Hall of Fame is located. Canton to Chicago is 333 miles as the crow flies. This line adds up to 666 the number of the beast. Chicago is where Anton Lavey published the satanic Bible the same year Manson was born. They became friends after meeting at the ""Black house"" in San Fran where Anton founded the church of Satan. The current Pope chose to be named after the same Saint San Fran is named after.¬† Alcatraz is named the Rock which stands for Peter the Rock Jesus's best friend. When the Birdman of Alcatraz died he was buried in Metropolis Illinois, Superman's hometown. The steel used to build the Golden Gate came from Bethlehem PA named after Jesus's hometown. Metropolis is 333 miles as the crow flies from Ft. Wayne my hometown.¬† In the 1962 movie ""the Birdman of Alcatraz"" the first bird he saves is a sparrow he names Jack. In Pirates of the Caribbean Johny Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp is best friends with Marilyn Manson who In 1996 said ""Hopefully I will be remembered for the one who brought an end to Christianity."" That same year he released ""Antichrist Superstar."" I was born on January 27, 1980 and the Birdman January 28, 1890. I was born on a Sunday 6 minutes before midnight. On January 28, 1986 the space shuttle Challenger exploded killing all 7 on board including a school teacher named Christa. Every ten years since the accident people who who have had a significant impact on the world have died and they are all connected by a bird, a plane, and Superman. On the first 10 year anniversary Jerry Siegal the creator of Superman died on January 28, 1996. This happened on the Birdmans 106th Birthday, a man who was buried in Metropolis 33 years earlier.10 years later Rabbi Yitskah Kaduri died at age 106 on January 28, 2006. Rabbi Kaduri had the largest funeral in Israel's history and is known for writing a letter which was opened a year after his death which stated Jesus is the true Messiah. Ten years later Signe Toly and Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane from San Francisco died on January 28, 2016. On the 5 year anniversary of the death of the Rabbi an Angel appeared over the Dome of Rock on January 28, 2011. George Reeves the only Superman to be shot and killed was born on January 5. Manson's birthday also coincides with National bird day. In Revelation it talks about how birds will devour the antichrist. In 2015 Manson released the song ""Bird of hell awaiting"", which talks about the death of the Phoenix a mythical bird which is associated with Jesus because of it's a ability to resurrect itself. The¬† San Francisco flag is of the Phoenix. Hitchcock's movie ""The Birds"" was filmed in SF and was released in 1962 the same year the movie ""the birdman of Alcatraz""was released and is also the same year the Birdman died. Sir Henry Stanley is the person who inspired the book¬† ""Heart of Darkness."" That book then became the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick's movie ""Apocalypse Now."" Henry Stanley was born on January 28, 1841, exactly 49 years before the Birdman. The Birdman was originally sent to Alcatraz for stabbing a guard through the heart. In 1996 I became paralyzed the first time I heard the song ""Beautiful People."" In 2001 a demons voice guided me to Mansons autobiography ""The Long Hard Road out Of Hell."" In 2003 Carmelo Anthony led the Orangemen to their first NCAA title in 2003 over Kansas. The next morning after that game I walked the yellow brick road in real life after almost drowning where the St. Joseph and St. Marys rivers meet in Ft. Wayne to form the Miami river. The first person I met at St. Joe was a man named OZ. OZ had a branding on his forearm that had the ""Echo"" logo on it. The Rhinoceros logo was the same size and shape of the logo on the side of the reddish orange Echo shoes I was given earlier that day by my friend Scot after I got out of the river barefoot. ""the Dark side of the Rainbow"" is a story about how Pink Floyds Darkside of the moon syncs up with the Wizard of Oz. This story originated with a 1995 Journal Gazette article in Ft Wayne the same city I walked the yellow brick road in 8 years later. 2003 was also the same year I got arrested for climbing the Anthony Wayne building on St. Pat's. It was an Orange year in 2003. The Ft. Wayne Komets, the Buccaneers,¬† and the Orangemen all won that year. My stepdad Joseph owned a motorcycle shop which was orange as well as all of his drag bikes. The Wizard of OZ is a story about the defeat of the antichrist. The water making the Witch melt is a sign of baptism. All of the teams in Fort Wayne are named after the Wizard of OZ. The Tin Caps are the baseball team which would be The Tin Woodsman. Before they were the Tin caps they were the Wizards. Johnny Appleseed is the original Tin woodsman who is buried in Ft. Wayne. The Komet hockey team used to be the Choppers. Nick Chopper is the Tin Man's name in the book the wizard of Oz.The Ft. Wayne Mad Ants would be the ""Aunty M's."" In ""Return to Oz"" Dorothy is sent to the psyche ward. The Doctor tries to give her a shock treatment then lighting knocks the power out. Dorothy escapes out of a window and gets swept away by a river which takes her back to OZ. In 2003 I got swept away by a river where I ended up meeting OZ. The Doctor then tried to give me a shock treatment. I tried to escape out of a window as well. I haven't aged a day since the river incident in 2003 when I was 23. My mothers first tattoo was Peter Pan on her neck yet she still doesn't know who I am. I used to rap as Reaces Peace's and Marshall Mathers rapped as Eminem. Eminem was born in St. Joseph Missouri and I was born at St. Joseph Hospital. I grew up in Ft. Wayne and Eminem grew up in Wayne county both named after Anthony Wayne. We are both left handed and have blue eyes. Eminems middle name is Bruce and he grew up in Wayne county. Batman is Bruce Wayne and Batman was actually named after Mad Anthony Wayne. Peter the Rock is the original Batman. Peter was crucified upside down upon his request. They also decapitated him and sawed him in half for good measure.¬† There was a man on the Kansas team in 2003 whose name is Wayne Anthony the founder of Ft. Wayne's name backwards. Wayne was Kansas's best player but was injured and could not play in that championship game or Kansas might have won. Wayne later won a title in the NBA with Miami and is now a preacher. The son of man is Jesus and the son of man backwards is Man son. Peyton Manning went to play for a horse of a different color, from the Colts to the Broncos. Brock OS(OZ) Weiller Quarterbacked most of there Superbowl winning season. Manning's favorite thing to say at the line of scrimmage was""Omaha."" Omaha is what is written on the side of the Hot Air Balloon at the end of the Wizard of Oz. In Superbowl 48 Peyton was defeated by, ""the Emerald city"", Seattle. In Super Bowl 50 Peyton defeated Superman at the 49ers Cathedral. I was born on January 27, the same as Nick Mason of Pink Floyd. The Dark side of the moon starts with the song ""Breathe"" which has a lyric ""run rabbit run."" Eminem played ""B Rabbit"" in the movie 8 mile which is based on ""Run rabbit run"" written by John Updyke. John died 7 years later on my birthday. Eminem released the song ""the Yellow Brick road"" and Elton John released the album ""leaving the Yellow Brick road."" At the 2001 Grammys they performed the song ""Stan,"" together. Eminem released his autobiography ""the dark side of Eminem"" the chapter ""Stan"" starts on my birthday page 127. Stan Lee created Spiderman and when Dorothy runs away the first person she meets is professor Marvel. Spiderman is from Marvel comics. I became Spiderman in 2003 and also dated Mary Jane who was also born in Canton the same city as Marilyn Manson. Andre the Giant who shares my last name and also climbed cliffs of insanity died on my 13th Birthday 1/27/93. Belfort is the birthplace of the man who sculpted the statue of Liberty. My name Nickolas Giant contains two New York teams. Manson has been working on the movie ""Phantasmagoria"" where he plays an evil Lewis Carrol. Lewis was once accused of being Jack the Ripper. Lewis lived most of his life at a college named after Christ. Carrol who wrote Alice in Wonderland was also born on January 27. Johnny Depp played the Mad Hatter. The founder of Ft. Wayne is Mad Anthony Wayne. Barbara Hershey who played Mary Magdalene in Oliver Stone's last Temptation of Christ was on the set of a movie titled ""Last Summer"" when she felt the Spirit of a Seagull enter her body. She then changed her last name to Seagull. In 2002 Ja Rule played an inmate on Alcatraz alongside Steven Seagull in the movie Half past Dead as the character ""Nickolas.""

2018-12-19T14:39:43,"Overall it was a good film. Well made, excellent CGI and fight scenes. And a nice simplicity to its story.  But.....  It is a part of the current trend of turning boys into girls and girls into boys. I guess it's a different meaning of the word.  Transformers was originally a boys cartoon, full of violence and tribal allegiance. And this movie has all of that. But it's confusing gender roles by having the girl as the mechanic and the boy with the embarrassing range of hair products. While slamming the ""normal kids"", the friends who are masculine males and the feminine females. ie: 95% of the population.  Then they try to sell us on the idea that an 18 year metal loving, mechanic chick is a perfect christian when it comes to dating.  And the final song as the credits role was fluffy bunny stuff.  Come on Hollywood. How about making one for the normal people for a change.  But the action was first rate.

I mean you literally see this same girl get hit by a missile in a dumpster and she just walks out of it like nothing even happened? The army guys that are obsessed with destroying everything they find? The government's weird fetish for dismantling a transformer for scrap parts? These are just some of the many scenes that took me out of the immersion and made me question if anything even makes sense or not.

2018-12-31T23:33:22,"Before time itself, there was a being called 'The One' who represented order and chaos in harmony. 'The One' wanted to explore more of the universe and thus split into two beings, Unicron and Primus. Unicron representing chaos, and Primus representing order. Primus found out that Unircon was destroying (eating) planets and thus made the 'Thirteen Primes' (not going to name them all) to help him destroy unicron. After unicrons defeat, his body drifted into space and eventually formed the earth's core. Primus then became one with the core cypertron where he gives his life to future transformers trough the Alspark in the 'Well Of All Sparks'. A bit of conflict started between 'The Thirteen Primes' and Liege Maximo manipulated Megatronus into killing Solus Prime. Her body unexpectedly melted into the core of cypertron wich formed the 'Well Of All Sparks'. Onyx Prime, Micronus Prime, and the Thirteen Prime Willingly enter the Well Of All Sparks' and sacrifice their lives in order to jump-start its creative processes, with the intent of creating a new race to inhabit  cybertron. Meanwhile, Quintus Prime travels into deep space with an Emberstone to create a race that would ally future cybertronian civlizations and thus creates the Quintessons. The 'Thirteenth Prime' comes out of the 'Well Of All Sparks' reincarnated as Orion Pax who as we know becomes Optimus Prime. Cut a long story short the Quintessons made the transformers their slaves and took over cybertron by creating their own goverment and laws. The transformers then rebel against the Quintessons and force them off the planet. The transformers then lived in peace. Then overtime some transformers believed that chaos was the best way to live, whilst others thought that order was the best way to live(Autobots and Decepticons). Then the great war starts between them. (I congratulate you for reading all of this.üòÇüòÅüòÅüáßüá™",0,0,itsmebob,lcwmDAYt22k,0.26898395721925134,2018-12-31 23:33:22,False,True

None of the bots seemed humanlike as it was in the last Bayformer movies, but they had their own ‚Äúimage‚Äù. In this movie transformers seemed nerfed and pretty childish. For example the dialogue between decepticons was absolutely dumb as it felt as clich√© as it can be. Other than that the action was great, this time you can actually tell who is fighting who.

The back story of Bumblebee was shown.  He was there during the Nazi war. He was an old VW.  Now this version shows him arriving only a few years before the first Transformers movie supposedly begun?  The time line must have crossed wrong somewhere.  I might be wrong... Also it showed Optimus Prime in his animated look, but you can clearly see he is a truck.

However i feel fucking riped off when it comes to quality of the movie itself compared to the previous ones. The CGI outside the focus of Bumblebee was dogshit. The Timeline doesnt match the the history presented in the previous ones either. Now Michael Bay started something epic, in the same line Blizzard produces their Cinematics for their World of Warcraft branch. u expect top notch CGI and quality. Bumblebee did not deliver in that mather.  the story of Charlie and Bee was alright, the story outside of that was non existing. If they combine both aspects of the Previous Movies with a bigger story line, and not cut the budget on CGI quality. this can be a perfect re-start for the  franchise. but it can also end in a fat flop if they continue with this example",0,0,DarkscytheHD,lcwmDAYt22k,0.05128205128205129,2019-01-06 18:03:28,False,True

Anyway, how come he can't talk like he could in the original cartoon? Why did they change his model so much?

One of the first skills you pick up). But more importantly, what she was doing to the transmission/driveshaft that would have affected whether or not the car started? (The answer is nothing because that's not how a '60s car works)  If you don't want to look like fools, and you want her to look good, have the engine on a stand (gutted). Then have her fiddling with cleaning something (like the carb or fuel pump), expertise will be assumed by the work already done not by the work being done. ...Which was obviously nothing since she wasn't even working in the engine bay.  Why was she having so much trouble? Spark issue: coil, plugs, or distributor. Fuel/air: Carb, fuel pump, or regulator. Doesn't crank: starter/battery... possibly ignition (if there is no power to the acc.). Those are basically the only things on an engine of that age. If it sparks and gets fuel but only sputters, then test compression or adjust the carb. There are so few wires, any wiring issue should be easily visible....  Just, why?

The story was well done and the 80's work not just because it's popular again, but because it's the right era for this film. Other than Bumble Bee in robot form, the other Autobots actually look like what they are suppose to. Soundwave also looks like how he should (my favorite decepticon). Christina Hodson wrote this film and she delivers on providing a really good story with allot of fun and emotion mixed in. I'd really love to have this movie on Blu-ray.

2019-01-28T03:41:43,"Finally a Transformers movie made by a true filmmaker and the franchise may finally ignite the series. The issue has always been Michael Bay's style of humour and lack of direction for the characters. Knight on the other hand course corrects and provides a heartfelt connection to the series. The first 10 minutes are some of the most impressive action scenes of the series, relentless. It is a shame that audiences have neglected this, most likely due to the very poor Last Knight storyline. They have a chance to ignore the other movies in the franchise now and it is a good idea, the mythology of the characters was essentially destroyed by a director with little or no care for the franchise. I hope Knight returns in some form and Bay is sidelined for the future, think Snyder for the DC universe. This is a funny and at times heartfelt story, that services the fans and new fans at the same time. Great action and without the dumb jokes that plague the Transformers central series.

Seriously, a friend showed the clip to me & I was literally ready, ON THE SPOT, to jump in the car & fly over to AMC Citywalk so I could catch the next showing.  Luckily they stopped me & told me that THAT was the ONLY EPIC part of the entire movie. The rest was good, they said, sure... but not First 3 Minutes EPIC.  Still waiting for EPIC. No teases. No carrot dangling. No human drama interfering & completely taking over the A & B Plots while the Giant Transforming Robots at War that I WANT to see are shoved into a back seat C Plot or killed off 30 seconds after they're introduced.  I just want Transformers, y'all. Just like those first 2 seasons gave us in the 80's. Fun, thrilling stories about awesome Transforming robots that are forced to interact in & around our world but are not ultimately overshadowed nor hindered by the fact. They do so in secret. Without our knowledge. Hence... the whole Transforming thing. But should a human or two absolutely HAVE to be around, they're the sidekicks, or occasional background noise. NOT the stars.

This movie was clearly written by a self-centered woman whose goals were to pander to the audience with non-stop cliches while depicting an actress that is struggling with nothing more than her own feelings about herself.  I have never seen a ""basic"" main character be depicted as shallow and narrow minded in a movie ever before.  1) She is full of herself the whole movie.  2) She was a depressing drag 90% of the time.  3) Though the movie was called Bumblebee, it was really about a shallow girl who only cared about herself.  4) She ignores everyone around her the whole movie, no humility what-so-ever.  The movie should have been called, Girl Kidnaps Bumblebee.  The movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if they would have left out the cheesy cliches.  The writer made Bubblebee very week and gave him puppy dog eyes for crying out loud.  The CGI was the worst I have ever seen in the last 10 years.

2019-05-18T01:57:53,"Ok, so this movie is supposed to be about BumbleBee first coming to Earth and basically his origin story. In the timeline, BumbleBee comes to Earth in 1974 I think. But in Transformers 5, we are shown that the Transformers have long been on Earth before 1974. BumbleBee helped the allies win in World War 2. Optimus Prime helped George Washington in the American Revolution. The Guardian Knights helped the English beat the enemies. So this basically just messed up the entire timeline because, in the end, we see that BumbleBee transforms into a Camaro using his scanning thingy. That Camaro was the same 1974 Camaro we first see the car BumbleBee appears as in the first 2 (I think its 2) Transformers movies. So obviously this movie was supposed to lead up to the rest of the Transformers movies. That still doesn't add up because like I said earlier, Bumblebee and the transformers have already been at Earth before 1974.  Also! Why in Transformers 1 to 5, would the military attack the Autobots if Bumblebee literally saved Earth all by himself. Also, also!

There wasn't something she actually could expect to do.  My fix is that: * The decepticons _DO_ dramatically kill Bumblebee. They yank out his heart. This will be the unexplained green powercell they are using to power their signal. * Charlie has some basic knowledge of BB's electrical system from wiring in that radio. Her goal with shooting him with those electric guns is to charge his capacitors. Capacitors give him the ability for a few minutes of activity only. She could also hook his power to a truck and drive him to the final battle, but that is a detail. * At the end he has exerted all his power and this is why he sinks to the bottom unmoving. * When she dives into the water, the point is to restore his heart to him.",1,1,peter,lcwmDAYt22k,-0.06325757575757575,2019-11-20 07:56:19,False,False
