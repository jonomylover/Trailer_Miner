Directed by Bend It Like Beckham's Gurinder Chadha, it shares themes with that crowd-pleasing hit: the conflict between tradition and following your dreams, the tension between parents and teens, the power of an all-consuming obsession, and the importance of empathy. Mature content is mostly in the form of strong language (""s--t,"" ""bloody,"" ""wanker,"" ethnic slurs, etc.), kissing/innuendo, and racist bullying and violence. A Pakistani character is pushed down and injured by white nationalists, there's a hate crime at a local mosque, and characters feel threatened because of their race. Characters also argue.
