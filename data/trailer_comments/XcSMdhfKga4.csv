2017-12-21T09:12:33,"I dont understand why are people so outraged.... it was pretty clear from the beginning, that Meryl Streep's role will NOT be so big as it was in the first movie, because the main focus will be on flashbacks. So we would not see Meryl in the second movie so much anyway. And if her character is really dead, it makes perfect sense. If the ""main event"" of the first movie is wedding, it's a great contrast to make a funeral (and wake) the ""main event"" of the second movie. Logic. We can clearly see Meryl in the new trailer at least in two scenes - one pure fantasy scene, in costumes with Dynamos , and the second one with Sophie - and if is she really dead, that would be some very emotional ""final goodbye"" scene, hopefully with some duet). The story of the second movie NEEDS some reason to happen. Characters need some big reason to get back together. Also there has to be a reason tell young Donna's story - and thats Sophie's pregnancy. It makes perfect sense. Tanya and Rosie will tel Sophie, how ""she did it all on her own"" and she will ""become a second Donna"" ... Full freaking circle. So people, please, think before hate , ok ? :). (Btw I am very curious what songs they will use - If Donna is really dead, there needs to be some ""goodbye"" song - ¬†and I cant think of one song that fits - maybe ""Like an angles passing through my room"" - witch is some kind of lullaby but I cannot shake off the feeling that somehow the song is about death.

The first film has always been one of my favourite 'happy movies' - the ones I adore because they're greatly entertaining but also light enough that I can watch them with not too much emotional effort. So I suppose I never imagined the sequel could contain anything so profound as the death of one of the main characters. I'm sure the overall tone of the film will still be quite light and ultimately happy, but still I know I'm going to cry like a baby when Donna dies or is said to have died.

Like donna can't tell by herself 3. They say also that donna WAS really brave. 4. Sophie say that she has never felt so close to her mother before. And she say it like now that she is gone and she is knowing this part of her they are closer.  5. Don't say that maybe sam is with her and that's the reason why sophie thinks she is alone, because sam appears with the other two possibly fathers.  6. And if you see min 1:31 are singing sophie rosie and tania, and then like a flashback of tania rosie and donna singing. So i think she is dead and they are trying to remember de good times.

2018-02-05T20:30:50,"Crikey! From the late 70s into the 80s, the song 'carried' the video. The video was kind of superfluous due to the song being the essential thing. But in the 90s, the song began to be carried by the video as the multi-channel television age began to arrive: the song became relatively less important to the video - and the number of original new melodies soon sank to almost zero into the new millennium. But here, in this latest Mamma Mia movie, the songs have returned to carry the video, the film. It's a bit like an extended pop video. Just as well. Without Abba's songs, albeit sung by the actors, and without the music production, both the script and the characters portrayed would plummet into the realm of mediocrity. What this state of affairs means is that Abba's music deserves better treatment for the stage than these Mamma Mia shenanigans. There is another thing about these two Mamma Mia movies that sticks in my craw: nobody, not one person in it, looks short of money. They all seem well-off. What was great about Abba's foray into the UK music scene in the mid-70s was their great appeal to a great number of people: rich and poor, old and young. They appealed directly to the working classes in Britain as their music had a unique combination of consolation and fun. Abba teased and delighted their audience, too. But this movie has been spun out to appeal to the whims of the well-off and connected smug, I'm afraid. Anybody who remembers the MAGIC of Abba's music, as it was in the late 70s, will not recognise the ... magic, if it exists, in these movies.  In the three-TV-channel Britain of the 70s, when many people could not afford a colour TV, Abba's music was chiefly sweet consolation for many. In fact, millions of people probably only ever heard their music over the daily radio. But as people today, on their smart phones, are in the habit of droning on and on about today's 'bleak times', you'd think that an opportunity to make a meaningful movie or stage musical on an entity that had moved so many forty years ago would not be let go. But it has been let go. I'm afraid. As for fun and humour, there's more humour in Abba's ""Take A Chance On Me"" pop video than there is in the whole of one of these two movies.",0,0,Dustshoe,XcSMdhfKga4,0.19932605273514364,2018-02-05 20:30:50,True,True

2018-07-20T04:24:11,"Well... I just saw Mamma Mia 2 and I'm not quite sure how to put my emotions into words. I won't spoiler, though, so feel free to keep reading even if you haven't seen the movie (I think that no matter what stage of knowledge you're at, we all know that Meryl doesn't have a lot of screen time, so I don't consider that a spoiler!). I didn't know what to expect. Mamma Mia is one of my favourite movies of all times and it holds a very special place in my heart. As we have all seen countless bad or semi-bad (slash repetitive!) sequels, I wasn't sure what to think when I heard they were making a sequel / prequel to the ultimate feel-good musical movie of 2008, especially when I found out Meryl's part wouldn't be very large (that is not a spoiler ;)!). So I drove to the cinema tonight thinking I might hate it, or be disappointed, or like it, but that it would certainly not be as good as the first and NEVER EVER hold the place in my heart that the first one does. But now, I'm not so sure... Of course the film has too little Meryl in it for my liking (and probably most of you, too), but that is not the point. That cannot be the only reason you judge a film (in my opinion anyway). Besides the fact she's hardly in it (and Lily seems to have brown eyes, not Meryl's lovely piercing blue ones; also, not a spoiler!) I cannot find anything wrong with this movie. I'm pretty sure, looking at it from a movie critic's view (which I'm not, so forgive me), it will receive better reviews and probably will be considered by many as the ""better"" film (although everyone may have their own opinion about that). I'll just say - because I don't want to spoil it for the people who haven't seen it yet - it's deeper. Much, much deeper. Mamma Mia was a party. The greatest, most vibrant party I have ever seen, with people leaving movie theaters skipping and singing. This movie covers the day after the party, and the day before, and all the ones inbetween. It's about growing up, friendships, love, heartbreaks, family, relationships and - most importantly - motherhood & the bond between a parent and their child. I don't think anyone who is a parent, or a sister or a daughter, could walk out of this movie without having shed a couple of tears (personally, I bawled for the last 10 minutes straight). It's heartbreaking, and emotional... and so very, very true. But most of the time, it is actually hilarious to the point where you start crying because you're laughing so much. I won't name any particular scenes (I promised, no spoilers), but I haven't seen a movie that made me laugh so much for a very long time. So thank you. Thank you Ol, Judy, Gary, Catherine, Phyllida, Richard, Rita and Tom.  Thank you Christine, Pierce, Dominic, Alexa, Colin, Andy, Lily, Jessica, Amanda, Stellan, Julie, Cher and - my love and my whole life - Meryl. But most of all, thank you to ABBA, to Benny, Bj√∂rn, Agnetha and Anni-Frid for these songs. Nothing like this would have ever been possible without your work. Nothing touches our soul quite like music. So thank you. Thank you for the music ‚ù§",0,0,Jessica Westhues,XcSMdhfKga4,0.18612770562770564,2018-07-20 04:24:11,False,True
