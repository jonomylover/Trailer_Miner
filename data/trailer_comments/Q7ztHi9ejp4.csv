2018-10-11T16:34:20,"Dear Mr. Shyamalan, When I first saw unbreakable, I was fascinated and amazed by the kind of performance delivered by the cast (in 2014) Then came split. It was a normal day when I switched the Television on and decided to watch Split for the first time. I had completely fallen for James Mcavoy all over again after wanted and was completely blown by his performance.  As the movie ended, in the scene when David Dunne takes Elijah's name, Mr. Glass and the Unbreakable music started, I was filled with extreme joy and didn't take another second to guess that the Horde, Dunne and Glass belonged to the same universe.  Then, I dug deeper and found out that Split has a sequel and I just can't describe my reaction when i discovered that Glass releases on my birthday (18 January) I went completely gaga over it and am so, very delighted.  So, I wish the movie and everyone great luck knowing that it'll surely be a raging success.  From a fan and a fellow Indian.

When they first meet, Cole initially mistakes him for a certain psychologist he once knew. During the climax, a dude with one buff arm saves David's life by staring down the Beast long enough for police SWAT teams to gun him down with snipers and assault rifles, because in this more realistic universe the police actually shoot and kill people. Elijah escapes with the help of some wolves made out of vines who carry him to an old fashioned village in the middle of a forrest where he's ultimately defeated by a blind girl who accidentally trips and knocks him over breaking his neck. Thus Mr. Glass is ironically defeated not by a superhuman with incredible abilities that he's so obsessed with, but instead by another person with a disability like himself. In the after credits scene, Mark Walberg cameos as a delusional man with a serious phobia of plants who spots one of the vine wolves and starts screaming, ""It's happening again!""",0,0,Mirror Zone,Q7ztHi9ejp4,0.020774976657329598,2018-10-12 15:09:04,True,True

The girl from Split has mind/psionic powers and telekinesis she tries to contain the damage, then Glass watching from distance sees a kid on a wheelchair stuck among the wreck in the street. Glass starts shouting at Beast/Kevin to stop but the man is too far gone and as he throws David into a wall, bricks detach and begins to fall on the kid. Elahja propels as fast as he can on his wheelchair and saves the child shielding him. David emerges from the pile of bricks and concrete and sees the man dying with the kid in his arms and with his last breath he tells him: ""I was wrong....Let go David....save them....I was wrong.....save them....""   Dunn is outmatched in speed, but in raw strength he has the edge, and he jumps onto the Beast and propels him throw walls like a battering ram then punches him into a an elecrical power turret.

I miss Blade also just blade  and blade 2. Mature super hero movies are always better less comedy ( comedy only when needed, not a bunch of jokes throught the entire fucking film like marvel.) Id rather have a bad ass story and fight scenes over a bunch of comedic scenes....  action movies have lost their touch as of late tying to be fucking saturday night live and a fucking action film... it just dont work it pleases the kiddies and the adults who cant handle a deep plot but not the hardcore movie goer.",0,0,Old Blood,Q7ztHi9ejp4,-0.05717468805704099,2019-05-08 05:50:01,False,False

It's a hot pic so without knowing that I'll be back in two days I think I'll go ahead and add Glass to my wish list.  Of note is that Glass is more than your average movie.  It is actual a DNA particle accelerator for the 2019 King Jam conference.  Yeah Tomas and I are rendering Cyrus in 3-D so as to allow the spectrum of light to gather around the collider rings as we shoot ion spheres into a 360 degree and 3-D printed apparatus.
