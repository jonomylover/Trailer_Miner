2018-06-07T21:08:46,"Me 62 Year-Old Da was a cameo in a Scene of ‚ÄúA Star Is Born‚Äù Movie. He got paid more than $80.00 dollars for 8-12 hours (That was filmed in Palm Springs, California, where me Da lives and I used to live there) that he was there as a audience member in a wee crowd just standing there watching Bradley Cooper act drunk on stage. He also saw Lady Gaga from far away too! He said to me that there was peep‚Äôs telling him and others what to do. For example: Having them cheer, clap, and other things. Also I was so jealous that he did this without telling me üò≠üò≠üò≠ I cannot believe that me Da, in his 60‚Äôs, would do this. This all happened in October-November 2017 Time-Frame. But I cannot wait to see this Movie the day before me Birthday, which is October 6th, and maybe spot me Da (If that Scene didn‚Äôt get cut out or anything in the final product)! I was so surprised that Bradley Cooper could sing and play the guitar. He is also really wonderful. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Lady Gaga. She‚Äôs one of me favourite singers besides Lana Del Rey and Halsey üíúüíúüíú  Also she looks very pretty and beautiful in this Movie too. I did not even recognise her! But I would love to cast her in one of me future Movies üòçüòçüòç The Trailer itself was so so so amazing and very well edited. Just wow. I am in love with it. I literally got chills whilst watching it. One of me favourite trailers that I watched in me entire Life. From watching this Trailer... The camera shots/angles, cinematography, music, etc. looks so spot-on good. Bradley Cooper did a good job directing this Movie aswell. The story itself, the acting of Lady Gaga/Bradley, music selections, etc. looks really good too. I never heard of the ORIGINAL Movie, which this one is based off of, but I think is is going to be a better version of it. In me near future... I am going to be a Movie-Director/Actress.

She truly has an amazing voice, and she definitely doesn't need all the makeup and costumes, she's gorgeous naturally.  And Bradley's always been good in my books (and hot!), and now we know he can sing too!  I've love to agree with other commenters about this getting awards, but I don't trust the industry to actually award good work.  I've sat through stupid award shows too many times, only to be disappointed by the actual winners.  If I love a movie, actor, etc...they don't win.  I sat through the damn awards a few months ago hoping The Greatest Showman music would win, only to swear at the tv when it didn't.  I do hope this movie has better luck!",0,0,WMK Wende,nSbzyEJ8X9E,0.24771634615384613,2018-06-09 02:18:47,True,True

Now there more remakes of  A Star is Born, in1936 &1954(< w MOST beautiful& TALENTED Judy Garland, which I've  been wanting to see& also would like to see the other, guess i got 3 of these i got to seeüòè).  I saw A Star is Born in my mid teenage yrs& fell SO in LOVE with this movie!!! & the soundtrack of this movie is SENTATIONAL!!!! these 2 actors just had that chemistry that made the movie SO beautiful &perfect, that movie when actors JUST meant to be to play those roles... like for an example""Steel Magnolias"". Now there has been remakes that have had good progress, but no matter what people are going to compare these 2 chemistry from the other2, it just always like that. I do VERY much believe that a remake should be given a chance& to criticize by the movie alone(i would definitely do that) but,again it's hard not to compare it too.  üëçWishn you tha BEST Bradley Cooper & Stephanie(Lady Gaga).",0,0,Rocio Danforth,nSbzyEJ8X9E,0.4864761904761904,2018-06-09 10:38:45,True,True

2018-06-09T11:14:47,Another version?  I suppose that it is one of those stories that you can tell again and again and again while always putting it into the present day. Judy Garland's My Man and Barbara Streisand's Evergreen were said to have brought goosebumps in their day.  I think the first telling of the tale was of two classic musicians.  The last scene being him listening to a radio broadcast of her playing before walking into the sea.  I can't help but think that maybe films like this help perpetuate the myth that suicide can be noble.,0,0,LoriCiani,nSbzyEJ8X9E,0.2033333333333333,2018-06-09 11:14:47,True,True

She got back to the filmings really emotional and performed that song. That scene is gonna be the realest thing EVER.

Anyway, it's nice to see Lady Gaga as an ordinary person in a larger than life full-blown movie, a far-off always exciting that way look on his/her MTVs! With the way they put the trailer, it's like seeing Lady Gaga as in every inch a woman so different from the way we know her as a cross-dresser like CHER! Definitely, we welcome this long-waited MOVIE debut for him/her so she will need not any of those Leonardo DiCaprio brouhaha like in previous Oscars where she guested as a stage performer. Remember when it's Leonardo DiCaprio's time to be born as a STAR via CASPER The Friendly Ghost opposite Cristina Ricci in the 90s when he is still a Leonardo De Carpio! :-) I think. all what Leonardo said, when Lady Gaga passed towards his seat is, ""What happened to Kevin?""- while laughing.   #LADYGaga #MovieDebut #Year2018 #BradleyCooper #AStarisBorn #October Lady Gaga debuts in the remake of Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristopherson's A Star Is Born 1979.

Male singer is super alcoholic.. goes to a bar super drunk.. finds a female singer singing his own song better then him. Asks her to join him saying he'll train her. Trains her (seen practicing (Indian version: chahun main ya na (must listenüòç))). They fall in love. She becomes a star. He is a flop now and she retreats herself in order to save him.. they get away from fame for some time. The manager of male lead finds them and asks them to come back. Male lead forces her to go get her stardom. And if this movie is the remake of Indian version then  SPOILER ALERT:      BRADLEY COOPER COMMITS SUICIDE.  She calls him coward.

So for her show her real face without all her stage make-up was refreshing as she looks like a completely different person. I found that she's actually quite beautiful. It's a shame that in her singing career she feels like she's got a cake on the make-up when she's actually taking away from her natural beauty.  Seems to be a trend in this country for young girls that are influenced by Young Hollywood celebrities and musicians to wear enormous amounts of makeup in order for them to make themselves feel and look beautiful when that's quite the contrary such as this example with Lady Gaga. I find her to be incredibly attractive in this movie and she looks like a completely different person but much more beautiful than her stage version.

2018-10-06T01:52:35,"My normal genre is listening to hard rock and the like...but after catching Lady Gaga in American Horror Story and thoroughly enjoying watching her act, and then opening myself up to hear her sing, and then finally watching this movie trailer...I have to say that this woman is one of the most beautiful, talented, and amazing ladies that I have ever seen...and her singing makes my eyes water up every time I hear her songs. Lady Gaga has such incredible talent; and I'm honestly mesmerized by her performances. Heaven has a special place for Lady Gaga. Stefani is truly a class act; and if her heart is as genuine on the inside, as what you can see and hear from her performances on both film or stage, then she is truly an angel on this earth. I feel like many good actors/actresses can project a piece of their inner-selves into their performances, and if this is the same for Lady Gaga, then she is perhaps one of the most honest and amazing stars that have ever existed. Normally I never offer-up these compliments to anyone, let alone a pop star or actress because I'm not a person who like to idolize others, but my God, Stefani has such incredible talent. I grew up with a father who made his entire living as a musician and guitar teacher, and I've been singing and playing guitar my whole life so far...and I sometimes just daydream that I could actually jam out with Lady Gaga. That would definitely be a bucket-list wish if I could ever have the honor of meeting Lady Gaga. I learned about Lady Gaga's past from what she's told others about growing up and getting discovered; and I hope that maybe one day I too can get recognized as well. Who knows; maybe if I got my name out there and I was big enough, I could talk Lady Gaga into doing some music together (a guy can dream, right? haha) There's obviously a reason why Lady Gaga has become so incredibly famous (because her talent deserves it)...but for someone like me who usually has your normal ""guy"" tastes in hard rock or action films and whatnot...I will always pause to hear or watch Lady Gaga act, sing, or speak. Lady Gaga's fiance is an incredibly lucky man for being in the presence of an angel; and I hope he always treats her like the queen that she is.",15,5,enigmarocker,nSbzyEJ8X9E,0.26419642857142855,2018-10-06 01:52:35,False,True

For the first time since 1999 i was transported into an experience while watching a movie.  You and your cast took me on a roller coaster of emotion.  I believed you were Jackson.  The authentic and naked delivery of Lady Gaga‚Äôs performance when coming on stage with Jackson for the first time made the hair on my arms stand up it was so electrifying.  The on screen chemistry was able to successfully weave a romantic tapestry that was later used to show the frayed edges that would be prayed upon.    The moment in the film that is one of the most powerful i have ever seen in a movie, is the conversation between Bobby and Jackson in the driveway when he is dropping him off.  I was blown away at how you and your cast were able to render such powerful and emotionally charged seconds on screen that made me have to hold back my own tears.  I lived inside of that moment with Bobby and Jackson from both of their perspectives.    If i had any criticisms for this movie, it would be that the initial romance happens very quickly, but because of the effective eye of director, it was pulled off successfully.  Lastly, I could appreciate how you used a very diplomatic approach in addressing the shortcomings in the music industry by pruning the tree instead of chopping it down.

2018-10-13T19:26:11,"""A Star is born"" will always be remembered for the voice and interpretation of Barbra Streisand and luckily did not try to re-edit the second Version. Lady Gaga's Voice arrangements were absolutely beautiful, touching and moving as they should be. this is a new version and we have to forget who watched any of the first 2 versions and focus on the chemistry of Gaga and Cooper. I loved every song released so far and I can't wait to buy the Soundtrack. Singing only Gaga already deserves to be rewarded and I believe that her performance will be passionate, poignant, strong and in a certain way Delicate. Gaga is much better at actually interpreting real songs and escaping from that silly pop with which she launched herself to Stardom. In ""Joanne"" she has demonstrated that it can go much further and now with this trail we know that really ""A star is born"". Hoping she wins many prizes with her performance, without forgetting Cooper who is simply perfect in her role, it seems that it was written to match exactly with the personality he created for the character in the Film.

This girl was born to a well-to-do family,got a record deal at 19,had her first smash hit in her early 20s,and has been a legendary pop icon ever since. She did all of this while mocking Christianity and Jesus himself constantly in her concerts and even in her videos... and she did all this with little to no backlash in what is supposed to be a ‚ÄúChristian country‚Äù. Not only is she a TV star,but is about to be a movie star with a movie once again pushing her character as a girl that is being held down by the establishment.   The scene in the trailer shows her talking about how her nose is ‚Äútoo big‚Äù for her to be a star... clearly this is trying to reference her in real life,not just the character in the movie,and trying to garner sympathy for her. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing to be sympathetic to this woman about- this is not due to hatred towards her. It‚Äôs just I can‚Äôt stand seeing someone who has had so much success(and is there anyone out there who is holding her down because of her looks?..most people praise her as attractive) being portrayed as someone who has been held down,or had to rise above so many obstacles... give me a fucking break.    If you‚Äôre a fan of hers,fine...but that doesn‚Äôt make this kind of bullshit any less bullshit.  you don‚Äôt have to be held down or someone who had to rise above your circumstances to be loved and appreciated.

2018-10-24T22:54:12,"I remember the critical reaction to the 1976 version of this movie; Streisand was brutally mauled for making a ""vanity film"".  She was egomaniacal.  She gave herself too many close-ups.  She was out of place in the rock world.  All of which is pretty outrageous when you compare it to this latest version.  Bradley Cooper has taken this classic melodrama - which is called A Star Is Born and has, in all previous versions, been about just that: a rising star - and made it predominantly a story of addiction, self-destruction and male angst.  In other words: he has totally reversed the dynamic of the movie and made it mostly about his character, downgrading the rising star aspect of the story in the process.  He gives himself more screen time than his co-star (and way more than any of the previous actors playing his role).  He adds characters (like his brother) and backstory, that make the story more about Jackson Maine than about Ally (who, please note, doesn't even warrant a second name).  And he makes it an overwhelmingly male film.  Ally's only ""female"" friends are drag queens!  Cooper even manages to make himself look good, even while playing drunk and dishevelled, while stripping Gaga of all make-up (which makes her look plain) for half the film, then cursing her with a star makeover that makes her look like one of her drag queen friends.  But where Streisand was lambasted for being narcissistic and egomaniacal, Cooper is being hailed for his direction and performance.

2018-11-06T15:23:59,"üí´ I took my kids to see ""A Star Is Born"" the other night, & I must confess; this iconic love story about star-crossed lovers & their tragically misaligned career-trajectories invoked a wee degree of existential rumination in me.  Bradley Cooper plays a whisky voiced country-rock star by the name of Jordan Maine whose comet has begun to wane. Lady Ga Ga plays Allie, a diffident waitress whose talents remain mere smolderings until that chance encounter--Jordan, searching for a place to drink, stumbles onto Allie's breathtaking cabaret performance in a drag bar.  I've seen three other variations on this plot, but this one far exceeds its progenitors. There's much I could say about this version of ""A Star Is Born,"" but for the sake of brevity, I'm just going to focus on how this movie seems to mirror today's cultural zeitgeist.  This movie trailer I posted opens up with my favorite song from the film, ""Maybe It's Time to Let the Old Ways Die."" Maine keeps coming back to this folksy country ballad as it seems like an important statement of theme & purpose for the story; the song's not only an exploration of what's actually happening when this grizzled crooner plucks young Allie out of obscurity, but on a larger scale, the elegiac lyrics also seem to reflect some kind of protracted extinction of the 'old-white-guy' & everything this demographic may have once stood for: ""üéº Maybe it's time to let the old ways die/It takes a lot to change a man/Hell, it takes a lot to try/Maybe it's time to let the old ways die/Nobody knows what awaits for the dead..."" I hope I'm not spoiling the ending for anybody here, but considering how the protagonist has killed himself in each of the 3 previous Hollywood versions, I imagine y'all have gotten the memo on this one.  'Purposelessness' leads to suicide, & being a proponent of logo-therapy, I'm always trying to motivate my students to find a purpose in life or as the French call it, a 'raison d'etre.' Without a sense of purpose, depression naturally sets in, & it's obvious that Jackson Maine is indeed depressed. Atop of all his issues that he numbs with alcohol, he also recognizes that his gritty style of music is about ready for the glue factory. & to make matters worse, he's losing his hearing & pondering whether or not he's ready for the glue factory, himself... 84% of people who kill themselves are white & about 77% are men. You could say the character Jordan Maine is the poster-boy for these stats.  All in all, I think men are their own worst enemies. They tend not to openly discuss their feelings. Jordan Maine had an opportunity to talk about his insecurities with Allie as they lay in bed before her big show, yet he chose to keep the conversation laconic while masking his core depression with a spurious smile. I can't help but to imagine that if he'd been more forthcoming about how badly he felt for having sullied Allie's public-image with much of his self-destructive alcoholism, that they could have found another resolution other than suicide... Anyhow, I didn't cry. I wanted to--mainly because this particular issue haunts me till this very day. But I didn't want to appear to be a wuss in front of my girls.  & I suppose that's the crux of the problem right there...  Maybe it‚Äôs time to let the old ways die. üé¨ Bottom line, this movie gets a strong thumbs up from this ol' cowboy. üëçüèº",9,5,David S Connelly,nSbzyEJ8X9E,0.07966058763931107,2018-11-06 15:23:59,False,True

2018-11-26T03:29:20,"I know I'm a tad bit late. Though, in this case it's better late than never. I just saw this wonderous movie at around 6 o' clock today. It made my heart ache, it made me yearn, it made me laugh, and it made me cry. Above all else it made me fly. The scenes are effortless, the dialogue miraculous, and the actors are diamonds in the rough. I'm a hopeless romantic. However, I will say the gene has gotten a bit typical and a tad bit cookie cutter. Rest assured there is nothing mundane about this movie. It is electrifying and gravity defying. Utterly superb. There is nothing this movie can't do. It is a one man band. Watch it! It changes you.    I think *Shallow* and *Maybe It's Time* are the two songs that truly chronicles and heightens their relationship. The highs, lows and the straining woes.    *Shallow* *Jack* *Tell me Something Girl*...*Are You Happy In This Modern World?* *Or Do You Need More?* *Is There Something Else Your Looking For?* Ally is arguably legendary in her own right. Yet she's a restaurant worker by day and a dabbling musician by night. *Shallow* *Ally* *Tell Me Something Boy*... *Isn't It Hard Trying To Fill That Void?* *Or Do You Need More?* *Is There Something Else You're Searching For?* Jackson Maine is a battered and fragile shell of a man. His career is plateauing and his demons from his tultumous childhood are ever showing. He feels like the world wants so much of him and yet he's gotten so little in return.   *Ally* *I'm Off The Deep End*.... *Watch as I dive in.* *I'll Never Meet The Ground.* *Crush Through The Surface, where they can't hurt us.* *We're Far From The Shallows Now.*   As far as Jack is concerned he is just numb and plagued. He just doesn't care anymore. He just let's the alcohol settle the score. As far as Ally is concerned she has always been rather reserved and semi ordinary. Now she is putting herself out there. Making her gift known. She knows the full extent of her conquest and she's not looking back.     Maybe it's time centers on for whom it was written. Jack. *Maine* *Maybe It's Time We Let The Old Ways Die.* x1 *It Takes A Lot To Change A Man and it takes a lot to try. *Maybe It's Time We Let The Old Ways Die.* *Nobody Knows What Waits For The Dead.* *Nobody Knows What Waits For The Dead* *They Just Believe In The Things They've Heard and The Things They've Read* *Nobody Knows What Waits For The Dead* It's telling really. In with the old, out with the new. Ally's career ultimately flourishes while Jackson's wilts.   The death part always got to me as if you see through him and not at him I believe you can see his fate. He's acknowledging his shortcomings and transgressions to me but nonchalantly and unapologetically. It just is what it is. It is his destiny. It rocks me to my core. Hauntingly beautiful indeed.   Lastly, as far as I'll Never Love Again goes. It's always been a tear jerker for me. Upon learning that Jackson wrote it. I begin to dissect and inspect it from his POV. Basically, I feel as though it was his cry for help.   He is practically staying that if he can't be with Ally then he just doesn't want to be at all. It just would never be the same. He doesn't want to go on without her. He's made up his mind given the circumstances and the overall frothy reception from her camp that he is no good for Ally. She is beyond his reach. She deserves better, and he's too unpredictable and too jaded. He'll never measure up. He'll never be 100%. Like everyone else in his crappy yet eventful life she's bound to leave him. He's knows that true love and unity isn't in the cards for him the second time around.   He doesn't want to be a mere shadow. He'll always love her but if he can't have her wholly and sincerely then he doesn't want anything. The lines * I Would Rather Wait For You,* *I'll Never Love Again,*  *Won't Let Another Day Begin* *Won't Even Let The Sunlight In* and *No other name falling off my lips* a test to that.   All in all it was a gripping film that pulsed with vigor and with sorrow. Ally gave him a home and he drove her spark to the forefront and that ultimately led him home. All he ever wanted was to protect her innocence, nurture her creativity, protect her soul, and laminate her serenity. He just wanted her to be Ally. Stress free and restriction free.   He wanted to be for her what no one ever was for him. A true confidant and a true friend. He just wanted to cherish and uplift her and he did up until the very end. üò™ü§ßüëè‚úç",64,20,Quayle Jay,nSbzyEJ8X9E,0.1250819887183523,2018-11-26 03:29:20,False,True

And Bradley Cooper I dunno I like him or not as actor.  Put it this way Widows was more my kind of film.   I watched the original 1930's film and that did'nt grab me too much either.   if you like lady gaga then watch it for sure.   they also rip off or is it pay tribute to good will hunting,  it's not your fault speech,    widows they copy alot of heat, taxi driver and maybe pulp fiction,  but for me there were so many good performances,  I don't like Bradley Cooper potrayal of sniper in iraq war as heroic, either,  illegal war,  innocent people killed. it is hard to direct a film you star in,  stay past the end of the subtitles and he talks about making the film, which was interesting.

I just saw that the movie - in the cinemas - has already grossed about 8 or 9 times the production cost, which of course is great for the producers of the movie. I really don't want to sound all negative, but I didn't really like the acting style of Mrs. Gaga either. It seems she is struggling a lot to do it right. In addition - to this day - I still don¬¥t understand how Jack knew the song 100% with all the verses and words, considering he only heard parts of the song in a parking lot, where he was also quite wasted. But that does not change the fact that even though he did not even hear the full chorus of the song, he manages to play the full song and know all the words of the song at the concert, where he pulls Gaga on the stage.

And he got better and even if he did relapse he would have gotten better again. For ally because he FUCKING LOVED her so much. All that manager cared was the tour and the money that came from it. Such raw depiction of emotions by both Bradley and Lady Gaga. Felt each and ever heartache and each and every love. My heart is so full. Bradley is one hell of an actor and director. The award scene broke me to the core. And Lady Gaga is just so freakin talented. And so beautiful. Way to go both of you!

2019-01-25T23:50:38,"A couple of reviews (from the same person?) gave this 6/10 and stated this being a decent movie, but not Oscar¬Æ-worthy. I thought that crappy movies always get those golden statues... If I quickly think of three movies that I really like and go back to regularly have IMDb ratings as follows: 3,7; 6,1; 4,2.  If you're into ready-chewed Hollywood tripe, this movie is definitely for you. If you don't like to think for yourself and do not like any individual thoughts to be provoked inside your mind, this movie is for you then too. But if you do not want everything explained to you nor presented to you in a way so simple that an explanation isn't necessarily even needed, then this movie isn't for you. But ‚Äî again ‚Äî this is coming from a guy whose quickly-thought all-time top 3 average on IMDb is 4,67.  Apropos, a new meme review-wise on the social media/YouTube and here on IMDb seems to a ""review coming from an old marine"" ‚Äî as if that would really validate and give weight of significance to it. Pshaw! The rest of the world is mostly laughing at your sad attempts to bring ""democracy"" all over the world by bombing, destroying and murdering people ‚Äî of which majority do not have anything to do with the war that you are feeding with your politics. Or trying to use what used to be the definition of macho man par excellence ‚Äî now stripped to a sentimental, sobbing, chick-flick-watching pansy ‚Äî to promote for LGBBQTPHIVXYZ, white genocide or whatever it is that is seen profitable by the elite. USA! USA!  War is business not different from the enormous machinery of Tinseltown that must spew out products at a certain rate. This hasn't had anything to do with art for a long, long time anymore, using test screenings i.e. market research and altering the films based on them. It's just politics, mind-poisoning, propaganda and money-laundering. The same goes to pop music. It's all just industry.  And now we get to the ""star"" herself: Lady Gaga. Born in 1986. Marvelously, just literally out of nowhere popped into the biggest commercial fame and mainstream pop success in 2008. I repeat: out of nowhere. She is an artifact; a product. Completely artificial. There's nothing real about this character. All the stories of her artsy, underground background are just make-believe ‚Äî nothing more. If she really had been somebody in the circles of the New York scene in the 90s or early 00s, she would've been then a mere child not old enough to even have pimples on her face, let alone a prodigy dubbed as ""Lady Gaga"" by her peers.  Then you get the fake YouTube hits, likes, followers and subscriptions from India and China ‚Äî and the rest is history: a ""star"" is born, indeed. Well, she does belong to a certain group of people that control the media and entertainment. Just look at the agenda that she is so loudly promoting and sponsoring for. The gay star Bradley Cooper fits to that world of views and values better than well, just to tip you off to the right direction. She doesn't have her other eye revealed on this flick, though, but I guess everyone understood the point regardless.  ""Lady Gaga is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, activist, businesswoman, fashion designer and actress."" So, she is pretty much everything but a singer. That's normal these days. It's not the singing that gets these people far ‚Äî it's all the other things that are part of the trade. It would be best to call her an actor ‚Äî even though she clearly isn't too good at that either. But ‚Äî hey! ‚Äî that hasn't stopped the trophies from rolling in before.  Get out your hashtags, Twitters, Twatters and whatnots: the hype is here. Indoctrinate! Spread the word! It's cool and trendy to do so. You don't want to be different, do you? The ones who saw this at a pre-screening knew this well in advance: it's going to be a hype, because you were told it's going to be a hype. You probably even got to press a red button or a green button depending on whether you liked the ending or not.  It's all about the product placement and the propaganda ‚Äî primarily i.e. what is seen on the screen and secondarily i.e. what lies behind the production: the choice of actors etc. Art ‚Äî if there is room for any ‚Äî comes only tertiarily. Having said that:  see you at the Academy Awards¬Æ!",1,0,burteriksson,nSbzyEJ8X9E,0.10642666157372038,2019-01-25 23:50:38,False,False

But this movie also made me realize no matter how many people around you love you so much or how much money you have, you can still be broken. A lot of people don't say anything about it because they don't have the voice to. They keep it inside of them and then that leads to bad things. My heart goes to all people who are extremely depressed and feel like they don't have nothing to live for, people who feel empty inside no matter how many times they smile or laugh, people who hide themselves...who hide their emotions. People who take drugs and continuously drink alcohol/wine to forget something that has made a permanent mark in their mind. Whoever's reading this, I love you. You will get through this. Times are rough but don't ever give in. You have so much to live for...cry if you need to, but also tell someone how you're feeling. Tell someone your emotions. Don't hide them...please don't give up on yourself. I love you and I want you to be the best you as much as possible. Don't think about all the bad things.

2019-04-23T00:00:54,"My personal opiniated review (WARNING FULL SPOILERS). This movie starts out great, non-linear story line, more like an indie film...really about the music; Bradley's songs sound like real legit hits and he nails acting guitar and plays solos in his own style. Gaga is just as real, musically is different style for her and folk flower child look which is cool. Then the film gradually nosedives because Gaga a la typical Britney Spears plays corny pop dressed skimpy (yawn) in full stereotype, says doesn't want to dye her hair and does, seems very contrary to character stubborn Italian NYC roots being typical Hollyweird producer puppet and Bradley just goes along with this selling out? Yeah stupid, nonsensical to character traits, and to top it off winning awards when the music sounds like crap. Then Bradley's alcoholism for some reason gets worse then for some reason Dave Chappelle just shows up, character seems forced; like hollyweird did their 5th re-write and wanted to throw another big name in the movie to sell it. Seems lame. Could have addressed the addiction issue better but by this time Bradley is constantly hanging his head down to his ankles you'd think get this mofo to a chiropractor cause he's got osteoproris. Then the typical Gaga chicanery, naked, hanging with cross dressers, the woman's personal life/carrier of  hedonistic videos, lifestyle, and satanic ceremonies (Marina Abramovic) coming thru onscreen. Whatever. 2nd/3rd acts just typical script format, wins girl, falls in love, pisses off girl, rekindles love, then Bradley.... kills himself?  Uh okay, talk about depressing. Then Gaga sings an epitaph. Boo hoo. By this time I'm fast forwarding cause the agnostic rubbish put forth is more emptiness without hope or meaning. For once how about a film with hope, meaning and the music meshing. Another script ruined by Hollyweird this had great potential stop the cookie cutter stereotypical BS and go full indy with originality, fleshed out characters and more of a message sent not contrite rubbish.",0,0,Big J Enterprises,nSbzyEJ8X9E,0.10631313131313132,2019-04-23 00:00:54,False,False

Edit: i did not know until now that this movie was a remake and it actually has old versions as well and Bollywood version is actually rip off of this movie. In addition i m more disappointed at Bollywood that they did not even mention or give any credit to this movie, instead went on like it was their own creative idea which i seriously was surprised about.. I mean bollywood being creative and produce such a great story??

The ones where I thought it might be good and actually watched anyway. This was one of, if not the only time I'm actually disappointed. The whole movie is the kind of genre I usually like, some pretty good songs, and some great acting, but as a whole the story and how it's told is just boring. I haven't even watched the previous version to compare it to. I guess considering it's a remake of something that started so long ago, it's understandable that the story is predictable and cliched. That wasn't all though, the way they show him spiraling down, you can clearly tell, but I just don't really feel it.   I really don't see how this is  best picture worthy.

2020-05-02T18:14:09,"Sharing is caring. Dear Friend, ARE YOU SAVED?  IF YOU DIED TONIGHT WILL YOU GO TO HEAVEN OR HELL?  The Bible says: ‚ÄúGod is holy and heaven is holy which means perfect. God can never let anybody or anything imperfect or sinful enter heaven‚Äù.  Have you ever lied once? Stolen once? Hated once? The answer is yes. This makes you a liar, a thief and a murderer according to God. So if you were to die this night you will go to hell because you have sinned and the punishment of sin is death.      The excellent news is that GOD wants you in heaven with Him. But as a just GOD, He has to punish your sins. He has provided a way to save you .There is someone perfect who was willing to take your punishment, mine and the one of the whole world.   John 3:16 says: ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.‚Äù  So Christ died on the cross for our sins.                                     WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BE SAVED?  1-	Admit you are a sinner.                                      2-Be willing to turn to Jesus as the only one who can save   you(repent).                                      3-Believe that Jesus died for you, was buried and rose from the dead, according to the scriptures. Romans 10:9 says: ‚Äúthat if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.‚Äù                                      4-Now through prayer, invite Jesus into your life to become your personal saviour.                                       5- Pray this prayer of salvation :( Say it aloud)  Dear God, I come to you in the name of Jesus. I admit I am a sinner. I thank you that you loved me so much to send Your Son to die in my place. I believe in my heart that Jesus Christ died on the cross and shed His blood for my sins, was buried and rose again.  I ask you to forgive me,Father.  I now invite you Lord Jesus, to come into my heart and life as my personal Lord and Saviour. Amen.  NOW YOU ARE SAVED OR BORN AGAIN WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER?                     1-Read your Bible everyday to get to know Christ better and all that He has in store for you ( healing, deliverance ,prosperity etc.)  2-Talk to God in prayer everyday.  3-Be baptized, worship, fellowship and serve with other Christians in a good bibelbelieving church.  4-Tell others about Jesus.  NB: Congratulations .You have just made the most important decision of your life by accepting Jesus.
