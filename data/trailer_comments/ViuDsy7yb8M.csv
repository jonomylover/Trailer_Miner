2016-04-12T00:59:06,Normally I think i'd be annoyed that a HP spin off was being set in America (seeing as most films in general are set there and I adored Harry Potter all the more for it being set in England) but this looks to be a really interesting and world building take on the franchise. We already knew there were other wizarding communities (thanks mostly to events and characters that are introduced in Goblet of Fire) but we only got to see slight glimpses of them and there cultures. And here we get to not only see one of these communities but also see it in 1926 a time after world war one but before the likes of Grindelwald/Hitler or Voldemort rose to power. And depending on the direction they are taking this trilogy we may get to meet characters or see events that will be pivotal to building the world we already know.,3,0,narutonemisis3,ViuDsy7yb8M,0.20059523809523808,2016-04-12 00:59:06,True,True

Also, it must have been equally surprising to the author that such predictable plots and characters written for 12 year olds, were snapped up by adults, it was to me. They don't make high dollar movies like this unless an army of analysts predict a good return on investment. It's formulaic, has been from the very start.

2016-04-16T03:14:58,"For those asking ""Is this a prequel?"" No it is not. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a book written and published by J.K Rowling in 2001 about mythological beasts in the Harry Potter universe. Some based on real-life mythical beasts and some straight out of Rowling's wild imagination.  And who is the main protagonist you may ask? Well that is Newt Scamander. Born in 1897. According to the ""About the Author"" section of the book, Scamander became a magizoologist because of his own interest in fabulous beasts and the encouragement of his mother, an enthusiastic Hippogriff breeder. In Hogwarts, he was sorted to Hufflepuff house.  It's kind of book-sception here because the movie(s) is about him writing this book called Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which is a book written by J.K Rowling. I know, confuses me too. Newt is actually mentioned as the author of that book in the Philosopher's Stone. But all in all, there will be no ""origin of Harry's family"" or something like that. It's literally about beasts in Rowling's make belief universe.",1,2,Tasty Meatballs,ViuDsy7yb8M,0.2866666666666667,2016-04-16 03:14:58,True,True

For those who are wondering, I'm American who is a massive HP fan (attached to the books sense I was 8). The story is based on a textbook from the Wizarding world, which is why it's attached to the HP franchise. HP was born in the 80s and went to school in the 90s. Newt Schamander was alive in the 1920s so this movie is a side story of the franchise. (Like Rogue One is to Star Wars). I can't wait for the movie and I'm anticipating the release of HP and the Cursed Child. So happy J.K.

I honestly lost interest after the Goblet of Fire for the books (the decline in quality imo) and more so after Chamber of Secrets for the movies (the shift in tone for the later installments and much I preferred Richard Harris portrayal).  So far this movie's ""magic"" or the mechanics of the wizarding world feel more consistent, and tie in more organically to the rest of the plot.

Now, the entire series' timeline is going to stretch 19 years (1926-1945), just about as old as Tom Riddle was when he came to power. So, if my mind is being coherent, that means the last one or two movies could span throughout Tom's years at Hogwarts and showcase his rise to power. If that doesn't make you excited and craving more, then you need to sort out your priorities.       PEOPLE, WE COULD POTENTIALLY BE GETTING A MOVIE ABOUT TOM RIDDLE'S EARLY YEARS.

2016-12-14T06:07:43,So basically Lord Voldemort must have come into being very close to this time? Now I see where the sister comes in here very intriguing. Queenie was a natural legilimens as was Voldemort. So imagine trying to fight this force of nature. Who could literally read your thoughts as you prepared to attack him lol. This really gives new insight into just how powerful a legilimens Lord Voldemort was. However Queenie didn't need eye contact as when her sister and Newt we're in trouble.  Without going into too much detail here. Queenie in spite of not being on the same floor. Knew something was wrong. Which tells me that she was in tune with her sister's thoughts and emotions no matter where she was at. So I am not sure Lord Voldemort was the most powerful Legilimense.   However it does make you wonder if you were a minister and had an employee with that talent. You would want to use her to weed out traitors and the like. However decent wizards don't use Legilimense without cause. But in Queenie's case she can't help it because she's so strong with it.   However where the story gets really interesting with me is Newt's close relationship with Lita Lestrange. A family name which looms large throughout the Harry Potter Saga. Course Lita doesn't appear here but she does in the form of a picture that Newt carries around with him. All in all Fantastic Beasts is an interesting start. To what is sure to be a very important arc within the Harry Potter timeline.

He does not talk when he should talk to explain certain situation,  he loses his suitcase and not know if he has the right suitcase when he  spot the patypus taking the gold coin. Not just the first time but  second time inside the bank which he should already know the briefcase  was switch and know how important that suitcase is to him but he gets  distracted easier like some simpleton and then outside the bank again  the guy took his suitcase by mistake again.   So many silly parts that could have save time, not got misunderstood  but to move the story along they make him dumbfounded when he should be  talking to explain like when he was in front of the Queen.  Another  situation like using his wand to capture the creature from the jewelry  shop instead of trying to catch it physically and then later he use  finally use the wand only when everything is a mess with the police  coming then he capture it with his wand.   I can go on but I think you get the picture as I don't want to  reveal too much to spoil more for those who have not watched it .. but  the more I see it, the story make me more frustrated as it want me to  stretch my imagination more then I should as a big fan of magical movies  and magical logic.

It felt like buying a cheap fake at the dark corners of the street just because it had the brand name ""Harry Potter"" slapped on it, all the while knowing that I would be ripped off.   I never leave reviews but the amount of disappointment I felt from this, was too immense. I felt ROBBED after watching this rather terrible,,,,,terrible movie.   This reminded me of the movie The Golden Compass which I hated terribly. It had the same sort of magical creatures that look so unrealistic that you simply cannot delve deep into the movie because constantly you are reminded that this is a movie. The CG was even more unrealistic than before (is it just me or do the CGs get worse with the development of computer graphics). Honestly, they relied too much on CG and making the whole movie No-MAG like that it just seemed like AVATAR, which, by the way, I hated terribly as well.   Honestly, this was such a disappointment that I was MAD after seeing it, and I can't believe they are making this look like a spin-off of the wonderful Harry Potter franchise because it does not have the depth nor the characters that we so deeply loved. It honestly has no connection to Harry Potter at all. What I hated most was that the plot was so stupid. Too many things happening at once and none of them being intriguing. The characters were so stupid, they made a terrible choice for the the main character Newt because he seems to be far too much an outcast but at the same time lacks the interesting or even lovable oddities that outcasts usually portray. All the characters were not memorable and they lacked depth so much to the point that I felt no attachment to any of them and I was confused on what side to root for. The climax of the movie ended so abruptly and pathetically that I literally felt like a leaking balloon.   I cannot fathom how this movie has such a high rating, and I think that it is due to the fact that the desperate, crazed and very heartbroken fans of the Harry Potter franchise, who had dearly waited for a movie that contained the charm of Harry Potter, had cast their love upon anything and when that happened, a part of their souls latched itself onto the only living thing that resembled magic that it could find: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them itself.",0,0,Neo,ViuDsy7yb8M,-0.05081920903954798,2017-01-23 06:51:42,False,True
