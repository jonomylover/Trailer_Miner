If I had to rank them, Young boys Inc. were the biggest and the baddest drug ring in Detroit because they had the A-team as their enforcement arm. They'd kill you at the drop of a hat if so ordered to do so. After some years of domination over all drug gangs in the city including the Pony down crew the feds took them down methodically, especially after they killed some cop on Woodward, but the drug laws weren't very harsh at the time when Y.B.I and their supplier Sylvester Murray got busted. I think the Pony down crew got busted next. Both were vicious westside drug gangs by the way. After those two big dope gangs or crews got busted and sent to prison the State stepped in and stepped up their lousy game and came up with that crazy azz 650 grams or more of cocaine or heroin will get you life in prison. Eastside Maserati Rick used to be in our (me and my brother's) Corvette club before he got onto the drug business. Maserati Rick did very well in the game, him Demetrius Holloway and Best Friends ran together they slipped out of a lot of murder cases and dope cases, but eventually Mazerati Rick, Demetrius Holloway and I think one of the brothers that was in the Best friends murder crew got themselves killed (the rest went to prison).Chamber brothers and the Curry brothers crew along with their White boy Rick were in the dope game also, but didn't get on the fed radar until Maserati Rick, Demetrius Holloway and some members of the Best friends crew got themselves killed or sent to prison (Best friends were largely an enforcement arm or should I say: ""a murder crew"" for hire before they finally got a con-nect and started selling huge amounts of narcotics). The bottom line is: Crime only pays for a very very short time. You either get killed or sent to prison and if you are really smart you get otta the dope game........peace.",0,0,Donnie Matonnie,qns48PtK2io,-0.0028851540616246386,2018-09-12 16:36:24,False,True

Unfortunately no mention was made in the film of ""why"" crack cocaine was flooding the streets of U.S. urban areas.  The ""why"" was the Iran/Contra operation being run out of the White House by George Bush, former CIA director through his underling Oliver North.  While Nancy Reagan was telling kids to ""just say no"" to drugs, her husbands administration was up to it's eyeballs in exchanging drugs for arms in order to circumvent the Boland amendment and arm the Contras who were attacking Nicaragua.    Of course none of the CIA operatives, or Bush, or Bill Clinton (who earned CIA presidential cred by nixing State police investigations into the Iran/Contra drugs coming into Mena, Arkansas airport) - ever were prosecuted for this.  Drug runners Bush and Clinton became future presidents while Rick still sits in jail.  That's America.  Violate the law and run drugs on behalf of the government and you get well rewarded, be a small time poor stiff and resell some of those drugs and you spend your life in prison.  Michigan authorities should be shamed into doing the right thing and releasing Rick on parole.

However and I remember hearing about this kid 20-30 years ago being sentenced to life at age 17.  So given the dead emotions prevalent today, why release this movie except for the wow factor? Nobody gives a f__k if there were 100 white boy ricks toing hard time 30 years for nothing? Bear with me, in the 60‚Äôs or 70‚Äôs there was a chance someone might get moved by watching this and there might have been a ripple effect. Maybe today people have become too desensitized by all the carnage prevalent, I don‚Äôt know. What I do know is this is exactly the kind of thinking those in power want so that they are free to do as they please and continue to rape this society. Without help this kid‚Äôs life was waisted. He is now 49 years old. I see comments like why didn‚Äôt he do this or that for his own cause? Wake up and smell the coffee this kid could have been you. Other than dumb luck and random choice he could be you. There‚Äôs a classic film called the time machine. A man travels 800k years into the future populated by a split culture the Eloi and the Morlocks. The Eloi were a kept society where all the necessities were provided by a subspecies called the Morlocks who were subterranean, kept the machinery that supplied the power to run civilization. The price was that the Morlocks fed upon the Eloi who never questioned the circumstances for the fear of losing the good life. We are the Eloi. Once all it took was one life to erect a traffic signal now it is over 30. That‚Äôs how much we are like the Eloi. I see no salvation. Live the best you can while you can.

But like most mafias or drug lords they all come crashing down but that might be a risk worth taking for some. In the 80s major cities were booming with extra profit, cities like Chicago, Miami, Detroit and Cleveland and lawmakers did not want to completely remove it.

2020-03-03T07:23:55,"I am almost the exact same age as Richard Wershe. I grew up just outside of Detroit. I remember reading the newspaper articles about him. My mother would always let me know when there was an article about him in the paper and I was always fascinated at the stories. At the time, the way the paper made him out, I thought he was a drug kingpin. They would show him wearing fur coats and gold rope chains, keep in mind crack and cocaine stories were big and Pablo Escbar was in the news all the time too. My grandmother was over the day there was the article in the paper about him getting a life sentence, I think he was 18 or 19 when he was sentenced. My grandmother was a saint,  she literally was the nicest person on this earth, she never a negative word about anyone in her life, she walked to church every week until I took her to the hospital and she died after surgery at 93 years old, I was the only one with her in the hospital when she died (it was probably the saddest day of my life) because I lived alone and my family all lived in another state. Anyway, that day she was over I told her this 19 year old kid was going to jail for life for being a drug dealer and she sat down next to me grabbed my hand and squeezed it and put her head down and started crying. She was so upset because she couldn't believe they would put someone that young in jail for life. She cried for a long while, I still remember it and that was 1987 I think. After watching the documentary about him I realized it was absolute corruption that kept him in jail all those years, Detroit was and I'm sure still is one of the most corrupt cities in the country. I'm glad he got paroled finally but I wish Donald Trump would get him out for the few years he still has in Florida. I'm not saying he was a saint but he was kept in jail 3 or 4 times longer than murderers that he was associated with for a drug charge because of Coleman Young and other powerful people that never wanted him out for various reasons.",0,0,the wraith,qns48PtK2io,0.033796296296296297,2020-03-03 07:23:55,False,False
