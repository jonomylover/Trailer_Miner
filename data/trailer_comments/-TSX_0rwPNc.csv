Talk about taking the Christ out of Christmas. They're digging in and the soldier interjects to say a grace and then the family finds a chance to make exclamatory blasphemies when they get a rotten smell from the dog. It's made to look like they're mocking the prayer, too. Shocking. 2) The Christian soldier is continually swapping spit with O Wilde. Not that I blame him but it's a commentary on the secular society. The culture whereall endall is sex. That's the good-if we have that chemistry and can bond through physicality. And we wonder why we're a nation of broken families. I'll be raising my girls to be wary of guys who want to get extra physical on that first date. And they will be raised to be looking for a Christian, (which should limit their dating options), because the bible is VERY direct about seeking that in the relationship.
