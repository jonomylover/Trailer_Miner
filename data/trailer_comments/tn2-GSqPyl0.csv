Dreams I can't remember now, hopes that I've forgotten, faded memories. Still I love to see the sun go down and the world go around.  And I love to see the morning as it steals across the sky, I love to remember and I love to wonder why, and I hope that I'm around so I can be there when I die, when I'm gone.  I hope that you will think of me in moments when you're happy and you're smiling. that the thought will comfort you on cold and cloudy days if you are crying.

2015-01-19T13:01:46,"Did multi-month and shorter journeys akin to this (backpacking in National Parks and Forests - mainly in the west) when I was young both in the USA and in Southern Europe.  Did a lot of hitch-hiking on highways and sleeping in train stations in cities, camping ALL OVER the place, in parks, on farmland, on the edges of towns, next to creeks etc.... At that time there were very few solo women backpackers (1980""s).  I travelled both alone and with a girlfriend.   Would I recommend it to women (or men)?   It's pretty darned tough. Not a romantic idealized journey but a test of your strength, a test of your determination, a test of your will.  It most definitely builds character.   Being in nature is very inspiring.  You get to see amazing vistas, wildlife and commune with nature in the most intimate way. You get VERY fit physically and VERY strong mentally.  It helps A LOT to have a meditation practice and to practice prayer (there will be situations in which you will be crying out to God for help).   Perhaps the most dangerous part of travelling is the encounter with the occasional psycho - not so much in National Parks, on trails etc but on the road (especially truck drivers). Sex obsessed truck drivers (and others) who are potentially rapists (I know women who got raped while hitch-hiking in America AND in Europe.  That, I would say is the greatest danger for women.  (Most people you meet are actually very kind and generous).   Another very real danger is bears.  They will take ALL your food if you're not careful.  In Montana and in Canada and Alaska, you have to be very aware of Grizzly Bears.  They are potentially dangerous and you could be mauled and/or killed. Pepper spray is a must as is general Bear awareness.  For any women or men inspired by this film to try a journey like this my advice is:  Start small and start local.  Find a nearby national park and take a 3-4 day backpacking trip.  Once you're comfortable with that, then try a week long trip, then a two week trip etc.   Also, do it while young.  The older you get, the harder it becomes to take journeys like this.   If you do this kind of travel, you'll treasure it for the rest of your days. ",0,0,Martin Franco,tn2-GSqPyl0,0.13332041343669251,2015-01-19 13:01:46,False,True

2016-01-11T04:21:58,"Wow, I'm very disappointed in some of these comments reflecting people's belief that this movie is just a rip-off of Into the Wild. They are completely different movies, and each is excellent in its own way. Into the Wild is a movie about a kid who graduated from Emory University as a successful student and athlete, but decided to donate all of his material possessions to charity and live in the wild to find spiritual awakening. The entire premise of the movie, however, is that despite the spiritual awareness he finds in the wilderness, he identifies that happiness can best be cultivated with others, not alone. Wild is the story of Cheryl Strayed, who after the death of her mother and spending years of risky behavior, decides to make the bold decision of walking the PCT trail on the west coast. She does this for a number of reasons––to heal, to find herself again, to reflect, to live. Flashbacks permeate the film, telling the story of the relationship between Sheryl and the people who have populated her life. It is a movie about redemption, reflection, and adversity. While I understand the outward appearance of significant similarities between the movies, the thematic elements of both are quite different.",397,14,Matt Clark,tn2-GSqPyl0,0.18891184573002756,2016-01-11 04:21:58,False,False

I have not seen the whole movie yet, but it is taken from the ACTUAL story of a REAL person going through real life trauma after her mother died. These days we would call it PTSS or similar. She just had to get away from stupid people who make stupid remarks, and burn herself out physically till she could reach some peace and resolution within herself. If that looks like it is copying someone else, think about it!! That means there are other people going through trauma too and having to get away from humankind to ""lick their wounds"".  Some write, some paint, some go do something physical they have not done before. The ones who don't actively deal with their stress can end up cracking up and damaging people or property to get revenge on the world.

2017-10-06T03:21:19,Oh my gosh like totally being serious here I truly did seen a lot of movies that Reese Witherspoon has done over the years. However this movie right here Wild. not only it's fantastic but it's highly intense as well. I also have to say with all Reese Witherspoon's movies that she has done over the years eve including her new one that just came out to movie theaters home again. There is no other movie that she has done that is so intense as this movie right here. plus I think this is Reese Witherspoon's Masterpiece movie of all times.+ I do not think Reese Witherspoon would ever top this with any other movie that she does at all. Even in the future I think this one right here is her Masterpiece. plus like I said before this is really truly intense & Fantastic. This movie I really enjoyed and loved watching with all her movies that she has ever done. I truly do have to say I think Reese Witherspoon has outdone herself in this movie. She truly did a fantastic role and this movie her character also was the bomb.,2,0,shawn eldridge,tn2-GSqPyl0,0.2094130076272934,2017-10-06 03:21:19,False,False
