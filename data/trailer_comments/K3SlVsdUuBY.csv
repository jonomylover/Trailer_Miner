Draft day felt like advertisement for gmc, Chevy, windows 8, twitter, and probably had 30+ cellular phones ringing and being answered. The shameless product placement was so obvious it was cringeworthy. The movie, to me, reflected how materialistic society has become and how our priorities can get way out of hand (ei. The main character, Sonny, refusing to pay his respects to his father by spreading his ashes in the center of the football field and being disrespectful to his mom, which there was never any conclusive resolution of and he never made things right on).

2015-05-06T07:03:54,"This movie was dumb. The GM first trades 3 #1's for a 1st round pick. The owner wants the hot QB. Then the GM changes his mind and picks his original player using his 1st round pick. Then he trades 3 #2's to get the 5th round pick. Other teams think the QB is damaged goods because the GM passed on him at #1 and so he is still available. The GM then calls the team he traded his #1's to, the team who really wants that QB, and tells them he wants his 3 #1's back plus a punt returner or he'll take the QB as his #5 pick and they won't get him with their #6 pick. They go for the deal and he gets his #1's back and everybody congratulates him on what a genius he is.  Dumb. Here's why:  1. The owner is happy but why? He didn't get his QB. He got the guy he didn't want. 2. The GM effectively cost his team 3 #2's to get the punt returner. Bad trade. 3. Had the GM done nothing and just picked the guy they ended up with using their #7 pick, they'd still be where they ended up (except for the punt returner) AND they'd have their 3 #2 picks as well.
