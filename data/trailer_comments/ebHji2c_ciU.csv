2014-03-30T05:32:19,"The overrated Coen brothers shouldn't be given the job of writing this movie's screenplay. That's like letting an atheist write about the historical account of Noah.  In Zamperini's autobiography ""Devil at my heels"",  Louis makes it crystal clear that the most important part and message of his life isn't about being an Olympic runner, POW survivor. perseverance, determination, or even breaking the all time record of surviving on a raft in the middle of the ocean for 47 days.  It's about the power of Jesus Christ to free us from sin and and  the destructive hold of hate, and the supernatural transformation of being able to even forgive your worst enemies. That's why Zamperini when he sold his story to Universal put in a legal clause that forbids them to exclude his Jesus Christ born again experience.  How can the Coen brothers write about something they can't possibly truly comprehend.  To miss the most important message of Zamperin's life is tragic.  This will be  like Homer missing the main point of Harper Lee's masterpiece  ""Books are useless! I only ever read one book, To Kill A Mockingbird, and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin . . . but what good does that do me?""  Homer Simpson",0,0,Winston Smith,ebHji2c_ciU,0.01805555555555555,2014-03-30 05:32:19,True,True

Always have hope and believe in yourself as Louis Zamperini is saying at the end, ""Don't give up, Don't give in"".  We are a new generation in 2015 here, if you look at this and think what Japanese or American thinks isn't right, then we should find the way to improve these misunderstandings to able to build a better relationship towards future. Looking at the comments, we can tell that the hatred isn't taking us not where, through hatred there is only a conflict between people. If you carry on hating or blaming, it would never improve. I might sound big headed or whatever for some people but I'm only saying this because I'm half American & Japanese and it makes me honestly sad to see what people are commenting about each other.

Well, I guess it is common for some westerners to do so since there are always white people who still have biased opinions towards Asian. Nowadays, people outside of Japan tend to ignore countless war crimes committed by US troops. Besides Hiroshima and Nagasaki, US submarines attacked many Japanese civilian ships and used machine guns to slaughter survivors, US bomber specifically targeted civilians in Tokyo using incendiary bombs and killed over 100,000, executing surrendered soldiers was common and the survive ratio of Japanese prisoners was a shocking 1 to 100, thousands of Japanese ladies were raped during US occupation.
