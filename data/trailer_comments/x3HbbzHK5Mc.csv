2020-01-09T16:22:43,Okay just a couple of nitpicks from the trailer. The opening scene of her driving a truck into ace chemicals I would not be surprised if that the final scene of the movie because they've done that shit before. Also is that seriously the mask that they're using for Roman Sionis? There better be a scene where that shit gets welded or melted onto his face or something because there's no reason why it shouldn't already be attached full time. Why are we still calling this movie Birds of Prey when it's clearly just a Harley Quinn solo film. Yes they might be in the movie but this movie seems more focused on her than anything else. the fight sequences look good and it's nice we finally got a glimpse of the canary cry from Black Canary But other than that this doesn't look like anything I'll be spending my money on.

Cons: - Seriously, can we please have Black Canary look like freaking Black Canary?! - Zsasz seriously looks like a tanner, less doped up Leto Joker.  - Not the biggest Cassandra Cain fan, but according to much of her fanbase, she's not remotely how she's supposed to be in the comics.  - Kinda getting a Suicide Squad vibe coming off this... - Why give Huntress the all black (with a hint of purple), and not BLACK Canary? - Why put Black Mask in a relationship with Zsasz?

2020-01-09T18:56:12,Maybe it's tough to come to the cinema after a Joker movie that was wonderfully realistic and down to earth - but this movie just seems stale and overdone.

2020-01-10T00:05:57,"Before anyone comes with their original comment of ""Leto's Joker sucks, Phoenix's Joker rules.""   Keep in mind, Leto's original performance has never been seen.  His performance was deemed too dark and abusive for test audiences, and they reshot a lot of that stuff to make it more campy.  Just compare his ""I'm just gonna hurt you, really really bad."" take from the very first trailer, to the one in the movie.    A lot of Leto's stuff was cut out, and a lot of his darker takes were redone in a more campy fashion in reshoots.     Imagine if Phoenix's Joker was called too dark by test audiences and they went back and reshot all his parts to be more campy.  His Joker would have problems too.       Under a better script, and actual freedom to be as dark as he wants, Leto's Joker would probably do just fine.

No Batman present and I dont like the idea of Batman neglecting Gotham at least have Nightwing or Redhood have a cameo. All the henchmen characters are male and just knowing how this movie will portray other females besides its main cast will probably only be in the roller derby scene. This movie alienates males and I dont like my DC movies to be this unequal it is obvious the executives have an agenda and it is a shame because it got an R rating and Suicide Squad didnt even get that respect like it should of. If anyone is expecting Jared Leto's Joker to be in this movie I'm warning you now he wont and dont believe anyone who says he will it will just be another actor.

2020-01-10T04:20:42,"I have to admit that this looks a little less terrible than the first trailer.  But other than Margot Robbie, who I think was an excellent choice to play Harley Quinn (now if they would just write a decent movie for her to play Harley Quinn in), the casting looks awful.  Was the best choice to play Renee Montoya a woman in her mid-fifties who was really only ever in one successful movie, and that back in the early nineties?  And because the character is called Black Canary, did they have to change the character's race from the comics?  The MCU didn't feel the need to change the race of Black Widow from the comics.  But let's give the Smollett family another chance at stardom.  Why not?  Mary Elizabeth Winstead actually looks sort of okay as Huntress, but just sort of.     But why are none of the characters in their costumes from the comics?  This is a comic-book movie, right?  It's set in the same film continuity as Wonder Woman, Aquaman, the Justice League, Batman v. Superman, Captain Marvel, etc., isn't it?  So why not put the characters in their costumes from the comics?  Didn't they learn the lesson from that dreadful attempt at a Fantastic Four movie from 2015 that when you make a comic-book superhero movie, it's never a good idea to run away from that fact.  You need to embrace it.     And didn't they also learn anything from Justice League (or Suicide Squad, for that matter) that you can't just throw the team together right away?  One movie does not give enough opportunity to develop all the characters and their motivations.  And if they want to do a Harley Quinn movie, why not just do a Harley Quinn movie?  Why are they mashing it together with this really pathetic version of the Birds of Prey?  Harley Quinn has never been a member of the Birds in the comics.  If they don't think Harley Quinn can carry a film by herself, throwing in a bunch of other characters most people have never heard of isn't going to help.  And we've already seen Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn crowded into a team-movie that was too overcrowded to give any of the characters meaningful character development (even if the script hadn't been a total piece of crap anyway).  Why do another one?  And we've barely seen her relationship with the Joker so far.  How are we supposed to care about her emancipation from her relationship with the Joker if we haven't seen that relationship.  Why should we care about her emancipation when we haven't seen her enslavement?   Here's a crazy thought: do a solo Harley Quinn film that's about her relationship with the Joker from beginning to end, essentially a version of the recent Joker film for Harley Quinn (give Joaquin Phoenix whatever he wants to play Joker in this).  Then build that out into a Harley Quinn film series.  Separately, do a Birds of Prey film that's just Oracle (and yes, you need Oracle in the Birds of Prey) and Black Canary, or maybe also include Huntress.  And cast actresses who actually fit the parts and put them in their right costumes.  And then maybe later add more characters to the team, although the comic was at its best when it was just Oracle, Canary, and Huntress.  Why are they so afraid to use all the source material they have to draw on?  I don't get Warner Bros.  They have made some great superhero films.  I would say that Joker was a genuine work of art.  Wonder Woman and Aquaman weren't at that level, but they were excellent superhero films; certainly I would put them against anything from the MCU.  But then they make garbage like Suicide Squad or Justice League, or, as I fear, this will be.  Sorry for the rant.",0,0,Red Rackham,x3HbbzHK5Mc,0.06089650145772596,2020-01-10 04:20:42,True,True

GOTG 1+2, Thor: Ragnarok, & Infinity War are all really good, but the rest are “meh”. They don’t *feel* like a comic book (Ragnarok & GOTG 1+2 so though). Birds of Prey & Wonder Woman 2 trailers are PHENOMENAL, and they have that comic book aesthetic!! With Aquaman, Shazam, Joker, James Gunn to direct the next Suicide Squad & The Robert Pattinson Batman... I think DC is about to dominate.

If the Batgirl film had been in development on schedule instead of indefinitely shelved because they have it to Joss bloody Whedon, they could have spun a proper Birds of Prey film off from that with the Barbara Gordon character developing into Oracle and handing the Batgirl title off to Cass at the end of the film, and with the Birds coming up against the already established Sirens! It would have taken 2 move films to set up, but honestly being unwilling to make really good character establishing films to lead up to the team up is how we got the current dceu - the only good films are the ones that focus on one character and that don't try too hard to force a shared universe prematurely.

2020-01-11T18:53:09,"It's mildly interesting how Hollywood and the brain-dead zombies whom worship them constantly preach about feminism and the strength of women, yet every time they get the opportunity to back up their words they choke and fail at a golden opportunity to immortalize said beliefs on screen. This is a prime example, instead of sticking with the true story line of Birds of Prey and what it represents, they butcher it, instead of having the group founded by a strong-willed young woman whom continued to thwart crime even after she was made a paraplegic by a psychotic sociopath, they instead have the group founded by the loyal Stockholm lapdog of said sociopath. Even more, instead of being crime-fighters, they're lowered to being bodyguards for said lapdog, and that's not even getting into how the movie even portrays said character's backstories, are they the strong women whom grew strong because of hardships they faced or are they just like Harley Quinn? This isn't the first time Hollywood's spit on the comics and more especially their heroines, Wonder Woman, who has gone toe-to-toe with the likes of Darkseid and Doomsday was reduced to being Steve Trevor's fan-girl in the movies, Jean Grey, a woman with the power to annihilate entire galaxies is reduced to a sniveling little girl in the movies, and Mystique, a woman whom had been around for a hundred years and kicked even Wolverine around is reduced to Magneto's personal pet, whom in the comics, she constantly thrashed and under-minded, even taking over his own group, the Brotherhood of Mutants. I actually do like Harley Quinn, but Birds of Prey is something that shouldn't be butchered in such a way, they could have done a movie based on Harley Quinn's actual comic franchise where she leaves Joker to start her own life in Coney Island, a franchise in which she eventually went to war against Joker and the entire DC villain community and proved herself someone to not be trifled with.",0,0,wolfinferno2012,x3HbbzHK5Mc,0.14490740740740743,2020-01-11 18:53:09,True,True

Hopefully they didn't just give her too much leeway and it is just a mistake because she hadn't played the character for a while when she did the dubbing for this but... I'm not holding my breath.  Fuck. I can't decide if this looks good or not. If this trailer is the best the movie has to offer then it will undoubtedly be a mess. Nothing interesting or funny was shown in this trailer and the whole 'girl power' nonsense is so played out. Can we stop pretending it is some monumental achievement.   Irvine Berlin wrote the song 'I can do anything better than you' in like the 1940's. Eighty fucking years ago. Girl power isn't special and it certainly isn't interesting.  I was glad to see it wasn't framed as being in competition to men but I'm sure that will be explored in the movie.   I'll actually call it now because it is a safe bet but I'm guessing Ewan McGregor is going to be the worst of the worst yet also incredibly incompetent or simply effete.   We'll see hundred pound chicks throw a dude twice their size halfway across a room.   You know, the usual, the same thing we see in all of these movies.   I hope not but I won't hold my breath.

Meaning while she was with Joker no one dared to mess with her out of fear of retaliation. I am eager to see if DC can make a good movie so here is hoping. But honestly I liked Harley more when she was with Joker. They had a good dynamic.  Sure Joker was a brutal, abusive, messed up, obsessed ovet Batman nutcase.

It makes me feel like I am watching a cartoon which makes the stakes that much sillier and thus I don't care about it all.""  Which actually makes sense to me too, chew on that DC Signed - the greatest Batman Fan Ever, and his wife....  See by saying ""and his wife"" at the end I make the point of exactly what you are doing in this movie with Harley Quinn, instead of making a movie dedicated to her you feel the need to involve a bunch of other female villans/heroes to cover up her story instead of just giving us the straight cocaine that is Harley.

Click the link below & tell how characters should have dressed.    2. the main star should had been black canary, 2nd oracle, 3rd huntress. I watched the trailer 2x already & still don’t recall what the b.o.p. team look like. Only the villainess they should be chasing, who is harley quinn.    3. black canary is a white not a black lady.  - Jessica Smollett is a polarizing actress & should have played the afro-american b.o.p. character, Vixen.  - this creates unnecessary feuds & division among ethnic groups.    https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0220/1594/products/pic3235315_1024x1024.jpg?v=1523217545  https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1268199-birds_of_prey__1_018.jpg    4. also 98% of the trailer is focused on the villainess, Harley Quinn, who was never a part of the team.     5. why not have a major evil organization to attack the team: ""the court of owls"", the female ""furies"" who who lead by ""granny goodness.   6. if they wanted to make a popular harley quinn they should made a trio squad of poison Ivy & catwoman, attacking batman, batgirl, & huntress, nightwing.    7 . Rosie Perez is too old to play officer reneé montoya, a character should had be in late teens or early 20s. Rosie Perez is 55. Give me a break.    8. and Ella Jay Basco playing Cassandra cain aka Batgirl (III). Is that a joke?! That should be a batman/nightwing type of movie. Cassandra should be 18 & looks fierce. Ella is too young & does not look tough enough to play the character.     9. This movies looks like an updated version of lori petty character “Tank Girl” 1995.

2020-02-06T14:25:03,"Okay, I just watched Birds of Prey in cinema and here's my insights (NO SPOILERS no worries):  Positive: I've never seen like this! Just awesome. It's all action-packed. It feels so different than other comic book movies. The fight scenes are really iconic and it fits each character's strengths. It's really R-rated. There are cruel death scenes that continues to hunt my mind even after leaving the cinema. Black Mask just justified the film's R-Ratedness. He's the most dreadful supervillain yet. But you'll forget them all the way because the gang are so mischievous, hilarious, and dangerously funny. Questions like why Harley Quinn seems to be the frontrunner of this film than the Birds of Prey themselves was answered clear enough. I get that part and it's really significant for the story's build-up. It was also cleared why Cassandra Cain which was known as one of the members of the Bat Family did not become one in the film. But the Birds of Prey are so lovely (i fell in love with Huntress and Black Canary). Makes me want to see them again in a sequel or spin-off. However, in the end part, I feel like Harley's gonna tell about the Birds of Prey to her Suicide Squad which will probably be a follow-up to James Gunn's The Suicide Squad. Don't know the plans yet but that would be an awesome ensemble.  Negative: Feminism is everywhere in the film. Also, I'm honestly disturbed by some scenes. I didn't see that coming. Black Mask is seriously cruel for me. On the other hand, not all of my questions were answered though. The pacing and sequence of the story was too confusing I can't follow easily. Some say it's a standalone film, but as far as I can see, it really looks like the rotten Suicide Squad sequel because of some few references. The fight scenes were all focused on the middle scenes and they run out of awesome fight scenes in the last 10 minutes of the film which make me feel like the ending was rushed. The Birds of Prey members feels like they were also rushed to be teamed up as it. There could have been more scenes for the rest of the members. Because of this, I think Gotham City Sirens could have been more necessary if Harley Quinn is the point of the film. Watching it the second time? Yes, but with crazy friends.   8.5/10",1,0,RJ Ensalada,x3HbbzHK5Mc,0.12606060606060607,2020-02-06 14:25:03,False,True

But they stuck to her just being crazy and essentially... well... ruthless and evil. At least as far as a PG movie can be. I like that. Also looking forward to Black Mask getting a movie adaptation. Although he seems too cheerful, goofy and happy to be Black Mask. I might just go and watch this DC movie. Didn't think I would be saying that so quickly again, after Shazam.  Edit: Mind you, before any comic or cartoon fans of Batman mention it: yes, in those, Harley is pretty clearly the manipulated victim, but she has been defined as a very willing enabler who is genuinely loved and treasured by Joker in Suicide Squad, so she is essentially a different character.

I’ll say the good: the cinematography is very colorful and energetic, and the acting from Margot Robbie is spot on. Other than that this movie is a mess, it doesn’t really know what it’s even wanting to be other than saying look female empowerment, females fighting and females making the right decisions. I’m all for female empowerment if I wasn’t I wouldn’t be coming to pay for a $17 dollar movie ticket. But this movie is anti men to the point your like just why?! Black mask is a total cry baby douche and that’s everything to his character development. The story is all over the place, messy and non linear. The editing and music is kinda like what they did in suicide squad where they trick you to think your having a good time but your not. The action scenes get really tiring as well.

2020-02-09T14:36:09,Only down side is I think DC screwed themselves by allowing it to be rated R. It’s as if Cathy yan forced the rating. After watching it in a special preview showing I realized this film being R limits their audience reach especially after suicide squad did reasonably well making 800 million. Shazam also did better making around 400 million. Seeing them barely crack 30 million in a weekend is just atrocious. DC doesn’t need to go R rates they are very good at making solid Pg 13 films. I hope they learn from this small mistep. Cathy yan wants to do gotham city sirens which Ayer is already attached to. I pray DC says no to her. I like her but she butchered something that could have been a moderate success for DC.,1,1,XL,x3HbbzHK5Mc,0.0741058201058201,2020-02-09 14:36:09,False,True

The characters were not relatable or interesting in the least and even Harley Quinn seems to have taken a bit of a back seat in regard to her own character. McGregor’s character of black mask Was overblown and way too much to take in. And every single male character in this film was either incompetent, stupid or sadistic in some way. The pacing and story were bouncing all over the place in an attempt to appear quirky as Harley Quinn herself was narrating the story.

The fight choreography is unmatched by even the MCU, the casting is godlike (though the DCEU as a whole has done an excellent job at casting), the new character backgrounds are interesting and shake things up. On top of this is the best soundtrack I've heard in a superhero movie. Add in the unique storytelling style that makes no sense, but is absolutely true to Harley (who is chaotic and spontaneous). It was also nice having Huntress, Canary, and Renee finally be on the big screen, and get the recognition they deserve. LGBTQ+ rep is also great, and not super forced for clout at all. It's literally only casually mentioned in regards to Renee's relationship, and they finally acknowledge Harley's bisexuality once again, in a casual mention with her hitting on Canary. Cassandra Cain is an absolute gem, and really works as a child character without being obnoxious like they usually are. Lastly, its just a fun movie. It's just an exciting, fun, carefree movie that knows when comedy is needed.

The fight scenes were amazing - I often find this part of superhero movies dull and formulaic, but Birds of Prey actually hooked me into them, somehow, with super cool gymnastics, creative twists and fantastic settings - the abandoned carnival was an unforgettable standout. I just loved this movie so much, and I highly recommend it (although maybe not for young kids, it's quite violent). (Probably also avoid it if you're easily offended by tough women, gay characters or racial diversity.)

The trailer tells me that a girl broke with her boyfriend and is fighting because of... reasons?   If you make a Batman movie with the same story it would fail. Harley Quinn needs an origin story. Once character development is established for movie audiences you may do whatever you want.  This movie is like the middle episode filler which story no one asked for.  You may write a serious movie or a comedy. As long as you do your best to treat the movie seriously, it will be a good outcome. But a rerun of woke Charlie's Angels is certainly a writing failure.  Robbie said she would need to explore the character more. And I agree. Charlie's Angels is not exactly that.

But this god awful hair with the short bangs looks so stupid and we were intrigued by the fact she was a doctor turned criminal/mentally ill who fell in love with a psychopath while treating him in an asylum. Their relationship and the backstory was what people wanted to see more of that was barely touched in Suicide Squad. But this looks so disappointing in a thousand ways. Margot is beautiful but they actually managed to make her look not ugly but did everything they could to make her look like a 5 when she can look like a 10. Very bizarre whoever wrote put this crap together and managed to call it good and what people want to see. Seriously. Moronic. Was it a woman who threw this together? I really want to know.

2020-05-30T18:04:45,"Panem et circenses.    Harley Quinn, regardless of genre or medium, should be avant la lettre...   Get comfy and prepare for a lot of reading 🙂  I'll probably get voted down for this, but am I the only one who thinks she's way, WAY too old to be playing Harley these days???🤔 I'm not one for youth culture but since Harley fits with that, they should at least have an actress young enough to be believable.🤗 Disagree? Look at the posters and compare-the posters for the movie show Harley at her classic age, classic body.😊 lol    Elle est bonne in SS, but I (and others) considered that movie a spin-off of the traditional Harley/Joker universe. Robbie was vachement bien in it, portraying Harley in a different/modern light. But in this movie, it's like she's phoning it in, besides the appearance and form issues. In BoP, she's hardly sui generis. Besides her costumes and extreme makeup, she doesn't even stand out from the other actresses...Notice how they dressed-down the others to the point they actually blend in the background? TOTALLY wrong for any villain or hero. (At least when not in civilian mode.)    Robbies age shows in her face and body...not in a positive way.🤣 Unless they were going for an older/40 y.o. Harley.  Yes, I know Robbie is listed as ""29"" (Wikipedia is full of truth 😛), but we all know 8-10 years are subtracted from anyone's given age in Hollywood. Or used to be, probably more now since doc's can do so much more with plastic surgery techniques and advancements over the past few decades.🤯    She hasn't any waist unless she uses a corset (like in the Marilyn Monroe ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" scenes).😦 Harley always has a tiny waist, depending on which version impossibly small, but this woman doesn't have a waist (pause 1:07-1:08) at all!😮    She doesn't have a chest!😳 Harley does-granted, depending on what version not a large chest, but geez, something.😋 This to me isn't a big deal, however, since there are some versions with small chests...but not invisible.😜 Unless she wears a corset to help push things up (pause 1:08), you can't tell she has anything. And the chunky/muscle-y arms don't work with almost no chest.💁‍♀️    She does have lovely legs!😘 But they're smaller than her arms, and don't work with almost no butt. Flat butts are fine if you have a chest to balance it out, and for the character she should.🙂 Yes, Harley doesn't always have a regular sized butt in all versions, but it would help to even out Robbie's body.😑    Proportions are terribly off all over for Harley!😣😫 Sine qua non!😪    While we're on the area of pro forma, so let's move on to...    She's using her upper register at times for her voice, but her voice is naturally deeper.👀 Again, not like Harley's.🤐 And at times in this trailer I hear like a Brit accent ? And her version of east-coast (New York/New Jersey/PA) accent is downright *painful* to listen to.😭    *AND WHERE THE HELL IS IVY?*🤩 We all want Ivy to be in at least ONE movie.😆 (lol)   Also, Batgirl is missing (OMG, 🤦‍♂️) instead has been turned into an Asian kid who goes bad and becomes contract killer and PARTNERS with Harley? UGH.🙅‍♂️ What happened to superheros being good, and the triumph of good vs. evil???⚔☯ (What happened to) Protecting the innocent, omnia vincit amor, DECENCY, noblesse oblige, and righteous justice?⚜ It's what we all loved about the comic universe growing up, and most of us still do...
