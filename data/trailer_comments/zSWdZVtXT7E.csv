I know it's early but cinematography looks gorgeous, i was kind of skeptical since he's working with new DP in this one but Hoytema is more then a fine replacement, angles, colors... everything looks beautiful but let's not get ahead of our selves. I would love it if this is pretty much all the information we would get about this movie, i get that it's impossible since everyone depends on this one to be a hit (WB gave up two of their major franchise's just so they could get a cut of the cake, two major studios WB and Paramout are together in this, Legendary pic. bowed out of Man of Steel just so they can finance this one, how much this one earns will in my opinion define Nolan's future career since TDK films and Inception had all batman hype around it, if this one is indeed what Nolan claims it to be and is really that popular it would mean that Nolan is to stay and that more 'not so dumb but kind of emotionless' movies are on the way).

Interstellar travel is a fact of live and will happen eventually assuming our race evolves enough and the parameters of physics happen, due to the high likelihood that the ability of earth to sustain us as lifeforms will end. and while we may not know exactly how wormholes work in every facet, they do seem to be the best option in terms of interstellar travel out there due to the distances between solar systems being to great. this movie isn't silly, nor is it illogical based on the parameters it gives, its just exploring a thought path that we will probably explore one day. also as far as the food problem, that could very easily happen based on solar emission spectra changing in the slightest manner due to the core composition of our sun changing, so no it is not stupid, please stop talking as if you know everything in the field of astrophysics and biology, life isnt that simple.",0,0,Triageoftheear,zSWdZVtXT7E,0.15673484848484848,2014-06-17 01:25:08,True,True

People need to turn off the tv and look around, see the chemtrails they spray over head, that gives us all kinds of decease, the toxic GMO crops that sterilize men and women so by their third generation no one or 'other' life form will be able to reproduce. Then they will clone humans, shorten their lifespans and control them under a failed program of socialism, which doesn't work and the human race will disappear by the year 3000.

But, as a resident of this planet, I would love it if humanity would be less cruel to nature, and help maintain the balance of our ecosystem, by reducing pollution, violence, killing of animals. I am sure that no one will ever migrate to any other planet(Mars being the only option), because our body does not suit their atmosphere-if anyone goes on interplanetary travel, I am sure it will be a 1 way trip, and the whole world's population will never go, except astronauts & crazy billionaires.

Wormholes are still a theory, but, if it is found to exist, interstellar travel will be carried out by astronauts only; 7 billion(who knows, 14 billion in the future) will never go and colonize on Alpha Beta whatever new planet that's discovered; we shall perish anyway due to geological events, maybe a massive earthquake, too much pollution, poisonous radiation from space etc. So, my point is, space travel should only be in fiction, novels and movies, and whatever NASA is doing, at least for now. It would be much useful for Earth & humanity's survival, if we concentrate on eradicating diseases, inventing a cure for all incurable diseases, reducing pollution of air/water/sound/land/electronic waste/radioactive waste etc., finding alternate ways of harnessing pollution free energy, letting animals live, and reducing violence, and lastly, doing all the mentioned work on a major scale(not like, only 20 cars run on electricity and the rest use gas) because, if the Earth survives, we do too-and the longer we live, the longer we can experiment on space travel.

2014-08-02T10:07:04,Too early to judge but hope Nolan lives upto his name. As for the comments below The following -  Not so good movie but good screenplay Memento - Mindboggling. Credits to Nolan brothers.!! The prestige - one of the hallmark films in Hollywood. Nolan brothers does it again Batman Begins - the trendsetter showing the pain and personal life issues of Superheroes. U never saw that in any movie before. Lol Dark knight - one word...JOKER..everyone loved it for the evil mind of a criminal designed by Nolan of course. Plus the plot.!! Dark Knight rises - Good film as a whole. Didn't make an impact probably coz of the hype set by its predecessor The Inception - In my opinion the second best movie by Nolan. And Leonardo ..Just wow.!!

2014-11-01T04:38:54,"I'm afraid this will be another disappointing sci-fi movie, like Gravity. It will probably be filled with all sorts of misconceptions about space, even though Kip Thorne has been the scientific consultant for it (and also executive producer). Remember the movie ""Sunshine"" from 2007? Brian Cox was the scientific consultant for that one, and yet the movie was filled with all sorts of misconceptions and inaccuracies that made me laugh. And what about Gravity? That unknown force that pulled Clooney away from the ISS was a total joke, same for the orbital nonsense between the Hubble, the ISS and the Russian satellites, etc.  Just so you know, Interstellar tells the story of a group of astronauts who ""travel"" through a black hole...with hopes of going somewhere else and then return to Earth, that is. For all science knows, the laws of physics break down inside a black hole due to the tremendous gravitational pull, that means that we can't possibly know, through physics, what happens exactly to things that cross the ""event horizon"" (that's the edge of the black hole, so to speak).  All science can tell for sure is that when something crosses the event horizon, there's no turning back, if you somehow managed to come out, it wouldn't be alive and in one piece. When Hawking talks about how it is possible for information to be preserved inside a black hole, it just means INFORMATION, in other words, the particles that form your body could still be ""preserved"" somehow but you would die nonetheless, all your atoms would be undone, and that isn't pretty. Whoever tells you that you can travel through black holes (survive the journey and come back to the same universe as if nothing happened, that is), doesn't have the math/mechanism to support this claim and Kip Thorne knows it. I bet all Kip has done is to help model the black hole, give direction to actors who will play scientist roles and perhaps a few more things, but I'm pretty sure this movie will still contain nonsense. Sci-fi directors usually claim they've made sure everything is scientifically accurate, showing us stuff like this>  Interstellar – Building A Black Hole – Official Warner Bros. so people can say ""Oh! This time they've got it right!"" when, in reality, only some things are accurate, the rest is usually nonsense. Movies like Sunshine and Gravity are clear examples of this. Curiously, there is a 1968 movie called ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (perhaps you've heard about it, LOL) that gets most things right, without the need of using unlikely black hole travel, without the need to sell it for its ""realism"" or scientific accuracy, without flashy special effects, absurd amounts of money and without being too pretentious. The non-scientific parts of that movie are highly symbolic, which make it even better.  So Hollywood sci-fi movies nowadays have much larger budgets, a much higher availability of professionals from all branches, highly superior technology available, they generate much more money, etc. and yet they are worse every year... Why is that? I think it's because the essential guidelines of the business are wrong. They go for flashiness (big names, high numbers, extreme and flashy plots, etc.) instead of quality, they try to conciliate science with nonsensical extreme plots that are completely incompatible and absurd (my point being> don't try to sell the movie for its realism and accuracy if, in the end, it won't be so). This is the formula: big names + claims of scientific accuracy/realism + extreme plots filled with nonsense (the world is about to end, there's a critical accident/everything goes wrong, and the like) + stuff blowing up/getting destroyed + miraculous survivals + ultra hd cameras and all sorts of modern filters and effects + the hero saves the day (requiring his/her/their sacrifice, perhaps) = Next Hollywood sci-fi movie.",0,0,Goreuncle,zSWdZVtXT7E,0.031549707602339175,2014-11-01 04:38:54,False,True

Please come to Jesus Christ the Son of God now ! Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven has come near ! I'm telling you that this is the generation that will witness to the second coming of Jesus Christ on the earth... and that will take place immediately after a period of Great Tribulation of maximum 7 years that is about to start taking place all around the earth... I'm sure many of you heard about the New World Order... I'm telling you this is not a conspiracy theory... this is very real... and the New World Order is now proclaimed in many nations all around the world, and it is about to be launched at the global level... bringing a one world government and a one world economic system based on RFID Chips, and I'm telling you whoever takes that RFID Chip, even if he comes to repentance... he will never be able to receive the forgiveness of sins from God, and therefore he will burn in hell for eternity... therefore I'm telling you all... please come to Jesus Christ the Son of God now, do not delay repentance, for you do not know if you will reach home tonight, or if you will wake up in the morning... and therefore where will you reach then, or where will you wake up ? I'm telling you hell is so real, you just don't want to wake up there one day... but you also can't get to Heaven without Jesus Christ... I'm telling you, evolution is a devastating lie that came right from the mouth the devil... and religion that says that whoever simply believes in God... but does the will of the devil, and somehow he will be saved... is an absolute hypocrisy... Jesus Christ the Son of God said very clearly in John 14:6: ""I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."" I warn every single one of you here who reads this message, not because I so like to judge people and warn them, but because I want to tell you something very seriously, that you just don't realize how many traps the devil has placed for people at the global level... and he is desperately waiting to steal, kill, and destroy as many people as he will manage to... and the coming events... when they will start, it's going to be like an avalanche, when it will start, it will destroy everything in its way until it reaches the end... it's going to be overwhelming... I urge you to put your hope in Jesus Christ, He is the Son of God who came 2000 years ago, and taught people how to live right, moral, and holy in speech and acts, but many people did not want to listen to Him, and few were those who actually listened to Him, and took Him in serious, and followed Him... but the pharisees, the sadducees, and the scribes were the ones who were against Him, and wronged Him, and crucified Him, but because He was without sin, and because He was righteous, and holy in everything He said and did... even death could not stand against Him... He rose from the dead on the third day... being the Only True Savior for the human being, humanity, people... and He is coming very soon to judge the living and the dead... only those who truly believe in Him, not only by saying that they believe, but by living according to the faith, and living the way the Bible teaches that a true believer must live, only these people will be delivered from the Day of Judgement and from hell, and will be saved, and will be taken directly into the Kingdom of Heaven to live forever with Jesus Christ in the direct presence of God... I just want to tell you one more thing that I want you to understand very clearly, repentance is not a religious term, it is simply when man comes in his room alone, it does not have to be in front of some people or something... the man comes in his room alone, and comes in prayer to God in the Name of Jesus Christ, and simply prays this prayer: ""Lord Jesus, I know that You have died on that cross in my place, for my sins, and You rose from the dead on the third day, just to give me salvation Lord. Father please forgive me of my sins, and please save me from the Day of Judgement and from hell, and after death, please save me and take me directly in Your Kingdom God, I pray to you Father from Heaven, in the Name of Jesus Christ.

I know that it's with future technology, but a quicker escape velocity isn't an advantage. You'd just burn more fuel to achieve the same resoult. And why no fuel remnant at all? Where does the mass dissapear?  Compare to real rocket launch and the speed is *way* below that, while still having escape velocity. Taking E=mv² into account, that rocket's velocity would have been highly impractical. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsRuJ37kyZg  This is why I don't watch movies.

2015-01-01T13:58:07,"What an amazing movie! Well acted, well written and an amazing story/meaning. Nolan never fails to impress.  In advance. I want to say sorry for being THAT guy but I feel deeply offended by comments I see regarding religion :). If you are willing to listen to my opinion without spreading hate then click read more. I am happy to accept any of your RESPCTFUL arguments. :)         May I say that I do not study religion nor do I know a whole lot about others. I do however believe in God for various reasons. I am a Muslim so I am speaking in my religions point of view :). Many people may say that religion and science will never mix but I say and believe different. I would also like to clarify that there are also many things said in Islam (and other religions) that science cannot answer, therefore they are dismissed and considered inaccurate so I will not cover that (I'll leave it to the experts xD).   I just want to clear up that the Qur'an is historically proven to have been the oldest holy book that has been preserved and kept the same over 1400+ years (The time of it's revelation). What I'm saying here is that the Bible, Torah etc. were changed over time. That is a FACT.   Here is the most known example of science in the Qur'an. The birth of a human:   The miracle of man's creation is emphasised in many verses. Some of the information within these verses is so detailed that it was impossible for anyone living in the 7th century to have known it. Examples of these are as follows: 1. Man is not created from the entire semen, but only a very small portion of it (sperm). 2. It is the male that determines the sex of the baby. 3. The human embryo adheres to the mother's uterus like a leech. 4. The embryo develops in three dark regions in the uterus.   Let's pick out verses from the Qur'an that mention these.   1. Sperm undertake a journey into the mother's body until they reach the ovum. Only a thousand out of 250 million sperm succeed in reaching the ovum. At the end of this five-minute race, the ovum, half the size of a grain of salt, will let only one of the sperms in. That is, the substance of man is not the whole semen, but only a small part of it. This is explained in the Surat al-Qiyama as follows:   Does man reckon he will be left uncontrolled [without purpose]? Was he not once a drop of ejected semen? (Qur'an, 75:36-37)   2. Until fairly recently, it was thought that a baby's sex was determined by the mother's cells. Or at least, it was believed that the sex was determined by the male and female cells together. But, we are given different information in the Qur'an, where it is stated that masculinity or femininity is created out of ""a drop of sperm which has been ejected.""   He has created both sexes, male and female from a drop of semen which has been ejected. (Qur'an, 53:45-46)   Was he not a drop of ejaculated sperm, then a blood-clot which He created and shaped, making from it both sexes, male and female? (Qur'an, 75:37-39)   The developing disciplines of genetics and molecular biology have scientifically validated the accuracy of this information given by the Qur'an. It is now understood that sex is determined by the sperm cells from the male, and that the female has no role in this process.   The Qur'an even talks about the development of a foetus!   [We] then formed the drop into a clot and formed the clot into a lump and formed the lump into bones and clothed the bones in flesh; and then brought him into being as another creature. Blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators! (Qur'an, 23:14)   (All Information above is taken from http://miraclesofthequran.com/scientific_57.html)   Now to Stephen Hawking's theory.   In the Qur'an, which was revealed fourteen centuries ago at a time when the science of astronomy was still primitive, the expansion of the universe was described in the following terms:   And it is We Who have constructed the heaven with might, and verily, it is We Who are steadily expanding it. (Qur'an, 51:47)   The word ""heaven,"" as stated in the verse above, is used in various places in the Qur'an. It is referring to space and the wider universe. Here again, the word is used with this meaning, stating that the universe ""expands."" The Arabic word ""moosiaaoona"" in the term ""inna lamoosiaaoona,"" translated into English as ""it is We Who are steadily expanding it"", comes from the verb ""evsea,"" meaning ""to expand."" The prefix ""la"" emphasises the following name or title and adds a sense of ""to a great extent."" This expression therefore means ""We expand the sky or the universe to a great extent."" This is the very conclusion that science has reached today.   All this was known to Muhammad (Peace be upon him) 15 hundred years ago! All things we have recently discovered.   Please take in mind that I am 13 (14 soon) I am not just a Muslim because I was born into it. I am a Muslim because I believe what it teaches is right! Not the BS you see in the media (ISIS, Al Qaeda etc.)   I would also like to say that I respect all of your opinions and I thank you for listening to mine :)   Have a great day!",1,0,Mahdi Chowdhury,zSWdZVtXT7E,0.141017316017316,2015-01-01 13:58:07,False,True

2015-03-23T05:19:53,"Here's my take. A valiant attempt to take on a big block buster sci-fi movie about quantum physics and deep human themes of love and humanity. However, I think Nolan bit off more than he could chew with this one. After viewing, I kept thinking this film was over indulgent in nearly every way. The characters were weak, plot rushed (terrible flow), overly melodramatic, and ultimately disappointing in its scope. What he lacked in those key areas he tried to make up with state of the art special effects and a suffocation of scientific information (there's nothing wrong with that in general but it's just foolish to try and cram that level of cosmology and quantum physics education into a 3 hour mainstream movie). To me, Nolan is like the Starbucks of film making; on the surface his style and choice of themes seem intellectual and authentic. However, under that surface is just a watered down, massed produced corporate product under the guise of quality. I don't think this is a masterpiece in the same way ""2001"" or ""Alien"" were. Just like the album ""The Wall"" by Pink Floyd or the film ""Apocalypse Now"" by Francis Ford Coppola, this movie aimed way too high without hitting the mark.",1,0,John Owens,zSWdZVtXT7E,-0.02444822373393801,2015-03-23 05:19:53,False,False

I use to think my grandfather's workshop must have been what Einstein's laboratory must have looked like as I was amazed at the things my grandfather could do. This is a movie that I think they would all love. This is a movie I have been waiting a long time for!

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.  Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

I keep pondering on the myriad of themes and stunning visual, the Black hole, Millers planet, Manns planet, the Tesseract, Bulk beings... I was sorry they did not show Edmund's planet (at all).  One clarification for viewers,Cooper is trapped in Tesseract which is a 5 dimensional space,(Tiper's Paradise) this allows him to be in all time in all places simultaneously,he can choose where he wants to see(??how) but cannot communicate because he is beyond event horizon of a black hole. In the end he can leave the tesseract and enter a universe that is ready to receive him (maybe created for him at the instant of collapse of tesseract).
