First the person in the book/movie in Argentina whose love one was raped and murdered was the husband and not the mother of the victim not the co-worker of the detective, secondly Isidro Gomez didn't have a criminal record and kept a low profile after he discovered that the cops were looking for him. He wasn't found by looking through a list of people who had been in jail but by following what he written which was his passions. Also time passes in which the shocking reveal at the end of the movie(which I won't give away for those that might want to check it out) I don't see how they could accomplish a time change with this.
