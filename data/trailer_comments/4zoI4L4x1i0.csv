You can't judge a movie just by a trailer. Now I respect everyone's opinion, but Steve was TIRED! He was trying to get used the animation, and so after the first movie, he wanted to take a brake, so he offered it to his friend that worked on the show with him, Paul Tibbit, and Steve didn't leave or quit making Spongebob, he's still on the show and request some episode now and then too. All I'm saying is stop trashing the New episodes of Spongebob and BADGERING Steve to get back on the show, he said he would like to get back on the show after this movie, So chill out! People keep complaining and saying ""they should just cancel Spongebob already!"" But then we got that rumor that said Spongebob was gonna get cancel, and EVERYONE started freaking out, so don't go crying when it does get cancel, because it'll be you'll fault for trashing it all the time, and all the TRUE fans that love and support the writers and the show will be crying because there favorite show will be cancelled.

I'm not crazy about the first movie and show as I used to be, but at least the first movie had a plot that seemed to have more focus and had an intimidating threat (Alec Baldwin was great as Dennis) and took more risks with the story such as the whole ""Plankton using slavery to take over Bikini Bottom to get his ways"".

An old cartoon cherished by all reborn to a new generation thanks to the creative genius of the guy who left after the Spongebob Movie.
