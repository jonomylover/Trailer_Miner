It's a big financial gamble if the studios were to invest in something new. If a producer or director were to approach the studios with an original story, then they, along with many other people, are at risk of losing their job. Why do you think a lot of studios are now taking the safe route by spawning out remakes and reboots? They know that people who are familiar with these stories will pay to see it. It's show business. Besides, there have been a large number of original films out there, but they're either unheard of, or they didn't do so well.

Cinderella is a classic in film-making and animation, and although some would argue that you cannot replicate the timeless film, I believe a live-action version would not retract from the film, but almost deliver the Cinderella story to today's generation of children. I'm intrigued by this film and what it may offer. Disney has been making many live action films like Alice in Wonderland and Maleficent, and they have not disappointed. However I believe what made those films stand out is that they told the story from a different perspective, or offered a spin on the original storyline.

Cinderella wore her hair up and she was not that damn skinny. She also looked more plumped with with beauty. Now this girl is lovely but no Cinderella, I also didn't see the prince with long hair. I swear Hollywood makes me sick. The Brandy version will still be my favorite because they did it different with different races of people. But this one tried to be like the cartoon version and failed. That dress she wore to the ball looks like the same dress she had on when she ripped her sleeve, except more material.

Already hearing the memorable lines, ""Where there is kindness there is goodness, where there is goodness there is magic"" & the parts where Cinderella's Mom tells her that her daughter has more kindness in her little finger than most people have in their whole bodies, & for her to always remember to have kindness & courage, yeah, I got misty eyed, there. :-) I did like ""Maleficent"". I need to buy that DVD soon. But yeah, I'm liking the live action Disney films. I did like the ""Oz"", ""Alice in Wonderland"" films. And I heard from others that there were will be ""Beauty & the Beast"", ""The Jungle Book"" - even though there is ""Jungle Book"" film already out there with Jason Scott Lee, ""The Little Mermaid"", & ""Dumbo"". There are two different versions of live action ""Snow White"".  Regarding the Cinderella story, there are some decent films out there with live human actors playing Cinderella role - ""Ever After"" with Drew Barrymore - I think that was my favorite ""Cinderella"" movie because Drew Barrymore's character was an empowered, strong, able to save other people & fend for herself Cinderella & there are the ""A Cinderella Story"" movies - three of them - with Hilary Duff, Selena Gomez, & Lucy Hale playing the leads in each of those three films. Back to this ""Cinderella"" film - I think it will be good to see Lily James (I like watching her on ""Downton Abbey"" TV series, Cate Blanchett, & Helena Bonham Carter.

2015-03-08T06:17:32,"Cinderella came out as a disney movie in 1950. It was one of the most popular youngs girl movies for forty years, straight through to the 90's. Now... cinderella has been replaced by ""frozen"" ""tangled"" aNd ""brave"". All movies about female potential and strength. So... in my opinion... i think that this movie is being rereleased, because the girls who grew up watching cinderella are now mothers themselves, but theres a more mature component to it because its not a cartoon, and im sure there will be much more female strength in this movie than just crying because you dont have a prince. So.... in other words... not only will little girls want to see it, but the girls mothers, and sad lonely single women will want to go see it too, meaning if you were a girl born between 1950-now, youll be a potential viewer.
