Apparently, since you morons aren't getting a paycheck for your dumb thinking and whining, you get jealous over people who are taking risks and doing something in life they more than likely enjoy to do at the expense of many cynicism from retarded morons like you whiners commenting on this video, simply because people like Peter Jackson and others, desire to make movies to entertain you stupid crybaby people!

Seems way too childish and not a great pre-qual to LOTR at all. Its like watching Star Wars The Phantom Menace. Please take away all the childish play and make this once again about a serious journey. Its just so sad the way this trilogy lowered its standards to make it child friendly. Rolling through the cave like a pinball knocking down orcs, and never showing any blood was really fake in every way. This is fantasy yes but don't change the physics law with it too. The barrel scene was a copy of the cave scene from the first movie and once again defied all physics of nature. I was like Oh boy here we go again. Something to make the kids laugh with joy. Theres no heart in the Hobbit, everyones acting but theres no fear or love or danger. Its just a bunch of laughs for the kids...I know alot of you may disagree and thats fine, I'm just giving my opinion. Yes I will be watching it but only becouse each movie the director made promises and promises so far he didn't keep. Maybe the third times the charm.

2014-07-28T21:55:09,"Wow, just like the actual fans guessed, Galadriel and everyone is coming to help Gandalf at Dol Goldur. We must be psychic... Oh wait, we just know the full story. Contrary to what the haters who ""read the book"" whine about, the events at Dol Goldur are following Tolkien's canon. This is exactly what happened when Gandalf left the dwarves. There's going to be a big battle between Sauron and the White Council, and it's going to be fucking epic.  As for the other complaints, it makes sense for Legolas to be there. He's the prince of Mirkwood and was alive at the time. There's nothing wrong with bringing back a member of the Fellowship of the Ring just for a little throwback.  And while Azog should be dead at the time and it would have been more faithful to the story to have Bolg after them, both are fucking cool and I can't say I see any problem with giving both of them some good screen time, since this is the last time we're going to see them.  As for the Kili and Tauriel romance. I haven't read the books for a long time, but I believe Kili dies anyways. It's only fair that he gets his doodle dipped before he shits the bed lmao.  Change can be bad, but it can also be a good thing. So long as they follow the story, I don't see why there's anything wrong with also adding to the story while they do so. The long sequence of Smaug chasing the dwarves through the tunnels never happend in the books, but did it really change anything? No, it was an addition that one could snip out in Windows Movie Maker and pretend never existed if they really hated it so much. Personally, ever since I was a kid, I wanted Bilbo to be the one to kill Smaug. He's supposed to be the hero after all. I was so excited in the theater when I saw him and the dwarves taking him on. Sure they didn't kill him, and I'm glad they didn't as it would have strayed too far and would have prevented the Battle of Five armies, but it was great to have that closure.  All I can say is, if people are hating these movies so much, they can just not watch one, complain about it, watch the next and complain about it, then watch the 3rd and complain about it. This kind of stupidity just kills it for people who are enjoying the ride.",0,0,igetboredproductions,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.10386904761904764,2014-07-28 21:55:09,True,True

I loved PJ's LOTR, because he stayed close to the source material (with a few notable exceptions that made it worse). We don't need a fucking love story, during every movie. There's no point in the love triangle he created during the last movie. It serves no story function, except to keep a character relevent that isn't supposed to be there in the first place (can you tell I'm sick of Legolas yet?).   The thing is Legolas is a badass. He's a great character, but this isn't his story. He deserved a brief cameo at most (similar to Frodo). Adding him is like adding hot fudge to a hot dog. It might be great, but it ruins both foods involved.   Why he now thinks changing everything will make it better is beyond me.

Before You guys start bitching as always about how he ruined the movie,only because You know The Hobbit book has 300 pages,and that's all You know,and You don't know that Tokien wrote adaptations in Lotr what was happening in The Hobbit,but it is not int he book,please read this. No one can't compare book with movies,it is all about style of writing. Tolkien in The Hobbit didn't described so detail places like in Lotr,but there are a lot of important scenes in that one small book,like: Troll Shaws,Rivendell,Goblin cave,whenthey escaped on trees,Beorn's house,Mirkwood,Barrel escape (which I prefer movie style),LakeTown,Erebor,Battle of the five armies,and Back to Bag-End. There are also things what are not in The Hobbit book,like Dol-Guldur,but those things are explained in Lotr books,what were happening at the time of The Hobbit,but it is not in The Hobbit book,but PJ also included that in Movies,so tell me,how would You include all of these scenes in only 1 or 2 movies? Some explanations why Legolas is in the movie:The Hobbit movie is not based on The Hobbit book,it is based on The Hobbit book + scripts at the end of Lotr book what has some things what were happening at the time at The Hobbit book,but these things are not in The Hobbit book.Tolkien wnted to re-write The Hobbit after Lotr,to fit it in nicely,but he died.Legolas lives at the time of The Hobbit book,cause he is Thranduil's son,and elves can't die by natural death.So, how would You explain if Legolas is not in the movie? Where is he then?  I am a huge Tolkien and PJ fan,but there is only 1 thing I didn't like in the movies: Tooooo big role for Legolas, I like the fact that he is included in movies,but I would keep him inside of Mirkwood,it was toooo big role for him (since he isn't in the book) when he fought with Bolg.Barrel escape was biggest (positive) surprise,and I would finish with Legolas there.And about the title,There and Back Again is kind of title for a whole trilogy,not only last movie,so I understand the reason of changing the title. Peter Jackson did soooo much for us,if You guys want to complain about every single detail,then why are You watching this,why You waste Your ''important time'' on writing how he wants only the money? When You see his production blogs,You will see that he does that because he loves his fans,and because he loves his job. I don't think he gets money for production blogs.He did soooo much for fans,as no one director did before. I would give anything to win Contest for premiere.

2014-07-29T02:04:30,"For all of you squabbling about the movies and how they were made:  First of all, no movie will ever be EXACTLY like the book. Quite literally its impossible, but even more importantly is something called ""adaptation to film"". Taking a story in a book, and translating it into a film is a lot more complicated and tedious than you might think. There needs to be certain aspects within a film in order to keep it both engaging and entertaining. I think Peter did a fantastic job with the extra details in the movies that weren't in the book. They were subtle, intriguing, and in no way did they alter or take away from the original story. For those who might not have read the books, some examples of things in The Hobbit Trilogy that was not in the books would be Azog (dont get me wrong, hes in the books...just not like in the movies), Tauriel and Legolas, and not to mention Tauriel and Kili's love relationship. While these things weren't in the books (or at least changed from the books), what it did give us was a feared villain (Azog), some familiar faces which regular viewers can relate to (Legolas) and a compelling and complicated love story (Tauriel and Kili). If you took away those things, sure it would be ""more true to the book"", but it would make for a rather boring movie...don't you think?  And secondly, for all of you complaining about how they weren't filmed like the original LOTR films....its been 10 years!!!!!!! Are you really that shocked? Yes, there's more CGI. Yes, the appearance looks different. But guess what? Its better. Complaining that these movies aren't like the original trilogy is like saying ""Oh yea, I guess the Galaxy S5 is a pretty sweet phone and all, but I dont understand why they didnt make it more like my awesome flip phone brick I had back in 2001"" If Peter had made the original trilogy in 2014, they'd be made EXACTLY like The Hobbit was.",0,0,Urban Digital Photography,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.1724252491694352,2014-07-29 02:04:30,True,True

Of course, critics will praise parts and themes of the movie, but certain aspects are needed to drive the storyline. I say this to help future projects.....I may not be a master of all film, but I must say, the trailer shows that the movie won't be as fulfilling in iconic and filming matters but a visual treat. Thank you though, and I hope to see this film in the future release.

2014-07-29T04:55:50,"For those of you STILL complaining about how unlike the books these are and how there are three movies, let me point out a few things:  1) You have had over THREE YEARS to wrap your head around it. You have known it would be THREE MOVIES since BEFORE the first movie came out! Get over it, already.  2) The Hobbit was written very differently from LOTR, in that events were much more generalized and characters far less developed. Almost the entire distance of their journey in The Hobbit is the same length as LOTR, and almost as many events occurred, but Tolkien didn't go into as much detail because it was meant for a younger readership. You can't generalize stuff like that in a movie, characters and situations have to be fleshed out.  3) Tolkien was going to greatly expand The Hobbit by re-writing it in the style of LOTR, only to be discouraged by his peers and family. Had he gotten his way, The Hobbit would probably be more like these movies.  4) A lot of the Appendices that take place in the same time as the book have been incorporated into the book (particularly how Gandalf plays a larger role in the greater scheme of events).   5) If you listen to ""The Tolkien Professor"" podcast (highly recommended to all Tolkien fans) the host, Dr. Corey Olsen, a PhD in Medieval literature, explains that in many ways a great story only becomes greater when it is retold again and again in different ways. He explains during the days of Shakespeare (who is often himself accused of being a plagiarist), a story wasn't even considered for greatness unless it was a retelling of some earlier version. This is just a modern version of that very thing happening.  6) Tolkien openly wrote in a letter that him writing The Hobbit as a simple fairy tale story was a mistake and a reflection of his ""lowered"" skill in writing at the time and, had it been later, he would have written in a much more mature tone.  7) If you want something just like the book...read the book! What's the point of going to the movie if it's going to be the exact same story in the exact same tone as what you have already experienced? I'm excited to see this because even though I've read the book times beyond count, I'm STILL in suspense about how this will all wrap up and how the MOVIE Hobbit will tie in with the MOVIE Lord of the Rings.  8) When necessary, there are elements that are DEAD ON with the books, especially in all the most iconic moments. The ""Good Morning"" scene in the first film was absolutely perfect, Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman are perfect in their respective roles, the Riddles In the Dark scene came right out of the book, and Bilbo meeting Smaug played out exactly as well as we all had hoped.",0,0,MrBG1138,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.23348544973544974,2014-07-29 04:55:50,True,True

All you who say people who complain about the hobbit being made into 3 movies, i don't think you actually read the lord of the rings books. There was so much cut out of those books and new stuff put in, but we loved it anyway. The major themes and scenes from the hobbit are still in the movie as well as the general story line. Add ins is what makes it original. A film cant be exactly like the book they need to re-imagine it. So to all those Tolkien purists who have nothing better to do than compare the book to the movie are truly moronic for doing so.

2014-07-29T12:02:42,"It is ridiculous! The Bashing on Hobbit became so in, that even people knowing nothing are on it now.  1. Black arrow was in the books, movies changed it into balista projectile since regular arrow wouldn't even scratch movie Smaug (hole in armor or not).  2. The Battle of Five Armies WAS in the bloody book. But since the Hobbit was written as children story, Bilbo gets knocked out and wakes up to see the aftermath.  3. The attack on Dol Guldur is based on Tolkien's stories as well. Al beit, in book version Sauron runs from the White Council, unable to make stand (pissed of Galadriel is sight to see). Later, during War of the Ring, the Dol Guldur was used as base for one of the Nine who led Mordor's proxy armies against Elves and Dwarves of the region to make sure they can't come to assist when main force sieges Minas Tirith. After their defeat Galadriel destroys the fortress, leaving only dust.  4. Presence of Legolas is more than justified. He is the son of king, member of royal court and high-level commander. When Hobbit was written not even Tolkien knew that in the future there will be Legolas. If he did, the character would be written into the story. Thanks to the ""wide"" description of elven feasts, not focusing on individuals, one can asume that Legolas was indeed present.  5. Apart from making up Evangeline Lily's character (which was done VERY respectfully towards Tolkien's body of work) is every added scene or storyline based on the original stories. Instead of Focusing on Bilbo's trip, it tells the story of where Gandalf always disapeared to, shows us the politics and background of all the involved factions and races.  6. To people complaining they made three movies out of 300page book: There is this tiny thing. Tolkien isn't such a big literary name just for kicks. The Hobbit was written as children story and after expanded into LotR trilogy, but even as such, the original book is dense. Beyond dense. There is more happening on those 300pages than some authors manage to squish into a thousand. You couldn't make A-class Hollywood movie out of it if it was to be just one film. Well, you could, but it would be beyond stupid.  ""Hey, Gandalf, we need you.""  ""Tough luck, see ya!"" and the grey dude disapears without single explanation why or where and when they don't need him he returns to disapear again when he is needed.  Or how would you explain why elves are in the battle? Where did the orcs came from? Why is this all happening? Wait, what is Beorn doing in the battle? Wait, wasn't there just thirteen of those little pricks? Where did the other 500 came from?  Noone but the book reader would know what is happening and sometimes not even that, because as I observe, even lot of those who read the book have no idea what it is about.  Coming of Smaug was Sauron's plan to get rid of the mightiest freefolk kingdom in this part of the Middleearth. Hasted attempt —after dragon's death— to conquere the Mountain before dwarves settle in was the first step in the War of the Ring.  Sauron planned and schemed for long time beofre LotR.  Hobbit trilogy should finish the puzzle, making it hexalogy of awesome. From the resurfacing of the One Ring to its demise in the fires of mount Doom.  Peace out, captain beams out. ",0,0,Arrynek01,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.013236961451247151,2014-07-29 12:02:42,True,True

Why the hell could not Smaug's destruction of Lake Town and his end been the finale of Film 2 instead of the CGI dwarven olympic games? There's plenty with the Arkenstone, armies, relations etc for a full film. This trailer shows Lake Town already destroyed. Not that we didn't know it was coming, but, damn, totally takes the excitement out of seeing what the dragon will do.  Jackson bungled the Hobbit. Not entirely, there's a lot to like, but this trailer does not get me excited in the least. There's nothing really there to make me want to see it. If the previous films had less CGI crap and more of the book like, say, Beorn or Mirkwood, perhaps Smaug could have been saved for the final film.  End Film 2 with opening the hidden door.

2014-07-29T14:35:04,"The only reason I am disappointed about the movies is their unneccesary sillyness. I loved the cameos, I loved the dwarf song, I loved the slow pacing, I loved the music. I didn't mind them seperating it into three parts and adding more simarillion scenes to it. The more I get to see of Middle Earth the better. But honestly, I was looking forward to meet characters like Radagast. I did not imagine him tripping on magic mushrooms or riding a sledge pulled by rabbits. I am sorry, but that is nothing that belongs to Lord of the Rings nor to a story for children (well, maybe the rabbit part, but the shroom part definitly not). I didn't expect it to be as epic or serious as Lord of the Rings - but I also didnt expect to see a goblin king loosing his head all disney like, waiting for him to realize he is dead before his head falls off and stuff like that. If this wasn't the Lord of the Rings franchise, and instead some disney movie, this would have been awesome. But now I feel like they took some of my most beloved characters and turned them into jokes. And that really pulls be out of the movie's atmosphere and makes me dislike the trilogy.",0,0,Crozyr,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.276984126984127,2014-07-29 14:35:04,True,True

2014-07-29T16:16:38,"Peter Jackson is best living man on Earth!!!! Before You guys start bitching as always about how he ruined the movie,only because You know The Hobbit book has 300 pages,and that's all You know,and You don't know that Tokien wrote adaptations in Lotr what was happening in The Hobbit,but it is not int he book,please read this. No one can't compare book with movies,it is all about style of writing. Tolkien in The Hobbit didn't described so detail places like in Lotr,but there are a lot of important scenes in that one small book,like: Troll Shaws,Rivendell,Goblin cave,whenthey escaped on trees,Beorn's house,Mirkwood,Barrel escape (which I prefer movie style),LakeTown,Erebor,Battle of the five armies,and Back to Bag-End. There are also things what are not in The Hobbit book,like Dol-Guldur,but those things are explained in Lotr books,what were happening at the time of The Hobbit,but it is not in The Hobbit book,but PJ also included that in Movies,so tell me,how would You include all of these scenes in only 1 or 2 movies? Some explanations why Legolas is in the movie:The Hobbit movie is not based on The Hobbit book,it is based on The Hobbit book + scripts at the end of Lotr book what has some things what were happening at the time at The Hobbit book,but these things are not in The Hobbit book.Tolkien wnted to re-write The Hobbit after Lotr,to fit it in nicely,but he died.Legolas lives at the time of The Hobbit book,cause he is Thranduil's son,and elves can't die by natural death.So, how would You explain if Legolas is not in the movie? Where is he then?  I am a huge Tolkien and PJ fan,but there is only 1 thing I didn't like in the movies: Tooooo big role for Legolas,if You read my previous post,I like the fact that he is included in movies,but I would keep him inside of Mirkwood,it was toooo big role for him (since he isn't in the book) when he fought with Bolg.Barrel escape was biggest (positive) surprise,and I would finish with Legolas there.And about the title,There and Back Again is kind of title for a whole trilogy,not only last movie,so I understand the reason of changin the title. Peter Jackson did soooo much for us,if You guys want to complain about every single detail,then wgy ara You watching this,why You waste Your ''important time'' on writing how he wants only the money? When You see his production blogs,You will see that he does that because he loves his fans,and because he loves his job. I don't think he gets money for production blogs.He did soooo much for fans,as no one director did before. I would give anything to win Contest for premiere. PJ,You changed my life forever with Your movies,I hope I will become movie director at least 5% like You are now.﻿",15,4,Darkness1984,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.15330286996953665,2014-07-29 16:16:38,True,True

2014-07-29T21:29:20,"People bashing on the Hobbit series not being nearly as ""epic"" as the LOTR series need to realize that the two stories told have completely different tones, and circumstances.   The Hobbit, is a story about the reclamation of Erebor and the riches within, citing Smaug as the main villain. In a story mainly comprised of Dwarves, a bumbling wizard, and a bookish Hobbit, it can expected that the tone of the piece will be a much more lighthearted version, with more blooming colors, jovial music, and goofy characters (like the book, and the old 1950's cartoon). In essence the Hobbit characterizes the life-changing adventure of the main character in an isolated story that has no repercussions throughout Middle Earth, and only involves a small portion of it.   Meanwhile, the LOTR trilogy encompasses a much darker feeling of foreboding, war, and struggle. This, coupled with its serious tone (as it involves the entirety of Middle Earth hanging in the balance) creates a more highborn and serious cinematic experience. Colors are refined, clothing is either armor or dull colored garments (excluding elves), the tone set by the situation and the actors leads to a much more ""epic"" feeling of the all-out struggle for survival, as the characters embark on the epic, and much more dangerous quest to save Middle Earth.  In the end people are confusing two similar but different subgenre's concerning these two series'. The high-spirited, and somewhat goofy adventure fantasy the Hobbit is, is being wrongly compared to the dark adventure fantasy that the LOTR trilogy is. All in all, Tolkien had two very different tones for each series' and each movie needs to be portrayed differently as such.",0,0,RunningInCircles222,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.05122549019607843,2014-07-29 21:29:20,True,True

I'm not saying I do not like them to date, but they have strayed off course from the book in order to stretch this into 3 movies when one longer movie would have probably sufficed.

2014-07-29T23:27:55,"I was incredibly disappointed by the Hobbit movies.  They've shown no respect for the source material and have pulled all sort of cheap, and lazy tricks to try to get people into the theaters.  The big one is that they made 3 movies out of a book no bigger than any one volume of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, each of which only got a single movie.  You can't justify it with the bits from Tolkeins other works, because he said himself, that he didn't go into them because they weren't part of THIS story.  Worse than that is the mandatory unredeemably stupid scene they've put into each Hobbit movie.  In the first one it was the bridge ""surfing"" that destroyed any semblance of realism this world had, as apparently Goblin bridges have advanced stabilizers and super-filaments to keep them together as they act like a raft on a water slide.  The second movie's scene was the escape from the elves in barrels.  The books had a clean escape with the Dwarves sealed and Bilbo riding the last one invisible.  The scene is summed up best when a dwarf pokes his arms and legs out of the barrel, gets weapons from nowhere, fights a bunch of Orks, and then the barrel is magically intact when he jumps back into the river.  The third movie's stupid scene looks like it will have something to do with that wagon.  But worst of all, in the second movie, the introduction of the she-elf (not in the book anywhere) with the crush on Legolas (who played no role in the book), plays out as a self insert fan-fiction from a preteen girl.  The stupid ""love triangle"" just plays off other movies from lesser source material.  *Note:  I like Pippin's song, but there were plenty of songs from The Hobbit, and putting that one in here was just lazy.",15,8,Lennard Church,ZSzeFFsKEt4,-0.06802721088435372,2014-07-29 23:27:55,True,True

He's done the same thing to The Hobbit! Worse yet, he's turned this simple story of a bunch of dwarves and a burglar into a mini series. The galling part is that someone is making a p'pot full of money on one of the best told stories ever written. C'mon you Tolkien descendants that have control of the copyright! It's time to speak up. BTW, I've read the Rings story 0ver 5 times and the Hobbit 3. What happened to Tom Bombadil and the enchanted forest and the barrow downs where the Hobbits got their magical swords??

They're still fantastic films, though... just not ""The Lord of the Rings"" fantastic.

As for my predictions, I think Azog is either killed by Thorin or Beorn, just after severely wounding Thorin, especially since Thorin got a gigantic mace to the face in AUJ, as for Fili and Kili, the Tauriel romance may have an influence, Bolg might kill them and Legolas will finally finish off Bolg like they started in DOS.

2014-08-01T15:22:23," These movies, including lotr ARE childish. Face the facts, the stories don't show the pain of adult life, the temptations and conflicts that responsible adults REALLY face, nor is it realistic. But they sometimes portray intense moments that are climatic, with scenes of decision making, facing challenges, breakdown etc....so it sets a great moral and message with its literature at the end of the day.  So as a young adult, despite of what I said, I LOVE IT. But if someone finds it too fantasy-like and doesn't like the films (even lotr), I doesn't disagree with you one bit. But if an adult likes it and understands it, why not? Die hard fans should not bash at  people who don't find these interesting, because fantasy is too subjective, and fans are immature if they disagree with the haters of the series.  But as a film and literature maniac, I LOVED it. For its intense suspense, great morals and messages, and brilliant character portrayals, references and judgements. Great work by Tolkien and Jackson!﻿",2,0,Hermann Schloffer von Graz,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.30921052631578955,2014-08-01 15:22:23,True,True

Though only PJ knows what his premise was, I think this song is like one of those ""links"" to past events. So, when Pipin sings this song for Denethor in LOTR, he is in a way being critical of his decision to send Faramir to his death, by reminding him of old war (in this case battle of five armies) and how a lot was lost in pursuit of one man's lust for power (Thorin in this case, but many others too, and of course Denethor himself). This in some way is also an attempt to start to start building the stage for LOTR events just like the other prequel trilogies have done.

2014-08-03T12:19:57,"Rough sketch of upcoming events:      The siege of Dol Guldur happens first. Gandalf, Galadriel and her elves destroy the fortress. Sauron is thought dead (he isn't :P). (This was not actually in the Hobbit books, but considering where the story is going, it must happen in the movie.)     Bard manages to kill Smaug with the black arrow, but Smaug crashes into the town, sinking it.     Esgaroth (Laketown) is ruined after Smaug's demise. Since the men killed the dragon of Erebor, and the prophecy promised rivers filled with gold, they plan to get their share of the treasures.     The elves follow the dwarves and come across the ruined Laketown. They help the survivors and join them as they also want a share of the treasures. I don't know why, they didn't help against Smaug. Maybe some old debts.     Thorin's company is searching for the Arkenstone but can't find it. They realise the elves and men are coming and they prepare the defenses of Erebor. Thorin refuses to give the men and elves anything. They send for reinforcements from a cousin of Thorin (Dáin II of Ironfoot), saying Smaug is dead and they need help to defend Erebor. (The dwarves had talking birds in the books that made communication easier.)     Bilbo secretly takes the Arkenstone, that is why the dwarves can't find it. (In the books he didn't know what it was and planned to keep it as his share and when Thorin said he would kill anyone who was hiding it he was afraid to reveal it.) In the movie he will probably keep it from Thorin as Smaug told him it would be Thorin's downfall and he saw how crazy Thorin was about the stone.     There was a long standoff between the elves/men and dwarves at the gates of Erebor. The elves/men were reluctant to siege Erebor but wanted their share of treasures. Bilbo secretly sneaked out and met with Thranduil. He gave the Arkenstone to him, saying that Thorin must negotiate with them once he shows him the stone.     When this happened, Thorin was enraged how the elves got it. Bilbo revealed he did it. Thorin cursed him and chased him from Erebor. Thorin still refused to give the elves/men what they wanted.     The dwarven army appeared and a battle started. It wasn't very detailed in the books, but the goblins arrived in the middle of the battle to destroy all. It turned out that Gandalf was among the elves all along (after Dol Guldur) and Beorn and the eagles also hepled. The dwarves, men and elves reluctantly joined sides against the goblins.     Thorin fough against Bolg (Azog was long dead) and he was mortally wounded. Kili and Fili died to protect his body. Beorn killed Bolg.     After the battle a dying Thorin apologised to Bilbo then died. His body was placed in the tombs with the Arkenstone on his chest, along with Fili and Kili. His cousin (the one who brought the army) became King Under the Mountain. The elves and men got what they wanted. Everyone was happy and the journey back to the Shire was uneventful. Bilbo got his share of treasures and became a rich hobbit.  By the way, the ""orcs"" in the book are the ""goblins"" whose leader Gandalf killed in goblin town. They, and all the other goblin tribes, come for revenge, led by Bolg (goblin son of goblin Azog) and a bunch of bats. Orcs, goblin, whatever you call them, the guys in the upcoming battle are the underground guys of the mountains and not Sauron's army. Sauron's army in Dol Guldur is already destroyed by the time of the Battle of Five Armies.",5,1,Bindair Dundat,ZSzeFFsKEt4,-0.03320987654320987,2014-08-03 12:19:57,True,True

Maybe not in theater, but whatever. Still I get a creepy feeling that he's going to somehow break the somber mood and turn the final battle scene into a circus with his elfish acrobats, just like he did in Return of the King. Thankfully in that case he at least had the judgment to put all of the silliness AFTER the ride of the Rohirrim and Theoden's last charge. Otherwise it would have been ruined. Honestly, I dreaded hearing that Orlando Bloom was appearing in the Hobbit movies, and my fears were fully vindicated by the idiotic stunts and CG acrobatics, and the corny-as-fuck love triangle subplot. It was more like a fan-fiction than a real portrayal of Tolkien's work.

I watched the 2nd one since im a fan and I HAD to. If people are saying its 2014 then y does the walking dead not use CGI for the zombies?? Infact they have to prepare zombies for every episode which takes hell of an effort. The hobbit series just has 3 movies. If i had watched the hobbit before the LOTR my opinion would be different.

2014-08-05T18:36:48,"Despite the trilogies haters and dislikers and people who don't like the changes from the book, (whom I respect their opinions) I have so far liked this trilogy far more than I thought I would. The Hobbit when I read it felt like a taste tester for LOTR and I never gave it much thought as LOTR was the more impressive, big brother. I never thought that anyone could bring it to the big screen and make it enjoyable. But for me Jackson did (or at least so far). I think a lot of people assumed that Smaug would die at the end of the last film and thus making the third very short, I sure did. But then I thought about what would be in this film and actually theres enough material to make an excellent finale.  SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK (you need to by now) xD  Theres the Lake town scene, the white council saving Gandalf, the evacuation of the people of Lake town, the corruption of Thorin and his lust for gold, Bilbo's further addiction to the ring, the arguments between the elves, men and dwarves and then the battle of the five armies which was honestly very boring and anticlimactic for me in the book, but I'm sure will be much longer and less boring in the movie. Then of course there is the journey home and I've heard its not going to be skipped like it was in Return of the King. And I'm sure there will be things added in that connect to the last two films to fill in the gaps. I personally can't wait for this final film, but won't overhype it like I did a bit with DOS, but also don't want it to end. No matter what anyone says, I love these films and both Jackson and Tolkiens work will always hold a special place in my heart. :)",2,0,ZantofDarkness,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.15728715728715728,2014-08-05 18:36:48,True,True

These films should be called ""Thorin and company"". Instead of mass murdering spiders like a mothafuckin invisible Rambo, the films had him kill like 2 spiders tops while the freaking elves basically saved the day. The escape was no longer 100% Bilbo saving the day, the dwarves had to fight and pull levers and open gates and $hit. After that Bilbo is supposed to become the defacto leader. ""Already they had come to respect little Bilbo. Now he had become the real leader in their adventure. He had begun to have ideas and plans of his own."" - Straight from the book. When he talked to Smaug he was supposed to have been talking to him like an equal even if he didn't feel like it. In the movies he takes off his motha fuckin ring and straight up whimpers while Smaug just has a nice chat with him. He was also supposed to be the one who found Smaug's weak spot, not this dumb @ss legend about Girion knocking a scale loose... and last thing, why the F is Bilbo already obsessing over the ring?

Legolas is a minor change to me because it makes sense he would be there, since it's his father's kingdom, and we know he's alive during this time...Several of the things people think are changes, are actually just added in stories from Tolkien's Silmarillion, which gives us a lot of the missing background information missing in The Hobbit book. Peter didn't have the rites to use that book, so he only ""hints"" at its use, though he is practically copying it completely, lol! Anyway...I just want to mention that... I don't see why so many ""hardcore"" fans are so upset...I love Tolkien's work, and I honestly love these movies.

Also I know some people don't like The Hobbit movies, but I don't know, I feel like if you truly understand the Tolkien universe, you'd understand how brilliant Jackson is by splitting these into three movies. Like there is so much information you get in the book that might not fully explain itself, and Jackson is giving it one. For example, in the book, there are long periods of time where Gandalf is away from the dwarves and Bilbo, but Tolkien doesn't really explain what he's up to. (Although, if you're intuitive enough, you can get a hint). But in the movies Jackson gave an explanation, and also a cool introduction to Sauron and an insight to Lord of the Rings. Also, in the book (spoiler) Bard kills Smaug. I just remember feeling kinda confused when I read that, and thinking, wouldn't have it been better for someone with a personal quarrel or something to kill him, not just some bowmen from Laketown? It was still a good scene, but Jackson made it better (in my opinion) by giving Bard a backstory, a reason to feel the need to kill Smaug.

2014-08-31T02:03:44,"I'm actually mildly excited about this one, and that's because it's going to be shorter than the other two. There's no goddamn reason the last two Hobbit movies had to be almost three hours long, especially considering how every new storyline Peter Jackson came up with to pad out the films' length are pretty damn terrible. They quite literally contribute nothing to the plot, even going so far as to hinder the original story's intent.  While the extended editions of The Lord of Rings films are great and manage to feel necessary, the three Hobbit movies need the complete opposite treatment. I would gladly buy an edited down version of the saga that follows the book more closely instead of having to sit through unnecessary relationship angles and god-awful comedic moments that simply don't fit. At all.  The gratuitous use of CGI is still pretty lame, also. Mostly because it STILL doesn't look nearly as good as the stuff they did with the LoTR trilogy, which used practical effects in a more believable way.  And don't get me wrong, the Hobbit movies are enjoyable at points; but in my opinion they don't even come close to meeting the standard established by Peter Jackson in the original trilogy. ",0,0,Leo Rolando,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.12102693602693601,2014-08-31 02:03:44,True,True

Not because the quality at all is at the stand of today's quality. But because of lack of the ""wow""-effect, that the ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy and a little bit the first film of the Hobbit had. The Hobbit DOS weren't that good. Sure, it had it scenes, were goosebumps came. But it was too much action and amazing CGI-effects and so on, but something like quality in great speeches didn't really existed. The quintessence of ""the Lord of the Rings"" hasn't been in the second Part of the Hobbit Trilogy. And now you hear less from the third film than from the both before. Maybe the film will be good, maybe it will have quality like from LotR, but in this term the PR seems to be failing. Final name decision was made at the end of July, and then there were just one trailer. You didn't get your customers in this way. That's not how you sell your film in a good way.

Firstly lotr was crap unless you liked watching a gay midget walking for 6 or 7 hours missing the majority of the good bits in all 3 books, secondly hobbit unexpected journey had a shit more in it to keep the audiences attention and the same for desolation of smaug. Now that I've said that In which part of all 6 films will you find an actual reference to religion I mean give the world a break already fucktards there is no room for your archaic beliefs anymore. I truly believe the world in general would be better off worshiping a dog turd than it would be with any of the mainstream religions of today. Yet I respect all for their beliefs even though they cause more suffering than good.   Oh whats that you say? Do you have proof of religion being holy or good in a general sense then please educate me but please don't try to ignore the billions of people your respective religions have killed. And don't forget if everyone took an eye for an eye the world would be blinded.  All it comes down to is greed and fear people. Greed for what you don't have and are to lazy to work for and fear of what you don't know and are too ignorant to learn. Fuck grow up and learn from your mistakes stop living in the fantasy land your leaders are pushing on you and think for yourselves be human beings no one is better than another person just different and it is those individual differences that make everyone special.  ",0,0,leslie polaski,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.07593193843193842,2014-09-28 08:47:57,True,True

Peter Jackson is in talks with New Line for a potential 2018 release if it goes through, on his Facebook page he wrote possibly doing a miniseries if it doesn't work out but he mentioned some ideas of what it would be focussed on. He would explore deeper into Tolkien's notes following Aragorn protecting the shire as the main storyline, the young days of Gandalf and Galadriel as well, Gullom's journey following losing the ring, the battle before the dead marshes, the mines of moria and even the death of Balin, but more importantly centring on Bilbo dwelling in the shire during the aftermath of his journey to Erebor. He also mentioned in his last paragraph he was trying to get the rights to the Similarion, obviously it would help support this movie, but with this many ideas it looks like it would work well as a miniseries. Also that he would do it entirely animated motion capture, alike Tintin or Beowulf. I am so excited, hopefully it all works out.

2014-10-12T17:55:59,"As many fans of the works of the Great, Genius and Magnificent author J.R.R Tolkien, I read almost a hundred times There and Back Again and the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings, and I cannot say that I know everything, but I know many details, especially the atmosphere in these books. I agree, The Hobbit is in part a children book, but when you read it, there are many dark parts in the book. Many people have pointed this out, I know too, but the CGI really bother me. Its too much, too much. The statue looks false, really false. the weapons too. Just compared Legolas eyes in The hobbit with his eyes in The Lord of The rings. His eyes in The Hobbit looks so blue for no reason, that is, they 'stand out' if I can say that in my average English. Also, yes many movies uses CGI but in the Hobbit, the CGI makes the brightness of the film too striking, too 'blinding'. The colors are too bright and not enough pronounced. If the colors/luminosity was as prononced as in L.O.T.R, that would have improve The Hobbit atmosphere better.   Just go and take a look for those who didn't know about The Hobbit version (1976) by Rankin and Bass. I must say that there's a lot of things missing, it is true, but just observe the atmosphere. In my opinion, they respected the atmosphere, not too dark, not too child's, in between. I love The Hobbit movie tho, it is just my opinion, and it is a bit dissapointing.   Well, I can't wait to see the movie!",0,0,Rhumbrero Loco,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.2212962962962963,2014-10-12 17:55:59,True,True

2014-10-13T19:34:33,"Much as I enjoyed the two Hobbit films, I did feel disappointed for the same reasons many other have pointed out to; corely it's childishness. Now before you say ""The Hobbit is a children's book"". I KNOW. So don't bother :P On the other hand, as someone who adored the Hobbit as a child the thing which grates most heavily is the definite lacking in grit and darkness. Maybe it was a children's book, but when I was a child, the scene with the Goblin King was no laughing matter. I quailed when I heard of the Goblins under the mountain, I was terrified of the mysterious Mirkwood and its deadly secrets, not to mention the incident with the trolls. Now, as an adult, I don't get given nightmares reading these the same way I did as a child, nor do I get nightmares from the film interpretations. The problem? Neither do the kids. I see kids laughing at the Goblin King, awed as the Dwarves fight off the spiders and trolls, and frankly seeming to find little interest in most of the incredible sets nuances. Yet almost never fear, and only from those still too young to realise that the eagle isn't real. Was it wrote for children? Yes. Was it filmed for children? Yes. A little too much, to a degree it almost replaces quality and depth, with idiocies and nonsensical tit-bits. Children can appreciate great stories as much as the rest of us. If I was a child being hyped up to see the Hobbit films, frankly, I think I'd be a little disappointed.",0,0,Eoghan Clark,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.09759615384615386,2014-10-13 19:34:33,True,True

It's art in motion, the imagination of the whole production is outstanding, to bring something like this to life from a book most people never knew about that was way ahead of its time in such a tasteful and dynamic way is brilliant. The song by Billy Boyd was a perfect touch for bringing people back into the LOTR mindset when watching the final battle unfold. Brilliant cinematography. When you spend $750m on a trilogy, that brings in about 2billion, this is how that is justified. He's helped New Zealand so much through these films with the employment of local workshops, and fans always win with his work. Unlike Michael Bay who's a corporate drone who spends about 15min in each movie plugging product placement, Jackson stays true to the roots of each story, and delivers a one of a kind cinematic experience of massive proportions.

Warner Brothers is refusing to let 7 of the Dwarves attend the world premiere of Battle of the Five Armies because they aren't as famous as other actors and WB ""don't want to pay for their flights"". It's really important that ALL the actors in this amazing series are allowed to go to the event celebrating it's conclusion (especially since one of these dwarves was in all 6 LOTR and Hobbit movies!!) There is a petition online which you NEED to sign in order to stop this unfair treatment of these guys! Please sign and share this around as we want to do anything we can to give these actors what they deserve. It is shocking that LOTR actors who aren't even in the Hobbit are going to the World Premiere, while half of the company of Dwarves are left at home that night.   https://www.change.org/p/warner-brothers-let-the-kiwi-dwarves-go-to-london#share  Please upvote this comment so that everybody can see and read this!

2014-11-25T12:46:35,"Unexpected Journey was enjoyable.  Desolation of Smaug was annoying as hell.  That movie is pretty much non-stop filler action that accomplishes nothing.  Typically in writing, if a scene doesn't advance the story or develop characters or resolve an existing conflict, it should be written out.  In the case of the Hobbit movies, however, they have to go out of their way to do the OPPOSITE of this, because the hobbit is not nearly enough story to fill out three 2 1/2 hour fucking movies.  As such the pacing is god-awful and it takes eternity to get from point A to B.  The movies are also full of other subplots and characters that don't fucking matter, such as the orc boss and the whole necromancer story.  Yes yes, the movies have exceptional production values and great music and casting and such.  But for both of the films so far, at least half of the movie could be cut out and nothing relevant would be lost in the process.  Just to mention some examples, it's over 40 minutes into the first film before Blibo LEAVES THE SHIRE.  And in the case of Smaug, we spent what, thirty minutes watching him chase the dwarves around?  A gigantic terrifying ancient dragon that's supposed to be horrendously dangerous and it can't even catch a single fucking dwarf out of the lot of them the entire time, because the whole bit is just filler to fluff up the movie's runtime.  I really wish they'd just made one or maybe two films so that they wouldn't need to cram it with so much bullshit fluff just to make it sizeable.  I cannot wait until all three are out so that someone can do a mega edit and condense all three into a single 3 hour film that's actually watchable.  ",0,0,Angry Nerd Bird,ZSzeFFsKEt4,-0.02390604890604891,2014-11-25 12:46:35,True,True

I did however enjoy the chase between Smaug and the dwarfs even though that is not part of the story.  With Legolas appearing i can accept that part considering how it is his father that comes to fight in the battle of five armies so my biggest disappointment with the movie is the fact the company is split but it does not however ruin my LOVE of the movie.,0,0,Zellania Moon,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.055769230769230765,2014-12-02 13:36:07,True,True

2014-12-05T03:27:31,"Yes, The Hobbit is a cash grab.  Perhaps the CGI is too heavy.  Maybe it didn't exactly follow the book to the letter.  And yes, maybe the 48 fps was a different  experience that some didn't like.  But throughout each of these films, I found myself loving every second of it.  People keep complaining that this film didn't live up to LOTR, yet they forget that the Hobbit story was written by Tolkien as a fun adventure instead of the detailed epic that Lord of the Rings was.  In retrospect, The Lord of the Rings (book or film) is one large story split into three parts.  Its my favorite film franchise and book series ever, so I was very interested to see what Jackson would do with this new trilogy.  With the first two installments, I had a blast.  The action (particularly in the Goblin-town tunnels in An Unexpected Journey and the barrel riding scene in The Desolation of Smaug) were very well-done and entertaining.  The characters were likable and interesting, with Freeman's Bilbo being the best version of the character yet and Armitage's Thorin Oakenshield being a fantastic addition.  I could feel the emotion that made the Lord of the Rings such an epic experience, with Bilbo's speech about home & the dwarves walking through the caves of their lost home being truly moving scenes.  Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Smaug was a revelation.  The actor not only brought the mighty dragon to the big screen, he truly gave us the most memorable dragon ever in cinema.  I'd argue he has been the most charismatic and interesting villain in the entire franchise, including Lord of the Rings.  The Riddles in the Dark scene between Gollum and Bilbo was absolutely brilliant, actually making me laugh and feel the tension throughout.  Andy Serkis will always be captivating as Gollum, who will soon become one of the most fleshed out characters of the franchise.  So was the Hobbit a cash grab?  Yes, but I don't see all these complaints about The Hunger Games or Harry Potter's final installments being turned into two parts.  While I really loved both parts of Mockingjay and the Deathly Hallows, they never fully sold me on them being made into two films.  But whether or not the Hobbit should've been split into a trilogy, to me they have justified their existence by each being a memorable and epic experience.  And when people complain how it doesn't follow the book, they seem to forget the Lord of the Rings trilogy really didn't follow the books much either.  Jackson made a lot of changes to the source material, and the results were fine with me.  Legolas wasn't in the book, yet Bloom was a welcome return who was great in each scene.  Radagast the Brown was a little strange at first, but he was certainly a fun character who shouldn't even be compared to the horror that is Jar Jar Binks.  He isn't George Lucas, who created a prequel trilogy based on action figures and merchandise.  Jackson instead has crafted a very entertaining and exciting trilogy that I felt has justified being created.  I would agree some of the CGI could've been toned down a bit, i.e. the Orcs not having the same impact being CGI beasts instead of real actors.  Makes it lose a bit of the grit, but doesn't ruin the experience and I truly still felt that I was in the same Middle-Earth that I fell in love with 13 years ago.  The Hobbit was never meant to surpass Lord of the Rings, but when its all finished in a few weeks we will have the best saga of films ever made.  I will watch all six Middle-Earth films with a smile on my face, loving every second of it.  While The Hobbit may have been a cash grab, most films in Hollywood nowadays still haven't come close to the incredible impact that these films have on people including myself.  I realize most people enjoy these films, but I just wanted to address people complaints about its comparison to Lord of the Rings.  So thank you Peter Jackson, for once again giving me an unforgettable experience.  ",2,0,Brad Wright,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.31167521595603787,2014-12-05 03:27:31,True,True

Boromirs death was awesome, but after they lost Gandalf it slowed down very much.Don't get me wrong, i still think its great.. i just cant understand how nearly everyone says it's the best by far.

I'm just saying, some people keep complaining these look like kid movies not even based on the book but Jackson based his screenplay not only on the book but on multiple rewrites from Tolkien.

2014-12-12T22:17:24,"Decent movie. Which is bad, because a ""Hobbit"" movie should not be just decent, it should be atleast 9/10 which this movie is not even close to. I am really dissapointed by this movie actually. There were so many cliffhangers that the film just got boring. It was also super-predictable, you knew every time what would happen. Also hate the fact how the dragon died. They made the dragon so epic and built his ""epicness"" up in two movies, just to end it like this. It feels like Peter Jackson just wanted to get him out of the way and so he just killed him in the prelog. Sure, the death could have been good if they just would have made the dragon just a ""dragon"" without personality and shown that he was just a ""object"" who was not really important.  But the picture I got of him in the two first movies was not that one. He deserved a better death and I feel like they could have made something more with him. And when you really think about what happend in the movie in almost 3 HOURS, it was pretty much only a battle at the same location all the movie. 3 hours without any kind of emotion, just fast cuts and weird fighting scenes. Then in the end they just made the ""feels-train"" kick in and killed pretty much every important character which made the ending awful imo. And wtf was up with Azogs closest ""orc-friend""? He sucked at fighting in the second movie and got his ass kicked by legolas and had to escape. But in this movie he whopped ass like never before, dosent make any sense. This movie was not good and stop pretending it was. The CGI was also really bad at some few scenes in the movie, not cool. Same goes with the music, the music has always been really good in the LOTR films but in this movie the music felt like it did not play any important part and had no impact on the film (The other hobbit films used the music alot better.) Imo Peter Jackson can do alot better and the people who actually say good things about this movie, I think should ""rethink"" abit and actually try to accept the fact that this movie was not that great, even tho I really dont want to believe it myself.

Actors energy feeding off other real actors instead of talking to a green screen dragon. The modeling light sources are not consistent with the live actors set lighting. The textures come off as rubbery fake like a video game. Movement on animations like the chariot scene feel unnatural and jerky. I think in ten years we will look back and laugh hysterically how bad this looks. There are many great fantasy films of the past with no digital effects. Fire, explosions, sets, animatronics, puppet creatures, hand made real craft. Now that is a spectacle. Hollywood is getting lazy.

2014-12-20T02:37:47,"Whatever the fuck I just watched, I could name it by any Hollywood bullshit movie, but it was not the Hobbit. Peter Jackson did everything in his power to shit on the source material and deliver us a generic ""action"" flick.  J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this story as a simply children's book. The tone of the book is perfectly modest and subtle, which is why I can say it's my favorite book of all time. The story is about Bilbo Baggins and how he went from being a small and naive hobbit to an experienced adventurer, and all the trials he faced to get there. In this movie, as well as this ""trilogy""'s second installment, it would be a joke to say Bilbo was the main character of anything. Instead, the focus in these films is focused away from Bilbo's humble journey to a cesspool of subplots and unnecessary characters, resulting in possibly the most disappointing movies I have ever seen.  Now, the acting in this movie is amazing. The CG was great (though overused to shit), and the battle scenes were invigorating. However, if I am going to rate a movie based on the Hobbit by its acting, CG, and battles, I would be getting everything wrong. The most important part of these films is the story, and it's clear Jackson was unsatisfied with the story Tolkien wrote. Jackson wanted to direct an epic film, like he had the Lord of the Rings, and so he added in a massive amount of shit to this otherwise small story. Including Azog, Legolas, and Tauriel (whoever the fuck she's supposed to be) into these movies ruins the story that Tolkien had created. Now, instead of being a tale of an ignorant hobbit who overcomes the harshness of the world, it's a massive tale of armies and kings and LOTR tie-ins. Hell, near the end of the battle, Jackson has Radaghast and Beorn come in! Why? Because he cared more about the battle than the story, which is this trilogy's downfall.  This movie failed in every way it should have been good, which is why I'm most saddened. Jackson was given a story, and an amazing one at that, by Tolkien and given the opportunity to adapt this story to cinema. Instead, he took the story and tore it apart, ripping off page by page and adding in his own Hollywood cliches so that there was no longer a masterpiece between the covers.",17,11,Austerlitz,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.06924603174603175,2014-12-20 02:37:47,False,True

However given the poor reviews people here are giving. I hope it isn't as bad what people are making it. ,0,0,BlazinNSoul,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.0979166666666667,2014-12-21 18:18:42,False,True

2014-12-22T23:57:37,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the final installment of The Hobbit trilogy. Bilbo and his company of Dwarves have just unleashed the Dragon Smaug upon a small lakeside village and chaos breaks loose. Once word is out that the dragon has been driven from the mountain, armies from all over the land come to battle for the treasures that lie inside. It is a fight unlike any before and Bilbo must find a way to make peace before it is too late.   I really enjoyed this film. From the very beginning it is full of action, epic battles and suspense. The graphics in this entire series are stunning. The Hobbit never fails to impress me with its immaculate visuals and special effects. The soundtrack to this film is beautiful, as expected, since the rest of the series is filled with wonderful music. I think that this film is the perfect closure to the series that so many have fallen in love with and been loyal fans of over the years.  I’m also very impressed with the fact that this trilogy of films is adapted from one, relatively short novel and every film is so packed full of action and adventure, there is never a dull moment.  The cast is marvelous as usual. Martin Freeman is the perfect actor to play Bilbo Baggins because he embodies his personality so well. It’s been wonderful to watch Bilbo’s character develop over the course of these films. He starts off very timid and unsure of himself, but by the end of the final film he has so much new found confidence from all he’s been through and is a completely different hobbit than he was at the beginning of the journey.  I’m very sad that the series has come to an end and that the journey is over, but I’m glad for the closure and amazed at how well this film turned out. Lord of the Rings fans will clearly love this film, but I think anyone who enjoys action, adventure and fantasy will love this film as well. There is a considerable amount of violence since the majority of the movie is an epic battle, so I suggest this film be viewed by ages 13 to 18-year-olds. If you have seen any of the previous films from The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings series, then this film should be suitable for you.  I give The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies 5 out of 5 stars.

2014-12-23T15:57:51,I really hope the extended version of this movie which is 30 minutes longer gives us more time with characters. Like the whole 1v1 was cool but I didn't really care about it. For example Legolas and Bolg. I mean there was no tension because we knew Legolas would live and Bolg would die. I mean we only saw a good maybe 10 minutes of the dwarves and elves fighting and the Eagles had like a minute of screen time but poor Beorn he only had 10 seconds. Characters like Alfred just need less screen time and characters like Bilbo and Gandalf needed more. I think Thorin got plenty but this movie was kind of a let down.

2014-12-27T17:30:51,"I personally thought that this movie and the other two were pretty darn awesome. Let's go through individually what people hate about these movies. *Minor Spoiler Alert*  Bad CGI: I disagree with this wholeheartedly. Sure, Azog's face was a bit off, but most of the rest of the armies and trolls were pretty realistic. And there's something else. Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit have great CGI because of face cams, and Andy Serkis's methods. Using these, the editors for The Hobbit were able to realisticly track the actions of the CGI orcs (usually Azog and Borg) to make for example, a battle with Thorin seem very realistic.  'It was just one big battle': Sure it was, but what were you expecting from a move called ""The Battle of Five Armies""? Besides, I felt that they did a good job of cutting away from the battle scenes to show, for example the 12 dwarves holed up inside Erebor. To me, I never felt like it had lost the magic of the first two movies.  Peter Jackson made three movies out of one book just to squeeze money out of the book: This may be true, but it's a logical fallacy called a Red Herring to do so. Even if Jackson made 7 movies out of one book, it wouldn't mean that the movies were bad.  I hated how they added Azog and Bolg. They weren't even in the book!: Well first of all, when they made a 9 hour movie based off of a 300 page book, they needed an interesting villain to use some of that time. And second of all, The Hobbit book never had one single villain. Bilbo goes on an unexpected journey to Erebor, sees a dragon slain, five armies battle to take the gold, and he goes back home. Unlike Lord of the Rings, which had one villain named Sauron, The Hobbit seemed less interesting each time the villain went away, whether it be Gollum, Smaug, Orcs, or the Goblin King. However, when you add Azog, a constant villain, the plot can gain more tension and backstory, as well as an epic battle in the Battle of Five Armies.  Radagast was ridiculous with his bunny sled, and Beorn only had like, 5 seconds of screen time!: OK, I have to agree with these ones.  Try making your own movie.

2015-01-16T05:36:36,"Alright, everyone who hates the movies compares its bad points with the book. Let's have a peek at the book then, SHALL WE? The bad points of the book: 1) During the dwarven gathering in his house, Bilbo remains despicably polite. And an answer to an ""At your service"" as ""thank you"" instead of ""At yours"" is considered rude. That's an EXAGGERATION. 2) Dwalin's beard is blue. REALLY? 3) The Elven King of Mirkwood's name is probably the Elven King of Mirkwood, because that's what everyone calls him. PJ giving him the name from LOTR and a personality of his own, and  amotivation to go to Erebor that's not riches, was a crime of the Director's side, right? PF. 4) Half of Middle-Earth knows that Bilbo has a magic ring. Like what a surprise it would be later to see that it'sSauron's ring. 5) Gollum is more described as a marine fish creature. 6) If the movies were made exactly like the book, then half of them would be songs. Songs, songs and again SONGS! 7) I can't imagine the elves of Rivendell dancing and singing ""Tralala"" and ""Hahaha"" all the time. 8) Bard appears out of nowhere as a descendant of Girion, kills the dragon and instantly becomes King. At least in the movies he was given a proper background, a clearer picture of his family and a better reason as to why people liked him. 9) In the movies, Bilbo hid the Arkenstone for fear of corrupting Thorin. In the book, the only first reason he did so was because of the dragon's words made him think that the dwarves would not give him the right fourteenth he deserved, so he took what was most valuable in there. Yes, Bilbo's main motivation in getting the Arkenstone was self-interest. Doesn't matter that he wanted to prevent wars laters, by giving it away. 10) Tolkien gave a better background for Thror, and a better reason why Smaug attacked Erebor anyway. Plus, he in a magnificent way supports the possibility that we have for having read the ""Silmarillion"", that the Arkenstone might be a Silmarillion and a reason of corruption. After all, one of them was lost beneath tons of rock, right? In the book, it's just a cool stone. And a reason for the others to be sort of persuasive to Thorin. 11) Elrond didn't know what Durin's day is. Yeah, sure. 12) The trolls captured the dwarves one by one, and people protest  of why they didn't do so in the movie, but there was an unneded fight. Well, I myself prefered 2 minutes of action, rather than 4 minutes of dwarves coming one after another in the troll camp like idiots and getting captured, only with Thorin giving resistance. 13) The fact that we're shown of the Necromancer and his escapades for Dol Guldur in the movie is awesome. And why not? Did you guys want it to be an extra movie? OR th book Gandalf, leaving his friends behind in the msot dangerous part of their road trip, for ""some business""? 14) Legolas doesn't exist. Of course, Tolkien hadn't thought of him yet, but he was at least 2000 years old by then. Does that give him a reason not to appear as th PRince of Mirkwood or not? For Pete's sake, all this hate for changes TOLKIEN HIMSELF WANTED TO DO TO CONNECT WITH LOTR> But because PJ did them, he's a villain. 15) Most of dwarves only appear in one line or as names. an you tell different Bifur, Bofur, Ori, Nori? No. Oin and GLoin where also just fire-lighters, nothing else for the team. At least the movies gave them their own personalities and backkground for each of them. 16) THe only reason THorin made peace with Bilbo before he died, was because it was a pity to be at war with the hobbit even after death. Not completely because he suddenly changed his mind. At least in the movies we see his corruption from the Arkenstone ANDhow he fought it, on the contrary with THror, and changed mind, so he end befriended with Bilbo again. 17) Suddenly a Bolg son of Azog appears out of nowhere with 1/3 of Gundabaad Goblins.  18) Bolg died with one strike. Yeah, that was so much of suspense. 19) There was no Azog. So what? You're afraid thatDain woul lose his title as Ironfoot? 20) At least the dwarves gave a try to kill the dragon, they did'n hide like cowards from the book or they didn't send Bilbo in 3 times just to check if thr dragon is still there.. Like WTF  Now I get why Tolkien wanted to change the book. But he died, unfortunately, and now every hater of the movie claims the book as canon. GG easy. Well done.  At last, to mention the all-time hated romance of Kili and Tauriel in the movie. Only negative of it was, it would end in so much a tragedy for Kili dies.  Like, stop hating like Orcs already. AN extra pinch of suspense never hurt anyway, it's a Hollywood movie after all. Overall, what did we see in the movies: 13 Dwarves and a hobbit embark from hobbiton, reach rivendell, get captured by goblins, a gollum loses a ring which goes to Bilbo, they meet the Eagles, then Beorn, get lost in Mirkwood and captured by spiders and Elves, reach Erebor, the dragon dies by BARD, there's a five army battle won thanks to the Eagles, and Thorin-Fili-Kili die, with Bilbo returning home. IF THOSE WERE BOTH IN THER BOOK AND IN THE MOVIE, WAS IT NECESSARY TO CRY ABOUT THE MOVIE EXTRAS, ALL BASED ON TOLKIEN WORK, AND GIVING US EXTRA TIME IN MIDDLE EARTH? JESUS!

Despite being canon to one another, the Hobbit as a book doesn’t feel like LotR and the films tried way too hard to make the Hobbit work as a much more direct prequel both narratively and tonally while throwing characters and imagery at you often for no other reason than to say “remember Lord of the Rings? Weren’t those movies good? This is the same universe so these movies are good too.”  I just wish the studio would’ve let LotR stand on its own and gone ahead and let the Hobbit be it’s own lighthearted quirky thing.

The two trilogies are beautieful! A truly masterpiece. It is impossible to make a movie 1:1 to the book. A movie is for entertainment, a book for meditation, because the process of absorbing information by reading is different to the process of viewing. So it was good that the movie was modified to the modern media, without twisting the whole storyline. Peter Jackson did a damn good job. Ian Mckellen brought the original book in the set. That's what I like. A director and the producers who are able to work with the actors and the crew as equal. A very efficiant and creative way to make it possible to bring a work on screen that seems too impossible to be shown in a medium like cinema.",4,0,Kreativjunkie,ZSzeFFsKEt4,0.16011904761904763,2019-03-01 23:15:20,False,False
