Remember when you all said that the TFA trailers were ""already better than the prequels""? Saying that something is already better than another thing based only on trailers is for retards (with all due respect).  - ""Disney is milking the cow!"" Yes, it is, just like LucasFilm has done since 1977 with all kinds of merchandise, novels, comic books, videogames and toys. The difference now is that cinema and TV can be used to tell new stories. How's that a bad thing?  - ""Aghh, a female lead once again. Feminist agenda!!"" Nope. There's still fewer female core characters than males. Get over it. You're allowed to like female characters.  - ""Where are Rey and Finn?"" Nowhere. This is a spin-off movie, set weeks or maybe even days before A New Hope. Episode VIII comes next year.  - ""Another Death Star?!"" Nope. It's the original Death Star. The one from A New Hope.  - ""Where are the Bothan spies?"". Probably, at their homes.

Also, Vader's eyes seem to be caved in so-to-speak due to the fringe of the helmet's tented shape.   In Empire Strikes Back, Vader's eyes are much more visible and the raised ridge that runs between the eyes is a bit higher.

2016-10-13T18:17:10,"The Star Wars I remember was ""Space Fantasy""; A New Hope was like a fairy tale story (farm boy saves princess and defeats evil with help of an old wise knight, comic relief robots and selfish but good-hearted rogues), Empire Strikes Back brought out the legendary magic (swamp hermit teaches mystic ways of the Force) and classical Greek tragedy (father against son), while Return of the Jedi layed the fantasy on thick with forest dwarves, desert monsters and more.  This movie, however, looks like a generic science fiction war story. There's no magic or a feeling of some deep, mysterious, transcendant lore in it, it just looks like a fanfiction romp.  Nothing wrong with that and I'm sure it will appeal to many, but I'm still waiting for real magic to return to this series.  Force Awakens was okay (its main strength was in its great casting and cinematography), but a solid plot with a unique, timeless, fairy tale fantasy quality to it just wasn't there (that flashback dream sequence at Maz Kanata's Castle was particularly very poor storytelling, Starkiller Base was negligible, and the Force was made to be a gimmicky superpower instead of a wonderful, mysterious magic with transcendent mythological, religious and meditative depth).

Yes, Disney is in it for the money, but they know Star Wars has caliber. They're not hiring just any director and writer, they're putting a lot of effort into this. Force Awakens catered to the nostalgic fans, Rouge One seems to cater to those that always wanted spin-offs revolving on an expanded universe, and I think Ep.

I was very disappointed with The Force Awakens because they seemed like they producers cared too much about being politically correct with a female lead and a black co star, when they really should have focused on making an awesome movie. I guess that is just DIsney putting in subliminal messaging so that younger viewers are brain washed into becoming the liberals that ruin our world today by being too easily offended. The movie was also very repetitive. The plot was very similar to The New Hope. I know the new movies need to FEEL like star wars but that doesnt mean the plot needs to be the same. I know this movie has a lead female character, I does NOT seem to shove it in your face that she is better and stronger than the men in the movie. It seems like they are showing her working along side men equally. There are powerful men and powerful women. THAT IS GREAT! One other thing im glad about is the fact that this movie does not have Disney directing it.

2016-10-14T01:28:07,"It's funny seeing all the Lucas bashing.  The man created the characters and the franchise and people still can't their fandom minds away from the prequels.  Well I've always said that if you can do it better then the other person go ahead and do it.  I admire Lucas for sticking to his creative values and not allowing the Hollywood Corporate machine to railroad him into making decisions and movies he did not want to make and for having the business sense to keep the rights he kept that made Lucasfilm into what it became.  How many other movie studios relied on the technology Lucasfilm developed to make their movies enjoyable to watch?  What if Lucas hadn't created the universe he did for everyone to enjoy?  Bash all you want but if it wasn't for his idea to return the Saturday Movie Serial to the modern day big screen none of you would have these movies to enjoy, or bash or talk about nor would the people who made these movies possible have the creative canvas to work and play in.  I don't blame him for ""retiring"" from Lucasfilm or Star Wars since these days a lot of people have unrealistic expectations from filmmakers and storytellers when it comes to a franchise.  Everyone it seems, when it comes to Star Wars, wants to see carbon copies of the original trilogy so no matter what this franchise does the fan base will never be happy or think any of the films that came after the original three will ever be good enough, there will always be something wrong with how the story is told, how it is written, how it is filmed or the fact that some character that was in a novel, video game or some other Star Wars offshoot wasn't involved or mentioned.  No matter what direction any of the future films takes the fans it seems will never be happy.",1,0,Jeff Davad,sC9abcLLQpI,0.16160714285714287,2016-10-14 01:28:07,True,True

And I think one of the key reasons why people are excited about this trailer (or any Star Wars trailer) is that it provides us with images that fit what we know Star Wars to be, but that push that visual conception in new and exciting ways.

Now it's baffling me how you people can't see that, it's the Death Star, ya the one from A New Hope not to hard to see, and I mean freaking Darth Vader! Ya he's been dead for a while so isn't it obvious that this isn't EP 8?! It should be obvious if the main characters from EP 7 aren't anywhere in this trailer. It was kinda funny when the first trailer came out, annoying when the second one came out, and now it's just really annoying.

In the case of Clinton, they would discover that she accepts bribes, is a war monger, and is a pathological liar. And that's not an opinion - it's a fact.  I understand the disdain for Trump - I really do. He's loud, boorish, and crude. But please do not vote for Clinton. Vote with your conscience. The entire world wants Trump to lose - why do you think that is? Because they are worried about us? No. It's because he is a threat to the power structure. Clinton accepts bribes. Trump is an outsider. He won't be influenced by corporations that want to put down a pipeline, or move jobs to other countries. Please. Please do not vote for her.",0,0,Robert S,sC9abcLLQpI,-0.11342592592592593,2016-10-14 08:03:54,True,True

2016-10-15T03:05:56,"I really love the dark and gritty tone that this trailer is giving off. It seems like this movie is going to revisit some of the locations and characters of the Original Trilogy but from a completely different, and darker perspective. That's why I'm really excited for this movie. The opening scene of Episode VII where the storm-troopers are flying into battle felt very intense, and then the part where Finn gets blood smeared on his helmet from the dying hand of a fellow storm trooper really pushed that dark tone. But then the rest of the movie that vibe was lost and replaced with ... something else, something a bit more toned down. I think that's why Rogue One *could* be better than VII. I also really loved episode III which did a good job of pulling of a more mature, girtty tone and was the best of the prequels IMO.",1,0,brickman409,sC9abcLLQpI,0.3090849673202614,2016-10-15 03:05:56,True,True

2016-10-15T04:31:15,"I'm cautiously optimistic about the movie. The idea looks great. Hopefully this won't be another case of the trailer being better than the movie. For me that will be highly dependent on the film's protagonist and her teammates.   I don't mind female leads (quite the opposite, actually). I just want them to be allowed to fail at some point. To actually struggle. To not resemble an RPG character whose stats are maxed out in all categories. Rey sort of fell into that trap. She's a good mechanic (why? she was scavenging parts, not putting things together), a good pilot (when has she ever been in a cockpit of any kind where she can actually see the effects of the buttons she is pressing?), a skilled martial artist (how did she learn this when she was established as a dedicated loner?), a decent marksman (a bit odd, since she said she's never used a blaster in her life before nailing a stormtrooper at a fair distance), an adept Force wielder (she uses the Jedi Mind Trick without ever even seeing of it being done before), and a decent fighter with a lightsaber (wouldn't be so bad if it weren't that lightsabers are more like fighting with flashlights than anything Rey has ever used before). None of these in isolation is a bad thing. Many could have easily been fixed with a single line of dialogue per issue in explanation. Taken altogether, it makes her somewhat uninteresting in that she seems to have no hurdle to overcome the way Luke had to. Maybe if they make her more arrogant in the next film that would help since it would fit nothing appearing to be a challenge.   Oddly, enough what nearly killed Episode VII for me was Kylo Ren. He just wasn't all that threatening. He had all of Anakin's worst traits (and Luke's if you want to exaggerate how he acts when we first met him to insane levels) while lacking Vader's intimidating presence. Really, he should have left that mask on; it was the only thing he had going for him.   This new film might be good. I hope so. If they give all the characters strengths and weaknesses the way they did the crew of the Ghost in Star Wars: Rebels or the crew of the Ebon Hawk from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic the film will be great. To borrow KOTOR's RPG mechanics as an analogy,  while the lead (the player character) could be quite overpowered by the end of game, there were still things that other characters were better suited for. Everyone had their own specialization (this could be easily magnified or decreased by the player if desired). It also helped the story that the supporting characters were interesting (more so than the lead in many cases) and the villain was at least somewhat intimidating.  With Vader in the mix Rogue One at least has one truly intimidating villain. Hopefully the Rogue One team will be as interesting as the teams I previously mentioned. Nothing is worse than watching a movie where you don't really care what happens to the protagonists.",0,0,John Allosso,sC9abcLLQpI,0.1362561707298549,2016-10-15 04:31:15,True,True

2016-10-15T08:51:39,"StarWars Movie & TV show timeline:  StarWars episode 1 The Phantom Meance  StarWars episode 2 Attack of the Clones  StarWars The Clone Wars season 1-6 (TV Show)  StarWars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith  StarWars Episode 3.5 Rogue One   StarWars Rebels season 1-3 so far             (Tv Show)  StarWars Episode 4 A New Hope  StarWars Episode 5 Empire Strikes Back   StarWars Episode 6 Return of the Jedi  StarWars Episode 7 The Force Awakens  StarWars Episode 8 (Being filmed)  StarWars Episode 9 (Unreleased)  For goodness sakes people. You literally have the whole of the Internet at your finger tips. Yet you start asking silly questions in the YouTube comments. When you're seconds away from receiving an answer if you just do some online research... Seriously It's not hard and only takes a few mere seconds.  Disney is in talk about more upcoming StarWars films, they are:   This movie has been confirmed to happen, and will be released on  May 25 2018: Han Solo Anthology  Christopher Miller and Phil lord are directing this film. (Han Solo when he was younger. All the journeys that's he done. How he met Chewbacca, Lando and the Millennium Falcon). The actor who will be playing Han Solos younger self is someone called: 'Alden Ehrenreich'. Look up videos of him to see if you think he can play a good Han Solo.   There's also going to be another Anthology film most likely based around Boba Fett, released in 2020  Boba Fett Anthology  (This will either show Boba Fett when he was slightly younger and he became a Bounty Hunter. Or it will show how he escapes the Sarlacc Pitt and what he decides to do).  My personal opinion: Right I'm 16 and to be honest, please don't get angry at me. StarWars the Force Awakens was a let down for me. Personally I was hyped for it and so was my family, but when watching it there were a lot of let downs for me. When leaving the cinema it just felt empty. For me because there were quite a lot of flaws. Don't get me wrong every movie has its flaws. Yet this movie had  many and a lot of scenes that just didn't make sense. One of the biggest issues was having StarKiller base. I believe they should've saved the third death till episode 9. At the end of episode 9 they could've had a huge battle uniting the heroes against the Sith on Starkiller base, etc:  (just a rough idea) For me I was just disappointed. They had 37 years to come up with an amazing storyline after A New Hope, and instead they released The Force Awakens. Don't get me wrong there was a few good scenes, and if you enjoy it then I don't hate you and I respect your decision. Personally I didn't like it. On the other hand Rogue One looks amazing. It's a StarWars movie that looks to be like no other. We are actually witnessing a huge Sci Fi war driven movie. With apparent scenes like Vader being surrounded by 100s of Rebel troops and then he force smashes the ground around him lifting the troops in the air and then wreaking havoc against them all. Tearing them apart piece by piece. If that is true then Rogue One will be an amazing movie I have no doubts. Regardless even if we don't get that scene in sure there will be other scenes which will be a lot better.",4,0,Marcus Dyer,sC9abcLLQpI,0.037715756465756464,2016-10-15 08:51:39,True,True

On top of that it  makes the heroes, like Luke Skywalker, more heroic in (somewhat) ending the reborn  Sith'ari line that began with Darth Bane and over 1,000 years lead to  Darth Sidious and Darth Vader.

Felicity Jones is a really good actress (for proof, watch The Theory of Everything), and the rest of the cast is great too. Who cares what race they're from? They're CHARACTERS! That's what is important. Disney has been churning out quality products, and this looks amazing. Also, did people complain about Harry Potter or Obi Wan or Han Solo being too perfect?

He is personally on the battlefield, yet his troops?   Well he has those dudes in black so I guess that is supposed to replace all the many thousands of folks who someone in his position should have under him.  Sure there will be some contrived plot about how she grew up and the empire didn't notice it was her even when she was imprisoned.   But somehow the resistance knows her backstory and the Empire doesn't?  Bad bad bad.   Sure the trailer looks good and so did TFA but plot and story wise it really is overly convoluted and contrived.    Trying to fit family relationships into every single major story line in Star Wars doesn't make sense just because it is star wars.  If anything such a film should be showing how the rebel alliance would have been putting all their forces on this mission with their most crack troops leading the charge, AKA their ""special forces"".   Because it is an all or nothing gambit.  This movie would be a perfect example to show the state of the rebellion and the cat and mouse game versus the empire.

You see the battle on Hoth where the a major Rebel Stronghold gets wiped out at the cost of a couple stormtroopers and AT-ATs... and that was with the Empire making the mistake of dropping out of hyperspace early.

One day he leaves his children with relatives in uncharted worlds and goes to the Imperial Headquarters on Coruscant, steals imperial intel (military tactics, technology, weapons, medical intel, intel on secret testing facilities and ship yards) and blows up half of his building, including his office to cover up his tracks.  He heads back to his apartment booby traps it, then goes to hide in the lower city where he meets a rebel contact who helps him join the rebelion. He then is part of the Rebel conquest of the Galaxy all the way to Coruscant where he witnesses the massacre of Imperials and innocent civilians in the war and just when it ends and Mon Mothma proclaims herself interim Chancelor he defects because he found out that the Rebels were as skewd as the Imperials.  In the end Mon Mothma issues the execution of all Imperials, ex imperials, rebels who were imperials and their children because she belived they were at fault of the genocide and enslavement of Billions. My main character Changes his credentials and goes into hiding. One of the Galaxy's most important and influential men is errased from all records. Without his military tactics the Rebelion would have never gotten down to the Galactic Core. But there they are you're so called heroes: Mon Mothma, Leia, Han,Luke ect. and the Jedi taking away all the fame when they acomplished nothing.

Yes this is a war movie but normally wars are fought with two sides featuring mostly folks who believe in what they are fighting for. Or in the case of good vs evil, the good guys believe in the cause of good and the bad guys... the not so good. So if this is one of the most pivotal chapters in the rebels war against the empire you would expect more dedicated professional military loyalists at all levels as opposed to such a large number of ""rag tag"" mercenaries who may or may not be dedicated. Sure mercs have their place but their loyalty is to the money and adventure .... AKA Han Solo. Most war movies are about politics, strategy, logistics and deception which are just as important as the actual fight itself.

They seriously  undervalued the Death Star concept . Maybe it was undervalued because they wasn't expecting the story to go beyond the first 3 movies.      Now that the Stars wars stories are expanding then what man made weapon can possibly  top the threat of a planet killer. A galaxy killer ? No, too much power. They started out too high in the threat category with no where else to go , except for a galaxy invasion. This is why in the Force Awakens movie they just recycled the same old threat of a weapon endangering entire  planets.

They both had a similar objective of retrieving and transporting important cargo (Cortana and Star Dust). They both lost the fight to the enemy, but not the war.

III and a prequel to Ep. IV and tells the story, how the Death Star plans got stolen; how much can there be a new story line???   I think, it was worth to make a movie about that chapter of Star Wars history.  But of course I would not reject something different, let's say, some movies about the very old times in Star Wars history, i.e. about the Old Republic and the Sith-Wars. That would be refreshing and a chapter also worth making movies about it, since so far only video games were released featuring the events of the early Star Wars universe.  And actually, I was very surprised that they could recreate the faces of Tarkin and Leia so well!

2016-12-28T02:23:43,"I see a lot of glowing reviews, perhaps I watched a different movie.  The good: For the hard-core fans, yes see it. Also, the story was not a simple remake; that part is good. And, as always, the special effects were great.   The bad: For me, this movie was dark, brooding, had non-stop tiresome violence and killing, was overly long, and had milk toast tie-ins to the characters we know. Also, the audience was assaulted with a plethora of unknown characters without background, context or hope. What was missing: any on-screen friendships that you could care about, light moments, or really anything to make you smile. What little humor/friendship there was, was flatly negated by the end of the movie.  The flick had a very impersonal torch to bear. Like an explosion, the movie tore through the story line in a rush to fill in the gaps of the SW master story line, but in the process, it abandoned any concern for simple warmth, basic charm, or even subtle charisma. I left the theater tired and in a funk; longing for some of the Lucas' bad prequels.   Conclusion: In the end, I don't regret that I saw it, but I would not watch it again; this is one of my least favorite SW films (episode 3 is still at the bottom, by a good margin). Perhaps your take will be better than mine.",1,0,B Kap,sC9abcLLQpI,0.06111819727891158,2016-12-28 02:23:43,False,True

2017-01-18T23:50:28,"this movie is OK - first act: overly staid and dark, second act: overwritten, third act: popcorn fluff.   The writers and director missed the tone of the series, and the 'tough, in the moment' look of all the hand-held cam and shallow depth of focus made the film read like a Borne spy flick. Worse still, they accelerated all the action ala Star Trek Into Darkness so even the vastest, most intricate CGI scenes seem to just buzz by in seconds, making the whole project feel disposable,  Ultimately, you need a good writer with the appropriate tone for the Star Wars mythology, this film feels overwhelmingly like a Gareth Edwards action flick bolted onto Star Wars set pieces, and Gareth Edwards isn't the worlds finest storyteller by any stretch. The PROBLEM with so many group cast FX heavy action/escapism films these days is that the aesthetic is so disposable. Why can't they try and match PACING to naturalistic pacing? Is animation something that editors all speed up 30% in final edit for effect?

2017-02-26T21:55:45,"I'm not looking forward to The Last Jedi. The Force Awakens was an overhyped and by-the-numbers cash grab, Rogue One was boring filler that adds nothing of value to the series, and getting one of these movies every year is just setting the franchise up for becoming even more bloated and oversaturated. Why not put some actual time and effort into the story and characters, and create a product that's worth the wait?  I get that they have a brand and it's all about that bottom line. But does Disney REALLY need the merchandising profits that badly? Star Wars was already hugely popular before it was being shoved in your face everywhere you go around the month of December. Four movies that Disney put out last year were among the top five highest-grossing movies of 2016. The other one in the top five? Their own movie, Rogue One. You're not losing any money if you take your time, Disney. It's the basic principle of quality over quantity, I get it, a huge chunk of Disney's consumer base is impatient children who need instant gratification. Kids are demanding little hellions.  Star Wars is becoming more and more of a soulless shell of its former self. They'll be making these movies long after we're dead, until every little thing about the franchise is as familiar and recognizable as the back of your own hand. And they will continue to make money and sell merchandise, and the franchise will reign dominant - not by telling a story or captivating audiences but by pushing a popular and beloved brand.",0,1,another awful shitposting channel,sC9abcLLQpI,0.14926470588235294,2017-02-26 21:55:45,False,True

It FINALLY answered questions (i.e. the opening scroll text of ""A New Hope"" mentioned the rebellion's first victory...why didn't the movie didn't SHOW the battle and the spies stealing the plans), and it added new details to ""A New Hope"" that finally helped a lot of things make sense.

2018-01-26T19:10:12,"If you remove the words ""Star Wars"" from the title, Rogue One is a pretty below-average space action movie. The story muddles along without doing anything, the characters aren't developed, the direction is all over the map, scenes felt staged and not organic to the plot, it didn't feel like a living world, there is no furtherance of the franchise lore. .. Come to think of it, you can apply those statements to Disney Star Wars in general. Although I didn't see The Last Jedi.. I had no desire for more, after 2 boring movies that did nothing with themselves.  Once you remove the nostalgia glasses, there is nothing here to appreciate. Disney is content to freeze the franchise in carbonite and simply tote it out for display every year, until people catch on to the fact that it's not actually alive.  As a very basic example of Disney's total lack of creativity: Why are the Imperials using AT-AT Walkers on a sandy beach island planet/area (1:39)? It makes ZERO sense, except that people recognize the image as associated with Star Wars. Why not some hover-boat weapons platform? Why not an agile flying combat craft? They could have done something INTERESTING! But no..we get the same thing that we've seen before, and will continue to see until the profits start to drop.
