Action scenes are awesome and it looks like there's going to be much more robot screentime.¬† But still there are a few things that are disappointing for me. -Humans, some are good and important, some are really there for nothing. There's this random girl that all she does is hind behind cars, scream and run, she's probably not going to be important to the story at all, just like the last actress in the original trilogy. Why is she there?¬†Other than that i see more humans, the girl's boyfriend, and Mark Wahlberg, who I believe is Sam. Now, Sam is kinda important to the story and I'm looking forward to Wahlberg's acting, but the others really don't need to be there, I think Sam should join the army or something, he can't just shoot alien weapons around with no equipment and being caried by Bumblebee.

IMO, the human drama and the whole stupid triangle between the dad, daugher + boyfriend could have been reduced a LOT, and turning this into a 2 hour + 15 min rather than close to 3 hours.  2. THey just threw creation and prev. transformers creation lore into the bin. Yea, there's a new alloy that allows creation of transformers, but what about the idea of Energon? The fact that the new decepticons literally decompose themselves into particles and into robot form may look awesome, but it's completely broken, if it' the same material as the Transformers, why couldn't the Autobots do it?  3. The serious lack of Galvatron + Dinobot robot forms. Spoilers: Galvatron doesn't DO much in the movie. The Dinobots' robot forms were cool, why couldn't it be more better utilised.  4. Lack of development or the reason why the government official is working with Lockdown, his motivations don't really fit his actions completely.  5.

I loved the first 3 Transformers movies (yes, even the widely panned and hated Revenge of the Fallen), as they had epic CGI, cool robot fights, awesome one-liners, and enough humor to keep one chuckling every so often. But Extinction is a steaming pile of shit. I'm sorry to say it, but it's fucking terrible. I saw it, and words alone can't express how disappointed I am.  It's not Bay's fault, as he did the best he could with the script he was given. Visually, Extinction is gorgeous, but the script is a friggin mess. The story is fragmented with multiple frayed threads and set against a backdrop of expositionary nonsense, the main villain lacks focus and conviction, the human bad guys are laughably cartoonish in their malevolence, and the dialogue is beyond horrendous. Optimus starts the movie damaged and in sore need of repairs, and his near-successful lobotomization at the hands of the human agency hunting him is the only thing that can explain the crappy lines and inane drivel he spouts through the entire film. Gone are the days of ""I'll take you all on!"" and ""You left me no choice, brother..."", now replaced instead with (paraphrasing here) ""We're not your technology!!!11!!!1!"".  I mean, come on! What the fuck?!  Also, the main story arc is complete and utter shit. At no point does the multitude of parallel threads converge in one logical and satisfying conclusion, but remain only tangentially relevant to each other throughout the entire movie. Oh, and the widely-advertised Dinobots? Deux Ex Machina. They appear during the final 15-ish minutes of the film, dropped there by a convenient plot mechanic, and then help the Autobots defeat a cookie-cutter, soulless army of 50-something mass-produced 'Decepticons' (and I use the word lightly, since none of them have any lines or personality).  Laughable.  All I have to say is, for shame, Ehren Kruger, for shame. You could've done so much more with the script. I honestly hope you step up your game for #5, or they get someone else to pen the story. Sadly, the movie is making so much money, it's doubtful Paramount will sack Kruger. Which means the next film in the franchise will also probably turn out no different - a fat, steaming disappointment.

Transformers used to be fun and the action felt exciting, to be honest. This movie just obliterates the senses and succeeds in making you hate every character of the film. I, personally, want Shia Lebouf back in the franchise. Even though he's a stuttering idiot, at least he's a kid who gives some genuine laughs during his endeavors with the Autobots. Mark Wahlberg was a step in the other direction, however, the end moment where he chooses to help Optimus against his will was a small glint of light for what a good main character could become.  'Dark of the Moon' is a prime example of how the formula should play out. There's a shred of mystery to it, there's Decepticons hiding on the moon waiting to take over the world and everyone fights in the end. At least I know why anything is happening. 'Age of Extinction' has absolutely no coherency to any of the action. Pick a simple plot and feed us the VFX, Michael Bay, that's all you need to do.

As expected, the blonde girl and Shane were very annoying and unecessary, but at least they tried to give some importance to them, when they helped Optimus in the final battle, and when they were running away from the CIA or something at the beginning of the movie.¬†  Mark Wahlberg was very good, and SOOO much better than Shia (duh). I actually really liked his character too and I think he was really important when he helped Prime in the last battle with Bumblebee.¬†  The Robot/Human screentime was well balanced and the Robots actually had much more personality, they talk a lot more than the last movies, and I really like that. What I didn't like is that they are very immature and get pissy out of anything.¬†  I really liked Optimus in this one, he's way darker, and so is the movie. I just don't like how he flew at the end, like he got his flying thing back outta nowhere, that was a WTF thing. There were lots of WTF moments in this movie, stupid nonsense moments. Like when the Autobots decided to invade the """"transformium"" place"" outta nowhere because they saw Ratchet's head, and then when they got there, they talked to the 'inventor' and Optimus was like ""yeah you know what, that was kinda dumb, lets go guys"".¬†  Soundtrack was awesome IMO, Steve Jablonsky did a great job.

There's a conflict and mystery, but also a discovery about their existence not being ""Fate"" but more of an invention by an unknown race of the universe. There's also a neat dynamic between Cade and his daughter Tessa and Prime with Bumblebee and how similar their relationships actually are. With this new storyline, the movie is also genuinely funnier without being dirty all the time, the action is MUCH easier to look at and a lot cooler, the special effects are incredible as always, and you care about every character this time around, especially the autobots. I think this movie was just a BIT too long but there wasn't ever a dull moment like in the action with the last trilogy.

Act 1 ¬† (all in cybertronian speak w/ subtitles) Cybertron, A peaceful city of Robotic life on the surface, but within its population two factions war over it's control. ¬†The Autobots and Decepticons. ¬†Most civilians are sympathetic for the Autbots but aren't combat bots and are too frightened of the ever growing Decepticon faction. ¬†Drawing near and in large numbers Autobot Leader Optimus Prime knows if Megatron got his hands on the Matrix of Leadership he would be able to create armies of Decepticons and he order's his best lieutenant's and soldiers into The Ark, and departs Cybertron to avoid destruction and hide the Matrix. ¬†But deceit. ¬†Megatron, and his top lieutenant's have snuck aboard the Ark and a battle ensue's. ¬†Nameless transformers die here in the pitch battle until a uncontrolled Ark is struck by a meteor and damaged. ¬†Crash landing on earth the bots sleep for a million years. ¬†  Act 2¬†  Teletraan 1 begins waking A's and D's. ¬†The D's gather their wounded in no condition to fight and retreat away from the Ark before the rest of the Autobots are awoken. Both factions are awake and begin repairing while Megatron sends Lazerbeak on a reconnaissance mission. ¬† All original 18 Autobots that survived the crash are present. Bumblebee, and Huffer rescue a young man from death as he investigates disturbances he'd heard while he camped in the desert the night before. ¬†(the D's leaving) The Autobots are curious about the organic life form and take him back to the Ark to meet Optimus, who then orders the bots to learn everything they can about the life form. ¬†Ratchet scans him with a laser and investigates their DNA and Wheeljack begins tapping into the Internet and within a minute or so they all download the language and start speaking English (With all the quirk's from G1)(Ie, Sunstreaker only worked well with his Twin brother Sidesweep, Jazz's cool attitude. Trailbreaker's ¬†indecisiveness. ) (Unique abilities are also present!)  Act 3  The Decepticons are mobilizing, openly and covertly attacking military installations, museums and other locations and stealing resources to build a beacon to contact Cybertron. ¬†Here we meet the Original crew of Decepticons, Soundwave, Starscream, Skywarp, Thundercracker, Reflector and Laserbeak, Ravage and Rumble. The Autobots are revealed during a rescue live to the world. ¬†Some military and police units become aggressive but the Autobots set them at ease with soothing words. Meanwhile, an attempt on Teletraan 1 for blueprints is thwarted by Huffer, Bumblebee and Ratchet. ¬†Wheeljack is badly injured.  Act 4  Optimus senses the Decepticons mobilizing and intercepts an attempt on the Pentagon and White house in a full scale battle, while many bots are damaged Ratchet transforms into his not well known third form which is in my movie a Mobile repair unit keeping his comrades from being fried. ¬†The Autobots hold back the D's and save the humans securing their partnership for the many hardships they face ahead of them. ¬†Secretly, the decepticons have finished their Beacon and while licking their wounds, activate it sending a message to Cybertron.  Final Act  Optimus is strolling with Spike or another character on the plains alone and Megatron attacks. ¬†They fight outlining their plans for the Earth and Megetron is forced again to retreat. ¬†Back at The Ark a young man in a wheelchair is directing engineer's as the The Ark is being excavated from within the mountain, one of the Autobots notices bones within the soil as they work. ¬† ¬†End Credits...¬† After Credits scene..¬†  Inside an icy shell, Starscream's best friend Jetfire sleeps in the Ice. ¬†He was lost many years before the Ark left cybertron on a Recon Mission  (Not Megatron. ¬†God I hate Michael Bay's Transformers!)  That would be an Awesome movie, and what's more it would be a huge nod to the years and years of G1 Transformers alot of us grew up with. ¬†It leaves the possibilities so open story lines wise and stays True to the source material. ¬†Trasformers (g1) is what I'd what it reffered to and Transformers 2: (g1) would introduce many of the new faces you see added over season 1. ¬†I'd even want to do a prequel Transformers: Cybertron Wars (g1). ¬†Explaining the history of Cybertron, the Matrix of Leadership and how the warring factions began.",5,50,JaybayJay,DkIPIkPPbdo,0.12661135161135162,2014-09-29 16:22:56,False,False
