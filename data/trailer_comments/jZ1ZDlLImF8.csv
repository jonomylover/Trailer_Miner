Michael Mann did a great job with the movie and like the chemistry between Chris and Lee Hom, but it failed to capture the audience's appeal towards hacking.

(unless you use common core, in which case blue + Q - the speed of imagination in a vacuum divided by banana = 2.) well, in that sense there shouldn't be any real surprises here (there is one thing that did surprise me, but i won't spoil it, just that it was entirely unnecessary ~ surprising, but rather a storytelling head-scratcher).   add everything, plus the fact you find yourself leaning forward to hear the dialogue over the music, and i feel as if it falls into a lot of what i recall mann's movies to be like, smart and competently made, yet failing to commit to being one thing or another and leaving me with split feelings about as a result.",0,1,ryan barker,jZ1ZDlLImF8,0.11376306620209058,2016-02-24 03:52:00,False,False
