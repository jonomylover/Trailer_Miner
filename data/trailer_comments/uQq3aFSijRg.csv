2017-10-08T06:27:29,why do they always keep out the real history of winnie the pooh.  Winnie the pooh was from christopher robins time at the london zoo to meet the real winnie the pooh which the author son fed the bear honey.  if they don't have that scene. then this movie failed at telling the real story. Milne never discovered winnie the pooh from the toy that christopher played with . Milne named it after the city the military officer came from when he brought the bear over to england in world war 1.  which was winnipeg.  Winni- the- pooh. winni was short for winnipeg.,0,0,TheBlazersfan22,uQq3aFSijRg,4.625929269271485e-18,2017-10-08 06:27:29,True,True
