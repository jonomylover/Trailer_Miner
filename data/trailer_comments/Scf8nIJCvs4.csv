2019-03-20T16:44:08,"Man! NO PRESSURE...but it's almost SCARY... to think what Quentin Tarantino's 10th film is going to be like!?!  This TRAILER could sell tickets! LOL  DiCaprio. Pitt. Robbie, PACINO, OLYPHANT, Damian Lewis, Kurt ""F@#CkinG"" Russell (Best Wyatt Earp Ever!...sorry Jimmy RIP),Tim Roth, Marsden and pretty much EVERY A-List Actors in Hollywood along with the single best Bruce Lee impression I have ever seen!   But I guess that shouldn't be too surprising given Quentin Tarantino's love for martial arts movies. (OH!!! THAT'S HIS NEXT FILM!!! and should have Jackie Chan, Jet Li and all great living martial arts masters!    Done by Quentin Tarantino!?!    (Thinking... I'm wondering if Hollywood made a deal with Quentin Tarantino to hire half of Hollywood and release this film mid-summer to give the other ""blockbuster"" summer movies a chance to get some revenue before this one hits theaters?   Because once it does only a handful of films will likely even register at the Box Office.)  They'd have to pass out anti-stroke medication at the ticket counter because of the intense back to back, visceral action and fight scenes... I digress...)  Quentin Tarantino is probably the only person in Hollywood to get most of these actors willing to do one of his projects for ""scale) but I'm sure the CAA and WME people wouldn't allow that!  My only complaint is I think ""The Quentin"" needs to start selling stock in each movie project so us mere mortal members of the public can get a piece of the financial action. Heck! He might never need to go to Hollywood for another dime ever again! (do they still make dimes?)  Another Tarantino ""Cult Classic"" gone mainstream!

Yani fragmanda g√∂rd√ºƒü√ºm√ºz ≈üu: 0:19 DiCaprio aksiyon sahneleri, hƒ±zlƒ±ca g√∂receƒüimiz flashback anlarƒ± olacak b√ºy√ºk ihtimalle :/ Umarƒ±m √∂yle olmaz da Kill Bill'de ki gibi uzun uzun aksiyon sekanslarƒ±yla izleyiciyi tƒ±ka basa doyurur Tarantinocuƒüumuz :) 2- Ve yine tahminimce; bu filmde, Charles Manson lavuƒüunun, ki lavuk ≈üu oluyor: 1:09  m√ºritleri, ki m√ºritleri de ≈üunlar oluyor: 0:46 Sharon Tate'i ve arkada≈ülarƒ±nƒ± katledemeyecekler. Brad Pitt ve Leo DiCaprio yeti≈üip kurtarak onlarƒ± yani en azƒ±ndan bazƒ±larƒ±nƒ±.  Ger√ßekte olanlar bu filmde olmayacak yani bence.

2019-03-21T00:15:45,"ourforgiveness. c*o*m  Have you ever asked yourself why read the Bible (the Word of God); imagine a sky scrapper that has 200 floors, you step into the elevator and as you begin your ascension you first see at eye level, and as you rise, by the time you reach the 50th floor, you are able to receive a greater view of the city, and by the time you have reached the 100th floor, your panorama view is amazing; roads, houses, and people are everywhere. And finally, once you reach the top, your reaction is breathtaking as you are able to see for miles. What changed? I mean technically, you were in the same spot, but you just had a different point of view as the elevation increased. Well, in Like so manner, reading and studying the bible thru the Spirit of God (Holy Spirit) will amplify your understanding and knowledge of every word that is written. As a newly converted Christian, you may at first begin to see the superficial of the text, but as you mature in spirit, you begin to discover new angles, meanings, revelations, connections, or understandings of the very same verse. And at times the revelation can be so profound that you simply sit back and ponder on the depths of each and every word. After all, every word was carefully selected by God. I tell you, time begins to accelerate and light shortens when you seek after the many fold mysteries of God. He who has saith that the bible is dull or boring, has not know his maker. He who has made claim to have read the bible in a short period of time, has not diligently searched for the hidden angles. For I tell you, and many brothers would attest, that it takes a lifetime to learn to live by the Word of God. If any man seeks after knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, but above all, a relationship with God, then this is a call for you.   How be it that the world is not rushing to inquire of such great power and truth? -Its free to everyone.",0,0,ourforgiveness *com,Scf8nIJCvs4,0.15945855614973264,2019-03-21 00:15:45,True,True

2019-03-21T00:57:47,"The Bible is absolute truth, and God is very real and loves you beyond description. Things that were written over 2,500 years ago are happening NOW. There‚Äôs proof of many things that were said in the Bible, and prophecies that are being fulfilled. In Isaiah 17, it says that Damascus, the Capital Of Syria, will be a heap of ruins. Look at it now. There‚Äôs been civil war in Syria for some time now, and that city is being destroyed. Ezekiel 38 says that there will be a war against Israel in the last days involving nations such as Magog, Persia, Beth Togarmah, Cush, Put, And Gomer. Magog is Russia, Persia is Iran, and Beth Togarmah is Turkey, all of which are allies and north of Israel in Syria at this very moment. How could the prophet Ezekiel have known that 2600 years in advance if it wasn‚Äôt God-inspired? There are so many more examples, of course.  The Nation Of Israel turned 70 recently, May 14th last year, and Bible prophecies have been fulfilled at amazing speed. Jesus is coming soon. It isn‚Äôt hard to be saved. God loves you, and wouldn‚Äôt want to see you perish. All you need to do is believe in your heart that The Lord Jesus was raised from the dead, it‚Äôs very simple. You don‚Äôt have to be baptized, or speak in tongues, or anything like that.  We are all sinners, we all need a savior. Romans 3:10 says ‚ÄúAs it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one.‚Äù Romans 3:23 says ‚ÄúFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;‚Äù  The punishment for this sin is death. Romans 6:23 says ‚ÄúFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.‚Äù 1st Corinthians 15:21-22 says ‚ÄúFor since by man came death, by man came also the Resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.‚Äù   New life in Jesus Christ can start today. The word Gospel means ‚Äúgood news.‚Äù The good news is that everyone can have a hope in Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead. If you believe that He was raised from the dead, you will be saved. 1st Corinthians 15:1-4 says ‚ÄúMoreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures;‚Äù  By having full faith and trust in Jesus Christ, that He died for our sins, and rose again from the dead on the third day, you are saved. If you TRULY believe, and don‚Äôt believe in vain, you are saved.  There‚Äôs nothing we can do by ourselves that saves us. Jesus said ‚ÄúIt is finished‚Äù when He died, meaning that everyone‚Äôs sins are paid for. Once the Holy Spirit takes residence in you, then good works for God start producing from your life. Ephesians 2:8-10 says ‚ÄúFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. Not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are his workmanship, created unto Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.‚Äù  Romans 10:9-10 says ‚ÄúThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.‚Äù  Romans 10:13 ‚ÄúFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.‚Äù",0,1,Luke Rentz,Scf8nIJCvs4,0.18044536271808995,2019-03-21 00:57:47,True,True

I'm just hoping Tarantino plays the Tate-murders more ""straight"" than...not. Hard to gauge from this footage. Basically my hope is the tone of this film is more similar to Jules Winnfield's monologue at the end of ""Pulp Fiction"" (""YOU'RE the weak, and I am the tyranny of evil men. But I'm trying, Ringo- I'm trying REAL HARD...to be the shepard""), as opposed to the sort of almost whimsical, quasi-lighter touch (in my opinion) he's displayed recently (such as the operatic carnage and dancing horse at the end of ""Django Unchained"").   And I'm hoping he doesn't go too overboard with the anachronisms. But if he DOES....I hope he goes overboard well. I'll never not root for him.

When we finally got in we were all kind of miserable and regretting spending $20 each on tickets because our hands and feet were numb. We sat down for the movie. The owner of the theatre came out and starting talking about the filming techniques used for the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino came out wearing mittens,  an aviator hat, and a brown leather jacket. He talked about how hard it was to make that movie and that he wanted to make one in this format since he was a little kid watching spaghetti westerns, he said the f word probably 100 times within the 3 minutes he talked. He was so hyper and passionate he couldn't contain himself, it was like he was more excited to watch his movie than we were just because it was made in a special widescreen format only perfectly suited for a few theatres including this one.

Margot looks hot as always, dig her little disco dance and the quick clip of Brad's casual cruise. Looks like a cult classic already scheduled for a release this summer.

I imagine the following: the actor this and his double who knows why, they are at Sharon's house having a drink or something after a long day, when suddenly the girls of the Manson family appear ... and they It is the weapon of San Quentin (If you are Spanish, you will catch the joke). I keep having that image in my head: dim lighting, some music laughs and suddenly Manson and the girls appear ... to see what happens in the movie.   Even putting as an antecedent the end of inglorius Bastards would not be too far-fetched to think that on that night of glasses is with Sharon and the two protagonists the same Bruce Lee ... who helps defend Sharon from the murderers ...

2019-03-25T21:14:57,"Dear Recipient¬†  We kindly request you to spend a few moments of your time reading this letter because it just might be possible that this letter will open before you a new dimension of your role as a human being in this universe. We hope that you are a free thinking, broadminded, and prejudice-free human being whose goal is to find the truth. Before we continue, let us state to you the purpose of this letter- that this is an introduction and invitation to the way of life known as Islam.    SOME FACTS    Islam has approximately 1 billion followers known as Muslims who follow the final revelation to mankind, known as the ""Qur'an"", revealed to Prophet Muhammad about 1400 years ago. Contrary to the common misconception, only about 20% of all Muslims are Arabs, the rest are Indians, Indonesians, Bosnians,Africans,Chinese,turkish and so on .¬†   WHAT IS ISLAM    Islam, unlike most other religions, is not named after any man. Instead Islam means the submission of one's will to the only true god worthy of worship ""Allah"" and anyone who does so is termed a ""Muslim"". The word also implies ""peace"" which is the natural consequence of total submission to the will of Allah. Islam is the religion that was given to Adam, the first man and the first prophet of Allah, and it was the religion of all the prophets sent by Allah to mankind like Jesus and Moses .¬†   THE MESSAGE OF ISLAM    The most important message of Islam is the absolute Unity of God-that there is only One Supreme Being who has no partners and is not dependent on anyone or anything. He is the creator of everything and the whole universe is under His control. Since the total submission of one's will to Allah represents the essence of worship, Islam is the worship of Allah alone and the avoidance of worship directed to any person, place or thing other than Allah. In essence, Islam calls man away from the worship of creation and invites him to worship only its Creator. Allah is the only one deserving man's worship as it is only by His will that prayers are answered. Hence prayers to the non-living such as the sun, fire, and to humans whether they be Jesus, Moses or even Muhammad are rejected, as Allah informs us in the opening chapter of the Qur'an, known as Soorah Al-Faatihah, verse 4:¬†  ""You alone do we worship and from you alone do we seek help.""  A Muslim believes that Allah and His creation are distinctly different¬† entities. Neither is Allah His creation or a part of it, nor is His creation Him or a part of Him. Ultimately, it is the belief that the essence of Allah is everywhere in His creation or that His divine being is or was present in some aspects of His creation, which has provided justification for the worship of creation. Islam, hence, is a clear call to the worship of the Creator and the rejection of creation-worship in any form.¬†    THE MIRACLE OF QUR'AN    ""And if you are in doubt as to what We [Allah] have revealed‚Ä¶then produce a Soorah (chapter) like thereunto""(Soorah Baqarah 2:23) This was the challenge put forth by Allah in the Qur'an 1400 years ago. As of yet, none has or will ever come close to meeting this challenge. Hence, as a result, multitudes throughout the centuries have believed and continue to believe in the Qur'an as a revelation beyond any human capacity. Modern scientists, for instance, have been amazed by the accuracy of scientific information presented in the Qur'an. Here are just a few examples:¬†  In his book of embryology-'The Developing Human' [W.B. Saunders Publishing, 1982], Dr. Keith Moore added a whole chapter to discuss the scientific accuracy of the Quranic discussion of this science. Another eminent scientist, Dr. Maurice Bucaille wrote in his book-'The Bible, the Qur'an and Science':¬†  ""I could not find a single error in the Qur'an‚Ä¶if a man was the author of the Qur'an how could he have written facts in the 7th century A.D. that today are shown to be in keeping with modern scientific knowledge"" Facts about astronomy, the animal world and other natural phenomenon, that were alien to modern science not long ago, are scattered among the messages of Allah's Unity and His Attributes throughout the miracle that is known as al-Qur'an .",1,0,Saif Kefi,Scf8nIJCvs4,0.08261772241364079,2019-03-25 21:14:57,True,True

2019-04-30T14:38:38,I am genuinely excited but a bit worried for one thing. Like...are they going to show Sharon Tate's murder? Because Roman Polanski is still alive and despite what one may think about him and his controversies it would be weird to show the murder of his wife while he is still living. But then again Tarantino does like to change history like when he killed hitler so it makes me wonder if he's gonna kill the manson cult in this film.

Leonardo, over & over forgetting his non-sensical lines with no background bar patron chatter or atmosphere, like have the bar owners daughter actually come down & play the dam fiddle, anything to make it a little more interesting as this scene dragged on forever !  Why were we first to leave the Playboy mansion just as it was getting fun ?   Following Margo, wondering around aimlessly, like she was lost, in knee high white boots & a black long sleeve sweater, while on the strip, mid-day, bright sunshine summer hot, no wonder she lost the boots once inside the theatre.   Leonardo sweating profusely through out his cowboy scenes in his winter apparel, dyed Custer leather jacket & this heavy purple corduroy pull over sweat-shirt, like the wardrobe lady was playing a joke on him.   Why all the bravado about how we turned the strip into 1969,  L.A with no CGI., then suddenly mix in all this CGI vintage action film footage in Italy or when Leonardo played Steve McQueen, not even remotely realistic looking, in the Great Escape & finally streamline, lengthen the fantastic song choices are just a few obvious suggestions.    Quentin edited 4 hours of film down to 2 hours & 40 minutes, one only wonders what was left on the cutting room floor as Margo never got in the pool at the mansion per the trailer?
