It does nothing for the perception of women in Hollywood, other than annoy people who enjoyed the original film and leave a bad taste in your mouth at some of the awkward writing. Ghostbusters proved this.  The solution to not having enough strong female characters, is to give films a balanced cast that plays off of each character's strengths, rather than having one gender role defer to the other. You want to make another  Oceans film, then why not balance the cast with a few more strong female leads? Rather than going for the stock ""wait I know, what if it was all women.""   Improving women's roles is more about giving them a staging ground amongst other strong male leads, rather than making all the males in the film weak, to try and bolster the perception of the women. It's called nuanced writing, and Hollywood seem to have forgotten how that works, or become too lazy to bother.",2,0,AlexJCorona,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.03369565217391305,2017-12-19 14:36:49,True,True

They aren't some out of left field minority, we're all actually birthed by females, and without them none of us could be here, so why are people surprised when they show up as the lead cast members in films. Also remakes themselves are nothing new (this is actually a spin-off but whatever), we should know by now that Hollywood has run out of ideas and maybe one of the only ways to keep things fresh is to change the gender of the cast. I also understand some peoples apprehensiveness that the movie will just suck, but this isn't by the same people that made Ghostbusters nor is it the same cast, I think with the right direction and cast this can be done right. Now I personally do not have any issue with them making an all-female remake in terms of the fact that I simply couldn't care less about the gender of the actors. I do think however that remakes like this can be more damaging for female equality than they are rewarding - why not make this movie but just call it something different, give it it's own voice? Either way some of the reasons people are bitching is rather silly because I can't see how casting females in something is trying to be politically correct.

Get a grip, the message is not ""Women can/should be able to do everything men do"" or ""We want to make a movie with only female actresses"". Those may be parts of it and yes they benefit the Current feminist wave BUT these films are making you ACTIVELY think about inequality and gender issues simply by watching a trailer, something you wouldn't do with a movie that although has an original idea and interesting female roles is too subtle. Some people prefer subtle and leading by example instead of the constant conversations about the same issues that are being held and posted all over. Personally, I am one of those but at the same time I can see reason in ways that are very obvious about what they're doing and saying as long as it's made in good faith. There are a lot of ways to get to one point and there isn't necessarily a right way, so think about everything form factually correct opinions with thoughtful arguments and challenge your own viewpoint, don't just judge away. We live in an age in which we are being bombarded with these things from everywhere and we don't stop to think that if we didn't have our laptops and information didn't move as freely all around the world, we wouldn't have known about a film, a conversation or a protest for women's issues.",15,5,TheTeta4ever,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.10323593073593074,2017-12-19 19:12:45,True,True

2017-12-19T20:51:12,I think the reason people are pissed is because the oceans series has always had men as the main characters and for them to switch it up makes people angry. if the series always had women as the main characters people wouldn‚Äôt hate it as much. It‚Äôs like doctor who when they made the doctor a woman after years of the main character being a man. I‚Äôd be weird if they made a Star Wars movie where they made Princess Leia a man.

To underline this message you have the catchy tunes of ""these boots are made for walkin"" which is just one of the go-to songs whenever someone wants to showcase strong femininity.   This is pretty bad for two reasons: first, you want these characters to be cool and tough but when the whole movie just becomes about ""showing them men"", the characters start to seem more needy and pathetic.

These famous women live in the lap of luxury, so why are they complaining? They have way more than you and me! My point being, you don't need to look up to famous women to show that you're strong, you need to believe in yourself to be strong. These famous women don't need to lead you, YOU NEED TO LEAD YOURSELF.  So, I hope to all women that you believe in youself and NOT these women, because as powerful and loud of voice as they might have, it's JUST YOU who can make change happen.

Were upset that a series could potentially be tarnished for a cash grab gimmick. Instead just make an original film with an all female cast that shows everyone that woman can do it just as well as men. This just shows a lack of originality and that they have to take something men made great and shove women into the carbon copies of the characters from the original films to make a good female film.

With the right art and comedy direction in addition to the backtracking of the whole feminist movement this has the potential to be a successful reboot.  In more detail however:   I think the casting choice is somewhat risky since most of them seem to cling on there own character persona, such as ""8 Ball"" and ""Card lady"" whom maybe in the finished product might look more 1 directional than initially perceived, To fix this maybe do what they did in  the original and incorporate more character interaction like the older technician and the younger technician in the original.  Clinging to the original is kind of a double edge sword since the original was dependent of characters, of which were so dependent on their actors, Cling less to the format of the original but with the same principles, Ethnic characters in this scenario could be beneficial with good ethnic character development.  One thing that has potential but might be overshadowed is the comedy of course being overshadowed by the heist aspect, Focus on the comedy predominately and let it build both your characters and your heist. In the original they had 13 (14 with arnold schwarzenegger) different characters of which they were able build perfectly.

They can't be bothered to take the time to make new stories with unique and good female or POC roles, they just cheaply look at an existing role and then change its gender or color. It's not giving the proper effort into making a representative/diverse role that these people deserve. It's a cheep way to try and make people happy without even having to lift a finger. Make new and good films with a diverse cast, don't just remake old ones.

Based on the trailer it seems like it could be a fun and interesting heist movie with several very talented actresses, so then why is it a part of the Ocean's franchise and not trying to do its own thing? Because like Ghostbusters and Star Wars, having a pre-established and popular title will already guarantee an audience that will pay money to go see it. As well as trying to create a controversy by casting all women with the sole intent of pushing an agenda and by shitting on its predecessor. Sparking the controversy is a pre-planned move to get the word out and hype up the movie. By doing this, it will get people who love it to see the movie as a way of supporting their beliefs, and it will get people who hate it to see the movie out of curiosity to find reasons for hating it. It's such a fucking shame that we're living in a time where the majority of films being produced are just rehashes made to push an agenda, and not to simply entertain an audience.",9,2,Caleb Becker,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.15910714285714286,2017-12-19 23:38:52,True,True

That's probably why some men arnt to happy with this, because b4 they weren't relating to men they were just enjoying an action movie but now if they do want to watch it, they're gonna have to find a way to look past the "" hey that's a nice dress"" comments and feel like its taking away from the original  (not the60s version btw).

I really wish that people would let movies stand on their own merit. I don't care if you think this is an SJW takeover, or a feminist dream.

2017-12-20T02:06:52,"So a couple of thoughts...  1) Sandra Bullock plays a sibling of Danny Ocean, so technically it‚Äôs not a remake. It‚Äôs a spinoff taking place within the already existing ‚Äòocean‚Äôs universe‚Äô. Matt Damon is even appearing as his character from the original trilogy, undoubtedly to further establish connectivity between the franchises.   2) The studio probably did a spinoff in order to avoid the ‚Äòfemale remake‚Äô label that would associate it with ghostbusters. However it‚Äôs the gender swap that makes people much more angry rather than seeing a remake, so they missed the mark there and surprise surprise the movie is getting hate right out of the gate, and will most likely bomb at the box office regardless of whether or not it is actually good.   3) Though I value equality among men and women, I am not a fan of gender swapped movies. Let me emphasize ‚Äúgender swapped‚Äù. I have absolutely no problem with movies with female leads, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. I just find that gender swapping (in this case an originally all male movie) takes away from the message of ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù (or whatever message the filmmakers want) in exchange for making it Social Commentary: The Movie, and forcefully jamming it down the throats of the viewers. I believe that female led movies would receive much less hate if they were original stories and concepts  or adapted from other female centred works. And it doesn‚Äôt seem to go both ways. I‚Äôd imagine if a gender swapped movie that featured males instead of females were released it would also be torn apart and likely be called sexist. However I don‚Äôt believe in hating movies outright before its been viewed and its quality measured, though we absolutely have the right to be optimistic or doubtful.  4) I personally don‚Äôt think this movie will do well commercially. But it might do alright critically, seeing as ghostbusters got a certified fresh 74% on RT (even though it was terrible). If oceans 8 turns out to be bad i feel it will likely still get good reviews as critics will be afraid of suffering backlash from the public ( likely the case with ghostbusters)  5) despite my skepticism, I really do that hope this movie ends up being genuinely good, and a welcome addition to the oceans series. But again, I‚Äôm doubtful.  These are only my personal opinions, if you agree, cool, if not, that‚Äôs okay too. Let‚Äôs just hope this film turns out well.",0,0,Alvarez RF8,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.0028199932455251573,2017-12-20 02:06:52,True,True

Those trailers looked really cool and the movies were great as well, no not because of a male cast (which is a stupid statement because all three had female characters). Also why tf would I judge a movie based on the genitalia of the actor? Anyways, the reason this looks bad is because they are piggybacking off the old franchise, and the characters seem so forced to be female, it‚Äôs marketing the fact that it‚Äôs an all female cast and they are trying to shove that down your throat. No one likes forced characters, I don‚Äôt think anyone likes the older movies because of the characters genitalia, it‚Äôs that the characters didn‚Äôt have a showing of forced motive, and each one felt alive and different, which made you want to learn more about them.

I'm not in favor of this movement though because it's less about equality and more about being in charge of everything. The Ocean's' movies are classic movies that have starred a diverse cast of men and women. To replace the whole cast with women feels like it's less about a fun movie and more about an agenda.  -The guys complaining about the movie aren't doing it because females. They're doing it because they are fans of the previous movies and they dislike the idea of swapping to an all female cast. They're not ALL misogynists.  -However, I do notice that a lot of the females in the comments are completely misandrist. Not all of them are, but it seems like if you post something negative, it's "" man tears, hehhehe"" or something of the sort.   -Would you like it if Juno was remade with an all homosexual male cast?

Instead of making an original movie with original characters they just take movies from the past which already have an amazing story and memorable characters and just replace them with women with the exact same characteristics. And women are acting as if this is their first time seeing women in lead roles like where have you been, there are tons of strong female characters in movies but ya'll are acting as if we've never seen them before. And stop blaming men when these movies don't do well or arent receive well some of us women hate it too and its almost degrading to think just replacing a male character with a female character will be just as good.

They are trying so hard to push this equality crap so much these days, and it's not just movies it's pretty much in everything including video games. It's fucking annoying. IF women were so equal to men, how come I don't see women MMA fighters fighting Male MMA fighters? It's because even though some of those women can fight, if one of those dudes hit them at full force even once in the face, their asses is going straight down to the mat. And why hasn't any of the women basketball teams ever had any one as dominant and legendary as Jordan, Pippin, Rodman,  Barkley? Johnson? As a matter of fact, why don't we just put women NFL players on the field and see how hard they can really hit and knock over a guy twice their size, because unless she's a body builder she's going to get killed. Equality is horseshit and always will be.   These films always have women overpowering men in the most unrealistic ways possible and beating the living shit out of them. Women should just stick to what they know best, porn movies. Lord knows they have more than enough worthless whores involved in that line of work the minute they turn 18 years old.

Which is a shame, because I pretty much despise where female culture has been in that respect.

2017-12-20T08:24:16,"The comments section shows the degradation of humanity.  The very idea of a movie starring women is so offensive to some men they have to go out of their way to ruin it, just like they did with ghostbusters.  If you aren't threatened by the social change that brought about all female remakes then why are you wasting your time commenting here?  No one was threatened when Clooney was recast in a role made famous by Frank Sinatra, but if Sandra Bullock does it, people's minds explode!  Do you think they didn't make changes between the Sinatra version and the Clooney version?  Of course they did!  It was a completely different thing and yet no one cared.  It's fine to do whatever you want with a remake, just so long as you don't cast women in formally male roles, that's a bridge too far . . . what a bunch of sexist hypocrites.    You don't have a leg to stand on to be legitimately annoyed with this movie.  If you like heist movies it looks good, if you don't it looks bad.  End of story.  But people who don't like heist movies aren't watching this trailer because they aren't interested in the movie itself.  So if you hate heist movies and you're here, bashing it for having the gall to recast a movie with women, then just be honest about why you're here and why you're hating on it.  You're hating on it because you either hate women or don't give a fuck about women, to the point you won't even watch a movie that stars women.  That makes you a sexist.    If you're wasting your time posting around about this movie that makes you a sexist, an asshole and a horrible human being.",0,0,harveythepooka,MFWF9dU5Zc0,-0.05625,2017-12-20 08:24:16,True,True

Following an effective but costly counterattack led by¬†Poe Dameron, the Resistance vessels jump into hyperspace to escape, but the First Order follows using a tracking device.¬†Kylo Ren, Leia's son, destroys the Resistance support fighters, but hesitates to fire at the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother's presence.¬†TIE fightersdestroy the bridge of the ship, killing several Resistance leaders and incapacitating Leia, leaving¬†Vice Admiral Holdo¬†in command. Disapproving of Holdo's passive strategy, Poe,¬†Finn,¬†BB-8, and mechanic¬†Rose Tico¬†embark on a secret plan to disable the tracking device.  Meanwhile,¬†Rey¬†has arrived on remote¬†Ahch-To¬†with¬†Chewbacca¬†and¬†R2-D2¬†aboard the¬†Millennium Falcon¬†to recruit¬†Luke Skywalker¬†to the Resistance. Disillusioned by the failures of the Jedi, Luke initially refuses, even after learning of¬†Han Solo's death. Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey and Kylo begin communicating with each other through telepathic visions. Prompted by R2-D2, Luke eventually agrees to teach Rey the ways of¬†the Force. Luke and Kylo give Rey differing accounts of the incident that turned Kylo to the dark side, with Luke confessing that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that¬†Supreme Leader Snoke¬†had corrupted him, causing Kylo to destroy Luke's emergent Jedi Order in retaliation. Convinced that Kylo can still be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To to confront Kylo without Luke. Luke prepares to burn down the Ahch-To Jedi temple and library, but he encounters¬†Yoda's Force ghost, who destroys the temple himself and encourages Luke to learn from his failure.  Holdo reveals her plan to discreetly evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transports. Believing her actions to be cowardly and risky, Poe instigates a mutiny. Finn, Rose and BB-8 travel to Canto Bight and acquire the help of the hacker¬†DJ, who says he is able to help them disable the tracking device. They infiltrate Snoke's ship, but are captured by¬†Captain Phasma, though BB-8 manages to escape. Meanwhile, Rey lands on the ship, and Kylo brings her to Snoke, who reveals that he controlled the mental connection between her and Kylo as part of a plan to destroy Luke. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and works together with Rey to kill Snoke's guards. Kylo invites Rey to rule the galaxy with him, but Rey refuses. Using the Force, they struggle for possession of¬†Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber, which splits in two.  A recovered Leia stuns Poe, allowing the evacuation to begin. Holdo remains on the ship to mislead Snoke's fleet as all others attempt to flee to a nearby old¬†Rebel Alliancebase on¬†Crait. However, DJ reveals the Resistance's plan to the First Order, and the evacuation transports are targeted with heavy losses; Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming Snoke's fleet at lightspeed to stop the barrage. Rey escapes in the chaos, while Kylo declares himself new Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose, who escape after defeating Captain Phasma, and join the survivors of the evacuation on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose lead a charge with old¬†speeders. Rey draws the TIE fighters away with the¬†Falcon, while Rose saves Finn from a suicide run against the main enemy cannon, which blasts a hole in the Resistance fortress.  Luke appears and confronts Kylo alone so that the surviving Resistance fighters can escape. Kylo orders the First Order forces to fire on Luke to no effect, then engages Luke in battle himself. Kylo strikes Luke twice with his lightsaber, only to learn that he has been fighting Luke's Force¬†projection. Luke defiantly tells Kylo that he will not be the last Jedi, while Rey uses the Force to help the remaining Resistance fighters escape via the¬†Falcon. Back on Ahch-To, an exhausted Luke peacefully dies and becomes one with the Force. Leia reassures everyone that the rebellion has all that is needed to rise again. On Canto Bight, one of the children that helped Finn and Rose escape grabs a broom with the Force and gazes hopefully up into space.",0,0,James Har_en's free throw attempts,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.0883107389686337,2017-12-20 08:39:15,True,True

I‚Äôve never personally met a man who was attracted to a weak woman or did not enjoy watching strong female roles. The reason people are frustrated is because it has become obvious to them when a plot and casting has been purposely devised in order to appease political agenda and political correctness to the detriment of artistic quality.  We can tell when something is forced or pushed on us. Compare the strong female lead in Star Wars Rogue One who kicks butt without having to prove anything, against the Rey character of the Force Awakens shaking away Finn‚Äôs hand when he tries to pull her to safety, Captain Phantasma character written as male and changed to female, Andy Serkis talking about Snoke‚Äôs fear of a feminine power. This is when the agenda poisons the art and true creativity, and leads it away from the story to be told and into our contemporary societal issues.  When I write a story, the female characters kick ass because that‚Äôs what appeals to me and that is what my male characters find attractive, like Lagertha in Vikings- I don‚Äôt like the useless, pretty princess, I like the shield maiden who can hold her own. But I don‚Äôt put pen to paper feeling that I must write a character as such and such, because then it‚Äôs not my story, it becomes someone else‚Äôs. Truly strong female characters have nothing to prove...... that‚Äôs real empowerment - not needing to force your ego or point upon others in order to prove anything, because you know what you are and are not insecure.

If you like vanilla ice cream so be it but just because they bring out a chocolate one isn't something worth bitching over.

Oceans 11 with Clooney etc.¬†Is a love story that involved Clooney¬†enlisting his con friends into doing something, robbing a casino,¬†that would result in him getting his love back. It wasn't marketed as ""A male movie""...it simply had characters portraying cool criminals.   Last time I checked the stats - armed robbery, theft, fraud - was a male dominated game. So seems accurate.  The women who appear in the Clooney led Ocean films, are either super talented art dealers - Julia Roberts or anti-fraud pro's¬†and daughter of legendary thief¬†- Catherine Zeta Jones,¬†FBI or¬†CIA - Matt Damon's mom character. Then we have Al Pacinos hotel and casino manager/PA¬†who was played by Ellen Barkin. So, no women portrayed as anything other than successful in their field, who hold positions of power and authority. Also no women whom we can view as evil or¬†wrong - benedict, Willie, The Night¬†Fox.  ¬†Yet we now have the assumption that those films were purely made to be enjoyed by males, and are sexist.   I fear¬†Oceans 8¬†will turn into an oestrogen driven man hating movie, where Sandra Bullock will¬†get one over on the¬†""man"" who wronged her. with mommy jokes and duckling to swan scene included. However,¬†its unlike Ghostbusters,¬†in that it¬†doesn't appear to¬†be the ""selling point"" that it is a female remake¬†film, the heist seems to be the focus, they just happen to be women. So its positive so far.  Hopefully, they can churn out an entertaining and good film. They certainly have the cast to make it good. Minus Corden.

It was a reboot based off of the classic Ghostbusters but with full on woman replacing men. Feminism does exist with some movies (etc.), but Wonder Woman was already her own thing, she doesn't try to reboot a man or men. WW is pretty OP in the new DC movies but at least they don't go off rubbing it in your face. With Justice League, that wasn't the case even though that movie wasn't so amazing (if anyone gets me) because of Bruce being the reliable one to make the team. In WW, it was her movie and in Justice League, she didn't take too much of the spotlight. WW is a pretty decent film whether high praise or not, compared to the other recent live action DC movies. So those men trying to make a point should just quit it. feminists who call themselves ""woman"" should make a name for themselves instead of rebooting ""men"". Not trying to target anyone but it is seriously an issue that supposedly fixes a problem but creates another.

The East Asian girl who is a poor kleptomaniac and a street hustler going against all Asian stereotypes.

The fashion designer that's about to lose her wealth because of a coincidental event<didn't even try.  In Oceans eleven the heist made sense, they stole cold hard cash, untraceable.

Now I have no problem with female leads, Atomic Blond is an amazing movie and one of my favorite spy movies ever, but what we see from this trailer is the fact that they only made this an Oceans movie without any men just to say the same thing as what the  ghost busters were going for.  If you want to do a heist movie with an all female cast then go for it but don't try to make it a political statement by doing an unneeded carry on  of an already good series that wasn't hinted at or even mentioned.  Just do a good movie that happens to have most of it's cast female, don't make it about the fact they are a female version of a pre-existing  franchise, which is what they are clearly doing.    And that's why people aren't looking forward to this movie.  Btw I am probs gonna watch it cause this isn't that bad of a trailer, besides it being an unneeded Oceans movie and I am missing a good heist movie aaannd it could be good, but i just wanted to explain why people are mad. =)",0,0,TheNoblePeasant IsBest,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.191,2017-12-20 15:02:14,True,True

If you're not a fan of multiple sequels or spin-offs or you just think it was unnecessary to revisit this universe, that's totally valid but if it's purely for the reason that this main cast is female and you would otherwise enjoy it if it wasn't, maybe you have some re-evaluating to do. Hollywood revisits cinematic universes all the time to cash in on the popularity of a franchise. Multiple/belated sequels and spin-offs are not a new thing.

Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet¬≠to¬≠be¬≠dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúROBUX‚Äù).

In contrast to:  The Fate of the Furious, The Magnificent Seven, The Hitman's Bodyguard, American Assassin, American Made, The Accountant, The Foreigner, Just Getting Started, The Dark Tower, Transformers: The Last Knight, Baywatch, King Arthur, The Mummy, Overdrive, 6 Days, Acts of Vengeance, First Kill, xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Unlocked, 24 Hours to Live, Wheelman, Cops and Robbers, Dunkirk, Hacksaw Ridge, Batman vs Superman, pretty much every marvel movie, Assassins Creed, Sausage Party, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, 13 Hours, The Nice Guys, Gods of Egypt...  I could go on for literally days but you get the idea. Note that I'm taking about major blockbusters with a MAJORITY female cast (not just one female character solely there to break up the sausage fest and mostly get killed or kidnapped to give wonder bread protagonist something to angst and grit his teeth over) that have major studio backing, star power, and decent marketing. I'm not saying this is 100% going to be awesome (it's not out yet- so people shouldn't be assuming the opposite either) but movies like this are important to lift up, because they're already starting at a lower level than every other snarky white-guy lead action/heist movie out there because you already have many a douchebag dissing it because they're under some vague impression that women are trying to ""take over"" something that's ""theirs"" by trying to do what they've been doing to decades.",0,0,Drama Vin,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.14841991341991342,2017-12-20 20:09:34,True,True

2017-12-20T22:46:14,Why is this a thing? It should never be a thing because just replacing the main characters from male to female does not show you support women issues or some stupid shit you are trying to push but just making people hate you and hate the content you create. I struggle to watch a Warner bros movie because they push this feminist agenda where in the end I can find females as lead roles entertaining but that is original roles and not some shitty remake of a classic . Also I find the best movies have a dynamic of gender roles and that is what makes them good and in the end the majority of women do fall under a stereotyped role and that is not bad to acknowledge and say but also push that they can be strong and knowledgeable just don‚Äôt force it and that is why the WB movies of late have been getting shat on. In my opinion in this day and age extreme feminism pushes a fascist movement and has moved away from promoting women‚Äôs equality to the oppression of men and comb8ned with that joining with non binary and the lgbtq community to further oppress the straight white make because he is so bad and oppressing where in the end some women enjoy certain treatment and som don‚Äôt just as me have a vast amount of personality‚Äôs and character types.

Or women are so catty they would never be able to work together in a group on a big complicated project like that. Or women wouldn't go through that trouble for money, they would just take the money from their husbands, and if they really wanted a bank heist they would make just their husbands do it. Or women aren't really able to think outside the box so they could never come up with a scheme like this on their own. Or women aren't even funny, why would I watch them talk on screen for 2 hours. Or women are going to ruin this movie just like they did the beloved Ghostbusters franchise, just so Hollywood can feel like they did something to appease feminists. But I disagree with all that, I think women are capable of doing things well. When I go to a retail store I see women fold shirts and pants in ways that I never ever could. It makes me think that women do have some skills and talents, some maybe that even men dont have.

No. There are so, so, so many mediocre, shitty, generic movies like this with all-male casts that still get praise because y'all eat it up. Just look at previous shitty Ocean's movies.

If women (and men) who support female growth in the industry actually cared rather than just get on their high horse.. you'd want films like Alien, Atomic Blonde, Star Wars, Wonder Woman etc. Not this shit and stuff like Ghostbusters. All this is doing is using a male dominated film's name to try sell a movie filled with women. It's plot looks basic and the film is just selling itself on the fact it's women. This sort of shit just hurts women in the industry.  Bringing out ensemble comedy films with all female casts won't change the film/TV industry or popular opinion. Films should be made on what's a good story, male or female irrelevant.

So you had to make an all female one because the Ocean's Eleven (the only one that matters) didn't have females in it? Why not just take a similar cast and make an original idea? For the people that say, ""Well, I don't think this has anything to do with the 'Ocean's' movies."" Really? It's in the title, with a different number, and it's based on the same exact concept: a group of professional thieves come together to rip off something super valuable. And to the people who say, ""you just don't want women to do movies like these."" Untrue, in fact most fans loved Charlize Theron from The Italian Job for example. Her character fit perfectly in that story. There's plenty of movies out there with male leads that we(men) take a huge shit on because it sucks; the idea sucks, the direction sucks, the cast sucks. Just getting tired of Hollywood looking for ""woman power"" movies. We (men) loved Sigourney Weaver of Alien(s), Linda Hamilton of The Terminator series, Carrie Anne Moss of The Matrix, Uma Thurman of Kill Bill, etc. So it's not about hating on women, it's about Hollywood basically remaking old greats but recasting with all females for the purpose of pushing feminism.

2017-12-21T23:49:18,"This is so sad. Women have had tons of awesome female characters, in action, drama, comedy, etc. All these reboots-with-women movies just give the impression to people that women can't do cool things without nabbing a story from a different, male-led, franchise, while there've been plenty of good examples of this stretching back (probably far, far more, but this is purely my limited movie watching experience) to at least Alien in 1979. Plenty of recent examples from English-language to foreign. just in the last few years. People seem extra whiny about action stars which bugs me because, yeah they're movies, but I have to point out that that just statistically, it's more likely for a guy to be in those sorts of roles, both in wanting to do action movies as actors, and as characters, where men are more likely to be involved in this sort of thing in real life, so here's some strong, female-led/co-led films right off the top of my head, both in English and abroad, examples of non-pandering, believable female character who aren't just ""women being men."" Truth is that women are different to men, but no less brave, daring, and intelligent. More movies should acknowledge this difference, which doesn't prevent them from being badass. Here's some off the top of my head (dozens I'm doubtless missing, just from  last few years, but I''m not  going  to make this post longer than it is already going to be.  Feel free to post others to contribute.  Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017 (better get an Oscar nom)) The Villainess (2017, South Korea) The Handmaiden (2016, Soth Korea) The Neon Demon ( 2016) Hush (2016) 10, Cloverfield Lane (2016) Arrival (2016) Raw (2016 (okay I haven't seen it but looks awesome and people loved it) Room (2015) Anomalisa (2015 (robbed of Oscar for animated film by Inside Out)) The Assassin (2015, China) Assassination (2015, South Korea) Ex Machina (2014 (It's a robot but AI so I count it) Gone Girl (2014) The Babadook (2014) Proxy (2013) Prometheus ( 2012 (fuck you I liked it) Melancholia (2011) The Host (2006, Soth Korea) Lady Vengeance (2005, South Korea) KILL FUCKING BILL (2003, 2004) Monster (2003) Joint Security Area (2000, South Korea) Three Colors Trilogy (1993--1994, Fench. Polish) Silence of the Lambs (1991)  I could go on and on and on and on with movies before the dates I listed, as well as movies in between the most recent years. Just make something original; I'm no feminist, but it's so much better for both movie quality and the perception of women's opportunities in the industry (which would satisfy -- as in shut up -- feminists on the subject).

2017-12-22T02:11:32,"I'm really worried about this film not being any good. Just based on the trailer, it seems like it doesn't have the same style, themes, or mood that the trilogy did, which is why I think it looks like it really shouldn't be an Oceans movie. It looks as if it would be absolutely great as a standalone film in its own universe, just not as a part of the Oceans series.  I really really really want it to be well made, as I want all the films under the Oceans series name to be good, but the fact that Danny is dead is a huge turn off for me. The chemistry that the original cast had was absolutely perfect for those films and the mood they had. I'm curious to see if the cast of this one can keep up with that. There's no doubt that they've got a lot of great A-list actors in it, but just because they're great actors doesn't mean they're a great fit for the film, and I would really like to see them portray their roles well.  All in all, I'm not all that excited about an Oceans film without George Clooney/Danny Ocean as the main character, but I'll be willing to give it a watch after it's left the theater. If I hear that it's really good when it comes out, I'll be a lot more inclined to see it in the Cinema. Here's to hoping that they execute this film well, and that it doesn't become another disappointing attempt at a series revival.",0,0,Rabbit Hill,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.3443910256410256,2017-12-22 02:11:32,True,True

The world will never understand this. The world doesn't want to understand this, and they will intentionally not understand it.  They will do everything in their power to point at other supposed 'fixes' that will somehow cure the ills of society, but they never work. They weren't meant to. It would like to tell you everything wrong with you though. Despite all the 'progress' made supposedly by Hollywood and social activists, they have missed the mark. We are the most angry, depressed, violent and unloving people at the same time being the most 'woke' and ever ready to call someone out on their dislike of other races, their sexism, their phobias, their money.

Quite the opposite.  And that is why men respected the characters of Sarrah Connor in the 1+2 Terminator and Ripley in Alien 1+2. Because the werent model makeupped mary sue fools presented as alpha and omega just because they had vaginas. Its what basic c*nts and c*cks just cant grasp. Its beyond them.

Explain then how come men have widely apreciated and glorified the Sarrah Connor and Eleanor Ripley female MAIN characters in the original Terminator 1&2 and Alien 1&2. THE DEFINING movies of theire genre! Because men vere not sexist back then? So now men are more sexist? NO YOU TWATS! Because those characters were structured and had developement! Simply putting a vagina in a movie and shaming men for not apreciating it will give you a bad movie and no $$$ That is why ghostbusters flunked and why this shit will flunk!

But if you think harder about it, this isn't nearly as cynical a cash-grab.  Oh sure, it's trying to use the Ocean's name for brand-recognition, but (1) Ocean's has never been as beloved a cultural phenomenon as Ghostbusters to begin with, so that makes this easier to accept, and (2) Ocean's doesn't hinge on balancing two very different genres like Ghostbusters does with horror and comedy (and which the 2016 film failed spectacularly at).  Ocean's have always just been heist movies, and their most distinct quality is that they're way bigger team-ups than most heist movies are (though The Sting would beg to differ, even if that's more of a con movie than a heist movie XD).  So as long as it works as a heist movie, this'll be just fine.  This isn't some ""betrayal"" of the series, guys, and Ghostbusters didn't strictly fail because the team was all-female.  It failed because Sony had no bucking clue how to make a Ghostbusters movie and did the most boring and predictable things they could with the cast they had.  So give this one a chance, it already looks a million times more interesting than Ghostbusters 2016 ever did.",0,0,Batbrony,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.09027777777777779,2017-12-23 06:17:13,True,True

The only missing parts are how they went through with the plan and where the characters will end up doing after the job is inevitably done. The woman from AHS at 1:22 will probably end up returning home and acting like nothing ever happened. The movie will also try to make you think the heist failed. But don't worry! This will be explained near the end of the movie! That, and the special cameo that we don't know about yet. Probably George Clooney.. This'll take place when they're explaining the heist to someone (In reality for the audience, so we can get flashbacks to see how they did stuff they didn't explain before, as they're explaining it) at a cafe/park or something along those lines. They'll reveal how a stranger during the heist was in fact one of the celebrities from the original movies and without that persons actions the plan would've failed for realsies. Then they show (probably) Clooney sittin' there with Bullock smiling like ""Yup. I was actually the master behind this all along!"" Then they ride off somewhere happy as f*** and queue the end music as the car drives towards the setting horizon. Either that, or the Baby Driver ending scene (trying not to spoil).  *EDIT*  Looked up this movie on IMDB. Matt Damon is in it, so maybe he'll be the cameo/part of the plan!

Second of all this main character is danny oceans ex con sister which they said in the trilogy before this  Third of all ghostbusters reboot is science fiction film about saving the world fro  ghost. ""Ooh they have to save the world from ghost cool"" (sarcasm) not many people mainly female but men as well would watch this kind of science fiction film. Whereas oceans 8 is probably comdey but is crime, thiller about 7 people going on a heist. This can happen in real life. More people would probably watch this kind of film rather than films like ghostbusters or the reboot.  Fourth of all they only did on film with a female version and know you complain the next movie to have a female version is being feminist. Fuck you people think that this is feminist or the next movie that is female version says that it is feminist.

That's the image i get from this trailer that you need to steal an idea made by men, and you can't think of your own original idea.  Ok bare with me i'm just working off of real historical events and real life for how to make your own original ideas  What if you had it take place in modern day Saudi Arabia where women have almost no rights, sometimes cattle have more rights and maybe a group of women want revenge. Maybe some woman who married into a wealthy family, maybe her husband dies. She is discarded as trash and she forms up an all female group to get some revenge and steal the money back. Since all women in this area are treated as less than dirt, it makes perfect sense for their to be such a focus on all women  but if thats not socially acceptable enough for snowflakes Ok fine  Lets go back to 50s America where women are expected to be straight, white, and the perfect obedient good house wives. Only existing to please men and pump out children for them. How about we center the movie on a lesbian woman who lost everything from some rich white jackass who either raped her or used her and then tossed her away like garbage. Now she wants revenge and is going to form a team up to steal all his wealth. Again this would fit in for the current time period with how little rights women had around this time and were treated more as servants. Plus that's just straight white women. Black women, asian women, gay women had it far worse  Or finally heres idea three China has always hated their women. See the One Child Policy. Even in modern day China, they see their women as breeding animals with little rights. It's not as bad as Saudi Arabia but they are put at a severe disadvantage to men, expected to be submissive/ weak/ inferior/ subservient to men in all aspects. What if you have a woman who her entire life she was controlled. Told where to go what to do where to eat how many children to have, completely controlled until she eventually got so fed up that she now is lashing back. Its all about her say fighting against the government trying to steal from them and joined by other women being treated terribly. To get the Chinese theater vote you could instead have it be Taiwan knowing China would approve more then  There. That is THREE ideas. THREE UNIQUE IDEAS you can use which would all work instead of nah bitches be too fucking stupid, they are dumb sluts that need to go and steal men's ideas to have any real ideas of their own you want to make a pro feminine heist movie, use one of those three ideas. At least those three ideas wouldnt feel like a complete rip off of an existing male franchise",7,3,NPC 100573200,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.09867149758454104,2017-12-29 21:41:45,True,True

Because I guess they figure woman like shiny things, so lets have them steal jewelry. Not patronizing at all... Next, why is this an Ocean's film to begin with? Why not just make a simple Heist movie with women and call it something else? Answer: They wanted to the namebrand and the controversy.  The makers of this film don't give a shit about equal representation. They want a quick buck by piggybacking off an established franchise and the free publicity from the outrage.

Look at Ghostbusters,  the whole movie was centered around the fact it had women cast,  rather than just writing a good movie.   But let's ask go deeper.  What does it say about Hollywood's interpretation of feminism that they don't give a cast like this their own franchise to build on,  and instead pass an already established one.   Could it be Hollywood doesn't think these women can hold up their own franchise on name and talent alone and are instead looking to bank on the Ocean's 11 name to get people in theatres rather than genuine interest in an all female ensemble cast with an original story?.",2,1,TheChekan,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.38125000000000003,2017-12-31 13:10:06,True,True

Rebecca Buck - Tank Girl Ripley - Alien Sarah connor - Terminator Wonder Woman Captain Marvel (looks awesome even before release so i'm adding it xD) Alice - Resident Evil (the first few are good films) The Bride - Kill Bill Hit-Girl - Kick-Ass (easily needs a solo movie) Trinity from the Matrix (and they are talking sequels so she could easily hold a solo movie herself) Princess leia - Star Wars (did she really ever feel like a background character who couldn't take care of herself?)  These are just from my favourite movies that have female main characters that I thought kicked ass, I could never see a man taking up these characters roles, but hey if you want to swap some genders fine but do it right, starbuck in the reboot of battlestar galactica was great because it was written so well and the franchise had been dead for decades, it had its devoted fanbase but it was far from it's millions, but they didn't gender swap everyone for the sake of it they thought it through,   like the ghostbusters... while saying it is still in the same universe ""in the 80s 4 scientists"" then making all the new female characters basically just like the original characters in terms of backgrounds, spengler..... but not related to egon? dana... as some crazy scientist woman with an accent.. using the original actors but not as there original characters and killing one off (likely because it was obvious murray wanted nothing to do with anymore of the movies which is why he alone halted the production of a ghostbusters 3 almost his whole life) it was just a mess of pointlessness with callbacks and constant saturday night live adlibbing... I know the original actors all worked on SNL but the comedy the did on there was far from the dry comedy used in the original ghostbusters.  Anyway i've ranted on WAY too long for a comment on a simple sequel movie and I feel like a bit of a cun.t for that but hey maybe many feel the same way, from the likes to dislikes i'm guessing so, and I doubt all of them are men as plenty of women see how bad some of these movies are becoming to it isn't a sex thing...... I guess it's a movie lovers thing.  Peace.",0,0,Jax Dagger,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.17544664330378618,2018-01-05 04:31:03,True,True

If they know what you are pulling, they would be turning in their graves. Make Quality movies. Bring MASCULINITY back to Life. Or you will lose more Business to Asia.

You Yanks have the Federal Reserve enslaving you as well through your birth certificate, usury, contracts, and perpetual debt. Your country is being influenced by the economics of the UK and U.S. whether you like to believe it or not. So what does any of what I said above have to do with this trailer? The elite created Hollywood to manipulate, distract, and brainwash society.  Hollywood films have long been used to promote social engineering, wars, political propaganda, ethnic tensions, and religious tensions. Remember that the Hollywood studios and people have no loyalty to you.  If you don't believe that ask a Hollywood studio or celebrity for money to pay your bills.  Ocean's 8 is more psychological operations financed by the elite to advance social engineering efforts. If you don't believe me look at how much controversy and arguments the Ghostbusters: Answer the Call film and the new Star Wars trilogy have created. The elite want females and males fighting against each other. Although the elite created feminism, the elite enjoy seeing feminists argue amongst themselves too. The elite like to keep us divided so we cannot fight them. The elite use ethnic differences, religious beliefs, political beliefs, gender warfare, etc to keep us divided. When I see a young child or baby I feel that they do not deserve to grow up to be slaves.  We were all born free and given dominion over this Earth as sentient human beings. Let us give a promising future to our children and future generations of this Earth. Stop supporting the elite and stop playing their game. The only thing the elite have is their fiat currency and systems of usury to keep us controlled and enslaved.

Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett have been using a new skin beauty treatment in which the cells derived from a circumcised newborn baby boy's penis foreskin is cloned and then used on their faces for skin enhancement. Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett joke about their beauty treatment by referring to it as a ""penis facial"". This is appalling and these women are disgusting privileged psychopaths! Any circumcision is genital mutilation! Of course society decries female circumcision, but no one cares when male baby boy's are subjected to the mental and physical pain caused by circumcision.  Male circumcision can also cause many problems when the circumcised boys grow older. Stop supporting these Hollywood films and the people involved in making these films. Actors and actresses are just overpaid glorified thespians that we do not need in our lives. Hollywood is home of the pedophiles, rapists, and promiscuous psychopaths.

2018-06-06T17:54:43,"First of all, this series didn't need to exist past the first film. They all followed the same exact formula and weren't very interesting to watch after the first. Basically boils down to, two characters decide to pull a radical heist, they have to recruit talent for each scenario in the form of a montage, they train for the heist montage, they perform the heist montage, it appears as though they fail the heist to add artificial stakes, they reveal information to the audience the writers intentionally kept from them so they can pull off an unexpected twist to show how they were successful. BOOM! Ocean's movie. Predictable and doesn't carry an entire franchise. Even worse is how the film's design is to show you every plan for the heist except the most important one that will guarantee their success. It's a cheap plot twist that relies on withholding information rather than misdirection and smart writing.  Secondly, while I'm not against an all female cast, this one in particular makes no sense. There is literally no reason for their team to be made up of entirely women especially during the recruitment process because pulling off a large scale heist that requires precision timing and experts in their respective roles means you hire the right person for the job because of their skill, not their gender. I'm all for equality but that means assimilation not segregation. You want to promote female diversity in film? Cast more women in your project along side the males. Otherwise this is forced feminism catering to one audience over the other.  It's the same reason why I think BET is a stupid channel. Having an all black channel and an all black awards show promotes segregation. Why would we come this far just to go backwards? We keep talking about equality but no one actually wants to put forth the effort in assimilation. They all want their own things. So we have the women's channel, black channel, Latino channel, Korean channel. We can't keep creating little entertainment pockets that cater to one audience. That is literally the exact opposite of equality.",1,0,Justin Jimenez,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.06512550756736805,2018-06-06 17:54:43,False,True

Week after week it became clear that Ghostbusters: Answer the Call would flop, and the media no longer tried to hype the film. Of course Cate Blanchett's character is a lesbian in this film. And how can Warner Bros. call this film a spin-off when it's clearly a rehashed feminized version of Ocean's 11 and Ocean's Eleven? Ocean's 8 is cash grab gender politics propaganda promoting lesbianism and women's supremacy. This film is a insult to women and it is a direct attack on society. Stop supporting these social engineering propaganda films financed by the elite. We do not need Hollywood or these glorified thespians who live like kings for playing pretend in front of camera. Remember that Warner Bros. owns 30% of Rotten Tomatoes.  Also know that just about everything you read and hear is owned by the elite.

The same is true of Ocean‚Äôs 8. This is a stellar ensemble of eminently watchable actresses who are all having a blast. Yes, Sandra Bullock is playing the sister of Danny Ocean but that‚Äôs so tangential that it really doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is Bullock‚Äôs confidence and unflappable coolness.""  BS Ocean's was always about the characters each of them were played an integral part that makes the story more intriguing. We aren't watching it because who the actors (or PC SJW reboots in Ocean's 8 case) we are watching it because the actors fit the characters that were developed. We shouldn't just force a gender swap because it's 2018.  TLDR Ocean's is supposed to be a fun action movie that makes you care about the story and I haven't watched these movies just because they are action movies.

2018-06-15T15:16:36,"HEY HOLLYWOOD HERE IS HOW YOU WRITE AN ORIGINAL STORY      women creatures... they ruin everything..... they dont build and create new ideas... they brake men down with constant whinging/complaining and victim-hood delusions and then parasitically extract the resources, happiness, and soul of their weakened victim. once they have extracted what they want.... they promptly proceed to ruin it and/or destroy its value via the injection of their  ingrained narcissism and complete contempt for logic and reason. Then when all that is left is the hollow remains of wombs, men,children, film franchises, academic centres, marriages, families, economies and civilisation, the woman creature simply and rapidly moves on with utter indifference to locate another host organism/society.  Since the dawn of humanity the destructive force of nature that is the woman creature was controlled and somewhat contained by a far superior lifeform know collectively as the ""builders and thinkers"" or ""men"". While vastly stronger, faster, smarter and harder working than the woman creature, the builders and thinkers integrity was often compromised by the urge for companionship  and mating and would often be destroyed trying to compromise with the woman creature by offering to support and maintain its never ending demands with the fruits of its hard labour, industriousness and intellect.... but it was futile,  as the man would only embolden the woman creatures devious machinations and fall victim to a fate worse than death....  Also hindering the builders and thinkers in their struggle with the woman creatures was their need to make sense and base their action and discourse on facts and reality, this put them at a disadvantage against the woman creatures unpredictable, nonsensical outbursts of blithering and tears which would almost always escalate to the women creatures weaponized use of menstrual blood and rape accusations against the host builder and thinker for mere inconveniences...... real or imagined.  The first major conflict between the two beings occurred 11 minutes after the dawn of man, when the women creatures spent $600 of the builders hard earned assets on a haircut and shoes knowing full well the car rego was due in 2 days. When pressed buy the builders and thinkers as to why they did this, the women creatures erupted in tears, blamed systemic oppression and accused a lunar eclipse of racism. overwhelmed by stupidity and questioning their sanity, many of the smarter builders and thinkers retreated to damo's house for a beer while many of the more foolhardy stayed on in the hopes of finding a resolution with the women creatures and where quickly destroyed by false claims of domestic violence and restraining orders...... there were no survivors.  While this conflict was seen by both sides as a major loss for the builders and thinkers that where already depleted from 97% of workplace deaths...... nature proved it to be anything but.....  With the builders and thinkers sheltered from alimony and manipulation at damo's house, the women creatures found themselves lacking any host organisms capable of sustaining their existence. having squandered any remaining resources captured during the conflict on a treadmill they will never use and more shoes, the women creatures quickly turned on one another. forming small gangs known as ""best friends forever"" the women creatures attacked others with bitchiness and vindictive gossip in order to extract sustenance from the suffering of others and inflate their own ego..... before turning on fellow gang members hours later.  Within 3 days the women creature population was decimated. Lacking the ability to make rational decisions and take responsibility for their own well being they floundered in the wilderness, many simply fell to the elements while others, starved of attention and souls bought a bunch of cats and died alone.  Only the most callous and self-centred women creatures survived this period by consuming the fetal tissue and soul of their partial birth abortions.  meanwhile at damo's house the builders and thinkers had been enjoying a golden age of peace, hobbies, fun and genuine friendship. however, felling a instinctual obligation to explore and harness the world around them, many builders and thinkers wished to leave damo's house and re-take the tampon riddled wasteland from the women creatures. Thus began the great leap forward for the builders and thinkers, using reason, science, hard work and not complaining all the time the builders and thinkers invented a powerful artefact which they called ""everything""  With the invention of ""everything"" every aspect of the builders lives improved exponentially. in a few short years they had tripled their life expectancy, cured diseases, set a code of laws, landed a man on the moon and harnessed electricity and the elements. soon they were ready to venture out and spread their great work across the wasteland of the women creature, confident that their new found understanding of everything could counter the narcissistic instability of any surviving women creatures...........how wrong they were........   END OF PART ONE.  so what do you think warner bros.? next years box office smash? does it need more leftard identity politics? ill take a check i was thinking  hillary cilnton for lead woman creature.... you reckon she would take the role for 77 cents? can you place a order at planed parenthood for props?  call my agent on 1800-FEMINISM-IS-CANCER",0,3,FemtardNpc,MFWF9dU5Zc0,0.10579405162738495,2018-06-15 15:16:36,False,True

Once again like Ghostbusters 2016 we have a male and female feminist who both worked together on a screenplay that promotes feminism and lesbianism.  Paul Feig and Katie Dippold both wrote the misandric screenplay that promotes feminism, racism, LGBTQ, and divisiveness.  Did anyone notice the scripted MeToo bait articles typed by the controlled media? If you have a keen eye you will notice what the articles are really saying. The articles are saying...  (We the elite realise people are too stupid to notice we are trolling people with this blatant divisive gender politics propaganda film called Ocean's 8. We had no intention of ever having Matt Damon in our feminist propaganda film and these scripted articles were typed to get people to blame the MeToo movement for Matt Damon's cameo being cut. Those of you who are stupid enough to blame the MeToo movement for Matt Damon's cameo being cut will only help us promote misogyny arguments. We enjoy the fact that Ocean's 8 is promoting feminism, lesbianism, and divisiveness just like Ghostbusters 2016. Of course you fools didn't realise Ghostbusters 2016 was just a test to see how people would react to the film.

Ocean's 8 is made for delusional feminists that march around with vagina hats on screaming about a make-believe patriarchy and being oppressed prisoners in their homes. Feminism is a lie and if you don't believe that talk to all the former female feminists who abandoned feminism after feminism ruined their lives. The Suffragettes were delusional terrorists trained in ju-jitsu who planted explosives, burned buildings, vandalized things, and  attempted to assainate the Prime Minister. The Suffragettes whined about the right to vote when many UK men didn‚Äôt have the right to vote. The Suffragettes called for the conscription of UK men many of which were forced to serve in World War I dying on the battlefield with no voting rights. The Suffragettes walked the streets shaming any males they spotted with white feathers even though those males were ineligible for military duty or were home on military leave. Feminism is and always has been a social engineering tool designed to destroy humanity. Stop spreading the nonsense about the first wave feminists being the ""good"" feminists and the third wave (feminazis) being the bad feminists.

Of course you feminists created this film to troll, and now you're blaming the negative reviews on white men and misogynists.

Whining about misogyny every time people will not conform to or support your misandric feminist women's supremacy agendas only makes feminism look more ridiculous.

Ocean's 8 was written by two feminists to promote misandry and lesbianism. These social justice films are social engineering propaganda financed by the elite.

My problem with this film isn't the women it is how the women were used and why. Ocean's 8 uses women to promote false feminist equality, and the film promotes social engineering and divisiveness. Ocean's 8 says women are too stupid, lazy, and weak to make their own successful film franchises. Women should feel insulted that Warner Bros. believes this feminist nonsense riding the coattails of a successful masculine film franchise is empowering women.  Any fool can quote the textbook definition of feminism, but intelligent people know feminism in action has always been a lie. Feminism is a women's supremacy movement and hate movement masquerading as an equality movement. Everything that is masculine must be feminized, and feminists will never be satisfied. There can never be gender equality because males and females are not the same.

Ocean's 8 has earned $254,885,183 globally at the time of this writing, but we need to subtract some important numbers from that global gross total.  The average split with distributors is 49% with the lowest reported split being 43% which changes every week as the film continues to be shown. The longer the film stays in cinemas the more money the distributors keep. Also keep in mind the cost of marketing and distribution of the film which costs millions. Finally the original cost to film Ocean's 8 is reported to be $70 million. Black Panther has earned $1,346,567,144 globally.  Avengers: Infinity War has earned $2,042,294,443. Ocean's 8 has a long way to go to be considered impressive at the box office. Remember that Warner Bros. owns 30% of Rotten Tomatoes so the positive reviews can't be trusted.

Hela crushed Thor's hammer like a fortune cookie, and Hela is also revealed to be the one that helped Odin build his empire.  Chris Hemsworth had no problem with being wheeled around restrained to a chair like a weak beta male. And Chris Hemsworth also enjoyed walking around with a shock collar device on his neck which shocked Chris like a dog every time he spoke his mind. No surprise from Chris considering he signed on to be a glorified weak feminist Ken doll in Ghostbusters 2016. It's revealed that Hela helped Odin build his empire, and Hela apparently kills the entire Asgardian army by herself.

2018-09-13T21:36:49,Feminist Ocean's 8 screenplay writers Olivia Milch and Gary Ross proved feminism is about women's supremacy and misandry. Blame and shame blokes while hijacking a successful masculine film franchise to troll and promote feminist ideology. Instead of making a true spin-off feminists hijacked the Ocean's film franchise and the feminists falsely claim Ocean's 8 is empowering women. And of course the bad reviews were blamed on misogyny and angry white males.  Ocean's 8 was created to promote the lie that is feminism and to promote divisiveness.  Where have we seen this tactic before? Ghostbusters 2016 was written by male and female feminists Paul Feig and Katie Dippold.  The Ghostbusters film featured misandric propaganda and the backlash to the film was blamed on misogyny and angry male nerds.

The fact that Warner Bros. calls this film a spin-off is misleading because Ocean's 8 is clearly a rehashed feminist version of both Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's 11. The elite wanted to get the feminist propaganda to cinemas so that the controlled media could release their nonsense about gender equality in Hollywood.  But of course the bad reviews were blamed on misogyny and angry white males scared of women. Then you go on the Internet and there are perpetual false arguments about feminism and how anti-feminists are misogynists trying to oppress women. You elite and your puppet feminists don't fool me.

This Outstanding Cast Rocked this whole Movie :)  I haven't really watched the other series but I liked this one a LOT. Sandra Bullock as always does a smart-stylish-funny fabulous job, and Cate B. is her usual hip on- top-of-it-all character. Mindy Kaling-Super Fabulous, as per usual. Love her line, ""of course you would have to see it in the light,"" Ha! I have actually said and done that. It really is true. The Jeweler saying, ""this is the light""- is a very tacky non-expert reply. It was odd. Rihanna is SO Cool -she was probably like..., ""Yeah, I suppose I could make an appearance at the Met""... Rihanna IS the Met.  Loved the Anna Wintour Cameo :) Like the line, which is kind of blase and minimal, ""Which Leo? There is only ONE Leo!""-that was very cute :)  Anne Hathaway-Brilliant üí´ Cartier is a perfect choice to house the jewels. I actually have been in Cartier when I was very young. The necklaces really are knock you out gorgeous...but at the end of the day, I can only buy some fake glass (Victoria Wieck is a very Classic and Environmentally Conscious Designer), and it's what I can afford; if it's lab created, no-one died in the trenches picking it out.

As she pours her beverage into a martini glass, pay close attention to the tombstone to her lowest bottom right.    Engraved into the granite facing appear the words 'Helga M. Meyer' 1992 ‚Äì 2010 as the date of birth and death of the deceased. Sandra's biological mother sadly passed on April 4, 2000--her name was as it appears on the tombstone in the movie -- Helga M. Meyer.    The last words of dialog spoken as Sandy gazes directly into the camera in this final scene right before it fades to black and the end credits begin roll are-- ""you would've loved it.""    This is no coincidence. The final scene is cleverly crafted as a sentimental homage to her deceased mother who didn't get to see her daughter's best work, and who was by death denied the opportunity to witness her beloved daughter receive an Academy Award.    Although Helga may not be with you in the physical form Sandra, she will always be with you in spirit and is aware of what a remarkable woman you've become artistically-- including the adoptions of two beautiful children in desperate need of someone in this cruel world to want them, to need them, to love them.
