2017-08-08T17:10:19,"I think this movie will represent a high way to hell as Jennifer Lawrence (mentioned before) sooner becomes the sacrifice, of what I understand in the trailer her conditionally loved husband becomes possessed  with love so much that souls or humans start coming into his house and starts to control it, in the house itself there is an elevator to hell, which Jennifer doesn't know about but finds out(sees, she has a chance to escape), her husband is so easily convinced that the first man that visited the place probably thought 'this is the one chance to start what I never finished', and Jennifer knows this is somehow strange and soon lives the nightmare itself. I think this is a type of movie that Jennifer will survive but she will never be freed from the nightmare itself. She will always be followed. She in the movie knows that they aren't normal people especially the strangers wife she is the evil that tries to drive Jennifer crazy to her will for her to become insane. This might also explain the blood on the carpet it could mean 'this house has been marked' or it could mean ' it's time for the story to come back after so many years. Jennifer sees more that her husband, she sees what will happen, she sees what her husband can't see. Her husband is insane he just wants love which potentially drove him crazy. Also the title of the movie 'MOTHER' could potentially mean she is the mother that will be salvished and sacrificed, or the weird lady is the mother that controls everyone(well is made to, she might be also posed by the crazy old dude that first comes to the house)  This movie can have so many turns.

So guys, please do this comment on top‚ÄúMost people, after they see the film, they don‚Äôt even wanna look at me,‚Äù says Darren Aronofsky with a basso profundo chuckleDuring those rehearsals, he was particularly focused on Lawrence, who provides Mother!‚Äôs incendiary core. ‚ÄúI think there were a lot of things that the script asked that I have never seen her do, so I was trying to figure out how we were going to get there,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd during the rehearsals, she was very, very relaxed. She was present, but never really pushed herself. It wasn‚Äôt appropriate for me to push that, even though I wasn‚Äôt sure how she was going to do it. And I really didn‚Äôt get to know the character until we started shooting, and she showed up.‚Äù Perhaps too much so, at times. ‚ÄúI think she hyperventilated and also kind of threw a rib out,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúDuring the big climax of the movie, I mean, she started ‚Ä¶‚Äù He trails off, then gets an emphatic look on his face. ‚ÄúShe really went there. The producers were freaking out. We had to sort of calm it down and then go for it again. And the thing is, there‚Äôs so much ability there that somehow she can summon it again and again.‚Äù And she has to: The film is almost entirely composed of her or her immediate surroundings. ‚ÄúThe film is basically either over her shoulder, on her face, or her POV,‚Äù Aronofsky says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only shots. There are a few wide shots when she‚Äôs alone. But beyond that, the camera is basically in three places.‚Äù The result is an unsettlingly intimate finished product that puts the viewer inside her skin for two increasingly white-knuckled hours.     JEN WAS SAYING::::: ‚ÄúI had to go to a darker place than I‚Äôve ever been in my life,‚Äù the actress told Vogue. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be able to come out ok.‚Äù During one scene, Lawrence came out with a dislocated rib after she was hyperventilating too intensely, which more or less sounds like standard procedure on an Aronofsky movie. Production had to stop for a short while so the actress could be put on oxygen. ‚ÄúI have oxygen tubes in my nostrils, and Darren‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòIt was out of focus; we‚Äôve got to do it again,'‚Äù Lawrence said. ‚ÄúAnd I was just like, ‚ÄòGo fuck yourself.'‚Äù In order to help Lawrence cope with the incredibly tense material, the crew set up a ‚Äúhappy place‚Äù so that she could escape the set when needed and distance herself from the ordeals of her character. Lawrence‚Äôs ‚Äúhappy place‚Äù consisted of gumballs and a television playing clips on loop of the Kardashians. It may sound ridiculous, but it was needed to make sure Lawrence was always focused for the next take.     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a raw, natural talent she has,‚Äù Aronofsky said about his leading lady (who also just happens to be his girlfriend of over a year now). ‚ÄúI always kind of compare her to Michael Jordan.‚Äù     ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a very brave actress with no boundaries and doesn‚Äôt need to be hurt in order to create pain,‚Äù added Bardem about his co-star. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs truly committed to go as far as needed.‚Äù     Apparently Lawrence was afraid to go as far as dislocating her rib for the role. The last time a female lead in an Aronofsky movie lost her mind, it was Natalie Portman in ‚ÄúBlack Swan.‚Äù Could ‚Äúmother!‚Äù bring Lawrence back to the Dolby Theater next year?

Religion indulges humanity to do what it wants without thinking of the consequences as it refuses to respect nature.  It makes one think & that's always the sign of good work. Of course, the Religious Right in America will burn inside with rage as they believe it to be an attack against their beliefs/values. For me, I think it's a cool religious & political critique of the current era.

It will save you 2 hours and whatever the cost is in your area for a movie ticket, popcorn and a drink  1. Our titular mother, Jennifer Lawrence, both begins, and ends, the movie on fire .  2. Thinking back, I‚Äôm honestly not sure if it‚Äôs the same mother on fire both times but‚Ä¶you know, that‚Äôs not the point.  3. Mother keeps drinking this weird, yellow liquid that looks like sunshine and every time she does the sharpest, shrillest sound comes out of the movie like nails on a chalkboard.  4. Him (you know, mother‚Äôs husband, played by Javier Bardem) invites a *Stranger* into the house to spend the night after he gets lost. The only reason this strange man is lost is because he thought him and mother‚Äôs house was a bed and breakfast? Like yeah, sure, Stranger.  5. Mother is repainting a room, but doing a really shitty job at it and just like, mixes plaster with herbs and just like‚Ä¶splatters it onto the wall and shares at it? And no offense, mother, but they‚Äôre both really bad colors for a room.  6. The Strange Man‚Äôs wife arrives, the Strange Lady, and she immediately makes boozy lemonade.  7. Mother hates the Strange Lady‚Äôs lime green lacy underwear, so she throws it behind the washing machine, and this is the only time I laughed during the movie.  8. Someone is beaten to death with a doorknob.  9. The funeral party that is suddenly taking place at the house (you know, over the doorknob incident) feel bad about intruding and start painting the interior of the house. Wow, I wish you guys would come to my place and paint for me.  10. There is a blood stain on the wood floor that is maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe supposed to resemble a vagina, but seriously, don‚Äôt ask me to explain that any further.  11. At one point, mother flushes a still-beating heart down the toilet.  12. After having sex once (I can only assume they‚Äôve only had sex once), mother gets pregnant.  13. Even odder, mother immediately knows she‚Äôs pregnant. Kinda like how you just KNOW when you‚Äôre period has arrived.  14. Him writes the best poem (Short story? Novella? Tweet? Never fully explained) ever, and it sends literally e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g into a spiral, and it‚Äôs not a good spiral. It‚Äôs a spiral of destruction.  15. Because mother and Him never properly installed locks on any of their doors, people just start showing up at their house, unannounced and uninvited.  16. These new visitors to the house build an entire shrine for Him, and that‚Äôs not weird or anything.  17. Mother is a little too over protective of her sink countertop, and keeps yelling at everyone because they are sitting on it. It eventually breaks, and this sends mother into a spiraling rage.  18. There‚Äôs a sudden and sharp turn in the movie, where it shifts to ‚Äî and seriously, the only way I can describe it is this ‚Äî Showpiercer. You know that movie with Chris Evans on the snow apocalypse train? That‚Äôs what it becomes for like the last for 45 minutes. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶chaos and too many people yelling at other people.  19. Kristen Wiig takes a bunch of people hostage, and shoots them.  20. The movie turns into a‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶war movie?  21. Okay let me try and explain this: Roughly 40 years of history takes place in the span of maybe 10 mins as mother (also, mother is pregnant during all of this, BTW) and him try to make it to higher grounds in their house, which is being torn apart by war. An actual war. There are bunkers and barricades set up and the SWAT team shows up at one point.  22. If you‚Äôre still here with me,  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø .  23. Mother gives birth, unaided by a doctor and drugs, maybe the most unrealistic thing in the entire movie.  24. Him barricades himself and mother in his study, where they only have to eat fruit, and this may or may not be a Garden of Eden reference?  25. Mother refuses to let Him hold the baby, so she stays awake for what I think was like, four days maybe.  26. Unfortunately, she eventually falls asleep and Him straight up kidnaps the baby.  27. Mother and Him‚Äôs baby is given to the crowds in their house, and the baby crowdsurfs, and it ends so tragically I honestly do not even want to write about it here.  28. ‚Ä¶and then the people in the house eat the baby, and it is just straight up cannibalistic.  29. Mother who has HAD ENOUGH OF THIS SHIT makes her way to the basement and sets the house (and herself) on fire.  30. The beating heart thing throughout the movie turns out to BE a heart, and (I think) it‚Äôs mother‚Äôs heart, and it‚Äôs the glass crystal from the beginning of the movie that Him uses to ‚Äúbreathe life‚Äù back into everything, and it‚Äôs also what the man and woman smash, and honestly does any of this even make the least bit sense.  31. The movie restarts the same way it opened, with him ‚Äúbreathing life‚Äù back into everything. In short, the movie is basically Groundhogs Day.  And now you can say you‚Äôve seen Mother!.",89,19,Amanda Reece,XpICoc65uh0,0.017064299713553444,2017-09-19 18:01:53,False,True

Like, I know that the creators of the film were going for an allegorical and suspenseful sort of psychological thriller, but really, all it is is a boring, confusing, try-hard movie that is as annoying as it is ‚Äúpoetic‚Äù.  The main issue here is the desperate attempt at retelling the book of Genesis in the Holy Bible. NOBODY would freaking figure it out until they‚Äôve finished watching the film, gone online, and Googled ‚Äúmother! plot explanation‚Äù. Seriously, though. Everything in the movie, all the symbolism and allegory, has been highly confusing and misleading. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs supposed to be this amazing, artistic, masterpiece-like film; IT‚ÄôS GARBAGE.  One thing I‚Äôve learned about film and writing: If your audience have to Google an explanation of the movie after they‚Äôve watched it, you failed at storytelling. It‚Äôs the same thing with people who are obsessed with unnecessarily using almost-unheard-of words in the hopes of sounding like they are so smart and have the widest vocabulary. It‚Äôs just stupid. It only means that you suck so bad that you have to rely on ‚Äúsmart-sounding‚Äù words because the message you are trying to tell is irrelevant and basic.   Simple is the new smart.

Spoilers ahead:  This was my take on the movie. The whole movie is an analogy of the bible and humanities perspective of God. The house represents paradise/the garden of Eden, with the husband representing god. The husband invites a man and a women into their home who represent Adam and Eve. The prized jewel represents the forbidden fruit. When the couple mess up and break the jewel this reflects Adam and Eve eating the fruit followed by the husband/God ordering them to leave. The couples sons who represent Cain and Abel arrive and kill each other. The blood stain on the floor that won't clean represents sin/mark of Cain. The other guests represent humanity and mankind. When they come into their homemade house/world/perfect creation they cause chaos, anarchy and destruction. Jennifer Lawrence questions why her husband won't get rid of their guests/humanity because of how destructive they are but he won't. This represents God's love for humanity and the hope that he can restore relationship between them. The baby obviously represents Jesus which initially causes peace followed by his murder by the husbands fans/so called followers. With Jenifer Lawrence dying breath she gives her husband/God her love which mends this broken relationship with the fall of man/mental fans. The writers block represents the years of silence of God between the old and new testament. At the end of the movie we see a new actress wake in the bed representing a new heaven and earth with followers of God receiving a new body. If you don't know the bible this would've been hard to follow. I thought it was awesome though.",1,0,Bern OS,XpICoc65uh0,0.11227272727272726,2017-09-25 04:33:39,False,True

Disturbing film, all the social chaos and controversial things you can imagine tossed into the life of a Lawrence as she and the house she repaired are trashed and invaded at the invitation of her seemingly immortal (maybe) husband. Really weird film, there are two separated ways to see the film, one can see it from the point of view of the disturbed wife, or from the general social impact on their lives. Plus in the last half hour a surreal imploding of their lives into anarchy seems almost made believed. The scenes of her baby and what happens later are a little tough to watch, religious like baby sacrifice and cannibalism are a bit too much for me. There is a biblical element along the film, that is hard to miss for sure. the beginning of the film is the end, a classic technique that seems well over used, In this one I think it should not have been used for surprising the audience with the sacrifice of the female  to renew the house revealed at the end.

2017-12-07T00:07:25,"***SPOILERS ALERT *** *** This review may contain spoilers ***  First of all, please don't watch this film if you have trouble understanding metaphors & symbolism.  It's pretty clear that there are quite a number of reviews/rants on this page with people expressing their hate towards the story and how it's been portrayed on screen. It's strange because it looks like they had absolutely no idea what they were watching... it's trivial and shallow to publish a review without any research. However, I do agree that it isn't an easy one to sit through, but some of the greatest films aren't. So again, please don't bother checking it out if your mind is closed, you won't appreciate this masterpiece.  To help deter unaccommodating opinions being regurgitated, I'll try to explain what made the film worth your time.  I believe there are two themes that can be interpreted from Mother!! Therefore, the use of an additional explanation mark is required.  Religious Theory;  Pretty sure the inconvenient truth to this theory is that when the sh*t hits the fan, mother doesn't like people messing up her house (Earth). Apparently, Darren Aronofsky is not religious but he likes strong environmental messages. He also wrote the script in 5 days.. how long did it take God to create the world? Just saying.  Jennifer Lawrence is (Mother) Earth ‚Äî The house is Earth.  Javier Bardem (Him) is God ‚Äî Creator of life on Earth, loves attention, and forgives everyone.  Ed Harris (Man) is Adam ‚Äî Invited by God to Earth (aka house)  Michelle Pfeiffer (Woman) is Eve ‚Äî Created from Adam's rib (scene where Ed Harris was sick on the toilet)  The crystal is the forbidden fruit (apple)  The baby is the bread at the last supper ""Body of Christ""  Relationship Theory;  An extreme version of anxiety in a relationship that is deteriorating. The tense build-up in social interactions and how someone may view a scenario where they feel left out and forgotten. The jealousy someone feels when their bond is shared. Not paying attention to the needs of one another in a relationship. Having a baby to keep the relationship alive. All these emotions are magnified/multiplied by 100 to the point it's literally terrifying, so crazy that it may make you laugh. Finally, once the love has completely diminished, the only thing left is to leave and start again new.  Either way, this film is unique and original in the way it's portrayed, packaged and presented.   Hope you can appreciate the beauty of this Gothic religious tale / art-house opera and award the actors & production team that helped make it possible.

Mother Earth worked hard to create earth. Jen/mother worked hard to build the house. The house is earth. Human overpopulation, humans not caring about the earth and remember the part when the couple were painting the house? It's how humans are making the earth how they want it but not how it's supposed to be. Like building buildings and factories. The house is destroyed. How humans are destroying the earth. That's also why the husband didn't die. Because he's god. Reincarnation is how the other woman was there at the end. And remember how in the beginning, the older woman (not mother) said ""why don't you buy a new house instead of building this one after it was burnt down?"" (Something like that) is because the previous mother burnt down the house like Jen/mother. If there's anything I missed, please reply on this. *MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE* oh yea and: mind=blown Edit: and she had the baby to try to revive the world and give it new life but the people killed it.

Poco a poco el comportamiento de su marido va siendo m√°s extra√±o, y ella empieza a estresarse y a intentar echar a todo el mundo. Solo cinco d√≠as tard√≥ Aronofksy en escribir el gui√≥n frente a los diez a√±os que le llev√≥ poner en marcha El cisne negro y ah√≠ es donde reside que la pel√≠cula sea un fiasco Durante su estreno en el Festival de Venecia recibi√≥ abucheos , algo impensable en este evento, usualmente esto ocurre en Cannes, sencillamente el p√∫blico ped√≠a que la retiraran de exhibici√≥n M√°s all√° de lo controversial o irreverente que pueda llegar a ser Aronofsky, recuerdo que Noe tampoco fue un t√≠tulo recomendable , Mother! la supera en todos los sentidos La pel√≠cula se viste de thriller psicol√≥gico con trasfondo de cr√≠tica social y termina siendo de principio a fin totalmente irracional e incoherente. Sabemos que el director es dado a plasmar filosof√≠as pero Mother! no tiene nada que ver con La fuente de la vida , otro t√≠tulo que tambi√©n te dejaba algo desencajado pero aun as√≠ se admiraba. Cada escena , cada di√°logo es tan absurdo, precisamente porque la trama es il√≥gica , eso s√≠ algunos planos y la fotograf√≠a son asombrosos El reparto no ayuda en ning√∫n sentido , Jennifer Lawrence, es la protagonista absoluta y aunque la considere una actriz sobrevalorada pensaba que tal vez en esta ocasi√≥n har√≠a algo decoroso, me equivoqu√©, lo peor de su carrera. Javier Bardem, en algunos momentos impresiona y es cre√≠ble pero tampoco ejecuta su personaje con grandes br√≠os Ed Harris y Michelle Pfeiffer supongo que est√°n de relleno, es lamentable verlos a todos juntos en escena.

This is exactly the sort of risky, ""out there"" cinema I've been missing for far too long. So of course it flopped and people hate it! I suppose it doesn't lend itself very well to memes and hashtags...  I didn't find it to be horrific, though, which perhaps was Aronofsky's intention. It's classified as a psychological horror film. Instead, I thought that it was SO over the top that eventually the absurdity of it all turned darkly comedic. Which is fortunate, because I'd rather watch something outrageous than some kind of symbolic take on motherhood and its inherent protective and nurturing qualities against nature and the world. Or love.  I have a sneaking suspicion that the film was intended as just such a symbolic device for Aronofsky's philosophical ideas, but nevertheless, that's not what I got from the film. I got what I wanted to get from it, and it was very entertaining.  It's like a romantic tragedy as envisioned by Terry Gilliam.

Majority of viewers want to have straight plot with bunch of shocking scenes, interesting plot not allegories and metaphors about which they should think afterwards. I understand it but for me it's a sad fact. It is called ART. Okey I expect comments like yes it's shitty art then. But at least for me this movie (art) was like a moving picture movie, where all scenes were dived into the blocks. It was like a picture  from the famous painter which you can ADMIRE or HATE it. I admire it how it was done and hate what it expresses. And that's why I love this movie overall. It's not that ""funky-bloddy"" horror movie, I wouldn't categorize this movie either. It was something innovative just like Cloud Atlas. I can start talking about its all details (impossible) but at least I want to hightlight two things.   SPOILERS. The destruction of the house also expressed how the things in our real world are, how we treat our mother of nature. Overpopulation, people were coming and coming, hunger, problems of different cultures, religions or just people who have different opinions, then suddenly the military came and wanted to make a peace or what which makes even more chaos, some people were painted the house, they wanted to fix the house (nature) or protected her literally (the soldier) but it was too late. Secondly I find her husband not only as symbol of god but also as life itself which demands to survive even in ashes and needs mother of nature for it. Her heart is pure good and wisdom to how all things must be kept  in balance and harmony. All in all selfishness of life and people  bring  the world to the ultimate end.

It's pretty obvious what it's about really.

My philosophical self realized there are some biblical themes without even reading about it, but I would say it was more like satanistic way to depict religion. ""God"" was represented by a maniacal selfish sociopath who was abusing his wife all the time and didnt give a sh*t about her feelings, needs or didnt even have basic decency to ask his wife if she is ok with inviting large group of people to their house. And when the crowd massacred the baby, I was so disgusted and shaken, I wanted to throw up. The picture of gutted newborn was such a psycho, I dont believe any sane human cand create it. I regret the time I spent on this movie, it was like poison for normality. I dont understand how such a sickening madness can be praised, just because it pretends to be art.

Now, I will say that  I knew from the get go that Darren Aronofsky set out to make a planet earth and Mother Nature message intertwined with religious (possibly sac religious depending on who you talk to) metaphors.  But as someone who watched this in a Kubrick like fashion, where the answer is not as important as the interpretation that speaks to you, it gave me a new perspective on the film that I really appreciate and perhaps will not forget for a long time.  And I think if a movie achieves this, then in my mind the film and it‚Äôs artist have succeeded , even if that means no standing ovations from general audiences...film has always been used to break barriers in how we approach life, and I think that philosophy is dying in a world populated with much Hollywood cash-grabs which is why I feel this fascination, entertainment value, and appreciation for mother!",0,1,Rooseter7080,XpICoc65uh0,0.07106643356643357,2018-04-30 22:10:06,False,False

2018-05-11T20:22:55,"I really dislike trailers that hide or misdirect the actual tone of the movie. Here, I was anticipating a creepy thriller/horror, under the impression that Lawrence's character was a unstable introverted woman who did not want anyone in her family's house (or something to that effect). Other than re watching the trailer and noticing one or two vague instances of possible hints, I wasn't expecting a movie that was 100% allegorical to the stories of the Christian religion, and I feel like the amount of religious themes that the trailer chose to omit seemed like a intentional misdirection to get more than just the religious folk in there. Not everyone might agree with that, but that is what I took away after watching the movie and considering the themes. It felt like a cheap tactic to get a bigger audience turnout and I can't really respect that. At least if it was more upfront in the trailer I'd have known this wouldn't have been the movie for me (and if that was supposed to be the big twist or something, it was not well done in that regard)  Besides this, I understood the symbolism and allegories just fine, but the tone of the movie just felt... Bitter, I guess? There was a lot of gross and abhorrent imagery and scenes that made it surpass being disturbing in a way to have the audience reflect on a message, and instead seemed to exist to purposefully make people disgusted. It seemed like it was trying to shock just to shock, as rather than consider a deeper meaning, i just felt upset and uncomfortable having watched it (and that's coming from someone who doesn't get disturbed by much). I also found the sound design to be sub par, as it seemed kind of odd and jarring at times, but that's a small nitpick.   The acting was indeed well executed, and the beginning of the film did have me initially intrigued, but other than that it didn't have much to offer, to me at least. I suppose the real problems imo are the over-the-top gross visual imagery near the end and the chrisitan symbolism that drives 100% of the movie's logic and story, which i understand isn't a problem for everyone, but as it is not something i find that interesting or i believe in, i just simply could not enjoy it.",0,0,Nytro GamingGod,XpICoc65uh0,-0.03292682926829268,2018-05-11 20:22:55,False,False

Watching the movie for the first time maybe hard to pick up these messages to be honest and I understand if people don't get the plot of the story, ‚Äòcause the story never had a clear storyline, it was more of a metaphorical storyline.",0,1,snow,XpICoc65uh0,0.14652777777777778,2018-07-07 04:13:29,False,False

She was just there to serve him and when she gave birth he took the child and gave it to his adoring followers to sacrifice and she had no power or say in the matter,  she was his slave and her only out was to kill herself.  He lost his child servant bride and her love and devotion and so he took everything he could like a narcissist and even ripped out her heart before she was dead just so he could still have her love....A very evil and self absorbed man taking and taking and taking and his adoring fans was all that mattered to him.  He loved the attention and admiration more than anything.  Ok that was the best I could do after spending an hour trying to figure out what I just watched.

He gives them a child, being Jesus our savior, and we take and sin. The mother touches the home, the home representing earth, and sees that it is dying, just like earth due to humans destroying its beauty. The cover art represents this. The beginning you see the new guest puking in the toilet with his rib side cut open. He then gets a new wife from out of nowhere. They go against the husband and wifes rules, representing Adam and Eve going against God, and take the crystal and break it, like the apple from the snake. They also have sex, original sin.

2019-08-15T13:35:06,"Darren Aronofsky‚Äôs¬†mother!¬†is bound to be one of the most divisive films of the year. Eschewing traditional narratives and character is just the tip of the iceberg for the aesthetically aggressive movie that isn‚Äôt quite the psychological horror it‚Äôs billed as and certainly not in the vein of¬†Rosemary‚Äôs¬†Babybeyond featuring a stressed out pregnant woman. But because¬†mother!¬†operates along the lines of dream logic and because the film is so steeped in symbolism and tone rather than character and plot, it can be a bit confusing to say the least. The film invites conversation, and the best thing I can say about¬†mother!¬†is that it‚Äôs the kind of film that will have you talking with your friends afterwards.  But if you‚Äôre still a little confused or just want another take to engage with, here‚Äôs mine [seriously,¬†we‚Äôre going total spoilers ahead, so stop reading now if you haven‚Äôt seen the movie].  ÔøºÔøº  Image via Paramount  mother!¬†is an allegory about God and the Earth.¬†Javier Bardem‚Äôs character, whom I‚Äôll refer to as The Poet, is God, and¬†Jennifer Lawrence‚Äôs character, whom I‚Äôll refer to as The Mother, is Mother Earth with the house standing in for the environment. From there, the story attempts to be a biblical allegory of both the Old and New Testament as well as a brief, deeply misanthropic view of human history.  Ed Harris‚Äô man represents Adam. When he‚Äôs puking in the bathroom, we quickly see an injury right where his rib would be. In the next scene, his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer), representing Eve shows up. They‚Äôre allowed to wander the house, but are told specifically not to go the poet‚Äôs office, but they do so anyway where Eve accidentally breaks the fire crystal. They‚Äôre then exiled and soon begin having sex elsewhere in the house, thus representing original sin and man‚Äôs fall from grace after eating the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge in the Garden of Eden.  ÔøºÔøº  Image via Paramount  Then the couple‚Äôs sons (Brian¬†and Domhnall Gleeson) come along arguing about their dying father‚Äôs will. In their argument, one brother kills the other (Cain and Abel). The parents and the poet carry the dead brother out of the house and the surviving brother runs away. The poet and the parents then return later that night for a wake, and more and more guests come to grieve, but the wake then becomes a chaotic party where, after numerous protestations to not sit on an un-braced sink, the sink becomes unmoored from the wall and water pours into the house. Thus we have humanity‚Äôs downfall following the slaying of Abel and eventually the flood.  ÔøºÔøº  Image via Paramount  After the water pours into the house and the guests leave, the mother admonishes the poet, saying that he won‚Äôt even have sex with her. They then proceed to have sex, and the following morning, she announces she‚Äôs pregnant. He‚Äôs then struck with a flash of inspiration and goes downstairs naked to write. When he shows her the finished product, she sees a vision of the world rejuvenated and says that it‚Äôs beautiful. However, once again people start flooding into their home and although she‚Äôs prepared a nice, quiet meal for her and the poet, the fully pregnant mother is overwhelmed by a throng of people.  At this point, the story is kind of leaving the biblical text behind and moving more into historical record. The New Testament element is that the Mother‚Äôs child is a Christ figure, but before he‚Äôs born, the Mother goes through a hellish experience surrounded by war, human trafficking, and other nightmarish visuals before the Poet finally reappears and brings her to his private office where she can give birth to their son. The allegory here seems to be that God abandoned the Earth for stretches at a time before the messiah figure was born.  Ôøº  Image via Paramount  But then mankind screws it all up again and snatches away the baby, kills it, and eats its flesh as they worship at an altar to the Poet. They then assault the Mother, ripping at her clothes and beating her senseless before she‚Äôs finally able to escape, go down to the basement, smash open an oil drum, and set the entire place on fire. So even when presented with a savior and total innocent, mankind only kills, eats the flesh of the Messiah (i.e. communion), then proceeds to assault Mother Earth with God absent yet again, and Mother Earth finally uses oil (i.e. fossil fuels) to destroy herself along with humanity with God powerless to stop it.  Ôøº  Image via Paramount  The Poet then takes the mother‚Äôs charred body and takes out her beating heart with his hands. She turns to ash and the burned heart becomes a new fire crystal. He places the new fire crystal in its holder and we‚Äôre brought back to the beginning of the film where placing the fire crystal in the holder undoes the fire damage and a woman wakes up in their bed. The only thing that‚Äôs different this time is a different young woman wakes up in the bed. So basically the Earth and humanity will die and at best God will simply do everything all over again because he needs to create and desires love from his creations.  Additionally, throughout the film, the Mother will pause when getting overwhelmed, and touch the walls of the house where she‚Äôll have a vision of a heart that‚Äôs slowing dying. Furthermore, the house continues to bleed, crack, and fall apart. This reinforcing the notion that Mother Nature is seeing that the environment is dying, especially as more people enter the house and cause chaos.  Ôøº  Image via Paramount  None of this is surprising when you consider that Aronofsky is an atheist, he‚Äôs staunchly environmental, and that humanity‚Äôs downfall in the face of an environmental catastrophe and an absent God was the theme of the director‚Äôs previous film,¬†Noah.  To be fair, not everything in the film is a one-to-one ratio, and not everything, especially in the second half, lines up with the biblical text or the entire course of human history. Does Ed Harris‚Äô character being a doctor mean anything? Perhaps, but I‚Äôm not sure what. Why does all the war and chaos precede the birth of the messiah figure rather than follow it? Isn‚Äôt there war and chaos on both sides of the New Testament? Additionally, the God represented here isn‚Äôt the only view of a supreme being, but for Aronofsky, it‚Äôs how he views God‚Äîas a figure who is frequently absent when needed yet constantly feels the need both to create and to be loved despite the terrible behavior of mankind and the abuse they shower upon Mother Earth.  Ôøº  Image via Paramount  There are also loose ends that I can‚Äôt tie up or figure out if they even represent anything. I‚Äôm not sure what the yellow liquid the Mother keeps drinking represents. I don‚Äôt know why 911 answers the phone when the Mother calls (who does Mother Earth call in the event of an emergency?). But despite these lingering questions, I‚Äôm fairly confident in my reading that the movie is about the relationship between God, Mother Earth, the environment, and humanity with Aronofsky coming down on the side of humanity being a plague upon the Earth.  Ôøº  Image via Paramount  I‚Äôve also heard a few other readings of the film, but I don‚Äôt think they account for the entire picture. One reading sees¬†mother!¬†as a story about creation, looking at the Poet as a stand in for all artists and the double-edged sword about the need to create and the destruction that a work can wreak when it‚Äôs released to the public. While I think Aronofsky certainly feels some kinship to his God figure in terms of an artist needing to create, this reading fails to account for the copious amounts of biblical symbolism, and, more importantly, fails to account for the Mother.  Ôøº  Image via Paramount  Another reading of the film sees this as a semi-autobiographical take for both Aronofsky and Lawrence. First, Pfeiffer‚Äôs character makes the comment that the Poet is a little old for the Mother. Aronofsky is 48, and Lawrence is 27. There‚Äôs also the aforementioned kinship between Aronofsky and the God figure, and the frustration of being worshipped by fans but also the fear they create with their constant devotion. Then, when the Mother is attacked and her clothes are being ripped from her body, you can point to how when Lawrence‚Äôs nude photos of were hacked from her phone and leaked online, she later told¬†Vanity Fair¬†that the hack was a ‚Äúsex crime.‚Äù But again, this reading fails to account for the entirety of the movie and the overarching allegory.  That‚Äôs not to say my reading of¬†mother!¬†is the only valid assessment of the film or that art can only have one interpretation. However, I do believe that my case has the most evidence to support it, and if you disagree, I have one more thing to add:  Look at the title.

And I will try to explain why* (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!): *(This is what I got from the movie. I am sure other people felt differently, which is normal)   This movie is a tale. Not for children but for grown-ups. It is the adult version of, for instance, ""hansel & gretel"", etc. And not only because of the plot itself but also for the way Aronofsky presents it (the beginning is the end, cyclic-wise). Therefore nothing that happens in the movie is strictly real but it is a metaphor of the human condition. This movie is A TALE of the human condition.  Jealousy, Narcissism, unconditional love, lust, avarice, pride. All the most beautiful/dangerous human feelings are taken to unrealistic extremes, but the movie shows you how amazing/cruel our life sometimes is, because we FEEL these emotions in our daily life. He (Javier Bardem) is a narcissistic motherfucker that would do ANYTHING for his ego and to feel loved by others. He is a sink of energy. Dont tell me you have not found people like this in your life. Whereas she (Jennifer Lawrence) unconditionally loves him. Even after he got the baby killed because of his EGO, she is still willing to give him her heart. ""is this enough for you?"" she asks, and IT IS NOT! It will never be enough. The couple (M.Pfeifer and Ed Harris) and their children are the highest exponents of selfishness. They bring their shit to the house and Mother (Jen. Lawrence) feels it and is really disgusted by this. And M. Pfeifer is JEALOUS of her, because deep inside knows that Mother is a good, loving and charming person. That is why M. Pfeifer is proud and happy of fucking up her life, and you feel it with the way they look at each other and the faces they put. And the final mess, caused uniquely by HIS EGO (JAVIER BARDEM), where the house is practically a Civil War settlement, is used only to show how even in the most adverse circumstances Mother still has energy to create and to try to find a solution for her family.",7,1,Octavi Obiols-Sales,XpICoc65uh0,0.13088235294117645,2019-09-07 20:04:23,False,False

Initially, I assumed the story was about a woman‚Äôs journey with a narcissistic mate, but after reading some reviews, I can TOTALLY see how it would be the Bible story re-imagined in a peculiar, creative, and out of the box way. BRAVO for Jen Laws acting and the directors vision. The film was both beautiful and disturbing beyond belief. It‚Äôs a work of art, which like most abstract pieces, are quickly dismissed by simple minded folks. The storytelling in this film was MASTERFUL.

Fuck me the audience? Fuck you the critics? Than who? I dunno. If youre a straight dude who still gets a boner in your wanger, watch the opening scene when jlaw wakes up in bed and practically walks around nude in see through pjs...then...turn it off and go watch an actual real movie that you like. Just to let you know, theres no more see through clothing after that. None. And the exposed breast scene in the end might not even be her tits to begin with cuz you dont see  her head attached to them its more of a downblouse probably her stunt double imo. Again.

It makes no sense isnt funny and isnt poignant in any sense of the word. me thinks darren arranofsky  prob had a big stiffy on jlaw and wanted to follow her nude butt around with a handycam in the beginning of the movie. than, he went in the closet on set in the big house and jacked his meat to the few minutes of footage while some ghost director filmed the rest of the movie which is why its so incoherent and meaningless. i dont blame him. while watching her at one minute fifty get out of bed and walk around in totally see through pjs i grabbed a couple a tissues myself!

2020-06-09T11:28:16,"It‚Äôs not about Christianity or just the Bible and it‚Äôs stories! It‚Äôs about religion in general and I also see shades of Hinduism in it. Shiva the creator the supreme god and Adi parashakti (supreme mother goddess) she is nature herself, she takes form of a woman ‚Äòsati‚Äô as a companion for Shiva, in Hinduism god created universe earth and nature cause he is inspired by her the supreme mother goddess or adi para shakti she is an inspiration she is essence of life. with her he creates the universe the nature. When you see that people are standing in line to meet ‚Äòhim‚Äô while the mother is leaving you can hear temple bells that‚Äôs what happen here in India people stand in big queues to see god and at every entry the bell is rung. Also the mother immolates her self. In Hinduism sati the wife of shiva and the supreme mother goddess immolates her self. Shiva carries her corpse which won‚Äôt reduce to ashes and finally when Vishnu destructs her corpse shiva visits the scattered pieces and makes them a source of energy for the people. Similarly in movie the mother sets her self on fire he carries her burning corpse in his arms and Roams around and at last he takes her heart and he regenerates everything with the help of that heart . So Similar to hindu mythology. Genius I have no words. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª",0,1,Meow Meow,XpICoc65uh0,0.008333333333333337,2020-06-09 11:28:16,False,False
