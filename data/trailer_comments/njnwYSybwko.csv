I feel that people need to understand that the whole east coast west coast feud was a big media thing and to show what was really¬†going behind the scenes from all¬†important/ critical¬†vantage points.¬†I mean yes people can do more research on the internet but¬†in this modern age what better way then to put it in a movie to inflict interest of a situation¬†to an audience, influencing them to go and do more of their own research. It was a big event just like the Rodney king trials, O.J. Simpson trials, L.A. Riots, Police brutality back in the 80s-90s, etc.  I mean look at the show, ""American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson"", I was alive during that time yet I paid no attention to it but I heard about it and knew alittle about what it was, yet I never took interest in it until the show came out and when I started seeing how the show was a big deal on media, before I watched the show myself I did my research first and watched the whole trial on YouTube and watched the first movie that came out about O.J. Simpson and then I watched the show and saw the things that were happening behind the scenes that you didn't get to see in the news¬†unless you were actually there. Yes a few things were off in the show but the concept and idea and knowledge on the bit of American history was very educational to me and made me see things from a different light.

The Snoop scene was little information. What happened to Dre? it was a clip less than a second.   The beef with Biggie seemed too short. The beginning took too long on his mom. It just was too draining. They should have used the same clip from Biggies movie where its the opposite of that moivie. Show Biggie getting arrested.

There was no follow-up whatsoever, even though he died in the hospital 5-6 days later in reality. There should have been a scene of his girlfriend finding out he got shot, because in the movie, he chooses to go to the club with Suge, despite his girlfriend being worried about him. It made no sense to create that scene whatsoever, because that's the last time you see her in the movie. There isn't even a scene of her finding out he was shot in the first place. The movie should've had a hospital scene where family and Death Row members visited 2Pac while he was in a coma. I believe there's an interview with Snoop Dogg where he says he visited Pac in the hospital and started talking to him because he felt that he could hear him, even though he was out cold. This should have been in the movie. It would've been more emotional, and in my opinion, way better than just the screen going dark right after he gets capped. That's just my two cents though.

Demetrius Shipp did very good playing 2Pac Shakur. The black guy who played Suge Knight did a good job. He kinda looks like Suge. I also like the black woman who played 2Pac's mom Afeni. I wanna have sex with Katerina Graham who played Jada Pinkett. She's hot. I also like the cute lightskin black woman who had a small part as r&b music singer Faith Evans. I like the cute black woman who played music producer Quincy Jones daughter Kidada. She was Demetrius girlfriend. I like her hair and her body. She used to play on Charlie's Angels tv show. I don't know her name. I saw Jamal Woolard in the movie as dead music rapper Notorious Big. I liked him in Notorious movie. I also saw music rappers Maino, Edi Mean and Young Noble of the Outlawz in the movie. Edi Mean and Young Noble were 2Pac's friends. I see in one scene that Demetrius tried to leave Death Row records to start his record company. Suge Knight prevented him from leaving because he owed Death Row money. I knew that was gonna happen because Suge doesn't let his music artists leave his company unless they pay him the money they owe him LOL. That's probably how Snoop Dogg, Dogg Pound, Lady Of Rage and Dr Dre left Death Row. I know they didn't get outta their contracts without paying Suge money they owed him. I didn't like the black guy who played Suge in the movie trying to prevent Demetrius from leaving Death Row. Demetrius said that he had done 3 albums which is what he owed Death Row. But that still wasn't good enough for him to leave. So the black guy who played Suge started a distribution record deal called Death Row East so Demetrius could work with New York music rappers.",0,0,Keith Witcher,njnwYSybwko,0.19240957966764416,2017-07-03 18:20:03,False,True

2020-06-14T09:20:15,"This movie is a disrespect to tupac. The biggest problem was there was just way to damn much they tried to cram into one movie, honestly scenes will play and just when your getting into something it just stops, then goes to a new place, new scene, and it's like this the entire way through, THERE IS NO DETAIL, the scenes aren't aloud to breathe it felt, as a result there are just too many characters that just come and go, you never really see connection with them all and it's just tiring because you never get to see exactly who everyone is and what they did with 2Pac.   One of the most saddest parts of this film, was the complete way they ignored his paranoid and prophetic part of Tupac. One of Tupac's defining traits toward the end of his life was his constant foreshadowing of his own death and his paranoia during his daily life. Songs like 'Only Fear of Death' and 'So Many Tears' are evident of this. He would rap about being reincarnated, coming back a ghost, and his funeral being empty. He would talk about being killed in his sleep and his complete distrust of all the people around him.  One other annoying thing I thought was how they got Money B, Noble, and EDI to play THEMSELVES, that was wack as hell and just screams inexperience and even low budget (even though the film wasn't really low budget) and to make matters worse, EDI, and NOBLE didn't even say any damn lines! THEY WERE THE OUTLAWZ! 2Pac's rap group and didn't even say anything in the movie!     What they needed to do was make this a TV series, a two part movie would have been better but not by much... a TV Series would have been perfect, there are just way too many great 2Pac moments that all need time to be explored and explained, a movie should have been out of the question from the very start...   and the whole suing of 2Pac's OWN MOTHER to get this done is absolutely bananas, and now that the movie has been released we can all see why Afeni (2Pac's mom) never wanted it done by LT... Real shame, 2Pac would be ashamed and disrespected! No lie 2Pac would probably have killed LT Hutton just for the fact that Afeni had a damn heart attack 2 days before going to court, its just insane, LT is probably the one responsible for her having that heart attack, just the stress of having to go to court could have killed her.",0,0,Anas Btr ‚ùº,njnwYSybwko,0.17067627494456766,2020-06-14 09:20:15,False,False
