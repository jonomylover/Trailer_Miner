2019-02-07T15:37:24,"Interesting how the original Shaft arrived in 1971, roughly around the time the civil rights era was winding down, and yet at least one of the women Shaft got down with was a white chick. Speed ahead to 2019 and black guys are a bunch of clowns told by their women and society that the only ladies they can display some sexuality towards onscreen are black chicks... and an occasional Latina. Which is why I don't want to see a black James Bond. Suddenly the only women that would be coming into the orbit of 007 all across the globe would be the fucking Dora Milaje. Where are your balls, black dudes? Any other race of men in a similar film that takes place in a racially diverse western country would be surrounded by a rainbow of ladies in such clips.",0,0,Hibbs4Prez,lD41XdWcmbY,-0.061388888888888896,2019-02-07 15:37:24,True,True

2019-02-07T17:15:12,"For yall newer people who sont know, Richard Roundtree starred as Shaft way back. This was the height of blaxploitation and Shaft cemented a lot of the halmarks of the genre. If yall watched the recent show Luke Cage youd notice a lot of the better non stereotyped elements of blaxploitation (like music, embracing a bit of corniness) were in it.  Now, Roundtree starred in three Shaft movies. The original is more so the cultural touchstone. In 2000 they actually remade Shaft starring the best man possible to play Shaft: Samuel L. Jackson. But notably this movie didnt “cancel” the continuity of the original Shaft as Jackson’s Shaft character was actually the nephew of OG Shaft and Roundtree even features in the 2000 Shaft movie.   So for those of you keeping track, this brand new 2019 Shaft movie has three generations of the family, original Shaft, second Shaft, and third kid Shaft. Which to me is hilarious as youve got the og Blaxploitation character, his “modern” more actionized version, and the third millenial version.",0,0,Jurassic Lion,lD41XdWcmbY,0.23625541125541127,2019-02-07 17:15:12,True,True

2019-02-08T00:15:29,"Dear friend, take comfort and joy in the fact that we can walk through each day knowing that ""the LORD reigns forever!"" For He lifts us up when we are bowed down.....An article in the Surgical Technology International journal says that looking down at a smart phone with your head bent forward is the equivalent of having a 60-pound weight on your neck. When we consider that millions of people around the world spend an average of 2-4 hours daily reading and texting, the resulting damage to neck and spine becomes a growing health concern.                                          It is also easy to become spiritually bowed down by the burdens of life. How often we find ourselves discouraged by the problems we face and the needs of those we love. The psalmist understood this weight of concern yet saw hope as he wrote about “the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them— who remains faithful forever. He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The Lord sets prisoners free, the Lord gives sight to the blind, the Lord lifts up those who are bowed down, the Lord loves the righteous” (Ps. 146:6-8).                                        When we consider God’s care, His great power, and His loving heart, we can begin to look up and praise Him. We can walk through each day knowing that “the Lord reigns forever . . . for all generations” (v. 10). Look to Christ Jesus by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Yeshua (Jesus Christ) into your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be sealed and justified in salvation. You will be blessed abundantly and your life will be forever changed!                                      Please be of good cheer in praying the following prayer with me....O Heavenly Father, lift our eyes to see Your power and love today so we can raise our heads and our hearts in grateful praise to You. You are the omnipotent, eternal God, the Creator who is forever faithful, benevolent, gracious, compassionate, and loving. This we pray in the Mighty Mighty name of Your Son, Jesus Christ, Amen!   May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️",6,5,msdogooder,lD41XdWcmbY,0.2973443223443224,2019-02-08 00:15:29,True,True

I won't be surprised if it's the best _Shaft_ movie ever (although honestly the bar is not that high). Looks cool and the writing doesn't look that bad. I really like the theme of the different generations of men in a family working together and mentoring one another. Looks like a cool and positive portrayal of masculinity and fatherhood. I almost said ""black masculinity"", but every race should be able to relate to this even though the characters are definitely black. Good stories have universal appeal, and so will this if they get the humanity of the characters right. I'm looking forward to this. I'd love to hear an old-school blaxploitation soundtrack, and not just modern music. Those groovy soundtracks were the best part of those movies. An intergenerational team of musicians inspired by the sound of the black bands of that era and their film scores (of course including Isaac Hayes) would really elevate this movie. They could totally get some great black musicians from the '70s that worked on the original movies to lead a band to create some old-school music, perhaps with a modern twist but not too much.",0,0,Paelorian,lD41XdWcmbY,0.24034304079758628,2019-05-25 18:27:58,True,True
