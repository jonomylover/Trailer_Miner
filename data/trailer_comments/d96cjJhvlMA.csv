The movie uses the generic plot themes from the big book of ""How to make a generic action sci fi movie"" and runs with it. No surprises there. There's an occasional attempt to make the characters seem three dimensional with feelings and depth, but it does not work. Best part of the movie is the excellent CGI, action scenes, and a green Zoe Saldana. Would have liked to see more green Zoe Saldana and less of the really annoying CGI racoon thing.

""The jokes were cheesy and lame"" or ""this movie is for kids"" Really? That's opinion based not factual you could ask several comic book fans that are well into their 30s and beyond if this was a good movie they'd say yes. Why? Because this movie gave us what we wanted from a marvel movie and summer movie. Great heroes which is what Marvel does best and great action/comedy.

2016-09-23T05:18:37,"I completely understand that Guardians of the Galaxy was just a movie. And I fully enjoyed it. It was much better than I or most sci-fi fans most likely anticipated. However, despite this movie technically being an action adventure comedy blockbuster, my heart was nearly ripped out in the beginning of the movie from watching the young Peter Quill witnessing his mother's final moments alive. That scene almost caught me off guard and was extremely a bit more emotional than anticipated. I don't think I have had a sci-fi movie hit me emotionally that hard since watching Luke Skywalker's last moments with his father Darth Vader when he lay dying in his son's arms. At the end of the movie, I enjoyed the solid friendship the team finally established with each other. That scene reminds me of some of my closest buddies I grew up with during my teen years. I thank Marvel Studios for producing such a nice movie that I am very fond of. There are a very few select movies I never get bored of watching. And Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely one of my select movies I will always enjoy watching over and over.  And last but not least, I loved how Yondu Udonta just smiled at the end of the movie on how he got played again by Peter Quill. I think the moral of that story is that deep down, Yondu knew that it was too dangerous for him to hold onto that Infinity Stone while in his sole possession.",214,9,Todd Sands,d96cjJhvlMA,0.10494301994301995,2016-09-23 05:18:37,False,False

I think marvel should give them their own show that would be cool. I have not heard of the villain Ronan the accuser but I knew of thanos and nebula they were in a game I had for the super Nintendo called war of the gems. which includes the infinity stones. and I knew of the kree from x-men. know that this movie came out they will be more popular. at least I think. this is a awesome movie and can't wait for the second movie.   if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do rating 5/5,0,0,David Smith,d96cjJhvlMA,0.2760822510822511,2017-01-29 09:26:24,False,False

2018-06-14T07:47:13,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is one of the greatest movies of all time. When I first heard of it, and saw the teaser, before it came out, I was very skeptical of it. I wasn't sure if it looked that good, and I thought it looked corny. Then I finally watched the movie, and I had an absolute blast!! This movie was not corny. It was amazing, and had awesome weirdness to it, with a loveliness to it that made me appreciate this movie. It is a fun, hilarious, sci-fi saturated, and action-packed extravaganza!! It was surprisingly touching at times, the sound effects, production design and cinematography were so excellent for this space universe that the creators of this movie created, it was visually amazing, and vibrant. And the music was just so great for this move. The music was perfect for this movie, especially when you find out how the music is involved in the story, I mean the music is already awesome, and the fact that the music itself even incorporates itself into the story is even more awesome!! The characters are so much fun in this movie, and all of the actors play their characters so perfectly. I love this movie so much. I'm giving this movie, 10/10 stars. 😀❤👽🕺💥🌌🚀🛸🎶🎬🔫🔮",0,0,Christian Trahan,d96cjJhvlMA,0.47876602564102566,2018-06-14 07:47:13,False,False

2019-12-01T03:56:59,"I said it before to my friends as soon as I & we all first watched this movie on it's original release but I didn't post my thoughts here in the comments section of YouTube but after watching it again tonight for only the 2nd time I can't be the only one who has seen & thinks that the 2 of the same weapons that the character Quill aka Star-Lord uses look so much like either the  Plasma Pistol/Plasma Rifle (or a mixture of both) from the weapons used by the alien Covenant being the Grunts & the Elites in the Halo franchise of game's!..  How they got that past the developer's of the Halo franchise is beyond me, unless they had already had a conversation with them about this & they didn't mind those 2 weapons that Quill always uses as any copyright issues but they sure as hell look very similar to (as I've said) the Grunts Plasma Pistol &/or the Elites Plasma Rifle...  I'm glad the actors stuck together & backed James Gunn over his remarks he made over more than a decade ago surrounding topics about rape & pedophilia...  Gunn had came out & apologised unreservedly & as apologetically as he could & was himself ashamed about the comments he admitted to making...  I'm not condoning what he said as it was pretty tasteless & nasty within the context he said his words but again I stress that he knee himself even back when he made those comments that they were a misguided & stupid unfortunate attempt at efforts to be provocative seriously backfired on him...  I've read those comments & they are or were out of order but again he was quick to realise that his remarks did not come off as he intended & even years after posting those comments & before he was hired to direct Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 1 & Vol 2 that even after a decade he still feels ashamed at the insensitivity & indefensible comments that he shouldn't have posted but in a world were we live in an almost Matrix like reality of always plugged into the internet ordinary people all over the world post comments that they regretted posting & wish they could turn the clock back...  I think Disney Studio's reaction at first was correct but when you take into account that he has tried to live this down ever since being so stupid enough to post such undefensible comments & are you trying to tell me that a company as massive & as long standing in the movie industry like Disney didn't know of these comments already & before they agreed to sign him up as the Director...  No 2 wrongs make a right but we must at least give someone a chance to redeem themselves & forgive such a stupid thing to do or no one would make or say comments about anything incase it's taken the wrong way...  Even if his comments were meant to be exactly what he wrote I think he deserves a chance at putting that behind & we can only hope that this was a nasty & unfortunate blip in his career & that Disney eventually withdrew their decision to have him removed from the 3rd Volume of this franchise of films...  Again 2 wrongs don't make a right but let's not forget how Walt Disney himself behaved towards his staff/actors & even those who wrote books like Mary Poppins by the english Helen Lyndon Goff who adopted the pen name of P L Travers aka Pamela Lyndon Travers...  By all accounts the story I heard & not the Hollywood movie version of Saving Mister Banks was that Walt Disney used every underhanded & at times disgraceful behaviour for decades to the author of Mary Poppins & spent 20 years of basically constantly harassing her & using any means he could to secure the rights to the book & as I've said just look into Walt Disney via testament from his scriptwriters/artists & overall staff members & this was not a man who was supposed to be this gentleman who made movies for kids but a tyrant who wouldn't take no for an answer & help mend you if you got on his wrong side but that usually always gets swept under the carpet & we are left to be told of all the great films to come put of his studio yet this was a man that we were told was painfully shy yet how did he create the legendary Disney Studio with his business partner & brother unless he was also ready to be a cut throat business man...  Point is we all make mistakes & some will continue to do so & act as if they are untouchable "" Harvey Weinstein "" ring any bells & this should always be kept an eye on but at least give someone a 2nd chance at redeeming something they will foolish to do in their past with regards to comments that seriously back fired...  No doubt Disney were jumping on the Me Too bandwagon & wanted to seem to come across as caring about what someone said over a decade ago, I don't think so, as Hollywood has only ever cared about Hollywood & what money someone can make for them & though I wholeheartedly agree with the "" Me Too "" movement & the disgusting way that actresses have been treated in Hollywood since films were first put up on the silver screen or on TV shows & the music industry also...  Basically anywhere where women have been treated disgustingly has to be stopped Now in every business & aspects of every day life, as it's not acceptable in any way shape or form & I'm surprised that it's taken this long for movements like Me Too haven't sprung up sooner but no doubt this was because said women feared for their careers & their lives & it has to stop & big examples made like Harvey Weinsteins of this world don't just lose their business but are put behind bars for life as that's the only way anything will change in an industry that feeds off of female actors like blood sucking leeches that think they are beyond & above the law...  Let's hope that James Gunn was exactly as he said & that was disgusted & didn't defend what he said but he can continue to do good things & turn his life around without comments made over a decade ago keep coming back to haunt them as if thats the case then a huge percentage of Politicians would soon find themselves fired also as they are always saying things that shouldn't be aloud yet they get away with it because of the power they have behind them...  We are all only human & I hope James Gunn spends the rest of his life contributing & continuing to make sure that He & others around him think before they write something & that doing something just for attention & a reaction doesn't make them spend the rest of their lives paying for their moment of madness...  Robert Downey Jnr is a perfect example of someone who did eventually go on to get his act together & has starred in this comic book movies but if we based what he did only from his past he wouldn't have been able to show & prove he has put those demons behind him & decided to get his act together...  If more was to come out from James Gunn in the present & future that was similar to  what was said in the past then I'd said by all means crucify him & he should never be allowed to direct or be in the business of making movies but again I stress we are all only human & very regrettable mistakes can & are made but it's how we move on & change our lives for the better of us & those around us that we should at least give someone a chance to prove they were in the wrong & can & did change their life around...  Its the old saying of "" He Who Cast The First Stone "" & giving someone a chance to turn their lives around & for what I've read & heard about the Director James Gunn this is what he has done & has regretted ever saying what he did on a social media site...  Let's hope that Guardians Of The Galaxy  Vol 3 delivers in the same way as Vol 1 & 2 as James Gunn was & is and has had a huge say in how successful they've been while being directed by him...  Only time will tell on all accounts of & on the topics I've  commented on & that we still shouldn't miss sight of the "" Me Too "" movement & to put a complete stop to this indefensible behaviour that female actors have had to endure for so many decades in the movie industry & in e very day life also...   .....",0,0,YouTube Is An Influencer,d96cjJhvlMA,-0.014313092661306936,2019-12-01 03:56:59,False,False
