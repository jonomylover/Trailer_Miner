2016-07-24T17:16:22,"Before I come to what I actually wanted to say, please remember that my comment is meant to express my personal opinion. I do not want to set someone. I'm just commenting on this video, well, because that's what a comment section is for. Also, if you did like this trailer, please keep in mind, that I did not call anyone names, or, let's say, 'butthurt marvel-fanboy/-girl'. To get this out the way, yes I prefer DC. But I enjoyed the X-Men-movies, and especially the Daredevil-TV-series, too, and I'm excitedfor GotG Vol. 2 (First one had magnificent Music, go, buy the soundtrack)!  I'll give anyone the benefit of the doubt and just presume, that no one here actually is the type, that gets mad at reading an different opinion. But these douchebags exist, and as we all know, debates about topics like Comicbook-adaptations oftenly become very heated very fast. (Especially when these debates take place between fans of certain comicpublishers.) That's just the way it is. It's a mad world. A world where I feel the need to apologize for stating my opinion unasked. Thumbs up if you find that sad. Just kidding, I don't write this because I'm afraid of a small amount of aggressive people on the internet, I just enjoy writing. But seriously, it is a mad world.  Soooo after all that introductory blabla, I shall now release my very important opinion onto an unsuspecting world: I found this trailer rather... meh. Too much shallow 'meaningful' talk (""I am Death""!!!). Too many confusing (but pretty) Christopher Nolan/Warcraft-lawsuit-CGI. And, hooray, it's a trailer that basically tells an jumpcutted origin story.  But here's the real reason why I'll not see this despite the terrific cast:  They changed an important character from being tibetan male to caucasian female all just too ensure avoid trouble with their humble costumer China, by not stating, that Tibet is an actual country. That would have been illegal in China, therefore, the movie would have most likely got forbidden. If they had just did that quietly, I would say, that's the business way, I wouldn't mind too much. (I'm a western ignorant after all). BUT not only did they openly admitt that they wanted to appease chinese censoring-agencys, they tried to defend that decision and wanted to sell that casting choice (Tilda Swinton=great actress nonetheless) as an example of Marvels ""great sense for diversity"". Now, that's what I call offensive! (Perhaps you, dear reader, do not. Feel free to discuss, if you've actually read THIS far. If so, gj)    Also, hey, ""I am death"" in a Benedict Cumberbatch movie?

At first I thought perhaps I'm getting too old for comic movies. Then I see this trailer. This is EXACTLY where comic movies need to venture.I don't see a comic movie, I just see a very interesting SciF film in this trailer. It's something that will appeal to many I think. It's just a trailer, but bearing in mind we are seeing some finished scenes here it's very clear Marvel Studios is creating content many leagues above what WB is doing with the DC Universe. I think what WB are creating with the DC characters feels forced, it feels trite and the characters portrayal from the way they are scripted to the way they acted just feel second rate to what we are seeing from Marvel. I say this as having no allegiance to one over the other. Suicide Squad looks pretty good, but other than that the other films just look second rate to me.",1,0,rmzzz76,HSzx-zryEgM,0.15239130434782608,2016-07-25 00:06:58,True,True

2016-07-26T00:26:56,"Many paths, but there is a way that is unique - maybe it consists of many paths .. consider, the count of monte cristo.. if his bad choices led him to meet the prisoner... or were those choices so that the prisoner might have company?... if by your fall you help another, is that fall to be regretted?...as some have said, We all share a connection..  Strange, or familiar? :   Sin, is an entity, like a virus, which is in  the flesh.  If you do evil, your desire will  be towards sin, and sin will rule over you :  See, Genesis 4: 7, kjv.  There is no sin in  Jesus and Mary, and there never was.  Do  you think She had ""earth parents""?  Did  Wonder Woman?  .. It is written that Jesus  condemned sin in the flesh.  And that we  being many members are one body - having  received his spirit.  Wherefore, it is a temporal  paradox.  For we were there with Him on that  Cross then, for His Spirit exists throughout  time, and we are His Body. And so when he died, sin became guilty,  was condemned, for only they who sin must die.   And that condemnation of sin, is like a ripple  in the space-time field continuum, (flesh being  the medium in which sin's dominion ends),  travelling both into the past towards Eden, and  forward towards they who have yet to be born.   But only in them who receive his spirit. .. It is  written that He will pour of his own spirit upon  all flesh, and whosoever calls upon the name of  the Lord will be saved.  And His Name is hid in  the Lord's Christ, as it was once hid in the Angel  who travelled with them through the red sea.   (What colour is red?  Are you sure?).  Israeli  archeologists may be looking in the wrong place.   Oh well, kind of a moot point, now that the Inheritor  is come, since it is written  that all things under heaven, including the land,  belong to Him.  .. Why does He allow the wicked to  reign over the land?  Well, why did He allow Job to  suffer?  See, Lev 25:23, kjv.",1,0,Kelly KitKat,HSzx-zryEgM,0.049999999999999996,2016-07-26 00:26:56,True,True

2016-07-26T00:40:43,"Continuum, looks like it could be ""killer""  but without an Intel Atom X86 chip, true  PC-like capability is NOT going to happen.   Intel wasted their resources pursuing the  Arm-Android marketplace, while Microsoft  sought to port Windows 10 to Arm architecture,  which is why the Lumia 950 runs on a Qualcomm  chipset.  Were they wise to do so?  For the  Lumia950 is NOT a  smartphone-PC, but only SIMULATES  the look and feel of a PC.   What Intel should have done was  ""port"" the Wintel strategy into the smartphone  arena.  But Intel's new CEO in an act which might be  described as suicidal or corporate sabotage, has  scuttled Sofia and Broxton, the new advanced Atom  chips from Intel, which could have helped Microsoft  give students and enterprises a reason to switch to  a Windows phone, by making Continuum a true  ""killer app"".  Maybe Microsoft should call Intel and  inquire about a Custom Foundry special X86 order?   I doubt this will happen because the  shadow government (""Dormamu"") desires the  people to be dumb as molasses, and so computing  power will be systematically taken out of the hands  of the masses.  Look at cars - They no longer have  needle gauges, but digital readouts.  Now, you cannot  SEE acceleration as the needle swings from 20 to 30  Km/hr, but only a single number that changes  moment to moment is seen.  You see the speed  at a given instant, but no longer get a sense of  acceleration.  A great computer does not always need  electricity to run.  Also, being able to roll up a window,  quickly, to keep a bee out, was much more preferable  to pressing a button and watching in terror as the  window slowly goes up at two centimeters a second.   Why is the good stuff now in the past, as Orwell  predicted it would be?  Bluetooth, wifi :  Ownership is  access.  It is a way of denying people private property  save on a needs only basis (""here are your living  quarters, uniform, gun and shovel, etc."") - ""sorry,  incorrect password"".

2016-09-07T20:41:34,"1:43 Avengers Tower. I love the little details like that that tie in all the MCU films.  Also quick theory. In Winter Soldier when Strange's name comes up as a target, I think right about then is the car crash scene.

And doctor strange is stronger than anyone on or that's ever been in the just league. Only person stronger than than strange is the world breaker hulk. And Scarlett witch on marvels side. But keep being a dc fanboy as it stands dc is getting that ass raped by marvel. Also bvs and suicide squad both sucked and don't try to say they were good because they weren't. And then there's the fact that marvel has yet to disappoint with their movies and there movies are Damn good. If dc didn't make shitty movies rotation tomatoes wouldn't he given them rotten reviews.

But It will be Dr. Strange only in name and perhaps the costume. I'm really get sick of these superhero movies where the world will end or New York is imploding. Why not have a superhero movie thats not a disaster movie, thats what made movies like ""Kick Ass"" and ""Deadpool"" so great.  I would love a Spider-man movie where Peter Parker is in high school, with normal problems and some goofy costumed villain comes along, and he's got to get medicine for his sick aunt.

2016-09-28T04:24:55,"I am really excited to see this movie.  I've been waiting since I read my first Doctor Strange comic in the late 70's.  I realize I'm dating myself here.  Grace mentioned something though about one of Nolan's movies.  Both Inception and the first Batman movie were great.  I'm a serious Batman fan too.  I cross the great divide a lot.  Any serious research though will show that Nolan ""borrowed"" heavily from other sources for both these movies.  I'm not surprised that it happened.  Directors have been doing this type of borrowing for a long time.  Grace even did a video where one direct sued another director because of it and surprisingly he won. ;) Borrowing is done heavily; suing is not.  I've noticed a serious problem though growing based on a lot of different youtube channels and internet research.  Example:  apparently at the most recent comic con in San Diego I believe, an artists drawing was given out for free and the artist didn't know about it.  It's great that its free it not great that various companies are taking advantage of artists by not crediting them nor asking their permission.  He said he would have been willing to sign them for free for those who had them.  There are a lot of other examples of this behavior all over youtube and the internet.  Feel free to research this subject yourself.    Are we all so ""dazzled"" by great movies that we are willing to turn our backs on the artists who drew our favorite super heroes or the artists that inspire/create/develop new artwork for these movies?  Yet we have no problem in stating a movie was a ripoff simply because it came out afterwards?  I believe it was in the 80"" two very similar horror/alien movies came out.  One was based on a great older book.  The movie came out second and even though the first movie borrowed heavily on the original story from the book, the movie based on the original story was claimed to be a ripoff.  Check it out.  It's not hard to figure out which movie I'm talking.  I'm sorry if you feel I'm being to general.  I'm not here to make people believe anything.  Just point things out.  People really need to do their own investigating and come to their own conclusions.  Opinions will be opinions after all.

And I find that rather insulting that the Ancient One is not being played by a Chinese actor, such as Chow Yun Fat.  But then, since Disney bought Marvel - the value system behind Disney corporation is zionism, eugenics, support for sodom even.  So expect them to remove that Judaic concept of morality from the Marvel Universe in favor of a strange religion.  Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is more what Dr.Strange is like.

Or maybe artistic vision had to be sacrificed. Not sure the right person was chosen to play the role of batman.¬†  Not to say Ben affleck is a bad actor but batman might have not been the niche for him.¬† Also anyone that doubted dead pool was going to be good seriously misjudged Ryan Reynolds talent as well as the director and rest of the cast and staff. Hopefully Marvels movie DR. strange will def be just as underestimated as [Dead Pool] was and turn out just as awesome.  There's my Rant.

Then after going to IMDB and seeing that the guy from ""12 Years Slave"" is playing Mordor which is dumb i hate it when they change the characters skin colour and/or gender like Jamie Foxx playing Electro, as he is suppose to be a white German guy who suppose to be Red Skulls son i believe but back to Mordor when looking for him i was looking for a green outfit so ofc when i saw Wet (Chiwetel Ejiofor i'll cal him Wet for short) i thought na can't be him also i thought he was a bad guy. So back to Kaecilius not knowing him and his ability's i found out that he uses magic and that Mordor trained him so either Kaecilius was a student of his and then he left or Mordor is pretending to be on the good side but he just blagging it (lying) so kinda plot hole to be honest, well i'll find out soon as i'll go to the pictures (movies) soon and fingers crossed for it to be a good 1. :D",0,0,Danny Barks,HSzx-zryEgM,0.024652777777777773,2016-11-01 16:08:23,False,True

However, I will be boycotting this movie and here's why: the screenwriter, director, and studio made the decision to cast Tilda Swinton as a character who in the books is Tibetan. They did this not because of standard lazy Hollywood 'whitewashing', (which is bad enough), but directly out of fear that even mentioning the word 'Tibet' would be so offensive to China that they'd lose out on the Chinese market. In the words of the screenwriter -- C. Robert Cargill‚Äî  ""If you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he‚Äôs Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.‚Äù  Well, Mr. Cargill. Tibet is in fact a place. And truth is truth, whether you choose to hide from it or not. So I'm taking the $20 I would have spent on your movie and donating it to Students for a Free Tibet instead.""   http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/world/asia/china-doctor-strange-tibet.html?_r=0",7,2,Rinzamo,HSzx-zryEgM,-0.05818181818181816,2016-11-01 18:41:54,False,True

I miss the days when Marvel used to take time to explain everything instead of picking a part in the story and going off from there. The first and second SpiderMan movies with Tobey Maguire are a good example, they start from the beginning and help you build a relationship with the characters. You learn the relationship between Peter Parker and Harry Osbourne, Peter and Mary Jane, Mary Jane and Harry, all of the above and Norman Osbourne and you can almost feel the tension when things start to heat up and fall apart. I mean Uncle Ben was in the movie for less than 30 minutes I think and I felt his death *DR STRANGE SPOILER AHEAD* more than I felt The Ancient Ones death, actually I think I didn't actually really care for her death.

Nightmare would be an awesome villain because he really loves psychological manipulation, and Stephen Strange has a lot of psychological weak points. Strange is hyper-rational, but Nightmare is hyper-emotional, so he'd be a great foil.  And Man-Thing is perfect for using as a fake-out villain. Marvel fans who actually know the character (which is not most of them) won't be fooled, but Joe Q. Public will totally buy that he's a monster and be shocked when he's revealed as a mystical guardian.  And you could even throw in Howard the Duck, who gets pulled through the Nexus to Earth.  Oh and use different and creative magic other than Kung fu! Plenty of existing heroes due martial arts. Be creative and have strange using curse spells, demon/ construct summongings, teleportation without sling ring. Start developing his relationships with magic entities like cyttorak by having him gain contracts to use their magic    Push the boundaries of pg-13 by giving derrickson creative freedom to make this a  more horror based non generic sequel mcu series.
