2020-04-12T15:18:58,"Hardy is easily one of the best actors around today and has been for a good while. I wish Hollywood wouldn't obsess about drug movings and gangs, these stories get made over and over and over again and they have run out of meaning. People pay to see them because either their young actors trying to learn how to play tough guys who buy the tickets for the one week that the movie opens or their lower class people who enjoy driving out to a theater and sitting in a dark space watching people get blown away on screen. I can only think that people lead very dull leads to want to actually go out and watch stuff like this. We have seen this story made hundreds of times before.  At least Hardy gets a decent check and hopefully saves his money by buying real estate in the Caribbean with it.",0,0,Julian No,Iy_ogNiryZ8,0.13707264957264959,2020-04-12 15:18:58,False,False
