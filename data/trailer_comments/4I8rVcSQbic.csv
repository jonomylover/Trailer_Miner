So it was written that Henley left The Eye and a new female horseman named Lula, played by Lizzy Caplan, was selected by Dylan to replace Henley.

This has been said in multiple interviews that I have watched. ALSO, at the end of Now You See Me 2 it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger suggesting that there may be a third movie coming into the franchise therefore meaning that if they were to call this movie Now You Don't there wouldn't really be a suitable name for the next movie (presumably).

But Now You See Me 2 leaves viewers feeling scammed. Full review Peter Travers Rolling Stone It‚Äôs an impressively starry cast, but sadly, this lacks the charm, wit and, yes, magic of the original.

Making his actions good > bad > good > bad then finally settling on good?? Meaning on so many occasions what they did as a result of his input was a waste of time lol! Completely lost the feel of the original :( felt more like crime fighting magicians. Such a shame cause they had so much material and story originality to work and expand on instead of trying to build it off the 1st and deconstruct that story which was perfect! Should of left the original alone!! And adding Daniel Radcliffe and Lizzie Caplan was a huge no no!
