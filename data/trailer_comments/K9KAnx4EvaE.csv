2013-12-17T02:21:38,"Alright, this is a long post and I apologize in advance, so here it goes...I am a huge fan of Tom Clancy novels and characters like John Clark and Jack Ryan. That being said I have a few issues here. The movie does look good, I won't deny that. But I can't shake the feeling that this is just an attempt to create a character that is on par with James Bond. Not complaining about it, BUT I do think it was done the wrong way. I don't see why they could not have picked a Jack Ryan book that Tom Clancy actually wrote or hell if they are willing to take the bold step of creating an entirely unrelated Jack Ryan story, why can't they just reboot the series with The Hunt for Red October (I even hate the idea of remakes, but I think it would be a safer decision than doing a movie that is not even based on a novel) The reason why I say that is make the character, cement him into our minds, but don't remake the image we already have of him with this new story first. If they are planning to do a series of movies they should have at least given us a novel based taste of the new Jack Ryan, then try something a little more risky so that we would already be on board. Also, they seemed to have made Jack Ryan much more of an operative than an analyst. Not so bad, but I feel it might ruin his character. Jack is known to face the problems head on, but he is also very smart about it and would carry the readers, or viewers, along while he solved the situation before he ran in head first. I love the action and I won't complain about it, but at the same time I hope it doesn't ruin the Jack Ryan we all know and love. and if Keira Knightly is playing Cathy Ryan like I think she is, she's also in deeper and even more involved than she should be novel wise. It's bold, and I am interested, but again I think this might be a possible ruin for her character. I have hopes that this will be good, but I am very speculative at the same time so *fingers crossed*",15,4,Agent Twenty-Six,K9KAnx4EvaE,0.14486258690804146,2013-12-17 02:21:38,True,True

So, who does the CIA put in charge of saving the economies of the free world? An unproven totally green recruit of course! After arriving in Russia, his huge bodyguard tries to kill him, but he killed the bodyguard instead. Ryan talks to Kosner in the park, and then goes back home to a now un-demolished apt and goes to sleep. He meets the bad guy the next day who no longer tries to kill him (for no reason), then returns to his apt to find his immature, insecure girl friend who thinks Ryan is screwing around on her even though he CONSTANTLY kisses her feet, soothes her childish emotions, asks her to marry him over and over, even though she constantly refused to wear her engagement ring in public.
