But the only description we have of Him while on Earth is from Isaiah: ""He had no form or majesty that we should look at Him, and no beauty that we should desire Him."" Were He as handsome as popularly suggested (the long hair is very likely false as well), the Bible could have said so since it does describe David as handsome.

I keep hearing that this movie is derived from a series. Passion of the Christ portrayed Jesus in a more real way. His whippings were real. The pulling out of his beard was real. The pushing of his thorns were real. All biblical. I'm looking at this trailer and there are so many things that are not biblical. Just one example: Jesus DIDN'T touch the water when He told Peter to throw his nets on the right side. He didn't have to. So why would you portray Jesus doing that? How does taking unnecessary liberties with the bible help people to know who He was? The Passion of the Christ movie caused so many people to get saved and give their lives to God, because technology was used to convey the suffering Jesus more likely went through. Was there mass everyday of shooting for all the cast AND crew with this movie? Obviously there was no real research done in preparation of this movie, especially if it's from a show that people have already seen.

Both are now heavenly priest, and heavenly tabernacle. but this implies that the ten commandments are in the most holy place in heaven and that the Seventh day is still the Sabbath just as it was for thousands of years before the Christ... Many people will hate and disagree with me, but it is not me you fight against, it is God. I did not set the Sabbath day, He did, He did not set Sunday as the Sabbath day, Man did. But me saying these things will change no ones mind, and may even cause anger to stir to life. God in his good time will give proof, the question is, when he gives proof, are you humble enough to change? or stubborn enough to resist change? proof will come, just like in the controversy of the date of the book of Daniel, God provided the dead sea scrolls to silence the opposition. when the controversy about the Sabbath comes front and center world wide, the Ark will be found and inside will be the ten commandments, those who are stubborn will say who cares, that is old testament, we live in the new testament.

So resolve upon your plan and [call upon] your associates. Then let not your plan be obscure to you. Then carry it out upon me and do not give me respite. And if you turn away [from my advice] then no payment have I asked of you. My reward is only from Allah , and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims.""And they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship and made them successors, and We drowned those who denied Our signs. Then see how was the end of those who were warned.Then We sent after him messengers to their peoples, and they came to them with clear proofs. But they were not to believe in that which they had denied before. Thus We seal over the hearts of the transgressors."" 10:71-74  ""And We have already sent Noah and Abraham and placed in their descendants prophethood and scripture; and among them is he who is guided, but many of them are defiantly disobedient.Then We sent following their footsteps Our messengers and followed [them] with Jesus, the son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel. And We placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism, which they innovated; We did not prescribe it for them except [that they did so] seeking the approval of Allah . But they did not observe it with due observance. So We gave the ones who believed among them their reward, but many of them are defiantly disobedient. 57:26-27  ""And We gave to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob - all [of them] We guided. And Noah, We guided before; and among his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the doers of good."" 6:84 ""Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. And we revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Descendants, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the book [of Psalms]."" 4:163  ""Those were the ones upon whom Allah bestowed favor from among the prophets of the descendants of Adam and of those We carried [in the ship] with Noah, and of the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and of those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Merciful were recited to them, they fell in prostration and weeping."" 19:58-59  ""He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus - to establish the religion and not be divided therein. Difficult for those who associate others with Allah is that to which you invite them.

He will say, ""Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.

And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise. I said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness. If You should punish them - indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them - indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. Allah will say, ""This is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness."" For them are gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, Allah being pleased with them, and they with Him. That is the great attainment.
