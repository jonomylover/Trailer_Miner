I'm not a hater and I don't like Marvel more than DC, but some feelings inside me about DC and JL is not good. Visual efects and action scenes, way better than any movie but DC is just kidding around with people, at least I feel in that way.

2017-03-25T15:57:21,I am usually very picky about my films but i liked suicide squad although i would admit it was butchered. I really enjoyed batman v superman despite critics mauling it and this film although not astounding looking i think it will be none the less entertaining. I don't care that DC isn't as good as Marvel at films. I just want to see my favourite superheroes come to life. Anything is better than nothing. I don't wana compare super hero movies i just want to be entertained and that is the point of a film.,0,0,Faylum1,OiAmnKUaNmc,0.31851851851851853,2017-03-25 15:57:21,True,True

I really question if this film will be able to properly establish three new characters, only one of which is well known in the public eye, while simultaneously juggling the idea of an alien invasion, Bruce putting together the Justice League, and possibly Superman's return.  I'm a huge fan of the Marvel movies, but I want the DC Movies to be good, healthy competition between companies stimulates both to do better. And DC shouldn't feel like they have to copy Marvel's formula, all the better they don't to appeal to people who don't like that formula. But with the Avengers, Marvel spent five films building up to it, setting up five of the Avengers in those films as heroes in their own right (Hawkeye got shafted). Thus when we saw them come together to stop a threat none of them could face alone, it was all the more epic and exciting to see these individual heroes unite as a team.  This, eh, seems it's trying to do too much too fast, shoving the entire Justice League in their third film. Again, I want this to be good, but I'm very skeptical.",15,7,DrakeyC,OiAmnKUaNmc,0.19721706864564006,2017-03-25 16:05:40,True,True

I wont let myself get excited for this until Wonder woman comes out and is good. The thing with the DCEU is they do everything backwards. Everyone know superman and batmans stories, but thats what they show. Not a lot of people know croc, the flash, aquaman, or cyborgs stories, but they dont show that, at least not yet, they might in the movie. Also marvel sets everything up, then they let it all come to fruition. Dc doesnt give us enough time to care about the characters before they just throw them into a movie. In batman vs superman you hardly knew batman. In suicide squad you barely knew any of the characters. hell they killed of slipknot for no reason. Now in justice league they have to set up 3 new characters and make us like them. This goes hand in hand with them jamming too much into one story. They had a batman vs superman fight and a trinity vs doomsday fight that wouldve worked well if they had enough time to fully flesh out both storylines. Instead they gave us a bunch of plotholes. For example, The martha moment, or Why does lex luthor and zod create doomsday, how did lex luthor know? In suicide squad they tried to fit in El diablos origin, deadshots motives, and Harley Quinns story in one movie. They could have had those 3 very bad characters have their own movie with some of the suoer heroes (simultaneously building up justice League) Then show Killer croc, captaim boomerang, and slipknot instead because they are pretty minor characters. They crowd ed to many new characters into it. Arguably the coolest character there was katana and she just got a ""oh and this is katana"" and didnt do anything. killer croc barely did anything either. Anyway thats why i wont get hyped",0,0,Fattydude66,OiAmnKUaNmc,0.10907166907166907,2017-03-25 16:14:57,True,True

The one thing missing was any sense of the dynamics within the team.  Will it just be like the Suicide Squad--a bunch of folks thrown together for a big fight?  That would be a fail.

2017-03-25T16:43:36,"The remake of the Beatles tune sucked something fierce, but the movie looks like it might be pretty decent. I do hope they attempt to make it a reasonably well written story and don't spend all their money on CGI.   The cast looks like it might be OK, but Ben Affleck is hit and miss, Gal Gadot has not done enough for me to say how she will perform, Jason Momoa is not a good actor barring his role in GoT, Amy Adams is amazing most of the time, Henry Cavill is a great Superman, and I have zero idea how Ezra Miller will do as Barry Allen.  The bit parts, I assume, by Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, J.K. Simmons, William Dafoe [although I hate Dafoe as an actor most of the time] should be fairly good, and despite others dislike of him I thought Jesse Eisenberg was a pretty good Lex Luthor Jr. [not that we have ever had cinematic comparison].  The trailer just wreaks of a ton of action, but no character development or deep plot generation, which makes me wonder why WB is so eager to pump this out. Doing the story justice would be better than throwing out a high action movie with no where to go afterwards, much like they did in Bat vs Sup [very weak story and writing. Eisenberg and Cavill saved that movie from being a total disaster because Affleck was just OK, relied way too much on CGI]",6,2,William Plain,OiAmnKUaNmc,0.2115666666666667,2017-03-25 16:43:36,True,True

With the Avengers we had a lot of time spent getting to know the characters, we knew a lot about each of them so we were invested in them. And while the Avengers suffered from a bit of cgi army madness this looks like it have the same problem in a much bigger way. This movie is gonna have to do a lot of character introduction and expansion on it's own, this isn't impossible, Guardians of the Galaxy pulled it off, but Age of Ultron couldn't make Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch interesting, and Suicide Squad really fucked up.  This movie is gonna be held to the same standard as any of the other superhero movies that we've seen, how interesting are the characters? How interesting will the villain be? Can DC really give us a villain better than any of Marvel's when they've mostly only ever got praise for a couple versions of the Joker? Is cgi gonna be relied on so much the action stops being grounded and intense? (I'm looking at you Hobbit/Age of Ultron/Will we get a decent plot? Will the charcters be faithful to their comic book routes? Is Batman really the best choice for the one cracking jokes? I mean the problem with DC hasn't been the darkness, it's been the prioritisation of spectacle over character. We've seen a mopey, broody, angry Superman when Superman is supposed to be about hope, and we've seen a murderous Batman when Batman's supposed to be about non-lethal justice.

2017-03-25T16:48:28,This will be a great year (for me anyways) for marvel and DC. Fanboys are rediculous. People act like marvel doesn't  have its problem when like at least one or two films from marvel are bad in each phase. Dc is great but it does have problems. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie were pretty bad in their roles but that's mostly due to the writing. Will Smith is an awful Deadshot. And I wasn't a fan that the death of superman and doomsdays creation was done so early I'd prefer if that was just in a man of steel 2 or 3 sequel. Also there are just nitpicks like why batman didn't just use kryptonite bullets to kill superman or how he knew   the fight between him and superman would take place in that building where he put the spear and not end up somewhere else. Overall I'm impressed for the most part with both universes for what they are.,6,1,Jon Richeson,OiAmnKUaNmc,0.05208333333333336,2017-03-25 16:48:28,True,True

2017-03-25T17:00:10,"The main problem I'm seeing is that it looks like they are going to try and put in a backstory for all of the characters (there are clips of Barry's Father in prison, Cyborg when he was young and on the football team) which a lot of the time what fucks up a whole movie, but who knows maybe they'll throw a curveball and it'll be some cool new way of putting it all together that it will make sense and be enjoyable and memorable. The second problem is that the fights and action scenes look like they are 110% CGI and that does make it quite annoying and not even mentioning that 99% of cyborg is CGI so I hope they at least find a way to balance it out or make it look realistic and not too in your face but that seems unlikely since there is so much background CGI that it blends with that I guess. And the last thing is the ""villains"" they definitely did a good job on not revealing the actual plot but rather just the heroes which is good, but it's starting to look a lot like they will just be fighting a bunch of minions like in the Suicide Squad where there is no real objective but they are just in the way and it adds a little bit of action.

The costume sucks, and when it comes to speed, this version is trying way too hard. Having so much lightning around(its not even yellow lightning btw), while the TV show version had the lightning around speedsters be simple. Sometimes, things just need to be simple. Not over-the-top.  Speaking of costumes, DCEU's Cyborg still looks terrible. It seems he's emo and shit like Superman in BvS(dont bother telling me his backstory, that didnt stop hin from having emtion in the original Teen Titans show). And damn, the robot face he switches to, just *completes* the Bay Transformers appearance he looks like. I might as well call him something else, like Decepticon reject, because that's not Cyborg.

2017-03-25T17:58:49,"I'm the biggest Marvel movie fan there is. I'm like an encyclopedia, no kidding. I'm not one of those one sided fans that 'has' to hate on the other franchise. This trailer was great! BvS and Suicide Squad were a little rocky but that's expected near the first portion of a franchise. As time goes by, the kinks will be sorted out, but you can't please everybody unfortunately. To say I'm the biggest Marvel fan ever and I'm admitting that this film is looking great shows something! In terms of superhero cinematic universes, I say the more the merrier, so long as their good, entertaining movies. It's not like I'm praying DC to fail. I don't want that at all. DC are having a harder time than Marvel mostly because their cinematic universe came out after Marvel's, so there's always scepticism when it comes to technical 'competition'... but here's a thought, how about open minds and optimism for a change? I hope DC smashes this film amazingly and takes its place alongside the Marvel giant. What's wrong with enjoying both? Let's face it, the majority of flame war mongers are sweaty nerds tapping away on keyboards. Coming from the biggest Marvel fan out there, I say to those people, get a grip, you can enjoy both, and people can just enjoy DC, people don't have to like Marvel like I do, nor do people have to keep comparing them, because it's simply unfair and pretty pointless.

I LOVE DC - way more than marvel - but marvels movies have been 10X better. :/ EDIT: The reason I say character development is weak, over half the league is being introduced in this movie. Whereas in marvel nearly everyone had an origin movie where we got to know the character. I'm also referring to the last movies by DC Superman V Batman and Suicide Squad - both of which could've been much much better plot/character wise.  This movie in a sense already began - with the SvB movie. They should've done Diana's movie first and a batman movie, and then these, not the other way around.

I believe the reason why the action is at night or on dark clouds is because of Batman??? Marvel always has scenes that are during the day and sunny because it looks better and what marvel character only fights at night?  Now people complain that there is no story on this trailer. That is actually a good thing lol. Less story the better. Remember how they gave away so much on BVS trailers.

2017-03-25T20:01:47,Alright let's be real honest here. Aside from this whole D.C. Vs Marvel crap (although I am going to say I'm more of a marvel fan even thought I love the darker versions of D.C.) this movie looks just a tad bit better than BvS. Now the whole problem with D.C. Is that they didn't take their time to establish their characters like marvel did. They saw they were being completely wiped out and they hit the emergency button. But I also think the main problem is zack Snyder being in charge of this whole universe. He's honestly overrated and his best work was 300 (yes even better than watchmen). I believe man of steel had everything to be great I mean the storyline was amazing (thanks mr. Nolan) but Snyder just couldn't hit the mark. I've always thought D.C. Should stay with the dark versions no need to change anything just have the proper people in place to deliver. I mean come on the biggest red flag was having that scrawny lex Luthor. Then an older batman? I mean come on.

Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""‚Ä®The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. ‚Ä®‚Ä®After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!‚Ä®With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

After so many years of defending the DCEU and being blindly optimistic and hoping beyond hope that Snyder could right the ship for JUSTICE LEAGUE before he sinks the entire DCEU.... but this trailer is just proof he has absolutely no idea what we want from a JUSTICE LEAGUE movie. This feels like BvS part 2, but with an even more unfocused vision. This movie is going to be tonally all over the place, like as jarring and unpleasant as if King Leonidas started make pop culture reference jokes in the middle of a fight scene. This movie JUST DOESN'T GET IT. Snyder just doesn't get it.  GO WATCH A SEASON OR TWO OF THE JUSTICE LEAGUE ANIMATED SERIES, READ A COUPLE COMIC ARCS..... How is he [frick]ing up the Justice League this bad? Nothing, and I mean nothing about Justice League feels really or authentic or natural or genuine.

2017-03-26T13:47:56,"What is with this hate to DC movies? This isn't Marvel, DC focuses on the plot/story more than Marvel does, and Marvel focuses more on the entertainment value. I've watched more than enough Marvel movies to know that they are awesome thanks to the animation, comedy, badass spectacles etc., never really for how interesting the story is. It's always 'When is Iron Man gonna kick ass'. The only Marvel movies that I found had an interesting plot was the X-men and Civil War. The rest were really mediocre to bad imo. Villains are cheesy, heroes are cheesy or are generally funny, plot is horrendously predictable even to people who haven't read the comics etc.  I love DC movies mostly cos of the character's backstories, the development of the heroes, the well-designed villains, emphasis on moral ambiguity and then emotional/powerful fight scenes. I have to yet to see a Marvel movie that captures these elements that were in say Nolan's batman, Man of Steel. Of course some DC movies like Green Lantern are complete failures or Suicide Squad that was a bit overhyped but I still like DC movies about the same that I do Marvel.  Is it so hard to realise these are different comic book companies with different styles? I'm sure that if everything was the opposite and there were more DC releases than Marvel, most people would piss on Marvel for being childish. I don't personally care, I only see good movies and bad movies - not 'DC is so shit', 'Snyder is a scrub'. There are DC movies I hate, there are Marvel movies I hate.

You can have your opinion about the JLA but everyone knows who Batman Superman Wonder Woman and Flash are, plus theres the flash tv show for those who watch it that gives us his origin story and as for Cyborg well in the trailer we see him playing football so we will obviously see how he became Cyborg since he is a little less known.

Cyborg should have been done more like deathlok from AOS x even recently the flash has had savitar in a suit and not predominantly cgi. Dc still rules tv and marvel the movies. The problem is don't always use Snyder. You can see how well done the tv series are done so use these guys. The helbings who do flash and black sails should be brought in along with Kevin smith and some of the writing staff to flesh out this story. Dc are to busy trying to catch up with marvel. Forget marvel and start building up these dceu properly. Don't do a new52 x if dc want they could have the flash from the movies make a speed force appearance on tv or vice versa as a one off crossover to show the parallel earths.

2017-03-26T16:41:03,"It's funny how people think Batman's origins are direct rip-offs from Iron Man's, or the Justice League copying from the Avengers... Let's make this perfectly clear, Superman was the 1st superhero, Batman the 2nd, then Wonder Woman... Aside from Captain America, the vast majority of Marvel characters were copied and created years later to compete or defeat their DC counterparts... And yes, DC has copied from Marvel too but never with their mainstream characters as Marvel proudly admits... I myself am a huge fan of the Incredible Hulk, a clear and utter rip-off from Solomon Grundy but instead of showing hatred toward the character, I give the Hulk love but when it comes to any DC property, all y'all can do is jump on the Marvel hater bandwagon... We all know that DC has had a rocky start with their 1st three cinematic movies garnering lukewarm or just outright, horrible ratings... No different than the 1st Captain America movie and no, not talking about that corny ass-fest from the 80's... Anyone with 2 brain cells could see that movie was some butt cheeks, but as time pasted, Marvel was able to redeem itself by giving us in my opinion, the best movie in their shared universe, Winter Soldier... So please, don't be so quick to point out the flaws in the DCU without pointing out Marvel's 1st... Case in point, look at the 1st Iron Man movie... An outright classic if you ask me but part 2 & mainly 3 were trash (part 2 wasn't nearly as bad as 3 though) but instead of a public out roar, they were praised like the 2nd coming of Jesus... I like both studios but I refuse to sit here and pretend like everything Marvel dishing out is gold and deserves praise while DC properties are trash and deserves to be bashed... Still, the bigger picture is that we as comic book fans get to see our favorites heroes on the big screen...

I remember most comments being ""No we don't want it"" ""We have seen it so many times"" ""Same old theatre shooting crap again""  So people have a problem when an origin story is given & they have a problem when it is not given. WTF!  Marvel gives a origin story everytime because, it is simple, most people around the globe don't know who marvel heroes are/were. The most popular one I can think is Spiderman (3 different franchises, everyone with a story of Peter Parker becoming Spidey)  Whereas most people know Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash. And look in the past as to how many movies have been made about Bats & Sups.  I simply don't think that those two need anymore backstory/origin story.

Hopefully this movie will give us enough time to get to know the characters; too many new faces and a new plot can seem overwhelming in just a 2 hour time window. Last but not least, who is the antagonist here? Looks like a bunch of 'lord of the ring' type, mindless monsters launching a war for the world. If you're going to follow a recipe, at least start with identifying who's the actual threat to our world and existence, then follow with the assembly of this super group so that we'd understand the need for so much muscle and so many over-blown introductory entrances in slow-mo.",0,0,Middy Mizzle,OiAmnKUaNmc,0.0768270944741533,2017-03-27 10:22:11,True,True

I enjoyed Captain America: Civil War because the trailers were so different from what happened in the actual movie.  I hope they sort of do the same here with Justice League because this trailer is a bit too reminiscent of other films such as what appears to be a training montage a la X-Men's Danger Room, and a distant battle scene that looks like it came from Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.

2017-04-01T19:17:50,"Hmmm... while the sfx and character designs look top notch, I get concerned about having too many characters in a movie. I liked The Avengers movie because there wasn't much of a need for character development. There were still parts, but the characters were established. And only one main villain with an army.  BvS fell short (in my opinion) because it tried to introduce Wonder Woman, and instead of keeping Lex as the main villain, they brought in Doomsday, which could have been its own movie. It introduced characters without much development. It's one of the reasons I hated Spiderman 3 (Venom... *sigh*) and ""Batman & Robin"".  I think Justice League might be falling in that same trap. Introduction of major characters without movies of their own prior to develop them. And it LOOKS like there might be multiple villains as well. Hard to say from this first trailer, and not a major comic book guru, so it looked like Aquaman was fighting in the ocean (against his own kind? Not sure) and I can only assume Apocalypse foot soldiers? Is there going to be multiple major villains?

Whilst Marvel has a lineup and a set timeline, they are slowly bringing in characters before they make their debut in their crossover films. DC on the other hand has pumped out the movies from their most famous comics and have failed in the process of doing so. By this logic, DC hasn't developed many characters and their movie will be so stretched out due to the desire to build characters that their movie will slowly run dry (this is definitely evident in Batman v Superman where they debuted Wonder Woman in a crossover movie before they made her solo movie.) I'm not against DC making movies this way, but they make it seem like they rush too much instead of creating a foundation for every character and then making a movie crossover.",0,0,Kian,OiAmnKUaNmc,0.044871794871794865,2017-04-27 16:04:39,True,True

This movie is just gonna throw a bunch of undeveloped characters at us at once, and there is absolutely no build up to them joining together. They've had cameos, which were very out of place, but it ain't enough to warrant them teaming up. Batman v Superman tried to do too many things at once (like Doomsday for fuck's sake), and the reason for Batman and Superman to fight was incredibly flimsy. Not surprising considering it was only the 2nd DCEU movie. MCU gave each Avengers member their own movies before teaming them up, and used several movies to build up to them fighting amongst themselves in Civil War. DCEU has their priorities completely ass backwards, and at this point, this series may not be salvageable. They wrote off Green Lantern right from the get go, but it's too late to reboot things after that god awful Suicide Squad.

2017-05-25T20:37:31,"Marvel fans, please let us watch the trailer without you butting in and comparing this to Avengers. Yeah, we know DC sucks when it comes to movies, and the fact that you keep rubbing it on our faces is just disgraceful. DC's not perfect, and neither is Marvel. Comparing DC's bad movies with Marvel's good movies is unfair. Why not compare DC's bad movies with Marvel's *bad* movies, and DC's *good* movies with Marvel's good movies? You criticize everything in a DC movie, and yet when Marvel screws up, you're just like, ""Who cares? We can let that slide, 'cause Marvel's still the best."" It's just so disheartening. It's hard to enjoy the trailer when most of the comment section are negative. If you're just a Marvel fan here to diss this trailer, just please stop. This is one of the reasons why the comment section's full of bullsh*t. Stop baiting DC fans into a social argument, an argument I deemed is just useless. So Marvel's better when it comes to movies, but have you forgotten that both Marvel and DC aren't just this action-packed, flashing lights, CGI movies? Both have pretty good animations, tv shows, comics, games, and others. Saying that Marvel's amazing and DC sucks because of the movies isn't f*cking fair. Take every dimensions into consideration, not just the movies. You'll realize that *BOTH* are good, great even, but none of them is the best. It's because both have their ups and downs, and you people (now I'm talking to both *DC and Marvel fans*, not just Marvel) should realize that both are equals! Both Marvel and DC are great! Try and respect both companies, and support them equally rather than wage a war where you'll just split all fans up! There are some people who are fans of both, and few of them are conflicted because of this so-called Marvel vs DC war. Instead of making it worse for the other fans and comparing it to other movies, watch the trailer or the movie as itself! Not some mirror or something you can compare to others!  So stop with the nonsense that's ""Marvel is better,"" ""DC is better."" Because, I'll repeat it again, *both* are great. It's time for you to *ACCEPT THAT FACT*.  =~= That's all what my rant is.

Not crazy about Affleck as Batman though, as far as that goes.  My thoughts on the DC universe: I am excited for Wonder Woman. Can't wait. But it seems to me, just my opinion, that Warner Brothers is rushing this DC thing. Aqua Man looks badass in this trailer. Why not make a great Aqua Man movie first. Same with the other characters, just like they are doing with Wonder Woman. I'd like to get to know the characters first and make an attachment to them, just like with Iron Man/Tony Stark.

DC's pathetic attempts to keep up with marvel have been sad.  Their even copying marvels the style of marvels trailers in here.  However I am exited a for wonder women and I see review are already out showing so far a 8.5 on imbD.  They should be making good movies push out other unsung characters and not these weak marvel mimics.  Marvel  didn't just randomly decide to mash these characters up.  They had the avengers and infinity war planned since iron man.  Marvels been giving these characters spots in other movies before making avengers.  DC's been relying to much on batman for too many years.  BvS shoud never have been made.  Instead they should maybe made gave some of these other characters the spotlight or made another superman movie or wonderwomen coud have came out earlier.  They should be themselves and not try to copy marvels style.,0,0,benjamin roseman,OiAmnKUaNmc,-0.05000000000000001,2017-05-30 14:51:25,True,True

2017-07-23T19:24:13,"Its so clearly not Superman lol, how stupid can people be. SuperMan basically died in BvS. How would Bruce be talking to a graved Superman??? He wouldn't be. In most JL plots, they have to find a way to neutralize Superman until they need him for doomsday or darkseid level villians. Snyder brilliantly set this up, by not only incorporating the death of SuperMan but nuetralizing him in the process to setup this JL movie. To me it has to be Martian Manhunter, lex Luther in robot suit, or some other they haven't introduced. My theory is this. No one we currently know shakes the ground when they walk. This eliminates basically every original 7 JLer. Alfred in the preview looks like he is looking at an alien, or definitely something he hasn't seen before. But here is the kicker... remember the dreams Bruce was having in BvS? Martian Manhunter could have been telepathically communicating to Bruce and Bruce perceived them as dreams, however they aren't just dreams they are warnings implanted by MM. My guess is that boom tubes hit Mars, MM's race/civilization was destroyed and the lone survivor MM was telepathically trying to warn Batman of what's soon to come to earth, depicted in Bruce's nightmares from BvS. Why else would Batman be searching for ""others"" in the preview.because he eventually realizes that they weren't just dreams and realized hes gonna need help. Maybe Bruce touches a mother box at some point or some artifact that triggers something like how Lex touched the one in that old busted up krytonian spaceship. IDK, but If you watch the animated DC movies/shows you know what I'm talking about cuz the same thing happened in JL frontier I think it was. Also I really don't get why people hate on BvS, I thought it was a ingenius start movie for DCEU. A bit long, but everything seemed warranted. I thought is was a great movie with an even better final fight scene sequence. Maybe it's just me but I prefer the deeper/darker/complex less Disney filter and overly joke-y marvel movies.",0,0,Trust Corps,OiAmnKUaNmc,0.09666666666666666,2017-07-23 19:24:13,True,True

2017-07-25T01:53:49,"Marvel Studios made SEVENTEEN movies before bringing all their heroes together for Infinity War. DC, on the other hand, made Man of Steel and Wonder Woman, two solid films, and then rushed through Suicide Squad and BvS so they could a contender to stand against Infinity War (Justice League). Come on DC! The future of these movies looks weak. As good as this movie looks, DC has fantastic heroes that deserve solo movies so they can be fleshed out BEFORE they hurriedly throw together their big crossover flick. Don't get me wrong, I love both Marvel and DC, but Marvel is KILLING it with their Cinematic Universe right now. DC has some of the greatest superheroes of all time and it pains me (as I'm sure it pains many other fans) to watch these films get rushed into theaters when there are SO MANY good storylines that could have been made before Justice League. Here's how it should have been: 1. Man of Steel 2. The Batman 3. Wonder Woman 4. The Flash 5. Man of Steel 2 6. Green Lantern 7. Justice League 8. Green Arrow/Black Canary solo film 9. Aquaman or Cyborg solo film 10. Batman 2 11. Suicide Squad 12. Wonder Woman 2 13. Flash 2 14. Shazam solo movie 15. Supergirl solo movie 16. Justice League 2 and so on  DC has SO MUCH POTENTIAL and it hurts to see everything so rushed into the box office just to compete with Marvel. Just slow down, DC!

You may feel inspired by them but psychologically these films make humans seem puny. We are not we are potentially the universe. They can make your life feel insignificant, dirty and difficult. Even weak.  Superman is of course Hebrew ie Judaic.  What is Hebrew? A  member of an ancient people living in what is now Israel and Palestine and, according to biblical tradition, descended from the patriarch Jacob, grandson of Abraham. The tribe of Jacob is ofcourse the origin of the Union Jack.   Superman's real name is Kal-El, son of Jor-El. The suffix El, of course, means ‚Äúof God‚Äù in Hebrew, with Kal-El defined by some as ‚ÄúVoice of God.‚Äù Before Krypton's doom, Kal-El's parents put him in a Moses-like basket, sending him down the Nile of intergalactic space until he landed safely on Earth. Moses is Akhenaton, atonist is another word for This Pharoah. The amenists didn‚Äôt like the atonists. The Levites didn‚Äôt get on with the Benjamin‚Äôs. Freud in his last book identifies Moses are really Akhenaton.   Now wonder women has been recreated as not a curvy cool chick but a solar god in the vein of Jesus. Look at the solar cult headwear and she's Israeli ... gal gadot = translates as river bank -- ie the banks , the bench , maritime admiralty law. It‚Äôs all hidden in the allegories.   Kronos - god from Greek ie Zeus ie moloch; which is a Phoenician god. Ok it all goes back to Egypt and masons now. The Venetian genose and Swiss, the Fondi. They are  same Pharoic people family lines. They‚Äôve taken the comics and made them luciferian, Saturn/ satanic. Enjoy !
