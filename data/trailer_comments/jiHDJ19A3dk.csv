There are still some pieces missing in the puzzle. I like how the director kinda  give a away who was the hijacker in the middle or close to the end. When the black guy said he knows how to hack phone, obviously that's what he'll do to the federal air marshall.  I like how the director put some obstacles, such as so many suspicious faces and like always. If this movie was just all about typical travel then it would be boring. The director have to put some kind of situation where hackers, but good idea making this movie after 911 terrorist. In reality speaking, there are crazy movie out there can actually do crazy things like this.  i give a five star.... good movie.. not bad..

The double standard of do as I say, not as I do. But what is primarily upsetting is the fact this movie. Portraits United States veterans, as a threat to the safety and security of other Americans. And as Mr.Nelson line his pockets with cash, and being a naturalized American citizen himself, it is apparent he cares little about our veterans, or the well being of this nation. His strong words against guns and the violence he seems to have profited very well from. I as a Native American would ask this bleeding heart to please go back where it is he came from as he is not only in conflict with those who have paid the ultimate price for our freedom and liberty, but also he is a disgrace as a member of my nation.  ",2,0,ward hubbard,jiHDJ19A3dk,0.1306372549019608,2015-02-24 18:32:59,False,False
