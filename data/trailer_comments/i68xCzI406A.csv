2019-06-26T14:24:46,"There is no ""aliens"", but what's really going on is there preparing for YAHUSHA HAMASHIACH who we call ""Jesus Christ"" to return and destroy all the wickedness on the planet. And they are pushing this aliens thing to make us think that it's some horrible thing coming to destroy us and our way of life. But really HE'S coming to destroy the workers of iniquity (sin). So we will be fighting against our own Creator thinking it's some aliens. How else would you get the people to fight against YAH (""GOD"")!? But the kicker is that we now know that YAHUSHA HAMASHIACH and HIS angels are ""black"" melanated men! The Scriptures says in 1 John 3:2 ""but we know that, when HE shall appear, we shall be like HIM; for we shall see HIM as he is""  This is why they always have a black man as the leading role in most of these films. And if u notice at the end when the news was reporting the arrival of the ""aliens"" in the football stadium, if u look at the bottom of the screen on the news report it says ""reenactment of first encountered"" so they show us the humans, marching soldier's with their flags parading and circling around the representation of the alien, and who was representing the aliens!!?? !A BLACK ALBINO MAN! Now they couldn't be to obvious and flat out put a black man there! So they had threw you off by making him albino, and there for it has you scratching your head like what is this!??... what am I seeing!!?? what's going on here!??.. And you notice the garments he was wearing like ""Christ"" and how he had his arms up in the crucifixion position! But the kicker is when the space ship was coming down from the heavens and the lady was singing  ""Glory Glory HalleluYah"" And if anyone knows Hebrew and the Bible you would know exactly what she is singing ( HalleluYah means ""Praise Ye YAH"") YAH is GOD'S true name in Hebrew. This is why she was singing that song! And also what you are seeing taking place in this scene is  In the Bible when YAH would appear it was considered HIS glory! And the mountain looking spacecraft coming down was representing New Jerusalem coming down from heaven ""Revelation 21:2""  If you learn the Scriptures and watch these moves it is all there! You just have to know what you are seeing and hearing and what they are showing you and what they are programming and getting us ready for!",0,2,KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS AND LIVE,i68xCzI406A,-0.03281366870127909,2019-06-26 14:24:46,False,False

First I had it on vhs, later dvd, and now soon bluray.  I just guess some people here, are they who actually need to get every minute of Long Kiss Goodnight too, or they don't get the plot of itüòÖ  This movie looks very good, something about mass control, among humans, and at top the aliens. And there is always someone who will fight against it, even if they will win or not. They believe to control humans, but at the end, you can never control the will of a man. Not just in a story, but in every possible situation. Maybe that is also a reason I love sci-fi like this. The rebels mostly show the real power among the humans, and even in a sci-fi story, most actors, usually, try to do their best performance.
