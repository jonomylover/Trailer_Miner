2018-10-15T19:18:25,"Why is everyone complaining about the inaccuracies? Who cares? Obviously the movie is most likely historical fiction which is a common thing. Also, this apparently isn't the first adaption that shows Mary and Elizabeth meeting. Also did it ever occur that the meeting just might be a dream sequence? Might not be but even if it isn't, Elizabeth stated here that they are to meet in secret so that might explain why it's never been written that they have met. I'm pretty sure they have them meet for entertainment purposes for the movie but at least the movie makers seem aware of how it's been known they have never met. I mean there's a lot of historical movies that aren't always accurate so it not it should be a huge shocker that this movie isn't totally accurate. For instance, other movies depicted Mary as having brown hair when she actually had red hair, it's been shown that Anne boleyn appeared frightened and crying during her execution when in fact she was brave and happy to die. The point is that we can't always expect perfect accuracy. If you ask me, the only things I've found to be more accurate are the documentries. I honestly just really don't care about the inaccuracies. Maybe that's just me. I'm sorry for the rant.

At least it opens up things for ppl to talk and discuss and correct- the uhm- mistakes.    I guess it's kind of fitting- that Mary Queen of Scots was able to bear the heir that Queen Mary I of England and Queen Elizabeth I - simply couldn't.    I don't think that King Henry VIII or his daughter in Queen Eliz I were remotely Christian in how- they treated people, especially how they treated the Catholics.  And yes- even the protestants- whatever they may be of the the anglicans- the lutherans, etc...  they ALL are called to be christian and act it in their schism- then and now.    And it's not to say Mary's son (of this film) King James I- was a ton better to the Catholic people either.  But there was- some progression.  Most people already know him for his KJV version of the bible- the King James version- that version does come with the 'stamp' of his approval.  He pretty much upheld the previous rulings that Catholicism was to be outlawed.  Yet he does relase St Edmund Arrowsmith and some other Catholic Clergy- in a period of amnesty.  Of course St Edmund Arrowsmith would later be murdered as an outlaw- under the rule of King Charles I...",0,0,Jim G.,riSROsdT-f0,0.15570175438596492,2019-05-15 23:43:01,False,False
