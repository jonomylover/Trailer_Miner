The old show and the 90's reboot the guests did have dangerous fantasies but usually had a reflection and left the island to be better people.  Still a case of 'careful what you think you want' situations and did have some dark turns but also some silly ones (variety of different fantasies meant different takes and style to them).  This seems to focus only on the horror and dark side aspects. Don't know if Mr. Roarke wants the bad things and final outcomes to happen to the guests out of evil/ritual or does want to help the guests overcome their psychological situations with the island's magic even if it might be dark or even dangerous.  I predict the mother will learn to let go of her lost daughter.  The other lady maybe to forgive and let go of her revenge that will end the fantasy and have her leaving to connect that woman to have a healthy talk.  The others I'll have to discover a bit more context to the fantasy and what sparked it.",88,4,AngelJD,a6O30nJ02PU,-0.046590909090909086,2019-11-11 18:20:34,True,True

True, some of the stories were dark, but you also had lighthearted stories as well, sometimes in the same episode as a more serious story to break the tension.  And the overall tone of the original show was lighthearted, what with the interactions between Mr. Roarke and Tatu. This remake clearly did not care for its source material and just wanted to use the name and setting to make a cheap run-of-the-mill horror movie.  And if you think it's not possible to tell stories of various genres in a single movie, look at The Twilight Zone movie from 1983, a movie based on a classic anthology TV show that told stories from a variety of genres.

They screwed up a great TV series and turned it into a horror movie just like Banana Splits becoming a horror movie. 😂  Famous actors and actresses would make special appearances and have their fantasies brought to life.

I see this hitting Redbox in three months after it’s release. What’s next? Happy Days?

2020-02-15T12:13:56,"I can't take this seriously due to 7 rings. The song is catchy but has no place in this trailer unless it's a cheesy comedy. Ariana is portrayed thus far as a disrespectful, spoiled diva. With a voice that could shatter glass (in a bad way), make anyone's ears bleed & earns her the title of a living dog whistle. It turns me off to the movie completely & makes me wish I'd gone deaf.  Sony, If in the 1 in a million chance you see this, I love Blumhouse but, Instead of horror, a psychological thriller, or whatever it's supposed to be, it reads as a bad joke. If hilarious stupidity is what you're going for, mission accomplished.   Lord Of The Rings, Jurassic Park, Jaws, The Breakfast Club, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, etc. Are timeless classics & an important part of that are their scores. Summary; Marketing research exists for a reason, I feel like some old, rich white man was like, ""now THIS is what the kids are into! The annoying, second-rate carbon copy of Mariah Carey from nickelodeon who's (like all childhood actors) doomed to fail"".    IMPORTANT NOTE!    Before you get your panties in a twist, please understand this. I truly believe childhood actors aren't handled properly & many times their worst personality traits are unjustly magnified by paparazzi vultures & more than likely aren't their own fault due to being used, abused, neglected & exploited by their own family or others in the industry at a very vulnerable age where they're thrown into a fast-paced, stressful & (many times) toxic lifestyle for any child under 18 way before they should be asked to make important life-changing decisions for themselves to shape their future. Many times they are forced into giving answers & consenting to things that even some adults don't fully grasp or understand. Ignorant or just flat out greedy parents/guirdians sign their child's life away in the form of (practically) legal slave contracts to large corporations who milk them for wealth. They're thrrust into environments where, without proper supervision they're exposed to harmful coping mechanisms such as drugs at an age they should be experiencing a normal, innocent childhood & learning to distinguish right from wrong to try & relieve the unbelievable amount of stress suddenly pushed on them, usually by the people they were supposed to be able to trust.  The above is truly my opinion, I just like to make sure I don't come across TOO ignorant although random internet people's opinions aren't exactly what I live for. I think once in a while it's nice to see both sides of the coin from a single person. Cheers.",0,0,PicaDeGalloChu Jr.,a6O30nJ02PU,0.04146931499872676,2020-02-15 12:13:56,False,True

I couldn't click with the characters which made this feel like a movie I was being forced to watch but did not want. So I just left the theatre.

IT seems to me that   according to movie, there are privileged people able and entitled to any kind of crime, and those who are not lucky to be privileged, who suffer and are the real victims but since they are somehow guilty of being on this world and being born, they deserve it. This movie makes me want to puke. It glorifies reckless, selfish, cruel, irrisponsible, even evil people unable to feel remorse,  presenting them as heroes, as normality, as people that dont deserve punishment, are entitled to happiness, are winners, even if they cheat, destroy, are reckless, they are ok, they just have to be kind to themselves and forget it. I cannot believe thateven in the movies bad people get away with it. On the other hand real  victims are portrayed as idiots full of hate that not only deserve justice but they are the bad ones deserving death. What is next? Classmates killing some ""not cool"" kids and being celebrated as winners andheroes? How many young people will see this movie and continue with their crimes? An how many will justifie it? Ok let be! Just do not forget that your child might commit suicide because  it was bullued while the adults watch and dont give a shit. If the message of this movie is ok, than every and everybodies crime is ok. Thanks for that. If the cruel girl is allowed to be like that than everybody is! And those victimized  dont desrbe justice. And nobody should sit in jail.Somebody skille d should write a few lines about the movie. Justice is not for everybody nor the right to live.
