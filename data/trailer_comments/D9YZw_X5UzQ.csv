There's not going to be much unraveling or excitement here because  I already know what's going to happen for the most part.  Some hotshot named Baby does a bunch of dangerous driving missions for dangerous people and while he develops a deep relationship with a waitress he inadvertently gets into trouble he didn't ask for and now his life is on the line and so is his waitress girlfriend but he doesn't know who he can trust anymore so he must now drive himself out of the frying pan and out of the fire with a lot of stunt choreographed action and edgy script delivery.

2017-03-12T15:27:39,"To everyone making the bizarre comparisons to Drive, and assuming this movie will suck:- The only similarity between the two, is that the story is about a getaway driver. Drive, is a neo noir crime film that came out in 2011. Baby Driver, is largely an action comedy film, and is based on the concept Wright had for the music video to Mint Royale's ""Blue Song"", that he directed way back in 2003. So if anything, this proceeds Drive quite a bit. Also, movies about getaway drivers are not wholly uncommon. Just look at Edgar Wright's body of work directing Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. He gets comedy.

I've missed him so much since ""Scott Pilgrim vs.The World"" in 2010, & ""The World's End"" in 2013.  Although I enjoyed 2015's ""Ant-Man"", I would have loved to see his original imagining of the film. It was kinda cruel how Wright was replaced after spending approximately EIGHT YEARS (since 2006) developing the live-action Marvel Ant-Man movie with Joe Cornish. In 2014, Marvel Studios announced that Wright would exit the film due to ""creative differences"". He was summarily replaced by Peyton Reed as director, with Adam McKay & star Paul Rudd re-writing the screenplay. (Although Wright & Cornish still received both screenplay & story credits, with Wright also credited as executive producer.)

2017-03-17T23:06:25,"So to all the people who keep saying this movie is a ripoff of Drive‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not. Edgar Wright himself says he originally thought of the idea almost 22 years ago and even adapted the idea into a 2003 music video for Mint Royale (which is the opening scene of the movie). So let‚Äôs stop all this nonsense about it being a parody or ripoff because that‚Äôs been settled by the man Edgar Wright himself.  Secondly, to all the people who don‚Äôt think Ansel Elgort was a good cast for Baby, Elgort was the first to join soon after Wright announced production on Baby Driver. The rest of the star studded cast joined soon after. Now I‚Äôm the last person to say I‚Äôm an Ansel Elgort fan, but if legend Edgar Wright had the confidence to cast Elgort before anyone else as his lead for Wright‚Äôs first solo writing and directing credit after 22 years, I think that should answer the skepticism people might have about Elgort as Baby. Not to mention all the rave reviews coming from SXSW that talk about how Elgort is the one that steals the show from veteran buffs Spacey, Hamm, and Foxx, which is a pretty hard feat to do give or take a few Academy Awards, Emmys, Golden Globes, etc.  Never stop doing your thing Edgar Wright.

2017-07-13T10:59:31,WOW.  I just watched this move.  Pretty good action and decent story.  But how is it possible to have a movie that is based on music have so much crappy music.  There is 1 decent song amongst the 24+ songs in this film.  Easy - Commodores or Faith No More.  Tiny bit of a Queen song as well so I guess that is 2 decent songs.  The rest are just trashy junk.  Could have been so much better with a decent repertoire.  Where the royalties too much for them?  This is the only thing I can think of that would have led to the low quality chosen.,0,2,VestigialHead,D9YZw_X5UzQ,0.17058823529411765,2017-07-13 10:59:31,False,True

2017-09-26T10:15:36,"I was reluctant to watch Baby Driver because a friend of mine described this as a musical and i run a mile from musicals. Thankfully , although it's rammed pack full of music , it's definitely not a musical in my opinion. This is the story of a getaway driver called Baby who because of tinnitus , lives his life with his headphones in and a constant soundtrack playing . He meets a girl in a diner and he sees it as his chance to get out of the crime game. I can see why my friend thought this was a musical because in places it's choreographed like one but thankfully the music comes from a brilliant soundtrack and not spontaneous singing. I actually think that the music is so good it becomes the star of this film and not the actors. The story is ok , it starts really well but is unable maintain the adrenaline filled first twenty minutes and gets baggier the longer the film goes on.  It's a brave film to make from Edgar Wright and for the most part it works and i'm all for more films with brilliant soundtracks.

2017-11-08T00:11:10,Just saw baby driver and it's definitely one of the best movies of the year. Baby Driver is about a get away driver who dosent like being in a life of crime and once he meets the girl of his dreams he sees a chance to get out. My favorite thing about this movie is just how stylized it is. Every scene is perfectly synchronized with the music that is playing. The pacing is literally perfect the scenes flow like a river. The acting is fantastic especially from Ansel Elgort you really feel like you are inside his characters head. The writing and character design is perfect every character has a distinct personality that you can get behind and understand. I know everyone says this about this movie but the soundtrack is amazing. I can't think of any flaws this movie has.  To summarize Baby Driver is one of if not the best movie of 2017. I would totally recommend this movie to anyone that likes being a human being.  #babydriver #movie #edgarwright #legendary #anselelgort,3,0,Mister Fayz,D9YZw_X5UzQ,0.44705882352941173,2017-11-08 00:11:10,False,False
