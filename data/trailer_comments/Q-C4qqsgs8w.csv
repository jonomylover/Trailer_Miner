Wonder if that ginger bully is supposed to be Skull, if so where is Bulk? and glad they finally have actual armor (Ivan Ooze movie aside), now sparks flying off them can actually make sense. and powers when not in morphing form makes sense as the other civilians in the show never take on any of the creatures that attack, and when ambushed (as we should know it always happens) they need the strength to defend themselves.

I mean, Marvel made a film about a tree, a talking raccoon, not-She-Hulk, a Russian alien, and Chris Prat going to prison and fighting a guy with a magically powered space hammer and it worked!

2016-10-08T17:28:19,Why modernize the rangers you may ask ? Simple : it would not translate well on screen. lets take Rita for example THERES NO WAY ON GODS EARTH i would be intimidated by the tv version of her AT ALL. This version how ever has a presense which is pretty important for a villian and has a scary voice and is willing to kill the rangers straight up not carring at all that they are kids and she said it gets led she has killed rangers before so God knows how old those where and how she killed them. That this might have not been the best tone maybe I Really wanted to see this movie with this tone so I'm pretty Happy but i feel like if they are trying to make it for old school fans it should have a x men first class tone but either way I'm still Happy. When you are making a movie you have to think not only for the fans but for the whole audience.

2016-10-08T18:07:02,Looks like a cheap Nickelodeon Movie. I don't understand how they fuck something up with almost 30 years of live action source material. I don't mind a darker feel but fuck.  1) Never had baseline superpowers without the suits. Special ability for each user maybe but never all super strong and fast bullshit. Kinda the point of the first Ranger movie they lost there powers.   2) The powers are never found on accident. The rangers are always chosen.   3) Pretty sure the black guy is billy I don't care about the race just feel like he because of the racist casting in the 90s. I would rather they honor the original characters how made the series what it is.  4) Suits and effect look awesome I won't lie but when has changing the source material that much ever worked out? Ghostbusters became a satire of all the mygosit and racist hate about itself which was funny but over the movie plot and story sucked.   5) No real power ranger fan (meaning you still have your fan club membership at your mom's house) could be ok with these big fuck ups.,2,10,Brandon Corby,Q-C4qqsgs8w,0.13720484061393154,2016-10-08 18:07:02,True,True

However, they should have been chosen by Zordon. Not just rangers by accident. Also I hope the sequel does the green with evil storyline. There is no way you do a rangers movie without the evil green ranger. I am sure this is the plan but you wanted to build the foundation first. However, I atleast assumed Scorpina and Gold Dar would be involved in this movie. Maybe they are? It just doesnt seem that way from the trailer. I hope the sequel has Rita choosing her evil green ranger and fighting him from there. You cold even plug Gold dar in there as a mini boss like character until Tommy reveals himself. Movie 3 I would assume you could do the green ranger losing his powers, becoming white ranger and facing Lord Zedd.

There are some interesting character elements being explored here - the 5 rangers clearly have a lot more scope for character development... but in going down a darker more mature path the film is abandoning much of the campy colourfulness that was part of the original show's charm.

You saw the Rangers doing homework, working with kids, or raising money for charities.  It made them great roll models for young children to look up to.

CONS - Super Powers without morphing? First biggest fuck up! - I can forgive the black Billy as long as the character remains intelligent. But as for Jason; the original Jason is supposed to be ripped. Like football build. Making him a scrawny little pencil drops confidence in a red ranger leader role for the audience. - Do the actors and actresses themselves have any fighting experience irl? Being able to fight without morphing is also part of the magic too. It's one of the reasons why nearly every other power rangers series afterwards sucked. - Jason romancing Kimberly? WTF!

I was too young to get into the original Mighty Morphin series much, but I caught a few episodes, and really got in once Lost Galaxy rolled around.   I like the potential here, and the twists they're putting on how it's always worked; in that the Rangers get tougher and stronger both in and out of costume, and they're clearly going to be going through a phase of flying by the seat of their pants without guidance from Alpha and Zordon (is Alpha in this? I'm not sure) in fighting bad guys.   Also, just hearing one line from Blunt's Rita, I already like her as a potentially menacing villain. She's absolutely not Rita Classic, but all Rita classic ever did was throw monsters and goons at the Rangers anyway. Rancik (the major villain form Time Force) established more villain cred in the first episode of his series by busting out of custody and straight up murdering the Red Ranger before the episode was even halfway done, and this Rita looks to be in a similar vein of kicking ass herself, which I'm totally down for.",0,0,ISchulz,Q-C4qqsgs8w,0.05978535353535355,2016-10-08 22:32:03,True,True

They were all cool then, they're still cool now but you gotta be real with yourself. You're not the same kid you were back in the 90s. You've changed; we all have. So look, this movie may not turn out to be perfection, it may be trying too hard to appeal to people born in the very late 90s and early 2000s...but it's still Power Rangers, now with a modern twist. I like the darker tone. I like the high school popular vs unpopular kid thing going on in the trailer (following the crowd vs being yourself). It's interesting enough for me. At least it's not an all-female cast! No, I'm not a sexist. I'm getting married in 2 weeks with a beautiful woman who makes more money than me and is, admittedly, smarter than me in almost every way.

2016-10-08T23:45:53,"What many people are failing to ignore that this captures a particular vibe of the Era; The Original Rangers was taken from Ky≈çry≈´ Sentai Zyuranger, which for its time was a drama series from an entirely different culture, and adapted into an American series which reflected popular american culture at the time with a superhero element. This film is no different, it is a re-imagining of the Power Rangers series for a different era, more reflective of dramatic content reflective of the era. As cheesy as the original was, it tried to be serious for people who are not nearly 30 and beyond to be reflective of their own personal issues, and it continued for over 20 years to do so through various forms (and included Death, Relationships, broken families and other situations)... but never retained the Dramatic element that many Sentai series took on.  This is definitely an exciting film on its own merit, and deserves a place between the transition of ""Mighty Morphin' "" and ""Ky≈çry≈´ Sentai Zyuranger""... it will be good to see what form this film takes with a proper trailer and eventually release. I know we all think it looks like Chronicle... but Landis didn't write or direct this (despite having written an original treatment/script for a film based on Rangers) Dean Israelite from Project Almanac fame directed it...

It is a movie though, so not much time to establish everything, but I really do hope it's more than just the generic ""angsty/bullied teen gets super powers"" scenario we've seen so many times in other films.

2016-10-09T00:27:52,I love it and I still watch the series today.  The tones are darker and the students start off in detention but there's no that much difference. they have to use the extra time to develop the characters so i'm glad they weren't just beamed up. This gives way to more clever writing. (Green ranger might be some one who found a coin and decided to do bad and would be in the next movie).  I understand that people don't like the fact that the rangers aren't goody goody two shoes but giving or enabling teenagers with amazing powers during a confusing part of their life and seeing them make the right choice makes them more power ranger than any sugarcoated saturday morning show. adaptations must be made for a idea to stay relevant and to preserve its past.

No I don't but will it be a good power rangers movie eeh I'd have to see it to make that decision.

""Teenagers with attitude"" in the 90s didn't mean teens who hated life and society. It meant teens who knew what they wanted and worked to accomplish it. If anything, they were the popular kids. They did after-school activities and were team leaders for the other students. These were people for others to strive to be like. Ideals.

They are average normal humans with exceptional fighting abilities before they were given the Ranger uniforms. Upon morphing, their outfits give them that supernatural strength. Come on Saban really?! *Edit to add the following* I know that carbon copying the original 90's series wouldn't work due to obvious reasons like the era it started. I loved everything about this trailer up until RJ Cylar's character mentions about the strength difference he noticed lately. Before showing that off.

2016-10-09T09:56:11,"I'm not terribly fussed about certain things changing, somethings I find in poor taste but I can set aside. Its not like the original series in whatever spotlight you see it in, is going to change. As a fan myself when I saw the first Transformers movie live action I knew it was only a matter of time, and I just wanted to see it. I wanted a version that grew up with the people who enjoyed the original series. Whether a reboot, or a sort of continuation of MMPR.  Understanding the difficulties of show business I expect that not EVERYTHING I want from this is going to happen. I don't expect to see  Angel grove as the peaceful place it was in the series. I don't expect to see characters 100% likeness to the original characters  What I DO expect is the series respects the legacy its based on. I do expect that the characters at least for who they are are similar enough. I do expect a story line improved but not completely changed. I do NOT have my hopes up for seeing Tommy appearing in THIS film, as much as I would love that. They're going to want to develope the original five first so if he did appear in this film it'd be at the end, and that'd just piss everyone off I think, because lets face it Tommy deserves a lot of screen time.  There are some things I really reaaaaallly hope doesn't happen.  Don't go ghostbusters gender swap like Tommy, not because I hate girls or anything but  nostalgia is what's going to sell this for you, don't shit on it for those who're fans of the character by scribbling over it with a made up character to try and sell to women. There's already females in the story you can use for that.  Don't give shit low screen time for the rangers in suit, everyone's going to expect that the suit action gets enough screen time.  and above all remember that fans will be watching this has obviously got at LEAST trilogy potential but if it fails now  my own and the hopes of others who also wished to see this will porbably go down with it. Lion's gate's made some great films and I'm glad the film's getting the attention it deserves, now bring the fans the film they deserve. :)",0,0,Joshua Owens,Q-C4qqsgs8w,0.11338091338091341,2016-10-09 09:56:11,True,True

They totaly missed the point of Power Rangers, the message they're trying to get across is actually the EXACT OPPOSITE of the original show one.  The original show was about getting stronger by yourself, when something bad happenned, they didn't blame anyone for it, instead they grew stronger and managed to deal with it by themselves.  This teaser show the new movie's message ""it's not your fault, it's society fault, you don't have to change, you don't need to get stronger, it's others peoples faults so it's not your responsability, you don't have to do anything, do nothing, things will still works out anyway"".   It's the exact opposite of what Power rangers stood for, instead of telling peoples to get stronger, they tell them to just wait and take it, instead of telling peoples they can change, they tell them they don't have to, instead of telling peoples to get stronger by themselves, they tell them it's okay to be weak and things will still works out.    I'm not saying the original show was perfect, or even good, especially since it was made to sell toys, but at least the message was good, and somes peoples grew up with it, and learned from it.

It was so human, and that made all martial-art fights so great. Really sad about that one.  But I'm still excited for this movie, and I can't wait to see it.

Look at Tony Stark, the MCUs beloved sarcastic character of comic relief. In the comics he was not as sarcastic as RDJ portrays him on the big screen, he is actually kinda of an arrogant asshole in the comics who had a substance abuse for an arc.

VR Troopers. Big Bad Beetle Borgs. I loved the action. I stopped watching, for some reason, just before the sequel and haven't been back. Never hated it. Never ragged on it for being stupid. Just grew out of it but never lost my love of it. I do see the tone as more serious in this like..there are actual characters and people with issues. I don't see Emo Teens who are just sad and pathetic. This honestly reminds me a lot of the Alternative school I went to. Some criminals, some just not cutting it in standard education. The rejected. Let me tell you, we had our issues but we didn't lose heart or humor. I truly see that in this. Could it still suck? Yes. Absolutely.

I will copy and paste what I have said on other sites in my attempt to awaken humanity. Please share this and join me in awaking humanity. The more we awaken the brighter our future will be as one. Whoever is reading this, please meditate briefly before you continue to read. I will try to make this brief as well. This is the 3rd dimension. We are quarantined from the rest of the universe in order to enjoy and embrace our experiences on earth without interference and interruption to our evolutionary path. Just like we have a system of government here, there is a system of a type of government up in the heavens as you may call it. As above, so below. Everything has free will. I don't speak of free will as in do I eat this chocolate bar or should I eat this apple. I speak of, do I seek to serve myself in this life or do I seek to serve others. That is the question everyone must ask themselves. There are different rules to free will, it all depends on the demension. Yes this is a multidimensional universe. There are no separations. What I am getting at is, this planet is quarantined from the universe but because of free will there are random and difficult windows that form at random times, that allow anything out in space to pertrude our quarantine to fulfill the law of free will. I speak of what you may call UFOs. UFOs are only an iota part of the grand picture. The government/elite are opening various windows through there CERN and HAARP projects. I am not sure why. This may affect our evolutionary path however. I hope for the better but too many human beings are asleep to understand what is going on. Many will repeat the 3rd dimension. We must change, we must serve others. This is the ideal time to change. Become one with people, I mean everyone. That means have kids, enjoy your family, enjoy life, but also help as many people along the way. Give back to the world literally and figuratively. We are all one, this is the law of one. I hope this may remove some of your blind folds. If you would like more information on this matter, send me a message and we will talk.

2016-10-09T19:38:04,"Here's my honest opinion. It's a teaser so I won't judge too harshly, but this doesn't look anything like the Power Rangers. It honestly comes across as one of those ""kiddy"" franchises that are desperate to justify their existence to a larger audience. So what we get is a generic dark toned trailer with mopey music and dialogue that's trying to hard to be serious. Power Rangers was an incredibly goofy action show aimed at children. It had cheesy moments that worked with its bright and colorful settings. The fights were over the top, and the show is absolutely hilarious to watch as an adult. Now, does this teaser look anything like that? Not really.... Look, I'm not saying that SOME ""kiddy"" franchises can't appeal to a larger audience, but turning something like Power Rangers into..... This, will probably make it lose what made it enjoyable to watch to begin with. Some products should stay in their respected group they are marketed to ( I mean seriously, remember what happened when Sonic, Superman, Spider-Man, and TMNT and Transformers tried to shift into something they wenrnt?

And i am so fuckingg excited. This is gonna be way better than all the other remakes out there for sure. I bet this is gonna be super successful. And I feel like it has adult and kid appeal.

2016-10-09T20:12:56,"Power Rangers were about a group that WERE outcasts, but were a team and started to train and be something for themselves. The suits mainly just boosted their abilities, but they knew how to fight before hand. Here they took a page from the Toby Spiderman movies and Meteor Man where they touched something (which I'm guessing might me some meteor or some shit) then they start to get powers and use them and see how they are and blah blah blah.  Which goes to me asking... what the fuck is the point of the suits then? And why does it seem like they're worthless before they touched the wall of Super Mario Bros. The Movie?  Not saying this looks like shit. It just looks a bit way too changed and seems more like it's aiming to literally just be a marvel copycat with the skin/name of Power Rangers placed onto it.  It's not shitty, but it sure don't look good at all either. Not sure what I think about this. I just know that from what I saw, I sure would not watch this as it doesn't look like it was made to appeal to me like the older Power Ranger stuff.

2016-10-09T22:16:10,"Look, as someone who watched Power Rangers as a kid, I have mixed feelings about this. I like the idea of a more grounded Power Rangers story, and I think the suits look pretty cool, but I also wish they'd cut down on the teenage angst and turn up the brightness a little. I'm willing to wait for more trailers and the final product, and I'm excited to see where it goes.  But it's just a movie. There's no point treating it as if your entire life hangs in the balance. If the movie's good, that's great. It's about time someone other than Marvel got a live-action reboot right. If the movie sucks, then you still have years of precious childhood memories, and a pretty good comic book series that's currently out.  But there's no point in attacking everyone else on the internet just because they agree with you. If someone doesn't think it looks like their Power Rangers, that's a perfectly valid opinion. If someone is excited for the film, I'm betting there's not much you can do to change their mind. Stop treating these films like they're something serious.

For instance one of them was Wild Force, a power Rangers show also know as Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger. So back on track, they would take the scenes and edit them while placing  American Subtitles, Cast, Translation, anything that would make it more American. That's where all the bad acting comes from. In the actual Power Rangers, They make it somewhat more dark like being sent to hell, Getting hardcore killed, and even giving souls. As dark as that stuff is, it is still meant as a kid show because of the effort and events that takes place in the show. I mean  this year, 2016, is Power Rangers 4oth anniversary. It's called Dobutsu Sentai Zhuhyger (Something like that) That has a special ranger that is almost always mentally depressed. No Joke.

Billy is now black and not white. Trini is now Hispanic not Asian . Why do they have powers? The power stones were made by aliens. The power coins adapt to them like a host. Whatever power that stones have they now possess. The suits are basically symbiotes. Which is why when Jason was morphing it was just leeching onto him. It's already apart of his body.

2016-10-10T06:46:58,"Ok, time to set the record straight with the insensible complaints so-called 'fans' are having. It's a teaser which means it TEASES and makes you garner some interest to give the movie a chance. What? Do you want another Batman v Superman trailer that shows EVERYTHING? Like Wonder Woman and Doomsday? Seriously?   Just because a film takes a slightly darker, more suspenseful and mysterious approach doesn't categorize it as 'gritty' or 'edgy'. This isn't The Crow. The team behind this understands that we fans have grown up with Power Rangers and like (some of) us, we've matured, so no reason that a modernized Ranger film shouldn't cater to our older mindset. The premise of the original show was 'teenagers with attitude'. Remember being a kid and hormonal and mischief and harassed by peers? Did you expect this to be some cookie cutter crud? This is possibly the most honest depiction of life as a teenager. If anything, this film, while it does have it's more foreboding tone (Power Rangers IS a sci-fi oriented show, go fig), the humor and lightheartedness is undeniably apparent.  If you know anything about Power Rangers, it was a rip-off (yet respectable Americanized version) of Sentai and in some if not all of those seasons, the heroes have been depicted exhibiting special abilities outside of their morph. Whether it was intentional or not on the writers' & director's part, this seems to be a nod to that part of the Japanese mythos and don't you think it would make sense that after a human is exposed to some intergalactic energies (morphing) that their physiology would be affected. Again, whether this was accidental or not, watch Day of the Dumpster and the episodes proceeding that. First episode the team, pre-morph had great difficulty fighting Putties but in later fights (still pre-morph), they could handle them no sweat.  Quit trying to shove white guilt down our throats. If you want to complain about whitewashing, you wouldn't have watched Power Rangers which totally race changed the ORIGINAL all Japanese Sentai cast.  I'm not saying this movie is going to be perfect. As cool as the suits look in released photos, I still have my reservations about their design--seems to imitate Iron Man too much, but I get it. Power Rangers should look like POWER Rangers and have some cosmic armor to battle monstrous enemies. Overall, I think this is going to do well and as a long time hardcore Ranger fan, I hope it does despite my reservations about certain creative decisions here. If you think you can make a better movie, go for it. I wish you the best as a fellow fan to see what great artistry you accomplish.",0,0,plu5h,Q-C4qqsgs8w,0.20567169957413858,2016-10-10 06:46:58,True,True

Really, if they keep it simple it can live up to its potential; five ill-behaved teens learn value of life when they're tasked with defending their home against a seemingly insurmountable enemy. And as the centerpiece, after multiple attempts the Megazord only forms once the Rangers finally come together as a true team. It can be great, but it's up to a partially dubious production crew to make it so.",0,0,Rodan Hibiki,Q-C4qqsgs8w,0.1411845730027548,2016-10-10 08:25:47,True,True

2016-10-10T08:49:34,"here's what i think the movie's going to be like.  My guess is that the first 10 to 15 min are going to be character introduction  then the meteor hits they go to that thing for 10 15 min then there  will be 10 15 min of discovering changes with a possible training  montage which will take 2 to 5 min arrival at cave taking 5 to 10 min of  sight seeing then 5 to 10 min of zordon explaining who he is. following  this we will hopefully get the first monster attack with a classic one  we know of or they might go the original route and just have a  completely original monster leading the puttys in battle with the human  army (mainly US.) following this we have the rangers fight then lose  their first battle but they learn some things about the monster and that  they have to fight together. this should take about 30 to 45 min Following  we have rita mentally attack the rangers at night trying to break their  spirit before the final epic battle that will clock in around 45 min  total with side stuff happening with other characters like Jason's dad  and the bullies trying to get a video on youtube or something along  those lines. This final battle will have the introduction of the zords  and this will take up 2/3s or 3/4s of the entire battle time. then when  the monster is destroyed the puttys retreat or are destroyed in the  ensuing blast and the rangers are declared heroes by the city. The  last 5 to 10 min will be Jason and Kimberly making their relationship  open to the school and the team having a better out look in their  personal lives but they are told by zordon that the threat is far from  over then we get a final scene where rita holds the green coin and says  somthing along the lines of ""now who do I choose to be my ranger?""  end movie.  What  do you guys think is this a possible outcome of what the movie might be  since it will probably clock in around 112min to 170 min total.",0,0,Valrock Mograth,Q-C4qqsgs8w,0.07191358024691358,2016-10-10 08:49:34,True,True

I've been following it since the day it was announced, to the Ranger cast announcements, Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa, Bryan Cranston as Zordon, and just recently Bill Hader is Alpha 5!  First of all... WHAT!?  What a cast for this movie!!!   Each announcement was like ""Im worried who it will be..... OMG PERFECT!!!!!!!!!""   And we haven't even seen the full transformations, Alpha, Zordon, the ZORDS, the freaking MEGAZORD.   This is such a teaser, and it's such an incredible teaser, that it gave me goosebumps, and yes, TEARS.  It's everything a re-imagined reboot could be for me.  There is no ""MY CHILDHOOD!! :("" here.  I am OPEN and excited for these huge blockbuster movie reboots, and this looks like it's going to be the best yet!!!  I remember thinking about 7 years ago, ""There's no way that will ever happen.""  But here we stand today, teaser trailer and all......  This movie is seriously going to be epic!  They are trying to start a new Hunger Games/Twilight/Divergent series (nothing will ever compete with Harry Potter....) AND it would be a franchise started from a 23 year old tv show for children..  to sell toys to said children..) and I think they might have just done it.  The response has been phenomenal thus far.  Yes, the Jason/Kimberly kiss is off, but they are definitely stirring the pot for the inevitable Jason/Kimberly/Tommy love triangle story that will happen in the sequel, if not, movie 3 (ala, Twilight/Hunger Games/Divergent.. lol).  I live where it was filmed too.  So in the trailer where they show the Angel Grove town sign, I've sat on that bench beside it....  I could see how they would want this little fishing part of our City, as Angel Grove.  I can't wait until March 24!

That's never been what Power Rangers has been about, nor what it should be! 2) If the Rangers become super-powered beings just by simply holding the Power Coins, it kinda defeats the purpose of having Ranger suits or the ""never escalate a battle unless the situation calls for it"" rule that has been a key part of the franchise! 3) Jason x Kimberley =¬†NOPE!!! Not only does this feel extremely forced, but¬†you people have just written yourself into a corner if you wanted to do a sequel with Tommy in it! 4)¬†There's a complete lack of a money shot of the five all suited-up, which¬†not only¬†prevents the audience from being hyped, but it¬†also¬†makes me think that you're not even proud of the ugly-ass suit designs and that seeing them in motion would be even worse!",10,15,Otaking Mikohani,Q-C4qqsgs8w,-0.08020833333333333,2016-10-10 19:55:17,True,True

2016-10-11T12:15:04,Some of you guys are just too blinded by Nostalgia. Why can't Power Rangers evolve with the time period it is in now? It's called a reboot for a reason. Some things are gonna change for a reason. Just because the tone is changed doesn't mean it's gonna be garbage . Batman was camp for years and turned darker over time. But people still love him no matter what. If you think this is dark then you must not have seen enough darker movies/shows. This is child's play compared to the fan film. So it really could've been something trying too hard to be dark for audiences.Ôªø,37,5,Mistah K,Q-C4qqsgs8w,-0.029166666666666667,2016-10-11 12:15:04,True,True

2016-10-11T18:00:10,"I grew up in the 90's with the original Power Rangers tv series. Seeing so many changes being made to the story with this film feels quite disapointing for a long time fan. They changed the characters, fortunately kept their names. They changed the suits, changed their origins stories how they became the Rangers, they changed the color/theme of how the Power Rangers should be filmed. They were always full in sunlight so that are all quite disapointing changes, and of course the villain, yet they failed to give her the right look and making her scary. I always was very scared of Rita Repulsa as a kid, but this new version isnt a scary villain. But it's reboot, and this is exactly what a reboot is. On the other hand is a very good thing that the stories of the Power Rangers keep being alive, and this is how. So I hope this new version of Power Rangers will be popular and gets a fanbase, and if it's a good film i'll be satisfied, but it will always be unfortunate that there are so many changes.",0,0,Lord Mistery,Q-C4qqsgs8w,0.1794495980210266,2016-10-11 18:00:10,True,True

Billy is now black and not white. Trini is now Hispanic not Asian . Why do they have powers? The power stones were made by aliens. The power coins adapt to them like a host. Whatever power that stones have they now possess. The suits are basically symbiotes. Which is why when Jason was morphing it was just leeching onto him. It's already apart of his body.

2016-10-13T08:02:00,"makes me go ""HMMMMMM"". I feel like they missed the point and the mark with everything except Rita. They took out the unique aspects. Reminds me of The Phantom movie. It should have been that Jason was someone who had done like WMA(weapons), Karate, Judo, and Kung fu, and he was into an MA philosophy. And Billy is getting picked on, that's okay. Maybe have kimberly be picked on too(or an abusive father or parent, having girls being mean doesn't mean anything). Then have the adam be someone who could lie to people and start off a bit of a con man or bully but start to be swayed by Jason. And they still get picked by Zordon instead of ripping off 'Chronicle"".  ""this is when they learn"" to be heroes/Rangers/Soldiers. And Zordon wanted good people who weren't already associated with other groups ect and they'd be around 17. And maybe they did something to stand out after already becoming friends like try to help people around where Zordon crashed. Maybe Jason doesn't see himself as a teacher but he's helping them learn, and they ask if he's going to say he doesn't see himself as a leader either(and he has to accept that). I mean Power rangers is that type of show. They just needed to make it believable and have good action.   Maybe this will work in its own way as ""the breakfast club"" ""chronicles"". Seems it has X-men, and generic superhero adventure in there too.    The problem isn't a lack of spandex. It's about what they put in and left out. And whether it's from PR or just using the likeness to tell a generic story.   Not saying it's awful though. I don't know.

Once again teenagers are being played by people who are clearly in their early 20s. +1  2. 0:08 - 0:10 If it is, your dad's keeping it in the wrong part of the house, seeing as how you won't be driving anything anywhere any time soon. +1  3. 0:14 - 0:18 Angel Grove is the PG-13 version of Harlem if it was a white community. +1  4. 0:19 Is that supposed to be a classroom? As spacious as it is, there's not enough room for everyone, even with two people per table. The area kids are supposed to be ""weirdos and criminals"" which means pretty much the whole school should be there, even on a Saturday. This room should be crowded with tables with barely enough room to maneuver and the shot filled with more teenagers. +1  5. 0:28 School can afford seal stickers, but only for one locker. +1  Also, anyone who can take the time to scrape ""bitch"" onto a locker door twice has enough time to get caught in the act, so the school should already know who has been defacing the locker. +1  Also still, tornado isn't an insult. +1  Also still again, person clearly invested in another person's death lies about no one caring about said person's death. +1  Also still  yet again, I suppose Sez is the culprit. Why else would that otherwise meaningless arrangement of letters be on that door? +1  6. 0:29 - 0:34 You mean the locker room? Where you're supposed to be before practice? How do you not already know what's going on with her and how long did it take you to figure it out? +1  7. 0:36 - 0:38 Character must have a forced physical change to parallel their emotional change clich√©. +1  Also, girl cutting her hair shorter by herself equals empowerment clich√©. +1  8. 0:43 - 0:45 It's impossible to be ignorant of that fact _before_ entering a restricted area. +1  Also, restricted area has no security measures to prevent anyone from entering. +1  9. 0:46 - 0:47 Did anyone bring any tools with them to chip away at the rocks to get what's embedded in them? I'll bet not! +1  10. 0:49 - 0:52 Oh shit! They brought explosives! Well, so much for getting what was inside now. +1  11. 0:54 You can tell me the morpher survived the blast because it's alien technology, which I will gladly accept, but the not-yet Power Ranger who blew up the wall didn't know that beforehand. +1  12. 0:58 - 1:01 And yet you hung around anyway. +1  Also, what's with the sirens? Restricted areas are government sanctioned. If the police _do_ show up, it won't be until much later after the FBI shows up, and they don't use sirens. +1  13. 1:04 ...that we will now shit upon with CGI instead of practical props and sets. +1  14. 1:07 Why is the faucet running? He's not shaving or brushing his teeth. Not-yet Power Ranger is a dick to running water. +1  15. 1:07 - 1:09 In the show, they only had their powers when they were morphed. This movie is turning the table on that, saying that they have their powers at all times (or at least while in the vicinity of the morphers). This means that a period of adjustment is necessary in order to adapt to their new abilities, so a lot more than just that sink corner was destroyed, right? I mean, he fell the house and is now homeless, correct? +1  16. 1:09 - 1:10 Don't you already know? Didn't you get your morpher at the same time they did? You were all together in the restricted area, after all. +1  17. 1:11 - 1:12 The director was either bullied or a bully as a kid, since he knows that the correct way to deliver a headbutt is to the nose, not the forehead. Bullies, take note! +1  18. 1:12 - 1:13 I see this actor went to the Shia Labeouf School for Acting. +1  19. 1:14 - 1:15 ""Damn, dude!"" is right! If you headbutt someone _that_ hard, I'm pretty sure that would be considered attempted murder. +1  20. 1:15 - 1:18 Morphers are dicks to food. +1  21. 1:18 - 1:19 Do you mean the restricted area that you were chased out of? Why not? I'm sure security wasn't beefed up at all. +1  22. 1:24 - 1:27 Obviously it is. +1  23. 1:42 There is no reason for them to be taking up defensive stances as there is clearly no one in the cavern with them. +1  24. 1:44 Boxcar Willie. +1  25. 1:54 - 1:57 If Angel Grove is white Harlem, then she keeps a gun under her pillow, right? Pretty ballsy of the advertising agency to put the final shot of the movie into the teaser trailer!  1:57 - 1:59 Well damn! +1  Also, why was Rita pretending to caress whoever that was? Is she gay or is it just cock teasing to get horny teenagers into the theaters? +1  26.

But what I see from the 2017 film trailer: it ain't gonna be of an action type with unmorphed fights of some real martial artists - just some teenage melodrama (basically never been a fan of robots, spandex, love stories or the Pink girl, it's only actors doing stunts 's always been the reason for my watching MMPR) - got much disappointed.   Then originally Jason was so cool, strong & leading I just can't take this new billish variant.... & generally I'm not happy with the whole not athletic cast that even glad there's no Tommy - better not to see him at all than to get another 20+ year old teenager with behavior problems...

2016-10-22T23:13:40,I'm a fan of the original MMPR I've always said the Rangers would do better with a darker tone and more adult material. This is looking like what I've been waiting for.  Look forward to the next trailer and hope they don't reveal everything and keep somethings hidden...namely Zords and maybe Zordon. If they do show them or anything it should be very brief and hard to catch.

2016-11-07T15:48:38,Everyone needs to remember some things: 1. Probably about 85% of this trailer will take place in the first 45min-1hr of this movie and this will be probably about a 2 hour movie at least 2. This movie has a budget of about $150 million which is about as much as the first transformers movie in terms of what they can go for as far as special effects and etc. and I don't think we even saw a fifth of that in this trailer  Don't judge a movie by its first trailer,1,0,chase depperschmidt,Q-C4qqsgs8w,0.15816326530612246,2016-11-07 15:48:38,True,True

2016-11-08T02:00:25,I'm just hoping for the most part that this is an actual intro movie that we can appreciate how this generation of rangers came to be. Not like the Lord Zedd Ranger movie in the 00's where it was just a 2-hour long episode of what was in the series already. Maybe give an in depth look to at least one or two of the rangers. Like what was Jason's screw up? Why did his dad say that Angel Grove High Students are lumatics and criminals? I mean this could be the start of something great. Maybe a trilogy or something but I'm just hoping this doesn't into another 2-hour episode of the original power rangers.,1,0,Alfred Fonacier III,Q-C4qqsgs8w,0.1465625,2016-11-08 02:00:25,True,True

No. This movie is about kids finding objects that give them superpowers. That's it. Then someone will lead them to Zordon and Alpha (the little ninja dude probably) who will tell them the purpose of their powers and at the last minute they'll defeat the villain. It's going to feel forced and fake. There's not even going to be a moment where the rangers say, I don't want to do this, because they're just going to willingly do it without hesitation. There's not enough time in a movie for them to say no because there's all this other drama, bullshit, and high school problems that they wanted to make sure to get in there. The film should have started out with a badass villain, creating a need for the rangers, and then the kids finding the coins just in time and them saying, yeah we can defeat this thing now but we need courage, and then the film building them up until they finally get the courage, but that's not what this story is. There's no need for the rangers, they just randomly become them and THEN the need for them is created when zordon finds them. That's why it's going to feel so fake and that's why this movie is going to bomb.  Here is the first thirty minutes of the film: the rangers will meet in detention, ditch it, and go wandering around that rock formation place were they'll find the coins and discover they have superpowers. That car chase in the trailer? That's just them running from ""security"" after they use the explosive to get the coins. The second quarter of the film (the next thirty minutes) will be about them discovering their powers and all that they can do with them and getting into trouble and whatnot. Then someone will find out about them and their powers because the coins are missing and these kids now have superpowers and the little ninja dude or someone will find them and lead them to zordon and alpha because how else are the rangers going to find them if not be lead to them? The third quarter will be about finding zordon and alpha and being talked into being superheroes. The last quarter will be them defeating the last minute villain, which will feel forced and fake. That water scene? That's them just discovering more about their powers. Rita on top of Trini? I bet that's just a dream. If Rita wanted to kill the rangers, why wouldn't she just kill trini when she was on top of her? That's why it's a dream sequence, a nightmare given to her by the power of the coin.

Yes, this is taking itself more seriously than the show, but the show was cheesy as hell. This isn't Dark Knight level serious. Could've been much more darker.   2. The characters actually seem to have actual attitude. Clears up Zordon's request; the original team were basically idealistic boy scouts. I like that the team are troubled teenagers.   3. They made the suits look cool. As much as I feel nostalgic towards the classic suits, the spandex and helmet look wouldn't work with this tone and the movie suits are starting to look cheesy as well, so the armor look is a nice alternative, considering what they had to work with.   4. Rita is actually intimidating!   5. The cast seem to actually care about the project. Based on the Comic Con panel, they like the franchise, want it to succeed and clearly had fun filming.

This trailer sets expectations opposite to what a power rangers movie should be.  Power rangers was just fun and creative. It never needed to be more than that.  It's just a sad reminder we live in a world that takes its' entertainment too seriously. I really doubt I'm going to see a T-rex do a tail bounce into a giant green mans face...   Power rangers is the defintion of campy. This trailer doesn't have a drop of camp in it. They should have left the brand alone and made something original.

I know it's called bullying, but the bullying we see in movies, don't always make sense. calling a beautiful young lady¬†""ugly""¬†is weird. Really, Those kind of movies are known for¬†hiring attractive actors. The other girl¬†cuts her hair to go from beautiful, to... beautiful? OMG, those jumps¬†look hilariously bad.  If anything is going to doom this movie, it's effort to be edgy.  I criticized it a lot. I hope it's actually good when it comes out. It's just that this teaser gave a bad first impression  P.S.

2017-04-25T06:24:13,"REVIEW, NO SPOILERS.  This movie was good at first, it wasn't as cliche as I thought it would be at the start.  I mean, sure, you kinda have your cliche school children 'group', but that's what the original power rangers was like.   Aside from the start - it became almost too predictable, oh, this is about to happen? Well, I know what'll happen next. It was literally like that, it was comedy more than anything. You're also dealing with too much cheesy story line, sure, the actors were okay with this type of movie but the story line was the huge problem.  It was like watching Dora asking you where the most obvious thing is, yeah, it's that painful.   I do believe they aimed this at the wrong audience, felt like for kids, but not for kids(?) I don't know what that's all about, the ""Billy"" of the group fitted in perfectly, and he was probably my favourite character of them all, because he fit in his role well and he did a good job with it.  I'd give this movie a 4/10 and that's at a stretch, I would've gotten my money back if I could, obviously point of views are a thing w/ opinions, so don't take my word for it, look at other reviews and check out some clips to note your decision down compared to mine.

2018-05-28T13:24:47,"To all them people moaning like little kids bashing on it for it's dark tone and maturity, just do one and appreciate this movie. It reflects what teenagers are going through and is relatable (as it dives into important and relevant topics such LQBTQ characters, nudes being sent around/cyber-bullying, autistic characters etc, and this helps audiences see themselves in these characters and this is just some of the things that make this movie ground-breaking) so audiences can have a deeper connection with the characters and I love the fact that is a character-driven movie and is a teen movie first and a superhero movie second. All them who cry and complain about this movie should fix up because if they want cheesy and campy versions of Power Rangers (which is fine) then they can watch the influx and dozens and dozens of tv shows that have that tone, instead of being greedy and selfish, let new fans come in and enjoy it and embrace the change, and I personally love the fact that the 2017 movie has a mature tone with edginess and pushes boundaries whilst still maintaining the sense of fun but also realism too and it's sad that many people underrate this movie. The cast and crew (and especially the music composer and director) did a great job on the movie and I just sincerely thank them for bringing Power Rangers in for the new generation and trying to attract more mature audiences. Take it from a guy like me, I'm 19 and I basically wrote a whole SA showing support for this movieüòÇand I use to despise the Power Rangers from Tv (I still do). I watched and loved them as a kid but as I got older, the cheesiness and campiness put me off but then the movie came out in 2017 and it was huge surprise to me and I was taken aback and pleasantly shocked that they dived into serious themes, relevant topics and they also gave positive messages but that doesn't mean that fans who enjoy the campiness can't enjoy Power Rangers because as I said before, this movie is for new fans and older audiences, if they want to watch Power Rangers closer to the boring old source material, then they have the 2 Power Rangers movies made in the 1990s and the 12+ tv shows that is has. Ignore the haters, because this movie still got loyal fans and hopefully the cast and crew can keep on rolling with what they're doing so well.",0,0,The Boss,Q-C4qqsgs8w,0.12348484848484856,2018-05-28 13:24:47,False,False
