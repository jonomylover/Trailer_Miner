The piano man himself, Billy Joel. Seriously, I think it's time he got recognition.  The biopic would chronicle his early life and childhood, showing his early struggles (cold spring harbor, suicide attempt, etc.) and would lead into the creation of some of his most famous albums being created, like Piano Man, The Stranger, or 52nd Street, and show his personal life and struggles that led him to create storm front or river of dreams.

2019-03-04T22:18:33,"Here's something I noticed in this trailer. There are a few moments which are straight from real documented parts of Elton's life, like the music video to ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" at 0:59 and his wedding to Renate Blauel at 1:51. In these scenes, little details are off, like Elton's suit patterns, Kiki's dungarees, and Renate's dress color. I feel like this is supposed to be part of the ""fantasy"" element of the film. It's not a frame-for-frame recreation, but rather Elton's life filtered through his own vision.    If the film has any nuance like that, I'm going to love it! As many people have already pointed out, music biopics are very formulaic, to the point of parody. I'm glad this movie is going to have an R-rating so it can be an authentic view of his life, and I'm glad Taron is singing.

Let's make movies about David Bowie or John Lennon and the Beatles, to make their legacies live on forever, but I honestly think that there's still time to make a film about Elton John.

On the big screen Because they managed to stay grounded with all the fame at an early age plus continued to have success after 50 years.!! And have always been great role models. Can't wait for Rocketman, David Bowie would be great. What about JOURNEY movie that is when Steve Perry was with group. Billy Joel movie as well. These are just some of the greats that have lasted over 50 years that is amazing in this industry. A Ronnie Milsap movie would be really great as well.! The Stevie Wonder of Country music. But mixes soul pop ect in his music plays the piano. Then can sing a good traditional country song so easy what a great he is. This groups and solo artists deserve to be given an honorary  Grammy for all they have done.

Unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, they don't try to cover up the low points of Elton's life. It being a musical also helps to let us hear more of the songs. The songs also usually had to do with the plot and weren't thrown in willy nilly, which was nice. Bernie Taupin also gets his fair share of credit. My dad, who had seen Elton John on his first American tour, really enjoyed it as well. Highly recommend.   Also, can people shut up about the gay sex scene? It's 15 seconds and there's zero nudity. You forget it happened 5 minutes later. Clam down.",2,1,Aug,S3vO8E2e6G0,0.29506172839506173,2019-05-19 05:39:06,True,True

It was too distracting for me.  The song/dance breaks felt like an excuse rather than a natural extension of the scene.  To me, 'La La Land' is the perfect mold for how a musical should be done.  The singing and dancing was used sparingly and only when the scene absolutely demanded it.  Anyway, I personally felt that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was a better film.

With Rocketman I expected more concert scenes, less of the little boy crap ( who ever has a perfect childhood?

2019-06-08T21:24:33,"I would very much like Hollywood to do a biopic on Jared Fogle, the former Subway spokesperson and now convicted felon,  roly-poly-boy-toy and daily punching bag for any number of his fellow inmates at the federal penitentiary in Englewood, Colorado.   Perhaps it too could  be a musical.  One of the numbers could be called ""Smaller Pants,"" and two different versions could both open and close the production.  In the beginning, Jared sings ""I wanna get in smaller pants,"" in reference to his desire to lose weight by eating only veggie subs.  At the end prior to his arrest, as he's flying around the country molesting children, he could sing the same line, but it would of course have a far more sinister meaning.   Another number could involve a couple of parents going to the authorities to report that their pre-adolescent son has been victimized by Fogle.  The song could be titled ""He Went to Jared.""   You see, I'm a dead ringer for Fogle.   We're talking ""separated at birth"" identical.   Up until November, 2015 I had a fairly steady part time gig posing as him and entertaining at kids' birthday parties.  For a reasonable fee, I'd provide the entertainment (balloon animals and showing the kids the former pants with a 48 inch waistline that ""Jared"" used to have to wear before he started eating Subway veggies subs everyday) and the food (a Subway platter). Needless to say, my tax returns for the past few years have shown a fairly significant reduction in income. My last gig was just after Thanksgiving in 2015. The people who had booked me had paid a deposit in advance, so they went ahead and had me come out with my balloons and five foot cold cut with six toppings on  Italian herb bread.  I ended up getting mauled by their German Shepherd who had been watching CNN a week or so earlier.

2019-06-13T15:45:45,"Be warned: This is a homosexual musical, wrapped beautifully in poetic cinematic genius.  It sadly contains both heterosexual and homosexual soft porn scenes* (that make me once again long for  the 40s and 50s cinematic sensibilities of modesty and nuance). It is unabashedly pro-gay in its overtones.   That being said, it does a helluva job showing the painful family dynamics that drive children to seek love and acceptance in others the rest of their lives, and, all too commonly, in the addictions that are an attempt to fill the hole in their hearts.  It is a gritty, hard-hitting look at the human struggle for meaning and acceptance of anyone who has been abused in childhood.  It is an unflinching examination of the brutal consequences of our poor choices in our search for real love and the denial we bury ourselves in along the way as we cope with the  betrayal of those we should be able to trust.    With a world that has consistently grown more selfish, many,  many people will be able to see themselves (their pain and struggle) in this movie. My prayer is they will also do the hard work neccesary to confront their demons, stop running from their pain and the truths of their lives,  and own their self-destructive choices so as to be able stop the abuse cycle and to find, give and receive true love in this life.  May this movie be an inspiration to the wounded to walk through the fire of honest, hard-core therapy to a place of healing and wholeness.   As a survivor, who is ""still standing,"" and who has run the therapy gauntlet to face down a past that drove me to create my own personal hell, I can attest, with Elton John, it is totally worth it.    (Just know from the outset the scars and coping tendencies remain for life, they just don't control/drive you anymore.  You become much more free to choose your life.)  *My only complaint about this movie, which boldly addresses the horrific realities of addictions, is its use of graphic sex scenes that ironically feed our cultural pornographic sex addictions.

So as they are telling a story, you're taken away to a music video, back to story, then to a music video. Bohemian worked because you didn't have to be a Queen fan. You're not constantly bombarded by full queen songs in the movie and when they do, it's in the background. Rocketman bombards you with full songs and could only be a good thing if you're a John fan. Straight out of Compton was great...but imagine if every 5-10 minutes, you have to listen to a full NWA song? It would make the film horrible.

I thought the biopic part was well done; I had the advantage of watching on DVD so I can skip past the cringeworthy moments: Elton's trysts and the musical fantasy stuff.

Running the strip,  from pool to pool. Living at the lone palm motel. It was the time of my life. My first barbie, wasn't much a doll girl, though I did love sparkles! Loved playing in the desert with the trailer park kids in the early 70's! Mom let us run wild.  I remember the first time someone showed me the album by Elton John. It was too kool, ""Goodbye yellow brick road "" me, being a huge fan of ""the wizard of oz"" I used to make people call me ""Dorothy "" after ""Dorothy Gail"" I was glued to that album cover. It's one of my very first memories after my parents divorce. Then I heard it. That was the best summer of my life. I even learn to swim, saved a kid from drowning too. (Self taught swimmer) Elton and Bernies music got me through the hardest times in my life. I will be forever grateful. Now, seeing this movie, makes me love him that much more. Ny favorite scene had to be the one starting at the troubadour.  We had moved from California in 74 to vegas, so that place that ride down sunset will always be in my mind. The 70s were a different time. I'm so glad  to be a kid in the 70s. A KID not a teen. A kid! The best time of your life. This movie, brought me back. And I'm loving it over and over again.
