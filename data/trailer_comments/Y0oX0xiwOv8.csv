2014-08-01T09:22:23,"Tracy Vanity- While you make a solid point that not enough cultures/races are portrayed in the media, you are sooo off-base on many other levels that I am afraid your type of thinking is part of the problem, not a solution.  First of all, ""Groundbreaking"" refers to the manner in which this film tells its story, not its politics (and to that point it should be noted that most of the ""flawed"" characters in the film are white, and the few minorities represented are seen as honorable, altruistic, and in one instance, arguably the most likable character in the film, but more on that later).  Secondly, you speak of ""Boyhood"" like its some Hollywood Blockbuster that's taking audiences by storm. Have you SEEN it's budget? A meager 2.4 million (Angelina Jolie's catering expenses are more than that per film!)! The average American Film costs 100 million dollars to make (as of 2007) AND they are made within a few months! Let's do some basic math: 2.4 million divided by 12 years is not even the equivalent to pocket change in Hollywood ***If you should be criticizing anybody, it should be the major studios/films, not the indie film artists who are just trying to make art at the grassroots level.****  Next, you bitterly speak of ""White Privilege"", but seriously, you are a little late (like 3 decades) in this ridiculous assertion. I have an ironic tidbit for you: I dated a guy (FYI I'm a gay white male- if you want to talk ""Hollywood Hypocrisy"" let's go down that road later) who was 50% Mexican and 50% Russian Jew. His Mexican mother was a crack head who ditched him and his sister when he was 5 and his bio dad and step mom raised him. Now, as a white ""privileged"" guy, I had the luxury of paying my own way through UT Austin, (same school in the movie, wink wink) while my boyfriend at the time got 100% paid for through Hispanic/Minority scholarships and grants. So here's the irony: he grew up UPPER-MIDDLE CLASS! His dad and step mom were well-off! But because of 50% of his ethnicity, he was seen as a ""minority"" and got a free ride. Now guess who gets to pay for these types of students via heavy taxation? Yup, us middle-class folks, many of whom happen to be 'privileged white', as you so steadfastly pointed out. And my ex HATED the Mexican side of his family! He completely denied it when people asked him about his racial identity! Meanwhile, my good friend from Taiwan, a straight A student who grew up dirt poor in a dangerous part of Houston and attended Cornell University on ACADEMIC scholarships alone, got deported back to Taiwan after she graduated because of a loophole regarding her visa. My point: YES, there is a ridiculously tragic unequal distribution of wealth in this country, and so many more injustices that don't involve money, but it's simply no longer a ""Black and White"" issue, literally and metaphorically. The problem runs much more deeper than skin color, I'm afraid.  Moving on, I don't know what world you live in, but most films of recent history do NOT stereotype people of color (by contrast, you will actually see more and more recent films painting white people in a shameful, one-dimensional light just to prove a point. How about more films like 2004's ""CRASH""- which shows EVERY RACE'S FLAWS in equal measure?). Alas, Political Correctness in the media is becoming increasingly more dangerous these days, as it creates even more boundaries and tension between people, perpetuates counter-racist stereotypes and engenders a ""Victim"" mentality. (While we are on the topic of victim hood, how about more films about the true ""Unsung Heroes"" of our time: i.e. the mentally ill, disfigured, or gender- variant?).  And before you call me a hypocrite, let me tell you now that my current partner is half Mexican and half Italian, and guess what? The Mexican side of his family won't have anything to do with the Italian side and vice versa, for reasons I do not understand. I just stay out of it. So racism does not just exist in American Cinema, or inflicted by ""white"" people unjustly upon other cultures, sorry. And if you actually watch ""Boyhood"", you will see that most of the whites depicted in the film are portrayed as struggling lower-middle class folks who are honest, hard-working people just trying to get by in life (side note: watch the heartfelt scene where the Patricia Arquette character runs into the Mexican waiter that became successful after Arquette urged him to go back to school earlier in the film, again, stressing the common struggles and need for connection between all human beings).  Seriously, if you can't watch a movie like ""Boyhood"" and appreciate it's universality and beauty, then it really is a minor tragedy, since you obviously signify a large growing number of hyper-politically-correct ignoramuses that continue to espouse similar sentiments, without any facts or evidence to support your claims. In the end, all you are doing is creating a political issue out of a piece of art that aims to celebrate life and bring people together, not divide them. As you claim to be an aspiring filmmaker, talk about ""Biting the Hand that Feeds You"". Good luck with all that.

Both audiences and critics alike have declared this film perfect. There should be no doubt, this film is perfect. If you are one of the minority of people who found the film unbecoming, I disagree with you, and so do most who have seen this film.   If there is any justice from the Academy, my point will be reinforced when boyhood sweeps the Oscars this February. Till then, if you want to continue arguing against this film, I suggest you look at a few reviews, both by critics and moviegoers like myself. You'll continue to be defied.  Glad to read all the positive responses though!  #Boyhood  deserves it. A true masterpiece, and a classic in the making. I have seen the film 4 times already, and honestly, I think I'll see it 4 more before the new year. It's THAT good. If you think you might like it, GO SEE IT NOW.

I have lived a very very similar life, eerie but perfect. The acting, the plot that literally follows what we go through, for no reason but that free flowing plot is what makes this film a landmark in cinematography. The awkward moments of adolescence, the young nostalgic days, the moving of homes and new settings and the coming of age when you are leaving the nest are major themes in each of our lives. We were once boys. I just turned 18 myself this year and for some reason this movie just speaks to this generation, the generation who lived from the 1990s and so on.  I am forever linked with this movie and one day wish to share my own story.

It's good to have realism in a movie, but not to the point where this movie could have easily been substituted by my life if I had decided to leave a Go-Pro camera attached to my head 24/7. I will make the claim that this movie was terribly unappealing. I personally feel that the movie is nothing more than an ""artsy-fartsy"" attempt at showcasing perplexing depth. The ""reality"" is that the plot was non-existent, the characters dull, and the main character an unlikable degenerate that exhibited no interest, emotion, or remorse for his actions.

I grew up during the same generation and everything from the GameBoy, to the elementary school desks/chairs, to the little girl singing along to High School Musical made me reminisce on these insignificant things that were once a part of my daily life as a kid. You kind of just grow up, and when you look back, you wonder ""when was the last time I..."" used my Gameboy, went bowling/bonded with my dad, gossiped with my friends from school, didn't do my chores as I was told, had my first beer, etc.   The journey through ""Mason Jr.'s"" life was so amazing to watch.  The little pieces of pop-culture interlaced through each passing year, (GameBoy, iPod, Facebook) made me feel connected to the movie.

The kid's dad was the better character.  There's no action, no suspense, no color, and some things pretty unrealistic.  Are people really this blah and shallow in real life?  I'm not trying to hate on it, just simply expressing that I didn't care for it.  My own boyhood / childhood was way more interesting than this.

I mean the movie is of a span of his entire life, how the fuck does nothing happen? Yeah, it's cool to see the same kid actors grow up, I actually didn't even know they filmed this for so many years until half way when I noticed the characters getting older and still being the same person. So that's kind of cool. But that's it. None of the dialogue is smart or relevant. There's no character development. Nothing is solved. The characters just get older, and it's so boring. They have the longest conversations that get their character no where. The most interesting character was probably the dad in that there's the scene he's talking politics and then years later he has the kids putting up Obama signs. Like that's the only connecting thing. He also matures. But the main characters are bores to watch.",0,1,M,Y0oX0xiwOv8,0.11055996472663139,2017-08-15 16:11:22,False,False

If you are like me, an overthinker, and you philosophize a lot, you think about life often. Sometimes why we are here, why life is so good and why it is so boring. The questions about life that we can not answer. This movie was great. I ended up spending my day doing other things rather than sitting on my phone, because we do spend a lot of time on it. I realize that, and I always try to be better at just being in the moment and not letting my phone control me. Even though I am 16, soon to be 17, I think about life, and I don't really want to grow up fast. That is why I don't mind school. A lot of people at my age hates school. Of course I don't like exams and stuff like that, but I have to enjoy my teenage years that I will not experience more than once.  I love movies like these about life.

2019-11-18T21:16:30,"Boyhood is undoubtedly one of the most haunting films ever made. I cried so MUCH. Mason's story reminded me in some parts of mine. It was an out of body experience to watch it. It was disheartening, gutwrenching and beautiful to watch this kid grow up. It made me realize how time flew and flies so rapidly, how fragile and fleeting life can be, how in the blink of an eye you were an innocuous kid, then a rambunctious teen and turning without warning as a full blown adult. And in between, you face predicaments, deaths in the family and in your friends' group, drama, confusion, angst, first times, first kisses, meet your best friends who might stick till the end or not, lose your virginity or not, succeed at school or fail expeditiously, you live to the fullest until settling down, move-ins and move-outs, witness your parents fighting, have your first dog, spend countless sleepovers talking about girls or boys even both, gossip about anyone at school and playing videogames, go to camp spending summers of a lifetime with kids you'll never see again or not, you crush on other people, you get your heart broken, you fight with your parents and siblings, you're looking for who you want to be, you suffer but you laugh but most importantly, you learn how to LIVE. And still, the older you get, you never cease learning and growing. Watching Boyhood left me reeling and crying for a whole night. But I felt pride and closure. My past has been a tainted, wild journey but turning into a 28 year old graduate from grad school with a Master's degree, living in Paris and able to withstand depression, two suicide attempts, being a gifted child with ADHD, bullying and being bullied, my mom's car crash, losing some friends to untimely deaths or by going to jail for drug selling or murder and overcoming alcohol abuse. Boyhood is not only a movie but a statement of life's beauty of life's fast but invisible pace, of time's unfathomable but irresistible grip on our fate. It's an embodiment of what time is, how every single decision and mistake contained in one life can shape and affect you but not necessarily determine who you'll become. It's a wheel in constant motion which takes us, rolls us along, makes us grow young then old to eventually kill us.",26,0,Moise Mensah,Y0oX0xiwOv8,0.14177394243183716,2019-11-18 21:16:30,False,False

2020-04-03T18:04:10,"I first watched this movie when it came out back in 2014 because of the Oscar buzz. I was in 9th grade at that time and had just started my movie watching journey stepping out of mainstream cinema and this film felt just okay. It was worth watching but I really couldn't understand why it garnered as much praise as it did.   After about 6 years I stumbled upon 'Hero' by Family of the Year (the defining song of this movie) which made me want to revisit this film and maybe gain a new perspective about it.    So I watched it and here is what I feel about this movie: IT IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE AND WILL PROBABLY EVER GET TO SEE!   The 2 hour 45 min runtime feels like a long, scenic temporal journey highlighting the 12 year journey the film itself embarks upon.   I can try to explain what makes this movie good but it's technical merits are really immaterial. It is a work of art that transcends the boundary of the screen into something a lot bigger and more magnificent. This is one of those rare films which stands above labels such such as 'brilliant' or 'masterpiece'.   This film really made me feel something that I cannot put into words no matter how hard I try. I'm just thankful to the cast and crew that made this film what it is and obviously the man behind it all - Richard Linklater. I love you man!!!

Gostei bastante. Comecei pesquisar mais sobre o sobre a produção do filme e o diretor Richard Linklater não queria usar maquiagem para envelhecer os atores ou mesmo trocá-los durante a filmagem, por isso, ele manteve o mesmo elenco e gravou o filme durante 12 anos. Eu estava assistindo o filme por partes, assisti uns 30 minutos ai depois mais um pouco e tal, quando eu comecei a perceber e os atores estavam envelhecendo e eram as mesmas pessoas, resolvi pesquisar, mais sobre o filme. Estou assistindo agora pela segunda vez com mais atenção, pois não acompanhei direito na primeira vez, gostei da história..👍👍👍👍 Como tudo na vida, tem gente que não vai gostar, mas acredito que a maioria vai curtir demais a evolução e o crescimento do Ellar Coltrane Kinney Salmon.
