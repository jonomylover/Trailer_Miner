2018-03-27T15:38:52,"ITALIANO (ITALIAN):  Guardando questo film ho capito che non √® certamente adatto a tutti per le troppe scene romantiche che sicuramente schiferanno i pi√π piccoli ma soprattutto perch√© √® troppo e dico troppo drammatico. La parte del film che non mi √® piaciuta per niente √® stata quella in cui Dawson, tornato da una nuotata entra nella camera da letto vedendo Amanda (adolescente), coperta solo con un accappatoio  seduta sul letto dicendogli che non vedeva l'ora di farlo, Dawson le chiede se √® sicura di essere pronta, lei annuisce e cos√¨ via (per non dire altro). Ma se per esempio un bambino sta guardando questo film con la sua famiglia e  arrivata questa scena chiede ai suoi genitori di cosa stanno parlando, secondo voi i genitori avrebbero il coraggio di rovinare l'infanzia di quel povero bambino? Io sinceramente non credo proprio. Tra l' altro secondo me non era necessario evidenziare troppo questa scena anche perch√© se leggete la trama, i due ragazzi sono ancora al liceo, quindi ci√≤ si poteva anche evitare. Tralasciando per√≤ queste piccole osservazioni il film √® molto bello e sopratutto significativo, consiglio a tutti di vederlo.  INGLESE (ENGLISH):  Watching this film I realized that it is certainly not suitable for all too many romantic scenes that will surely disgust the little ones but especially because it is too much and I say too dramatic. The part of the film that I did not like at all was that when Dawson, back from a swim, enters the bedroom seeing Amanda (teenager), covered only with a bathrobe sitting on the bed telling him that he could not wait to do it Dawson asks her if she's sure she's ready, she nods and so on (to say the least). But if, for example, a child is watching this film with his family and when this scene asks his parents what they are talking about, do you think parents would have the courage to ruin the childhood of that poor child? I honestly do not think so. Among other things I think it was not necessary to highlight too much this scene because if you read the plot, the two boys are still in high school, so this could also be avoided. Leaving aside these small observations, however, the film is very beautiful and above all significant, I advise everyone to see it.",0,0,benedetta aletta,cQszhfoP_WI,0.04766025641025641,2018-03-27 15:38:52,False,False

2018-07-28T00:55:20,"This movie is my story. I went to the UK to study. The love of my life initiated no contact because she didn't know when I would be back. I begged her to stay in touch, but she just stopped replying. Later I learned that she was crying for about six months because she missed me so badly. She really didn't know how to deal with it. Women can be so irrational. Instead of staying in touch, she chose this. Because of all of this, I could never really enjoy the UK. I felt homesick most of the time and missed her every day. Eventually, after about two years, I got over it and just gave up on her. 5 years later, I'm back home and in a relationship and we meet again. She had just become a mother. But you could tell, our feelings really haven't changed at all. I felt this warmth I would never feel with my then girlfriend. And she felt the same. As fate would want it, we saw each other more often and it started all over again. I know exactly how stupid you feel, when her boyfriend called. It felt so wrong. I don't cheat and didn't want others to cheat for me. So at one point I decided that it's probably not a good idea to keep seeing her. It also made me mad that she already had a child with someone else. 5 more years pass and we are still both thinking about each other. It really makes you wonder what it's all about.",0,0,/dev/null,cQszhfoP_WI,-0.03522727272727271,2018-07-28 00:55:20,False,False
