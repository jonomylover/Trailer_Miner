(Like the shower scene in Bullet Proof which uses the trailer song) Would not take a bullet for the escort. Takes a bullet for the escort in the end.  Etc.  Side note, Netflix is a supremely liberal company and act like people can't tell the underlying tones throughout their movies. Anti-Russian (Bad guy being the Russian President) Spanish > Whites (Showing a white woman being forced by Salma Hayek into time-out inside the jail) Etc.  Just pay attention and you'll start noticing this garbage in these liberal companies movies. It is recurring and somebody specifically filled those roles and wrote the script that way on purpose. They knew they were ripping off Bullet Proof and cleverly used the shower song in the trailer but they added their own liberal twist in the mix throughout the movie. I honestly wouldn't doubt if race reversal having the black man in cuffs this time is also symbolic to white man enslaving African Americans.  ...Or maybe I'm too high. idk So sick of politics digging in to things I love that I start seeing bias everywhere now.

2017-09-16T23:55:26,"(Spoilers) I saw this movie yesterday and I really didn't like it.I hadn't seen the trailer, so I had no expectations of the film, and it still didn't meet those. The opening shots of London made me cringe, as a Londoner myself it's the same shot of the London eye/ Tower of London/tower bridge view that every film uses. its repetitive and annoying and was the first indication that I was not going to enjoy this film. The morning I watched it there had been a terrorist incident in south London, so seeing huge explosions in central, and gunfights on the streets as an exposition threw me onto an edge as a reality that I feel everyday when I take public transport. Not only does the film have unnecessary violence at every corner, it contradicts its own themes by trying to be to be funny, but there is so little continuation in the plot that the jokes don't make sense and throw the audience into an internal debate about what the film is trying to commentate. The premise is present as a buddy comedy about two mismatched characters who are forced together under unforeseen circumstances, but the whole reason this happens is due to a corrupt politician who has killed innocent people which links to the hitman in a court case. The entire film felt like the build up to an intense political drama exploring corruption and bribery in the justice system, but the whole statement given later the whole of 10 minutes, and is then interrupted by more explosions. The writers of this film haven't pieced it together well- it is a mixup of countries,characters, and storylines. The wife of the hitman is an unnecessary character perhaps only used for some jokes, the plot she contributes could easily be given to another character. A movie should be concise and the plot should move with the development of the audiences understanding. 'The Hitmans Bodyguard' ultimately is the opposite of this as there are more elements in this disaster than in the periodic table. The movie ends inside a flashback, a cheap move that doesn't leave the watcher satisfied and adds to the overall strained relationship that Reynolds and Jackson have with the 'comedy' written in. The amount of times the hitman laughs in serious moments becomes a scapegoat relief that's thrown in to try to keep the audience involved(it doesn't work). Even though I was dissatisfied overall, the 'black betty' sequence was incredible. The choreography to the song joined with the gymnastic camera angles amazed me. I remarked ""it's the only 5 minutes of the movie with any thought put into it"", but the high budget feel of all the explosions, violence, and gore make me wonder what the directors were thinking to the other 2 hours of the film. I wish this had been a good movie as there was opportunity, but that's Hollywood- a film based entirely in Europe with a 90% American cast. 3/10 (the 3 is for the amount of minutes I enjoyed)",1,0,Eliza Duncan,F4Afusxc2SM,0.08050653594771241,2017-09-16 23:55:26,False,True

2017-11-25T16:40:48,"Full disclosure, I find both the main actors in this film both overrated, and or annoying, depending on the movie. The Hitman's Bodyguard is loaded with unrealistic action scenes (cars exploding when shot, etc...) , gratuitous violence, non stop profanity, and predictable love interests. The entire formula should equal a totally unremarkable modern buddy movie. Yet, it didn't suck! There appears real chemistry between Reynolds and Jackson, and the supporting cast (great to see Oldman and Hayek on screen) is excellent, and the dialogue original and legit LOL in spots. The camera work is quite impressive, and although often eye rolling, the action sequences, chase scenes, etc are very well done. Finally, the plot was original at least, even if the ending not so much. The movie does drag in spots and could have been fifteen minutes or so shorter.
