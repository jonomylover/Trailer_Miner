Although he had everything his heart desired,  The Prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.  But then, one winter's night,  An old beggar woman came to the castle  And offered him a single rose In return for shelter from the bitter cold.  Repulsed by her haggard appearance,  The Prince sneered at the gift,  And turned the old woman away.  But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances,  For Beauty is found within.  And when he dismissed her again,  The old woman's ugliness melted away  To reveal a beautiful Enchantress.  The Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,  For she had seen that there was no love in his heart.  And as punishment,  She transformed him into a hideous beast,  And placed a powerful spell on the castle,  And all who lived there.  Ashamed of his monstrous form,  The beast concealed himself inside his castle,  With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.  The Rose she had offered,  Was truly an enchanted rose,  Which would bloom until his twenty-first year.  If he could learn to love another,  And earn her love in return  By the time the last petal fell,  Then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast  For all time.  As the years passed,  He fell into despair, and lost all hope,  For who could ever learn to love... a Beast?",1,0,Christian Yancey,c38r-SAnTWM,0.11785714285714287,2016-05-23 13:50:46,True,True

2016-05-23T14:30:09,"Once upon a time in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a shining castle. Although he had everything his heart desired, the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind. But then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart. And as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there.  Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose which would bloom until his 21st year. If he could learn to love another and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair and lost all hope for who could ever learn to love a beast?",0,0,WHiiTExV3N0M,c38r-SAnTWM,0.11314285714285716,2016-05-23 14:30:09,True,True

The music with the piano was just simply beautiful from the opening music to the end with the film’s theme song (I got a little teary eyed at that part).  Its cool to see the Beast’s castle transcend from pleasant and beautiful castle to a place that is dark and somewhat eerie. As for Emma Watson as Belle, despite you can see only a tiny glimpse of her at the end of the trailer you can already tell that she fits the character perfectly and you can see it in her eyes. I know that she is going to an amazing job bringing one of my favourite Disney Princesses to life. This film is going to be a magical, wonderful, musical, and just another great live-action fairy tale come to life. A tale as old as time.

According to IMDB, Ewan McGregor is supposed to be Lumiere, a candlestick that impersonates  Maurice Chevalier, and he really doesn't. I thought Ian McKellen's voice was the perfect Lumiere until I read that he plays Cogsworth! Ewan must have been cast as Lumiere only because he can sing, overlooking the fact that he cannot keep a french accent or sound anything like the original character which is sad. Sorry for the rant, it really just irked me that they screwed up Lumiere, he's my fave character so naturally I'm disappointed.

The characters were well thought out, the beast looked like an actual beast and the villain was well developed. The time it took to have the characters fall in love was great, since they didn't just meet and fall in love instantly. The songs were great, the art was great, and even the side characters were great. The suspense, the drama, the happiness, the tear jerks were planed out well. The only thing bad was the way the beast looked as human. Maybe they could have kept him the beast at the end or not but the only reason why I have that one nit pit was because we fell in love with the beast and not the human. Besides that it was an amazing movie. The fact that they are remaking their very best film (aside from Toy Story) is that they have run out of ideas. Disney I hate to say it since I love you but, Just stop, please just stop. These remakes aren't helping you in any way. Come up with some new original ideas for shows and movies. The shows are good(except Gravity Falls with is awesome) but the movies are just turning into stereotypes after stereotypes, with bland character/actors, and remakes that make the remake worse, not better .

2016-05-23T19:45:51,"Here’s your first look at Beauty and the Beast, a live-action retelling of the Disney classic🌹Coming to theatres 3.17.17. #BeOurGuest  Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” is a live-action re-telling of the studio’s animated classic which refashions the classic characters from the tale as old as time for a contemporary audience, staying true to the original music while updating the score with several new songs. “Beauty and the Beast” is the fantastic journey of Belle, a bright, beautiful and independent young woman who is taken prisoner by a beast in his castle. Despite her fears, she befriends the castle’s enchanted staff and learns to look beyond the Beast’s hideous exterior and realize the kind heart and soul of the true Prince within. The film stars: Emma Watson as Belle; Dan Stevens as the Beast; Luke Evans as Gaston, the handsome, but shallow villager who woos Belle; Oscar® winner Kevin Kline as Maurice, Belle’s eccentric, but lovable father; Josh Gad as Lefou, Gaston’s long-suffering aide-de-camp; Golden Globe® nominee Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, the candelabra; Oscar nominee Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza, the harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette, the feather duster; six-time Tony Award® winner Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe, the wardrobe; Oscar nominee Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, the mantel clock; and two-time Academy Award® winner Emma Thompson as the teapot, Mrs. Potts.  Directed by Oscar® winner Bill Condon from a screenplay by TBD based on the 1991 animated film, the film is produced by Mandeville Films’ David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman with eight-time Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken, who won two Academy Awards® (Best Original Score and Best Song) for the 1991 animated film, providing the score, which will include new recordings of the original songs written by Menken and Howard Ashman, as well as several new songs written by Menken and three-time Oscar winner Tim Rice. “Beauty and the Beast” will be released in U.S. theaters on March 17, 2017.",0,0,Phiedrax,c38r-SAnTWM,0.310741341991342,2016-05-23 19:45:51,True,True

I'm really glad they seem to be staying true to the original story rather than reimagining it too much. However, I just can't get behind Emma Watson as Belle. In the original animated move, Belle was such a strong female character, and I just don't get that same feeling of strength from Emma Watson. Her voice is too mousy and her body frame is too small. Anne Hathaway would have been perfect for this role 5 or 10 years ago, but she's probably too old now. Oh well.

But then, one winter's night,  An old beggar woman came to the castle  And offered him a single rose In return for shelter from the bitter cold.  Repulsed by her haggard appearance,  The Prince sneered at the gift,  And turned the old woman away.  But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances,  For Beauty is found within.  And when he dismissed her again,  The old woman's ugliness melted away  To reveal a beautiful Enchantress.  The Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,  For she had seen that there was no love in his heart.  And as punishment,  She transformed him into a hideous beast,  And placed a powerful spell on the castle,  And all who lived there.  Ashamed of his monstrous form,  The beast concealed himself inside his castle,  With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.  The Rose she had offered,  Was truly an enchanted rose,  Which would bloom until his twenty-first year.  If he could learn to love another,  And earn her love in return  By the time the last petal fell,  Then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast  For all time.  As the years passed,  He fell into despair, and lost all hope,  For who could ever learn to love... a Beast?",0,0,Kyle Chang,c38r-SAnTWM,0.11785714285714287,2016-05-24 00:26:55,True,True

The side cast was super underdeveloped, it wasted too much time on the mice and stuff, and the main romance was just complete crap. I disagreed with how they changed the main character to an extent, but there was actual room for improvement there. With Beauty and the Beast, that just really isn't a thing. The story already had a great plot, solid execution, well done characters all the way around, and a really good climax. It's the type of classic where there really isn't any way to just do it better, especially in live action where the living objects and the Beast simply won't translate anywhere near as good as they do in an already animated movie. This just seems completely unnecessary and there's just no way it's going to be able to live up to the original film, so why even try instead of going out to make something original and new?  I know that sounds weird since the Disney film was based on an existing film, but I mean, come on! There's no way this is going to work as well so why is this even a thing?

2016-05-24T02:12:20,"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (LA BELLA Y LA BESTIA) basada en  la serie televisiva de los 70's-80's, y que se enfocaba en el deseo de protección de la Bestia por la heroína Belle, defendiéndola de sus perseguidores.    En la película de Disney, trataba del mismo tema, en el cual la Bestia, un personaje con fisonomía atroz se escondía de sus semejantes, viviendo en la obscuridad, pero tenía sentimientos como cualquier ser viviente, que aislado por los complejos y temores propios de su físico, huía y se escondía de la sociedad. Héroe y protector de  Belle, de quien se enamoró, abrió su corazón a un mundo de amor y de entendimiento; ayudándolo Belle a conocerse así mismo, y darse cuenta de que el físico NO era lo más importante, sino la manera de ser, que muy pocos podían conocer de él, y que solamente, La Bestia se atrevía a demostrarle a su princesa.    Una de las películas favoritas de los niños en la década de los 90's; favorita también de las mamás de aquella generación en la que me incluyo, que ahora nos han hecho abuelas, y que tanto disfrutamos la mayoría; y aún en los desfiles de luces en las paradas de Disneyland en Anaheim, CA, Estados Unidos.   Según,  la información que hemos leído en YOUTUBE.COM, esta película se estrenará el 03/17/17.  Y de acuerdo a la información que nos proveen aquí, está basada en la misma historia de Belle, la dulce y tierna chica que personifica a la amada de La Bestia, pero con el giro que ha realizado los Estudios Disney, y adoptada para la generación actual.    Bien, no me importa si alguno de los actores principales de este film se ha ganado un Oscar o no.  Lo cierto es que, en lo personal no me ha gustado ninguna de las adaptaciones de las últimas películas de Disney, ya que los malos de la película, ahora se reflejan mucho más malvados que antes, destruyendo la inocencia, y la candidez de nuestros pequeños.  Que más que gustarles, les atemoriza; y no podemos ni debemos levantar a nuestros pequeños con tantos temores, aún, más de los que ya existen.    Si bien es cierto, que debemos educarles y enseñarles a protegerse de extraños y en las diversas situaciones en las cuales puedan correr algún tipo de riesgos o peligros; también estamos creándoles mayores temores y desconfianzas, y sembrándoles miedos innecesarios que no les ayudan en su desarrollo mental y psicológico.    Bien sabido es por todos los que hemos estudiado nociones de psicología, y nos hemos cultivado en esta rama de la ciencia de la mente, que NO es correcto crear temores infundados en nuestros pequeños que le restan confianza en sí mismos, y les dificulta en sus relaciones humanas, y en el desarrollo  social.  Ojalá, y los cuentos del MARAVILLOSO Y FANTÁSTICO MUNDO DE DISNEY VUELVA A REALIZAR FILMS CON LA ESENCIA MÁS PURA, Y NO DESCABELLADA DE LAS PELÍCULAS DE TERROR DE ALFRED HITCOCK; ya que es parte de LA FILOSOFÍA DE DISNEY, cooperar en el desarrollo social, a través del entretenimiento, y el buen servicio al cliente.  Yo, que desde niña he sido seguidora de Walt Disney, consumidora a gran escala de sus servicios y productos no he escrito este comentario como una CRÍTICA DESTRUCTIVA, sino como UNA CRÍTICA CONSTRUCTIVA por el bien de mis nietos y todos los niños y padres del mundo, que deseamos para ellos un mundo y un entorno mejor.  No critico las nuevas adaptaciones, puesto que la sociedad y su sistema es cambiante, y debemos adaptarnos a los cambios de la sociedad y las tendencias; pero, si en nuestras manos está mantener aquello que es la esencia humana en la balanza con mayor bondad, y conservarla, creo que sería mejor para todos.  Ya hay suficientes productoras y peliculeras que se dedican a estos tipos de películas, ¿No lo creen?  Por lo poco que he podido ver y escuchar aquí, la filmación se ve muy nítida como siempre, los efectos de sonido y musicalización, también; el audio suena impecable, y seguramente, como siempre será una película taquillera, no lo dudo.  -Edna Paz- Panamá, República de Panamá, 23/05/2016 -",0,0,Edna Paz,c38r-SAnTWM,-0.00666666666666667,2016-05-24 02:12:20,True,True

Here’s a quick test: Have you ever lied, stolen, or used God’s name in vain? Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” If you have done these things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart, and the Bible warns that one day God will punish you in a terrible place called Hell. But God is not willing that any should perish. Sinners broke God’s Law and Jesus paid their fine. This means that God can legally dismiss their case: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Then Jesus rose from the dead, defeating death. Today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will give you eternal life as a free gift. Then read the Bible daily and obey it.

There's really no point to do remakes of these movie, the original's arguably not even that old (depending on whether a 1991 movie is considered old at this point) so really I just hope I don't see stupid live action versions of Lilo and Stitch or Aladdin or whatever.

But then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away. But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart. And as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his 21st year. If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair and lost all hope. For who could ever learn to love a beast?",0,0,Dan Waller,c38r-SAnTWM,0.11314285714285716,2016-05-24 05:17:24,True,True

I was napping when I heard the song playing and ran to my mom and sister who showed me the trailer. I think I'm the only one of the three who recognized the score. I;m so happy they decided to use that for the first trailer. This is the best kind of trailer. They barely show any big details in order to not give things away but what they do show traps the mind and ensnares the senses.   +Space Fan Alien Robot I noticed that too! When I was telling my mom she looked so surprised! I guess she never considered it since she was distracted watching the movie with me but I always felt so bad for poor Adam. I mean, yes he was a brat, but can you honestly tell me eleven-year-olds are never brats.   Not to insult the story, though. I love Beauty and the Beast. Belle was always my favorite since I found her so relatable. And when Emma was announced to be playing Belle I was jumping around all day. My favorite actress playing my favorite Princess. I really want to hear her singing ""Belle"" and ""Something There"" I think I'm even more excited than my sister was when she found out about the live-action Cinderella movie last year.   And Lumiere! His accent was so on spot! It reminded me of watching the original movie. And Cogsworth! So many happy feeling right now!  ""Be Our Guest"" is going to be fantastic!  And Emma Thompson is playing Mrs. Potts! I can't wait to hear her sing ""Beauty and the Beast."" I'm sure she'll do a brilliant job.   So many feels with the trailer right now.

Her father battles with this discovery throughout the movie but he eventually learns that it's okay that she likes other girls and that he was wrong to be upset. The Beast also becomes frustrated that she's not attracted to him so he begins to wear make-up and pretty dresses to try and appeal to her. He later discovers that he actually enjoys dressing up as a woman and he begins his magical journey to becoming transgender.,0,0,Bertis,c38r-SAnTWM,0.04166666666666667,2016-05-24 12:16:28,True,True

Retelling the same story like Cinderella or Alice in Wonderland is just lazy. I feel insulted as a consumer, to be honest. I'm not going to spend my money to watch the exact same thing I did all those years ago. It's lazy, it's a money grab. The fact that they've been remaking movies this long is just painful for me. And some of the retellings, in my opinion, are much worse than the original, like Maleficent. So if this is a retelling, I'll hate it. If it's a remake, I'll hate it.

I guess they did a bit, they changed it too much, and in this version they seem to be following the cartoon exactly.   But it's sad that Disney is even remaking these movie. ONLY reason they are making it is to cash in on all the 'nostalgia'. Sad that people these days don't get what original ideas are any more. Everything is based on a book, tv show, comic, etc....no new ideas. What will happen 10 years from now? Re-make of a remake?  Also when I heard Emma Watson was cast in this I was pissed. She can't act, wooden actress. And Belle is a very expressive character. Sad, that the only reason that people will see the movie is for her! Even tho she can't act. It's funny that she is in all these feminist things, yet the only reason she was cast/made famous/became successful was for a sexist reason! Her appearance.

I would imagine Felicity Jones as Beauty, Felicity best fits the character. And I'm not sure about beast but I imagine an actor like Jared Letto with his hairy style. I'd wanted to recognize my characters as I remember, Bella was sweet and innocent looking and "" Beast "" was rebellious, imposing, savage and powerful! Emma is very serious and mysterious for their own facial features and the other actor remembers me Draco Malfoy xD giving me the impression of being a pampered and spoiled child instead of rebellious one. Seriously this Beast is a fucking puppie, there's no vision in the animation team? Beast should be fucking epic,  giant, and more like a wolf instead of a lion, I don't imagine this puppie fighting against the wolf pack in the epic way ""Beast"" does in the cartoon movie. Anyway, I hope the performance to be excellent , as is a movie that I loved a lot in my childhood.

Although he had everything his heart desired, the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind. But then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift, and turned the old woman away. But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late. For she had seen that there was no love in his heart. And as punishment she transformed him into a hideous beast, and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his twenty-first year. If he could learn to love another and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, then, the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair and lost all hope... for who could ever learn to love a beast?""",0,0,Jacob Dahl,c38r-SAnTWM,0.11785714285714287,2016-05-26 06:31:42,True,True

2016-05-29T19:50:22,"I hope with this re-make, Disney doesn't f*** up the design/looks for the Beast. What made the Beast effective in the animated movie was he was imposing, large, threatening, scary and ferocious (like when he confronted Belle in the West Wing) and he was bad-ass, especially when he took on the wolves that were attacking Belle. But when he is mellow and during his light-hearted/comedic moments and has softened his heart towards Belle, he is cuddly and adorable just like a big teddy bear. That same effect is what Disney needs to achieve again with the Beast. I bet they will be motion-capturing the crap out of Dan Stevens who will be playing Beast/Adam. I hope they just don't slap a costume on Dan Stevens like what they did in the Broadway play. I want the Beast to look every bit as much as what he looked like in the animated movie, but since this is a live-action movie, the Beast would be photo-realistic. All Disney needs to do is look at the original beast and envision him as what/how he would look like if he existed in real life. And I hope Belle calls him by his name this time - Adam - instead of calling him ""Beast"". i mean, they've gotten to know each other real well during Belle's time there at his castle and then when she comes back for him, she still calls him ""Beast"".

This is an all star cast including Emma Watson, Luke Evans, Ewan McGregor and to top it off, SIR Ian McKellen - heaps of onscreen talent! Composer Alan Menken is back and as we already know, the original and fantastic soundtrack is being reused (with a few additions).  Also, after Disney's Cinderella remake which was also amazing (why are people saying otherwise? I don't know), I am anticipating more than ever Belle's yellow ballgown - that will be the determining factor as to whether this movie cuts it or not. However, I am positive Disney is well aware of the potential risk for ruining a much loved story and I am sure that this will surpass Maleficent (easily, no questions asked) and Cinderella.    In short, this is going to be amazing!! :)   Wow. I feel like  a Disney spokesperson or something",1,0,Christina Buhagiar,c38r-SAnTWM,0.2639309764309764,2016-06-01 08:29:02,True,True

2016-06-01T15:03:34,"Dear Disney,   When I was small your films were ingenious, fun, magical and bewitching. Now that I am less small I notice your films have changed. They're all so incredibly dark and action ridden, they seriously lack humour and individuality, in fact they all appear to merge in to one ( I am not sure the orchestrated choir needs to appear in every film to signify magic ). Why the darkness? Isn't there a little bit too much darkness in the world right now? Don't our children deserve a little bit more fantasy and humour and playfulness. And lightness? That's what I used to count on Disney for. Everything doesn't have to be epic. Every actor doesn't have to be given a hand with constantly overpowering music. Let them do their job without so much help. They're getting paid pretty well. The same applies to CGI. And surely there are so many talents out there with great stories waiting to be told, without merely re-doing what has been told so well. Don't be so lazy, it should be such a joy finding new formulas. I just saw 'Alice through the Looking Glass' and couldn't have been more bored. I left the cinema feeling so incredibly disappointed and let down. But not all is bad, we still have all of your old movies to watch when humour was key and action was necessary. Plus, we still have Pixar, which although I know is now 'owned' by Disney. I see Pixar nowadays as a classier Disney. Disney to me now seems like a bunch of suits in a room. Pixar on the other hand don't seem to adhere to the belief that every scene needs music, I am not aware of them bringing in that children's choir just yet and their darkness to lightness ration seems pretty spot on! Times change I know, but there are reasons why Mary Poppins is still so popular to this day, perhaps do a little homework and work out how. Good luck with the next one.

It's a very particular sweet spot that needs to be nailed perfectly. Otherwise, his accent is so thick that it ends up sounding really dumb. It's a shame too, because Ewan McGregor is a great actor.

The reason these classic Disney movies are so fantastical is they're animated. When they're turned into live-action, they become grounded. It's not a fairy tale anymore when it's made live-action; the charm the animation brought to it can't exist. That doesn't mean this won't still be a great movie, but it won't be Beaut and the Beast. I can't imagine anyone being happy if a fully CG version came out (even if you kept Emma Watson as the voice of Belle). They would say it undermines the integrity of the classic animation, and there's no point to making it CG. Well, my friends, that's the same thing with making a live-action version. Snow White, Cinderella, Peter Pan, 101 Dalmations, The Jungle Book, and now this.

2016-06-06T17:16:32,"Belle DOES NOT have Stockholm Syndrome! I am so sick of people writing in the comments Things like ""Belle is stupid because she only fall in love because of the Stockholm Syndrome"" like they would know everything about mental illnesses or the movie. While most of the people who claim this stuff either don't know what Stockholm Syndrome really means or just didnt watch the movie (or they watched it a too long time ago so they simply don't remember most of the story). It could be that in other adoptations of the fairy tale the beauty really has this illness, but Disney did a really great job in not falling into this trap and made the story very believable. If you don't believe me look at the official definition of Stockholm Syndrom, it says ""Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors ..."" Alright so you might think now ""but thats exactly what happened in the film"", right? Then it's time for you to watch that movie again because Belle is far away from having Stockholm Syndrome! She has a really strong and independent personality and she doesn't care what society expects her to do. If she really had Stockholm Syndrom she would have fallen in love with Gaston a long time ago, because he treats her like an object or a trophy, but instead she always avoids him. And when she got imprisoned by the beast, it looked more like she hated him. Only when she flee from the castle and the beast saved her from the wolves by risking his life, she helped him as an act of compassion. After that the love story began, and not after the capturing! So stop just buying everything the internet says. This lie only went around because people want to believe in scandals and therefore don't even verify rather it's true or not. And stop saying ""It's true because I read it somewher in the internet"" because that is stupid and I hate it so much. And please stop trying to make one of my favourite movies of all time bitter to me, thanks!

2016-06-10T18:55:05,"Beauty and the Beast (1991) is probably my all time favorite Disney  Princess film (a concept caching in on the Disney Princess and fairy  tale aspect). Not only was it nominated for Best Picture, it pretty much  made light of any other Disney film, be it Up or Toy Story 3 to be  nominated for an Oscar. At that time, that was unheard of. The story was  great, the characters were great, the songs were great and the  animation was unbelievable...  Unfortunately I am not. Because I fail to see what this film is going to  accomplish. But, that's to be said with most Disney live action remakes  nowadays, trying to, ""introduce a brand new audience to Disney with  live action remakes of the original animated films"". And while studies,  REALLY haven't pointed it out yet. There's a lot more I could bring up  with this movie. I'm not excited for this movie at all.   For one, making a remake of an original Disney film isn't going to win  any awards like it did last time. Second, is the music. While they are  getting the original composer Alan Menken to compose the film, sadly,  I'm not too sure how they're gonna be doing it. Also, is Celine Dion  gonna resing the song too? Third, the characters. Before I judge  anything else, I can't really blame them for getting big name actors and  actresses to play these roles. Unfortunately, I'm not really buying  Hermione as Belle when all I hear is Hermione as Belle. No offense to  Emma Watson. Fourthly is CG. I swear to Christ. Disney has a problem  with not putting enough practical effects to blend in with the amount of  CG put across it. Like for instance, make an actual model of the  castle, and not have it all CG? Prosthetic makeup for the Beast,  perhaps? (Even though I haven't seen it, I'm kinda guessing it to be CG  sadly) and a few other things.   Honestly, I really hope this film holds up, but I am kinda afraid of it  failing even though a lot of people are excited for this film, I just  thought I should get out there.",0,0,Scarfy Conly,c38r-SAnTWM,0.1784090909090909,2016-06-10 18:55:05,True,True

I don't want the CGI or the painted faces, I want the life-like cartoon style drawings!   I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. Call me ol' fashioned but there's so much at stake here remaking these classic movies that has grounded many of our childhoods in the 90's Disney Renaissance era.

Which is in 10 years,implying he was 11.... Even though he was an adult... I think they ARE actually making him 11 now when he was transformed, which could possibly mean that the enchantress gets a larger role as A villain even with Gaston's presence, since why would you curse everyone else in the castle when it was the prince who had no love? By his spoiled demeanour, I don't think he would care.    Actually that would have been cool in the first movie if the Enchantress was the villain, where it could turn out that she had a deep seeded anger and jealousy for the prince as she beloved he had no love in his heart...

I think for me, it's because they cut back on the songs. I grew up on Disney movies, these feel more on our level now as we've grown up. Maleficent was amazing, Jungle Book was okay(didn't like the cartoon much in the first place), Cinderella was great(didn't like that cartoon much but loved the movie). I really hope Disney keeps making their movies into live action. Would be really excited for The Little Mermaid, maybe an Ursula movie(like how they're doing Cruella).

2016-10-11T03:14:51,"Hm.  I'm not especially excited for this movie, but this is definitely a good trailer, at any rate.  And the movie will probably be okay, but I mean, I'm kind of biased because I'm that guy who, when he watches Beauty and the Beast, just spends a day watching it 3 or 4 times in one sitting, first normally, then with commentary, and finally the rough cut before they finalized all of the animation.  What I'm saying is, while I have a softer spot in my heart for Aladdin(the first movie I ever saw, ever), I really do feel like Beauty and the Beast is the best animated (non-Pixar) Disney movie.  This live-action remake is probably more for a newer audience than myself.  but yo if you reading this disney give us live action black cauldron for real",0,0,SherlockHyde,c38r-SAnTWM,0.23020276292335118,2016-10-11 03:14:51,True,True

Although he had everything his heart desired, the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind. But then, one winter's night, an old beggar-woman came to the castle, and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away. But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away, to reveal a beautiful Enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart. And as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast, and placed a powerful spell on the castle, and all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form, the Beast concealed himself inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his 21st year. If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in return, by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a Beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair, and lost all hope. For who could ever learn to love a beast?""",45,0,Rafferty Keegan-Sharief,c38r-SAnTWM,0.11314285714285716,2016-10-26 22:14:00,True,True

A film about self sacrifice and  the power of forgiveness is exactly what we need after the mess that was  2016. I also hope they put as much effort into the musical score as  they will the CGI because the piano solo's are particularly good and can  be made unforgettable to a whole new generation if scored correctly.

2016-11-04T02:53:23,"Not sure how to feel about this. On the one hand, if you've never watched Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' version, this is a *perfect* way to get into it. :D I can't imagine a better time to reintroduce this cherished classic to the younger generations.  On the other hand, if you've already seen and grew up with this movie, it's basically the same movie, except done with CGI and live actors. It's no different than getting the same car model, but with fancy wipers and new rims this time.  Are we going to get a live-action/CGI movie of the Lion King too? The Little Mermaid?   It's not that I'm not against revisiting old classics - far from it! o_o I enjoy remakes if they strike a nice balance between nostalgia and originality. It's why I enjoy seeing various renditions of Snow White; each film I've seen so far has their own take of that story. However, if Disney is recycling and upgrading old musical scores, same scenes, same narrative, then that takes away from the 'WOW' and originality factor of the original.   Everyone flipped their shit when the ballroom dance first appeared onscreen. We hadn't seen anything done like that before. Beauty and the Beast was one of the first Disney films to explore computer generated imagery.  With this new live-action adaption, I really hope the creative team can come up with something to WOW us; to show us something that hasn't been done before; to really push that CGI to its furthest limits so that THIS movie adaption can stand on its own and be remembered in future generations to come. :)",2,1,RadiusZero,c38r-SAnTWM,0.19658143939393935,2016-11-04 02:53:23,True,True

2017-01-15T19:19:24,"Unfortunately, this is a copy of a faulty fairy tale.  What would be more meaningful and honest would be the actual story.  Of those afflicted with hypertrichosis and the manner in which they were sought out, captured, and enslaved by monarchs.  It is not a fairy tale.  Nor is it a story for young children.  It is one more example of the extreme cruelty of humanity.  Yet, Disney continues to use a reformed evasion of the true horrors of history to profit.  To remake this lie for the purpose of profitability is disgusting.  To ignore the truth is a most grievous crime!Gonsalvus first came to the court of Henry II, King of France in 1547, and was sent from there to the court of Margaret of Parma, regent of the Netherlands. He married while there. Later he was moved into the court of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. Four of his seven children were also afflicted with hypertrichosis universalis and painted.[2]  His family became an object of medical inquiry by Ulisse Aldrovandi  among others. Despite living and acting as a nobleman, Gonsalvus and his  hairy children were not considered fully human in the eyes of their  contemporaries. Gonsalvus eventually settled in Italy with his wife. The  last known record of him is from 1617, when he was listed among those  who had attended his grandson's christening. It is believed that  marriage with Petrus Gonsalvus and lady Catherine inspired the fairy  tale Beauty and the Beast.[3][4] He died in 1618 in Capodimonte.",0,0,Marie Ber,c38r-SAnTWM,0.059210526315789484,2017-01-15 19:19:24,True,True
