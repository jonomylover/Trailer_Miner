2014-11-19T14:06:35,"To all those who will be complaining about another Cinderella film...  You definitely don't know how Hollywood works, do you? It's a big financial gamble if the studios were to invest in something new. If a producer or director were to approach the studios with an original story, then they, along with many other people, are at risk of losing their job. Why do you think a lot of studios are now taking the safe route by spawning out remakes and reboots? They know that people who are familiar with these stories will pay to see it. It's show business. Besides, there have been a large number of original films out there, but they're either unheard of, or they didn't do so well. Quit your complaining and stop falling into the category of a ""whinger"".",1,0,jPod07,20DF6U1HcGQ,0.2136953955135773,2014-11-19 14:06:35,True,True

Yeah, Maleficent was a gigantic misfire but unlike that film, this one actually looks like they're keeping true to the story rather than butchering it for no reason.  I just want to point out that I personally felt Tim Burton's take on Alice in Wonderland was an enjoyable film. Not great but not bad.

Now admittedly the only thing I'm worried about the film is it's writer who previously co-wrote The Nutty Professor 2 and did the screenplay for The Golden Compass. You may now engage shivering with fear.  But this is director Kenneth Branagh for god's sake. He did one of the more well-known adaptations of Hamlet and successfully managed to bring Thor to the big screen properly.  Hopefully he knows what he's doing and maybe this could wipe off the bad taste of Maleficent and restore Disney's dignity.

2014-11-19T17:07:13,"To all those saying ""it should be a new take from the evil stepsister's point of view"" or it should be feminist like 'Malificent'""  Yeah there's a plague of metrosexual libtard, feminist, gullible dupes and disempowered, weak nerds desperate to feel superior and powerful by identifying with evil. They live in their mum's basements and yearn to be a Sith Lord and claim some sort of artistic credibility by only describing their newest fancy by the adjectives 'darker', 'edgier' and the 'good guy loses'. These types fawn over evil but when evil affects them they go crying to mummy and curl up in a foetal position.  Malificent was anti-male, New world order, social engineering propaganda. Pretty transparent to anyone with a brain.Ôªø Here's why: The reason that the globalist elite have been pushing feminism is because men are the biggest threat to their control of the populations. In every takeover or suppression of an enemy throughout history the men were taken out first. Men are more likely to view totalitarian authority as an alpha male threat whereas women are more likely to view it as a protector (related to women liking the 'bad boys'). Men are thus more likely to challenge authority and are physically more dangerous.  Globalist inspired feminism is also about societal divide and conquer. They need to destroy the social fabric to make it harder for familial relationships to form particularly between men and women as families provide cohesion and resistance against tyranny. So pushing women to abandon traditional nurturing female traits and to pursue male qualities creates friction as men have evolved to protect and compliment women not compete with them. Relationships have become harder to form between men and women, divorce is at an all time high, marriage at an all time low as women abandon their biological natures in favour of pursuing masculine traits, ending up with internal conflict and they are often unhappy.  At the heart of feminism lies deception. Feminism was created by the power elite as a communist tool (modelled off Stalinesque Russian female empowerment techniques) to make society more divided, more matriarchal and thus more controllable.",3,0,Indra Blade,20DF6U1HcGQ,-0.019168212739641335,2014-11-19 17:07:13,True,True

First, though we don't know for sure if they met before the events of the movie. Cinderella and the Prince didn't meet. But that's me being nit picky. Second. The horse drove the carriage not a duck. I didn't event notice Bruno (the dog) Fourth. The mice don't talk. She may not have spoken to them a lot in the movie but at least she could understand them. And another nit-picky thing. Her dress isn't right.  If this is what Disney is going to do, future generations are going to grow up not knowing good Disney movies.

Not a re-make, but a re-telling (though I admit, they do use the same names for the step-family and the general designs to a degree, such as Drizella's weird bow on her head).

2014-11-20T04:48:39,Out of all the disney princess movies they had to pick Cinderella. Maleficent was amazing because it showed another side to the story. The Cinderella story has been told time and time again. I think Cinderella is one of the most bland stories. They could have chosen Aladin or The Princess And The Frog or something more diverse. Aurora was a blonde haired blue eyed princess maybe take a break from that for a movie or two and show diverse princesses for little girls to look up to instead of the kind nice blonde haired blue eyed angel little princess. I would love to see a real life remake of The Princess and the Frog but sadly there are a lot of other white princess stories that will be remade before I see that.¬†,4,0,Zambie,20DF6U1HcGQ,0.13725490196078435,2014-11-20 04:48:39,True,True

2014-11-20T05:19:54,"""Cinderella"": In the Brothers Grimm version, one of Cinderella's evil stepsisters cuts off her toes, and the other her heel so they can both fit into the tiny glass slipper. The prince is notified by little doves that there is blood on the shoe, and finally discovers that the true owner is Cinderella. Once the stepsisters realize that they should try to win favor with Cinderella (after all, she will be queen), they attend her wedding, only to have their eyes pecked out by birds  SOME OTHER SIDENOTES ON THIS STORY: Cinderella doesn't have a fairy godmother. Rather, she plants a tree by her mother's grave and prays under it every day. She finds her dresses to wear to each ball under the tree (there are three in the story, not one like in the movie). She is still helped by animals, though specifically birds, not mice. Also, she doesn't just lose her shoe because she is in a rush. The clever prince covers the steps in pitch to make her stick to them, but she only loses a shoe in the process.",32,12,viktor star,20DF6U1HcGQ,-0.0016025641025641012,2014-11-20 05:19:54,True,True

It's not going to make much of a difference whether the cast is all Caucasian, African, Latino, Asian, Native American, Hawaiian, Russian, or Indian (you can add more to the list if you'd like); the only thing that's going to be effected is the setting. Disney chose to recreate the European version of Cinderella, so having a 95% Caucasian cast is to be expected. And before anyone says it, I am fully aware that Europe is not all Caucasian, but it is mostly Caucasian.

His skin is fine, just clean it and moisturize. If the lenses and lighting are good, he's going to look good. With 35mm and panavision cine glass, you're going to see the makeup and then if you try to blend it in post, you've created a bunch of work that never needed to be done and ended up making a really plastic looking image from $30,000 lenses.

I just think Cinderella gets such a bad rap! The concept in valuing truth, patience, kindness and forgiveness above all, even in the face of abuse and bullying is REALLY powerful. It's so much easier to be like ""here, kill the bad guy."" But let's face it, that never happens in real life. This is a much more challenging, yet rewarding message. And as for the fancy gown at the ball- the point is, since this is the Perrault (not German) version of the fairytale, she gets rewarded with the gown from the fairy godmother and with help from the animals, because she is a good person! She gets rewarded with luxury and extravagance, for once, at the ball, because it is supposed to reflect her internal beauty.

The plot being the same as the old and classic Disney version was actually what I liked the most about this new one. Yes, we do want to see those stories that have been part of our childhood, magically created in real life with beautiful characters. Disney classic fairy tails are perfect the way they are and because we are so used to them since we were little kids, we consider them as the main version or the 'true' version (even though they aren't). Therefore, the only way to make it 'better' is by using innovative cinematic techniques, NOT by changing or adding new unrelated elements to the story. I actually find it disappointed when they recreate old movies and introduce a whole lot of things just to make it different or ""unseen"". It's as if they were trying to change our childhood memories and the only thing that goes through my mind is: ""No... that's not right! That's not what happened in the story... They're wrong"". It's the same kind of disappointment when we watch a movie based on a book we already read, because the images of our imagination are already in our heads (or in this case, images of our memories) and when people show it in a complete different way is kinda upsetting. Maleficent was different though, because they didn't tell us the same story in a complete different way. They introduced us a background (the truth underlying the classic story) and that's what made it different & good at the same time. Also, another thing that I found remarkably good in Cinderella is the casting chosen, especially Lily James. To play the main character you gotta know how to act as a real-princess (I'm using hyphen here because I'm not saying 'real' as in a ""true princess"", but as in a princess closer to reality). Well.. to explain it better, we don't live in Monarchies anymore so princesses are not part of our daily lives. Therefore, to represent something unreal (a princess) as real as possible, Lily James used nothing else than emotions - universal feelings !! - something we all can relate to :) She didn't have blank faces or fake crystallized tears like Mia Wasikowska in Alice in Wonderland or Elle Fanning in Maleficent. You can easily see her emotions only through her facial expressions, like her reaction when Lady Tremaine tells her to call her Madam, when she meets the prince (in this particularly scene she reminded me of Kate Winslet playing Rose in Titanic by the way *-*), her look of surprise when she touches the white horse, or even before that, when the fairy godmother appears it's possible to see her red face and swallow eyes because she was crying. PLUS she did all that still having the adorable, sweet, gentle and beautiful looks of a true princess. So in summary, Lily James easily portrayed Cinderella as a princess but simultaneously as a real person. I won't even talk about the prince (Richard Madden) but for now, all I'm gonna say is that when he said: ""Believe me they are all looking at you"" WOW! My heart melted. hahaha. In conclusion, I absolutely loved the fact that it followed the original one. I even loved how the colors of her dresses are the same from the old version and how she also uses a cloth on her hair as a maid. I loved all the similarities and even the small differences. And I loved how the dearest Disney princess was portrayed by the gorgeous Lily James :) I'm sooooooo looking forward to watching this movie <3¬†  Note: this is MY opinion, based on the trailer only ;) ¬†",0,0,g.,20DF6U1HcGQ,0.21074351893317403,2014-11-20 11:21:02,True,True

It's surprisingly close to the original Cinderella (well, the cartoon one, at least), and the cast is new and refreshing as they are not all uber famous actors. Some people are complaining about the lack of racial diversity, but I am a woman of color myself, and I find no problem with it in this movie at least. It's historically accurate (I'm actually glad there aren't tons of black people in this movie. As accurate as Disney likes to be, they all would have had to be depicted as slaves or servants, and as horrible as that is, it's what people of color would have been in that era. I think we can all agree that has no place in this movie. Besides, it's a fairytale. Your kid doesn't give a shit what color skin the princess has, as long as she-or he- gets to wear a tiara just like hers). Just as movies like Mulan, Princess and the Frog, Aladdin, and Frozen were, the peoples' races are just as they would have been in that country and time period. That's some ace research and historical representation on Disney's part if I may say so. The only person who could have been more racially diverse is the Fairy Godmother, and that's my only complaint. She should have been something other than white, as she's a fairy, not a born and bred European. That was a wasted chance, imo. Otherwise though, I'm excited to see this! It looks really well-done, and I hope it turns out as awesome as it's presented to be! Though I must agree they showed WAY too much in this trailer... -__- ¬†And if you REALLY desire a racially diverse version of Cinderella, go watch Roger and Hammerstein's rendition of Cinderella.

2014-11-20T12:56:34,"i am a black girl, and in all honesty i cant see cinderella being black. Why? because of the historical inaccuracy. This story i'm guessing is set in england i presume, maybe during slavery, i'm not sure. How would that work? Cinderella's father would have had to be a rich black man, which i'm not sure was possible, before he left or died ( i'm not sure which style they're going to use) and probs married a black stepmother. Fine. What about the prince though, I doubt they can use a caucasian male to dance with the african female, and then marry her in the end. If they did, then the whole movie might be about the father not wanting an african princess, or the country not accepting her.Thus, its not even cinderella at all. It's another story entirely. Maybe if they changed the whole dynamic and made it a dystopian society then maybe it would work. But until that happens, let the european stories remain how they were written. Instead, let's make our own fairytales. Keep it in mind, these were stories written a while ago to adhere to society during those times.

Secondly, there were people of non-European, non-white descent in Europe in the early modern period (and in other periods too). This was particularly the case at court where having a black or brown servant was desirable.

For starters this is not a musical everyone like the animated version so you won't be hearing A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes , Bibbidi Bobidi Boo etc. Jaq and Gus won't be in this or wear clothes like in the original , so ever since I heard that Disney was doing this I was dissapointed because people are going to confuse it with the animated one. Also notice that they are all British in the Walt Disney animated one they all had American accents , also the stepmother here has red hair in the animated one she had grey hair , yes her name is Lady Treamine like in the cartoon, yes Anastasia and Drizella are the names of the stepsisters etc. yes Cinderella is blonde and has a blue dress , but don't let Disney fool you all guys this is not a direct REMAKE OF THE CARTOON ONE WE ALL KNOW ITS NOT A MUSICAL ETC. Stupid director Kenneth Branagh wanting to name it this Cinderella , they should have called it Ella to not get people confused !!!! with the original cartoon one.¬†",0,0,Fernphone.,20DF6U1HcGQ,-0.0784375,2014-11-20 20:00:16,True,True

2014-11-20T21:59:04,"Oh for goodness sakes, it is a FAIRY-TALE, it is MAKE BELIEVE! And yes, back then, in those times of which they are set and the first published story of Cinderella was in 1634 where woman depending on men was something that ACTUALLY happened and even then if you go back further the story seemed to originate in Ancient Greek times which, once again, woman stayed at home, dependent on what the husband can earn and she cooked and cleaned. So yes, woman are dependent on men in these stories and now times have changed but given Anderson and Grimm (most well known) wrote these stories in the 17 or 1800's or whatever it is woman were STILL dependent on men then as well so the men wrote from what they knew and in those times woman didn't have jobs, went out, had meals at fancy restaurants by themselves etc because it would of been wrong for a woman to exercise her independence.  So yes we have moves based on the ORIGINAL works because if you have seen the modern fairy tales that have been made they are all crap, as long as you teach the little girls that they can be independent on their own then let them have the fantasy of finding a prince and living a non stressful life because as soon as they grow up they realize they won't be having that and they need to make it on their own. I¬†grew up with these stories and as a 31 year old woman I didn't throw a tantrum because I didn't get my prince and castle, these stories never scarred me so let the little girls have their fantasies, it is HEALTHY for them to pretend they may get a prince, it is called having an imagination and besides, one or two MIGHT get a prince, look at Kate, I doubt she grew up thinking 'oh one day I am going to marry William!' when she was 12+ (age to more or less start to let go of these fantasies and realizing that, ya know, princes are not for everyone) for her, she was just lucky that she actually WAS able to nab herself a prince.",4,0,TheLostLenore,20DF6U1HcGQ,0.11215277777777777,2014-11-20 21:59:04,True,True

No. I realise that it may come across as that but I highly doubt that's the case. I've seen the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical version of Cinderella with a Black Cinderella, a white step family, the prince is Asian and the queen is black and king is white yet it today still remains one of my FAVOURITE films. The race does not make a film. The acting does. You could have a mixed race cast but if the acting isn't good it's not going to be a good film. The same goes for an all white cast, if the acting is rubbish then likely the films not going to be much better. ¬†For all we know the actors or actresses could be mixed race but still look white. I realise that racism is a major issue and I think it's awful but not everything is an attack on race.I get peoples point about this being story of Northern European origins and at the time that it was written, the idea of a black or any other race person being wealthy or being of high standing was not realistic and I still find it appalling how anyone of a different race was treated but it was reality though it does not make it right. Does this mean that a new take can't be done? No. This is a traditional take on the story and casting and so I think people need to understand that.¬†If there was racism going on behind the casting choice (not casting another race because of personal prejudice) then that's a real shame.

On a side note, if you're going to make your characters blonde (which is adhering to the traditional cinderella so that's fine) and you're not going to cast actresses that are naturally blonde (again, fine if you're looking for acting talent rather than model cast and hope for the best), you at least need to talk to your make up department and make sure that their eyebrows match their hair.

Maleficent wasn't particularly well made, but it had elements to draw you in; it had Angelina Jolie looking exactly like the classic villain, it had a gritty origin story that completely re-wrote the tale and gave new dimension to the character, and it had a great twist ending that made it all worth it despite the flaws. I want to hold out hope that MAYBE the ""kindness"" thing they keep repeating is going to have a similar angle, like maybe the stepmother and stepsisters are secretly jealous of Cindy because they thought her dad loved her and her mom more but Cindy's unwavering kindness will turn them around at the end and they'll be like a real family or something, but that's definitely not the vibe I'm getting from the trailer. I'm also not a fan of the costuming, Cindy's dress looks nothing like the original and it doesn't look period appropriate either and Lady Tremaine also doesn't appear to look or act anything like the classic villain, and between her and the fairy godmother looking way too fabulous and not at all like the original middle-aged matriarchs it feels like the movie is going to be all style and no substance.

2014-11-22T15:22:51,"Okay I have heard enough of the ""why are there mostly white people in this"".¬† Guess what? It is because the film is based of a story, written and set by Europeans, at a time in Europe where it was mostly white people.¬†Please read through my comment and you might understand why that is actually a very valid argument and why it actually promotes diversity. First of all, I am not even white, but I have to point out that trying to force PoC in this is a form of cultural appropriation. Believe me, I hate white supremacists more than any group of people, and due to bad experiences, I have a certain disliking to white people in general, but to me, blacks or asians trying to get in on Classical European literature works, is a form of them submitting to white supremacy, that white culture is superior then there own culture. I stand for diversity, and a form of multiculturalism very few understand. To me, I would rather see 5 disney movies, with each movie being an adaptation of a literary classical or folklore story that belongs to a certain culture, with all the characters being cast of that ethnicity, not see 5 movies with all races mixed together. I would rather see an Arabian Nights adaptation, with an all-Arab or Persian cast, and a Chinese folklore adaptation with an all Chinese cast, and an Indian legend adaptation with an all Indian/Pakistani cast, and a African folklore adaptation with an all Black cast, and a Western-European classic adaptation with an all white cast. When keeping all these different stories to their own ethnic casts, you are actually preserving each and every culture's heritage. When you mix the cast for adaptations of each of these stories, you are destroying them. I would be equally pissed to see a white guy in Mulan or Aladdin, as I would be to see a black person in Cinderella.",1,0,Radu Bey,20DF6U1HcGQ,0.04333914053426249,2014-11-22 15:22:51,True,True

The saddest part is that they themselves don't even realize they simultaneously profess contradictory thoughts.    That being said, let me as some questions, so I may better understand your arguments.      Is it that the movie studio would not hire an individual of African heritage (easier to just say black...even though all Homo sapiens evolved into our present form on the African continent over several million years and only hundred fifty thousand years ago did we begin migrate to other continents.  I say this because me are much more alike than we are similar.  With a little genetic research you will find the hidden secret of racism they hide...THERE IS NOT BIOLOGICAL Foundation for RACE.  Human races are not natural genetic groups; they are socially constructed categories.  I've just glossed over a very complicated yet well documented SCIENTIFIC FACT so don't consider this a complete defense.  Now I'm getting back to my questions after a very long parentheses!)      Was it the director who choose not to cast a black ( feels so weird using that word) or was it the writers?  Or are you claiming that society has unconsciously (or ON PURPOSE) fostered and cultivated an atmosphere wherein black characters are segregated to all black movies?  My point us obvious...WHO OR WHOM DO YOU BELIEVE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LACK OF MINORITY INCLUSION in archetypal character roles traced back to European fables?

My problem with this new film is that, at least in the trailer, save for the preemptive meeting with the prince on horseback and the flashback scenes with the mother, all of the scenes are from Disney's cartoon. ¬†It's just a live action version of something they've already done over half a century ago. ¬†I suppose the story of Cinderella has been twisted just as often as Snow White, and the fairy tale universe itself (i.e., Once Upon A Time, Fables/The Wolf Among Us, The 10th Kingdom, Into the Woods, etc.), but do we ever really get tired of it? ¬†I hope this version will have some sort of little twist at the end. ¬†Just her managing to get out of the locked room by herself would be enough for me, instead of having to rely on friendly rodents. ¬†Really, who would pay to go to a theater, only to watch something they've seen before? ¬†Well, it's Cinderella, so a lot of people will, but I think I'll just stay home that day and watch the original instead while waiting for this to hit Redbox or NetFlix, at least until I hear something about this version that makes me believe it's worth the expense.",0,0,ichigoeater,20DF6U1HcGQ,0.08970454545454548,2014-12-03 11:54:18,True,True

2014-12-07T02:45:17,"The people who complain that this is an all white cast unknowingly generate racism because their complaints beg the point - what is stopping black people from creating their own stories and characters? Nobody is stopping them. At the end of the day black people are a minority in the US, it only stands to reason that they wouldn't make up an equal proportion of the cast. While the film is a fantasy, it is loosely set in an age and place which was almost solely compromised of white people. The fact it's a fantasy means they don't need to be strict with that representation, but does it actually matter? Seems like an asinine thing to have a teary about. Would you have preferred the director to have been forced to cast a black cinderella, even if it was against his vision as an artist?  Don't take me the wrong way. I would be happy if it was an all black cast and would have about the same level of interest in the film (see: none. I'm male.), I just don't see why racial representation matters. I don't think black people are demeaned simply because they aren't included, nor do I believe they would suddenly be empowered for being represented.  If you worry about the skin colours of characters in a fantasy film, I'd suggest you have it pretty easy in life. People with genuine struggles don't fret over such things.

2014-12-09T00:16:51,"As a lifelong Disney fan ever since I was a little kid, all I can say after seeing this first real trailer of Disney's newest live-action remake of another of their animated classics is simply wow :)  The Jungle Book, Alice in Wonderland & Maleficent were all fantastic live-action remakes of Disney animated masterpieces but Cinderella definitely looks to be totally way more faithful to the spirit, essence & the original story of its beloved animated predecessor than the former 3. It really appears as if the phenomenally-gifted Kenneth Branagh has found the always-rare to find perfect balance of staying true to the original while adding new fresh bits & pieces here & there to make this familiar tale feel brand new. Plus the cast he's assembled is just hands down 100% top notch: Downton Abbey co-stars Lily James (Lady Rose) & Sophie McShera (Daisy) as Cinderella & Drizella respectively, Game of Thrones' Richard Madden (The late great Robb Stark) as Prince Charming, Cate Blanchett as The Wicked Stepmother, Helena Bonham Carter as The Fairy Godmother, Sir Derek Jacobi (Gladiator) as The King, Stellan Skarsgard (Thor 1 & 2) as The Grand Duke, Hayley Atwell (The First Avenger: Captain America) as Cinderella's mother & Holiday Grainger (Great Expectations) as Anastasia and as always Kenneth is once again bringing along his go-to composer, the equally-phenomenal Patrick Doyle to score the film. I mean wow :)  The only 2 things that slightly bother me a bit is (1). Hayley as a blonde. Hayley as a blonde is nowhere near as beautiful & attractive as she truly is with her natural brunette hair. They shouldn't have had her dye her beautiful brown hair cause she's way more dreamy as a brunette than as a blonde!!! & (2). I was really hoping that just like in the 2 direct to DVD sequels to the original animated classic that Holiday's Anastasia would be portrayed as a more sympathetic stepsister to Cinderella compared to full-out nasty Drizella & their vicious mother. Anastasia's character evolution from wicked stepsister to misunderstood & surprisingly likable new version of herself as seen in the aforementioned D2DVD sequels was the only thing I loved about those 2 movies!!! Just like in the wonderful Ever After: A Cinderella Story, it was totally refreshing to see at least 1 of Cinderella's stepsisters geniunely care about her like a true sister should so it's a shame that Branagh has seemingly opted to portray Anastasia in her old original full-wicked self. Ah well :(  Aside from those 2 minor hiccups, I simply cannot wait to finally see this next year!!!

Maleficent were Sleeping Beauty- from Grimm's Fairy tales' Briar Rose. And there were actually 12 faeries, one of them was 'Maleficent'. The princess' name wasn't Aurora, but Briar Rose instead.   Cinderella- came from Grimm's Fairy Tales too, though it has different versions from different European countries. The 'Cinderella"" name has many translations too and Grimm's version was quite dark and exaggerated where birds pecked the eyes(of course there's blood) of Cinderella's stepsisters during her wedding and they both died.  Beauty and The Beast I think is the BEST. Both in literature and in movies. I like how ""true love conquers everything"" concept brought to life in a very romantic way, perhaps it is TRUE LOVE, after all... Imagine a pretty young lady falling in love with a cruel beast?  It was a story about not judging others based on what you see-  Belle looked at the cruel beast's kind side instead of looking at his grotesque physical features and ugliness.   It was a story about bravery- how Belle or Beauty sacrificed herself to the beast, in replacement for her father's imprisonment and even death. Belle wasn't afraid of the beast too.  It was a story about hope- the beast fell into despair but didn't give up his hope from finding someone to love despite his ugly physical appearance, thanks to his castle attendees and butlers.  It was a story about learning your own lesson- the beast was once a handsome prince, but fell into a spell after the enchantress cursed him for being such a rude, disrespectful, cruel, judgemental, unkind and selfish person. But he changed himself for the sake of good. And he learned all the good traits that he lack from Belle.   And, it was a story about Love- Beast almost gave up his life to save Belle from the wolves(in the movie), he also set Belle free from imprisonment because he knows where Belle can find true happiness even though he loves her and knows that she was the key to break the spell. Belle, loved him back despite his ugliness, because she found love in his heart.

Having said all that about Carter, I do have to admit that this movie looks pretty impressive.

It is often considered the oldest known version of the story:  They tell the fabulous story that, when she was bathing, an eagle snatched one of her sandals from her maid and carried it to Memphis; and while the king was administering justice in the open air, the eagle, when it arrived above his head, flung the sandal into his lap; and the king, stirred both by the beautiful shape of the sandal and by the strangeness of the occurrence, sent men in all directions into the country in quest of the woman who wore the sandal; and when she was found in the city of Naucratis, she was brought up to Memphis, became the wife of the king ...",0,0,Sa√Ød,20DF6U1HcGQ,0.17857142857142858,2015-01-10 22:22:24,True,True

I think Cinderella is a classic, timeless story and why should modernized views change that? Yes, it doesn't have a diverse cast - but other movies do. Look at Big Hero 6 for example. Plenty of viewers complained about the lack of diversity so they changed an originally all Asian cast to white, black, etc. yet the movie was criticized for cheap attempts at making the movie diverse. And yes most Cinderella adaptations always have the same endings yet, how would you feel if they suddenly decided to change the amazing plot line you grew up with? I'm glad they're making a live action version, yes I know what's going to happen but I feel like live action just brings it so much more to life.

So no, it actually is not a ""European fairy-tale.""  2.)

2015-03-15T00:29:26,"SPOILERS AHEAD: So this movie, I felt did an okay job, but I still enjoyed the original cartoon version. I like the fact that they showed what happened to the mother, which is something that they didn't show in the original. The message was better stated here and the graphics were pretty great. Also, it had a nice twist with the stepmother breaking her glass slipper. But some of the main points weren't well presented in this film. The death of the father was sudden and it was thought that he was killed by the stepmother in the original, unlike the new one where he had an accident. Cinderella was a servant basically for eight years in the original, which makes her kindness more extraordinary as she had the patience with dealing her step family, even when she had to do so many chores without help and even several times if a minor mistake was made. This one, however, she was the only servant for less than a year, half of which she had help from the other servants. So she didn't really feel the abuse for a long period of time. The animals in this one were alive for an unusual amount of time because the average lifespan of a mouse is only 2 years, and these mice have been with Cinderella since she was 8 (so about 8 years). Also, Cinderella is her name, not a nick name. For her to take the name given to her by her stepsisters instead by her parents is kind of an insult. Sure you can say that it serves as a constant reminder of her abuse, but again, that wasn't for long period of time. Had she been enslaved at age 8, like the original one, I will accept it, but less than a year isn't long enough. Also, the fairy god mother was more like a hot sister than a gentle mother. They should have casted someone like Betty White or Judi Dench to give that lovely persona. Also, the tearing of the dress wasn't as saddening as the original. The stepmother tore the sleeve and the front part, which was pretty sad, but not as sad as the original when the sisters tore it up so much, and when the mother just smiled and left her there without so much as a forbidding Cinderella from going to the ball.¬†",0,0,Erik Palomera,20DF6U1HcGQ,0.18698752228163987,2015-03-15 00:29:26,False,True

The settings, the clothes and all the other little details were absolutely picturesque.  The acting was brilliant - I even teared up at some parts.  And the lesson of the entire story wasn't overdone to the point of being cheesy, but emphasized enough that I left the theater feeling so good about the world and wanting to ""have courage and be kind.""  And sure, the argument could be made that the movie is still a silly fairy tale teaching young girls that women need men or it's good to be a pushover or whatever else people are coming up with these days, but I really don't think every movie needs to feature some rebellious, ""badass,"" ""strong and independent"" girl who absolutely refuses to be married or believe in anything beyond the confines of her own eyes.

There were black nobleman during the 12th and 13th century in Europe. They were respected and seen as anyone else. They were guests of kings and queens due to their nobleman status. They weren't different. Their dark skin was just seen as another human feature. Also, skeletal remains of a high society black male were found in the rumble of the Mount Vesuvius eruption which destroyed Pompeii, Greece in 79 AD. There are many many examples of people of Hispanic, African, and Asian heritage in European society and vice versa (Europeans in other culture's society). It's ridiculous how we are today. There's not white, black, mexican (which, if they weren't born in Mexico or have heritage from Mexico, can you please stop calling a person Mexican), or Chinese (same applies here). We are all an amazing mix of culture and heritage. Love yourself and love others as Jesus loves you.

2015-04-16T06:41:38,"I read something very interesting on tumblr the other day, which has made me much more excited to see this movie. A lady was commenting on how most people see Cinderella as such a passive, non feminist story, because the girl hardly has any power and doesn't stand up to her stepfamily. But, this lady said, the story is actually very empowering in that Ella never once is cruel or vindictive or selfish, despite the horrible abuse she faces in her own home. The empowerment comes from Ella being able to stay good and pure of heart despite her hardships, and if u think she should have stood up against her abusers, you've obviously never heard a victim or survivor talk about how hard it is to defend yourself against it. It can be dangerous, even lethal, to try and leave your abusers home, and in that time period? Forget about it. So no, she doesn't fight, but yes, she is a good role model in that she endures and hopes and stays kind and generous despite others being so unkind to her. She is breaking the cycle of abuse--and that is a very powerful, incredible thing to happen in a story like this. As Ellas mum says, where there is kindness, there is goodness. And where there us goodness, there is magic.",1,0,R Kaiser,20DF6U1HcGQ,0.14358134920634918,2015-04-16 06:41:38,False,True

Yea Helena had a small role but its perfect because if given more she would have distracted from the full film plus in the animated version the role is the same. Im so glad they didn't make any huge changes like the last two films where snow white becomes a joan of arc type or in maleficent where they make the evil villain a not so evil person. The only thing i wish i could change about this movie (and yet i wouldn't because they did it beautifully well) was when the step mother was explaining why she treated Cinderella as she did she kind of stopped mid sentence and stormed off in anger which left me wanting more :))) Such a teese,1,0,captainbrunch,20DF6U1HcGQ,0.109375,2015-04-23 19:51:33,False,True

I think the strong actors really made you actually care when I was expecting it to be very shallow and too cartoonish to really take seriously. I know Cate gets all the big camp moments with the villain but I actually think its Lily James who carries the movie overall. She strikes the perfect balance between nice and charming but also feisty and strong; this bitch really knows who she is and will not let anybody spoil her day or wipe that optimistic smile off her face. She will not cry over being treated like shit by her step family or ever be a doormat to any man. Nor will she wait for some white knight to come get her; she was determined to go to that fucking ball and get that dick. Way ahead of her time. I believed in the chemistry between the two lovers. I also thought the King & princes relationship was touching especially the deathbed scene where the prince was curled up on the bed like a little boy. It had some very human moments. Again, it goes back to the actors playing it for real; Derek jacobi has such a strong presence as the king & both he and Cate gave the film strong theatrical credibility. But its Lilys film.

I think if Disney really want to brain wash kids or whoever else still buys into this kind of crap nowadays that they should marry for love, then at least create a story that's more realistic for god sake. Like instead of letting Cinderella marry Prince Charming, they should let her marry a fatass butcher or servant. Moreover, instead of letting Prince Charming marry a hot bombshell, they should let him marry an ugly 200 pound girl.

But since you CAN balance small stones one on top of another anywhere on Earth, Earth cannot possibly be a spinning oblate spheroid. Besides, if the earth's supposed centrifugal force can be perfectly cancelled out by ""gravity"" at the equator, then you should feel ""gravity"" twice as strongly at the North Pole since there is no centrifugal force there. Do we? Nope. Earth isn't spinning. Gravity has NEVER been scientifically proven whereas density/buoyancy have been. The Propensity Of Density > The Depravity Of Gravity.

This is the only one that improves on the original cartoon movie. The BatB and Aladdin had terrible singing (auto-tuned Belle, anyone?) and low-energy musical scenes (everything in Aladdin) and pointless changes to the story (Jasmine's whole character, filler CGI chase scene with mutant Iago) and needless addition of modern politics (Belle's feminism). I love that this Cinderella celebrates traditional femininity, kindness and forgiveness.

Cinderella always stayed kind and hopeful despite all of the abuse she endured, she even forgave her abusers and that is truly something not everyone can do. She never wanted to be saved by a prince, in fact she didn‚Äôt go to the ball for him, she didn‚Äôt even know what he looks like! She went there to escape from her daily dreadful life and have at least one night where she could forget about her pain. I really don‚Äôt like people who claim that Cinderella wasn‚Äôt strong and depended on a man. It was never the case, and to the people who still think this way I hope you‚Äôll see that a strong woman is not only the one that can fight and doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave a man‚Äù. Cinderella is in love with a man who accepted her for who she really was and is strong and powerful.
