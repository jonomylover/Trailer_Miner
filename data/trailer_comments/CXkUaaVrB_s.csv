2018-08-12T15:52:50,"I saw The Spy Who Dumped Me this weekend. I also saw The Meg and saw this one as my second choice. I wasn‚Äôt too thrilled to see it but I only go if there‚Äôs at least 2 new movies I want to see a lot or appear like I can tolerate seeing. Anyways, I didn‚Äôt have high expectations going in because I thought the previews were just ok and the name of the movie didn‚Äôt catch my eye at first. I get like that with movie previews sometimes where I‚Äôm like I don‚Äôt know about this one even if the movie has some of my favorite actors. I was pleasantly surprised!!! I LOVED this movie. It was very funny, action packed, and the actors had great chemistry. There were some twists I didn‚Äôt expect which was nice that it wasn‚Äôt too predictable. I see the movie had made about 13 million before some of this weekends earnings came in and now its gone up to almost 25 million of a 40 million budget. I hope it makes all of its money back and then some. People should give it a chance! I thought it was going to be cringe bad based on the previews but was surprised like I was with Ocean‚Äôs 8. I thought that one was going to be silly but enjoyed it. The Spy Who Dumped Me is one of my favorite comedies and female led action movies of the year. I would actually watch it again multiple times.

And the COMEDY? THE COMEDY? WOW! Between the vagina jokes, the screaming in every other scene and the drawn out parts with absolutely no weight or value to the plot or character just to put in the flattest lines they could find (such as ""I smoked so much meth before"", absolutely the most Austrian and funny thing they could have said there), I'm flabbergasted how this got anything above a 5 on IMDB, but maybe that's the joke? Shame Lionsgate, you used to publish better written movies than this half-assed script. If I had watched this movie in theaters, I would have left half-way through and demanded my money back, too bad I didn't because all I have now is a wasted 2hrs that I can't get back at all. if a combination of all spy movies with absolutely no originality added to it is a good movie, then this is a masterpiece.  unoriginal, predictable, lazy. 2/8 would not recommend to watch.",0,0,Speedow,CXkUaaVrB_s,0.0014446924603174621,2018-10-20 03:17:37,False,True

There is one beautiful moment in the movie, approx. between 19:00 and 21:00, when Audrey and Morgan drive in a car and talk about any safe place for hiding from the persuit. After Sebastian's call Morgan asks Audrey:""You trust me there, alright?"" Audrey:""Yes, of course, I trust you. You don't count."" Morgan:""Ok, good, because this is not some fake spy friendship that the russians put together"". This phrase was about killing Drew by another agent (or some kind of bandit, who has awful acsent in russian language ""Do svidania, Drew"", like he has a hot potato in his mouth), who introdused himself in bar earlier as a guy from Ukraine. So, my question is: why did Morgan mentioned ""fake spy friendship between russian spies"" instead of ""fake spy friendship between ukrainian spies""? I will suppose the second reason for this: Mila Kunis was born in Ukraine and the scenario was also adopted for her participation.
