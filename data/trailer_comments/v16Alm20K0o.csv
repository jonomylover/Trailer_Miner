2017-01-17T20:16:22,"There seem to be a lot of Christians in this comment section (hardly a surprise), so hopefully one of you can explain something to me. The problem of Hell (why would an all-loving god send people to Hell) is something that comes up quite a bit when discussing Christianity, and most Christians give basically the same response: God is just, so he cannot allow sinners into Heaven without a redeemer. My question is, how does this ""redeemer"" idea make any sense? Imagine, for a moment, that there is a convicted serial killer facing a judge in a courtroom... The serial killer tells the judge, ""Hey, you seem like a nice guy, you should just let me go without any punishment."" The judge replies, ""I can't just let you go. You're a serial killer. It would be unjust to let you free without punishment."" The serial killer then says, ""Well, I have a friend here. This friend of mine has never done anything wrong in his entire life, and he's agreed to take my punishment on my behalf if you let me go."" The judge replies, ""Oh, in that case, you're free to go. Allowing a killer like yourself to go without punishment would be unjust, but punishing an innocent person and *then* letting the killer go without punishment is perfectly just.""  In that scenario, the judge seems like he's out of his mind. Surely punishing an innocent person and then letting a killer go free would be *less* just than simply letting the killer go free. So why is it that, to Christians, the story of Jesus doesn't sound equally ridiculous?

Evangelical Christianity is predominantly one of the most paradoxically named cultures in the west. Those who claim to be one seem to (generally) have some of the worst understanding of the life and message of Jesus, let alone humanity at large.  *And I truly only intend these comments as observations, not criticisms.  Jesus was the friend to all of humanity. He had no ""side"" other than life, love, self sacrifice, hope, forgiveness, and a true pursuit of justice and religion.  The fact that any Christian in the west feels like he or she can't stand comfortably beside a person of any other belief system—including the ""oh so dangerous"" atheism—shows that the message of Christ has become diluted and lost within the practice of politics and false religion.  And furthermore, everyone's human here. No one absolutely knows anything nor absolutely doesn't question anything. And that needs to be ok.  Peace all. Just my little rant / 2 cents.

2017-04-25T09:34:21,Doubters please consider  When you look at the world around you and how complex the human body is and how it maintains its self daily can a person really say that it all happened by chance?  The brain is also very complex how did that happen by chance?  And thats just the physical shell and the world as an example.  How about the consciousness you have where did that come from?  I also think about when a man and woman make love and that simple substances that coincide with other complex  processes to form a baby.  This is also too complex to just happen by chance.  DNA in the human body comes to mind but im not knowledgeable on that topic but I get the impression that if a non believer researched that topic as well they would find compelling information.,2,0,Sean S,v16Alm20K0o,-0.03192307692307692,2017-04-25 09:34:21,False,True
