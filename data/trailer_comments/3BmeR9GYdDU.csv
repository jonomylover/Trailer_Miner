So unless you are over the age of 57. you weren't even born when this film was made. Film buffs have probably all seen the movie given it being a classic film and really a great example of film-making overall.   Hollywood is more than allowed to make another movie about a novel from the late 1800's that hasn't been touched for over 50 years.   We get seemingly a half-dozen films a year based on some Young Adult Fiction series and they are all almost carbon-copies of each other from a story perspective. Adjust the setting and some minor tweaks here and there and you've got yourself a new series.  We've had countless movies about bible stories, including movies solely about Jesus. Dozens of films about famous Greek/Roman tragedies. Multiple versions of Shakespeare's works. They are all stories that are retold because of how well known they are and that they can still relate to us even today.

I mean, the John Carpenter ""Thing"" was a remake, Dracula has been done a handleful of times and Gatsby....what...3? 4 times? All of those for the most part have been fairly well received. The trend seems to be the sooner it is remade after the one before, the more criticism it receives. Nah, this is alright, I'd like to see what they do to the story for a modern audience.

At the very least the chariot scene needs to be practical, because if a 1957 movie looks better than your 2016 version then you did something wrong.  This isn't going to hold up, which brings up the question why not just re-release the 1957 version, in 3D I don't care, that would allow young people to see it, the right way, as well as bring in the ticket sales you so desperately seem to need. Seeing an epic like Ben-Hur on the big screen is a bloody privilege.   Why? The big question for this movies existence. If you are remaking a movie that is perfect or near-so, then you either need to do something completely different, a new interpretation if you will, like Magnificent Seven, or as previously mentioned re-release the original. But to have the nerve to do whatever hell this interpretation of Ben-Hur is, would be  on the same level as straight up remaking 12 Angry Men, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly or Lawrence of Arabia.

That is what they care about.  Secondly - Trailers can be incredibly misleading in terms of a movies tone. Just look how different the two Suicide Squad trailers are for an example of that. Thirdly - Remakes allow a story to be introduced to a new generation. Whether the film is good or not ultimately doesn't matter as it brings the  existence of previous versions (i.e. Ben Hur 1959) to the attention of younger viewers.  Ultimately I'd rather see a remake of Ben Hur to see what modern cinema can do with it than have them remake something from the 90s that's totally unnecessary.  Plus this remake will have absolutely no affect on the 1959 Epic apart from bring it's attention to a younger audience.

Questi aspetti ve li sottolineano fino alla nausea per tutto il film... Ve l'ho gi√† detto che i romani sono degli infami?  2. Solo i cristiani sono puri, buoni e impeccabili (almeno fino al medioevo, ma il regista del film sembra dimenticarsene)  3. Ges√π √® una sorta di fusione ante litteram tra Obi-wan Kenobi e Gandalf che crea piogge miracolose e fa comparse misteriose riuscendo col solo sguardo ad ammutolire anche il centurione pi√π ignorante  3. Gli effetti speciali sono cos√¨ brutti che, si dice, che questo film sia stato d'ispirazione a SHARKNADO  4. Alla fine del film, il tutto si chiude con una canzone pop di una cantante americana in stile Lady Gaga, una colonna sonora in pieno stile imperiale romano insomma  5. Morgan Freeman non fa un cazzo di concreto, come sempre. Oddio, forse fa qualcosa pi√π del solito ma rimane sempre abbastanza inutile.  6. Anche se il film √® une merda (fatta eccezione per la scena della gara di bighe che, in fondo, non √® male), il lord comandante Mormont rimane comunque uno cazzutissimo... No aspetta, forse mi sto confondendo  7. Alla fine, dopo due ore di odii e rancori, dopo che uno dei protagonisti ha tradito la propria famiglia e il proprio fratello, condannando a morte l'una e alla schiavit√π l'altro; dopo vari spargimenti di sangue e la perdita di una gamba, i due fratelli fanno la pace come se niente fosse e tornano ad amarsi perch√© l'ha detto Ges√π, che forse era Obi-Wan kenobi...

This strip is about some boys, 1959 is about real men that actually evolve during the 222 minutes. I don't see what the spectator could learn from this gathering - the audience is left confused and without empowerment. The story jumps without any sense of transition. There is a focus on portraying war in a certain way. I don't think The battles happen in the dark - the commanders are maniacs. I did like the special effects. However they were a little bit over the top. I don't know why modern movies would be dumped down - I mean people are becoming more intelligent throughout the decades.

2019-04-11T20:28:02,"Although I agree with the comments on Hollywood & it's lazy cash cowing of remakes & choosing "" Ben Hur "" to me was a bad idea as it has been made (including this one) 4 times now that it's been remade....  But 2 early B&W versions were not talkies & the movie industry was in it's infancy & believe it or not the movie industry in it's very early genises used B&W Boxing Fights to make its money atbthe start, as Boxing was & still is a huge draw for people, as the pugilistic arts still is apart from when UFC took off, the only thing closed to legal blood sport & what kept the Romans happy with Chariot Races & Gladiatorial Battles made great sense to those who knew how to make money & exploit those doing this within the movie industry, as who doesn't love a good sword & sandles movie...  This genre is not one that has been done to death like the western films but when they did do them they were usually huge movies with big stars & even bigger budgets & after the disastrous attempt at making "" Cleopatra "" with Richard Burton & Elizabeth Taylor the studios decided no more as that movie nearly shut bankrupt Hollywood ti the point of closing it down for good & this was because of the timeframe the movie took to finally finish & the many financial disasters that hit that movie while making it & even the affair that started during the making of this movie with Burton & Taylor wasn't enough to save this movie & this genre was dropped until it eventually found a new audience after a much needed rest from this type of extravagant film..  Yes there's been some movies made about this timeframe & genre but it took Ridley Scott's "" Gladiator "" to make Hollywood & Fans to fall in love with this genre again...  All I know is I've just watched this version & found it to be a very good & entertaining movie that also added more content within the movie as far as the story's narrative was concerned,  but wasn't a butt numbing 3 hours plus movie....  I enjoyed this movie & if you give it a chance you may find, like myself, that although it's another remake it actually adds more overall depth than the Old Charlton Heston movie that's put on Tv every Easter...  And that is my overall point here with regards to the many negative comments & that is  "" Have you even watched this version of Ben Hur! ""  I have never had much love or pander to someone who chooses a career as a critic & have never listened to their opinions whether it was films/books/music et al & I made up my own mind as to whether I liked something not critics...  I myself had tired of the very idea of a 4th version of "" Ben Hur "" as I grew up seeing the old B&W versions & obviously the biggest one that was a box office hit with Charlton Heston &  believe when I say I've seen that movie to the point that I'd never watch it again, & this is coming from a huge movie fan & aficionado of these movie's & it took only recently for me to actually go out of my way to watch this movie..  As I always do with any movie I leave the hype or negativity at the door & this is the best & truest version of Lee Wallace's "" Ben Hur - A Tale Of Christ ""  Although the main actors are well known in the movie industry, they delibaretly for budget reasons I'm guessing, went with actors that wouldn't come with a huge price tag but would still deliver a great performance...  Now I'll admit there are no award winning performances here, but that doesn't mean they didn't do a great job & if you watch this version you'll see a more realistic & potent version of Ben Hur...  Yes there are some content related to the Charlton Heston version but alot of this movie is fresher & has a slightly different take on this epic that was a best selling book which went on to become a book that the studios couldn't wait to make movies about as it has everything within it for a great movie/allegiance/love & hate/betrayal/religion/redemption/forgiveness/revenge & many more & though this movie isn't as long as the Charlton Heston version it crams in more content at half the time of that version...  I have to admit I was completely taken aback at how much they re-envisioned this & how much I enjoyed it, but as always I leave it up to others to make up their mind & not be swayed one way or the other but go in under neutrality...  It's in your hands!... "" To Be Or Not To Be ""   .....",0,0,YouTube Is An Influencer,3BmeR9GYdDU,0.23458299663299662,2019-04-11 20:28:02,False,False
