2015-02-25T16:15:39,UPDATE- So the film was exactly what the trailer showed it's a con turned romance. It's not a great movie but I don't think anyone expected it to be. The producer which also did (crazy stupid love) is trying to make his own lane by meshing genres together in one movie. It will take a while for this producer to find his footing but I must say Will's acting ability to me it's just spot on. The movie is worth watching because as usual you  always want to know what happens to will's character and his charisma will always reel you in.

Its strange logic. Its not as if there aren't any single white ladies out there. I mean, they can pretty much walk into any bar, night club or even a supermarket and find a single white lady today. Instead they are here on the computer. My message to the white guys commenting out there. If you have even a single intelligent brain cell you will realize the fallacy in your arguments. Scientists have proven that variances within any race is greater than the variances between races. That is you will always be able to find a white guy who can jump higher than a black guy, a black guy smarter than a white guy, an asian taller than a xxxx  and so on. I am not implying the reverse is the norm (Logic 101). Anyway, focus on your life, how to be happy. Learn to dance, learn to enjoy music from around the world. See how the more tolerant someone is, the happier they are. If you chose to fall prey to stereotypes, you are not only being stupid and superficial, you are choosing to be unhappy because whether you like it or not the world will be shared by everyone (at least until we invent Skynet). Even superficial is too benign a term because it implies a white color is better and its not. Its not worse but not better either. Isn't it strange how the more intelligent and educated people are the more accepting they are of interracial marriage? Just talk to 20 random white people with PhDs in Biology and 20 white child molestors and see who are more racists. Which group do you want to associate with? Whether you like it or not you are implicitly joining one of these groups. Its your choice. Of course if you want to fuel your stereotypes, it is just as easy to do that. You can find plenty of people of all races to argue with, especially on the internet, where you have trolls to help you along. You may be arguing with another bitter member of another race.

Some of the richest people in the world as well as a lot of the law makers are closet racist. But they let the racism speak through their money and who benefits from it. The world itself has become less of the nurturing environment it was meant to be to more of a Separation of human life. I am black. My friends are a mixture of black, white, asian, hispanic ... yet when we hang out or talk race is never a factor.  The world would be a much better place if we all accept that fact that we are Humans that were put here to grow WITH one another. There is no this race vs that race etc... no one race is bigger or better than the other. We were all built the exact same way. We can reproduce with each other with no problem. There is nothing in our DNA that says we are limited to one color. There is literally too much hatred in this world and its reasoning is borderline psychotic. Wake up people. We were put here because this is the perfect environment for us to survive in. Our jobs are to reproduce and keep the Human Race pushing forward. You will never see a Leopord without spots have to prove he is a leopard or any other animal that was born a different pigment than its parents. They protect and raise their young all the same.
