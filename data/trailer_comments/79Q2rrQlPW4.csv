2015-09-04T01:10:23,"WHY NOT RENAME WORLD'S HIGHEST PEAK - 'MOUNT CHOMOLUNGMA' INSTEAD  On August 31, 2015, President Obama changed the name of Alaska’s Mount McKinley to Denali.  For thousands of years, this mountain was called “Denali” by the  Koyukon Athabaskan people (native American) who lived beneath it.  The native Koyukon Athabascan people call the mountain Denali, which is usually translated as ""The High One"". A gold prospector, William Dickey, named it Mount McKinley in 1896, after President William McKinley.  But today by restoring Mount McKinley with the  native name Denali has given Koyukon Athabaskan people  something to cheer about and to keep their tradition alive.   Therefore i would like to appeal to the Nepalese Government and to the cvitizen of the world,   that the name of Mount Everest should be rename with the native language just as in the case of Mount McKinley. Mount Everest is the Earth's highest mountain, with a peak at 8,848 metres (29,029 ft.) Nepalese call it Sagarmatha. Chinese call it Zhumulangma Feng. But to the Kirat people, the indigenous people of Nepal and the Himalayan regions,  Mount Everest is known as Chomolungma. Kirati religion (Kiratism) revolves around nature worshiping and ancestors worship. Being animist, Kirat people revere Chomolungma as Mother Goddess of the Earth.  The  mountain was named Peak XV and 'was found to be the worlds' highest by the Trigonometric Survey of India in 1852 and it was named Mount Everest on May 11, 1857 by the Royal Geographical Society of London after Sir George Everest, the first Surveyor-General of India. But the indigenous Kirat people such as Limbus and Rais call Chomolungma and Sherpa call it Jhyomolungma for Mount Everest.  As a  Limbu myself,  I would give you more names from my own language: Chenchenlungma  for Mount Kanchanjungha, Phaktanglung for  Kumbhakarna, and so on.  In Limbu language, or say Tibeto-Burman family 'Lung' means stone/rock. '-ma' implies femininity. For instance 'Anga' means me in Limbu language. And when you take 'Aa' prefix and add to '-ma' suffix it becomes 'Amma' means mother in Limbu language. So the suffix ,'-lungma' stand for 'rocky mountain'.  Nature is often taken as feminine   for example: rivers, mountains, jungles etc. So the nomenclature on the basis of colonial linguistic, ethnic, or any means doesn't justify the purity of certain place or mountain etc.  We do have a Nepali proverb:  'BOLNEKO PITHO BIKNE, NABOLNEKO GHIU PANI NABIKNE,' goes for a while. An intellectual debate should not sound like this. No problem with Mount Everest, Sagarmatha, and so on, but one should not forget that what indigenous nations/ nationalities call the mountains or rivers in their own language.  Therefore it is the right thing to do that Mount Everest be rename as Chomolungma instead just like Mount McKinley was change to Denali. Kirati name and language should be honored and respected.",0,4,limbu dilip,79Q2rrQlPW4,0.17733333333333332,2015-09-04 01:10:23,True,True

2018-06-15T12:01:13,"Alguém já pensou, ou tentou utilizar drones na localização e resgate de desaparecidos na zona da morte do monte Everest? Ou no lançamento de provisões como pequenas barracas, pequenos cilindros de oxigênio para o retorno as zonas mais baixas e seguras do monte Everest ou aos postos de apoio ao alpinista, ou lançamento de algum dispositivo de aquecimento a bateria (ou cilindros de gás butano, mas acho que esses não funcionariam por conta do ar rarefeito), mas mantas térmicas, garrafas térmicas, alimentos quentes como sopas em recipientes térmicos, ou bolsas termicas (baterias termicas) para aquecimento das juntas do corpo, ou aquecimento dentro das roupas e extremidades do corpo, seria necessário um compartimento térmico leve e resistente para conduzir e lançar através de alçapão as provisões já próximas ao solo. Se cada montanhista fosse obrigado a subir o monte com um localizador GPS que cotenha um botão de pânico para acionamento do socorro facilitaria também. Os drones conseguem ter um alcance horizontal de mais de 7 km e talvez até mais, um alcance vertical de cerca de 10 km, os mais robustos possuem boa capacidade de carga, muitos com adaptações resistem ao frio, inclusive vi recentemente um vídeo no qual um drone de corrida pequeno alcançou 10km de altura com poucas adaptações para resistir ao frio de -40°C, também hoje muitos drones possuem bons sistemas estabilizadores de vôo e com isso, dependendo do sistema estabilizador de vôo, do peso do aparelho, dos motores utilizados e do processador, conseguem ser extremamente tolerante as fortes rajadas de vento, também muitos já possuem duas câmeras um para o piloto e outra para o operador de câmera que pode trabalhar de forma independente do piloto, pode-se utilizar uma câmera infravermelha, ou térmica para facilitar a localização da vítima, outra coisa é que podem fazer missões autônomas, também possuírem luzes para facilitar sua identificação durante o vôo em ambientes escuros ou com neblina, atualmente podem ser pilotados em primeira pessoa, sem dependência de contato visual, muitos possuem autonomia fica entre 20 min e 40 min dependendo da bateria ou das adaptações, alguns já atingem  velocidade próximas 100km/h e em caso de perda de sinal eles retornam ao posto de comando de forma autônoma, ou caso de apresentarem problemas podem ser localizados enquanto durar a bateria, além de poderem ser resgatados, içados, rapidamente por outros drones, eles também conseguiriam trazer mensagens ou materiais dos alpinistas ao posto de comando. Acredito que poderiam ser muito bem empregados no resgate e apoio de pessoal no Monte Everest e poderiam ficar a disposição para eventuais resgates no última base de apoio dos alpinistas.",0,0,Felipe de Andrade Timóteo,79Q2rrQlPW4,-0.4,2018-06-15 12:01:13,False,False
