2019-04-25T19:02:51,"i see a message from watching this trailer    The adversary  knows your pattern and weaknesses, and in some situations he will know your next move before you make it because, he has studied you. He knows what pushes your buttons, he knows how you fought in the past. He knows what causes you to become abusive, angry , anxious,depressed, and so on.     Sometimes the battle you are in is actually a battle within. Have you ever tried to be better; for example not being a nasty negative person? To abstain from sex. To stop using drugs or drinking.  Any behavior that is contrary to who you once were may become a struggle at some point and your former self will fight for you to return to your former way of thinking, behaving, speaking etc. Change takes effort and is not always easy.    The adversary  has targeted you because you are the chain breaker, you are the one who saw that a change was necessary and you are trying; there is no one else like you in your family. Your change is tied to future generations and if you can break former negative behavior, then hope is restored, peace and promise is attained.       You are  no longer living with the guilt and stress of your former dysfunctional life, you were freed from that and the former you (adversary ) is jealous, so the former you is hunting (tempting) you.    The adversary  is sending the former you to kill the current you. The adversary does NOT want you to receive any of the promises that was created just for you, he doesn't want you to change lives, he wants you to be a slave to sin. So there will be songs, videos, attractive ppl, situations that are uncomfortable to entice you to react the way you once did.   So when those things are before you, be conscience, and remove yourself if possible or fight back! You fight back by declaring who you are currently and decreeing those former ways no longer have power over  you.     The thing you are struggling with is FEAR, embrace it and overcome it!",0,0,Joan Michelle,AbyJignbSj0,-0.03395061728395062,2019-04-25 19:02:51,True,True

I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.  First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm this might be alright.  But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air  Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared  I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'  I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air",2,0,JG310,AbyJignbSj0,0.024592151675485008,2019-04-26 03:15:08,True,True

2019-04-28T16:20:32,"This is literally like the plot from the Metal Gear Solid games. A soldier called Big Boss (then codenamed Naked Snake) is sent to Russia to extract a rocket scientist, Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov. He fails, then finds out his mentor betrays him and his country (yet it is revealed at the end that she was a spy and her mission was to defect; it was given to her by the United States Government). Naked Snake‚Äôs mission is to kill his mentor, The Boss, who‚Äôs like a mother to him, and extract the scientist. He completes his mission (killing his boss at the end) and is awarded the title, ‚ÄúBig Boss‚Äù. Big Boss starts his own organization called ‚ÄúMilitaires San Fronti√®res‚Äù in 1974. Two years earlier, his then-current unit FOX had stolen his DNA and made 3 clones of him: Solid Snake, Liquid Snake, and Solidus Snake. In the late 90‚Äôs Big Boss sends Solid Snake to Outer Heaven, to destroy a walking battle tank, Metal Gear. Solid Snake finds out that Big Boss is behind the whole thing, then kills him. Solid Snake is sent on another mission to Zanzibar Land a few years later, to destroy another Metal Gear and extract a scientist. At the end, Snake discovers that Big Boss was behind Zanzibar as well (the Big Boss killed in Outer Heaven was a Phantom), so he ‚Äúkills‚Äù him. In the early 2000s, Snake is sent to a nuclear disposal facility, Shadow Moses Island, in the Fox Archipelago. Solid Snake‚Äôs rival and the boss of the operation, Liquid Snake, uncovers to Snake at the end that Big Boss was their father, and that they were both clones.

2019-07-25T21:34:02,"I love this!!!! I feel that this movie is deeper too tho! I look at it as YING AND YANG! The HIGHER and LOWER SELF! The GOOD SELF, the NEGATIVE SELF! The war WITHIN but YOU are winning the WAR WITH your INNER SELF! ALSO overcoming your inner SELF! The EGO etc! I always see things DEEPER than what‚Äôs on the surface! ITS LIKE YOU ARE PUTTING YOURSELF IN CHECK! Sorry if I see things so deep lol but I‚Äôm a very SPIRITUAL being and I just look at how things can be interpreted IN MORE than one way! ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è THATS ALL! So I just want to break down SPIRITUALLY this TRAILER! From my perspective anyway!  When you flashed that flash light on YOURSELF, it was you shining LIGHT on DARKNESS! YOUR DARK SELF! Or OLD SELF! The SELF that was once CONTROLLED! The NEGATIVE SELF! Calling it out! Making it TRANSPARENT! Finally SEEING it for the VERY FIRST TIME within YOURSELF!  And then Dark side says: Because IM THE BEST! LIGHT SIDE says: You are OBVIOUSLY not the BEST! Dark side: You just trying to RATTLE ME! LIGHT SIDE: I‚Äôm TRYING TO SAVE YOU! Metaphorically saying IM SAVING YOU FROM YOURSELF! In life you sometimes HAVE TO SAVE YOURSELF pulling YOURSELF out of your TRAUMAS or NEGATIVE BELIEF SYSTEMS that may have been passed down to you! The fight happens and they BOTH fall into a BODY of WATER! The ego/old self and the HIGHER SELF is FIGHTING one another and dealing with the REBIRTH process and it‚Äôs DIFFICULT because now it‚Äôs WORK having to work on your TRAUMAS and other DARK aspects of YOURSELF after coming from manipulative situations! Dark Self asks, you mind if I shoot YOU and LIGHT SELF THROWS grenade and Dark side shoots it back at the MIRROR reflecting it back at LIGHT SELF! Metaphorically, THE DARK keeps trying to take over the HIGHER SELF AND NEW MIND FRAME after finally living in TRUTH AND FREEDOM! Woman asks HENRY: has this ever happened to you before, your OWN government trying to KILL you? Henry replies: Nah that‚Äôs NEW! I see this as metaphorically being POLICED by a STRONG BELIEF SYSTEM or HIGHER AUTHORITY ALMOST like coming from a religious upbringing and once getting older and realizing that you have your OWN mind, you begin to have your OWN beliefs no longer being controlled by how parents and religious people feel you should LIVE! Some parents see themselves as YOUR CONTROLLERS meaning you have to live how they say live or be disowned or possibly an OUTCAST! Many PARENTS feel that your beliefs should align with THEIRS and they BRAINWASH you to think like THEM! So this creates TWO SIDES within your self! Two aspects! The LOWER SELF (the negative part of you living in FEAR, possibly ANXIETY, MENTAL TORTURE and CONTROL) and the HIGHER SELF (the POSITIVE ASPECT you begin to have after realizing the control you were under and now you are able to be FREE CHOOSING to live how YOU feel is BEST). So then there is the PARENT or the CONTROL HANDLER, the MANIPULATOR telling the DARK SELF that the LIGHT self has to DIE because if NOT, everything that they have worked for is at stake! in other words, EVERYTHING that they taught you, you have abandoned for the sake of your OWN happiness and FREE WILL and if the LIGHT SIDE (higher self) WINS meaning you living the rest of your life FREE FROM BONDAGE, then everything they TRIED TO PUSH ON YOU GROWING UP ETC would have been all for NUTHING SO IN OTHER WORDS, they rather you live in DARKNESS for the sake of THEIR OWN HAPPINESS! Not allowing you to be TRUE TO SELF! They don‚Äôt want you to have FREE WILL! They rather you go THE DIRECTION THEY TELL YOU TO GO! (CONTROL)..... I ALSO SAY THIS SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE being that I‚Äôm TRANSGENDER and watching OTHERS go through this when they have come from VERY RELIGIOUS UPBRINGINGS! So the bad guy who created the evil side of WILL SMITH SAYS HE LOVES HIM and then hugs him. (HUGGING THE DARK SELF) This is instilling a FALSE SENSE OF LOVE within THE DARK SELF that they have CREATED so that the dark self will feel that his CONTROL HANDLER (MANIPULATOR) has his best interests at heart! In actuality, the CONTROL HANDLER KNOWS that the DARK SELF IS ASLEEP and isn‚Äôt aware of what‚Äôs going on! Next, the control handler faces the HIGHER SELF (HENRY) saying you are the inspiration behind all of this! In other words saying that you leaving the FOLD and living your OWN life is the reason you caused all of this! (The things that come along with leaving the fold, silent treatment from parents being disowned etc)......I say this because some authority figures, parents etc go so far as cutting ties and doing things to keep their children in a state of looking for acceptance so they gaslight, ghost them and cause emotional torment! So the control handler saying that he should make a whole army is -> authority figures/parents rewarding you with MORE pain due to the fact that you have come into your own! So to SUM IT ALL UP! Some parents and authority figures will TRY to KILL OFF your HIGHER SELF ASPECT because they want control and will do things to kill your spirit whether they realize this or NOT! I‚Äôm dealing with this in ways I can‚Äôt even begin to write out! It‚Äôs as if you have to live how ppl want you to live in order to BE ACCEPTED and it‚Äôs WRONG! So the message is, you may be DISOWNED, PUT OUT, SHUNNED, SCRUTINIZED, DOUBLE TEAMED, scapegoated, GHOSTED OR EVEN IN A PLACE where they will try to KILL your inner spirit because they SEE THAT YOU ARE OVERCOMING THEIR MANIPULATION TACTICS ... Hence this is why they want to HIGHER SELF DEAD..... they rather you LIVE in the dark while they are happy and you SAD BUT YOU HAVE to literally SAVE YOURSELF from yourself because sometimes you begin to battle within and the war between your dark side and light side will begin to become TRANSPARENT to you! That‚Äôs all! I just had to say this! I hope it resonates with somebody! üò©‚ò∫Ô∏èüíôü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",0,0,Sunkee Angel,AbyJignbSj0,0.1633963383838385,2019-07-25 21:34:02,True,True

Great actor / Bad movie I am just a normal guy who likes to be entertained by movies and am not an expert by any means nor have experience in making movies.  That being said, I have advice for Gemini Man 2...... 1. There are movies that take great pains to make the firearm usage and fight scenes as realistic as possible like the Bourne movies and even more so the John Wick series. Please do not copy        these. Please keep with your current style of making the movie totally unrealistic & unbelievable. 2. The fight scenes were very fast, I would say even inhumanly fast and did not look realistic, maybe you can speed them up some in the sequel? Like maybe 3X - 4X's faster? 3. There is never too much CGI, why have real, believable action when you can use fake looking CGI.

This is a well written, directed and acted movie, all the way through. Yes the plot line is fantastical, but it is carried out convincingly, and the relationships feel genuine, as does the action. Winstead combines a deep, natural beauty with an intelligent confidence, and never seems artificial as a government agent in harm‚Äôs way. And Will Smith plays the part just so; he has truly become a fine actor and that helps him transcend the action movie hero into someone relatable. The storyline never feels rushed, like most movies today appealing to the ADHD clientele they seemingly seek. I paid $10 for my ticket.

Just wait ‚Äôtil you get a load of this shit!‚Äù Lee exclaimed exuberantly in an interview. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be projecting so many goddamn frames per second, your eyes‚Äôll fall out of their fucking sockets!‚Äù he added.¬†  Lee also expressed interest in a follow-up to 2005‚Äôs Brokeback Mountain, a film which, like Life of Pi, garnered massive critical acclaim and awards consideration. ‚ÄúYeah, the intimate drama stuff was cool and all, but just think of how much better it‚Äôd be if we crammed an extra 19,976 frames into every fucking second?‚Äù Then, with a sly smirk, he added, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to make a 35 mm print of it, and then watch the poor son of a bitch who has to project that thing on film. He‚Äôd probably burn the whole goddamn theater down!‚Äù Lee laughed.¬†  Although Lee‚Äôs recent Gemini Man was panned by critics, with many complaining about its high frame rate, Lee had this to say to his dissenters: ‚ÄúGo fuck yourself. 120 FPS is nothing, virgins. We‚Äôre only scratching the surface. What, you too chickenshit to watch a frame rate 5 times faster than usual? How ‚Äòbout if we made it literally 833 times faster! That‚Äôll show you fuckers! Your brains won‚Äôt even be able to process just how many images we‚Äôre able to squeeze into every single second of runtime! You could literally slow it down to 1/800 speed, and the fucking picture still wouldn‚Äôt be choppy! You gonna sack up and watch it, or are you too much of a pussy?‚Äù Afterwards, Lee began doing a chicken impersonation, presumably mocking his dissenters.¬†  ‚ÄúI dare you guys to make one more stupid fucking complaint, like that it looks like a¬† ‚Äòhellish cross between a video game and a telenovela.‚Äô Fuck off, Odie Henderson. It‚Äôll look like whatever I goddamn want it to look like. I eagerly await the day when you‚Äôre forced to sit down and watch two cowboys going at it with motion so smooth that the human mind literally can‚Äôt even comprehend it. Then you assholes‚Äôll know who‚Äôs boss!‚Äù  At press time, Lee also announced he was planning a follow-up to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon at an experimental 100,000 FPS. ‚ÄúJust go ahead and try to stop me, fuckers!‚Äù Lee shouted to reporters. ‚ÄúIf Life of Pi didn‚Äôt make you believe in God, then this sure as hell will!‚Äù",6,1,Koolin Dagang,AbyJignbSj0,0.016097843129093136,2019-12-07 07:50:40,False,True
