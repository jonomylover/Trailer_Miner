Hopefully with this film, they're going for the slow build up, big climax at the end approach style of filming.

It's just hard to see destruction and chaos in a place where most of the people are just trying to live their honest daily life. I guess I would equate it to how watching Breaking Bad should be difficult to watch due to how relationships can really break down that way.

Following Julius Caesar's death Cicero became an enemy of Mark Antony in the ensuing power struggle, attacking him in a series of speeches. He was proscribed as an enemy of the state by the Second Triumvirate and consequently executed by soldiers operating on their behalf in 43 BC after having been intercepted during attempted flight from the Italian peninsula.
