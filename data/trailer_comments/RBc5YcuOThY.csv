2016-05-31T14:58:41,"Another promising horror movie and another disappointment. This could've been very creepy , eerie and effective film, but it satisfied itself being lame, cliche, bland and less than mediocre attempt at ghost story. I liked the lead actress, you could see tention and fear all over her face in certain moments, production and locations in the movie are great, Zlatibor county in Serbia is really beautiful and it was ambitious attempt at creating something new.  The problem is that movie comes of as incoherent. It seemed like there wasn't long term planing or vision put into creating it, and it felt like they were writing the next scene while shooting another. Scares are nothing more than jump scares and it is the easiest and laziest way to go, you really do not care about these people, story and character motivation is very weak and certain parts just come out of nowhere without any explanation or resolution. Ending makes zero sense and last shot is cringeworthy.
