Is it because it requires you to hold back from your regular indulgances or the fact that you see the world as a bad place in which you think no loving God would leave his people? If so I can answer at least these few questions. What makes religion any different than your nations laws? Not much other than religion effecting every aspect of one's life and not just a legal ruling. The other thing is that God gave mank I nd free will. There were many times recorded in the Bible in which God intervened but that changes after Jesup Christmas died on the cross. After that it became up to us as a people to make our decisions. So therefore we make our own mistakes. Even if the one who makes a mistake is not you and y I u end up suffering, we'll that's life. It's not fair unfortunately.

2014-07-10T07:17:56,"To banido really God doesn't play favorites. But he shows just how wonderful and powerful he is. He took an extremely small virtually unknown tribe and from that tribe men (namely Moses and Aaron who I hope is given a proper role in this movie) that he knew would be devoted to him. Well as devoted as any man can be (read the book of Exodus and you'll see what I mean lol). He made through them his existence known throughout THE WORLD (well the major kingdoms and empires throughout the region). For now GREATLY known is Israel throughout the world. That's how God works he will take those that are small and humble and he knows will be devoted to him. Then he will do GREAT things with them and through them. He wouldn't choose a foul prideful nation like Egypt (or any great nation). I mean come on the king of Egypt wanted to be worshiped as a god on earth. Never mind the fact that they wouldn't worship the one true living God. They worshiped the sun and slabs of stone really? Also he kills the first born as a FINAL testament to prove that God will now be ignored. Like Israel we can expect many great things from god if we turn to him through Christ. But also like Egypt if we turn away from God and refuse him. We should expect NOTHING less then his WRATH. NO ONE and I mean no one should want to experience his wrath. For it is written that he will not save this world a second time. But save those who seek him through his son. I could go on and on about linage, laws and revelation. But you're smart right? Got it all figure out right? Got too much pride to be wrong RIGHT? Till one day you realize you don't got it all figure out. But by then they'll be closing the casket door on you.

2014-07-14T15:25:42,"Why I'm Excited For EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS (my opinion):  1. Fantastic cast of character actors - Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton, John Turturro, Aaron Paul, Sigourney Weaver, Ben Mendelsohn, Ben Kingsley.  2. Ridley Scott is a great director who can direct actors incredibly well, and has a beautiful and detailed visual style that I think can help make translate this story for the big screen for this new decade, despite his last decade of films being not good (cough *Robin Hood* cough).  3. Steven Zallian (writer of SCHINDLER'S LIST and THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO American Remake) is the main screenwriter of the film, and so far from these films, he's a incredible screenwriter who can do no wrong as long as he has a great director to adapt and translate it well to the screen, that being Ridley Scott.  4. It's another film adaptation of the Exodus from the bible. Right now, it think it's an appropriate time for another live-action adaptation of it. Even if you're not into the bible, you have to admit that the story is really epic and entertaining, which is why I think it's one of the most adapted stories on the screen. In this decade, not counting any television series or animated film adaptations, it would be nice to see how the story is adapted, updated, and translated with new technology, actors, and crew. Even if the movie isn't good, you could tell the actors and filmmakers are trying to tell a good story with something we've seen so many times. And finally, we still have THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and THE PRINCE OF EGYPT, two already mind-blowing film adaptations of the source material with different takes on the tale, yet still keeping what made the story so great to begin with, the epic scale, the conflict between every single character, and the moral decisions characters face to do what they think is right, whether it's good or bad, and for the better or worst.",0,0,DieHardAlien,mZPMU9riKl4,0.25986652236652236,2014-07-14 15:25:42,True,True

Consequently, most DNA studies have been carried out on modern Egyptian populations with the intent of learning about the influences of historical migrations on the population of Egypt.  In general, various DNA studies have found that the gene frequencies of modern North African populations are intermediate between those of the Near East, southern Europe and Sub Saharan Africa, though the frequency distributions of the non-recombining portion of the Y chromosome of modern Egyptian population appear to be much more similar to those of the Middle East than to any sub-Saharan African population, suggesting a much larger Eurasian genetic component.  Blood typing and DNA sampling on ancient Egyptian mummies is scant; however, blood typing of dynastic mummies found ABO frequencies to be most similar to modern Egyptians and some also to Northern Haratin populations.

Therefore, you cannot cast a caucasian actor to play Moses and then cast a black actor as Ramses and his parents. Even an all-black casting, as some proposed, would've raised a big fuss (even bigger than this), because then, jews would be played by black actors. The lack of ethnic variety in Hollywood's stars is always something to be lamented, but when a studio's spending $150+million on a project like this, you can understand why they decided to go with established, white actors.

When Moses led the people across the red sea, they stopped at a place that had 12 wells of water and 72 palm trees. Why in the world would this be recorded? it seems like a useless fact. and besides who would count the palm trees? this seems stupid until you go back and find that there were 12 brothers and 72 people who went down to Egypt upon the invitation of the pharaoh nearly 300 years earlier.  If the bible were made up by various authors, why in the world would they include these almost seemingly useless details? It was a sign to the people traveling out of Egypt that they were on the correct path, so they recorded it on paper. or papyrus to be specific. and Moses who was most likely, the only one who knew how to read and write, did the recording.  These seemingly useless facts are replete throughout the bible. people who only read the surface never see these connections. and thus it is written ""Seeing, they do not see.

2014-08-10T03:13:08,"Historical errors in this trailer: 1. Its in English. 2. Armor and military equipment are of later time periods (for example steel swords, Romanesque armor of Moses, the use of armored mounted cavalry, using cloth pennants, etc.). 3. The architecture is far to large expansive for the Egypt at the time of the traditional dates the Exodus has been estimated to have taken place. 4. The brief depiction of the Israelite slaves in the pit is an extreme exaggeration of the slavery of Israel (which some historians claim may have been more akin to a client state than slavery itself). 5. Moses, as the adopted son of the daughter of Pharaoh, would have never been so close to Ramses, or likely have called him brother. 6. Biblical records portray the personalities of Moses and Ramses very differently than how they appear here (Moses is not outspoken possibly shy, and Ramses is confident and shrewd). 7. Most traditional and Biblical scholars/historians agree that the sea that the Israelites crossed is the Reed Sea (which is extinct) not the Red Sea. 8. Every bit of dialogue, and every movement of each and every character has no evidence to support that this took place exactly as depicted. Yet, all we can find to complain about is the fact that is the actors are all white? I mean if Ridley Scott hired dark skinned black men to play the role, how would we know if their skin was too dark? Or if Hispanic's skin is too light? Was he suppose to hold auditions in Egypt, and have each actor hold their hand to the hieroglyphs and match the color of the Egyptians as portrayed? If you go into a film looking for historical accuracy then honestly you will never find a good film. I understand wanting to have some ethnic diversity, but don't make it like some monumental historical sin. I just want it to be entertaining, engaging, thought provoking, and bring something new to the table when discussing the Exodus story.

I really don't understand why everyone gets so angry with each other as soon as something religious pops up. As a Christian, I believe that Jesus told us to love everybody. Every single person. He didn't say ""only treat people that believe the same thing you do with respect.""  So other Christians, for the love of God, stop spreading hate. Don't act like you're better than others just because you believe in God. Don't tell them crap like they're stupid or evil for not believing in God. You're never going to show them Jesus's love for them that way. And please get your facts straight. I've really had enough of cringing at people's comments that try to argue against things like evolution without understanding it. Show people love, guys. I know you can. Just try to see everyone the way that God sees them; as people worthy of love.   And atheists, I'm not going to bully you and tell you you're going to hell. I have no right to say things like that. In the end, that's God's decision. But I would ask that you get your facts straight as well. All these mean arguments start because a lack of understanding. Don't make assumptions based on what you think you know. A little research never hurt anyone. If you don't believe in God, I'm not going to say that's fine, because it'd would overjoy me for everyone to of know God's love. But I don't think anyone was ever saved by being screamed at and talked down to. I'll pray for you, those who read this far and especially those that didn't. If that upsets you, I'm sorry, but honestly I don't think being prayed for by someone you don't know is going to do you any harm either. ",0,0,Katelin Forrester,mZPMU9riKl4,-0.0029478458049886614,2014-08-19 12:01:53,True,True

Don't crucify me for this youtube its an opinion. Also there are barely three - four actors shown in detail - hardly a detailed demographic of Egyptian culture. If one looks at the anthropological studies conducted on Egyptian remains from the time period - its clear that they were neither one nor the other. Tut's skull for example bears hallmarks of African and Middle-Eastern racial characteristics thus making skin (and eye) colour an unknown quality. If one looks to wall frescos and paintings - a wide range of tan colours are shown along with very pale white skin for goddesses and high ranking nobles - this most likely demonstrates their social standing rather than racial orientation - pale skin = less time spent working in the fields under the boiling hot sun. Whilst I would hesitate to say anything definitive on youtube - I will spell one thing out: we have no definitive proof of skin, hair or eye colour for ""Ancient Egyptians"" of the period shown above so quit whining and enjoy the movie. ",0,0,Alexenter11,mZPMU9riKl4,0.05494444444444446,2014-08-20 17:27:22,True,True

There were SEVERAL different types of Egyptians, because other Empires came to conquer them. The Asians came and conquered Egypt too, which was around Moses' time period (ca. 1250 BC). These people were called the Hyksos (look it up).. So if anything, The Pharoah Ramses and the Egyptians should mostly look like tanned/dark Asians.. So Bollywood actors will definitely pass for them. Now around Cleopatra's time (40 BC), they were white. Why? Because Cleopatra wasn't even Egyptian, she was GREEK! And the Romans took over Egypt at that point and placed puppet leaders.  Nowadays, Egypt has been taken over by the ARABS: basically Muslims. There are still Nubians living in Egypt, but think of them as the Native Americans in America..living in Reservations.

Another explanation may be to draw ignorant people to be given the opportunity to berate them for their ignorance, whilst choosing to ignore or supply a vague counter point to any argument that may weaken your argument. You will use these other commentors like your human shield as they defend your point in a way that you would never have thought of.  Ultimately, the comment chain will descend into essay long arguments on an issue (usually between 2 or 3 people) that will stray from the original discussion entirely. This may also ignite the interest of earlier commentors and cause them to jump in and correct any mistakes when they can be bothered to follow the discussion.   Of course no comment chain is complete without the mindless morons that spew something that vaguely resembles an unjustified opinion with no reasoning and is predominantly comprised of abuse, leading to ultimate termination from the discussion and an escort to the spam section.

Its the fact they ironically get they're casting spot on, black/dark skinned people, right up until casting the main cast. Quite laughable really...

2014-09-15T14:57:46,"While the Prince of Egypt will always hold this story's place in my heart, I'll give this movie a shot. High hopes, but low expectations though. Just because today, it makes more sense to play things safe and extreme. The Prince of Egypt took risks and took it's time.   Compare the scene of ""brotherhood"" in this trailer and the animated film. In the Prince of Egypt, Moses and Ramesses have a chariot race, get scolded by Pharaoh, and then talk about their problems alone. Here, they clash swords and smile. Yeah, real fraternal! (sarcasm) My point is the kind of pacing and tact this story requires is a rarely done right, and not just in modern times. The Ten Commandments made the two enemies from near the beginning. This movie seems to be trying to have it's cake and eat it.  The casting is also a little wonky. Mainly on Christian Bale as Moses. When I picture Moses, I of course think of the Prince of Egypt version, someone who started out petulant and immature but grew into his leadership. Then again, there's the Moses of the Ten Commandments played by Charlton Heston who was one of the greatest actors of all time. Bale can be a badass, but I don't see him as much of a leader. Moses was strong but he was also patient. Think of him like Optimus Prime, he doesn't need to raise his voice, but even when he speaks softly his words have such command to them. Bale might offer up a different interpretation but he's got some big sandals to fill.  Lastly, I do feel this isn't exactly the right time to release this movie, you could have shot, edited it, and everything; but perhaps delayed it's actual release for a couple years. It saddens me deeply that religious worship, and media centering around it thereof, receives such venom by most people. (I'm not speaking of those who simply respectively aren't religious as you certainly don't need to be to enjoy the story, but those who are wrathfully anti-practice.) All this movie would do is give more fuel to their fire. Again, the Prince of Egypt allowed us to see God's mercy and love through both Moses' love of his brother and the happiness he found in Midian as well as His power through the Burning Bush, plagues, parting of the sea, etc. This movie seems to be gearing again for the Ten Commandment's fire and brimstone interpretation. Back to my original point, because it's ""safer"" to go that route rather than attempt at any kind of risky majesty or gentleness.  Now I still will likely see this movie, just hoping that it will exceed my expectations.",0,0,Anthony Clay,mZPMU9riKl4,0.20314550264550266,2014-09-15 14:57:46,True,True

You never been a part of this history and if you had some knowledge about this history you would have known much more than your comments shows.  First of... To all of you that are saying that africans havent done nothing, lets see here. The first christian state/kingdom was in Abessinia (today known as mainly Eritrea and Ethiopia) concurring all naboring empires and had controll over south arabia for centuries, and several of victories over their main rival the persians. The Persians refereed to them as people drinking from crystals. Before that time they were called the land of Punt who the egyptians referred as their brothers and they were the ones who provided them with all the nessesay recourses. In west africa you had the Shongai empire known to be the land of the richest man ever that have been in this planet (Musa Mensa). This empire was also known to strong on resources and education systems. And I can continue on forever...  But to Egypt: This story about Ramesis and Moses is based on a story that we read in the bible. Have it ever occurred that it can be inaccurate? Everybody knows that holy book have been changed several of times. From Islams perspective who are 1,8 billion people it is said in their books that it wasent Ramesis that died in the water, it was his son. Ramesis was known to have lived for many years and he was known to have won several of wars but he also died in a war. When you see studies about his MUMMIFIED body he got injuries in areas where you would have died. But if you look at his sons body that is not mummified, he is injure free.  In the holy koran it is said that his body was gonna be preserved by god as an example to they who wil come after him. And til today it is preserved without being mummifed and That is said in the holy koran. It is also said that Moses (Musa in islam) was a very dark man with curly hair so what was the rest of bani Israel (the jews)? Im not saying that everybody was black but I wanna point out how brainwashed some of you are... You can read about this yourself and if you choose not to then, enjoy living in a lie ;) Its also a lot that refers Moses in the bible to be a black man.

It was after the discovery of King Tut Tomb that opinion started to change the Europeans are the ones who made known the wealth and complexity of Ancient Egyptian Civilization to these Arab invaders that they decided to claim the history as their own. Ancient Egyptians artifacts are scattered all around the world, the early European Egyptian explorers found tombs of gold and beautifully crafted artifacts they were able to sell to museums in Europe and the United States. This only happened because these Muslim invaders were foreigners who occupied the land and did not know or understand Ancient Egyptian history they had to be taught and shown by Europeans the value of Ancient Egyptian culture. Study Arabic culture and study the Middle East and you will learn nothing about Ancient Egypt, but study African languages, African dances, African burials, African religions, African dress and African kingship and you were learn everything about Ancient Egypt. All of the lands south and southeast of Egypt the Egyptians called, Ta-netjer , ""God's Land."" They believed their gods and ancestors came from these lands.

The truth is during this time in history, if scientist are correct, the egyptions would have been dark skinned africans. Call it what you want. You don't have to use the political term of black or white. It is true that Africans come in different shades, but they are still Africans. And if we are comfortable to say that these ancient egyptions were not ""black"", we should be safe to say that the societies that formed later, like greece and rome were not ""white"".

Lolz) to Tolomey, but the toyal egption lineage was distroyed, just like the Phoenicians, the Tolomey had children through the royal bloodline. It wasnt like all the africans were killed and all of a sudden all of egypt is mespo, greek people.  Lolz.... My point is yes, Cleapatras grand father is Tolomey ftom Mesopotamia,  but her great great grand mother, grand mother, and mither are still linage of the african blood line.

Mind you, I am by no means even close to a believer, but Militant Atheism is the other face of the coin from Religion. As for Religion, any believer who quotes scripture or uses it to support an argument is guilty of using religion when spirituality is an end-in-itself. If you believe in the Bible, then you believe in Goodness (whatever it is) and that Evil is rid by people rising above the muck of human experience and being good themselves. The message of Jesus Christ is not hate nor retaliation, it is forgiveness and love.  Enough of this hate between people.

2014-10-22T06:04:04,"I'm Creole aka Caribbean of French and West African descents. Let me start to say that Afrocentric people are one of the dumbest group of people I've met. It seems they have never read a book and had never been to school.  How can any educated person not know that Africa doesn't mean BLACK? Africa is a mass of land that is given a name and the boundaries were conventionally given to what is conventionally called a continent. In the process, they included Arabic (AKA Semitic) countries within that conventionally so called continent. In different areas are different group of people in that continent. The darkest group of people on that land mass live in the West. They are not just Black, but they have full lips, big nose for the most part, and a couple other physical characteristics common to themselves particularly. To the East there are the Ethiopians, Somalians etc... who are a completely ethnic group, with completely different physical characteristics. They have dark skins too, but not nearly as dark as the West Africans. To the South, you originally had the same people than the West until the Anglos came and occupied them. Anglos just love conquest and to bring destruction on people around the world but that's not the discussion here. To the North you have the Arabs and there are many countries of them such as Morocco, Libya _the country Pres. Obama [another Anglo, mind you] destroyed_  and so on. You also have the people in what is known as Horn of Africa. I don't expect Afrocentric people to know about it, but there people there, although dark, they don't look like the West Africans.  Why I put so much emphasis on West Africans? Because they are the center of Afrocentrism and they believe all Africa is inhabited by them or belong to them.  Black Americans are Anglo and West African descent, but you'll find very few that really look like the West Africans.  Creoles and Black Americans loom brown to Africans. West Africans make us look like gold, and they make white people look like skinned animals.  Some of you don't even know that Australia is the only place that had exclusively Black people until the Anglos brought destruction to that place, you know. They don't look like the Blacks in Africa. In human standard, they are really scary looking.

2014-10-23T21:49:43,"Modern Egyptians Have Absolutely NOTHING to do with Ancient Egyptians.......Let's give the Math and the Science Scholarly Facts..... Modern Egyptian population is not representative of the ancients ""Cosmopolitan, North and South Egypt is less likely to have  a population representative of the core indigenous population of the most ancient times“ – Keita 2005. History in Africa, 2005, 32(1).221-246 ""Outside influence and admixture with extraregional groups primarily occurred in Lower Egypt—perhaps during the later dynastic periods, but especially in Ptolmaic and Roman times”  -Irish 2009. Dental_affinities_of_the_C-group_inhabitants.. Ec Hi Rev Modern Egyptians a mixed population with European and Arab strands-not identical to ancients: “Classical genetic studies show a high degree of genetic heterogeneity in the modern Egyptian population, suggesting that this population is descended from a mixture of African, Asian, and Arabian stock (Mahmoud et al. 1987; Hafez et al. 1986). Genetic heterogeneity within the Egyptian gene pool is also supported by more recent studies using autosomal STR markers (Klintschar et al. 1998; 2001)."" ---Manni et al 2002. Y-chromosome analysis in Egypt, Hum Bio, 74:5, 645-658 Many of today’s Egyptians are not necessarily representative of Ancients due to outside migration and admixture from European/Arab sources, particularly in Lower Egypt. Some Coptic claims to be pharanoic descendants not supported by DNA studies or cultural history showing heavy Arabization since 900 AD Modern Copt genetic profile shows substantial Middle Eastern and European elements: [quote:] "" The bulk of genetic diversity appears to be a consequence of recent migrations and demographic events mainly from Asia and Europe, evident in a higher migration rate for speakers of Afro-Asiatic as compared with the Nilo-Saharan family of languages, and a generally higher effective population size for the former... The current communities are known to be largely the product of recent migrations from Egypt over the past two centuries..“  ---Hassan et al. 2008. Y-chromosome variation.."" Am J. Phy An. v137,3. 316-323 Who are they Like?? Nubians are related to ancient Egyptians... ""Studies of cranial morphology also support the use of a Nubian (Kerma) population for a comparison of the Dynastic period, as this group is likely to be more closely genetically related to the early Nile valley inhabitants than would be the Early and Late Dynastic Egyptians, who likely experienced significant mixing with other Mediterranean populations (Zakrzewski, 2002). A craniometric study found the Naqada and Kerma populations to be morphologically similar (Keita, 1990). Given these and other prior studies suggesting continuity (Berry et al., 1967; Berry and Berry, 1972), and the lack of archaeological evidence of major migration or population replacement during the Neolithic transition in the Nile valley, we may cautiously interpret the dental health changes over time as primarily due to ecological, subsistence, and demographic changes experienced throughout the Nile valley region.""  -Starling & Stock 2007. Dental indicators of health.. AJPA 134: 520-28- The Science and DNA....(Using Figure Below) Genetic Analysis of Amarna Mummies Geographical analysis of the Amarna mummies was performed using their autosomal STR profiles based on 8 tested loci.4 Results are summarized in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1. Maps for  individual Amarna mummies are included in Figures 2-8 in the Appendix. Discussion: Average MLI scores in Table 1 indicate the STR profiles of the Amarna mummies would be most frequent in present day populations of SEVERAL AFRICAN regions: including the Southern African  (average MLI 326.94), African Great Lakes (average MLI 323.76), and Tropical West African (average MLI 83.74) regions.  These regional matches indicate an exclusively African ancestry for the pharaonic family. The, results indicate these ancient individuals inherited that today are more frequent in populations of Africa than in other parts of the world (such as D18S51=19 and D21S11=34). Conclusion Results indicated the autosomal STR profiles of the Ancient period mummies were most frequent in modern populations in several parts of AFRICA. These results are based on the 8 STR markers for which these pharaonic mummies have been tested, which allow a preliminary geographical analysis for these individuals who lived in Egypt during the Amarna period of the 14th century BCE, and thenceforth  Results suggest exclusively African ancestry, geographical analysis suggests ancestral links with neighboring populations in Africa for the studied pharaonic mummies.

In the book of 1 Kings, it says that ""In the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, King Shishak(Shosinque) of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem.""  So that brings us to 930BCE. 1 Kings says Solomon ruled for 40 years and that in the fourth year of his reign he built the Temple. So now we are at 966BCE. 1 Kings says that the temple was built 480 years after the Exodus. so that means the Exodus occurred at about 1446BCE during the reign of Thutmose III or possibly his stepmother Hatshepsut, whom was document as one of most prolific builders in ancient Egypt .

For example, if a religious person believes that homosexuals should not get married because such a union does not exist in the Bible (or other holy book), that does not mean that religions, such as Christianity, forsake the very idea. There are many altruistic ideas and moral doctrines that can be extrapolated from holy books that supersede such hateful acts such as banning same sex marriage, or inequities between genders.

The statues and imagery of pharaohs and Egyptian people closely resembled the physical traits of Africans. Egypt also resides in the continent of Africa.  And to those saying that Israelites like Jesus and the prophets were black, no, most of them most likely were not black, and Jesus was not an African. A small percentage of Israelites had a light complexion, While the majority were tanned or had brown skin, but they lacked the physical features of Africans, unlike the Egyptians who shared Identical traits. Israelites share many of the same physical traits as other Middle Eastern people.   Claiming that Jesus was African or Asian is just as absurd as claiming Jesus was the white, blue eyed devil that we know as Cesare Borgia. (Son of Pope Alexander VI).   The Bible states Jesus was an israelite. not a European, not an African, and not an Asian. An Israelite.

I remember i once heard of a Hollywood project about Hannybal (the ancient conqueror who fought against Rome, not the fictional serial killer). Since Carthago (not sure in English how it's written) was in Africa, someboby thought at Denzel Washington for the role. Unfortunately, Carthago was in Africa but it was actually a colony, and Phoenicians were Mid-Easterns. So, basically, a black guy couldn't portray him. And they didn't, thank to god.

Granted, some Egyptians were black, but according to ancient Egyptian texts, blacks were always acknowledged as foreigners. As for the similar look between blacks (only applies to _some_ light skinned American blacks) and Egyptians, well you can thank your native American heritage for that.

From the eyes of the charters within a world where nearly every natural phenomenon was viewed as a supernatural event everything was miracle. With careful reading I believe God was the same yesterday today and tomorrow and the events of his interaction with us are still viewed with the eyes of faith. One thought; do you ever wonder why the mixed multitudes were so quick to grumble ? If the miracles were as plain as modern movies make them, how quick the vision went away. Read the parting of the Red Sea (Sea of Reeds)  carefully, and understand the east wend blew all night and the Israelites crossed on a sand bar probably during an extremely low tide and  the Roman chariots chased them, when the chariots pursued they got stuck, taking off the wheels they continued but the water came up and they drowned probably due to the wearing of heavy armor as well as ancient people didn't know how to swim. Is that still a miracle ? To me its a believable story that doesn't have to transcend the natural world. Their were, and are, many miracles like this to this day. There was not a fantasy world sometime in the past.  But God does causes his plan to ultimately come to pass using the environment he created.

West Africans had nothing to do with Ancient Egypt. Just because their skin colour matches yours, it does not mean they were your ethnicity type.

2014-12-17T06:44:14,"Since there are so many myths and half-truths being spread, here is a mostly unbiased summary of the whole ancient Egyptian ""race"" issue based on the last few decades of evidence-based research by Egyptologists:  Egypt was not originally one kingdom, but was originally two kingdoms. Lower Egypt (northern Egypt) was inhabited by brown-skinned people we'd today call ""Middle-Eastern"". Upper Egypt (southern Egypt) was inhabited by black-skinned people we today call ""Nubians"" (who resemble Sudanese and Somalis in appearance).  Around 3100 BC, Upper Egypt expanded northwards and conquered Lower Egypt, creating the unified kingdom of Egypt. The first dynasty were Upper Egyptians (i.e. black ""Nubians"") but many later dynasties were from Lower Egypt (i.e. brown ""Middle-Easterners"").  In other words, the idea that Egyptians were just a single ""race"" (whether ""black"" or ""Middle-Eastern"") is a myth. Egypt was, in fact, the world's first multi-ethnic, ""multi-racial"" civilization. And over time, both Upper and Lower Egyptians eventually merged into a single Egyptian identity. As a result, we see wall paintings where Egyptians clearly distinguish themselves from their neighbours, lighter than Nubians but darker than Syrians & Lybians.  Another myth is the idea that modern Egyptians are Arab invaders, which is nonsense. In Roman Egypt, there are hundreds of Fayyum mummy paintings demonstrating that Egyptians in Roman times looked hardly any different to Egyptians today, centuries before any Arabs went to Egypt. And those Fayyum mummies are genetically similar to both ancient Egyptians in Ramses' time and modern Egyptians today. The majority of Egyptians today are mostly descended from ancient Lower Egyptians, while Egypt's Nubian minority today are mostly descended from ancient Upper Egyptians.  However, one thing we can agree on is that there were, most definitely, no white-skinned Egyptians in ancient times. The only ""white people"" in Egypt at the time of Ramses would have been a very small number of Greek ""Sea Peoples"" whose presence in Egypt was mostly limited to being either slaves or pirates, i.e. among the lower classes. The only time Greeks ever became Pharaohs was after Alexander's conquest a thousand years after Ramses. However, the genetic contribution of both Greeks and Arabs to the modern Egyptian gene pool was very small, and mostly limited to a few major cities, like Cairo and Alexandria.",1,0,Fire Water,mZPMU9riKl4,0.059634551495016584,2014-12-17 06:44:14,False,True

2015-01-10T23:44:20,"RIDLEY SCOTT – EXODUS GODS AND KINGS– 2014  First of all, for a remake, it is rather well done because the director decided to get rid of the most obvious unrealistic elements. To be short on the subject he got rid of all the static scenes like the waiting of the Jews to start for their migration outside the city, the never ending wait for Moses to come back down with the tables, the golden calf and the breaking of the tables, etc.   Then he tried to make things slightly more realistic, including with an Egyptian doctor explaining us how the various plagues are nothing but a processing phenomenon: a rebellion of crocodile make the river bloody and kills the fish that rot away bringing crop failure, worms and flies and then some kind of skin infections. But he finally had to come to less natural things: the locusts, well maybe, but then the hail in the storm became frankly iffy, and the final touch of the death of the first born was desperately mysterious and then we reached at this moment the problem of faith.  The escape sounds more logical in a way but the crossing of the sea was of course not explainable. We knew there was a ford but Moses goofed and took the road he did not know so that he did not come to the ford. Then we had to believe the water went down all by itself and then the tsunami was natural. Once again we came across the necessity to believe.   The alternative is of course to take this film as an action film. I must say Scott did a pretty job thanks to some very hard scenes like the hanging of hostages every day. But then one question comes up. The Hebrews or Jews had been slaves in Egypt for four hundred years. That brings us back around 2000 years BEFORE our era. So how did these Jews become slaves in Egypt since Judaism did not exist yet since Moses had not intervened with their fate yet? Were they Jews before Judaism or did they invent Judaism in slavery? Where did they come from anyway?   But most of all this film is speaking to us directly in the situation we have been living in for some 15 years now, at least. This world, I mean the western world as confronted to the rest of the world and particularly the Muslim world, has been managing the three main religions of our times, the three religions that were born in the Middle East from Semitic traditions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, by imposing secularism to them all, the French going a lot farther than the English or the Germans. As long as we do not recognize the people around us as equal in the totality of their existential personalities, including their religions we are pushing them into some kind of mobilization against this secularism and hence against the norms of the west.  In France we became hysterical about “marriage for all” which excludes by the way any other solution than marriage: “everyone has to get married” is implied, and that formula was there to cover same sex marriage or gay marriage. Not to use the word gay or homosexual they got into that phrase and that provoked the Christians mostly into demonstrating for “A family for everyone.” In the same way anti-Semitism and the obligation for Jews not to show their religion in public places like schools, hospitals or social services, some are moving towards emigrating and becoming extreme Zionists. In the same way finally the Muslims being ordered to hide their religious heritage away from all public places including streets and train stations they are pushed into becoming fundamentalists.   If you negate the essence of a person, that person is going to move towards those who are acknowledging that essence, recognizing it and even valorizing it.  That is shown so well in the film. The Jews are refused basic recognition and humanity as Jews since they are not Egyptians and they are slaves (where did they come from?), then they will support any extreme action, be it from some men or from God. You may say “shibboleth since God does not exist,” like the French extreme secular supporters pretend. Then we saw this week the result in Paris (remember 01/07-08-09/14, and there is no reason for not more to come.   Fundamentalist secularists are just as dangerous as the fundamentalists of any religion because that extreme secularism is a fundamentalist religion, end the worst of them all since it has no God. In France they have “republican values.” What’s that frankly apart from “secularism” + “sexual multi-orientation for everyone”?

Invent not a lie against Allah, lest He should destroy you completely by a torment. And surely, he who invents a lie (against Allah) will fail miserably.""	 62	Then they debated with one another what they must do, and they kept their talk secret.	 63	They said: ""Verily! These are two magicians. Their object is to drive you out from your land with magic, and overcome your chiefs and nobles.	 64	""So devise your plot, and then assemble in line.

That which they have made is only a magicians trick, and the magician will never be successful, no matter whatever amount (of skill) he may attain.""	 70	So the magicians fell down prostrate. They said: ""We believe in the Lord of Haroon (Aaron) and Moosa (Moses).""	 71	(Firaun (Pharaoh)) said: ""Believe you in him (Moosa (Moses)) before I give you permission? Verily! He is your chief who taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you on the trunks of date-palms, and you shall surely know which of us (I (Firaun Pharaoh) or the Lord of Moosa (Moses) (Allah)) can give the severe and more lasting torment.""	 72	They said: ""We prefer you not over the clear signs that have come to us, and to Him (Allah) Who created us. So decree whatever you desire to decree, for you can only decree (regarding) this life of the world.	 73	""Verily! We have believed in our Lord, that He may forgive us our faults, and the magic to which you did compel us.
