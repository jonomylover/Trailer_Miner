2016-11-13T11:25:00,From the looks of it the action looks good and if anything it will be entertaining. Will it be better that the original 95 movie probably not. It looks very inconsistent with the source material (and I have no idea why since it was already a master piece) and that will most likely prove its dislike among original fans such as myself and even other anime lovers but like I said if anything it should at least be entertaining.   Its funny I had an argument with someone a while back when the first really short trailer came out and he argued that it was based off of stand alone complex but its clearly more structured around the 95 movie. I highly recommend watching the original as I think it will prove much more than this but meh do what you please.,0,0,Jarom,G4VmJcZR0Yg,0.23,2016-11-13 11:25:00,True,True

Kusanagi has always known her past.  Yes, she doubted it a little once, in one scene, in the first movie, but she still knew who she was, past or no past.  And her being the first?  That takes away from the entire plot point of her being generic and using a common body for her own.  It's her doubting her identity because so many others have the same external shells.  In the series this was updated to her having a specifically important watch because it was an external memory device; something she comments that many cyborgs rely on.  And the soundtrack is miserable.  Couldn't they get Kenji Kawai to work on it to make it as amazing as the original?

In the original manga upon which the movie and all other subsequent versions are based, Motoko/The Major is stated as preferring European (i.e. Caucasian) bodies. This is a fact backed up by Shirow Masamune, The Series Creator, in the appendices of said manga and multiple interviews. So this isn't just a case of her being drawn to look European due to some artistic stylization and giving her a mukokuseki (stateless) appearance that is popular in manga and anime. It's due to The Major herself being mukokuseki/stateless. This is coming from someone who has had Ming Na Wen cast as The Major since 1997 or 98.

While some scenes are taken from the animation such as the water scene it seems that they made up own stuff a bit too much. (be advised I have not yet seen the complete series) As I recall Major was nothing fancy as 'The first' that would indicate she is the chosen one but she was simply one of many who developed to become more of a philosopher.   The invisibility was nothing built in to her body which seems to be the case in this trailer but rather a technology using a specific type of cloth. The Major and Batou had a long relationship even at the start of the animation and that is why they has such trust in each other in the trailer it is indicated that Batou is newly created.   This movie would do good to copy as much as possible from the animation not go their own way with things.

2016-11-13T12:48:03,"I feel like I shouldn't like this, because ""Hollywood only cares about the masses, they don't respect source material, etc."" But, as a fan of the GiTS franchise, I'm liking this so far. The issue with live-action movies based on anime is that usually the japanese studios don't have a big budget, so the CGI ends up sloppy-looking, and not enough money and time goes into casting and writing as it should. So Hollywood, with a much bigger budget, can improve on some of these issues. For example, the CGI looks beautiful in this trailer, (which is important in a cyber-punk world like GiTS's) and I, personally, like Scarlett's performance until now (as a side note, it can't be considered white-washing if the character isn't even Japanese in the first place). Don't get me wrong though. These are all PERSONAL OPINIONS based on solely THE TRAILER. So, the movie can still be crap. But I won't call it shit just now. I'll wait and see.

I love watching anime with English subtitles it's how it is meant to be watched god damn it.  This is soooooooooooooo disappointing no matter how visually beautiful the movie is.  This movie would have been received 10x better if they used a Japanese cast.  I would have gone to see this in the movie theater especially if it was Japanese language with English subtitles (a true foreign film).  Instead I'll wait until it's available from Redbox or Netflix.

I think that the choice of lead actress is just better fit for this purpose of injecting these ideas for rumination and conversation in the western world.   Still, I think it's a shame that this movie was not made with an Asian lead actress, keeping to the original story and setting.

I know fans such as myself want this film adaptation of Ghost in the Shell to have the same look and feel of the original animated film, judging from the trailer it does a very good job.

However I still get this weird vibe from Scarlett's acting. Not in a ""OMG they should've cast an asian actor OMG"" rage fit, I'm trying to move away from that so I can more fairly judge this movie. It feels a little awkward, like they could've placed slightly more humanity behind her words. I get it, she's a robot, but even in the manga and anime the Major had at least a little sense of humor despite the fact she never even blinked.

It is a racist suggestion that there aren't incredibly talented actors and actresses of every race and it's insulting to my intelligence if you expect me to believe the only motivation here isn't money. They just want to trade in on Johansson's fame, despite the fact that numerous actors of color have demonstrated that they can play leads in films that go on to be wildly profitable.

And the producers should be very aware of the fact that, using so much original material (scenery/story) will inevitably make people compare. And if your movie looks worse than what was produced 1995, you know you're not doing it right, right? So I feel disgust because they handled a lot of the sourcematerial worse than the anime movies/series. And with the animes handrendering technics, especially of the first movie, they had it a lot harder to control the visuals then the CGI nowadays. Yet composition and detail looks partially worse than in 1995. And I am also worried. They seem to try to cramp far too much material into one story, which was used for many different storylines over years, instead of focusing more of their energy into less, to creat truly perfect scenery and story. I'd rather watch a shorter good movie than a longer worse one. Lets see how this all turns out. But I would keep my hopes low, to not suffer even more dissapointment.  Some feelings I felt while watching: 1. Major leaps from the tower (yes yes yes!!), breaks the window and jumps into the room (wait what?!). Really really hope these where footage from 2 different scenes.  2. CGI and movement of the major are lacking the grace, beauty and fluidity. This is an action SciFi, please use budget where it matters. 3. From a realistic perspective, Robo-Geishas should be stunningly beautiful, but they made them just look like cool robots, defeating the purpose of them being Gaishas in the first place. From an artistic standpoint, the contrast between the beauty of traditional Geishas and the technical, cold complexity of advanced machinery is what makes Robo-Geishas so great in my eyes. 4. The scenery of the normal streets lack the overcrowded details of the original, makes the scenery feel somewhat empty for me. 5.

2016-11-13T16:02:11,"scarlett johansson looks good for the role but I dont think the atmosphere really captures the original too well. It does not seem CYBERPUNK as much.. just kinda looks like a modern city with unnecessarily large holograms  with couple random avant garde fashion people in the streets or something. Seriously they just took a video of today's everyday streets and just threw in some floating koi fish and thats it. I expected more dystopian cyberpunk city in a night setting and more mechs with hundreds of different immaculately moving parts. And more WIRES, TONS and TONS of looping and spiraling wires connected to body parts which pretty much defines the gritty look of ghost in the shell. They did have little bit of that with the monks at the end but WTF? Just ONE wire for each person? There should be at least 10 wires or something. Man, that just looks shallow. It doesnt even have a spider tank probably because CG team could not dare to manage it. They really did not make this look good even with the original that had amazing visuals to use as reference.  I said scarlet johansson looked good for the Kusanagi role but when she said ""maybe next time you can design me better"", her delivery was very weak. Kusanagi Motoko is very strong character and stern soldier. I can think of several better way of her saying something like that. She is also capable of extremely sophisticated acrobatic moves(cyborg and all) but all you really get in this video is typical asf slow motion wall running.. She also looks like shes just wearing a nylon tights btw. Why remake a 3D movie out of it if 2D original looks so much better?

Listen, I acknowledge that there‚Äôs a huge lack of Asian representation in Hollywood but this isn‚Äôt the movie to scream ‚Äúwhitewashing‚Äù about. Hollywood is a business, and they need to make a profit. Ghost In the Shell is a FRINGE anime whose core fanbase is not big enough to justify the multi-million dollar budget this film has. The studio had to hire an A-List star to draw in the general public, people who never heard of anime in their entire life.   We can‚Äôt have it both ways. Either they cast an unknown Asian actor and create a low budget indie movie (which would be horrible for this particular franchise) or cast a movie star and give this adaptation the budget it deserves. The latter option is a win/win for fans and the movie studio, who need a return on their investment.   We need to hold Hollywood accountable for not casting Asian actors in everyday tv shows and movies.

Anyone who says the characters' races don't matter cause their cyborgs wasn't paying attention to all the political subtext and commentary in SAC series.   Finally they are episodes in ghost in the shell where they meet  Caucasian  Americans and they look different from Motoko.  This proves at the VERY LEAST she isn't Caucasian.  ""But but, scarlett johansson is a box office success thats why she was casted""  WRONG, the producers wanted Margot Robbie but she was filming tarzan and was booked with suicide squad.   ""She wasn't white in the anime""  Actually she was, and in Arise you can very briefly see her parents.   ""WHAT difference does it make""  well she works for a Top Secret Japanese Government agency,  Walking around looking like a Caucasian american women isn't the best disguise.     ""But Japan makes our movies with ALL JAPANESE CAST, Are they racist!""  Well I can't speak for japan, but in here in the U.S. we are a melting pot.

2016-11-13T18:01:53,"I like how all of these people criticizing Scarlett Johansson as The Major simply don't understand how movies work.   Hollywood movies are all about making money. It's a business. If you make a movie based off of an anime film which isn't very well known in the U.S., use Japanese actors and actresses who aren't very well known, and expect the movie to make money, you're going to have a bad time.  Ghost in the Shell isn't Star Wars. You can't throw in actors that no one knows and get people to see it based off of the name alone. So, the only other thing you can do to get people to take notice of the film is to hire an A-list actress to take on the main role. Scarlett Johansson is the reason people who don't know what Ghost in the Shell is will see this movie. She's proven she can take on badass female leads, which The Major definitely is.   Besides, what makes The Major Japanese, aside from her name (Motoko Kusanagi)? She's a cyborg. She could have looked like anyone, of any ethnicity. In the original movie, she doesn't even look particularly Japanese. And her ethnicity, realistically, is irrelevant to the plot of the original movie. The movie could have taken place in any major city of the world, as long as the themes of identity and human interaction with technology were still present.  So, to everyone claiming whitewashing and all that bullshit, do some research into how Hollywood operates and stop spouting your idiocy. If there was an A-list Japanese actress who was ignored for Johansson, then you would have a point, but that's simply not the case.",5,0,Toaster Child,G4VmJcZR0Yg,-0.004333333333333327,2016-11-13 18:01:53,True,True

She has a real sense of humor about herself and the rest of her team,  she was NOT a broody Mary Sue. GitS isn't about Major Kusanagi it's about the society of future japan, and where things go from black and white to grey, and making her the entire focus of the movie doesn't make any sense.

These western adaptations of eastern anime never work out, but you gotta at least appreciate the effort on display here.  I think this movie has a little too much of that ""summer blockbuster"" feel to it when Ghost in the Shell is supposed to be a deliberate and intelligent story peppered with the occasional grand action scene.  Anyway, it remains to be seen, but I hope this is good.  It looks like it could be.  P.S. I'm not sure if Scarlett Johansson was right for this role.  The Major is supposed to be a very confident and strong person, but Scarlett gives off a stoic and soft demeanor.  Watching the anime, The Major is like the most capable and intelligent operator in Section 9, and instantly gives off a lasting impression being such a well-rounded female lead character.  I fear that aspect of her character is lost in this casting, which is a shame, because Motoko (The Major) is one of the most endearing female characters in anime.",0,0,YZ,G4VmJcZR0Yg,0.21063492063492065,2016-11-13 18:49:51,True,True

2016-11-13T19:05:07,When it comes to anime how do you people even know if the character is japanese? Just because in the anime it's  voicing is japanese or just because the anime is created by Japanese doesn't mean the character is Japanese.  For example i can tell what the character is if it's like Dante from Devil May Cry. Dante is not japanese. He is American looking type and is a demon. Like just because they speak japanese in the anime or the anime is created by Japanese doesn't mean the character is Japanese. Like Ken from Street Fighter he is American and he is white. He's from USA but so many people thinks he's Japanese just because in the anime he spoke Japanese. Also just because he went to Japan and just because the anime is japanese.,0,0,Midnightroar,G4VmJcZR0Yg,-0.007352941176470588,2016-11-13 19:05:07,True,True

And being that guy who has all of that behind his shoulders is like being the worst critic for this upcoming adaptation, especially considering the fact that the story needed no adaptatio sincen the 1995 movie in itself is a fricking masterpiece that'll blow you away. I've said to myself that I should try to put off the scepticism till I see it of course because I still kind of had hopes for the adaptation...Buuut that was back when we only had those small teasers, when I saw this trailer I kind of figured out what this actually will be  - a Hollywood action flick with a bland plot that just took some cool concepts from the original story.

It is exalted in a way that we, the humanity, have evolved into higher state of conscience and no longer care about such petty things like race (though new problems arose). That is why i like this series (aside the obvious reasons), it make me think that we are capable of higher things. And then i see animals fighting over race and physical appearance.

There are more examples of ""white roles"" being portrayed by other nationalities than any others.

2016-11-13T20:46:35,"One thing I really liked about the original was that it dealt with very philosophical issues. For example, there was a part where the villain (a very advanced AI) demanded asylum because it was a sentient entity. Somebody barked ""You're not! You're just a self preserving program!"". To which it replied ""By that rationale, I submit that your DNA is nothing more than a self-preserving program"". That made me go ""Oh wow, it has a point!"". It actually made me think whether we are, in essence, just a very advanced computer program, which is a disturbing thought because I've always thought of computer programs as being very ""limited"", whereas I envision us humans as being superior because we have choice and free will to do what we want. But what if that's not the case, and what if the AI is right? That we're just like a computer program, and we don't really have choice or free will, that we're limited by our DNA just like the AI is limited by its programming? And if the AI is right, then how long before we create an AI that's so advanced that it would become morally unacceptable to simply shut it off because it's just too aware of itself? I think that was the unique thing about the movie, that it actually made me think. Whereas I can just turn my brain off and enjoy most movies, this one actually made me stop and ponder about, you know, life in general. I'm not getting that vibe from this movie as of yet.

What I don't like is the shitty cgi, the fact that they mixed scene copied 1-to-1 as they were in the anime (why a movie has to looks like an anime?) with the usual stuff from hollywood blockbusters (lesbo kiss?

2016-11-14T01:33:54,"The focus seems more on the ""intrigue""' where Major come from, what the bad guys know she doesnt about the corporation that made her, etc. The original was more about the soul in a world of machine, the connexion between being, than about the ""intrigue"" itself. It was more a japanese theme, now we are more into typical Hollywood intrigue. Plus, Major was had a ambiguous ethnic look somewhere between Asian and Occidental, but Scarlett is 100% American looking. And Major was androgynous (except for the big boobs), she had strong muscular features in the anime (androgyneity is another strong theme in japanese animations along with occidental/oriental ambiguity), here she is the embodiement of american white feminity (i love Scarlett, but not the right casting)  Honestly, i am afraid Hollywood will lost the ""Ghost"" of this story, it soul, in favor to something more watchable for American public. But its hard to say for sure with a 2 minutes trailer. It could be that they focused on these aspects in the trailer to attract peoples and the film itself will have less white washing and will stay closer to the original spirit than this preview seem to let us know.    In short, the preview show a superficial recreation of the ""shell"" of the original with cute looking exotic imagery, but not of the ""ghost""",0,0,Lou M,G4VmJcZR0Yg,0.14823179271708686,2016-11-14 01:33:54,True,True

Seriously. Batou is too short and not muscular enough. They take the focus off of ""what is the soul"" and focus more on what Motoko is vs the general populace. Taking scenes from the 1995 film is nice, but loses its impact if you don't take every scene. Take all or take none. The ""love"" story between Batou and Motoko shouldn't kick in for a long while. Motoko doesn't start questioning her past for a while. Don't try to cram 2 seasons and 3 movies into one film.

2016-11-14T08:42:57,"PLEASE enough about the Asian actress thing. üòë If you know the original movie, you know Major Kusanagi is drawn with a caucasian appearance, as are MANY main anime characters.  So much anime that is worth remembering has main characters drawn as 'white'.  The artists were Asian and that was their decision with their art.  Please, if you don't know classic Anime then you really shouldn't complain.  Go watch the original 1995 Ghost in the Shell PLEASE.. also Akira, Ninja Scroll, Patlabor, Vampire Hunter D, etc... get educated. ‚úì My biggest problem with this movie is the casting.  Scarlett is amazing in her own way but she's no Major.......  This movie doesn't need Scarlett.  It needs a physically perfect, somewhat absent faced SOLDIER.  The reason I watch the original again and again is because the Major kicks so much ass.  It's not her words that make me a fan.  It's her physicality.  Her strength.  Her top of the line BANGIN' Cyborg Body.  How Naive she is...  Scarlett is sultry.  We need a new face with the physicality of Adriana Lima combined with a top olympic athlete.  Such a huge disappointment from a huge fan like me.  üòîüòîüòî The other thing that scares me is the fact that some scenes in this trailer look almost IDENTICAL to scenes from the original Anime.  If you've seen the real life adaptation of ""Blood, The Last Vampire"" then you'll share with me in my fear of this being a let down...  Trying to replicate the exact Anime in a real life setting is kinda like eating reheated nachos.  It sucks.  Make new story lines and other kick ass settings.  That way we'll have nothing to compare it to.  I hope it's good.  I really do....  But if it sucks, as a huge fan of GITS....  I'll be pissed.  üçÄ",1,0,David Lee,G4VmJcZR0Yg,0.18164934225980744,2016-11-14 08:42:57,True,True

I'll get things thrown at me, but I don't like Scarlett Johansson in this role, or situation either.

2016-11-15T03:53:44,"It's a sad attempt by the so called ""fans"" who are not familiar with the Major's background to always bring up race when in the manga and anime her ethnicity was never disclosed. She can manifest herself into anything since she is an artificial intelligence with an artificial body but implanted with a human brain. ""Artificial body"" should give you a hint that she can look European, Japanese, African, or whatever ethnicity she chooses since she is now an artificial intelligence. In the anime she experiences plenty of near death scenarios to a point where her body is almost completely destroyed. She is brought back to life by her organization by fixing her all over again therefore, she can look different if her organization wishes by giving her another artificial body.   Masamune Shirow, the original author of the manga, indicated that the concept of GitS is global, meaning it is a story blended with Western and Japanese themes. The story was based on humanity's increasing reliance on the internet and technology, which is prevalent today. The advent of the internet in America, specifically Google, influenced the story and Masamune also researched studies from Japanese universities about technology's impact throughout the world therefore, the story is about humanity losing a sense of identity due to our reliance and obsession with technology.  Plus, I find it ironic when people say race when we are all human. What they mean is ethnicity. Either way, the Major has a dilemma about her identity, whether she is purely ai or human. In the anime she said she does not know if her memories are hers or from someone else since her brain was implanted.   However, she has grown so accustomed to her life as a cyborg agent owned by the Japanese government. Her body was manufactured by her organization so she is an important asset to them therefore, she lost her identity as a human when she had to undergo critical cybernetic enhancement as a very young child around the age of six.  Before anyone brings up her name being Motoko Kusanagi, well that does not automatically qualify her as being Japanese. My name is Christian Gonzales. People automatically assume that I am Hispanic when I am actually Filipino. I may be Filipino but I identify myself as American because I have never been nor grew up in the Philippines, so I don't know anything about their culture but America's. I have plenty of Korean friends who have names that don't sound like the culture of their ethnicity like Daniel Johnson or Michael Trenton. People come from all over the world so I would not be surprised to see an African or a European  with a Japanese name in Japan if they have breathe and lived the culture ever since they were born there.  Point is, the Major's ethnicity was never disclosed in the anime or manga but her race certainly was and that is maybe human (her human implanted brain) or maybe artificial intelligence. Also, there was the fact that as a child she had to undergo major cybernetic enhancement in order to live due to a life threatening accident.   The story is about her trying to find out her identity ever since she changed into an advanced cyborg.  Before you call me a bigot for supporting the whitewashing in the Hollywood film industry, of which there is, I don't see that applying in this setting. It is appropriate for someone like ScarJo to be casted in this story because she really pulls off the character of Major well. I am impressed by her performance so far, but I will reserve judgement about the film until it releases.   To reiterate, the Major is a character with a lost identity with a past of a human as a child but a current life of an artificial intelligence. She has a dual race as a  human and ai but an unknown ethnicity, and the story is not exclusively a Japanese concept but blended with Western and global influence.Ôªø",335,51,Chris,G4VmJcZR0Yg,-0.012414403778040149,2016-11-15 03:53:44,True,True

In the manga/anime, Kusanagi was more or less pulverised in an accident as a child, and she became a full body cyborg afterwards. She learned to control her cybernetics while her brain was still young and flexible, and the reason she is badass was not because ""[she] is the first of [her] kind!"", but more that she is a prodigious mind naturally at home in a military grade full body prosthesis. In the first episode of Stand Alone Complex, the plot revolved around someone masquerading as a Geisha-sexbot, putting their own brain inside the full body prosthesis of a prominent Japanese politician. When she herself was ""cyberized"", a fellow survivor of the plain crash agreed to the same a couple of days after she visited him in her new body.

Think about the money invested, commitment and work that everyone had to do to this movie come true and arrive to you... And after that, come some people to denigrate this without watch it... But the  life is this, the people are prejudiced (any opinion or feeling conceived without critical examination)...

2016-11-15T19:16:14,"I'm willing to give the movie a try. Honestly though, I'll be more surprised if it's actually good. Live action movies usually suck, so I'm hoping that they've at least done a decent job with this one. I'm always willing to give movies a chance--especially considering how much I love all the GitS anime, manga and guides. As far as saying most Japanese people don't care about the casting, that may or may not be true. I don't think that the opinions of few represent the opinions of many. So unless someone polls most or every single Japanese Ghost in the Shell fan in Japan, that statement is a bit hard to accept. Not saying it's right or wrong, but it really doesn't prove anything except for there are 'some' Japanese people who don't mind. Some might actually hate it, but they're less likely to complain about it since it's not anything pressing. It's just a movie. Also, Sam Yoshiba, a publisher at Kodansha, said he was fine with the Scarlett Johansson. As far as I know, the author/creator never stated that him self.  While I understand both sides of the argument, I also understand that this is an adaptation. Even the people over at Kondansha realized (and said) that since this was a Hollywood movie, they never even expected Motoko's actress to be Japanese. They never said she was or wasn't Japanese. Just that considering who was spearheading the movie, they didn't expect her to be. Take that statement as you'd like. Not saying anybody is wrong; to each their own.

2016-11-15T21:04:15,"Reposting from a Facebook post I made, so the formatting is kinda weird, but  Since this is apparently a lose adaptation of SAC:2nd GIG, I have no idea why they're recreating iconic scenes from the 1995 movie. Not to mention, there isn't nearly enough screen time to fully dedicate to the Individual Eleven, so it's strange that they're even featuring Kuze. The decision to give focus to the Major's backstory is also an odd one, considering that a broader understanding of the setting and the way that it relates to the sense of self is needed to appreciate her background as a whole. Not to mention, the notion that the Major could be the only one of anything is incredibly strange, considering that the usual GiTS overarching theme of questioning the self only holds up when ones body is no longer a subject of individuality.     It's also concerning that we don't see the rest of Section 9. While I can understand the exclusion of Pazu, Bouma, and Seito, I'm concerned that we don't see any of Togusa, considering how essential of a supporting character he is for most of SAC.     The action shots look incredibly un-GiTS like. Most of what made the Major a strong character was her ability to lead and command others, both during combat and out. She rarely fought alone (only twice in the 97 movie, and only around three times, give or take, in SAC), and she was never did crazy acrobatics. While this change is understandable in the context of Hollywood movie, more considerations should have been taken to accommodate for the tone of GiTS.",0,0,Dalton S,G4VmJcZR0Yg,0.09419642857142854,2016-11-15 21:04:15,True,True

2016-11-15T21:49:27,"Edit2**Hodoss expertly counters my ramblings here, so make sure to read his response and my response to him further down if you actually give two flips about these comments. It's interesting to see the diversity of opinion on something like this!  Call me a ""SJW"" if you want, but I have a huge issue with whitewashing.  I'm a pretty race neutral kinda guy, I'm cool with anyone doing whatever and think racial ""roles"" are bullshit (ie music genres unbound by race, using whatever language you wish, adopting cultural customs from anywhere, etc.).  But why take an East Asian character and cast a white woman for it (who I will mention costs a pretty penny, Johannson isn't a C-Lister) when Hollywood and other film centers are filled to the brim with young Asian actors willing to do a role for cheaper to get their foot in the door in a massive way?   Why is everyone except Takeshi Kotano also whitewashed?  There's a case to be made for Bollywood adaptations not featuring actors of other races, because while India is ethnically diverse it is not so racially diverse.  Hollywood however is not Bollywood, it's a district of one of the most ethnically and racially diverse cities in one of the most diverse states in all of America.  I don't think there's malicious intent, like some cuckoos, but I think Hollywood and producers need to dig their heads out of their ass and realize there's more to film than just their usual recruiting pool.  People have argued that since the story of the Major and the film overall is a very universal one, that race does not factor into it.  That is also a perfectly reasonable argument, so don't take me as someone who's choosing a ""side"".  Besides that, this trailer bugs me on another level.  It's taking scenes from the 1995 film, so I assume it is a remake of the original film and maybe parts of GitS 2.0: Innocence and not Standalone Complex or Arise.  If that's the case, then why is it focusing so much on the Major's background?  1995 never really focused on where Kusanagi came from, it instead grappled with where she was going, what the new world and relationships between beings was like, even just the question of the nature of consciousness to begin with.  It was action-heavy, but it took time to focus on the internal narratives of each character or conflict in stride rather than just as a background to throw action scenes over.  The boat scene between Batou, the discovery of the Ghost,  the showdown, the epilogue conversation;  these were all narrative-crucial parts of 1995, and from this trailer I get none of that.  If the producers wanted to stay faithful to the original, why not take a more daring approach and leave us with questions?  Or hell, just pull a Full Metal Jacket trailer and distill your entire movie into a few frames and quotes?  As it stands, I know what this looks like: Robocop.  It looks like anime Robocop, and not the good one, the remake that was just meh.*  Whatever, I've spent way too much time thinking about a dumb adaptation I probably won't see unless it gets good reviews or an anime-fan friend of mine recommends.  Just my two cents.  *Looking at it closer, I think it's more likely an adaptation of the original manga, so there's more material there to be adapted.

Major accepts who and what she is because she has no choice and cannot change it.

No one in real life has a triangle for a nose, eyes that huge, or natural purple/blue/green etc hair. The medium values simplicity for faces. Simply that.  I'm Asian and I think ScarJo is a great choice. Besides her being white being totally plausible within GITS' plot, here's another good reason. This movie cost a fortune to make. You need an A list actor that can make up the money used to make this movie just by her name and there are NO A-list Asian actresses. You think Hollywood is like ""lets hire a white person cuz we hate minority?"" NO. They arn't stupid. They know there will be backlash. Hollywood is a business. They respond to profit. If this movie succeeds =>  more anime films => more Asian themed films => more opportunity for Asian actors. You can't go from 0 to 100 just like that. I believe this is the first step in the right direction. They can't risk leaving this to any actor simply because she's Asian.   And here's another potential and unfortunate problem if she's asian. There are tentions between Japan, and China and Korea's government and a certain degree of racism between them (This is generalizing. Not saying all everyone hates each other) .  If she's not Japanese, (especially if the actor is Chinese) that's a huge major spit in the face to Japan, the origin of Gits. It will alienate Gits ""original"" audiences, limiting the search pool even further.

No, not because she's white, but for two reasons: One, Scarlett, in my opinion, is too famous. I think it would play better to bring in a relatively 'unknown' actress. All I see is Black Widow parading around as Motoko. I get it that production wants to draw in new viewers to the GIS franchise with a popular name, and I hope it works that way for them. Second, Scarlett, as fine an actress as she is, seems to me to have a perpetual 'dazed and confused' look about her, where Motoko always appears  (even in her moments of severe angst) sharp and focused. Batou in this clip looks comedic. I do hope the Tachikomas make an appearance, along with, maybe one of those HAW tanks.  Bottom line is, I didn't make this movie.

2016-11-16T18:32:27,"Look i understand everyone has made the argument that Motoko isn't asian, that her model is ethnically ambiguous, Japan is okay with it, that ScarJo is perfect for the role simply because she's ScarJo, or that she looks white in the anime. But hear me out plz lol  1. Argument: Motoko's supposedly isn't asian because ""the creators"" didn't intend for her to be a certain ethnicity and that she's ethnically ambiguous.  Rebuttal: okay just because someone is described as ""ethnically ambiguous"" doesn't equal white. Her name is Motoko Kusanagi or as some ppl say is her alias, but that is her name nonetheless. No one knows her past and that leaves it up to interpretation and creative freedom. SO getting an asian actress like Rinko Kikuchi (Pacific Rim) isn't far fetched. She would've been a way better casting choice in my opinion than ScarJo. This story is a very Japanese one as it deals with Japan's close association with technology and how far ur humanity goes when ur fully cybernated. also they are deliberately not straying away from the asian aesthetic. If her model is supposed to be western then how the hell is she supposed to blend in looking whiter than a snowflake?  2. Argument: Japan is okay with it.  Rebuttal: This isn't a valid argument because it's like asking how Africans feel about racism towards African-Americans in America. Their answer wouldn't have the same perspective as African-Americans. Japan, a country where there isn't much immigration and they really try not to and where they have a homogeneous society, where if a Japanese person in Japan turns on their tv what do they see? more Japanese ppl. Japanese ppl don't really understand the concept of racism or whitewashing because they never had to deal with it. we (the us) have one of the most diverse populations in the world and hollywood obviously doesn't get it. they think casting the supporting cast with different ethnic groups checks off the diversity requirement and reserving the lead role for a white actor is ideal. I mean the guy playing Ishikawa is Australian! What the hell? im sorry. we have the diversity that other parts of the world don't and its about time Hollywood started using that and representing that properly. Its also kind of sad because guess what? ppl outside the us, sees the face of America as white. so who else would they expect to fill the roles of an American Ghost in The Shell? And its sucks.  3. Argument: ScarJo is perfect because its ScarJo and she make da money.  Rebuttal: The star power myth isn't really true. nobody knew chris hemsworth before thor, nobody knew jennifer lawrence before hunger games, nobody knew Rinko Kikuchi or Charlie Hunnam before Pacific Rim, nobody knew Henry Cavill before Man of Steel or Immortals, nobody knew Aaron Taylor before Kick Ass, nobody knew any of the ppl in the Last Airbender movie (i know it was bad) but that's the point....shall I go on? Ppl are going to see the ghost in the shell simply because its ghost in the shell not because of ScarJo. And secret: ""not everyone likes ScarJo"".  4. Argument: She looks white in the anime.  Rebuttal: have any of u seen anime? By that argument then everyone looks white! The key is that animated characters are perceived to be how u want them to be. How do u know if the Simpsons are about a white family? they're yellow. i could make the argument that they look canadian or latino for all we know. just because they look white to u doesn't mean they are. Also if u watch Anime they deliberately makes it clear to u that someone is foreign: blonde hair, blue eyes, telling u they're mixed, and also a funny accent when speaking Japanese.",4,1,LYRADdl,G4VmJcZR0Yg,0.09453463203463203,2016-11-16 18:32:27,True,True

2016-11-16T19:06:15,"For the people saying ""they never specified her ethnicity"" and ""she's a cyborg""..  I wouldn't think you would need to specify ethnicity in an ANIME/MANGA,  especially when her name is ""Motoko Kusanagi"" and it takes place in JAPAN  (a place which 98% of people are indeed Japanese). In fact when they do specify ethnicity or race in an anime it's usually to let the audience know that they AREN'T of Japanese descent.   ***Most importantly to end this debate, she was supposed to be a generic looking model made to look inconspicuous and be able to blend into crowds so WHY WOULD SHE NOT BE MADE TO LOOK LIKE ALL THE OTHER JAPANESE PEOPLE IN THE CROWD??!?!?!?!  Would it really kill Hollywood to let an Asian-American play a lead role in a big film? When was the last time you saw an Asian play a lead role in a big American film (that wasn't a martial arts movie). People aren't ""fake mad"" just because of this role but at the fact that Asian-Americans are widely underrepresented in American film.  We all know they are casting a white person with a brand name to increase box office gross, which is understandable because at the end of the day money drives the world, but let's not pretend it's not white-washing.

Simply because 'd love to see a Japanese actress have the main role for once and  the story comes from Japan, afterall. And at the same time, I think that thanks to ScarJo, the movie will have a better media coverage. Could have been the big reveal of an actress but that's only if people were interested enough to go see a movie adaptation of a manga/anime with an unknown cast... Gotta say, ScarJo's very stolid acting kinda fits the character from the 1995 animated movie (which is really different from the original manga character). So it was a bargain on the producer's side, you know. It's also part of the success of a movie, I guess.

2016-11-17T06:47:32,"To what I see in the trailer they clearly missed the point what Masamune Shirow wanted to show in Ghost in the Shell. It looks like a typical holywood  action movie set in the future, with some kind of ""they stole your identity"" or ""bad guys are actually good"" plot twist, while the actual story of Ghost in the shell is about the definition  of having a soul (=Ghost) in an artificial body (=Shell) the contradiction in opposite manners and the value of a body (artificial or biological) to its soul or vice versa. Thats why its called: Ghost (your soul) in the Shell (the body). It goes far beyond some shooting scene and future backgrounds.   The trailer gives me the impression, that they poorly executed the plot from the original story and simply took the settings to advertise their movie creating something for the ""mass"". Yet again I do not think the movie has to be bad. Moreover I would say that the movie should not be called Ghost in the Shell  (as far my assumptions are correct) but simply ""inspired"" by what Masamune did.

2016-11-17T07:26:45,"They pretty much changed the plot big time and totally lost the main ""plot"" of Ghost in the Shell (Ghost in the Machine -Arthur Koestler). The story was never about Kusanagi Motoko being a first of her kind. And it was also never about her trying to find her true identity because she already knew who she was. Also looking at the Trailer, they seem to have mashed up action scenes from both the 1995 Movie, and the TV series GITS:Stand Alone Complex (The intro where she jumped off from 1995 GITS and the android dolls taking diners as hostages from GITS Stand Alone Complex)... I highly doubt this live action can be as good as the Animation movies/series. If anything perhaps 20%-30% as good. The feel of the show (base on the trailer) is also dead since they started using their over sponsored shit music and not the one's Gabriela Robin uses (a.k.a. Yoko Kanno).  The main issue with creating a live action of an Animation such as Ghost in the Shell that have spawned several Movies, OVA's and Series that are very successful on their own is that the Bar was set very high by the Animations alone which is hard to beat. Specially harder to beat when you make a live action that have a big change in plot, mis-cast the characters and many more.  Unlike an example..  the  Manga and Novel ""All you need is kill"" it was a Manga and Novel that was not as well known as Ghost in the Shell, it was not animated even.. It was easy to make a movie out of it and become successful Without so much critics cause it was relatively not well known to many manga and Novel readers (I have read thousand's of manga titles  and I never heard of that manga until I finished watching Edge of Tomorrow.. that's how relatively Unknown that manga really is...). The ""Manga and Novel All you Need is kill"" = Live action movie is called ""Edge of Tomorrow/Live-Die-Repeat"".  But ye, for this Movie to be successful. They have to produce something that can be on par or overpass the quality the 1995 movie possess (but I don't think they can...) Unlike Edge of Tomorrow which proved to be very successful.   Even Edge of Tomorrow did not 100% Follow the ""All You Need is Kill"" Manga and Novel faithfully, it had a heavily westernised casting, and a lot of things were changed in the story. But it was successful nonetheless cause that particular manga and Novel was not that well known/mainstream unlike Ghost in the Shell which is more popular and have high scores on the Animated Movie and Series (which this live action movie have to beat or say atleast get 50% as good). Either its going to be a flop or its the typical Hollywood Influence thing where it only gained huge box office cause a lot of people watched it = Mostly people who have no idea what Ghost in the Shell is and have yet to watch the Ghost in the Shell 1995 or the Series (Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex Season 1 and 2, GITS:Innocence and many more).  I would say, if you plan on watching this live action, go watch the Ghost in the Shell 1995 atleast and perhaps Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex Season 1 and 2 as well. And then Watch this trailer again. See the huge difference. (Just saying :P).",80,18,T-K-,G4VmJcZR0Yg,0.21698760330578512,2016-11-17 07:26:45,True,True

2016-11-17T08:26:14,"I sincerely hope that the details and the premise of the anime are upheld in this remake. The original film detailed some interesting revelations about the interface between humans and machines. Cybernetics, and consciousness, the defining characteristics on that field being moral dilemmas, and whose ultimate responsibility it was, the unsettling answer being that no one or thing knew.   That's what made this film, and the subsequent series so comforting to watch, as, such issues are present today, in our everyday lives, yet we are unable to observe their effects on us as a beings living out of our mental projections, only within the mental framework of a dystopian future are we able to pick objectively at our own immortality. The answer once again, being that noone or thing has control, and this idea is made all the more startling when observed in the mind of a machine.   The ideas behind the movie reference many an important philosophy, but, I think scientifically, as we stand today, theoretical neuroscience (a ways forward) and its understanding of the mind as a, ultimately, and, as far as the main points about it go, a learning machine, that, can, become a caveat for any who look nonchalantly at a humble stone axe made millennia ago by a bird, and objectively rely on the idea of a non-sentient accumulation at work.

We all want a good movie so all we can do is hope that she can. I don't care what ethnicity that entails as long as they view the source material and do it right. Instead, as it's a Hollywood movie that has to explain a ton of things to not alienate non-GitS viewers, shouldn't we be more concerned that introducing, understanding and coming to a conclusion in a two-hour film surrounding the complexity of the GitS universe is going to be one hell of an tough-to-achieve task?",1,0,Locke107,G4VmJcZR0Yg,0.16607142857142856,2016-12-02 11:48:49,True,True

Also the second guy brave heroine shoots while ""wall running"" should've emptied like half of the magazine right in her wherever really, but screenwriters saved the day. - ""You were dying - we saved you"" cliche crap. - WTF with ""you are the first of your kind""!? In ""source materials"" - she got her full synth body when she was just a kid and by the time it happened, this sort of practice was already relatively common. And here you're trying to pitch it as if we're watching RoboCop. Also ""one of a kind"" cliche... - 1:25 - I'd start blaming screenwriters - Chief Aramaki took a gun in his hands like once in whole Ghost In The Shell animated movie/series and/or manga universes and here he takes out a death squad with just 6 shots... But it's Takeshi Kitano - what else would you expect?... - 1:30 - I'll just assume that you forgot to add the ""eye implants"" for Bato's character there.

It's like ""hey teen boys... look she's naked and kissing another girl... buy a damn ticket!"" While at the same time trying too hard to show iconic scenes from the original.  3) The original is one of my all time favorite anime. It was almost profetic in describing social media and how we will interact in the future. Major is a character that lets you explore that world. This however feels (at least the trailer made it seem that way) that her past will be an important plot point. That feels a little too clich√© and overdone, whereas the original was more about exploring a future world and what it means to be alive.  4) This is not to say the movie doesn't look appealing or that I'm not looking forward to it. I'm just saying from the trailer it looks like the makers are too focused on it's success and targeting audiences that I get a feel like some of what made the anime fun might be lost.

Also the Major is not the first full body prosthetic. As a matter of fact there are several of them even in the first movie.  Note: This part was made after watching the trailer.  The Major knows who she is! She didn't lose her past, theres a bit about becasue she lost her original body she feels like she's lost her original ghost but thats it.

At first I got quite hyped with the visual but then I heard the premisse for the Major's character: ""I'm looking for who I am"", ""I'm insecure, I don't know who to trust"". This sounded ridiculously shallow and cheesy. Really hope there is more depth to that.    They could have gone for many different approaches for the Major;   Oshii's: A dark slightly depressed but deep intelectual and introspective woman, clearly detached from her humanity but still with desires to dive deep into the mysteries of the new world she lives in and the nature of life.   Shirow's Original Major: A tough ""gorila babe"" with a sarcastic but wit sense of humor that fights for justice and has a difficult time getting herself a strong man that can handle her, so she still has some lesbian fun with some youger friends of hers. Much more like a young tough but humorous ""female detective"".   Or Kamiyama's Major: Kinda of a mix of the two, a mysterious extremely intelligent and talented character with a little bit of sarcasm spiced with no problem in showing her sexiness, still she wonders about the nature of the ghosts and her own identity but in her own mature adult away.  All three Majors share a common trait: She is a strong independent woman. THE LAST THING I'D EXPECT TO SEE IN MAJOR IS INSECURITY! Her identity crisis is that more of a mid aged woman, definetely NOT of an endgy insecure teenager.   That seems like a really shallow generic main character. Seems to me hollywood still can't take Japanese animation (and manga) seriously enough.

I know a lot of people complain that the major isn't being played by an Asian, but honestly, all ethnicity aside, Scarlet Johansson does seem like the right kind of person to play the major. Besides, one of the hole ideas from the original anime was that her character wasn't in her original body, but rather in a mass-produced assembly line body built by a big corporation, so I think it could still work with having Scarlet Johansson playing her, in terms of story and what not. The biggest thing that I don't like in this trailer is how Batou looks. He was one of my favorite characters from the original anime(in particular, the second anime film ""inesense""). I like the guy they got to play him, but His eye lenses are way too small and just look kind of weird the way they did them. Also there were some scenes where he had normal looking eyes in the trailer, which he never had in any of the anime versions. Hopefully the rest of the movie is adapted pretty faithfully. I looked up the ""shelling sequence"" scene which they did for this movie and it looked amazing! It was about as perfect as they could have adapted that scene. They even had the same music from the anime film. So I don't know. Hopefully this will be a good film.

The very  fact that we are going to see a classic Anime live action adaptation in  less than three months is ground breaking. Anime has fought hard to make  its way into pop culture. I remember visiting my local mall's Sundance  store. It was the only store that carried Anime. I also remember  becoming hooked on films like Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Venus Wars, and  Ninja Scroll. I found these films because some one chose to mention  them in a magazine or some other form of media I was into at the time.  And although I was too young to appreciate them fully, I became a fan.  Now fast forward to 2017 and we have a 150 million dollar adaptation of  one of these classics of the 90s. It's progress. It may not be 100% what  we want but its a start. If Anime are to be celebrated by the masses  you need to have mass appeal. Charlotte brings that to the table. No one  who is not a Geek of Anime or movies knows what this movie is. What  will bring them to theaters is their interest in the trailer and the  lead actress. If we can get them watching, then we can then more live  action Anime. And if we introduce more Anime we can begin casting more  Asian actors into the roles. Marvel is in the process of bringing comics  to the main stream in the same fashion. Who ever thought we would see  so many characters brought to life on the big screen. We have mainstream  audiences to thank for that, not just the enthusiast. One day I hope  comics will be considered accessible by everyone. And I also hope that  of Anime. So, I beg you, if you are fan of Anime please see this film.

Everyone else goes to see one movie over another because they like the actor/director, the trailer looks good, or it got good reviews. Scarlett Johansson has proven her top billing status and acting ability. That's why she was chosen for the role. If the only people that go see this movie are fanboys, it won't make enough for them to make another movie like this one. And if you look at the how the character looks in the anime, she looks just like her.   Making Shredder from TMNT William Fichner, I could understand those complaints because it completely changed the story. But this, c'mon.

Then we have underrated Pilou Asb√¶k supporting her, and he is rising a rising star in Game of Thrones, so I think he will do a great job in this as well. Furthermore, I rarely like the anime adaptions. Dragon Ball sucked, and Kickass was just about average.

Of course you are going to meet many at cultural centers or events which specifically cater to Western-descended people, as did I - but that is hardly representative of the whole.  A movie set in *modern-day* Japan where all the main characters are white would rightfully be laughed/booed out of the room for being terribly whitewashed as well as preposterous. No one would swallow the excuse that in the novel of manga source set in 2016 Tokyo it wasn't specified that the characters weren't all white, so they just might be all white.

But what I'm really interested in is if the plot will sort of fix the lose ends that the anime had. They were minor and practically didn't take away from the experience, but they were there. As for the whole 'discovering who I am' stuff, I don't know how that fits. I mean it was never fully clear if Major merged with the Puppeteer or not in the 1995 anime, but she knew who she was and what she lacked. Maybe they'll use the merge part (if it's in the movie) to tie in the 'discovery' plot. That is if there is a Puppeteer as the main villain and not the company who created her. (Which now thing about it, created the villain as well). Because of that they could make Major and the villain friend/enemies, but I don't know how I feel about that since they were never on the same side. The visuals are beautiful though and I""m liking how they stayed with her 'naked' costume. Sure a bit more white, but it seems to work, at least in the trailer. Here's hoping its actually good, because both anime and manga were awesome!

2017-02-11T21:42:20,"This may be all style and little substance. May be destined for the $3.99 bin at Best Buy. They are trying to make a niche movie into a mainstream movie meaning a dumbed down version with big stars, explosions, and too much slo mo. I think this idea would have come off better under a foreign studio which would focus more on the story and less on trying to make it a blockbuster. Now that Marvel and DC are starting to cool off, live action anime might be the new flavor. I also don't think Akira will come off well as a live action feature because of the fact that it is the art and not its bloated story that makes Akira stand out. When you talk to anyone about Akira, they talk about the animation, not the story. What makes anime like these great is the fact that they don't look real, but are extremely well drawn. It's this distance that makes them appealing. Live action will take away from the art and draw more attention to the story which is not bad if the stories are well written. But looking at how much money went into the look of this trailer I doubt that it's counterbalanced with a well written script.

Reading the comments it seems all the fanboys are getting their knickers in a twist that the main character isn't Asian but, in basic terms, had they cast a Japanese actress as opposed to an established A List actress, they may have struggled in their attempts to attract a wider audience and non-fanboys. At the end of the day, they want as many people to see and enjoy their film as possible as that directly correlates to increased profit. If they made a pure 100% carbon copy film from the source material this film may have only been watched by the for talk's sake 1 million fans of the anime.

2017-03-03T12:49:43,"""No no no, bad bad bad, wrong wrong wrong.""  I enjoy Miss Johansson as an actress but the Major is Japanese. So are Batou, Chief Aramaki, Togusa, Ichikawa and the Tachikoma. The setting is high-tech but there are many episodes that clearly state that the country is Japan. The relationship between technology and Section 9 is Japanese in a time when Japan was cutting-edge of the entire technological market. The Internet was a scary place in 1995 and the concept of the hackers was new and frightening. The manga debuted in 1989.   The Japanese name of this show is not ""Busty Skin-Suit Heroine"". It's ""Mobile Armored Riot Police"" and the Major heads up an elite police squad that even has trouble staying active among the legitimate police squad and military. They're the elite of the elite (Batou's an ex-ranger) and that's why they can afford cybernetic prosthetic upgrades. Section 9 willfully signs away their professional lives and all their time and the enhancements are a free perk for the commitment. Otherwise they're next to impossible to maintain. There is no amnesia plot in the series. Section 9 tracks Laughing Man in season one and handles Comrade Kuze in season two.  Go on KissAnime and watch the 1995 animated film (dubbed or subbed) before you say anything positive about this tripe. Kusanagi faces and merges with a superhacker and never gains amnesia. I couldn't even sit through this trailer. I stopped it after 36 seconds because seeing Miss Johansson in that outfit makes me want to claw out my eyes. Not only is she not Japanese; she is not Major Kusanagi.",0,0,Lexxy Snow,G4VmJcZR0Yg,-0.09284874608150472,2017-03-03 12:49:43,True,True

The trailer gives more of a crime action vibe than a psychological thriller and philosophical one. Though I do like how they've done the cyberpunk aspect in this.  The philosophy behind the original film was among the best aspects of it for me. The questions raised, the self-reflection and the deep discussions that took place. So many great things about the original and i'm more so wondering how they will carry it out in the film and whether it'll be as interesting, deep and thought provocative. So i'll reserve judgement until after i've seen it, otherwise i'm more cautious about it appearing more action-like than anything.

Probably to see how much of a roll out they're going to do or not or just to write the damn thing off.  What seems to be pretty clear from her review was that GIAS was all Shell and no Ghost basically. From what she was shown Alachua said that it seemed Scarlett's portrayal of the major was a miscast.

Lots of small things, like the facial expresion being mostly the same, not blinking, turning around with a mechanical movement, not as fluent as the human coworkers....

Following this train of thought we run into concepts that sum up descartes in it's entirety.   The very notion of ‚ÄúI think therefore I am‚Äù is the basis for Motoko‚Äôs reasoning. That she must be something however her reasoning takes it a step further.  Which denotes that memories are something that makes up an individual. So that while she may have artificial parts. She has memories that are unique to her.   While she seemingly has the free will of thought and decision. It is only given to her when she fulfills her purpose in the company. She aids in fighting criminal hackers within Section 9. But the moment she decides to give up fulfilling such a task she will be terminated. This also leads me full circle to the idea that our lives are shaped by death.   However the whole idea that Ghost in the Shell was a revenge story is a hack in itself.

You make me sad. The first anime movie, and sequence of series, along with the manga, it was all a masterpiece. Yes. This movie is a master piece. Literally IS the original animes and manga. The music too. The scenes are identical. The only 2 differences are 1) the spider tank is not Hanka red and 2) to be invisible she does not add a face cloth. Beside that EVERYTHING is identical. And enhanced by amazing computer graphic. I've been following Ghost In the Shell since 1996. Beside the music of Yoko Kanno ( unbeatable) from the series, this live action movie is spectacular and faithful. So quit bitching making a fool of yourself and go see it 3D IMAX if you can.

Totally payed respect to the original anime so for the idiots who just felt this need to boycott it because of this ""whitewash"" crap or whatever you call it, you missed out on a great movie. You missed out on a great movie because of your pettiness and inability to just focus on the movie rather than the color of the skin of the lead actress, ScarJo was awesome as Major btw and the perfect choice to play her. People have been doing this for years and it's not just ""whitewashing"" as some would have you believe. Fanboys complained when Samuel L. Jackson was cast as Nick Fury when he's white in the comics and they complained when Will Smith, another black man was cast as Deadshot. Both Samuel L. Jackson and Will Smith were great in the roles and I could care less about the color of their skin. Scarlett was great here too as the major but because the color of her skin wasn't quite right for fanboys they stupidly ignored it and missed out. I couldn't care less what the color of your skin is, if you're good in the role then that's all I need and Scarlett Johansson was damn good in the role. This whitewashing crap and complaining about a characters skin, including Jackson and Smith, in every movie actually contributes more to racism in this country because doing stuff like bitching about the characters skin color brings racism to the forefront again when we're trying to all be equal. People are so stupid that they don't even realize that in Ghost in the Shell it's just a body, it's just a shell, the girl, the soul is an Asian girl which the new movie explained. People need to just get over shit sometimes and just enjoy a good movie because I guarantee all of you morons who wanna ""boycott"" ghost in the shell because of ""whitewashing"" as soon as you see this movie someday whether it be on Blu Ray or just on TV someday you'll realize how ignorant you were for ignoring this movie for such a petty stupid reason.

They retained enough of the OVA to use the title but I believe they can do better and totally expect a reboot in the next few years (like they did with ""The Hulk"" vs ""The Incredible Hulk"", for example).  Some movies don't need it (like Total Recall, which was perfectly cheesy, although I'll never turn down Kate Beckinsale on any medium)  Did the producers and director think that the public wouldn't relate to this movie without some kind of love story?  Did they need to humanize the Major so much?  Subtlety is lost on this production.  They should have allowed some interpretation.  It's okay to have ""Rosebud"" elements to provoke thought in the audience.  Part of the charm of GiTS was that you wouldn't relate to it by default. Sci-Fi is meant to explore the futuristic and surreal potential of humanity.  See anything written by Asimov or Clarke.  We deserve thought provoking movies that don't try to fill in all the blanks for us.  There are no unanswered questions in this film and that is disappointing.  Actually, it would have benefited from a lower budget.",0,0,diablogate,G4VmJcZR0Yg,0.12751068376068375,2017-04-24 14:41:41,False,True

All we got from this movie was ""Memories don't define you."" Okay, cool. What happened to the, ""What is consciousness? Who are we to say a being or species is not conscious or self aware when it would be so hard for another species or being to figure out that we are. Why are we self-aware? Is there meaning to it or accidental? Is reproduction our way of immortality? But passing on our genetic pool as far as that bloodline will take us? Is a part of our consciousness put into each person we 'create'? Are we all one single consciousness that has branched out since the beginning of mankind?"" I was really hoping, with this movie reaching such a wider audience, that it would use something at least similar to the Puppet Master's speech to try and turn that little switch on in people's brains. One that makes people possibly more self aware than they want to be for that moment in time. I remember the speech so much from the original that I saw when I was 16, and it had such an impact on me. It made me take a step back at the bigger picture on a nearly daily basis. Which is honestly a bit scary but I do wish more people did it.

Was this written by the emo in the back of highschool algebra class or something?  **edit:**  Yup.  The ugly forgettable deus ex ""bwaa"" music goes on for 21 minutes . . . . oh and deleted some bullet points because they are selfish xD  --31 minutes in: "" Hack this, hack that, he's being hacked, that's being hacked, hacked hacked hacked "" Don't insult your audience by dumbing down everything into leymans-terms  xD  I will say though. I am loving the 'bro'mance between the major and batou though. lol  Guess that's one of the perks of being the director//writer. Do whatever the hell you want and it's awesome ‚ô•  It's really strange though. It's like the first 20 minutes of this movie are directed differently(probably for that ""first 5 minutes"" trailer) and it really tries to put you off from sticking around to watch the rest of it, but _its like that one asteroid movie_ where the people get better at playing their parts later in the movie. It's really fun to see how horrible the first chapter of the movie is compared to the final 30 minutes, and even the music direction is different. (p.s. sadly, nothing like this trailer music, which is absent. making the trailer theme of this upload total bullshit)  The big problem with this movie is that it tries to make everything uncanny instead of just letting go of the source material and replacing the more outlandish stuff with what will work _in real life_. The yellow-spandex effect and ""YourCostumeNeedsWork"" tropes in full effect. If you can't go for the fancy noir undertones and jazz pieces that the source materials liked using, try some other thematic setup.

They gave a reason for her being white and not asian which tbh I didn't really care about that much but just to all the people who are mad cause she isn't asian; her ghost is japanese and her shell just looks like a white chick which to be fair Scarlett fits her really well. Over all I felt this version had a more clear cut plot and executed it very well. It went very in depth on the idea of the ""ghost"" and the ""shell"" and I felt it brought much more to the table than the anime.

Scarlet Johansson is one of the finest actors of her generation & a babe to boot but when are Hollywood going to fund a movie that has foreign elements with all of the actors from those actual countries...  Its an odd one as the asian market were enraged by the choice of actor's for this movie yet Manga & Asian Art for many years has been clearly been drawn to look more western & more disturbingly i watched a documentary many years ago were a large portion of Asian Women were having drastic & invasive surgery to look more western to the extent one young lady had her face peeled straight off to the back off her head so the plastic surgeon could get full access to break & shape her facial bones to look more western...  I am usually fascinated by any medical & procedual operations but this one disturbed me greatly as it was not about changing one's shape here & there but ones origins..  All of these young asian ladies were beautiful without needing any surgical procedures & had no body flaws whatsoever that I could see but this is a major problem with the so called laws put in place with regards to surgical enhancement in that There Are None as long as you can pay the money & unfortunately women are the biggest culprits for this rise as you never see your true beauty & are always wanting to look like someone else, but to look like another race is really disturbing & instead of changing their look everyone worldwide  should be embracing their beautiful looks & heritage...  When will we see a true asian box office star that hails from America as i havent seen one since Bruce Lee & that's a ridiculously long time...  Sure they'll be type cast or playing 2nd fiddle to the main star but they wont be playing the leading role & i thought we'd turned a corner when Bruce Lee finally & literally kicked down the doors of Hollywoods racists attitudes towards who stars as the leading actor that will headline a major motion picture but as this movie proves we're still in the dark ages...",0,0,YouTube Is An Influencer,G4VmJcZR0Yg,0.11621315192743763,2017-08-04 20:01:21,False,False

I think the second half of the movie was alot better when it got into it's stride a bit more, i really liked the scenes with the major and her mother i thought they were done well, and that adds alot, as i think they did get over the major's feelings of lonilness quite well which gave these scenes more impact.

The opening wasn't supposed to be an action sequence. It sets up the basics of the world, Section 6's militant structure (or is that section 9? Damn Manga's dub is confusing), the Major's job, and the abilities of a Shell. The story seems to have been altered drastically, with the Major being the first Ghost to have a Shell, but so many other things are kept the same.

The problem is just dumb script and dialogues which over-explain every banal thing but omit all the real stuff (probably it was too deep for the scriptwriters to read sum basic post-modern philosophy so they had to fill that hole with glorifying simple idea of individuality which was safer and commercially more feasible bet to keep the casual movie-goer and his uniqueness satisfied) Too much exposition of the world, killing all the mystery and subtlety and at the same time too much uselessly floating CGI's again added but for wrong reasons, ironically just to hide the emptiness of the world. Cartoon-like evil characters with obvious names, obtusive playing on feelings like every damn 5 minutes. I would cut first 5 minutes out of the movie completely. The intro unlike originals doesn't have any impact.

( okay its an anime adaptation technically , anyway) the story is also ok. best is the world and the whole city is a  possible scenery. and the details and the possibility to modify your body if you had the money. this could be real soon and then i think a world where you can upgrade , modify or change your look money becomes more important. to be honest i would save some to get good quality body parts. for me the movie is one of the best cyberpunk or anime adapts. by the way the coulours and the look is its very stylish the lights hologramms and this part where she's diving. i look a lot of movies actually there is a lot of junk, a lot of movies how  entertaim u with actuon but  some movies are still epic and this is one of em , and since 1yaer i read more mangas and like cyberpunk so i shuld watch this earlier. anyway could identify myself with the main protagonist  great work.",0,0,lightning returns,G4VmJcZR0Yg,0.3503134920634921,2019-04-24 00:00:17,False,False
