2015-05-25T19:02:01,"I just cannot grasp how people can't enjoy a movie with subtitles, and I believe the same applies for the other side. I believe that's why the issue is so divisive, there are basically two sides that are only true from their own perspective. The truth is that you lose some on both subs and dubs here is my objective rundown of both pros and cons.  * Subs are distracting for people who are not used to it (fixed with practice/makes you a better reader/aids you when learning a foreign language). * You may lose some semantics in translation (same for dubs). * They may block in strange circumstances some aspect of a scene (very few directors chose to place extra detail in the bottom of the screen, in fact they plan against it). * Some languages require very extensive text (you can alleviate it by simply choosing your font carefully and optimizing the size) * Some languages will have words that simply lack a simple translation (same for dubs) sub companies can add a note to explain the meaning in the top part (this is not practical if you can't pause the movie/pausing is distracting) dubbing companies however, can either add the note, beating the whole purpose of not reading or leave it as it is, forcing the viewer to consult a dictionary afterwards (this is much more likely to cover details of the frame, but directors usually keep the point of interest near the center of the frame anyway). ¬† * Dubs are expensive and more time consuming to obtain. * You have to do extra sound mixing, that may not capture the details of the live performance. * Two very different languages will never have dubs that syncs with the dialog (Chinese-spanish for instance/you can edit the mouth movement to match, but this usually results in unnatural movement that only aggravates the problem). * It is very difficult to find a voice actor that fits the overall tone and style of a specific actor in a specific language, this results on more distractions when the voice does not fit the character (dubbing companies may have a prefered voice actor for a specific foreign actor, so you get used to their performance). * Hearing the same voice actor representing two different actors is distracting (dubbing companies rarely do that). * A language may have a greater or lower average word/sentence lenght and therefore voice actors will need to speed up or slow down their performance to catch up (you can alleviate the problem by doing very subtle edits on the rate of the movie, being careful not to affect the final run time/this brings the cost up). * Adding further localization (dubbing with specific language variations and accents from different regions) only doubles the workload (same for subs).  Subs are like cheap alternatives to dubs and therefore allow foreign movies to have a much greater reach, that many unpopular movies would never get. They also conserve as much as possible of the original movie, and so reduce the amount of work, time and money that you put into it, so a sub version will always be available first.  If you do it enough, before you know it you suddenly are familiar with the grammar and vocabulary of the language (getting subtle acting hints from a foreign language is always tricky), of the five problems associated with subs, one is alleviated with practice and has better consequences, two of them are also present in dubs (one of them has a better handling in subs) and yet another one is planned against.  Subs are also necessary for people who are hard of hearing or when the performance has mumbling (again, with practice you can ignore the subtitles when you know the language).  So if subs are objectively better why are there still so many dubbing companies, dedicated to even sub in language variations, who are willing to have a one to one correspondence with their voice and foreign actors, that may even edit the rate of the movie.  Dubs and subs are only effective if they are of mother tongue languages, because we have a natural bias towards them, if we add some bias towards verbal communication, we have that people find them preferable even if they don't find subs distracting.  The existence of many dubs is also a great indicator of the success of the movie, since many more cultures are willing to add extra resources to make it more enjoyable for their public.  Of the seven problems associated with dubs, one of them is also present in subs and all of them except one can be alleviated, the majority of those are dependent on the amount of resources you are willing to place.  So the overall algorithm is this: Do you want to ""enjoy"" a movie whose original language is not your mother tongue?¬†¬†¬† ¬† Yes (continue to a) No (Stop) a) Do you know the language? Yes (continue to a1)¬† No (continue to b) a1) Do you want to improve your skills on that language? ¬†Yes (Watch the movie without subs to practice recognition and imitate the actor for pronunciation) No (Enjoy the movie without subs anyway) b) Is there a dub of great quality (as stated above) avaliable? ¬†Yes (Enjoy the movie that way and continue to c if you want) No (continue to c) c) Is there a sub of great quality (as stated above) available? ¬† Yes (continue to d) No (Wait for a good sub or dub to be released or learn the language some other way) d) Do you find subs hard to read? ¬† Yes (continue to d1) No (continue to e) d1) Do you want for it to not be the case ¬†Yes (Try out subs and enjoy the benefits stated above, practices makes perfect) No (Wait for a good dub to be released or learn the language some other way) e) Are you interested on learning that language and/or reading faster? ¬† Yes (Try out subs and enjoy the benefits stated above, practice makes perfect) No (wait for a good dub to be released or learn the language some other way).  This asuumes everyone has a bias towards ""least mental effort"" but some people have a bias towards the ""purity"" of the film, for those cases you just need to replace every instance of sub with dub and viceversa.  For content creators the algorithm would be:  Do you want to expand the reach of your movie towards communities not familiar with the original language? ¬† Yes (continue to a) No (Stop) a) Are you willing to place extra effort into making a good dub that may lose detail anyway? ¬† Yes (If you are not in charge of the dubbing team, make sure to leave enough notes on the distinct voice cues of the character and possible semantic indicators, then continue to b) No (continue to b) b) Are you planning on making a sub? ¬† Yes (If you are not in charge of the subbing team, make sure you leave enough notes on your script to lose as least as possible in translation/do not place details near the bottom part of your frame, the top part is optional) No (Stop)  As you can see the only lossless option for viewers would be to dominate the language (not practical), and content creators always lose more with a dub even if they don't invest money and man-power into it, but the general consensus is that doing both is always better than doing just one or none, since then you have two happy demographics, the problem being that they keep being in conflict between each other, but that is something the director can't control.   If you have limted resources however, it is always better to only do subs, since you can basically pay for many subs for the same price of a single dub.",0,0,Eduardo [Larry] Mar√≠n Silva,U7PX3E9M-1w,0.1600791967291967,2015-05-25 19:02:01,True,True

I thought the film was very informative and truthful about what had happened to the miners and their families during this ordeal. I never thought that any part of it was lacking. It was never boring always interesting which I didn't expect, but there was a lot of things going on in those three mouths and it was amazingly captured on the camera. Antonio Banderas was better like Mario, who kept the men together as long as they could live. And even if I knew the result, the 33 makes you feel for every character that helps you to suspend yourself. Well done and heating my heart.",0,1,G Albahri,U7PX3E9M-1w,0.26553030303030306,2019-12-15 19:04:44,False,False
