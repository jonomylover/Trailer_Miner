2016-10-23T07:35:10,Hate to say it but some movies aren't meant for some people. Yeah the movie wasn't great according to plot and being cheesy at times with basic horror themes. Even though it is a spoof. But this movie was funny. You have to have a certain sense of humor and know who Mike Epps is as a comedian. He referenced his old movies and stand up often. Also having him and Micheal Blackson in a scene together is straight gold if you ever seen Next Friday you know why lmaoo. I would give it a 7/10. Probably the funniest movie I seen since Jump Street 2 came out.,20,4,killerprey777,ivqhlpUCnZY,0.01642857142857143,2016-10-23 07:35:10,False,False

This film uses white America as a backdrop for its themes on systematic racism. It shows that in America that even the black gatekeeper assumes that the black man living in Beverly Hills is a joke. He doesn’t believe a black man can be that high in power due to the racism in America. It takes these white rich political figures and turns them into a joke of what they would truly do on the purge which is. Not accept a black superior.
