Now on to Days of future past, it unfortunately looks very different from the comic book, because everything in the X-Men CU has to revolve around Jackman...oh, I mean waay too tall Wolverine, I can't hate though he has done an amazing job. Though it is supposed to be Kitty's story, and they added so many characters that were not there, and bitched out Cyclops and seemingly removed him all together WTF! But I digress, the first two trailers for DOFP looked interesting, (beside that weird editing sh*t in the 1st trailer, were it's quite then Wolverine yells and the out of place music blast on level 11 out of nowhere, yeah wow, ok breathe dude;), anyways, this 3rd and final trailer looks Freakin' DOPE!!

Now, i know that those are limbs, and since Xavier didn't lose any part of his body, so he must be a costumer and Trask made him something different, special for Xavier, like a device that took over your body from your spines and under, because you can make hundreds of sentinels but not this little device? I mean come on now. Look at how he first met Logan, and how he punched Erik and then stumbled. Maybe he's drunk or he must've slipped because of those waters, but it could be that the device kinda hard to control, you know.

Beast continues to work on his serum/suppressor from First Class, making it better but not perfect, hence why we see both forms AND why his Beast form is more ""human"" and less cat like.

For those people wondering how Charles can walk, in the comics, Charles invented a lightweight, flexible metal braces for himself to walk in a couple of hours. The power source of it is hooked onto his belt. Maybe the young Charles and young Beast are going to make this or something similar.   Since they show the mansion and Magneto is in prison and Charles on his wheelchair, I doubt this past here is before the First Class movie happened. I don't know why Hank is in his human form(XD)  IMO, that Quicksilver is so lame. I hope in the movie is different when we got to see him in full action. Are they going to make him Magneto's son?

Which would just make it sort of a paradoxical continuous time frame in which Xavier has been on that wheelchair in past movies and already knew what was going to happen in this movie because he had already experienced it and it got him paralyzed for good.

2014-04-29T21:41:26,"In my Overrall opinion on the change of kitty pryde to wolverine was completely sexist and embarrassing. Why I say embarrassing is beacsue there excuse so totally immature! Saying Oh ""Wolverine is the most beloved character"" is basically in my opinion another way of suger-coding saying that it should be a male role model with More experience. Why make a movie about the xmen original story if basically the whole entire movie is going to be changed? as a kitty pryde fan I was completely furious when I heard about this sudden change, and then it caused me to hate the wolverine character more then I had already did so. I agree with other peoples opinions saying that they over use wolverine as the main character in every movie. in My honest opinion I don't know why people like wolverine that much anyway! hes basically a male version of a badass cat. When I say they focus on him to much is like for example...- the story between phoenix ""jean grey' and scott summers was one of the most important more cared about scenario in the xmen franchise and yet there hasn't been a movie about them, instead they put out a movie such as wolverine origens which really wasn't all that important and cared for. Back on the main topic, they could've made some adjustments that could still allow ellen page or kitty pryde to still be the leading character such as drag the time line earlier or something so she could actually be alive (if they could make a drastic move like replacing her completely the they could've done something like this) but instead on actually giving her a chance in the movie they completely replaced her. And anyone saying that main characters have to be well known are lying. If you look at first class Mystique, Banshee, pixie, havoc etc. weren't really known characters but they got to play a major role in the film portrayed as main characters.

I don't know if there were contractual disputes with her, or if they felt that Jennifer Lawrence was now capable of taking on the role, but whatever the reason, it's wrong. Jennifer Lawrence is NOT Mystique. She is a better actress than Romijn - no doubt - but she cannot handle this role. She not only looks ridiculous in the make-up, but sounds ridiculous too. Mystique is a WOMAN. Not a girl. Rebecca Romijn should have been cast. Not only that, but Famke Janssen and James Marsden should have received larger roles as Jean Grey & Cyclops.  I understand they are trying to appeal to a younger demographic with these new films, but bring back the entire old cast already!

Admittedly, the comic book series itself has some timeline ""oddities"", but the movie is over-the-top. (I'm referring to the original X-Men series, not the spinoffs.) The movie itself is a great flick. Fantastic special effects, great battle scenes, and really great acting. The plot is a simple one, but pulled off beautifully. As a devoted comic book junkie, I would recommend this film to anyone. It would be interesting to hear the opinions of the film from someone who isn't especially into the comic's scene. -side note- When I went to see the film, three quarters of the people in the theater were upper middle-age like myself.

2014-06-16T20:15:51,"Right now I'm making my own ""fan fiction"" which takes place a few months before the future of Days of Future Past (although the story starts in 2013). It features my own fan-made mutant (who I based off of myself because I like it that way and it's easier for me to write that way) named ""Shapeshifter"".  Shapeshifter has the mutant power to shapeshift into 11 different fictional creatures/monsters that he drew years prior to the discovery of his powers. Each creature is extremely dangerous (as described when he first discovers his powers).  Each creature has it's own amount of energy which means that after using one creature for a long time it will become very tired and vulnerable, if the creature is wounded the injury will carry on to his human form (as long as it doesn't involve limb loss or an injury that cannot carry over). When he shifts into a creature he gains it's abilities, resistances, and weaknesses. Shifter also has a ""Rage mode"" or ""meltdown"" which causes him to have a violent and aggressive fit in which he loses control and uses his powers to severely injure if not kill any Human, Mutant, or Android around him. This happens when Shifter is extremely angry (which can happen very easily), or if he is struck by high voltage natural electricity.  If Shifter is sent into shock, knocked unconscious, paralyzed, incapacitated, or frozen he will instantly morph back into human form.  His friends consist of  ‚Ä¢ LN2 (or Liquid Nitrogen, Cryokinesis abilities that are not unlike Iceman's however he cannot create an ice skin but instead can lower room temperatures low enough to freeze everything solid) ‚Ä¢Mantle (Pyrokinesis, can also set himself on fire with blue flames and can also manipulate/create Magma) ‚Ä¢ Leadman (equivalent to Colossus but instead has Lead) ‚Ä¢ and High Winds (can manipulate weather patterns involving wind)  The only rival I've written for Shapeshifter besides the Sentinels is the daughter of Meggan, Shelby (who has the same Shapeshifting abilities but can only shapeshift into creatures of legend such as Werewolves, Dragons, Loch Ness Monster, etc.) because after reading about Meggan's powers I thought she would be the perfect rival but she was too overpowered so I made a weaker version of her.  So anyways, the story will be all about Shapeshifter's discovery of his powers, going to Xavier's school, becoming an X-Men with his friends, and fighting off the Sentinels.  :-)  All of this was inspired by the movie because THE MOVIE WAS SO F-ING AWESOME! :-)",0,0,The Western Fountain,gsjtg7m1MMM,0.07904761904761905,2014-06-16 20:15:51,False,True

The story was great because it stayed on track for me and made sense the whole time. Great dialogue, A-list performances, and as always, Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Lawrence are in it, so what's not to like?  Criticism? A little. One problem I had was the great Jennifer Lawrence was given so little to do. She was almost like a standby character the whole time, a major problem since her character kinda carries the plot and conflict.   Also, a SERIOUS lack of action. OK, I know we got Quicksilver and a floating baseball stadium dropped around the White House, but other than that it felt slow and much calmer than all the other films.   Overall, an ace movie. I agree, it is the best X-MEN movie since X2.
