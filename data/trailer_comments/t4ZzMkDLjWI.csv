[Spoiler Done]  I expected a great science fiction movie, like Star Wars or something like that, but what I ended up with was Eddie Redmayne as a quiet psychopath bent on killing his mother's reincarnation.  And Romance, there was too much romance in the film to the point where you would want to end your life after 45 minutes.  However the visuals were stunning, I must admit that.

Not all of you have to be hard core all the time! Calm down, get laid, move out of your parents basements, or whatever it is that makes you happy and run with it!! YOUR NOT REAL CRITICS SO STOP ACTING LIKE EM!!! You don't get paid to comment negative about everything btw...just incase some of you thought you did and when you check your accounts realize you don't its OK! Smile! Find a hobby! Something!! Please! GET A FUCKIN LIFE!!:) That is all!:)   Haven't watched the movie yet..I'm sure its probably decent and that's what I'll take it as. A decent movie. Definitely won't be bashing it or any movie.   Don't have nothing nice to say...KEEP YOUR FUCKIN MOUTH SHUT!!  I know I just ranted and said some not so nice things...call me a hypocrite its OK.

I disengaged right after Jupiter went to her house with her new found alien fam only to find the other villainous alien crew waiting for her arrival anyways I thought something was wrong with me for thinking it sucked cow nipples especially after reading the ample amount of positive user reviews on IMDB I'm sorry movie director,producer and actors of this film but I just couldn't hang on any further Ughh! this movie felt so forced and pretentious even if it was fantasy based which are my faves. Everything felt so rushed which left me no opportunity to relate to the characters and develop empathy for their shortcomings.
