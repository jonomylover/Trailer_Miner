2018-07-24T06:50:14,"I loved unbreakable when it first came out apart from the subplot of Mr Glass committing terrorist attacks just see if anyone happened to have super powers, I always found that ridiculous and how convenient it was that Bruce Willis' character was 'discovered' so close to home. This was the big twist at the end of the film and I hated it. Mr Glass turned out to be nothing more than a nerdy kid with brittle bones who was so angry he couldn't go outside to play that he grew up and killed hundreds of people around America and got lucky. Excuse the pun, but I always found his character weak even though brilliantly portrayed by Mr Jackson, but after seeing this new Trailer I still fail to see what substance he offers. Is he just so angry now that he wants to carry on killing people? Does he want to take over the world? Split was interesting, but it all feels like an after thought now with Unbreakable being so long ago, none of it feels intended or flows well even it was planned fifteen years ago. Really hope I'm wrong and Shymalan does something special with this movie, but I'm struggling to get excited.",4,1,mickfriday,aBL6COBGjCA,0.039073593073593066,2018-07-24 06:50:14,True,True

2018-07-25T09:41:50,"Am I the only really confused about this film? Unbreakable is a movie that doesn't need a sequel, certainly not one made today. It was released all the way back in 2000, when there were literally no good superhero films. Spiderman was two years away and X-Men wasn't to be released until 2003. Superheroes, especially movies featuring them, were a joke at the time. Hence, Shyamalan made a superhero film that tried to be the opposite of all the tropes you'd expect. It was dark, slow, ambiguous and had a (really dumb) twist. This led to it, and M Night himself, being lauded with praise; everyone loved Unbreakable. However, time has not been kind to it. Unbreakable is incredibly flawed (as you'd expect from any Shyamalan film) and it did not in anyway merit a sequel. The most interesting part of it was the family drama. Bruce Willis is a man struggling to pay the bills, with a broken marriage and a distant son. The discovery of his powers may at first seem to be a blessing, bringing him closer to his son, but ultimately, they only cause the relationship to fracture more. That's the interesting part of Unbreakable and it seems completely absent in this film. Bruce Willis' character himself is quiet, dull and generally unintelligent. He is not in any way a likable protagonist. Hell, the first thing we see him do in the movie is try to cheat on his wife. A boring good vs evil fight that this trailer presents seems, to be quite frank, dull. Also, why is Bruce Willis in a mental hospital? His powers are provable, there is no possible element of insanity to them. And 'Glass' has no actual powers either! He's just a prick! The whole thing seems just so stupid. Why isn't he still in prison? He murdered thousands of people! Intentionally!

2018-08-03T21:18:23,I did not despise Split. To me it was just another stupid Shyamalan movie. I was shocked to find out that most people actually loved it. But that comes down to taste I guess. What I find really funny though is the idea that it is considered a sequel to Unbreakable just becaue Bruce Willis showed up at the very end to shortly say something while sitting down and drinking. By this standards you know what else should be considered a sequel? Guardians of the Galaxy. As a sequel to Howard the Duck.

Glass and Beast team up and run away. Bruce Willis will face the Beast but Beast knows that his weakness is water. So he drowns him. But the Dr. saves him. Then the girl tells Bruce Willis that the Beast's weakness is saying the Kevin's name. That's how Bruce Willis will win at the end.,0,1,Hojjat,aBL6COBGjCA,0.8,2019-01-19 21:59:59,False,True
