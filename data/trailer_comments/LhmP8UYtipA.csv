I love family guy but shows don't last forever before what made it so wonderful becomes compromised in some way (aka ""Jumping the shark""), not that I'm saying I think Family Guy has gone that way.  However, I've unintentionally missed most episodes as of late, so I can't say one way or the other with any kind of authority.    But, more than all of that, IMHO MacFarlane is an amazing talent and he should be allowed to and encouraged by his fans to try new things and do what makes him happy.

I dislike SethMacfarlane but I luv his works Familyguy, AmericanDad, Ted, and this movie  Racist parts of movie... theres a shooting game and it's called ""Runaway Slaves""..... the scene when he ""talks Indian"" he's not  talking Indian if you hear closely its like he's doing Asian accents. the final scene talking with Indians he teases and mocks other cultures by saying a wise proverb once said its smart to share drugs with people in a circle (so Indians, African tribes) its the same thing like a group of friends having beers or shots....almost forgot he also says wait before you kill me im Arabic and I must do my Arabic call and then he does the instrumentals of the song TarzanBoy    part from that he nails jokes about the wild wild west era LOL",0,1,Dick Tusmall,LhmP8UYtipA,0.09620535714285713,2015-04-07 00:09:32,False,False
