Because, no matter how courageous those guys were at that particular moment in time, for me personally, that whole ""event"" is just not that dramatic enough, to make a feature-lenght movie about. Still, having said all that, I really do hope Mister Eastwood (88 next year!) will eventually prove me double wrong, and that ""THE 15:17 TO PARIS"" ultimately will be a rather amazing and unexpected  (train)ride  for the senses.
