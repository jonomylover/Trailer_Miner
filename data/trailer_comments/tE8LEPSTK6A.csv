Divergent was the only one that was actually somewhat similar to the book, but insurgent and allegiant I think will be very different. I think the director had a specific intention to keep the movie more exiting, I guess, in insurgent. By creating the message inside the box and Tris going through the ""real but not real"" stimulations to get the message, I think I gives more of an excitement than Tris being scanned in the brain and all that for Jeanine Matthews. *IN MY OPINION* I personally, think that Tris being delivered to her death in the movie is better than in the book version. But the rest in the book I like better than the movie. Allegiant I think will be perhaps somewhat similar to the difference in insurgent.
