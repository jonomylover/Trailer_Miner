Of course most people do not know what this movie is all about probably because 1, they have never seen it and 2, they don't know or haven't experienced autism or someone with autism. This movie is amazing!    It's different, clever, and unique (just like people with autism) I'm affiliated with a non profit organization called Autism Unlimited. The founder Alahna Parker (look her up on Facebook) has put together this non profit because her son has autism and didn't get diagnosed until about 5 (usually kids get diagnosed before school age) her story is absolutely amazing. I'm affiliated with the art side and an event we have in the Hampton Roads, VA area called A Night Of Artism (hashtag ANOA on social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, twitter etc) I'm a singer/lyricist and headline every other Thursday night. I have been educated and aware of the different types/levels of autism on the spectrum. Basically ANOA is an event that brings together ALL people of different races religions political views and social/financial backgrounds to an event where everyone can be free. Be themselves without judgement and last but not least, share your gifts of the arts. Whether it be through music, dance, poetry/spoken word, live bands, painting/drawing, or if your a parent of an autistic child and want to share your story. This is a positive movement and ANOA is funded by Autism Unlimited. Autism Unlimited has goals to give back to the single parents of children with autism. And to put together activities/events for families and  friends. If you are interested in becoming a guest speaker, a performer, a sponsor, a vendor or simply attending, please contact Alahna Parker : autismunlimitedllc@gmail.com alahnaparker.ap@gmail.com  p.s.

And, for the bad guy, in a possible sequel of this movie, he should, try to, kill Christian Wolff, who's the main character from the first movie, who is also, the target of the bad guy in this movie. And, I also think, the sequel, should show that, bad people with autism, can do very bad things, that are just, beyond wild and crazy, because, in a way, I can like, kind of relate to that.

(If you haven't seen the flick, you really should.) My take: the real tragedy is that Christian IS Dana's ""Wow,"" but can't recognize the clear signs of that that she's giving him, so leaves when he coulda stayed (or at least offered to take her with, which she might very well have done, since her employer was probably kaput, and even if not, who'd want to stay there after all that?). Took me two viewings before I noticed this, though, and a third to confirm it in my mind. Evidence:   SHE is the one who repeatedly approached HIM, and right from the very start.   SHE is the one who moved closer to him @ hotel, right after he'd said he wished he could connect, and was leaning in, as if going for the kiss, when he had his brainstorm about Eddie Antar & the Panama Pump.   SHE went looking for him at the end -- and that wasn't just for ""closure,"" or to say ""thanks."" She was absolutely looking to hook up. And why not?  He's gorgeous by conventional standards (look who's playing him).  He's @ least 8 figure-net-worth rich ($millions in visible cash and art, God knows how much more that she's not seeing - and she's smart enough to know that).  They have major passions and life-work in common.  Finally, he keeps her safe -- against a whole team of $%^&ing professional killers. So what if he's a bit weird around the edges -- so is she!  (Reveals as much w/ that story about the Vera Wang dress and ""wanting to fit in"" in high school.  Plus, she's clearly super-bright herself, UChicago being the Harvard of the midwest, plus she's the one who found the hidden money glitches in the company accounts.) So, questions: Is this all painfully obvious to everyone but me, and everyone's response will be, duh, fool? If so, why have I not seen it mentioned in one single review or comment in any thread? Or is this a unique take, and everyone will disagree with it? In which case, how do you explain away all that evidence I provided?
