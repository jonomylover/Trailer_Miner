But Jonah keep making us all laugh. :-) Good to see Miles doing well....after Whiplash his career went up...fantastic four was a bad move though...but that's my opinion. I know some people liked it.

I will probably watch the movie, though.Also, cinema sin, the government would never tell the two people who just completely underbid every other contractor how much they underbid, or even that they underbid, so that they can then charge more later, to close the gap. Also, if they were really doing what they were doing, wouldn't they have figured out the market beforehand to know how much other contractors are charging?

Take a lesson from every other advertising medium like television for example they don't play the same fucking makeup commercial for two-and-a-half minutes it's all different commercials and then on the next commercial break it's probably very rare that they'll even play THAT same commercial,0,0,Ellis Dee,Rwh9c_E3dJk,-0.009004329004329004,2016-08-21 19:52:01,False,True

It's like a mash up of Blow, Lord of War and Wolf of Wall Street. I think it needed a better trailer because it presents itself as a comedy or farce of the genre. This was probably made to look like a certain type of film to get a certain demographic but it's tone is more of a real film instead of some dumb comedy of the month. It's actually just as serious a film as the ones I mentioned however it does have some good humor throughout that works well with the story and of course it's not a dead pan drama because of this, it tries to be a fun film and takes itself lightly in a way that works to reflect the weird time the Bush era was in these days. If you like any of the 3 films I mentioned you'd enjoy it, it's a very cool movie.",0,0,JokerCirca66,Rwh9c_E3dJk,0.21273809523809525,2016-08-31 05:22:21,False,True

But in the movie when one of his kidnap victims escapes thinking they can outrun him. He is like superman fast, which freaks out the victims. Anyway he takes his victims to an underground chamber where he rapes but sometimes only tortures to the point of death. You see he individualizes each person and rapes, tortures and kills them all according to what he believes is their personalized death. He keeps telling them he is caring for them in a way nobody else will. Gonna be a great movie. depending......you know on this that and the other.

What worked here and what this movie relied on is main two guys who give really energetic and dashing performances, you buy that they are old buddies, their chemistry and the way they rubbed each other worked so much. Story itself was also intriguing and riveting sometimes uneven, but never to the point of losing interest or becoming tiresome or idiotic. It has its own identity in a way because it shows in highly satirical way how USA is open door for anyone to make money, no matter who or what their backgrounds are. It is capitalism at its core and it worked in this film. In the end it is not anything new, it follows that same gangsta formula playing out exactly how you think, but nevertheless it is charismatic two hour entertainment and i say go check it out.",9,0,ogorjefan,Rwh9c_E3dJk,0.18630681818181816,2016-11-20 15:27:16,False,False

2019-02-14T10:52:55,This movie was a wonderful story of fiction. It is another Hollywood propaganda film meant to brainwash the public into believing that 2 small time arms dealers could supply an entire country or TERRORIST ORGANIZATION with arms.  Why? So when the US government supplies tge wrong people with AK-47's and enough ammo to attack the  American people... They can blame whoever for the deed and the brainwashed sheep will believe it because THEY SAW IT IN A MOVIE!!  The Social Network was the same type of propaganda movie. Some loner Ivy league student created Facebook when in fact it is a NSA intelligence gathering program on the American population.  The goal is to destroy western civilization so the world elite can erect a NWO. A one world totalitarian dictatorship led by the Son of Perdition where everyone is controlled and microchipped like cattle.,1,0,Hanna Naegeli,Rwh9c_E3dJk,-0.008333333333333333,2019-02-14 10:52:55,False,False
