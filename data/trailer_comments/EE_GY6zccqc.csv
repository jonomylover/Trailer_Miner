2017-10-15T20:30:49,"So last night I was able to see an early showing of ""Only the Brave"". I was a little worried going in that it was going to change too much, alter events, etc. and not do enough to honor the men who lost their lives battling that blaze. I can now say, I was Very satisfied with the film.  The acting was good, the fire scenes not too overly exaggerated, and the whole film moved nicely, keeping people interested through the whole thing (a little over 2 hours long). I would have to say my only issues were some of the films editing, and the feeling that they could have added a little more to the last few minutes before cutting the the credits (though there was a nice tribute to the real men of the crew right before the full credits started).  Regarding the editing, there are a few cuts throughout the film that jump the story ahead very suddenly (You are watching a scene, and as it's ending, it cuts, and is now 3 months later... this happens a couple times with the next being 9 months, and the last 3 years). Its not a smooth cut either, with something like a fade out. Just a quick cut that throws you off for a second. So that could have been transitioned better.  Regarding the ending... it goes from the incident, to a scene with the families at the high school gym crying, plus a one other short scene outside the gym... to 3 years later with a two scenes depicting the crew supervisors wife, and the other, the sole surviving remember of the team with his daughter. I feel they could have at least shown the memorial service for the crew, and the outpouring for them and their families from around the country, then maybe spent a little more time showing the lives of all the families a few years later.  So those are pretty much my only two issues, the rest of the film was Very well done, and I feel did justice to the crew, and their sacrifice. I only wish they had managed to show the personal lives of more of the crew members, but I understand why they focused mostly on just a few of them.  I highly recommend everyone take the time to go see this film when it opens up next weekend (Oct. 20th). Especially anyone who has spent time on the line before.

I served on Engine 3-11 at the Texas Canyon ranger station in Saugus, California in 1979 (Nickname, ""Blind Man"", because I always wore dark sunglasses). We had one of the only 4X4 Model 60 pumpers in the Angeles National Forest, and it was always breaking down, so our crew combined with our Texas Canyon Hotshots often. Their ride was a converted green school bus with a Zuni Indian emblem on it. I have harrowing yet unforgettable memories from fires I had the privilege of fighting alongside BOTH crews! Mistakes were of course made, contributing to this particular tragedy, but valuable lessons were learned as well. Regardless, this movie ripped me up inside and still haunts me this morning. I will never forget our ""Fire Card"" trainer calling our fire tents ""Baked Potatoes"", because they were silver back then, and if the fire persisted around you, instead of moving past you, it would literally cook you inside!

One of the guys in the movie wasn‚Äôt an actor his best friend was killed so they let him play that part.
