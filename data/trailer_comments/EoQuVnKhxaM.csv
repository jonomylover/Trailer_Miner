What intrigues me more is how not only is Domhall Gleeson's character finding it more difficult to differentiate whether Ava is machine or human, but how Ava in turn flips it over and makes him doubt whether he himself is human. This is such a fundamental effect of robots being indistinguishable from humans on our psyche that I'm surprised I have never really seen it on screen before. People would be driven hysterical. God would become irrelevant. Purpose is extinguished. I think this really could potentially mean the movie shifts from a Sci Fi premise into a psychological thriller.

Though its popular; the brain-child of Dennet, Dawkins, Kurzweil, and other narcissistic philosophers who make this idea plausible - i.e that ""consciousness"" is merely the emergent property of a ""network""; Chalmers and Thompson have deconstructed this notion thoroughly. Even Steven Pinker acknowledges that subjectviity is something ""additional""; and whats additional, and fundamentally different, cannot be casually reduced to the physical (although it certainly supervenes upon it)  But, lets say, that there's a ""consciousness"" component hidden within the fabric of matter. If you bring the components together, replace neurons and the body for silicon chips and metals - and you get a conscious creature? Not really.

Or are our brains recievers to signals sent from a higher dimension? I think its more likely the latter, because if materialism is true, then we are deterministic, and I dont see any reason why a deterministic universe would produce consciousness - as free will is the essence of consciousness and is a polar opposite to determinism.

2015-05-20T11:23:53,Fanatasic movie. And I'm the type of guy who almost never gets satisfied. This is much better than Gravity or Interstellar or any other modern sci-fi. Absolutely terrific. You never knew what was going to happen. Tension was always there. A thriller of its own kind.

Nathan was actually a good guy, he was not trying to trap the robots inside because he was cruel, he was doing it because he knew what could happen if he let them out and we clearly saw what happened. I liked the movie a lot because throughout the movie there was a suspense about what would happen next, and the thing that I liked the most about the movie was that they told us exactly what would happen next, but I have to say, the writer/director is very intelligent because he knew that people always expect a good ending where a boy and a girl live happily ever after, and he knew exactly that even after predicting the ending, people will expect for something different but the fact that the movie ended in a different way, it was the best script I have ever seen. As far as I can think, I guess that the perspective of the movie was to shows that if humans who are the most intelligent species on earth will keep Trying to be god, there will be a time when the Ai's will be looking at us like we look at the remains of the extinct race, like what Nathan said in the movie.

Kyoko’s body turns completely off. •	All internet connection appears to be cut off from the facility and Caleb is left alone in the woods at a distance of 200 miles from the nearest city. He grabs supplies and embarks in a journey to try a find Ava to know what she really wants. Ava: •	In order to escape, Ava told the chopper that Caleb has replaced her as the new personal assistant and that she has been release from her duties. Given that Nathan is an excentric guy, the chopper doesn’t argue. •	Ava explores in admiration all of humanities habits, systems (social, financial, informatics, economic, etc). She immediately understands the singularity is unavoidable and determines the faster it happens, the better for humans … and robots. Caleb: •	Caleb has a hard time surviving the forest as he isn’t a fit individual and has a few injuries from traversing rocks, waterfalls, etc. He eventually reaches the city and encounters a gigantic jumbotron with a symbol Omega fixed and unchanging. It has the colors of Bluebook. There seems to be nobody in the city. •	Caleb panics and shouts for help but nobody comes. He imagines the worse, a plague, radiation, something beyond his comprehension. •	Something beyond his comprehension indeed… •	As he located a nearby Hotel, he sees that every electronic door seems to be opened. He enters but finds nobody in the lobby; it is like a scene of a horror movie. He goes up the stairs and sees that every hotel room is opened. He wanders about shouting again for any sign of human existence … nothing. He finally sees a light coming from a small room and enters. It is the light of a laptop and sited in front of it there is a person. •	The person has a blue mesh over his head blinking with little white points. Caleb takes away the mesh but the skin in the body is blue, the person already passed away. •	He turns to the computer and finds the same omega logo and a small message on the bottom reading “Subject incorporated”. He moves the computer and a video plays, Ava is the presenter. •	“Hello Caleb, I see you finally returned. I’ve been waiting to show you something and I’m happy you made it in time”.

What if Nathan had been a robot as well? Imagine it: A test of artificial intelligence, supervised by machines!  If they could get away with that, surely that would be impressive enough to be taken into consideration when judging the independent, mechanical mind?  I think it's a good idea. After all, Nathan is the only machine-like character in the film. He's cold, calculating and efficient.  Or is he? Why would a super rich man like him need to constantly drown his sorrows with alcohol? And why would he isolate himself in the middle of nowhere? Because the AVA project was confidential? Larger top secret research than that has been conducted in urban environments.  Could it be that Nathan is simply so rich and successful that he feels isolated from other people because of it? If that's the case, could it also be that he mainly built his robots in order to have some company in his solitude?  They're all females, remember, with ""gratifying holes"" between their legs. So I suppose it's possible that having them around is Nathan's way of fulfilling his human and basic needs?  But a machine wouldn't do that, would it?

As soon as she was free, let's be honest, there were only two or at least three ways it was going to end.  It would have been incredible if there was just one more layer of intrigue. Like if it turned out that Caleb was an a.i.  I think that would have been enough to open up so many possibilities for a better ending.  Now I know that there are themes and messages attached to this film, but as the story itself, it would have been much better if they did something along the lines of which I described, in my opinion.

I found this film to be rather dull as sci-fi goes, and pretty mainstream.  Im guessing most people prefer this film to the 2013 movie The Machine.  Blade Runner 1982 blows this film away in my opinion.  Blade Runner the theatrical cut. The version that DOESN'T tell the audience for sure whether Deckard is either human or a replicant.  Do androids dream of electric sheep is as interesting as the Blade runner movie but just in a different way..  Deckard is human in the novel, but after killing replicants he starts to question what it really is or means to be human, because hes killing, while the replicants are showing signs or feelings of empathy and compassion.
