2015-07-15T05:15:14,"MY REVIEW: This trailer captivates you right from the start as if a new angel to horror was coming. Not exactly, this film is entertaining and the choice of time period is very unclear do to it's high tech smart girl make-up type thing, phone, I'm not sure. I don't even know what to make of that inning-of-itself, but the movie itself ALMOST was on to something ! It was like the ring meets the grudge meets 1 missed call among many other similar concept movies. It had a small time charm to it, the ending well lets just say it left you nothing to talk about or to feel. I felt after it ended, warm inside and calm, as if I was just dreaming this crap up (NOT literately calling/saying it crap aka bad). I did enjoy the style of the film, the shots, the angels and settings designed. The only thing this has me interested in, was the origins of this demon; is there a real myth of such a thing, so far no, seems no origin exists other then creative writing. I'm not hating this movie, I didn't love it either, it was more of that old school thrill you'd get hanging out with your friends at night watching horror flix in the woodsy backyard with a projector and fire pit just for fun. I give it a 6 of 10",0,0,any4003,QX38jXwnRAM,0.08362878787878787,2015-07-15 05:15:14,False,False

There's a mixture of vintage and modern cars and the clothes and houses look old. Also [spoiler alert] she wouldn't tell her sister who she saw at the pool, because it was their dad who passed away. I know because the ghost thing looked like one of the family photographs from the house, and their mum was always day drinking in scenes, a sign of trauma.
