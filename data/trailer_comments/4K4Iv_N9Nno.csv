2015-02-13T18:50:17,"I just watched the trailer for behind the scenes of SPETRE and happened to see this and took look.  This will only have true meaning for you if you are 60 years old or older.  I remember going into a drug store that sold comics (but not always the right ones of Marvel or DC) and I saw this ""new"" comic.  The name of it was ""Dr. NO"". I still remember my reaction was that the person who I thought should have been the villain (the dude in the tuxedo) was trying to avoid the scientist looking dude who I thought was the hero (since the name of the magazine was Dr. NO after all).  When I found out it was about a spy I thought ""why would they think anyone would want to read about a spy?""  ""He doesn't even have any super powers.  Some weeks later at the paper back book rack at the old May Co. here in Cleveland I saw a book entitled ""From Russia With Love"" and it was apparently about the dude in the tuxedo in the comic book. I bought that book.  I was 14.  Then suddenly (along with Viet Nam, Civil Rights, Black Power, Hippies and Rock Music) there was James Bond, Charles Vine, Maxwell Smart, Matt Helm, (Richard Burton in, ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"") ""That Man from Istanbul"" Modesty Blaze and topping them all off and my favorite James Coburn as Derek Flint.  Shaft and Trouble Man came in the '70 and were not international.  In the midst of all this was Secret Agent Man (Starring Patrick Mcgoohan) and the ""Man From Uncle"" starring Robert Vaughn and David McCallum.  (There also was I Spy and Amos Burke -Secret Agent)  For us, for me The Man From Uncle was for American television what James Bond was to the movies.  We all know that there is this Western symbolism of the indefatigable (white-man) man who is a law onto himself.  He has a moral code which is concerned with always knowing and doing ""right"" even though the methods he employs may be completely criminal.  What I liked about tis trailer is the attempt I believe to capture the ""slick but debonair:"" aspect which Robert Vaughn did so well in the original.  Sean Connery is James Bond but Robert Vaughn is Napoleon Solo.   And what was accomplished was the establishment of an American icon especially at the time almost as big as Bond internationally and definitely as big as Bond in the United States.  These television shows and movies did what film entertainment is supposed to do ""entertain"".  The argument concerning the ""acting"" abilities or lack there of is a misplaced on since while we want someone who can actually act playing any of these parts, to imply there is no realism is ridiculous.  There cannot be any realism since this is not ""reality"" TV or film.  What is ""real"" concerning a CIA or NSA mission?  Would it be ""real"" the moment it has been ""dramatized"" for public consumption as entertainment?  Is there any ""entertainment value of serious note in say footage of war in progress anywhere?  Do we look to see if Sargent Joe Blow is really telling his Captain what for?   My favorite was James Coburn as ""Derek Flint""  Flint for me was the very epitome of what was being attempted by so many.  My regrets concerning Flint was that Saul Paul did not produce any more.  James Coburn was also the perfect actor for the role. (Just think is there anyone acting today who could step up and step in and take his place should they do a re-make or re-boot?  No not without changing his persona.  Finally, I will see this new ""Man From Uncle"" if and when they release it to see if it will ""stack-up"".  I disagree somewhat with several commenters below who don't like Hollywood doing remakes. I don't like it if all they are doing is trying to have a pay-day.  It been proven enough times that those who don't get it won't get it that if you have a good story and good direction with people who really care about their work then they will crate a work of art and everybody will get paid.",0,0,James Page,4K4Iv_N9Nno,0.09754275778865945,2015-02-13 18:50:17,True,True

2015-08-14T18:01:36,"I was kind of underwhelmed by 'The Man from UNCLE.' Although the 60s setting for a spy movie was refreshing (at least for me), the plot unraveled the expected way and the action scenes were measly. I dunno, it must have been the uber-cool trailer that didn't live up to the film, or that because I also saw the hilarity that is 'Spy' and the perfection that is 'Mission: Impossible: Rogue Nation' in the same month and I couldn't help but compare. Nevertheless, Alicia Vikander was a sight for sore eyes (as always) and the pair of Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer was a comic force to be reckoned with. 4 of 5 stars!",3,1,nivribocaj,4K4Iv_N9Nno,0.0015530303030303005,2015-08-14 18:01:36,False,True
2015-08-14T21:04:49,"SPOILERS! Just saw this movie. Like Avengers 2, if you love bad jokes and don't have a brain you'd probebly enjoy it.  This movie was PACKED with bad scenes, story, small-talk and ""hot-angles"" of hunks and a petite girl. This movie is truly for small minded people.   If there was a way to get my money back after seeing a movie I'd do that in this case. I almost left the theatre half way through (I only stayed because I payed for the junk). Even if I downloaded this movie for free on piratebay I would just stop 15 minutes into the movie and delete the file.  What happened with Guy Ritchie? I love his old movies and are a big fan of even buying them to see again, but this movie? Really? It's like Apple after the death of Steve Jobs. It's just Hollywood trying to milk a dead cow.  This movie is like a soft-porn where you have two hunks, where one of them wants to nail the petite teen (Alicia Vikander) but with clothes on. The other guy are nailing every other girl in the movie even if they're enemies and you're not even seeing the scenes. There are no real connection in the acting and are just ""hot"" people but into a movie to cash in on the publics interests of sex, without sex. It's sooooo boring. I got a bit of panic cause there are just nothing in this movie that was interesting, funny, hard-to-figure-out, or anything... It's simply 116 mins of waste of time.  I'd even watch PewDiePie before this. (and trust me I hate him as well)  I do not recommend you to watch this peace of junk. I guess I have to wait for The Hateful Eight to see a REAL Hollywood class movie again. All love to Tarantino so far since he and very few others still have a soul for movie-making and are not falling under the roof of milking the dead cow. If I have to give this movie ONE positive aspect, it's costume design.   Edit: If you read my review and don't respect me you can read other ""real"" critics writing the same stuff.
