2018-07-13T13:26:34,"This is my personal opinion. I hated this movie. I found all the main characters to be insufferable, especially Firth's character (who didn't have much or a narrative arc at all). It also seemed like Stone and Firth had no chemistry on screen together. Stone is a talented actress, but she did too good of a job pretending to be a hokey fake medium. All in all, the film felt corny and poorly thought out. I also found that the music, period music with a tinny gramophone effect, made the film less immersive than it could have been. There were many moments where something softer or more pensive would have suited the mood much better than the upbeat dance numbers.",0,0,lostinthelookingglas,KNJ_x3nQsgI,0.09999999999999999,2018-07-13 13:26:34,False,False
