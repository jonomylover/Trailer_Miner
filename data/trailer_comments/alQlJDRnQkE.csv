Also, I don't think it's gonna be very fun to watch 2 hours of 47 waiting around for the guards to leave in order to poison the target's food. So there has to be some action, but it has to be forcefully brought upon 47. In addition to that, they need to make the stealthy parts of the movie more fun by adding more movement and tension, rather than having 47 be in a closet ready to KO an unsuspecting person.  Also the action sequences could be a few in the movie which were put into the trailer in order to attract a wider audience, this is common in trailers, they misrepresent the movie.  By the way, at 1:04 it looks like he'll be using disguises, stealth and subterfuge. So indeed, I don't think this movie will have 47 enter a room and shoot his way through it.  Another problem is that part of the plot seems a bit cliche, with the whole ""One of your relatives (very often your parents) was very important somehow and now we need you because of reasons.""  So, in summary, I feel like this movie could be great, all they need to do is correctly explain and ""force"" the actions sequences (which I feel they will since it looks like they're sticking to the games), make the action sequences few. And correctly execute the plot and they're done.   P.S. I think Rupert Friend will be better than Timothy Olyphant. He looks like he'll nail the character down. And also, Rupert looks more like 47 than Olyphant. ",1,0,Arturo Peredo,alQlJDRnQkE,0.15452546296296296,2015-02-13 00:12:45,True,True

I will admit tough that the movie looks amazing, but like many people stated already, Agent 47 is all about disguise and stealth, guns blazing only if he fails to keep his masquerade up. if this movie is going to be all out shooting, then I will grand it a thumbs up for lore friendliness and good acting, but a big fat thumbs down for grasping the ""feeling"" the series has about it. the core.  Especially for the players who always go for the silent assassin award, literally killing NOBODY but the primary targets while NEVER being spotted by there enemy's. While in this movie he might as well be carrying a portable spotlight around to stand in it the entire movie as he's not trying hard to hide himself or not to shoot people who are not his targets.  Also I liked the looks of the guy from the first movie better.  And again with a stupid subplot no less, why does every movie need to pull that one? why can't the movie just follow 47 alone?

Whether he said that as a joke or not is irrelevant, the point is, is that he had no intention and no interest in doing another afterwards and for that, he is a dick.  Also I completely agree and I find it super annoying when Hollywood gets their paws into any adaption of a game or book. Thing is... action sells and dumb people (the majority of cinema goers) will be quite content with a shitty back story and a lack of cohesion. Transformers 2 onwards is a perfect example of this. With this film however, as Mickey has said, is simply far too action hero and obviously this is just for the ""oooooh"" ""aahhhh"" effect, because few people want to see a man sneaking around trying to avoid being seen. In any case, even if more people did like a better story and a closer following with his profession and tie-ins to the game, the movie studio doesn't care and will ruin every franchise it gets its hands on because they will always choose the option where the biggest money is. Imagine a movie studio who willingly dropped millions for a better story? Haha, yeah right.  This is going to be a colossal flop. No amount of special effects and super man stunts can save this film... unless of course you're an idiot and just like things that go bang, da-da-da-da-da-da-da and crack, with little reason for doing so.

In the trailer I see elements true to the series and I see a lot of pizzazz.  On the other hand, they found an actor who is both convincingly emotionally distant and intelligent.  He clearly is more naturally suited to the role than the former and has done a bit of homework with a console controller or keyboard in his hand.  Lets be real, he looks far more like the character than the porn agent from ""The Girl Next Door"", Timothy Olyphant.    I would like to see less action elements but this is a video game crowd you are catering to and not just Hitman fans, fans of...

2015-03-24T01:05:46,"So, the point of the Hitman games is to be discreet. You're thrown into the dangerous environment with, at best, a silenced pistol, and, at worst, nothing but a fibrewire to strangle people with. You have an objective, a target, and your goal is to sneak in, neutralize your target, and escape without any security or a shred of evidence left behind. That means you'll have to sneak, find alternate ways of getting inside, knock out some troublesome guards, disguise as them, bypass security measures, get rid of evidence, all of that. As such, getting a perfect score on a level means that the police will have no leads, and, for all they know, it was a freak accident that killed the victim. That is, when they're not found dead a few hours later, when the killer is long gone.  That's the ""perfect"" score in a level, because this works well with Agent 47's reputation of a walking myth, an urban legend that nobody really believes. ""The perfect assassin, cloned in some science facility"", scoffs everyone, while 47 is right beside them, well disguised and inconspicuous.  Many people, myself included, love those games because of this mechanic. The mechanic that you have to watch your surroundings, find an appropriate way to dispose of the target, and carry it out. It's a puzzle game, of sorts, with lots of action and an interesting story to boot.

Now Orlando Bloom seems to be ideal for the acting part, but all the time I look at him I'm wondering:  Why the hell didn't he build up muscles for the movie? His shoulders look so thin!  Agent 47 is a living killer machine and not some delicate bald Legolas! I think Orlando Bloom is a good choice, cause it takes the brand Hitman to a next Level. But really? Did this guy even visit the gym before making the movie?  Also, from what I see I'm missing the black humor of the game (e.g. the sushi guy elevator scene, which was glorious) as well as the ridiculous costumes. I wish Quentin Tarantino had been director for Hitman. He knows how to portrait ridiculous characters, as well as ice-cold-killers.",0,0,Gantzephon,alQlJDRnQkE,0.02362689393939393,2015-04-07 16:31:11,True,True

Then just casually walks into the tailor's with soaked clothes and no socks on, and walk out looking even better than the previous scene...

I played every hitman game and what would be the point of making a movie with total stealth and different targets for 2 whole hours. That's literally boring. And if I recall you could go in guns blazing on some missions. And dont give me thst bullshit of if you go in guns blazing you don't get the concept of the game bullshit. Case and point of changing games to movies. DOOM was a game turned into movie when they came out with DOOM 3 the game I believe back in 04. If you played DOOM it was slash up kill all demon game and trying to figure out about the company in the future UAC. When Doom 3 came out for the first time you were to save the world from hell itself. Now the movie gave a different story and said it was mutation in genes that did it. Completely changed the story from the game. Even the last Hitman movie was not like the games neither was different game movies like AC, Heavenly sword, Halo foward onto dawn. Hell Gears of War books tell a different story from the games and goes more in depth about the war itself  and  I don't see people bitching about it. Hell fast and furious went from street racing to action movie. So because it's not like the game it's going to either suck or just be a waste of time to some people.

Example from trailer: Instead of having an ENTIRE SWAT TEAM zipline towards a guy who is proven to be a trained assassin and extremely dangerous, which will obviously lead to their deaths, why not just stop his car and snipe him from a distance? The answer is pretty simple: It will actually be able to kill him, and if it doesn't and he somehow manages to escape it wont look ""badass"".  What I want to see in this movie (and in all movies in general) is LOGIC and REALISM. When the main character manages to escape a situation where there is logic and realism it makes the movie/scenario much more entertaining and fun to watch.

Here's a good scene: A movie exec sits a a desk on the phone talking about how the movie didn't have anything to do with the games but that it still made him money. Two gloved hands and a taunt thin wire emerge from a shadow behind him. He hangs up the phone and 47 begins to strangle him. As the shot zooms in on 47's face we see his eyes shadowed, an emotionless stern expression of only silent intent on his face. As the exec slowly loses conciseness he makes a final grasp at 47's shirt disheveling it slightly then his hand falls to the side of his chair. 47 removes the fiber wire from the exec's neck and lays it on the desk.

First off to @jesse jibran .. you say they should already know.. but the fact or point of the agency was to be a separate and discrete agency no others knew of. Agent 47 was literally known as a ghost to the communities and authorities. Second to others ignorant to the mythology.. they complain that 47 is supposed to be silent.. TECHNICALLY it's just that he CAN be silent and it's ONE of his skills he's known for and it's meant to be emphasized the most in Hitman: Silent Assassin.. although even in that game it's still an optional method as always. It all use to depend on the mission 47 was in that he would make a choice of which method he needed or preferred.You fans really need to start paying closer attention to the story details. Now if you WANT a more silent plot, that's a different story, but it seems they probably didn't go as much in that direction this time. @ROHAN ROY CHOWDHURY The first movie was not terrible as it actually stuck closer to game details, but I am glad to see another potential try at it. @Zachkills4  I do think it's interesting this movie more explains his abilities and origins unlike the first, and even goes in an enhanced scene display of those abilities, .. unrealistic, yes.. but to be fair he is enhanced .. which equals unrealistic.  Third to @SERPENTONORTHAM1992   about the whole neo comment. In the latest game.. they did start to show such related effects of him being able to do focus based skills. You could dramatically slow time as you focus on all the enemies you wanted to hit and how. You first do this near the end of the first mission after you kill Diana. He was (never meant to be neo) is debatable depending on how you see it. That is all.",0,3,ladderlight,alQlJDRnQkE,0.09102564102564104,2015-06-17 19:36:51,True,True

From the different comments, I would gather that they messed up that part pretty hard if their goal was to follow and illustrate the franchise. I will certainly agree as well with the fact there are loaaaaaads of impossibilities in there. But again : fit/unfit depends on your expectations of the movie.

Edit: In the Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, from the beginning he is a good guy but when Father Vittorio is kidnapped by the Russian Mafia he finds vengeance. But in this movie....... what is he fighting for? Agent 47 retired for good reasons and in this movie he suddenly got again in his job? I don't really understand what is really happening in the movie because all I see in the trailer is killing, assasinating, and terrorizing. You should add a methodic way of assassinating/killing a target to make the movie more exciting such as the disguise thingy, the secret passages and make some fiberwire assassination scenes sometime it would help to make the movie MOOOOOOORE thrilling and not boring to watch.",0,0,ZeroVizibility,alQlJDRnQkE,0.15416666666666665,2018-06-08 17:34:19,False,False

Guns blazing, explosions, constant action and shooting everywhere are fun, but are so constant that you know how each action scene is going to play out. 47 never misses a hit, while everyone else misses him completely.  Fun movie, but did not capture the classic Hitman feel the game has. 47 is a Silent Assassin, not someone who likes to get caught on purpose.

I know everyone has notice that kicking a table would never fire off a sniper rife, but there so much more wrongness with this. So first let' start of with the bang of the gun, we hear that but somehow agent 47 is able to lift up his hand from the start of the bang to the bullet hitting his handcuffs from point blank. That means agent 47 is faster than a bullet. Next up starting at 0:57 we can see the front barrel of the gun in the corner of the screen but no bullet. Before that when the bang had went off the bullet was already leaving the gun so the bullet should already be partly out at 0:57 and as soon as the barrel leaves the screen the bullent magically shows up.
