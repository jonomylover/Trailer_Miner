2014-02-20T16:31:22,"When someone in these kind of movies proclaims ""Avenge him!"" I would just once love to hear:  ""I do not think that is wise. We must first consider the consequences and not make any hasty decisions under stress and grief. What is there to gain in a war? Honour? Only those with weak self-esteem might seek honour. Only those who constantly compare themselves to other people, who are afraid that their fragile ego might get hurt and who see themselves unworthy unless they are best at everything might consider honour as a thing to reach for. We are wiser than that, we know our limits, and we must grow beyond the need for such destructive satisfactions as honour.  No, absolutely no war. We would just lose all our men, most likely even our lands. Honour does not feed the hungry or clothe the poor. Honour does not bring peace and prosperity. All it creates is envy of others, illusions of power and a rotting hunger for more, always more. But more of what? More illusions, more lies, more self-grandizement and ever more senseless pursuit of honour.   We must accept our situation as it is and not cultivate any seeds of further destruction. If we want more than what we have, we will work for it. We must trade goods, not sword-swings. We will accept that they won the last war, we will bury our dead, and we will move on. We will forgive them and try to understand them, and in time our people may grow closer to each other in peace. We are wise, we know how to forgive, and we know it is the only path to true prosperity.   The first thing we must do is to send a trade emissary with a proper tribute to the enemy, to notice them that they have actually now gained all the honour and our people would like to start trading again. Hopefully they will agree to open trade, since there is nothing left to gain from war for either side. They have had their last laugh, they have won and they are now satisfied. It would make no sense to have another war unless we started it in vengeance. So, general, go and prepare your troops for peace, for we are going to have a whole lot of it.""   Yeah, that is what she should have said in response. But she did no such thing. Instead, we will become the barbarous wolves we are and with a furious yell we proclaim our rage: ""Kill them all! Burn their lands! Fight to the last man!

The only free countries are the ones located in North & south America and CHINESE EMPIRE is about to strike them hard. The only relative obstacle is the US and its states.  The US states are more independent and sometimes are in direct fight against its other, because they have different political & social ethics. 2 states are the dominant ones: NY in the East (ATHENS) & LA in the West (SPARTA). NY is more liberal, democratic & artistic society and LA is more conservative & militarized. NY has the best navy forces & LA has the best army.  The Chinese Empire invades, everyone is afraid and about to give up and then LA (SPARTA) sends few men for a last stand, to awaken the rest of the states with their sacrifice. If they don’t resist, every country in North & South America will collapse and surrender in just a few weeks. The last stand take place in Florida (Thermopylae) and then the Chinese forces march to conquer NY. A united force of NY (Athenians) and LA (Spartans) {NY leads the force} decide to face them in a sea battle. They win but the main Chinese force is still intact and camped somewhere in Mississippi.  The next months, united armies under LA (SPARTA) leadership face them in a battle (Plataea) and although outnumbered 12:1 they defeat them and throw them out of US, destroying practically their dreams for WORLD DOMINATION.  The next 50 years there is a constant war between NY & LA for territorial purposes ( NY has more blame for this war) and finally LA wins. But in fact there is no winner and the Chinese Empire is happy to see both states suffer, thinking that will have a better chance to invade in the future. But from this war, another dominant state is emerging that rules for the next 20 years and this is CHICAGO (THEVA).  CHINESE EMPIRE interferes constantly with US and trying to harm them, but then the dominant state of US becomes for the first time KENTACKY (MACEDONIA), which is consider from the other states , the redneck state and for the last 400 years hasn’t got any great achievements to show.  But KENTACKY (MACEDONIA) succeeds ( FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY OF US) to unite all of the states and they strike Chinese Empire in order to free the rest of the world. They succeeded….  ",0,0,medvet,G3Rzy7YqUVU,0.15354938271604937,2014-02-23 12:22:03,True,True

2014-03-11T23:22:00,"Stop this crazy Hollywood led Iran phobia:  300- the cartoonish film retelling of the Spartans' defence of Thermopylae against a Persian horde - now has a sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire. How much of it plays fast and loose with the history, asks Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek culture at Cambridge University.      1. The first problem is the title. Which ""Empire"" is supposed to be on the rise here? The ""Athenian Empire""? That didn't even begin to rise until at least two years after the events that the movie focuses on - the sea-battles of Artemisium and Salamis, both fought in 480 BC.     2. The movie gets under way with a wondrously unhistorical arrow. It is fired by Athenian hero Themistocles on the battlefield of Marathon near Athens in 490 BC, and it kills none other than Persian Great King Darius I, next to whom is standing son and successor Xerxes. Although Darius had launched the Persian expedition that came to grief at Marathon, he was not present there, nor was Xerxes.     3. From the Persians' Marathon defeat, which - historically - accounts for their revenge expedition under Xerxes, the scene shifts to the Persians' fleet a whole decade later. The fleet is under the command of a Greek woman - Queen Artemisia of Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum), played by Eva Green. Artemisia was real enough, we learn from Herodotus, her contemporary and historian of the Greco-Persian Wars. She was indeed a Greek queen, who did fight for the Persians at Salamis. But far from being admiral-in-chief of the Persian navy, she contributed a mere handful of warships out of the total of 600 or so.     4. The film-makers included one rather prolonged, explicit heterosexual sex scene. Utterly and completely fantastically it is between enemies Themistocles and Artemisia in the interim between the battles of Artemisium (presented as a Greek defeat - actually it was a draw) and Salamis. All in the name of diplomacy, naturally.     5. The crowning, climactic historical absurdity is the notion that in order for Themistocles and his Athenians to win at Salamis they needed the help of the massive Spartan navy which turns up just in the nick of time, commanded by another Greek queen, Gorgo (widow of Leonidas, the hero of 300), played by Lena Headey. Actually, Sparta contributed a mere 16 warships to the Greek fleet of some 400 ships at Salamis, and like Artemisia's they made absolutely no difference to the outcome, which was resoundingly and incontestably an Athenian victory.",0,0,mech som,G3Rzy7YqUVU,0.00038798920377867827,2014-03-11 23:22:00,False,True

It portrays us like demons. In the previous movie, in the scene that one of Persian immortals' mask was removed, he looked like an Orc form The Lord of the Rings. Persians had the most advance empire at that time. They were not savage. Many minorities had religious freedom under their rule.   I'm not trying to justify the attack on Greece but they had burnt Sardis in minor Asia (which was in the Persian empire territory). That's why Xerxes ordered his soldiers to burn down Athens. (again I don't think that was such a brilliant idea neither).  No offence to colour people but Xerxes wasn't a black man. He had full beard and didn't have his nipples ringed.   The Persian army didn't posses around 1-2 million men.Roughly 200,000. Historians have always questioned it. How can this be logistically possible? (Considering the amount of supplies they needed). My whole point is, it would have been nice to have a neutral point of view in the movie. If Iran currently has political issues with West, it doesn't mean that its rich history and culture must be sacrificed. ",0,0,Xerxes,G3Rzy7YqUVU,0.16868055555555556,2014-03-12 07:48:01,False,True

The story was way more in depth then the second one explain a lot more instead of just war like in 300 and leaving the homeland Sparta. The ending was amazing just like the 300 ending. But the second one blew the first ending out real badly. The orchestra in the movie is wayy better then the orchestra in the first movie. Overall it was a way better movie. People just wanted to see Sparta to fight is all which they actually did. I think why people dislike because they action take place in the sea instead of on the land.

Persian  Achemenian empire followed by India's Magadh empire and later European  Roman empire were all continuity of same legacy .This war was not at all between Asia and Europe but between the motive of building large empire vs seeking independence from getting circumvent with it !! The courts of Achemenian kings was full with philosophers , educationist, intellectuals , scholars around the world Mesopotamian , Indians , Greeks , Chinese used to share ideas among each other.Sadly we try to look those times as according to the visions of handful of people who left the written account at that time which is half true but half BIZARRE!!",0,0,Dhananjay Srivastava,G3Rzy7YqUVU,0.1220956486042693,2014-04-02 01:37:27,False,True

I mean when the Athenians are fighting they always 100% win against immortals, if no one knew, Athenians weren't warriors they were small time people, farmers and stuff, yet in this movie they fight like Spartans from the first 300.  the immortals just stand around and get their arms chopped off it's like watching a crash test dumbies commercial. Then when Eva Green is fighting, all of a sudden the immortals become super powered and own Athenians like they were dumbies.

This is an example of a film that should never make it past the drawing board. (another pretty close feeling to what I had watching it). Ugh! Down right awful! (short but to the point). If they changed eva green's character to a male character and tweaked the story i mean a lot it would have a shot. (this is closest though to how I really felt).  In what world are people stupid enough to watch these chicks lead armies fighting with the men.  At on point the queen raises a sword, and all it's missing is her screaming VAGINA POWER!! with like a rainbow or something, that's the only way I could have thought to make this movie any worse and honestly it may have made me laugh so that could have even been an improvement.   The only thing I'll take away from this movie other then my head hung low, will be to know that if I ever lead a country that's a huge world power with 10's of thousands of ships maybe I shouldn't let an 80 pound slave ship slut have complete control of them.   It a strange situation to be at the end of a movie hoping that the guy beats the girls azz in moral combat.  I'd say more but I feel I've put a lot more effort into this comment then the movie was worth.",1,0,mystik whitewolf,G3Rzy7YqUVU,0.0020502645502645613,2014-09-22 09:18:55,False,False

In den letzten 1/3 des Filmes geht dann die eigentliche Fortsetzung der Filmreihe richtig los. Ohne zu viel zu verraten, so kann man den Film relativ kurz beschreiben: Ein vorchristliches Seeschlacht-Spektakel mit atemberaubenden Kampf- / Abschlachtungsszenen in Verbindung mit einer musikalischen Untermalung, die einen das Blut in den Adern gefrieren lässt!
