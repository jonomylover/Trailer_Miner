SPOILER ALERT:           Ok so first major one is when the girl and the guy escape from the basement and they HANDCUFF the blind dude with STEEL wire to a pole, he somehow gets out. That wouldn't be as big of a deal if he didn't have the magnum. The magnum was left in the room with all the tools in it, and once they handcuff the blind man they also lock the door with the dog in there. The blind guy couldn't have gotten the gun from the room without letting the dog out, or without us seeing him, or the characters hearing him.  Also how didn't the blind man get knocked out by that gas in the beginning?  How, when they were in the basement and got the girl to escape, did the man get outside (unlock 4 locks) when the keys were downstairs?  Overall, this movie shouldn't be a ""horror"" film, the few jump scares (which were not even scary) were all shown off in the trailer, so you knew when they were coming. Honestly the only time I was scared in the whole movie was when the dog jumped up on the car at the beginning of the movie. The ending was just so long, the girl almost escapes, she gets caught, she escapes again,  caught, she escapes again and then she ""kills"" the man, which she defiantly would have, I mean she knocked the dude of the head 4 or 5 times with a metal crowbar, then he fell a good story onto his back and hit his head. He is still alive, but I hope they don't make a sequel. The dog was not necessary and would have made the movie scarier without it.

Yes this gimmick of old blind war weteran defending his home sounds interesting on the paper, but in reality and the way they translated it to the big screen comes of as corny, laughable,, contrived and incredibly moronic. Little of it makes sense and the film just slowly drowns in its demise. Huge issue unfortunately is the script. It is poorly written movie counting on schock value rather than being smart and different. I am going to name some of its problems.  1.How dumb is the plan where these teens rob the place and then break the glass door to lead authorities in wrong direction? Would not the response time of the cops be quicker than the time someone spends taking particular items? 2. Dude is urinating all over the house leaving his DNA and somehow everyone overlooks that. WHAT? 3.Why is Alex helping them out? You come from decent family and you don't need to rob people? And if he does that for girls affection then why doesn't he make a duplicate key for her so she can robb and return it or destroy it after? 4. How does this girl think she can just spend stolen million dollars? Ever heard of source income? Guess not. 5. Why do they assume that blind guy keeps all that money in his house? And  why does he even live in this shitty house alone and blind when he has that much money? Wouldn't he buy or rent something better? 6.Why isn't he gassed out? 7.Why don't they knock him out when they have chance to do so? 8.How does this blind guy appear almost everywhere instantly? I replayed the basement part of the film and while they are trying to leave with his victim he goes from basement to the outside basement exit in 80 seconds? No, just no. 9.How did he abduct rich girl? 10.Why isn't he the prime suspect when the girl is missing? Yes he is blind but still i would search his house because he has a motive. 11.How does he plan to deliver baby or take care of nine months pregnancy? 12.How does he get up so quickly after taking a hard hammer shot to the skull and bleeding like a pig? 13. How is he still alive in the end after crowbar shots to the head, gun wound and high drop? 14.What is with the bullshit news story in the end? Didn't cops search the house? What about the dead girl, all the bullet holes, basement with the strap ons? There are probably more but my god what a mess this is. I just don't understand the appeal.",0,0,ogorjefan,76yBTNDB6vU,-0.0055358294188081365,2016-12-05 15:04:14,False,False

2016-12-22T11:55:10,Not being a massive fan of horror films I'm quite selective in which ones I watch . The reviews for this were pretty good so I gave it a go and I have to say I really enjoyed it. It's the story of three friends who decide to rob the home of a blind war veteran but things go terribly wrong when they find out that there is more to this man than they first thought. What I like about this is that it doesn't have any supernatural aspect to the story so it feels more real than most horrors. There are some quite disturbing scenes so it's not for the faint hearted . One especially involving a turkey baster but you will have to see the film to find out what that's all about !

2016-12-26T05:24:07,"Spoilers? Sure! Read on!! Don't click read more if you don't wanna see spoilers though!~      Three robbers are planning to move to California because their current living space sucks, and because the blonde chick (one of the three robbers) wants a better home for her sister, because her parents are just alcoholics and stoners, and don't give 25 shits about the little girl or the blonde chick. They find a goldmine of money in an abandoned neighborhood where an old veteran lives with a guard dog. The three robbers go out to find the home where the elder lives to plan out their heist, and when they see him down the street that day they see that he's blind. At 2 in the morning they set off to rob the home. They put the guard dog to sleep by throwing a biscuit that has a sleeping effect on it and it makes the dog go to sleep and make no noise. The girl climbs in the only way they CAN get in and tries to find the emergency trigger alarm and she sets it off in 30 seconds. They all go in by the girl finding the door and opening it for the other two guys. They all seek out for the money, and this one douche bag robber out of the three others triggers a laugh gas in the old guys room where he's sleeping. They all continue trying to find the money and then apparently the laugh gas didn't hit him. He figures out there is an ""intruder"" in the house, he doesn't see him but he can feel him. The douche robber pulls a gun at him and then the blind man takes it away with his veteran skills, and then shoots him with his own gun. The blonde chic hides in the closet where all the money is, and when the old guy leaves to find a bag to hide the douche robber's body, he opens the money case inside the closet, revealing the code to the girl, but he didn't know she was there. So he's usin' his tools and then the gentleman robber and blonde chick robber find a basement below and that's their only way of exit (The blonde chic has the key for the exit) and then when their going through, they find a captivated girl with tape over her mouth and chains to prevent her from leaving the spot. When she moved it triggered a bell and then the old man scurried down to go kill the two other robbers. The blonde chick unties the captive woman and on their way out the old man accidentally shoots the captivated woman, and he's sad and angry with grief. Then the two robbers get separated because when they got out after the old man shut off the basement lights to prevent them from leaving, the blonde chick went into the vents to escape and the other gentleman robber stuck fighting with the old guy, the old veteran got lawn choppers and when he thought he stabbed the gentleman robber, he actually stabbed the dead douche robber's corpse. So he didn't know gentleman robber was still alive. Guard doggo is awake and starts chasing blonde chick. Blonde chick escaped from doggo and then got captured by the man in the vents. He straps her to the captive place the captive woman was once strapped in and he explained that since he killed the captive women, the mother of his child he raped, he was going to set her free, but now that she got killed and the baby inside also got killed along with the woman, he wanted to forcefully shove semen into her and impregnant the blonde chick. Gentleman robber grabbed a hammer in time and banged it against the old guy, then he fell, and then when making their escape, the old guy shot gentle man robber and killed him. Blonde chick escaped in time and she was chased by the dog all the way to her car, she left the bag of money she needed and as she got out to escape from the dog inside the car and grab the money she got grabbed by the old guy and led back into his home. She fought the old guy and pushed him into some sharp objects and old guy got into some serious injuries, she escaped successfully with the money and when she got home, she left with the little girl to the airport. When they were in the airport dining place to finally take off to California, she saw the tv in the dining center news talking about the old guy and ""two thieves"" who broke into their home but he used self defense. The blonde chick is in shock because that wasn't the true story, then the little girl and the blonde chick left for take off to California, and then we all in shock in the credits wonder if there is going to be a sequel.",1,4,Sin Shine,76yBTNDB6vU,0.01930772569444445,2016-12-26 05:24:07,False,False

If any of them wanted a ""new life"", they could work for it like the rest of us normal, law-abiding, ethical people of civilized society. It's disgusting to victimize people in order to obtain one's selfish ambitions. The three losers targeted the old veteran simply *because he was vulnerable* ...there was absolutely no regard for his life - or what he had suffered because of the war or his daughter's death - as stealing his money would've likely destroyed the man or any ""new life"" he was trying to build since his loss of sight, probable PTSD, the unjust death of his daughter, and the likely disintegration of his marriage afterward. They had no way of knowing that he was also mentally ill and holding someone captive, so *it doesn't make their crime any less disgusting* than what it was: a greedy grab for someone else's property, damned be the consequences of the victimization they would inflict...on a disabled ""working class"" man that had already lost so much, while suffering pain like they have never known. Yet they had ZERO compassion. And like most criminals, they were only ""sorry"" when they were caught/discovered and at personal risk. Screw 'em though. In most US states, when someone breaks into your home, you have the legal right to shoot them. The three burglars had absolutely no right to even be in the veteran's house, whether or not he was now insane or guilty of a crime himself. However, it was anti-climatic that such a materialistic sociopath got away with the cold-hearted crime...and all the money. :(  She's profoundly more disgusting than the sadly deranged veteran and his turkey baster of dreams.",11,2,Leanne Mo,76yBTNDB6vU,-0.126018426018426,2017-07-15 11:29:37,False,False
