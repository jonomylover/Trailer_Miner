The trailer gives it away, Die Hard in the future with Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling and a truck load of sci-fi and action film cliche's from the last decade. What was great about Bladerunner was that it broke a lot of conventions and went a new route. This film just rehashes the same, tired old sequences from other films like the new Star Wars and will be instantly forgettable. I would like to be wrong. However, Denis Villeneuve is an okay director, okay. Arrival is okay, not great. Sicario is okay, it could have been great, but is okay. The original Blade Runner did not need explosions, it was a film noire, an existential sci-fi. This one looks anything but. Cliche's? More CGI than you can shake a GPU at. Denis Villeneuve admitted on the Arrival blueray commentary that Sci-Fi is tough and he struggles, so I respect him for that. This is not his film.

The atmosphere and the music only elevated what was going on onscreen. Perhaps the most memorable scenes for me were the parts where it was just two characters talking to one another. This looks like an action movie masquerading as a Blade Runner sequel. Plus it's weird seeing a bright sky and the holograms that look more like 'Ghost in the Shell' and less Blade Runner. You don't need amazing special effects to make a good Blade Runner film, what you need is a good script and I never ever bought that Deckard is a replicant crap.

2017-07-17T22:56:02,"It's scary to think about the continuation of this movie. Much of the fascination of the original film came from Philip K. Dick's scorn for scientific rigor. He was only interested in discussing the human soul.  The original story, both in the book and in the movie, bragged about discussing what ""human being"" is. We left the cinema thinking about what defines a human being. The film sent and recovered the old Aristotelian metaphysics in which one tries to find the essence of things. Blade Runner made me wonder when I was 18.  The atmosphere that was built by Scott was as absurd as the creation of artificial humans that Dick invented. These two things, lulled by the electronic music of Vangelis interspersed with romantic melodies lost in the midst of the urban chaos, which was only surpassed by aerial views of the city, caused a strangeness in the spectator.  Blade Runner may even work, but I believe it will be necessary to switch philosophy for action and more action (action only). The pieces of music that appear in the trailler are a bit disappointing. At least until now, no memorable melody is perceived and the percussion is exaggerated, giving the impression that it will be just another action movie.

2017-07-17T23:22:10,"Refuse to watch this - It looks like heretical junk in every respect.  Maybe I'm just nostalgic or old-school, but I'm not interested in trendy actors and over-baked plots. Just look at it - It's got all the hallmarks of cheap imitation, meant as a commercial cash grab. Full of fake CGI and shallow characters. Too fast, too overwhelming, too forced, not enough love or personality to it.  Blade Runner was an Original that cannot be replicated (intended) - A saudade meditation and study in cyberpunk atmosphere lovingly crafted through deliberate slow pacing, careful visual design (Syd Mead), pain-staking perspective shots, old-school special effects (Douglas Trumbull), and analog synth-wave meant to mimic orchestral movements, done by a master (Vangelis). It created a sense of beautiful loneliness, isolation, and melancholy, of a living breathing futuristic city, a Neo-Tokyo. You could smell the rain and neon in every scene. It created an emotional depth greater than the sum of its production parts.  Moreover, the actors were participants who spoke little, and their dialogue left space to breathe in between sentences, allowing the viewer to soak up each scene. The underlying theme was that they were dealing with an existential crisis bigger than themselves - what it means to be human, a sentient being with limited lifespan, and the right to live. There was no-one to blame, no real enemy - almost a tragedy of sorts. And yet they could have been anyone on the street - you or me.   I'll leave you with this - to ""get"" what Blade Runner is all about, what I'm talking about here - One only needs listen to Vangelis' Blade Runner Blues, while keeping the spectacular visuals in mind. It is truly one of a kind Sci-Fi Noir movie that was inspired by the culture and technology of decade it lived in (1980s), and its vision of the future still echoes with us today. I highly doubt this sequel can live up to it, and nor should it - You don't mess with a classic.",0,0,Curcumin,dZOaI_Fn5o4,0.11517066267066269,2017-07-17 23:22:10,True,True

This one just looks like your standard big budgeted Sci-Fi action film with a heavy emphasis on CG. I feel like this is relying more on the technology to ""improve"" the visuals and look instead of letting the actors, scenery, and the story itself tell it. To me, it's like what happened when the remake of 'Little House On The Prairie' came out some years ago (I know this is a sequel but bare with me) as while it was a good remake and a entertaining watch, it lost what made the original series great, which was, again, the dirty look and how it actually felt like a real location while the remake felt too clean with it's visuals and I fear this is what's going on with this movie.

2017-07-18T05:34:13,"Everybody throughout history ate bread; Stone Age man ate bread, the Greeks ate bread, the Romans ate bread, even the Vikings ate bread. But they all had different ways of making it and used different ingredients.  Stone Age Man was probably the first to make bread about 7,000 years ago, but not the kind we eat today. the theory is that whilst out hunting for meat they may have collected wild grains, crushing them between big stones and added water to make a thick gruel. Next, at some point, they started to heat this gruel on hot stones into thick flat cakes, the first bread was baked!. 'Now that's a good idea', they thought, ""if we collect all the wild grain we can and store it we can make these thick flat cakes whenever we want, even in the winter!' Soon they had another great idea. They realised that If they collected the wild grain seed and planted it near their cave they wouldn't have to wander around looking for it. Plus they soon discovered that once planted it kept coming back every year- even better! This changed the way Stone Age Man lived his live. No longer did they live as Nomadic tribes (wandering tribes looking for meat) they settled down, formed settlements or villages and became farmers. You could say that Bread helped invent civilisation, how cool is that!  Until Egyptian times bread was 'unleavened'. This means that it was flat bread like the naan or pitta bread we eat today. It was 4,000 years ago that the Egyptians discovered a kind of yeast to add to the dough called 'Barn', to make bread 'leavened' or risen. We can see loafs of bread from this time in the British Museum that look similar to the ones we eat today, but I wouldn't like to make a piece toast out of one! The Egyptians invented a process to grind the grains into a course flour, but it was the Romans who developed the idea of grinding or milling the grain and then sieving it to make fine flour. Their milling process used two large flat stones, the bottom stone stayed in one position and the top stone rotated - this is still the basis of the technique we use today! The Romans brought this system of bread making to all the lands they conquered. Thanks, Maximus Buttius!  The Romans and Greeks loved bread. They liked to make lots of different breads, experimenting with the shapes and adding fruits, spices & honey. They had bakeries in those times too. One kind was for poor people who would bring the bread dough they had prepared at home and have the baker bake it into a finished loaf. Bakers were very important in Roman times, they were the only craftsmen to have freedom of the city and not be considered slaves. They even had their own Bakers Guild called Collegium Pistorium. But such privileges did have their drawbacks, Bakers and their children could never be anything but bakers and they weren't allowed to go to the amphitheatre to see the Gladiators. We have a Guild of Bakers in England today called The Worshipful Company of Bakers, but I'm sure they'd be allowed to go to the theatre if they wanted too!  Vikings and Normans also ate a lot of bread, usually made from rye and qat grains instead of wheat. The Normans sometimes made a large flat loaf which they used as a plate for their dinner, these were called Trenchers. Does that mean if they were very hungry they would eat their plates too?

2017-07-20T22:18:49,"Why did they have to put Michael Bay-esque explosions in this? Blade Runner was never an action movie, it was a neo-noir thriller-mystery set in a sci fi universe. I hate to come off as some movie elitist but I pray the large scale action scenes are kept to the bare minimum. It really doesn't suit the tone or style of the original at all.  Not to mention the continuity issues by¬†having Deckard in this new Blade Runner in the first place. The entire ambiguity of whether Deckard was a replicant himself, something Ridley Scott has¬†continually alluded to, is almost certainly ruined¬†now. The whole point of the original was the themes of existentialism and¬†the¬†meaning of being human, and whether you know you're human or not. It made you ask these types of questions, and¬†it looks as though the new movie will almost nullify some of what¬†made the original such a great piece of cinema. ¬†¬†  The positives I'm finding are the cinematography, which looks very good. The world looks dense and well crafted. Also, Ryan Gosling tends not to sign up for movies with bad scripts and is probably the only actor around at the moment¬†that could pull a main role off in a Blade Runner movie.

Hollywood is full of crap.  This movie is not even similar to the Original Cyberpunk Classic that started the Cyberpunk genre.  This is the same old Hollywood agenda with some cheap nostalgia thrown in.  Since Rachel won't even be in this film cause Sean Young lost her mind, there isn't even a reason to make this thing.

What is completly different with this to the orginal: it is the absence of Syd Mead and his desings, it is the seemingly vast, open and unlimited space - the original was always shot in close quarters in this overcrowded environment which made you feel very tense just by virtue of being claustrophobic.  Syd's designs made the movie look futuristic, comic like, but yet real at the same time, because it oozed authenticity and functionality. The props were very carefully chosen as well. Everything in the scene had purpose and it worked.  Then comes the filming crew. The lighting and shadowing. My my...this 2049, by the looks of it has nothing on the original. Not close at all. Whoever did the cinematography on the original, please come from the other world back, these guys can't do it with all the advances of the technology.  Also, Vangelis. Vangelis and his piercing score. And Sean Young of course. And Rutger Hauer. Also Joanna Cassidy and of course Daryl Hannah. I guess, I just wanted the original look and feel ( with all the grit and grunge ) cast and filmed in 80s to be shown. Not this. We lost the way to reproduce things from the past.  Overall, it is sad that we can not have the sort of movie the first one was.

Finding Rachel's corpse and examining her DNA will allow him to proliferate the Replicant population and build his empire on their backs.  The ""Wall"" between between Replicants and humans to which Robin Wright's character refers is thereby broken by Ryan Gosling, as he is both human and Replicant.

The elites control the production and process side of things.  But robots will let the working class keep societies' cogs turning without yielding the 'field manager' requirement for personal supervision.

2017-10-18T12:47:39,"When Deckard said Rachael was special, he wasn't kidding. Director Denis Villeneuve does a commendable attempt to pay tribute to the first movie, but that's like trying to make Citizen Kane II. Like the original, it's a visually intense movie, but each scene is not a work of art per the original.  The sound track is heavy and disjointed in spots, and spot on in others. Acting across the board is excellent, even if Gosling still not my first choice, he's solid. If this movie falls short anywhere compared to the original, it's in the dialogue. The original had dialogue I still repeat in my head once in a while, whereas this movie, I can't think of a single scene that will stick in my head. The evil genius in this movie is more a side character, unlike Tyrell, who was one of the most compelling characters in the original.   The movie both pays pays homage to the original, with some characters and scenes being very reminiscent to the first, and many original to this film. By this review one might think I didn't enjoy 2049, but that's not the case at all. This is a must see movie for fans of the original if for no other reason you get to immerse yourself in all things Blade Runner for almost three hours. I don't think it really added anything to the story per se, but it's one of the better movies I have seen in some time, and any time a thinking person's sci-fi movie is made, must be applauded.

2018-04-22T17:06:43,"Top ten actors of all time 1. Gary Oldman- the most versatile actor in film history from Leon the professional to the Dark knight Oldman is unrecognizable 2. Robert De Niro- the only actor to play in pretty much every movie that built modern Hollywood. The Godfather part 2, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and Raging Bull. And if course ""your talking to me?"" 3. Philip Seymour Hoffman- never a celebrity that he deserved to be, Hoffman who ODed on heroin a few years ago was one of the most powerful actors ever. He could play the biggest ""klutz"" in Maganolia and a charismatic cult leader in The Master, Hoffman's dynamic acting style never was and never will be. 4. Edward Norton- the king of dystopian genre. Nortons mono tone voice in Fight Club helped Finchers classing become the greatest dystopian film ever. Norton also had an unforgettable role in American History X where he plays a ruthless skin head attempting to repent. Nortan taps into our dark feelings he's the dark whisper in our ears. 5. Hearh Ledger- he didn't play in much because he died yo soon. But ledger revolutionized what it meant to give it all you got. In the Dark Knight his potrayal of the Joker made us urinate in our popcorn. Will never see something like him again! 6. Al Pacino- ""say hello to my little friend!"".This dude dominated the big screen for three decades and played the effing Godfather. He went from being the cold calculated Michael Corleone to the impulsive sociopath Tony Montana. 7.Jimmy Stewart-  before Brando took the crown of Hollywood legend their was this guy. Stewart aka Goerge Bailey represented the true American for two decades. He's always the lone righteous guy standing up against the overwhelming evil. Nobody knows but he also played in a lot of westerns where he proved he wasn't just a great actor, but he also knew how to be a gun slinger. 8. Marlon Brando- ""I coulda been a contender"", Brando was right if he hadn't turned down every movie offer. Although he played in a lot of crap his few explosive roles earned him the title ""greatest actor of all time"". He's attributed for bringing ""realism"" to acting, it's hard to say if that's true but one thing for sure Vito Corleone is bad ass. 9. Kevin Spacey- he may be a fucking sicko but he was the king of the screen for two decades. Playing in films such as seven, the usual suspects and American beauty Spacey has become an icon. He makes us squirm laugh and piss. He's just the god damn Ralph Underwood of movies motherfuckas. 10. Leonardo DiCaprio- the greatest actor of the 21st century DiCaprios diverse roles leaves our mouths hanging open. From playing teen sensation Jack in Titanic to Cobb in Inception DiCaprio carries on the torch of De Niro, Pacino, and Brando",0,1,The Fight Club Podcast,dZOaI_Fn5o4,0.058168962029256165,2018-04-22 17:06:43,False,False

Truly terrible film so my advice to Blade Runner fans is basically avoid this sequel that will be forgotten in 20 years and was poorly done and just stick to the original Blade Runner made in 1982 by Ridley Scott because Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford smashed it in that film and Blade Runner even today in 2020 remains fresh, original and just an awesome display of talent and film making to the point it's still a classic. This sequel will be nothing more than a dinosaur's fossilized turd in the next few years.",1,3,Steve Mitchell,dZOaI_Fn5o4,0.07017543859649124,2020-02-16 13:55:51,False,False
