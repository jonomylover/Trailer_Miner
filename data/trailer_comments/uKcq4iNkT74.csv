2016-01-24T07:08:46,Ppl. If u think it'll be a good movie. Cool. If u don't. Cool. But don't go around tryin to fit yo stupid ass arguments over race rn. It's a movie that specifically tailors to the black community. There are a lot of movies that are for a certain demographic.. Get over it. Don't say shit bout black ppl or white ppl. Or anybody.
