There is a straight arrow in my pants due to the originality of this concept. James Cameron would roll over in his grave if he knew he could have worked on this movie instead of the 16 Avatar sequels he had planned. If this this isn't 3D we all will riot the streets wearing green. Imagine having an arrow coming right at you in the 3rd dimension. You would die. I'll die if they don't make this movie in 3D. I will purchase the 4K High Definition Box set with the collectable Robin Hood Figurines. It will be on my nightstand next to my bed and I will kiss it goodnight before I go to sleep every night for the rest of my goddamn life. I will say however, that they should have cast Russell Crowe. Why was this never done. Ridley Scott was too busy jerking off to Alien porn that he forgot to cast the God of Crows in a Robin Hood epic that would give any Gladiator to ever exist a sore rectum. The Academy Awards will be ransacked by this film. Robin himself would make an appearance, because this movie is real. Every Academy Award from 2018-3946 would be given to this movie because it would cause every volcano on earth to simultaneously erupt with pure semen. Roland Emmerich could not capture the magnificent scale of these volcano orgasms. He would, however, wonder why he never thought of a disaster movie staring Robin Hood himself to save the day. Who else would the scientists turn to in their time of need, but the King of Thieves? You can't destroy the earth if Robin steals the weather. I can see it now, 'National Treasure 3: King of Thieves.' ""It's simple, we steal the ozone."" Boom. $14 Billion right there. Easily. Nic Cage gets back on top like he has always deserved.

No one in the 21st century gives a shit about Robin Hood! There is a reason why Hawkeye is not getting a solo film. Gun obsessed Americans don't give two shits about bandits with arrows. You want to make a Robin Hood film. Here assholes I will give you a free idea because I actually do this shit. Set the goddamn film in 2084. Make corporations completely out of control and Robin with his band of merry domestic terrorists as they are portrayed by the media. Fight guerilla battle after battle destroying the physical infrastructure of major companies in an effort to not only hurt the companies but inspire his country and even the world to fight back against the monopoly.

We may be a minority but there are some people who still prefer reality to the shallow fantasy agendas of Hollywood and the elite globalists who control this output via 5 or 6 corporations. However most people in the West have been brainwashed into accepting comfortable lies (unrealistic action flicks is just one example) over harsh truth (911 was an inside job) because it's easier to sit and eat popcorn rather than question and be a critical thinker.

There, a young boy called Eggsy gains his live at the streets by thieving to everybody, not the rich, nor the poor, everybody. One day, Eggsy steals something important to the greatest bounty hunter who has ever lived, Mr. Django Freeman. Then Django tracks down Eggsy's footprints and follows him to London, place where the young boy was selling this McGuffin. Django, angered by this, reclutes Eggsy to go with him in his own buissness. Django promises Eggsy to set him free until he pays what he debts or get killed, whateaver happens first. At this part of the story, we met the other raiders that eventually will for the outlaw group called The Kingsmen. Django trains Eggsy and teaches him the exquisite art of arrowing (Like if yoy catched the reference.) to prepare him with the struggle with Sheriff Krennick, who's power is getting bigger and badder. It is also revealed that Krennick's actions as sheriff caused Hildie's decease. That's why Django wants to kill and rob him. Django and his band starts to rob Nottingham's soldiers and Sheriff's men. Then they get the atenttion of our villain and start to get unsuccessfully hunted down. At the climax of the story, The Kingsmen, leadered by Django, sneaks into Krennick's house and steals all of his. The Sheriff then wokes because of this and starts to fight the thieves with his guards by his side. In the duel, Django gets hurted by Krennick's sword. Then Django shots Krennick at his british balls... This is for my Broomhilda, motherfucker!!! and bang. Krennick never talked again. The Kingsmen leave out the castle but they are intercepted by a bunch of furious pesants who heared all the noise of the castle. The crowd throws bombs to the thieves. Django gets hit by a bomb and killed in the process. Eggsy and the others miraculously escapes the scene. At the end, some weeks later, Eggsy and the other Kingsmen are travelling into the woods where they find a reward poster in one of the trees. The drawing in the poster is the one of Eggsy's face. ""Robin Hood... Who the hell is Robin Hood!? I think it's your outlaw name. Do you think they'll put something like Eggsy? ...Robin Hood... I think I like it... hahaha, of course you dumbass, I told you!"" Then, Robin and the others ride away leaving the tree and the poster.

It's as bad as you think.  -Action is cut like a Marvel movie -Robin has his damn mask off half the time he's in battle and somehow his identity isn't given away -Yes, Marion is actually wearing that outfit in the movie. -Molotov cocktails in the era of Robin Hood where he fights in the Crusades. That happened -The comic relief friar character (Tillman was it?) is utterly lame -Robin gets an arrow TO THE HEART in the climax, Marion pulls it out, and he lives WITHOUT MEDICAL ATTENTION -Whoever directed this film thinks that a small trail of flammable fluid on the ground creates a huge inferno -John just ""apparates"" where the movie needs him to be. He's somehow on the boat back to England in the opening, then he's somehow masquerading as the Sheriff's guard in the climax (the last time we saw John before that scene, he'd found the room in the prison where the guards kept their armor. We don't even see how he made his way into the guard. We don't even know how he knew that Robin had willingly let himself be captured so that the Sheriff could have him executed. He's just...THERE) -Apparently the townsfolk call him ""The Hood"" because the director thinks that 13th century Englishmen have cool nicknames for noble people like him. -Nobody even attempts to talk Middle English. -There's basically a Canto Bight scene in the middle of the movie where they're gambling on 13th century roulette wheels and throwing weird-shaped dice and it honestly looks like some extravagant Vegas party. -For literally no reason, John forbids Robin from talking to Marion at the start of the movie...which gets forgotten within 15 minutes because after that point, Robin and Marion are having regular conversations and John doesn't give a shit.

If Robin Hood was real, any evidence available shows he existed between the years 1150 and 1350. Therefore, BLACKS played NO role in English history when these events supposedly took place.  They were still in Africa with bones through their noses and chucking spears at lions and each other.

2018-11-27T06:11:47,"As usual, Hollywood does its best to make Christianity look it's worst. The sad part about a lot of what they portrayed, had a lot of truth to it. But here in lies the problem, the atrocities and the hypocrisy that this movie tries to put upon Christianity, needs to be clarified. This was Catholicism, not true Christianity. Although there are a lot of very good-hearted loving people that claim to be Catholic, the Catholic hierarchy is responsible for 95% of everything negative throughout history associated with Christianity. True Christianity is not about a church, it's about a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, whether it be the Crusades or the inquisition's or the many number of doctrines that the Catholic Church manipulated from the original Greek, Latin and Hebrew text, written primarily by the disciples, and I'm referring to the New Testament, and which they attitude or took away or manipulated the original meaning of what was actually supposed to be. But Hollywood is constantly doing this, so many times, the villain, the bad guy, is the far-right Christian, or should I say the far-right white Christian. They do this so often, that is getting very hard, as someone who loves Jesus, to actually be able to watch a movie and enjoy it. This is all part about the Bible clearly tells us that will happen approaching the time of the Great Tribulation. For any of you Christians out there, and I'm talking about people who truly have love and admiration and follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, you should not enjoy watching this movie. They could have made this movie very interesting and enjoyable to watch, but instead, they choose to do otherwise , by once again, putting a very bad, dark light on Christianity. It seems like 70 to 80% of every movie made, at some point during the movie, takes a shot at Christianity, yet at the same time, put a very good like on a religion like Islam, which by the way, is anything but a religion of love and peace. They're book, the Quran, tells the good Muslim or follower of Islam, that is their Duty, to kill the infidel, it says this 56 different times, so does that sound like a religion of peace and love? I think not. Their book tells them that if anyone does not submit to Islam, or convert to Islam, you are considered to be an infidel, and again, 56 different times it tells the follower of Islam to murder that infidel! As Christians, we need to start speaking back and letting people know that the way they are portraying Christianity is uncalled for and unsubstantiated. Again, I'm not trying to be mean to Catholicism, but the actions of the hierarchy, and this goes all the way to the top, the Pope, have done so many things to hurt what it means to actually be a Christian, just so they could acquire as much power and money as they could. There is a reason why the Catholic religion is losing thousands and thousands of former members every year. They are starting to realize and recognize how debaucherous their religion has become. People want to know the truth, and the truth is, that if you want to experience what true Christianity is all about, then know this, it's about you realizing that we all are sinners, and whenever there is sin, there has to be judgment, and therefore a penalty. Unlike any other religion, our God, Jesus, took the penalty upon himself and paid the price for our sins! In every other religion, you have to try to do enough things or be good enough that hopefully your false god will find your Deeds good enough. But the problem is, if you sin one single time, that makes you imperfect, which makes it impossible to be in the presence of a perfect God. Because Jesus sacrificed himself, and because he was sinless, he became a perfect sacrifice, a perfect payment, for our sin. And as long as we believe in him, and allow him to live in US, to guide us, God the Father, allows us to be in his presence, because we have been made perfect, through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. If you haven't done so, there's no better time than right now, to get on your knees, and sincerely ask for forgiveness of your sins, and ask Jesus to live in you and guide you, and he will be faithful to do so. for those of you who claim to be atheist, I just want to give you a little something to think about. If you are right, and I am wrong, then when we die, they put us in a box, put us in the ground, and then we rot. But if I am right, and you are wrong, then when we die, I will be going to heaven, I will live in Paradise, and regretfully, you will be headed for Eternal darkness and destruction, the key word there being,,, eternal! This is forever! Are you willing to take a chance, even if it's a 1% chance, that I am right and you are wrong. And besides, by accepting and following Jesus, you get the live eternally in heaven, it will also make life as fulfilling as possible, beyond imagination, while you're here in the flesh. I'm not saying that everything's always hunky dory and you never have any troubles, because we live in a sinful world, ugly, terrible things are going to happen. But if you have Jesus living in you, he has your back, you will never truly be alone! Please make the right decision, not because I'm asking you to, it's because Jesus wants you to answer him, you going to have all the money in the world, and still feel empty, that emptiness needs to be filled by Jesus. The highest percentage of a group of people that commit suicide, are the richest people financially in the world. All the treasures & Gold, will not make you truly happy.

2020-05-04T21:33:22,"So for people that complain about the black character, i think there was a black in the original too with pretty much the same backstory. Also i think robin hood was pretty liberal so it's not weird that it has that whole antifa vibe. BUT the main issue with this movie is, since they were not about to make a medieval themed movie, WTF didn't they just simply made a robin hood futuristic remake? I mean they just made everything to seem modern with medieval stuff. For example, the scene with the horses could be a motorcycle scene, or the casino scene and mostly the final fight with the policemen/knights with globs instead of swords and square shields. They could name it something like ""Robin Hood 2077"" and it could take place in a post apocalyptic world were there is not electricity or guns and were  feudarchy came back and it would be much more interesting.",0,0,_sic_ ness,zwPn9ZnbCo0,0.10694444444444445,2020-05-04 21:33:22,False,False
