2017-06-13T04:15:43,"0:48 Ghaul is right, though. With the Traveler's Light, Guardians effectively fight like (ironically enough) gamers. We may have fought seriously for the first few years of existence, but we've probably just been going through the motions for the past century. Sure, there are darkness zones that forces us redo everything, but the fact that death isn't permanent kind off takes the edge off of everything that a Guardian does. Ghaul, on the other hand, has put his life on the line time and time again in order to prove his worth. A warrior who fights like he has everything to lose always wins, and the Light would make him effectively unstoppable. The perfect warrior.

Then, a cinematic will show your character, waken up somewhere in the city. You will start to look around to see death upon the civilians and your fellow guardians. You picked up a weapon from the guardian and start to move. But, just as you were about head out and seek the others, a group of red legion cabal start heading towards you and thus surrounds you. You will end up getting really hurt from the ambush and you have no choice but to surrender. When you surrender, one of the cabal knocks you out and take you to ghaul's ship. When you wake up, you find yourself strains and couldn't move but you manage to escape somehow and begin to attempt an escape. As you try to find your way, you found yourself in empty throne room with the view of the traveler. You look at the traveler for a bit thn the huge device tht was on the traveler was activated and it covers up the whole traveler. This videos starting cinematic a goes of and ghaul kicks you off the ledge into your death. But you didn't die, you somehow survive and weak. You ended up somewhere in the city again but this time, right where the red legion is. You will have to sneak pass the red legion cabals and make your way out of the city. You escaped the city.

Now in Destiny 2, there is a story. From what we have seen, our home gets invaded. The tower destroyed, and the light taken from us. Obstacles to overcome, and something to fight for.  This is our darkest hour, and now that we are weak we have something to fear. Though since the game isn't released yet it is bit early to say whether this game will be good or bad but from everything that has been revealed to us so far, it really is a change from how the 1st Destiny started out.

They're just awkwardly hanging there. It looks extremely fucking awkward. Almost like he should be holding a gun or crossing his arms or something, or throw the guardian around. But instead they are just hanging there awkwardly not moving, like he's extremely socially awkward. And the part where he kicks the guardian and then kicks him off the ledge looks so stupid too, because during that his fat, obese arms are just still, awkwardly hanging there. Who's fucking idea was this? Why is this Santa Claus Bane looking fuck coming in here with his stereotypical villain attitude, acting all socially awkward, only able to fight people with his feet. What, will the boss battle be him just trying to kick us with melee damage? That would be fun. And why is the titan he's talking to look SO fucking generic? His armor looks like the Pre-alpha sketches they drew. You couldn't have tried to make the guardian look unique, with cool armor? Instead just make him look the make the most boring and un-detailed as you could? Thanks for showing us a trailer for a game with 2009 graphics, in the year 2017.

Next, the name Borealis, or Boreas in Latin, is north wind or God of North Wind & Winter in Greek (from what I could find). Also, one of the 4 seasonal Anemoi (Wind-Gods) in Greek. Okay, that's kinda cool. So does it change through all 4 winds err elements by  design? If this is Borealis 03... is there a 01, 02 and 04 in different frames ie different winds? If they exist, do all of these types of weapons now change damage type (or is it 4 different damage types one for each seasonal wind)?

FUCK no! go die bungie and Activision. hope both your lying and stealing scummy companies crashes and disappears forever you scumbags!!!! please boycot these companies that gives us shitty deals and steals our money by not buying their crap. Destiny 2 is the repeat of the same crap destiny 1. disappointment ahead. you've been warned. these companies think with their wallets not brain. show them how we don't want segmented games where you get the full game first after you've forced to pay 4 times the price of any AAA game after being forced to purchase every new expansion but at the end not owning anything but a disc that says you can't access servers!!! this got to stop and the only way is not buying the shit these companies are giving us. ,0,0,DHSNAKE,D8E7jUjOQi0,-0.19515269886363637,2017-06-13 17:00:48,True,True

Meaning you could fight the same boss (but stronger) later on in the story as you did early on? Wouldnt that also mean you will have to take back the traveler before fighting ghaul so he doesnt come back? Maybe you kill him once but he comes back?   4: Bungie will kill off a character. But who you ask? Probably Cayde-6 because he is the most loved character. It will probably be in an intense fire fight and cayde saves you and gets killed, or in an epic 1v1 between cayde and ghaul. Either way it would be a sad death. But why cayde? Why not someone else (yes I would cry too)? Because cayde is the most loved character and if they killed zavala or the warlock girl (idk her name) no body will care they would just be like..""hmph, they killed him..

2018-12-25T21:07:57,"BUNGIE has EFFECTIVELY fucked over SO MANY CONSUMERS that their DLC LAUNCHES garnish their reputation with more “shitty opinions of them” than any other game that’s been out since 2014. They’ve throttled consumers experience up to 94% TOWARDS THE EXACT IN-GAME REWARDS THEY SELL AS A MICROTRANSACTION FOR REAL MONEY, and AFTER consumers paid cash for exp boosts Bungie throttling up to 94% of consumers earning in-game rewards nullified WHAT people paid for... essentially making what they bought USELESS. When they got caught doing THAT, they stated they’d fix the game “to show the correct experience”... and after they were caught negating all of what you earn Bungies top dog Jason Jones then DOUBLED the in game experience that you are required to earn FOR the EXACT IN-GAME REWARD BUNGIE SELLS AS A MICROTRANSACTION.  That’s all on top of LOCKING PLAYERS ON PC OUT OF VANILLA CONTENT THEY BOUGHT, and LOCKING CONSOLE PLAYERS OUT OF VANILLA CONTENT THEY BOUGHT.... and putting in game notifiers that say “BUY THE NEW DLCs in order to access the stuff you already paid-FOR from us”.  But the DLCs you have to buy to RE-ACCESS the stuff you already paid for.... you have to buy ALL OF THE DLCs WITH DLCs you didn’t buy ALL-TOGETHER .  So if the in game notice says “you need this dlc to RE-access this content you already bought,  you are REQUIRED TO BUY ALL THE DLCs you ALREADY BOUGHT WITH THE DLC YIU DIDNT BUY, BECAUSE BUNGIE WONT SELL ANY DLC BY ITSELF, so YOU HAVE TO BUY A GROUP IF DLCs “JUST TO BUY IND DLC, IN ORDER TO RE-ACCESS WHAT YOU ALREADY PAID FOR.  In other words...  Buy ALL THESE, or you are LOCKED out of WHAT YOU ALREADY BOUGHT.
