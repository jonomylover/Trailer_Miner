2016-04-09T18:11:34,This movie was really bad. Melissa McCarthy proves once again that she cannot write a screenplay. She wrote Tammy and now The Boss. Both these movies are total misfires and have no funny jokes. The only good thing about this movie is really that Michelle (Melissa McCarthy) in the movie has a goal to find out that family is everything. The other main character has a goal to discover her own self worth through owning a new company. This makes for some good chemistry and a pretty good friendship. Sadly though everything else in the movie is total crap.   I make movie reviews on my channel if you want to check them out.

I felt like something was extracting my life energy and was allowing me just to breathe so i can finish this atrocious piece of horse shit. Abysmal film in every sense of the word. Terrible characters, cartoonish plot that is insulting cartoons, contrived so much it hurts, story does not make any sense, even in those over the top ludacris type stories, it is not FUNNY, it is lame and obnoxious . Please do not see this if you already haven't. It is so depressing borderline repulsive. 0/5",0,0,ogorjefan,yakeigyf0vc,-0.39249999999999996,2016-08-04 14:28:17,False,False
