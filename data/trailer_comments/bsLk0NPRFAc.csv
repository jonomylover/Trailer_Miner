This is the way I see it; when you break down this concept, it's can seem really goofy & at the same time be scary & I like that it looks like they are going to take it a little serious but also have some goofy/cheesy stuff in the film. When looking at the goofy & scary concept, I don't want this film to try to take itself too serious. I want it to come in & know what type of film it is & play up to it. I don't look at this film & expect it to be a great film or be the next Jaws, even though some have called it to be Jaws for the next generation, I don't see it like that. My expectations on it being great are low. I'm just looking for a fun & entertaining monster movie. I do hope that the film has a mixture of both humor & horror. I don't want the film to have more of one & less of the other. I want the mixture. They can mix well if you do it right. I want it to kinda be like Deep Blue Sea. Say what you want, but that movie was goofy & cheesy but at the same time, it was entertaining. As long as this film can be an entertaining monster flick then I'll be fine with it. I don't want the film to take it self too serious to the point where you can't have fun with it.  EDIT: Also a movie trailer can be edited to look completely different from the actual movie.

2018-04-10T04:04:34,"Honestly, as a huge fan of the book series since my high school days, I like what I'm seeing so far, but I'm also a little hesitant. Everyone knows when books are translated to film, there will inevitably be some changes made to condense a few hundred page novel to a two and a half hour movie, that's just the way the industry is. But I'm really hoping that they haven't drastically altered the storyline. Without spoiling the book plot for anyone who hasn't read them yet or risk saying what may spoil the film's possible story, the first book has some pivotal characters, such as Jonas Taylor's (Statham's character) estranged wife Maggie and DJ among others, who push the plot forward, and lead to several major character's deaths which act as the catalyst for the story's climax, which, if they stuck to, that is going to be amazing to see on screen, I gotta say. And I hope they didn't change the ending either, which literally serves as the jump to the sequels (Hint, hint, fellow fans. Angel. All I've gotta say) But I'm going to keep a cautious optimism for this movie, since it's taken over a decade at least to finally be released. But I hope they didn't change or alter too much of the story. And one thing: please, for the love of GOD, don't let them have watered this down to a PG-13 rating just so they can profit from the teenage demographic.

Many species of shark are endangered and few people show sympathy for them. Take for example the grey nurse shark which is harmless to humans, people will still kill this beautiful animal despite it being harmless because people see the fin and think ""maneater"". The idea of the movie is ridiculous because if an animal that large had remained undetected for so long obviously it would be uninterested in doing what is shown in this trailer, if it were this agressive it would have been found and killed long ago.

But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.",4,1,Yawn fk,bsLk0NPRFAc,0.26684220251293417,2018-04-11 03:23:49,True,True

Others first found in the 70's or later include a horse, pig, deer, zebra, ape, whale and a species of hammerhead shark. Tales of the giant squid floated since the late 1800's but no photographic proof existed until 2004. The Megamouth shark, similar to basking and whale sharks, growing to some 20 geet, was only discovered in the 1970's and since then less than 100 have been observed in the wild. Given how little we know about the Earth, esp. the oceans, it is possible that this species still exists down deep. There are certainly animals still around large enough to be sufficient prey including the largest ever blue whale. We all know about all the old arctic whaling stations so is it possible the whales went there because the waters were too cold for the Meg to follow?

They even base a part of its behavior on what modern sharks do at the beginning scene, where though it may have been looking like it was going after the girl, it was actually doing a test bite to see if the facility was edible, deemed it not being so, and left it alone.

If I had made this film, I rather see Huge Jackman in the leading role. The story would be about a family fishing trip gone wrong as his wife an kids go missing, and never seen again. This tragic event happens while he was commanding secret Navy Seal missions overseas. He rushes back only to return to a shattered life and home. Its 2am the last stages of depression start to set in, his hand shaking while reaching for his firearm .. He sits in his bedroom, dark and silhouetted by a TV ambience. He begins grinding his pistol into his temple cursing himself for the fact of not being there to protect his family.. He takes his last breath and slowly pulls the trigger. This is a BREAKING NEWS REPORT!!! .. He slowly turns his head as sweat drips from his nose... Anchor: Good evening, we have just received word that yet another family boating disaster has occurred. This happens in the same area, but this time there are still remains of the boat to be seen by the news helicopter spotlights. The dark ocean waters reveal what looks to be a rather large white yacht missing its rear half. The reporter ends the report with comments leading to what looks like some kind of unexplained animal attack. With this report, Hugh Jackman's mission of revenge begins. Buckle Up as he seeks revenge on a underestimated foe of our ocean's deep dark history.

(1) Judging by this shitty trailer, it appears the studio not only took the science interwoven throughout the book out of the movie, but also took the damn book out of it altogether. The entire appeal of the MEG series is the fact we don't know (yet) what lays in the deepest trenches of the ocean, but we do know it's likely luminescent. The author's meticulous scientific details were obviously not employed on even a rudimentary level; the damn shark isn't white much less glowing! Frankly, it looks like a giant turd with teeth.   (2) Whatever ""genius"" writer decided to compile a brilliant series into 1 movie truly did a disservice to MEG fans. Why did you bother naming it MEG when you went straight to book 2, The Trench? And even then you still didn't stick to the book! It's as if you took bits from MEG and pieces from The Trench and Frankensteined the shit out of them.   (3) I hope that ""music"" is not the score.  Studios really need to stop turning books into movies because you end up disappointing fans every time. You'll spend a jillion dollars making another tired superhero movie, but utterly ruin brilliant science fiction that could have appealed to ALL demographics and not just 12-year-old boys. With the exception of Get Out, I can't remember the last time I paid to see a film, but MEG won't be the one that gets me into the theater.

You can tell the movie was filmed in a giant pool for most scenes. The CGI was not the best , but it was the best it could be for a B movie shark flick, however this was not a cheap B movie it was an expensive $150 million dollar flop. Deep blue sea is by far better as is the original Jaws. If they used animatronics for this movie you would probably be looking at a $500 million dollar budget. The story line was stupid but it has some very nice scenes and funny punch lines. Megalodon was 70-90 feet? Megalodon feared nothing? Hahaha Only 2 references made to the Killer whales, the creatures responsible in part for megalodon extinction.

And while the reviews aren't as universally bad as they were for ""Gotti"" or ""The Emoji Movie"", the bad reviews are delightfully harsh. We've gathered the snarkiest snippets below:      ""How do you make a blockbuster movie starring a superhuman action star and a giant prehistoric monster that's so deadly dull?"" [Rolling Stone]      ""'The Meg' is a one hundred percent inorganic meal, something made from pre-tasted and then regurgitated ingredients."" [Hollywood Reporter]      ""Just observing that 'The Meg' is a dead, lifeless film is easy. All you have to do is sit there and watch for 10 minutes, any 10 minutes."" [SFGate]      ""Of all the thrillers made about tender, juicy humans splashing away from ravenous giant sharks, 'The Meg' is undeniably the most recent."" [NPR]       ""[S]harks deserve better than this."" [IndieWire]      ""It is neither dumb nor smart enough to be fun, and spends way too much time with its boring human characters when it could be spending it with, you know, the giant shark.""

Citizen Kane?  Its a giant fucking shark movie, suspend your disbelief, fuck) Alot of these bad reviews seem to be nothing but hollow points from these ""film critics"". Its a fun shark movie, nothing more, nothing less, you dont have to like it, but if you are going to critique it ACTUALLY CRITIQUE IT.   Theres plenty of legit things to critisize in the movie, but all the critics best arguments seem to be ""Needs more blood and cheese"" or ""Its a shark movie, therefore it must be at least as bad as Sharknado for it to be any good"" or ""You expect me to believe this shit?"" Yet they will suspend their disbelief for Marvel movies, Jurassic World Kong, ect. Ect. All of which have as little or less plot substance than The Meg.  Fucking ametures. I miss Siskel and Ebert.

Mosasaurus: Mosasaurus hoffmannii, the largest known species, may have reached up to 17 m (56 ft) in length  ¬†(source wikipedia)   but with further research i found that the Mosasaurus had a long, thin body with jaws designed more for feeding on smaller prey such as ammonites and fish ...   the Megalodon instead had a much more robust body and huge jaws built for devouring whales and other large marine mammals. A Mosasaurus would not have been able to get its jaws around the much thicker body of the Megalodon. It would just take one catastrophic bite for the Megalodon to end the battle. In addition the Mosasaur‚Äôs body type would have been inefficient for high-speed swimming giving the Megalodon another huge advantage in maneverablity.  ¬†https://www.fossilera.com/blog/megalodon-vs-mosasaurs-who-would-win",1,0,Ben the mighty,bsLk0NPRFAc,0.1459077380952381,2019-01-10 01:34:24,False,False
