Dom will ride into battle  in a T Rex, he will be accompanied by raptors on surf boards which will be ridden by baddies that'll shoot RPG s at the submarine.  They're looking for a pyramid buried deep in the antarctic ocean where they will awaken Doms dad,  who is also supermans father. Letty is really his sister,  who he's been banging -  the white woman he now works for is his mother,  the only other woman in the universe that can tell Dom what to do.  Superceding Letty,  obviously.  The rock will eventually turn into a vampire,  which will then cause blade to enter the series in the 11th movie. The guy from the dos x's commercials will also be featured.  Unbeknownst to anyone,  they're all trapped in an alternate universe that is hanging around in a kitty cats collar -  a universe where a replica of voldemort soul is being kept safe.  Harry Potter is actually in the next movie,  disguised as one of the black guys -  can't tell you which,  that'd be giving away too much.",1,0,vash347,JwMKRevYa_M,0.029166666666666667,2016-12-12 03:22:05,True,True

He's not here so I guess Vin is the nest ideal candidate being his background in action movie(Riddick,XXX) etc. This plot is quite reminiscent of F6,hmm maybe they're losing their mojo.

This is the only explanation as to why Brian wouldn't come in and take dom down himself. Obviously this would be borderline disrespectful and would probably piss off a lot of fans.

These films were sort of off my radar as i'm not really a racing enthusiast. I didn't really engage with the franchise til a friend of mine dragged me to the cinema in 2014 and on an action movie, humor and emotional level I enjoyed that very much and then i went back and watched the first 6 and really enjoyed those too. That's probably why I'm not too concerned with the less street racing more action approach. In terms of an exciting and unpredictable place of taking the franchise this looks good to me. Even if they are mainly vehicular mayhem and action nowadays, you gotta admit that they do what they do spectacularly and to still keep the emotional core of the family center stage that's impressive for an action franchise for it to have that much on it's mind. Hell I'll watch it, just for the action but the drama looks pretty intense too.

2016-12-12T13:28:09,"Legit garbage. Let's be honest here: The only reason anyone would want to see this, is to prove that they were right about how he'll really turn out to be a good person, but was pretending to be bad all along to get that Charlize's character out of the way. Other than that, why would anyone wanna see this movie? They really should have ended it with the last one. That movie ended in a way which imo, was a good farewell to all the characters that are still alive, along with the series as a whole.   Then, we're told they're making another one which at first sounded awesome and cool, but by looking at this trailer, it's clear they've ran out of ideas and legit had to make Dom the bad guy to keep the story going? It sure the hell wasn't because it sounded like a great idea on paper. There were so many ways they could have gone with this, and they picked such a cheap and unoriginal idea to make yet another movie of the series.   But, sadly enough, this movie will sell well because it's a series that everyone loves (including me). Just don't like where they've went with this one.

As for F8 I have no idea what the fuck they are doing for this. I like the idea of Shaw having to work with them but I really can't see why Dom would turn on them especially after Letty just getting her memory back and such. I suppose it'll be answered in F9.

First and foremost i would like to thank god for giving me this opportunity. Next i would like to thank my parents. I want to thank my friend Peter Griffin for being really skinny and always there for me. I would also like to thank my pet tadpole for surviving for over a week. Next i would like to thank the squirrel that lives in my backyard for climbing trees because that gives me inspiration that i need to get through the day. This is a special moment in my life and i would like to thank any of my unmentioned friends and family that have helped me along the way. This moment will be a moment that I will never forget. I just remembered a few other people i would like to thank; Abraham Lincoln, the fish I caught in the third grade, my light in my room because i wouldn’t be able to see the keyboard without it, the internet for letting me go on Youtube, my house because without it i would be homeless, and last but not least i would like to thank all the people out there that actually took time out of their day to read this. I cannot stress how much of a big deal to me this is. I have been trying to be the first on a post for years, but that has not been possible until this amazing day. Hopefully my good luck will continue, but this is undoubtedly a rare occasion. If you asked me how I did this, I would say, you can achieve anything you set your mind on.

Since Thanksgiving I have randomly walk up to 3 people at the register and paid for their groceries.   Yesterday a lady started crying, she pulled the front of her top down and showed me a huge scare on her chest. She had a emergency open heart surgery 3 weeks ago. The largest vein in her body had burst. She died in surgery and by prayer of her family and God she was saved by the doctors.  She told me that she was buying Christmas for her daughter. She said she is on a limited income and was worried about spending that much money. She and her daughter were crying. The cashier was crying and so was I and my daughter Fia.   I will say this again, I want no attention from this! I am just ISSUING A WALMART CHALLENGE! I can not out give God! God is Good all the time, and I was more blessed by her story and my ability to help her then anything I could have given!

I know it seems brilliant to make him turn on his family as it will add for HUGE suspense and a plot twist, but honestly there is too strong of an attraction to the fans and Don that makes this franchise great. His connection to the Fast and Furious family is what made this series so unique and appreciable. Now, Dom turning on his family (even if he comes back to them) completely defeats the purpose of the series and contradicts what the fans love completely. I miss the old Fast and Furious where they would drive Tuners, race and do jobs because they loved it. Now, there's always SOMETHING that comes in the way. There is something that ALWAYS interferes. Don't get me wrong, I still like Fast 7 and 6, and I will probably enjoy this one nonetheless, but my heart will always be with the original five Fast and Furious movies (Fast Five was my favourite).

It looks like they picked the worst movie so far in the series - the second - and said: hey let's do this again, but without the car tuning scene stuff. While not being a total letdown it didn't felt like a F&F movie at all. But instead of going back to the roots they are just riding the same horse over and over again. Each and every F&F movie since then seems to be like the fifth but its get stupider with each instalment. The sixth was almost unbearably stupid. I watched the 7th only because I wanted to see how they deal with Pauls death. I wish I didn't. Unless some wonder happens I'll pass on the 8th and all the crap that's probably about to come with the F&F label.",0,0,in.ex.posed,JwMKRevYa_M,0.01442307692307693,2016-12-16 00:46:34,True,True

2017-04-01T01:38:04,"I think it needs to be said that a lot of what ends up in movie trailers is also what hit the cutting room floor. I've seen plenty of trailers that had scenes or shots that weren't even in the final cut of the movie. While you're right that these are continuity issues keep in mind that they likely won't show up in the cinema version. Also, with regard to the 30mm canon being shot from the roof of the SUV, it is very likely that the spent rounds were added for affect as it doesn't look like the canon is even dispensing any spent rounds. That and the fact that they get thrown further than what the edge of the vehicle is and the vehicle is moving at a high rate of speed so they would end up behind the point of release not in front. They are also very hot. So the real thing would have likely scorched the top of the vehicle and the actor.",0,0,CanWay Technology,JwMKRevYa_M,0.019336734693877557,2017-04-01 01:38:04,True,True

This movie is about family and cars just like the previous Fast and the Furious movies but the trailer of this sequel showed the betrayal of Dom. The special effects was wonderful; you will see it in every scene but watch the scene with the submarine and cool cars. The storyline was unpredictable; I thought Dom betrayed the team because of Cypher but it was not. I'm not going to spoil that's why I'm not going to tell it. I felt the goosebumps in the end (spoiler alert) because Dom named his child Bryan. That made me teary.

Fast forward few months later, a funeral for Vin and Charlize was held but no one attended it, let alone the cast, the crew, their friends and ""family"".
