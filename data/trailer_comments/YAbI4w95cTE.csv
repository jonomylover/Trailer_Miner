And then we have Godzilla V Kong in 2020 which will be the finale   so expect end credits at the end of Kong Skull Island teasing the whereabouts of Godzilla in preparation for Godzilla 2 in March 2019.

Or he has really big hands, much bigger than his head. Or the ape shown at 2:04 is not really Kong, but a ""smaller"" ape? Which means that the handprint at 1:03 belongs to the real Kong.  Because if the ape at 2:04 is really Kong....then that's waaay too small. Probably only 100-150feet tall maximum. Which would be too small to fight against Godzilla.  Unless if by the time Kong fights Godzilla in the 21st century, he magically doubles or triples his size. To double his size in 40-50 years? Seems very unlikely (but then again, we don't how old Kong is in the new movie. If he grew to his current size in 40-50 years, then it may be possible, but that would mean he's just a little kid ape in the new reboot movie. Lol. But if he's already an ""adult"" in the reboot, it doesn't seem very likely for him to double/triple his size by the time he fights Godzilla.)  Unless if the Kong vs. Godzilla movie is to be set before the 21st century, and Godzilla is smaller....waaay smaller.  In any case, this movie seems promising. Looking forward to it.

Great to see Tom Hiddleston finally playing a hero on the big screen instead of the usual villainous evildoer that he normally portrays on film!!! Somebody here actually mentioned that he looks a bit like Uncharted hero Nathan Drake!!! You know I can totally see him as Nathan if Sony were to make serious plans towards adapting Uncharted to film :)     But what confuses me a bit is that this new King Kong movie is a WB picture instead of a Universal film!!! Universal owns King Kong don't they??? So if that's the case, how is WB able to shoot a movie whose rights are actually owned by a rival studio???

In fact, I haven't been onboard with this new direction they're taking one of my most beloved characters ever since I heard about this project. This isn't King Kong at all. This is an oversized, inaccurate portrayal of Kong in order to make him into another Kaiju monster able to fight Godzilla on-screen in a few more years. These two characters come from two entirely different types of fiction to begin with. Godzilla is a 1950s era, atomic age/space age science fiction character with the ability to destroy the entire human race. King Kong is from the early 20th century era of ""lost world"" fiction— a genre more about adventure, exploration, and using new technologies to discover lands that time forgot. There's nothing these two stalwarts have in common other than being very big and primal. But Godzilla isn't just ""big"" like Kong; Godzilla is enormous! Kong is really only about 28 ft tall, whereas Godzilla is 400+ ft tall and has atomic breath.

Has a lot personnality - Great trailer overall, doesn't spoil too much - Great score - The added military variable is actually not a bad idea. - Two great actors : Samuel and John  What worries me: - More action but less emotion. The original was a reflection on humanities destructive nature. This one looks more like an action brawl. - I loved the trailers of Godzilla as well but the final movie, while not a failure, was still very disappointing (Bad pacing, non-sense story, The only memorable character is killed off within the first act, boring protagonist). For some reason, the movies with the best trailers have a tendancy to overhype and disappoint in the end (Prometheus being an other example).

A creature with a brain that size is almost certainly sentient, the chances of anything other than that being infinitesimal. Creatures have big brains in order to be intelligent, so without questioning how something with the bone structure of a great ape can even walk at that size, Kong _must_ be a genius. They have to be. It's an evolutionary fact, because even if they're uneducated in any formal fashion, their lifespan must dwarf ours, and in all that time I think it's safe to say that they've probably learned a few things. So, it follows that a creature of that intelligence and power could easily wipe out the human race. Not through brute strength, but through knowledge, knowledge used to create technological marvels that make our supercomputers look like stone wheels. So, again, it follows that they chose otherwise.

And remember that the characters who come face to face with Kong are on their knees and on the ground so I estimate that a human standing up is the height on Kongs face and comparitly a human standing up right next to a Godzillas head was completely tiny compared to his jaw.

If it was the older movies I could understand it as it was just kaiju action non stop with Godzilla being pitted against these other Titans & Godzilla always came out on top...
