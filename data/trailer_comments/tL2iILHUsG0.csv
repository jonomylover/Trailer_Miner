2014-06-15T05:39:48,"Well as an old guy, I guess I have to throw in my two cents and show how grumpy I am.  I'm a big fan of The Four Seasons and I've seen this trailer, along with another one that's more detailed and has interviews with Eastwood and others. That clip shows some scenes that this trailer doesn't show.  I see three problems so far, but I'm sure there will be others once the movie is released. 1) The Four Seasons never did choreography, folks. I'm sure they threw that in when the stage play started in order to make them appeal to younger people who would associate them with ""boy bands"". In the few clips that you see of the real Four Seasons when they weren't playing instruments, they were just standing close together maybe snapping their fingers. 2) They're singing ""Oh What A Night"" and from the looks of it, it's in their early days because they're wearing suits and bow ties. That song came out in 1975 when Frankie Valli had gotten an entire new group of ""Seasons"". Frankie had a resurgence in the mid-70's with Grease, My Eyes Adored You, and Swearin' to God and had some hits with these new guys. They had long hair by then, they didn't wear matching outfits, and NONE of the original Seasons were in the band. 3) The same goes with ""Who Loves You"". They show this one early on and it's the same thing.   So there's a question of accuracy here for me, folks. If it was a Beatles movie, you can bet your ass they'd have EVERY FACT STRAIGHT. Maybe this is just a misleading clip but from the looks of it, someone didn't do their homework, OR, they figure no one that's watching is going to give a damn. Well, us true Four Seasons fans do give a damn. ",0,0,oldschoolsinger,tL2iILHUsG0,0.1641774891774892,2014-06-15 05:39:48,False,True
