He led me through his garage, to get back, and there I made an amazing discovery... He had taken in every stray cat in our neighborhood, and half of them had kittens. There must have been 25 kittens in there! Within seconds, I sat down and been swarmed by their little meowing poof balls. Every color, kind, and age, down to little itty bitty kitties, just all over me wanting love.  It was one of the best moments of my childhood. But the best part, was getting to knock on his door every day, and go back to garage with my little brother to pet the kitties. He would bring over baskets of berries and homemade jams.

2019-07-25T22:21:43,"Looks like another addition to a great season of biopics. I would very much like Hollywood to do one  on Jared Fogle, the former Subway spokesperson and now convicted felon,  roly-poly-boy-toy and daily punching bag for any number of his fellow inmates at the federal penitentiary in Englewood, Colorado.   Perhaps it could be a musical.   One of the numbers could be called ""Smaller Pants,"" and two different versions could both open and close the production.  In the beginning, Jared sings ""I wanna get in smaller pants,"" in reference to his desire to lose weight by eating only veggie subs.  At the end prior to his arrest, as he's flying around the country molesting children, he could sing the same line, but it would of course have a far more sinister meaning.   Another number could involve a couple of parents going to the authorities to report that their pre-adolescent son has been victimized by Fogle.  The song could be titled ""He Went to Jared.""   You see, I'm a dead ringer for Fogle.   We're talking ""separated at birth"" identical.   Up until November, 2015 I had a fairly steady part time gig posing as him and entertaining at kids' birthday parties.  For a reasonable fee, I'd provide the entertainment (balloon animals and showing the kids the former pants with a 48 inch waistline that ""Jared"" used to have to wear before he started eating Subway veggies subs everyday) and the food (a Subway platter). Needless to say, my tax returns for the past few years have shown a fairly significant reduction in income. My last gig was just after Thanksgiving in 2015. The people who had booked me had paid a deposit in advance, so they went ahead and had me come out with my balloons and five foot cold cut with six toppings on  Italian herb bread.

She quietly took my hand and walked me over to the doorway of the family room. There I saw ten ""munchkins"", ages 2 to 7 years, absolutely enthralled and transfixed watching the TV. Each had their own bowl of melon fruit, and were eating without taking their eyes off of the TV. My wife had an after school day care she ran out of our house. Along with our two small boys at this time she on and off watch 6-8 neighborhood kids ages 5-8 years old.  I asked her what they were watching and she said this new show called ""Mr Rodgers Neighborhood"". I sat down at the dining room table to watch the show, my wife brought me a bowl of fruit, and we watched the show with the kids. Not one word was said. We just sat and enjoyed the show. What a great afternoon! Now my boys are grown men with families of their own and have moved out of state for better job opportunities and affordable houses, the neighborhood kids are grown and also moved away, and my wife pass 13 years ago.  Yet I've made new friends with the new neighbors and their kids. They're a more modern family, don't watch much TV, everything is the internet and their cell phones. I don't blame them though with all the crap on TV these days.

Hanks eyes reveal the hate, disdain and cold harshness typical of the soul of a modern Urban Progressive Lib elite. Can't hide that, no matter how much makeup is used. He is also has an abruptness in his attempt to duplicate Rogers speech mannerisms. I always thought that Rogers deserved a movie or documentary created in his honor, but they could have chosen an actor, even an unknown that would better fit the part. I really have to watch and fact-check this movie, because Hollywood always adds their own tilt to the point of a total warp of the truth.

But I can't deal with the insane hype machine for this relentlessly mediocre actor that's been going on for 30 years now. Every Tom Hanks movie becomes a celebration of Tom Hanks, not the subject matter or the people he plays. Even little things, like phoning it in on Fred Rogers' distinctive, world-famous, accent, and the fact (which I learned from the documentary) that Rogers was obsessive about keeping his weight at 143 lbs--a response to his childhood obesity, and a personal reminder of the words ""I (1) LOVE (4) YOU (3)."" Hanks is easily 80 pounds over that. Not a sin, but there are at least 100 great actors who could have done this role better, and the public's love of Mr. Rogers would have sold it without this guy who's more a self-important star-tripping Oscar-seeker than an actor.

Later on in my childhood I began to have the literally UNCANNY ability to spot people in our communities who were quite literally pedophile of the worst sort...though a pedophile of any sort is the worst sort if you ask me..... I‚Äôve always been one of those people who can spot ‚ÄúTHEM‚Äù even in my own family!  Looking back on that show I watching in early childhood I finally understood what I had been feeling...what those ALARM bells in my head actually meant!    In my experience there is NO ONE on the face of this earth who can ‚Äòact‚Äô as kindhearted, people caring, and a ‚Äòlover‚Äô of all individuals and NOT be a complete and total fraud!    Though I guess something in his past could have happened to give him some kind of bran damage....Or some kind of malformation of the brain at birth that can create a demeanor he seemed to have had..... There has to be a reason Tom Hanks is pulling from his character ‚ÄúForest Gump 1994‚Äù.

2019-08-16T01:10:23,"Tom Hanks is perfect to play Mr. Rogers. I would see such movie based on that. This trailer seems like the movie will focus on a sub character who I am guessing is Mr. Rogers's publicist/promoter. This character (who I am not sure if they are an existing person) seems like he is meant to be us, the viewer as a character in the movie and we are supposed to experience the greatness of Mr. Rogers's through him. This character will probably go through some struggle in life and Mr. Rogers will provide him the positive influence to carry through. This will be meant to help us face our own struggles in life. People will watch the movie though and say  ""who was that guy? I wanted see Mr. Rogers"". I hope I'm wrong though. Mr. Rogers was such an awesome guy and people should be able to experience that without any intervention.

It was a message from us to them: although they‚Äôre adults now, discussing business in a cutthroat world- they still need to be a neighbor to another, and allow another to be a neighbor to them. This went on for 20 years or so. One day in 2013 I sat at the bar while this song played, and nobody noticed it. It saddened me, because I know that in these times we needed Mr Rogers the most. In these times we all are in desperate need of a neighbor. The song no longer plays in our bars and lounges.

She had been suffering from Anxiety... Depression... BPD... OCD--most all of her life.  And I'd been BEGGING for her to get help, as... it was starting to take a toll on me... on us.  In January... she asked if I wanted to see it again.  I was OVERJOYED.  We went.  I cried again.  And spending time with this soulmate of mine--I have to tell you--she's been THE BEST THING IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.  But... when the Covid19 thing happened... she went into a dark, dark, deep, deep place.  And she pushed me so far away that... now... we're separated.  Probably ""over"".  100%.  She was also my BEST friend.  And I mean it... my BEST friend.  :( :( :(  And now... she doesn't want to talk to me... doesn't care about me.  Doesn't want to see me.  And now... I feel so abjectly empty.  Worthless (in some ways--although not regarding my work + influence on people's lives in the past).  I can't sleep.  I couldn't eat for a month.  I had to move 500+ miles away.  My life is in a shambles... and not even therapy is helping.  Maybe a little... but... I can't explain it:  I LOST MY SOULMATE TO THESE TERRIBLE DISEASES.  PLEASE seek help as early as you can if signs appear.  Please help FORCE others to seek help if they are avoiding it, preventing it, or worse... enabling others to just sweep the problems under the rug.  My ""life""... what I had... my DREAM... my happiness--these were all forfeit.  I now simply... ""exist"".  I pray that you NEVER have to endure what I am enduring right now.
