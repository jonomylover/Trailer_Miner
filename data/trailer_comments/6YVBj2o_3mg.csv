2016-12-08T18:05:58,"Warner Bros. Pictures My son, Mike, suggest that you and Frederator Films should do a new theatrical animated film right after Adventure Time The Movie call Sally And The Kung Fu Princesses Of Sheer Righteousness!.  It's about an Playboy-beautiful high school girl who got accidently chosen to be a part of the coolest princesses in the universe, The Kung Fu Princesses Of Sheer Righteousness, to stop an evil queen and her mighty army of titans from taking over both their adventurous kingdom world and Sally's world in one fell swoop!  The 2D animation needs to be beyond amazing, the cast and characters needs to be loveable, the music needs to be fantastic, the pacing needs to be great in the most brilliantly clever way possible and so much more. It'll also feel like you're back in the 1990's when seeing this animated film.  If this works out amazingly well, then you should make a flawlessly epic fun film franchise out of it and it'll be not only a total animated masterpiece and a cool experience to behold to date in Warner Bros. history at the same time, but also Lakewood Plaza Turbo levels of an absolute mega rad entertaining experience to behold to date in Warner Bros. history, period!!!
