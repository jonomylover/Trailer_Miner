That brings a lot more interesting concepts to the table than just, ""Jaegers vs Kaiju"" again. I also love how vibrant Uprising is compared to the first movie, and the CG still has time to be touched up, so I'm not worried, and no one else should really be either.

You have to remember that most of the battles in Pacific Rim 1 were fought in or completely submerged underwater. A few of the shots from this trailer look like similar movement speed comparable to Striker Eureka in the first movie, when he's taking down the Kaiju in the city (early on, I think).   As far as the movement speed of Saber Athena at 01:43, it kind of makes sense, given that it's supposed to be the fastest and most agile of the group (as per the wiki page, anyway). Still a little too fast though, I get that. I assume Bracer will have the slow, hulking movement speed that we all like.  Honestly though, I think it's a happy medium between Pacific Rim 1 and Transformers speed. Its almost certain that these Jagers will have had some upgrades since the first movie.

The spirit of Kaiju movies is men in rubber suits wrestling each other, and del Toro specified to the artists on the first film that the Jaeger and Kaiju designs should look like a man could wear them as a suit.  Additionally, the way the first film conveyed momentum was perhaps its shining achievement.  It helped suspend disbelief and paced fights out so that every hit landed with the impact of a freight train, after a few seconds of wind up, of course.  Again, there's not a lot to go off of yet, but I have reasons to be skeptical.  I hope it turns out great.",0,0,Hocotatium111,fUjicxMPDzs,0.060937500000000006,2017-10-07 01:56:34,True,True

The CGI doesn’t look too good and it’s looks like not much Jaeger deaths will be happing. The fights look less epic and awesome due to the lighting and the scenery and CGI.

Here they just move as if they are made entirely out of packing peanuts and not thousands of tons of metal just like they do in the new transformer movies.   Honestly stuff like that doesn't really bother me especially in a movie where the premise is about giants robots fighting aliens but when you see obvious signs like this that people aren't even caring enough to imitate the style the original was going for it really isn't a good sign for the movie to come.

2017-10-07T12:50:53,"Looks awesome so far, and I hope the finished product will be even better.  The Jaegers do seem a little bit fast in terms of movement, but from the first scene of the trailer where you can see a Jaeger-vs-Jaeger battle from the perspective of yellow-jacketed Amara (the 'Jaeger hacker' who is seen piloting 'Scrapper', a small Jaeger seen busting out of a barn later in the trailer), the Jaeger's foot movement seem very slow, reminding me of that one scene in Godzilla (2014) where you see Godzilla take a MASSIVE step from the perspective of people in an airport (or some other building) in Hawaii.  Jaegers on rockets seem very cool. I would like Saber Athena's (the red and orange Jeager) movements to be toned down a teensy bit.  Gipsy Avenger's design to me is very cool.  BTW, the Jaegers and Kaiju are DEFINITELY bigger than what you think, Gipsy Avenger will most likely be around 260 ft tall like its predecessor Gipsy Danger.  Titan Redeemer's drill seems a bit overkill which is fine. John Boyega will hopefully be a really good actor in this, since he was great in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  YES, Mako Mori is in the trailer (look closely, people) and anyways, she's confirmed to be in the film (there's literally going to be a character arc between her and Jake Pentecost).  Kaiju combining is VERY awesome, although I really hope the Kaiju in this film have the same charm, essence, uniqueness and fear factor that the first film had.  I mean, EVERYONE remembers Otachi right? (I hope y'all do).  Hopefully there will be more of them, and that there will still be a Kaiju Category system, it really makes you aware of how powerful these beasts are. Oh, and I hope they are given SICK names, since it gives them a lot of personality (remember in the first film, Raleigh tells his brother that they'll fight a Kaiju called 'Knifehead!' in such a way that you can tell that they love their job?) The first film's Jaegers had lots of moving parts and pistons. They will most likely keep this attention to detail the same in Uprising, and with 5 months till release time, I don't see why they don't give them the same feel the first one gave us. The CGI needs a bit of polishing and fine-tuning, but I'm hopeful. I REALLY want to see those awesome night-time and bad-weather fights that the first movie gave us. In the daytime, it really doesn't give us that pathetic fallacy. The song for the trailer is not 'hip rap stuff that only youngsters like', it's 2Pac's 'Untouchables' slowed down, and he's considered the best rapper EVER.  I am not defending the song choice though (I don't really like it, because the only rap songs I like are Chris Classic's 'I Am A Beast' (used in the Uprising teaser trailer) Eminem's 'Lose Yourself', SOLELY due to the Mom's Spaghetti meme. The new Jaeger designs are really cool in my opinion. So are the Kaiju designs. Hopefully Guillermo Del Toro, even as a producer, will influence the final product in such a way that it FEELS like the original Pacific Rim. I mean, back in 2013, I first watched that film and it became a TIMELESS classic to me, and is still my favourite movie up to now. I want Uprising to continue its legacy. I'm fine with change, just not so much that no one likes it. I am SORT OF worried about Steven S. DeKnight and FOUR OTHER producers, since they might have conflicting visions.  Please stop saying that the new Jaegers look like transformer rip-offs. They aren't.  Of course, they move faster than in the first film. But their movements will only be at the speed of say, Striker Eureka.  I have very high hopes since Pacific Rim is VERY nostalgic for me, I was only 9 when it came out and I got the first film on DVD for my 10th birthday.  I want Uprising to be on its level so I can rewatch it 13 times over without losing interest. I want it to be good since the first film USED TO BE my best friend's favourite film, but now it apparently sucks because of 'plotholes' that I cleared up entirely. Reply if you want to see those debunked.  Also, I  have watched Neon Genesis Evangelion and a few different Mobile Suit Gundam series, and NO! They are nothing like Pacific Rim. Reply if you disagree and I'll point out all the differences. Those who say that Godzilla could squash both these Jaegers and Kaiju, you're also very wrong. Seriously. I am DEFINITELY not against Godzilla though. I love that franchise.  So, that's my thoughts. Agree or disagree? I won't judge.

It doesn't have the same rainy, cloudy atmosphere that made the action sequences in the first one so epic, and the Jaegers are a little too swift and weightless and less mechanical than they should be. In that shot where Gipsy is fighting that enemy Jaeger in a city, there's no sense of scale and their lack of weight makes them feel human-sized. Also, I found it a little off-putting that the trailer barely focused on the kaiju themselves, but rather the Jaegers. Did they forget why the Jaegers were created in the first place??? And the kaiju they showed all seemed to be from the same set piece, which is kind of disheartening because I loved the variety of locations and Jaegers from the fight scenes in the original. Hopefully they haven't shown too much in this trailer because I really want to see some more variety in the fight sequences than just ""giant robot vs giant monster in generic city full of skyscrapers"".",1,0,Preston Bowe,fUjicxMPDzs,0.18680555555555556,2017-10-07 21:35:50,True,True

The darker, more serious tone of the first one seemed more realistic. That, and the fact that the situation looked realistic and felt like it could happen made it amazing. They ended on a positive note that should have been the end of the story.   But of course... Hollywood does not know how to let things die.  This one looks more for sole purpose of a cash grab while keying in on an epic story. This sequel was not asked for, although if it is good, it will be appreciated. This looks like your every day action film where the big guy saves the world and gets the girl. The first one was not so different from that narrative, but it actually brought some new stuff to the table from old and classic ideas. This is basically a parody. If it is good, I will be thankful.

In the original, they moved like giant robots. Even when they ran, they had a sense of weight to them. This made fights much more interesting and entertaining, since the pilots were controlling a heavy tank, while the Kaiju could easily maneuver around. Here, they pretty much look like giant, armored people, with very little sense of weight. For a comparison, the Megazord from the new Power Rangers movie had weight. And 2. The sense of scale. The original film was shot in such a way that it made the Jeagers feel giant, when compared to say a building or even the people. They felt large and dangerous to use. Here, there's none of that.

There was this single question floating around, Why are the jaegers fighting each other?  First of all they are not,  all the so called jaeger v jaeger combat is with a enemy unit revamped by the precursors, and then of course they would want to make the movie seem really thrilling so they would make some intresting cuts to throw us off just like  civil war or any dc/marval movie,   my prediction is that, after gypsy exploded, the precursors imediatlly returned to the blast site to collect the remains of the jaeger, and after that they realize this type of form for their terra formers would be a really essantial asset so they would make a mass produced type of the jeagers, like the ones ar 0:22 and 0:53 ,then at 1:36 is the master jaeger , or atleast a completly modified gypsy danger that would allow the precursors to have a better understanding about what their oppoonent is doing to thwart them, and eventually succeed in creating a superior model to the old gypsy danger which would classify as a mark 7 or 6, which of course is what humanity is constructing at that very moment, and thats why the jeagers are somewhat evenly matched ( The Gypsy avenger v super gypsy danger) Oh and  plus at the end where it shows a lieutenant class kaiju 1:56 as stated by the scientist in the last movie,   OH and im not actually loking forward for this movie, it seems to cartoony though im still gonna watch it and acutally find out if im gonna like it or not",0,0,MrReaver,fUjicxMPDzs,0.24630325814536339,2017-10-09 05:19:04,True,True

It has really cheesy jaegers unlike the old ones which were more junky, which is what I really liked about the old one, not this cheesy new super advanced machines which just look straight out of the future. Like I see what they did with the new Gipsy Danger having a blade on its right arm like Gypsy danger had the sword, but I honestly prefer the less scifi more realistic jaegers.

It was a healthy mix but this seems way left field, it is definitely the direct successor to the original but it has become ""colourful"" with the maze runner, hunger games, new power rangers, divergent type focus on ""young adults who must save the world, only they can"".... at least thats the feel it gives off these early stages. It now has that transformers and power rangers feel to it and thats not a good thing imo but we will see. these are initial thoughts anyways.   I lov John Boyega but if this movie is campy, even his young charisma wont save a typical young kids are the only ones who can save the world with giant robots type cliche storyline.

2017-10-16T06:36:56,Y'know I'm positive the trailer sped up a lot of shots from the movie. The shot with the three kaiju at 1:30 or 1:21 really seemed sped up. 1:40 and 1:45 (watch the Jaeger's leg) seem a bit closer to the first PR. And I mean Pacific Rim had to cheat a few times. Remember Gipsy jogging when she went looking for Otachi? Yeah pretty heavy but I think the Jaegers and Kaiju still moved at lightspeed for their sizes in general. I'm more concerned with final product entertainment instead of how the Jaegers look or how fast they move. Okay granted I do like the look of the Jaegers more from the first movie. But they are not deal breakers for sure.,0,0,Irrelevant402,fUjicxMPDzs,0.1809848484848485,2017-10-16 06:36:56,True,True

I think it sucks to see people rationalize the negative comments as being inconsequential because it's a ""Dumb big robot movie, and it doesn't need to be anything more"". I think thematically the first Pacific Rim was interesting in both its narrative as well as its distinctive art style. The acting was well done, and you felt like the world was brought to life through the efforts of Del Toro. Even through small details like the labored movements of the Jaegers which gave a sense of scale as to how large they are, and the properties of physics that would not allow them to move as quickly as they are in the above trailer. Just throwing in my two cents as an avid fan, I hope I'm wrong and this film is just as good as the first.",12,1,Nathan Mabie,fUjicxMPDzs,0.11434837092731828,2017-10-16 20:55:08,True,True

2017-11-24T11:17:48,"The thing I want is a movie or series about Cherno Alpha. Also, what moron gave a robot a spiky rocket fist? Have they done no research about the Pacific Rim lore at all?  Also, is that girl a teenager or just a short woman? Cause from the look of it, most of those candidates appear to be kids... which is extremely stupid as during the initiation of the neural link you need to have pretty strong hold over your emotions. Teens are also emotional and likely to lose their head.   If the candidates were 25+ I would not have any issues with this, but from what I could see they were not. Sure, if *all* the older pilots had been killed this could be understandable, but generally, you *don't* put a 15 year old kid at the front in a warzone. Especially if that kid is supposedly a genius that might have created the only *single pilot neural link* in the whole world.   You would keep her out of danger and make her try to recreate it as this would mean that the restriction of candidates would disappear and you would be able to recruit many more thousands of people able to pilot their own jaegers...   I was initially excited for this movie, but after I calmed down and truly *saw* the trailer for what it was, I kind of lost faith in this movie. They are pulling off way too many unbelievable things (even for Pacific Rim) that I honestly do feel a bit let down. The having ""young cadets"" rather than the old crew is pretty much to try to appeal to younger audience in the US whilst the rest of the world enjoyed the older crew of the first movie just fine.  They did this for financial gain, not because they story would be more interesting that way. And after the hundreds of ""teen saves the world"" movies we have been getting the past decade I am personally sick and tired of that trope. : /",0,0,Elmithian,fUjicxMPDzs,0.10104272205336036,2017-11-24 11:17:48,True,True

2018-11-09T23:27:00,Please release a 3 movie in likeness of the first these movies made me happy cause I grew up on power rangers voltron and Godzilla and other Japanese monster movies.  When the first one released I was amazed at the time and development put in to it i was in abosolute awww during the fight scenes.  The second was great also but del toro put a passion in it that didn’t get recognized like it should in the night fight scenes dirt and water flying in the air was real amazing.  Charlie would half to return didn’t understand why mako had to pass in the second but she needs to return as well.  Make the 2nd like a prequel to the series like fast and furious franchise.  It would be nice to see it mix with Godzilla that would just blow minds. More people know Godzilla than big robot in my option.  Like we’re they fight but Godzilla and ppdc half to team up maraculously to defend the earth.  Like the fight movie we’re theirs 3 people fighting but 2 know they half to fight together to survive ummm the predator vs alien movie a situation like that.  Plus if kyju were pregnant at least one or two babies could have been born secretly just in hiding like the new Godzilla movie laying dormant and in detected for years which could be Godzilla but please release a third movie I beg you,0,0,corey whitson,fUjicxMPDzs,0.14977904040404041,2018-11-09 23:27:00,False,False
