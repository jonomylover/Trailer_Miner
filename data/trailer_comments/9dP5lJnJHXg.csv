2015-05-01T08:48:32,"St. Vincent, a good but unfinished film. Don’t get me wrong I’m 80% positive about this film but now and then there were these strange moments where the story seemed to be going somewhere but then abruptly fell off a cliff. St. Vincent, is one of those good bad role model films. Or bad good role model films if you know what I mean? So anyway Vincent, is the good/bad role model of a little boy who without going into too much detail Vincent, ends up stealing a very substantial sum of money from. This is the first of those plot points that just falls off a cliff. At the time it really seems a big deal. Vincent, is very clearly torn up about it and it really feels like a betrayal that is going to completely tear apart their friendship. However here’s the kicker. I don’t think the kid ever finds out about it. Once it happens that’s it. It happens and then everything just moves on. It might as well of never happened. If you remove that seen from the movie I don’t think it would make any difference whatsoever. Seriously watch the film its weird. This is what I mean by unfinished. I really get the impression that they were going somewhere with it but then ran out of time or changed their minds in the middle of production. The way they dealt with this plot point is sincerely one of the strangest things I’ve ever seen in a film.  Very surprisingly this film averts a certain cliché and I’m not sure if I should be happy or unhappy about that. See I love it when people subvert clichés. However I’m not sure if it was the result of genius or lazy writing. Traditionally in films such as this the character who you could refer to as the Screwup, or Walking Disaster, spends most of the film living up to their name until they inevitably go too far and have a falling out with everyone. The Screw Up/Walking Disaster, then acknowledges that they have gone too far and that they need to fix everything which they then proceed to do very competently. The first Mr Bean, film is a perfect example of this. However after Vincent’s inevitable fallout moment as a result of him being a screw up/walking disaster he simply shows no remorse and rudely insults the mother of the kid who he was hanging out with. The kid then proceeds to do a speech about how Vincent, is awesome. Anyway I’m not exactly complaining about this. I’m just mostly acknowledging how surprising it was that the film didn’t end with Vincent, getting off his ass and saving the day somehow. Instead everyone simply forgives him for being a remorseless, and I do repeat remorseless, insensitive dick.",1,0,Elephants Are Cool,9dP5lJnJHXg,0.12071450216450218,2015-05-01 08:48:32,False,False
