To only just now be getting any kind of information/imagery from the studio does not inspire a whole lot of confidence. There's also the trepidation stemming from the fact that they rushed this film through to get it made before the license expired. And like everyone else, I have issues with the casting, though I'm not focused entirely on Michael B. Jordan's questionable addition. (My main concern in that regard is the effect it'll have on the story. If they wanted more racial diversity, there are plenty of black actresses they could have hired along side Jordan that would be great as Sue, but they had to hire a white actress, and the possible storylines that will cause that are floating through my head make me want to gag.) My biggest casting beef is Jamie Bell. He's a great actor who excels at playing nuanced characters, and they cast him as Ben Grimm? So he'll either be layered under so much prosthetics that you can't tell it's him, or (best case scenario) it's a mo-cap role where there will be elements lost in translation. IMHO, he's much better suited to play Reed, and have Miles Teller play Ben. [\rant]",0,0,Morgan Ring,e-BVs-KCSiA,0.25625000000000003,2015-01-27 16:06:00,True,True

It did not inform, entertain or get us excited. It might as well not even exist. If the effects are not ready then wait until they are.  This movie has an uphill battle from the start. The previous 2 were average at the very best, we have heard bad things about the story and the Fantastic Four are not really the most exciting characters to people right now. Plus it's not a Marvel movie, its a FOX movie so immediately people don't view it the same way. At least Ant-Man showed us the character and a couple of cool scene which since Marvel are showing off a new character thats all they needed to do. And after you just say we trust Marvel to do it right. FOX does not have that.  You had one chance to make a good first impression, you have a good cast and good characters, show them. You didn't.

2015-01-27T18:12:58,"There are two issues here, and neither can be said to be of racist nature without proper justification.  The first one is the fact that Johnny was made to be black while his biological sister Sue was made to be white; there is an obvious problem here, they should of either made them both black or both white. The problem is not that Johnny is being portrayed by a black actor, the problem is in the hole this has created in the story, unless they suddenly change the background story and say that they are in fact half siblings, which creates further holes within the history stories, which may lead to more fabricated changes to cover that hole, and then more to cover those newly created ones, and so on. Basically all in all it was an unnecessary change, seemingly for no apparent reason.  The other issue is that of keeping true to the comics, many fans follow the comics, some of which are quite old and to suddenly have the race of a central character changed for no practical reason doesn't make sense. This is less of a valid arguement, because a lot of things do get changed from comics when made into movie adaptations but none the less it is still a valid arguement, especially if the change is not justified.  It seems the change was more to do with the casting preferences, rather than to create a different story i.e. they did not make the change in order to create a change in the story but it was a change due their liking of Micheal B. Jordan over others for whatever reason - be it to appeal more to the black community or be it because he showcased himself to be a good Johnny.

2015-01-27T18:25:55,"Looks awesome! As far as I'm concerned the FF was boring and kinda lame! Marvel is probably cancelling the comic because no one reads it. The FF needed not just a reboot but a complete overhaul. I think this movie will deliver on that AND make the FF relevant again. Thing actually looks like rock and not a human callus, Kate Mara can act circles around Jessica Alba. I believe the suits we see in the teaser are early/rough prototypes created by reed much like iron-man's mark 1 suit he built in the cave. By then end of the movie or the sequel we will see much more stream-lined uniforms.

No emphasis was ever placed on Johnny Storm's race. Him being white had nothing to do with the over all story line. At least not to my knowledge. Now, I would totally be against the idea of a white actor playing someone like Sam Wilson (Falcon). Mainly because Falcon being African-American was a plot point for the character. It wouldn't make sense to have a black actor play Steve Rogers (Captain America) either. He was a superhero during WW2. The US chose him to be the face of America. During those times, they wouldn't have chosen a black male to be the face of America.   Also, Johnny Storm being played by a black actor doesn't mean that we're going yo get a street wise, hip hop loving version of the character. It could be the same Johnny from the comics. And yes, it is still possible for Johnny and Sue Storm to be siblings.

2015-01-27T19:12:00,"Well I'm starting to get the exact same feeling from the Amazing Spiderman movies...and that's not a good thing. It's a reboot fine, but what kind of difference am I seeing here? They get their powers through a machine instead of space? And their suits are not black instead of the classic blue? The big issue I suppose is the special effects. Seeing Johnny Storm played by a african american is not issue to me (adoption I heard in story) even Chris Evans praises him to play the role, the fire effect might be just the same. The Thing on the other hand sounds like a good direction from body suit to motion capture much like the Hulk. And the FF symbol is slightly changed from circle to square. I don't know if it's going to be good or bad, the reviews will say that as well as the viewer. The vibe I'm getting here is like copying Nolan's Intersteller and that movie made me dry my tear ducts out. Luckily got some laughs later on after watching Dumb and Dumberer at the same day, I have weird taste in movies, sue me.

2015-01-27T19:55:50,"As much as I love the fantastic four comics I don't think I will be seeing this in theaters. While Fox turned around the X-men  franchise into something really entertaining (and introducing some issues that conflicted with the story canon), I'm not sure that the current cast has the acting chops for this. Yes there has been a lot of issues revolving around the age of the cast and the fact that the human torch is black. I can agree with those people on many things, but for different reasons. Changing the ages and even johnny's race is more a ploy to bring in different demographics and NOT to enhance the story. If there were valid reasons and it went with the canon of the story Mr. Fantastic could be Ms. Fantastic for all that it matters. It's about marketing and causing a stir so that it stays at the fore front of everyone's mind.   There is a difference, as well, between a character and the mantle (costume, title etc...) that a character wears. Batman is a mantle, that can be given out. The same goes for the green lantern and even Thor, because both of those characters are the bearer of something that gives them their current identity. It suits these characters because if you are just enough to lift the hammer, wield the ring or don the cape and cowl then the gender/race/age doesn't matter.   It would be like having a Latin Storm or a female version of professor X. Those characters aren't based on a mantle, and their very origins are dependent on where they are from and how they have become who they are. How they are perceived and treated is based their identities. Yes you can arbitrary change them, but why not just make a new character to suit your (and your audiences) needs.   Now if you wanted to reboot the whole franchise and do things differently while claiming that it's a homage to the comic but is going in a different route... fine. Truly, that is fine and could be a good way to go. Fox is banking on the increase of other demographics so that if they lose portions of their core (people who really like the comics) it would still be a net gain. But it then comes down to this: Now it's just another sci fi movie with vague connections to its original source material.  And that's why I'm waiting for it to come out on video. I'm not interested in supporting this when really the rights should be given back to Marvel so they weave it back into the current cinematic universe.

Now you are destroying the FF yet again. I don't care about the Storms, (many want to make race an issue and while it is eyebrow-raising worthy, it is no big deal, really), at all, this reboot is simply a rehash of Chronicle more-so than a Fantastic Four movie.

Ok, we get it, you're taking a new approach and everything has to be handled delicately, but that doesn't mean you can't make it a bit more visually exciting, and at least stick to what makes fans happy. (by that I mean keep the plotlines short and simple, and make sure we see a lot of use of special effects) Because at the end of the day, it is the Fantastic 4, an iconic group of characters we look forward to seeing on the big screen. The last films were too far on the ""cheesy and obvious"" scale, and this one looks to be on the other end of the spectrum. I can't really judge since I haven't even seen it yet.

In the world today compared to the 30-40 years ago when these comics were written they made most of the characters white and with good reason it was just how the US was. You wouldn't have a black guy just hanging around a few white people. I'm pretty sure if they were written today that the characters would be more diverse in race especially when it comes to groups. So if you are making a movie today based on a past comic but making it modern day then yes something's will change in particular ethnicity.

I honestly was expecting this to be a continuation of the previous F4 movies but to my surprise and displeasure the whole thing is being revamped.  To my surprise, people have a bigger problem with Johnny's ethnic change.  Here's the thing though, I see why people would be mad with the fact with the changing of the ethnicity of one the characters, not in any kind of racial way, but they are pretty much changing the whole identity of Johnny's character since he and Sue are blood related siblings. I have no problem with him being black but I do have a problem with them not being blood related. I would feel the same if he was still a white character but not Sue's brother.

I don't mind Michael B Jordan as Torch. The only thing is that I would like a quick bit of exposition explaining the precise relationship between him and Sue. But it also has to feel natural and not forced into the movie. And they can't just gloss over it, because there are different levels of ""brother/sister"" relationships, and I want it to be as close to a real brother and sister as possible.  So, if they are step-siblings, then their parents need to have been married since they were little, and not just 4 years ago or something. Johnny and Sue need to have a history as little children together.

No problem there, either. This just feels different. Johnny and Sue are supposed to be full blood brother and sister, yet Sue's white. It feels like they're forcing diversity and putting everyone who objects to it into a corner where they're automatically labelled a racist. I get that the majority of superheros were created in the '60s or earlier by white men, and they decided to make just about every superhero white. But just stick to the source material for FF and stop trying to look so enlightened. I notice that the only time they change comic book character's ethnicity in film adaptations is when the original character is white, usually making them black. If this was done the other way around, like making Falcon a white guy in the last Captain America movie, I wonder what reactions that would get in comparison.

And that movie also dealt with the concept of superpowers and it did a pretty good job! Trank hasn't made another movie since, but it was announced quite a while back that he would be directing a Fantastic Four reboot, the fact that he has seemingly taken his time along with the rest of the film-crew, and the fact that his first movie was pretty exciting and cool, makes me personally have relatively high hopes for this movie.  Plus, Michael B.Jordan was pretty good and very witty in his role in Chronicle, so just cram it haters.

2015-01-27T23:13:45,"It seems to be a common theme in movies, ""black men are ugly"".... and to some degree, it is true.  Who would disagree with the following statement :  Women are beautiful, men are ugly? Some have noticed that Hollywood seems to  celebrate males who look more ""femme"" than ""mensch"".  Hence, most leading men, are clean-shaven, boyish in appearance.  The message is, ""Do not be a  manny"".  Behold, the enemy - the enemy is patriarchy. And that, is not a bad thing, is it?  Especially with regards to  the pagans, the gentiles, the ungodly, etc.  ... Boys who  seek wisdom, naturally look towards father-figures.... But the world says, Forget such questions, learn a trade rather, young apprentice, and seek employment - to serve others... The First Man was created from the dust of the ground, at a time when the earth was well-watered everywhere.  So, was he not ""black""?  And the First Woman was created from a rib taken from him - hence, was she not ""white""?... And so, when neo-nazis claim that the history of the world is one of 'the black man violating the purity of the white woman' - that seems .... somewhat accurate.  Although, when two are in love, call it marriage, and not  violation, when two become one flesh.... Have not women always used men, for carnal purposes?  - to obtain better accomodations by, etc.?  Has not society always favored daughters over sons, to the degree that the boy who looks ""femme"" is held in higher esteem than the males who look  Esau-hairy-hunter like? ... Here, The Thing, begins as a ""black  guy"" and ends up, as a ""dusty-load of bricks"".  Bricks, from clay, dust, water? Baked in an oven? ... Men, are like trees.  Jesus said that they who hear Moses would hear him.  And so, conversely, they who hear Jesus, also hear Moses. There is an expression found in the Old Testament :  ""Drawers of water, hewers of wood"".... To many, this means, slavery is OK.  But to they who hear ... men are like trees.  What will you do, take care of your own children, or mind the strangers' who are not accustomed to the ways of holiness, life, etc.?  And will they not become as stumbling blocks unto you, O'Israel, causing you to be ""hewn down""?  Jesus said that every tree that does not bare good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire.... Behaviour matters, and not appearance.  Some are male, and others are female.  The masculine covers the feminine.  Some seem to look as if they have no outer-covering, as if they have been barked (outer wood removed).... The Thing, is an interesting character. Ben Grimm learns the importance of how appearance, and usefulness, matters not as  much as who you truly are, inside, when those other things are set aside - at least, that is how he was portrayed in the comic books.... Ugly, but now, more useful, he longs for...?? Peace.  Love.  Other good things?  Grimm... an attitude, towards life, really.",1,0,rowdy yeats,e-BVs-KCSiA,0.1560657596371882,2015-01-27 23:13:45,True,True

The people that pay to see these movies are Black, White, Spanish, Asian, Native American, Columbian, Indian, Arabic, Palestinian & so much more! This is no longer the era of just White films or just Black films. Diversity is #Here! As a country we are diverse in our education, politics, music, food & cloths. Its only logical to reflect it in the movies & TV shows we watch. It took this country #decades to become open to the idea of  diversity, to be open to sit next to someone of a different race or religion.  Those classic films & TV shows were wonderful not because the cast was white but because of the actors & actresses in them. And the reason why #most of those films had an all white cast when they were created is because they were still in the time of segregation. And even after segregation was put to an end the mentality of the old generation was still there. So when people of ethnic back ground entered the film industry they were given the roles of servitude, savage or an idiot w/ a heart of gold. The failer or success of the film should #not be determined by the individual's race but by the individual's talent as an actor/actress & by the script given .

I will not complain about anything, but if Fox doesn't get any of their personalities/characters right. I will be done with fox.

He was made white because no one thought to make him any other race. Storm, Black Panther, Falcon, Black Lightning, Steel, etc. etc. Their blackness is integral to their characters. They were made black for a specific reason, that reason being to add representation in a white dominated world. People were outraged about the White erasure in Exodus because it erased parts of the inherent culture and identity of the Egyptians, and Hebrews. Johnny storm being black hurts no one, but making storm white erases part of something incredibly important (being a literal african goddess and immigrant from a small tribe and the few black characters in X-Men) and takes away from the representation and relations that a kid would have because a black/african kid yet again sees not enough heroes like him/her. ",0,0,Xavier goodwin,e-BVs-KCSiA,-0.12149122807017546,2015-01-27 23:55:35,True,True

How can people say this movie is ""terrible"" or ""garbage"" if they only saw a teaser trailer that's less than two minutes. 3. PEOPLE...this movie is an adaptation, which means there might be changes to the source material. Marvel Studios also made a huge change for Ultron and his origins, but I'm guessing you're still going to see that movie. 4. As people have said before me, Johnny Storm being white IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE CHARACTER. 5. Before you get on me by saying they didn't need to make Johnny black and the studio did it just because, you should know that the actor, Michael B. Jordan, worked with director Josh Trank on a movie called ""Chronicle,"" so maybe they're collaborating again because Trank likes working with Jordan. 6. My final point is why are we losing faith in this movie? Is it because of rumors that we don't know are true? Leaked pictures with the visual effects not fully done? No advertising for the movie before this teaser trailer? Look at the talent in front of and behind of the camera. You have five great actors: Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell, Michael B. Jordan, and Toby Kebbell. Josh Trank who directed ""Chronicle,"" a good movie imo, who looks like is making a good movie at least and is going to have a bright future.

When I read the comments, people are complaining about a lot of things about this movie but the one I see the most is about Johnny Storm.  All of you are mostly complaining about a fictional superhero character from a fictional comic book to be in a fictional movie who is cast as an African-American character like crying babies.  I bet you guys are the same ones that believe that the nationality of Santa Claus, another fictional character, is Caucasian, haha.  Ok, let's say this, what if Michael B. Jordan acts just like Johnny Storm from the comics, then what? You would've cried, screamed, and yelled from this trailer for no reason because he done your favorite character justice, right? Or maybe you will still be upset and say ""I don't like him because he's black!!!""

Century Fox got this one wrong even if this becomes a hit, which i doubt but dont mind being proven wrong as i support bold moves even if somewhat illogical.  I just think this one is nonsensical, no need to go there! But if you felt like it than Ben coul've been the one to change, not Johnny Storm. Dont go and break a formula that works as a solid brand just because the previous movies werent great.  That being said,  To all the ones, who give reverse examples such as black panther, storm, baracus of A-team, its a bit scary if you're not able to see the difference. The first thing one need to understand is we're now in a somewhat era where minorities fight to get more leading roles, white people people never had that struggle to fight to get a role over a minority, so turn a black role into a white role and it surely wont make sense, make baracus white and now you have an all white team, i wouldnt blame people claiming that was a racist move. So from the get go its nonsensical to compare this as a 50/50 issue, Take any known black icon, shaft or the ones mentioned above and it wont make sense.

2015-01-28T01:33:25,"I honestly have a problem with the Fantastic Four having a different race than he is written in the comics. Before you call me racist, or ignorant. I'm actually a very progressive thinker that wouldn't have a problem with this if they have a good backstory as to what's going on in the plot. The original Johnny Storm is white and I think for a movie to do a bit of fan service, it should be casted that way, but on the brighter side of things that I'm really hoping for:  For all we know, this could be in the far future where a new Fantastic Four comes together out of sheer luck. This could also be a bigger opportunity to do a reboot right by not dwelling on how the first two films set up an expectation.

Of course you have a few special cases like miles morales but overall new characters doesn't sell.   So you have this mostly white medium that doesn't allow minorities to succeed and you're trying to bring it to the general audience where diversity is not only important, it's often expected, so they do what they can do, change white characters to black.

2015-01-28T04:12:18,"Wow seeing a lot of racist comments....  You guys do realize that the guy that directed Chronicle is directing this right? He was also involved in the writing, so logically if a director trusts a young actor, like Michael B Jordan, he's going to find a spot for him in this film. He probably was eyeing Miles Teller too and I don't see him being Johnny Storm. With that being said, your not going to put a very charismatic actor as the thing, so they put him as Johnny. Kate Mara was probably the right fit for their version of Sue Storm and again great young actress. It is much simpler to just write in an adoption story than find the perfect black Sue Storm or the perfect white Johnny Storm. Plus they would have to look similar enough to both these young people to make a believable brother and sister pair.  Comics should be the basis to any superhero movie but you also have to have the freedom to tell your own unique version. I like to point to V for Vendetta which had it's basis in the comic but steered away from a carbon copy. Both are incredible for their respective medium, however one deals with straight facism and the other is more about the neo-conservative movement. Neither one could have done it better in the other form. Then take for example Watchmen which stayed away from any major change (aside from the ending) but was vastly superior in the comic format.  I don't know if a young cast for the F4 is going to turn out all that great, fingers crossed though.

2015-01-28T05:05:26,"I think the important thing to remember about comics is that each re-imagining of the genre is considered part of a multi-verse to explain inconsistencies. Johnny Storm as a Marvel character is the WHITEST character ever. He has blue eyes, blond hair and light complexion. That is not a racist comment. That is a fact. Stan Lee created four very VERY white characters. If a movie company chooses to hire a black actor to play the role, then they have to make allowances for that character to have the checklist of characteristics, such as, brother of Sue Storm, part of Fantastic 4, pilot, arrogant personality, then they have to add in that he was adopted by a white family, or that Sue was adopted by a black family, or that interracial single parents got married and did a cross adoption. Whatever.  I only get aggravated when they make these kinds of ethnic shifts when they cannot find a strong character of the ethnicity they seek, so they take an already popular character and mix them up calling it creative license, and then react like they are being attacked by race haters when anyone complains. No one has had the balls to change Superman or Batman into a Chinese guy or an Hispanic dude. Why not Wonderwoman played by a man?  I think that there is room for play. If you can convince me that the shift is justified, I'll buy it. Nick Fury is SO much better played by Samuel L Jackson than David Hasselhof! When Green Lantern was marketed as black it was a big hell no, but they wrote it so that there could be more than one Green Lantern. That was ok. But if it this just to please some affirmative action group, satisfy some personal feeling of racial guilt, or because you have some nepotism-style connection to the actor, then that is a problem for me.  I make the argument in the same sense as an actor playing Abraham Lincoln. He is an historical figure in history whose racial importance is in his white lineage. He was the son of a farmer, poor as dirt, self-taught, and at some point in his life saw men being bought and sold by other men and asked how there could be such a travesty of justice. He almost sank into political obscurity but for a sudden shift of heart, and he became the first white man with such power to do the right thing and declare all men equal even though as a prosperous and charismatic white man he was spelling out his own doom.  If you got James Earl Jones to play Abraham Lincoln, not only would he look silly in the role, but it would miss the point of a lot of who and what Lincoln was and for what he stood.  If you look at every comic, game, movie, tv show, or piece of merchandise in which Johnny Storm has ever appeared there is NO DOUBT he is a white character, from beginning to end. Every awkward moment with Sue, every place he's ever gone, everything he's ever done as a character has at least some reflection of his racial upbringing. He's rich, successful, a lady's man, arrogant, and then made powerful by cosmic energy. Yes, he is also heroic in the classic sense, but he reacts to the world and the world to him, as though he is a caucasian male in his prime.  ""Giving"" the character to the black community, if that is indeed what is happening, is NOT a nod to equality, not a reparation, not even something to brag about. It is like saying, ""You don't NEED a strong, successful, engaging black superhero. We'll just give you our leftovers."" As an African American, is that really what you want, for things just to be changed as an afterthought to placate you? Hell no, it isn't. You should not stand for that. Where is the black superhero who can take a full on punch from Superman, laugh in his face, and then go rescue people from a burning building. We need more Falcons (minus the pinkish suite), more Black Panthers, and more Powermen (a.k.a Luke Cage). Stop changing popular WHITE heroes into BLACK heroes, and START featuring more black characters who STAND on their OWN.",1,0,A. T. Miller,e-BVs-KCSiA,0.1377827380952381,2015-01-28 05:05:26,True,True

I think (I couldn't tell where she was in the video, to be honest, but I only saw one black person, so I'm guessing she's going to be white or another race), so does that mean that Johnny isn't going to be her little brother in the movie?

We have the Fantistic Four movie, from 2005, its sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer 2007.  Now, the series is being rebooted, only a decade later, with this movie.

2015-01-28T05:50:26,"You know, this looks like it *may* be one of the better Marvel movies to come down the pike in a while.  My opinion is the FF needs a makeover, to make them more contemporary.  The original origin story is dated, and silly in the context of the present day.  I loved the FF as a kid, but never followed after I was in my teens, because it always seemed like a kids comic. (er, more so than other comics, I mean)   I *think* this rendition may correct that, but we will see.   The biggest flaw I see is von Doom.  I *wish* they hadn't rushed to introduce him, and saved him for a later movie.   IMO, the Mad Thinker would have been perfect for this one ---  a classic FF villain, and one I could easily see as the hacker they are supposedly rendering Doom as.    A crappy version of Doom will almost tank the movie *and* the franchise by itself.    Hopefully it won't be the case.   As for Johnny, really, his race is a moot issue to me.  A person's character and personality have nothing to do with their coloring.  All I'm concerned about is that they get the character right.   For everyone who's tweaked that he won't be white, blue eyed and blond, get a life.    And understand I say that *as* a blue eyed white person.   ",0,0,Brian Shaffner,e-BVs-KCSiA,0.1460576259489303,2015-01-28 05:50:26,True,True

That being said, the human torch should not be made black because he is supposed to be the invisible woman's brother. Even if it is explained that he is adopted or whatever they decide to do, that would change the relationship that he would have with his sister, which is changing an integral part of the character for the sake of throwing a black character into the movie.

You mess up white people’s heroes in Hollywood, you’ll never work in this town again!”  For those that say this is progression... it's not in the comic books.  Yes, the Falcon becomes Captain America.. that is part of the storyline now.  But can you imagine a movie about Blade, and letting Jackie Chan play the role because they needed martial arts?  How about sticking to the source material.  Note : For those that say Nick Fury is white in comic, and he's played by Samuel L. Jackson.. please go pick up a few comic book or read Wiki for reference on this matter.  Stop sounding like an idiot wannabe comic fan.",0,0,Cho Shinoya,e-BVs-KCSiA,0.0018939393939393873,2015-01-28 08:01:10,True,True

2015-01-28T10:03:33,"The raca problem in movies got so turned upside down, it's hard to comprehend. Racial equality, which is probably our goal as humanity, means, that race as a factor in policy should not matter, so influence of person's race could be taken out of the equasion, without changing anything. However the police of ""every movie should have a black actor"" is extremely overblown, to the point when, there is a Robin Hood movie with black  King Richard Lionheart. However, people get extremely sour of you touch this matter, accusing everyone of racism. But isn't it racist to have black actor in the movie, just for the sake of having a black actor? Not because if plot or source material reasons, but because of race. Black human-torch is extremely weird to me, because human-torch is supposed to be a brother to the Invisible Woman, who is another Hollywood blond with model haircut in the middle of the apocalypse. One of them might be adopted, byt that's or whatever, but that's just another change from the source. Nobody complained about black Nick Fury, because surprise: Ultimate universe, remember? Yeah, that was kickass. They clearly changed a lot, which raises the question - why keep it Fantastic Four? If you have a script, written by people, few of whom were told to go free and don't even read source, why keep it source trend? Make it a new franchise with new characters, not bound by old and kinda silly comics. Instead you make something like this, covering with creative freedom thing that were probably thrown in to create a bit of drama and get attention to the movie. Also if you want to go ham on the whole ""HERMAGERD RACISM!"" thing, think about this. They made human-torch black, because he burns a lot. Boom. If he was invisible, that because black absorbs light and he cannot be seen. Boom. If he was the Thing, that's because he's buff and weird. Boom. If he was stretching, that's because...

2015-01-28T10:27:16,"I think that personally, to not obscure what could be a great movie with the trite and tired race arguments that were destined to come of this, the movie studio should have chosen a different  character to revamp. Grimm, or perhaps Dr. Richards even. That sort of change really would require less back pedaling in story. However, what the genre really lacks are effective lead roles for black actors. For many years in the Marvel Universe, Storm was the only dominant black character to be found. Comic books were founded in different days. They were also censored heavily by a group of old, stuck church ladies. A 50s mentality dominated because of that.   A great, strong character to bring out from the old days, one of the Marvel Knights, would be the Black Panther. Great Story. Perhaps a movie for the Suicide Squad. Cyborg and the crew were great characters. Those, along with Shockwave, already exist. To fit them into story would also be great.  Hancock was really too farcical to count as a super hero. Too modern, and lacking in history, it was a good attempt to diversify the genre though.   I would like for hero stories to have mass appeal, because the kid in all of us needs a hero. I don't like to see so much anger from fans being divided.   The classic titles do need more diversification, as well there needs to be stronger leads to give that power. Changing the race of a relatively minor character actually doesn't go far enough. Changing Dr. Richards, now that would be something. Or Iron Man, maybe Captain America, Spidey...    Nick Fury was originally not brown. Samuel Jackson is, of course, doing a great job. However, that change only required a change in color. No real change in story.   No one can win this argument, and I think it was a mistake for the studio to create this bitter, hostile argument by inserting  diversity in a clumsy way. At the same time, if the studio really wanted to be proactive in offering diversity to the genre, there should be a strong, black leadership part. Even if it is Dr. DOOM.

And, that was really because of Johnny and Sue being biological siblings.    After reading through a number of comments,  though, I realized something.  I was okay with movie studios restructuring the race of certain characters.  But, for some reason, restructuring their familial relationships is taboo?    I like the idea of the Storms being biological siblings.  But, that's because when I was growing up, there was a different connotation associated with being related by blood vs adoption or step- siblings.  Now, I'd say that the prevailing culture in America is different.  And, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  So, if the movie studio now wants them to be adopted, or not even siblings for that matter, I'm not going to stand in their way.

2015-01-28T15:01:19,"Lemme share my personal opinion on this trailer. I liked the tone of this. It really stands out more to a very realistic theme, a little background story to each of the characters. Yet, I notice some negative feedback on it. I, too, disagree that the Human Torch should be African-American. But ragging about it considers me as a racist. But the truth is, he and Invisible Woman are siblings, unless one of them is adopted, according to this movie. Of course, the Fantastic Four look extremely young in this trailer, another contrast to the comic books. I'm also surprised that this'll hit the theaters around the time the original 2005 Fantastic Four came out just 10 years ago. Sure, there is lazy CGI & a poor acting choice for the Invisible Woman. But let's a least cut the movie some slack. It feels the heart of the comic books, as it should. & Stan Lee himself couldn't be happier. I personally liked the original as a child. It's got some chuckles & ""cool"" fight scenes. People may not remember it, but I do. They put realism on the makeup for the Thing, some rivalry between Reed Richards & Victor Von Doom. Hell, they even got Chris Evans as the Human Torch before he took Captain America to a whole new level. He really fits the personality of Johnny Storm: A hilarious, attractive-looking troublemaker who has a thing for the ladies. I'm sure that really fits for the actual Johnny Storm in the comic books. Whenever I watch the film now, my childhood sprung back to me. In conclusion, even if the remake coming over the summer has spectacular reviews, I still would feel more for the original, even if I DO happen to it. No matter how my fans cheer for the remake, I will mention the 2005 film, & how it really gets into the tone to the comic books. There could be at least others who liked it. & if there are, I would really appreciate it. Should I create an anniversary tribute for the film? I could really use some support. Thank u & move on.

I know not many people care about this but these super hero movies are watched by all ages and races and I think it's important for children of color to see a black hero that is not just a sidekick (Falcon)but a well known main character on screen. Not saying this has to be done with all the Marvel/DC films but one change ain't gonna hurt nobody.

2015-01-28T19:09:19,"I love making older comics more racially diverse, but this just doesn't make any sense.  You now have to change the dynamic of the characters' relationships to make #JohnnyStormblack.  Because Susan Storm/the Invisible Girl(Woman) and Johnny Storm/ The Human Torch are brother and sister. The only way they can make this into a plausible story is if:  1. Sue Storm and Johnny Storm are both mixed, Sue just having a lighter complexion.   2. Sue and Johnny are brother and sister by marriage or adoption,  which could actually work, IF they dedicate enough backstory to it in the movie.  3. They aren't related but are as ""close as family"".   4. This seems the most likely route to be taken based off the clip. Most or all of them are just randos thrown together who bond over almost dieing and getting superpowers.   This is just there attempt to add a black guy(diversity) into the main cast. They can't make #VictorVonDoomBlack becuse he's a bad guy, people would be pissed that a black guy is being equated to evil. They can't make #BenGrimmBlack because he wouldn't get as much movie time as a black guy before he becomes The Thing. And not to mention if sequels are made or crossovers done (which is what they want) he'd have no time as a black guy unless they have a flashback or they lose their powers like they did in the other F4 movie. And they don't want to make #ReedRichardsBlack because they're too afraid to piss off the fans with that. I'm not even going to acknowledge the fact that they also don't want to have a black guy as the leader of the team.    The problem is, any racial or cultural change will piss off fans, so they might as well do the smart thing and make Reed the #tokenblackguy instead of screwing up the story.

I'm talking about X-men last stand, they ruined, de-powered, or just not include some of the coolest superheroes, and they found room for ones nobody knew or cared for... Don't make me start on the fact that one awesome x-men advertised on poster that he would play a big role, ended up having less than 5 minutes on the screen...

Now, that being said, this is a bold move, but maybe a more artistic and business like decision. The other two Fantastic Four movies were closer to the comic books and they were not hits. I think Chris Evans did a great job as Johnny Storm, but he makes a better Captain America.  Of course, you do alienate the core audience when you do a reimagining, yet look at the success of ""Battlestar Galactica"" when they made Starbuck a woman and Tighe who was black in the series became white and Adama was played by a Latino actor and his son Apollo was a British actor.  If the other two ""Fantastic Four"" movies had done well, then you would not have this drastic change.

2015-01-28T23:35:50,Hope they don't chase the relationship between Johnny and Susan as siblings because of the cast difference or its already gonna be a rocky start. They shouldve done a slow integration of the new actor like how they started samuel Jackson by putting him at the end of iron man. We got used to seeing him and it came as a surprise which worked out fine. Hopefully itll still surpass people's expectations tho. Looking forward to an avengers/scroll invasion movie for avengers 3.

2015-01-29T03:49:50,Okay I've been looking at the comments about people complaining that the human torch is black and Honestly I don't care about Race or what kind of ethic background a superhero has but the thing that throws me off is the story.  What I mean by that.... well if you read or watch an original story about a superhero and his/her background story and then years later when they are making a reboot or sequel/prequel about  your favorite super hero. Your  kinda expecting that your favorite hero will have the same background story that he/she had before.  But then again they did said that this movie is a reboot sooooo that means this story is fresh out the bat. Every character will not be any similar to the comics soo that means this reboot movie is totally different from what we had before.

2015-01-29T08:51:36,"""The complaints about the Jordan casting seem to boil down to these core arguments:  -Johnny Storm has always been portrayed as a white character. -Hollywood shouldn't try to change a character's race just for the sake of political correctness or money. -Audiences will be confused if the race of this iconic superhero character is suddenly changed. -Having a black Johnny and a white Sue means the characters aren't brother and sister anymore.  To which I offer these rebuttals:  Yes, and so were Kingpin, Heimdall, Perry White, and Nick Fury at one point. Unless you've read the script and sat in on the production meetings, it's a little presumptuous to claim you understand the motivations behind this decision. Just like that time everyone's brain melted when WB replaced Billy Dee Williams' Harvey Dent with Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face? A mixed-race family? That's unpossible!  To elaborate one point #1 further, I think a lot of people are forgetting that changing the race of a character isn't even unheard of in the Fantastic Four franchise. Jessica Alba is part Hispanic, and she played the traditionally white Sue Storm in the previous two FF movies. I don't recall anyone complaining back then. Is there a certain threshold in terms of skin color an actor has to cross before it suddenly becomes offensive?  Of all these complaints, the only one I can see any merit in right now is #4.  When the rumors about Jordan being offered the role first surfaced last year, I did feel a twinge of apprehension. They may be a superhero team, but the FF are a family first and foremost. The fact that the previous set of movies downplayed the family element is one of many reasons why they weren't very good. It's also one of the reasons why The Incredibles is a monumentally better FF movie than Fox has been able to deliver. So if we're to take this casting as confirmation that Johnny and Sue aren't siblings, it doesn't bode well for the reboot or Fox's long-term handling of the franchise.  But there's no reason to assume that's the case yet. If anything, the fact that Johnny and Sue are different races could be a good thing. Re-imagining them as adopted siblings and part of a mixed-race family essentially forces the reboot to delve more deeply into that family element. The movie won't be able to simply take for granted that Sue and Johnny are brother and sister. It'll have to firmly establish that bond and answer questions like ""Are they related by blood or adopted?"" and ""What sort of family life did they have before becoming superhero explorers?"". Suddenly, the family element - that most basic and defining trait of the Fantastic Four - becomes a central theme of the movie.""

To have it closely resemble the comic enough where moron fanboys go and see it just because it says Fantastic 4, not using their brain power not to support bad movies like anything that has Spider-Man in the title, but not have it resemble it too much because the Fantastic 4 aren't as well known as Spider-Man or Superman to make a movie totally about it.

2015-01-30T02:13:33,"I have no problem with them making Johnny black. Hell, if he can act the role well, then props to him. But there's just that little bit of me that feels unsettled; and that's because they've altered the source material to change races for....well.....'just because they can' reasons. Like when in The Last Airbender, there was a distinct lack of an Oriental (Far-Eastern) and Inuit cast, and instead replaced by a Middle Eastern and Caucasian crew. That really grated on me the wrong way; especially since the actors couldn't pronounce the character names right, or even act the roles right. I'm sure it is to do with 'widening the audience' and all that, but then I must ask: if that's the case, why are FOX thinking that less black people will want to view a film without a black protagonist? Do they have demographic-based studies on this, with conclusive and unbiased results? Or are they just assuming? Also....people need to revise their idea on 'racist'. The misuse of the term is as insulting as the actual subject itself, because it reflects just as much naivety and often dishes out unjustified judging of another. Racism is when you feel the need to discriminate against a race different to your own; often due to ignorance or a lack of acceptance of which is usually fuelled by social upbringing, lack of education and/or conformity. If someone's saying 'that's not right because it deviates from the source material', then that's not racist; it's factual, if the person is using the term 'right' under the principle of the adaptation being faithful to the source material. If someone's saying 'that's not right because he's black, and black people can't replace the role of a white person', then you have yourself a racist.",0,0,Kage,e-BVs-KCSiA,-0.02842775041050902,2015-01-30 02:13:33,True,True

The SJWs are the racist ones.  In a nut shell, I define racism as acting differently toward people based on their skin color.  SJWs are the ones looking at and basing decisions off of people's skin color.  They are the ones invalidating arguments because they perceive the person against them to be white, in addition to the fact that they are approaching it with a preconceived underlying notion that white people are racist.  What kind of hypocritical racist bigotry is that?  I'm black and I'm not going to see this movie.  What now ... to a SJW I just magically became white!!!

The whole sibling thing will interesting though (which is great imo because i find Fantastic 4 the most boring set of superheroes in Marvel and DC combined, excluding lesser know groups). Unlike other comments i highly doubt johnny and sue are mixed race because you know sue doesnt look black at all. Which can happen with a mixed family but with black genes being so dominate its extremely rare. The adoption idea would be great, if they actually play off it. I their parents treated one different so then they have some good backstory and chemistry. Most likely at least for me would be Sue and Johnny arent actually related. They both had a hard time and became a ""family"" to survive. My favorite theory would be, none of these characters are the original fantasic four. The originals died in a plane/car crash before they took the ride to space. These guys are the secondary crew. Throws all previous notions of the fantasic four out the window.

No Doom...  in the end though it doesn't matter a whole lot if it isn't exactly like the comics I mean before the Blade movie he wore a green jacket and had an afro so change could be good however you do walk a fine line with that because if it feels nothing like the FF then you are going to find it hard to please the FF fan base and if you can't get them on your side then you will find it hard to get new people on your side as well...  ",0,0,LazerDude,e-BVs-KCSiA,0.16806565656565658,2015-02-02 18:52:20,True,True

2015-02-04T14:13:31,"Did you know?: a group of linguists found that the English language was the best language in the world.   The Cornell-Bentley Research   A few years ago, a group of linguists carried out a research to find out the linguistic qualities of modern languages and the intellectual characterisitcs of their speakers. The research was based on a number of parameters (example:  economy of language, lexico grammatical simplicity and lexical richness). The study also included an inquiry into the psycholinguistic feeding produced by subjects from different parts of the world. The scientists concluded that the English language as spoken in the last two decades of the 20th century had outstanding qualities, standing out from the rest of the languages in the world. In addition, they reported that this language was necessarily the communication means of highly-evolved, highly-civilized human beings. According to the scientists, the evidence showed that the English language was beyond the expected standards, and that the speakers who originated this language had massive neuronal connections at the level of the cortex and a high rate of intercommunication between the cerebral hemispheres at the level of corpus callosum. On the other hand, languages like Spanish and Italian were below the linguistic standards -therefore they called them “low-level languages”- and their speakers showed weaker cerebral settings. After the results of this study were known, certain economic and political corporations strongly forbade the scientists from revealing either the details of the study or its results. Seemingly, the corporations fear that this study may cause socio-political distress in non-English-speaking countries, leading to an eventual fall in the exportation/importation flow of English-speaking countries. As a result, this research is not available in the Internet or any other place, representing a real breach of the right of free speech guaranteed by the American constitution. Because of this, a group of citizens concerned with this situation decided to launch a campaign against this breach of rights and are currently making this study known to the world.",0,0,arkox8,e-BVs-KCSiA,0.10447916666666666,2015-02-04 14:13:31,True,True

Spiderman was re-invented without the juvenile insults he spewed to villians as he fought them.  They toned down spidey's dark side.   It worked for them.    FF characters are very stereotypical.   I am not sure how they can make Mr. Fantastic appear more real or attractive.   He is presented as an aloof nerd that no one can understand, and his superpower, although fantastic, makes him appear silly.    Reboots of FF have greatly improved Susan Storm from being lame to being powerful, by enhancing her invisibility to also be a force field.    Johnny Storm is cool enough, but he is meant to be shallow.  I don't think you can do much with his character.  Perhaps he can also be an iron chef, cooking his own creations.   JK.  Computer Graphics may have become good enough that the Thing can appear more real, but they need to overhaul his personality, perhaps even dropping the ""It's clobbering time"" tag line.  Perhaps the Thing can be made better by adding more to his backstory, like being a martial arts specialist.",0,0,Accidental Lyrics,e-BVs-KCSiA,0.11360131931560503,2015-02-05 07:42:55,True,True

They're are siblings. This ruins everything!'  Are you people ignorant or just stupid? Have you heard of adoption? Or are you just making comments to fuel the hate? If you are so concerned about it then you would have searched the topic and found out that they are ADOPTED AND ARE SIBLINGS. It messed up nothing ! If anything it adds more tension between Sue and her FAMILY RELATIONSHIP!  This is what the fantastic four is about! FAMILY AND EXPLORATION OF THE UNKNOWN! People are acting like they are diehard comic book fans of this team. If all of you complaining were they wouldn't have had some of the least comic book sold. If you care so much buy the books. The last issue is coming out soon. The human torch is white in there. So go get that and stop trolling over race!  It sickens me how many people but into these comments out of hate or stupidity.

2015-02-09T08:03:58,"Since the whole premise of the comment section seems to be based not on if it looks good or bad but how wrong or not wrong it is about changing the race of Johnny Storm, I'll comment on that. Growing up, the Fantastic Four was my favorite comic for a while. Within the group, Torch was my favorite character. When I heard the starkly blond hothead I had been fond of was getting played by a Black man, I was shocked more than anything. I say this as a person of color. But there were a few things I had to consider.  1. There are so few leading Black characters within Marvel popular enough to warrant lead or major roles on the Silver Screen. Blade (The only successful marvel movie franchise with a Black lead role thus far, but that's long past) Black Panther (in production), Storm and Bishop (not lead roles but in the X-men cast) Nick Fury (wasn't even originally Black either). Kingpin (same as Fury) Heimdall (same as Fury and Kingpin) Falcon (added to the Avengers roster) and a few no-name characters scattered throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Fox Marvel Universe.   As we can already see, so few relevant Black roles and embarrassingly almost half of them are because they were altered from their original White selves.  2.I am not a fan of the Johnny Storm change however, if things like this were not done, you would see 99% White faces. Nothing wrong with being White but..erm.....how do I put it.....it's not 1965 anymore. Even in the likes of Blade, practically all of his allies and partners are White. What is Marvel Studios going to do? Make a Monica Rambeau movie? There are not enough premier Black characters to go around. Now I TOTALLY disagree with altering a character as Iconic and major as Johnny Storm, but I do understand is what I'm trying to say I guess.",4,1,Mai A,e-BVs-KCSiA,0.02427536231884058,2015-02-09 08:03:58,True,True

2015-02-10T08:24:36,"Talk about controversy.  This particular film has tons of it.  The race of Johnny Storm continues to enrage and engage the masses.  I'm not posting this to be critical of anyone's particular opinion.  I'm only posting this to offer something to think about.  I'm white. I used to have the same reaction. I hated it when character's races were changed for TV and movies. And it was happening a lot. It still is. I would always think ""why can't they create a new character who is a different race instead of changing one that has been portrayed as white for decades?"" But the problem, though, is that almost all of the most popular characters and concepts were created during the lily white heyday of chomics.  From the 1930s through the 1960s and maybe even 70s - very few major characters were depicted as any other race than white. So translating any of the more popular concepts to other media unchanged would mean films where all of the protagonists are white. The major characters and heroes and people who make a difference are all white. Have you even thought about that? The message it sends is, ""White people are the only ones capable of being heroic"". Which is baloney. So your reaction, much like mine initially was - is basically saying ""These are my toys! MINE!! Get your own!"" I like the idea that children of other races can go into a movie like Fantastic Four and they will see a hero that they can relate to - who also happens to be the same race. I think that's a good message to send to a child. Sure, the makers of the film want their product to be racially diverse to attract a wide audience which means more dollars. But I think it also happens to be a socially responsible thing to.  ",1,0,atomcrush,e-BVs-KCSiA,0.12813325563325564,2015-02-10 08:24:36,True,True

2015-04-19T14:57:46,"Fantastic 4 reboot. Comment. Correct me if I am wrong, but wouldnt AFFIRMATIVE ACTION mean you interview a bunch of people for a movie role, and pick the best ACTOR for the part reguardless of age, race, gender, or sexual preference? Isn't that kind of a contradiction, as well, in some cases? As an actor, why would you audition for a part of an old racist southern gentleman, if you were a 20 yr old, asian female? FURTHERMORE, lets be very CLEAR on this part... AFFIRMATIVE ACTION is not the DIRECTOR saying, ""let's make this character Indian, and this character a woman."" That is just changing the script, but it in NO WAY makes anything better. I think I can safely speak for the masses, when I say that all that is needed is for the casting crew to FAIRLY consider any actor with the skills, and nesecarry attributes to do the job, so long as ethnicity or gender isnt ALREADY a staple of the character. (Case in Point, NICK FURY... GREAT CHOICE for actor because reguardless of race he embodies the spirit of that character.) NOW... on to Johnny Storm... how is Susan explained to be his sister in this movie without a complete nonsense rewrite of adoption, different father, albinoism, or something else nonsensical and uneeded? TOTALLY USELESS REWRITE... IN GENERAL the 2 actors chosen for these parts should appear to be brother and sister. So unless this is a SHAMEFUL ATTEMPT to hipster thier way into AFFIRMATIVE ACTION... then they would have cast one part, then IMMEDIATLY eliminated anyone who didnt appear to be relatable to the first chosen actor. In that way if this gentleman (who I think will do fine as the character Johnny Storm) was cast first, then Susan should at the very least appear to be his sibling, so the audience can just sit back, not think about the obviouse connundrum  of these already astablished characters, and enjoy the show. NOW, if this was a new movie with new never before introduced characters, and you want to toss them together and say they are sibling... COOL... its a new world... I get that this is plausable, and acceptable. But those are not established characters that come with certain prerequisit expectations.

There was so much potential, there were such decent actors and these trailers were filled with so much more depth and plot than the movie itself.  Fox what did you do to the Theatrical version of this movie?? Why did you make it so short and literally change the final product from what was being advertised. Why didn't you let Josh Trank add more depth like he wanted to? Why did this feel neither like a movie made for kids nor one made for adults while shitting on everyone's intelligence.
