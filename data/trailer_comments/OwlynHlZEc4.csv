2014-06-24T12:57:09,"""Family killed by the Gods"" So Hollywood is still too pussy to acknowledge that Herc killed his family himself, even though it happened because the Gods made him briefly insane. Yeah, way to take away a major inner conflict for your main character which actually is the whole reason for him doing the 12 labors. By the way, why can't Hollywood just make THAT as a movie. The Twelve Labors is the central Herc story and has enough story for an entire movie franchise. Why does it always have to be lame LOTR/Braveheart-copies with massive battles? Correct me if I'm wrong because I'm not THAT knowledgeable about Hercules, but I can't remember any of his stories involving him to be some sort of big army leader. He usually walked around alone or with a small group to go on adventures. I really wish someone would make a really ambitious Hercules movie with a good story and good actors that stays relatively true to the myth, rather than making it just a cheesy action fest. Well at least THIS Hercules looks a thousand times better than the other one earlier this year. At least this one has some aspects of the myth like the Lion, the Boar or the Hydra.",136,4,Wurzelknecht,OwlynHlZEc4,-0.030890804597701146,2014-06-24 12:57:09,True,True

It was actually refreshing that they put there own spin on the story of Hercules instead of trying to be 100% accurate on everything as some are complaining about. I think the Rock did well in this. A shame folks will always blindly dismiss him as an actor because of his background as a wrestler.  Way better telling of the 'Hercules' story I've seen in recent memory (way better than that shit that came out earlier this year).,0,0,GEMINIVice1,OwlynHlZEc4,0.22999999999999998,2014-07-26 00:19:47,False,True
