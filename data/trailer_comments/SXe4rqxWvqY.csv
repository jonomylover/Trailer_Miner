After has been a problem in the 1d fandom for fucking years because besides being incredibly disrespectful towards harry, by virtue of it being a ~~harry styles fanfiction~~ on wattpad it attracted A LOT of younger girls who were then exposed to a really really unhealthy relationship dynamic that they are encouraged to want and romanticize because it has their idol.  So yes while the sentence “theyre turning a one direction wattpad fic into a movie” is really funny out of context as someone who has been following 1d since before after’s conception and watched firsthand all the bullshit it caused im really encouraging everyone to think about this and maybe give it the criticism it deserves.""",0,0,Alyssa Bullock,SXe4rqxWvqY,0.09723502304147467,2019-01-04 02:31:50,True,True
