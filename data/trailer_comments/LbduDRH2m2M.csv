2015-12-14T05:22:33,"The way I always picture a sequel in my head, although it's a little cliché, is that when alien connected telepathically with the President it was too much information all at once and he only saw glimpses of the last part of the connection. Over time, it slowly started unravelling and the consciousness of the alien was imprinted in his mind, driving him partly mad with the information, and weakening his constitution to the point where he was mentally being taken over by the alien consciousness. Secretly, it was keeping the President under control subconsciously. It waited until it had enough control to make him fulfill tasks, and made him send a message out to the main alien fleet once humans had reversed engineered the tech to use their power source, and their communication technology. During/After, he was discovered. The President, in a moment of lucidity, agreed he needed to be kept locked away or in solitary, but no one could tell if the alien was still in control or not and just agreeing to save itself, if the he was still under control, or if the alien was also slowly being influenced by the human memories/emotions/etc and falling back to more even ground mentally with the President/human, since he was openly telling them about the information that was unravelling in his mind as he was going mad.   Another aspect being that their entire civilization only became ""like locusts"" because they were driven off by another race that behaved the same way. With their civilization's home destroyed, they obsessed over it. The militarization of their entire race started happening, vowing that it would never be a victim again, but the victors. They started engineering themselves biologically for war and occupation, intially not destroying worlds but forcefully occupying them. Over time, they cared less and less about saving life from extinction as they occupied and saw it as a hindrance on their goals. The military-like leaders put in a type of emotional block while growing new soldiers so they would not disobey orders and do what needed to be done. They started going from one system to another just like those who drove them from their own world. The alien's partial consciousness in the ex-President's mind, being exposed to the human emotions confused and started affectimg it, breaking down some of the emotional blocking it had, making it go a bit insane as well trying to understand and process it. With them both kinda losing it, they started understanding one better, having lucid mental conversations of a sort for short periods of time.  I had many more ideas of how to go about it, but I'll leave it at that. Thanks for reading, anyone who took the time. :) Peace.",1,0,demonsorrows,LbduDRH2m2M,-0.06296717171717171,2015-12-14 05:22:33,True,True

His goofy smile is nearly impossible to hide when it's time to be deadly serious, so it betrays the required emotions on the screen. This movie might end up being better without him.  It's either (1) his schedule couldn't accommodate ID:R, (2) Fox didn't want to pony up $20+ million, or (3) the screenplay is so bad that Will said no to $20+ million.

I have to say though, one of the reasons ID4 was so good, and has aged so well is the gritty look and the great use of practical effects. I am not going to judge this movie on one trailer of course, but it does appear to be sadly lacking both of those aspects. It looks no different to a hundred other shiny sci fi movies at this stage.

2015-12-15T11:01:39,"It's exactly the same movie, minus Will Smith and Randy Quaid, with the usual enhanced CGI no doubt, that will equal 'more dramatic' or frightening scenes. The first film has been on a loop on one tv channel over christmas. The original still looks half decent, from 1996. Nothing new or original in this trailer though, so it might only be worth watching if you haven't seen the first  according to cinemablend If you watched the debut trailer for Independence Day: Resurgence that dropped earlier today, you probably noticed an interesting lack of Will Smith's Steven Hiller.  In reality this is because the actor wound up being too expensive for the production, but given that the character's son is one of the main heroes of the movie, many have wondered exactly what happened to the hero.

2016-01-03T21:31:07,Anything with that type of mass such as that ship literally creates it's own form of gravity. Magnetic poles even. Counteracting the gravity and magnetic poles of the earth then the earth would move. Even if slightly moved out of orbit this would cause all sorts of weather damage the world over. This is why I believe the earth has gotten lighter which means the sun's gravitational pull is now slightly stronger causing the earth to move slightly closer in it's orbit around the sun. This could very well be the cause of global warming. An object the size of that ship adds weight to the earth slightly weakening the sun's gravitational pull thus causing the earth to move slightly further away in it's orbit around the sun thus causing global cooling.

2016-01-03T21:45:36,Another interesting thing about planetary weight is that it don't just disappear by itself. Last ice age couldn't have been caused by a giant meteor strike. A passing giant asteroid would've affected all the planetary orbits throwing everything out of whack. This brings me to the conclusion that we were visited in the past. Like I said planetary weight don't change by itself. Someone or something landed a huge something (intergalactic ship perhaps?) on the earth causing a global cooling and had to leave because of the extreme temperature of winter set in globally. Could've been done purposefully in order to create less aggressive creatures to populate the earth. Namely us. We could've been left behind for all we know. The writing on the wall in cave & tree were to guide us or jog our memories.  We could've been an experiment to learn about genesis. How everything was created. We forgot so others could learn.

Most of the authors of aliens books say that if someday we are visited by an extraterrestrial race, there are two chances; 1.- They come to help us in our development as race and society teaching us the use of technology for a better life quality; 2.- They're hostiles, here are two more possibilities, a) They won and take over the planet, b) They lose but they come back with renforcements and try again, so considering all of this, is more than logic that they would come back as per the 20 years after maybe for them there wasn't 20 years, remember all the Interstellar stuff about time in space, they're probably getting back right after they knew they were defeated:  Other points that worth to be mentioned:  - President Whitmore dreaming about 'they're coming back'. Has a lot of sense, why? Remember one of them get into his brain, and intencionally (or not) they created a connection with a human, so it's logic Mr. President can see or feel things, specially because aliens use Telekinesis to communicate each other.  - Using their technology, David Levinson says that is to strengthen our planet, maybe that wasn't the first intention but it makes sense, how often can you make experiments out of a completely new technology.  - Different space ships and plan, of course if their original plan didn't work they must use another tactics and better gear.",0,0,Miguel Resendiz,LbduDRH2m2M,0.19564639905548997,2016-02-22 17:10:31,True,True

They almost did it right with the human forces fighting the aliens inside the huge ship in that alien environment but that scene was terribly short and terribly misused.

However, the idea of the Alien Queen was interesting. There are two main things I would've changed to the movie: No CGI aliens (Make them look realistic like back in 1996) and make the plot a little more serious. Me and some of my friends thought it was filmed for a more younger audience unlike the first movie. And the story seemed too rushed for some reason. The introduction of another extraterrestrial race is interesting, a more peaceful one than invasive, but could've gotten into way more detail about them. One thing I really liked is how they brought Dylan back from the first movie now as a grown young man taking after his father. In other words, the movie was fairly okay to watch, but like most sequels attempting to be as good as the original, they could've put a little more effort into developing it a tad better.
