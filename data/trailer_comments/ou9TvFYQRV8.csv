We were both skeptical at first..but it was just so funnnnn watching some of the monsters come to life. We were literately jumping out of our seats and pointing at monsters we remembered from the stories!!!!! Good times, good memories.   It made me want to read the books again sooo badly!!!!!But I'm scared of reading them now...when I was a kid..I'd read it late at night and it would be soooo creepy..but im fairly sure if i read it now, it wont be scary......So I'm gonna just buy it for my little sister. And probably rewatch this with my younger sister.   People who are complaining about this movie not being a horror are being a little ridiculous. If this movie was a horror, it wouldnt be for kids or teens-which was exactly what the books were directed at. And also, if it was a horror movie, it wouldnt really be scary(it would probably end up trying to be scary but be silly-in a bad way)If anyone wants the creepy feeling based on the books, watch the goosebumps series. They're sorta ok.   ...i think they made the right choice to make it funny. Just seeing some of the monsters brought back the old feeling of being scared. which was awesome!   I heard there might be a planned sequel..and I hope there is!!!!!!!
