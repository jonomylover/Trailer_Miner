2018-01-24T18:29:06,"Ok,so let's break down everything wrong with this trailer.  1. Feeling of weight. Now pardon me if I sound like a billion other people when saying this,but unfortunately it is quite a prevalent issue,HOW IN THE FLYING FUCK ARE THE JAEGERS MOVING AROUND LIKE THAT?! It looks as if they're hollow cardboard cut-outs in terms of weight. I don't care if this is sci-fi,you have to at least TRY to have a hint of realism in there,otherwise you break the suspension of disbelief. And quite frankly,a 7000 ton,250 foot tall robot wouldn't be able to do half this stuff without collapsing under it's own weight. This looks like a freaking video game.  2. The setting. In the first movie you were always in the dark and the rain. The only true daylight scenes are in the beginning and the end of the movie. This is supposed to convey humanity's downward spiral towards the later half of the war,the twilight before the destruction of everything. The beginning is bright to signify humanity uniting and temporarily winning against the threat and the end...well ends with a sunrise to signify the beginning of a new era of peace. In this one it looks like a Michael Bay movie. No drama,no suspense,nothing,just bright sunny days to emphasize...idk. Also,in the first the darkness served a practical purpose as well,disguising some of CGI. Now don't get me wrong,the CGI is amazing,but inevitably there are going to be parts that look crappier that others. But that's the good thing about the darkness,that it hides these below average effects and let's you fully enjoy a scene without breaking the immersion. In this one...I refer back to my video game point.  3. The designs of the Jaegers themselves. These are incredibly generic designs for mechas. Aside from Gipsy Avenger,who's already ripping off two existing designs,namely the OG Gipsy and Striker Eureka,none of them stand out. In the first one,each Jaeger had a unique design which told exactly who they were and what fuction they played. Cherno's the tough bruiser,Crimson's the nimble fighter,Gipsy is the heroic brawler and Striker's the futuristic one. Now,all of them are the Striker Eureka archetype,except this time it's uninspired and old.  And finally,this might be just a problem with the trailer but still: 4.The music. In the first you had booming orchestral themes evoking the epicness of the situation and a sense of grandeur. Here,you have a shitty ass pop song that sounds like a million others meant to just appeal to the kiddies that wanna be ""lit"" and ""cool"".  It's pathetic how much of a sellout this feels. Pacific Rim seems to be another franchise that's succumbing to having it's soul sucked by the corporate executives. And I really,really hope I'm wrong about this and it turns out alright,but as it is now...Cthulhu help us.",166,64,Godzilla 123,8BAhwgjMvnM,0.04554850833920603,2018-01-24 18:29:06,True,True

They did look pretty solid in some shots, and while little was given away about the story, it looks promising. Despite definitely being a different movie, you can now see more clearly that this is, like the original, a character-driven story. So... I don't know. Maybe this will still be good after all. I hope so. I'd scream if the sequel to my favourite movie of all time sucked! Why did you have to leave, delToro? Why? At least delToro was still a co-writer of the script, so it'll hopefully be good.  That said... please keep the music of the original! Pleasepleaseplease! I know it's a different composer, and of course he can do his own interpretation, but there just has to be at least one scene, preferably a drop scene, with the full, barely changed main theme from Ramin Djawadi!

And so what the new and more approve jeagers lost some height they are still better then the order ones and for those who said this is like power ranger or heck even transformers but they are not do, do the jeagers look like they are going to transform into cars or a freaking jet no they don’t, or do these guys look like they are going into some spaceship where they can turn into some guys in fake armor that took them almost the whole movie to get it. and why you are hating on the music. it is a songtrack every movie has a song track and we don’t even know the song is going to be in the movie. Maybe the song was just to play with the trailer or something and that song was sick so stop hating. And why so every person on the movie need to be old I mean come on. You are going to hate on the movie because there isn’t no characters from the fish one. Are you kidding me are for real there’s is a lot of movies where they don’t have the same characters and they are still good.

Guillermo del Toro made the first one so epic because he realy cared about making this movie and bringing a mecha style movie to the west. This one is from another director and you can clearly see that. The combat and mechs look lighter and faster wich in my opinion is a bad thing. The slow, heavy and mechanical way the mechs moved in the first one added alot to style and tone off the movie. The colours are also just off. This movie looks like it will almost all be in daylight with just bland collours. The previous movie was way darker with small neon lights in between it and heavy rainfall making the mechs all wet and reflect the small lights. None off the amazing collours from the previous movie are present in this one. It looks more like a transformers movie then the next Pacific Rim.

Here, of course those roles are fulfilled but their general designs obviously look very similar.

But this trailer looks bad to me, now I really want this movie to be good. Hell, fuck good, I want it to be great, like the first movie. But it looks bad. Here's my opinion (agree of disagree, I would love to hear more peoples opinions) first of all, the actual jeagers. They look like shit, in the first movie, they had personality, you wouldn't confuse one with another. Each one of em looks like they would be built from the country they were from. Also, they moved like actual robots, slow, and heavy. Like Cherno Alpha moves has slow movement, and they give a scale of weight on him just by the way it sounds and moves. While Crimson has slow graceful movements ts, and also has a scale of weight on him. In this one, they all move they their weightless. Second, the story kinda looks cheesy, but the first move was cheesy but let's hope they don't go over bored. 3, in the first movie. The characters had to have things attached to the suit, that would move the jeager, it have weight on the actors and you could tell, they had a hard time moving, it gave the robots a feeling that you needed to know what you were doing to operat one of the jeagers. Now they don't have one. And that kinda sucks. Anyway, that's my opinion if you think differently, or spotted something I said that wasn't true.

2018-01-25T01:50:03,A lot of people are complaining that this isn't the same gritty or dark feel as the first movie. A lot of people's issue with the first was that the characters took themselves too seriously. This movie is designed to be an excuse for giant robots and monsters fight. Pacific Rim isn't getting a sequel because it had a great story. Its getting a sequel because it was a fun movie with a lot of epic moments that has a good chance of making  lot of money a second time.,141,13,Walker Michaud,8BAhwgjMvnM,0.14358974358974358,2018-01-25 01:50:03,True,True
2018-01-25T01:50:17,"Frankly this looks terrible. There were tons of caricature in the original Pacific Rim that made it funny and campy, but it was also gritty and mechanical. The original PacRim jaegers were different in structure in order to counter the large variety of kaiju - the sequel makes all kaiju look the same. Why there is infighting amongst humans when species extinction threatens all is such an awful hook. Worst still is how some teenager managed to come up with a technology that took scientists years to perfect with human casualties involved in it. Dealbreaker for me was the rap music... Why?

To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping people from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",0,0,Sinner SavedByGrace,8BAhwgjMvnM,0.0862179487179487,2018-01-25 02:27:51,True,True

What was awesome about the fights in the 1st movie was that you got the emotional impact of the fight, you felt some level of connection with each Yaeger's pilots, and when each one went down swinging, it brought a tear to my eye. The orchestral score was rhythmic and mechanical to match the mechanical nature of the Yaeger's. Now we have big Power Rangers basically. They fly, they transform, they fight in packs, they all have bright colors so you can tell which is which. Add in the teenager lead roles, and it's further proof this was a sequel that no one expected, and few people now want.

2018-01-25T04:29:13,"I wasn’t too sure about this after I watched the first time, but after watching again I think they have some pretty cool ideas. In Voltron and Power Rangers the mechs combine into one giant robot to fight the bad guys, but it looks like they turned that on its head and are making the kaiju “morph” together into one bigger enemy. The white mechs that open the breach have 3 fingers, it appears, and look very alien. Are they somehow controlled by the kaiju masters? Who on earth would strike a deal with them, and why? I like that the jaegers are still very different from each other, as in the first film it was stated that the kaiju were “adapting” to human jaeger tactics. The young pilots seem odd at first, but I would have made a way better pilot at 17 than at 30, so maybe it’s not that weird. The kids in Ender’s Game (the book) accomplished feats adults couldn’t because their minds hadn’t been put into boxes yet. I buy that.  Honestly this trailer doesn’t look great, but that’s what I thought when I saw the trailer for the first film, as well. I only gave it a chance because Del Toro’s name was on it. I strapped myself in for a terrible action movie. But after that first fight, where Beckett has to watch his brother get ripped out of the cockpit, then gets his jaeger torn apart, I realized I was actually watching a good movie, and changed my attitude. It was cheesy, silly, full of one-liners, fake action and plot holes, but it was a GOOD MOVIE.  This trailer looks bad, but so did the trailers for the originals. I’m still going to see it and I hope I’ll be as surprised as I was the first time.",36,4,triceranaps,8BAhwgjMvnM,0.03675213675213677,2018-01-25 04:29:13,True,True

This is its own movie and when you watch it you should feel that way because if you go to see it thinking that this is going to suck because it’s not the first then of course your are going to hate it. Give this movie a chance it’s its own thing. Also stop comparing this to the bayformers and power rangers because this isn’t a bad series and is actually has potential . Just keep your hopes up and try to enjoy the movie. If you cant get in your mind that this isn’t the same as the first then stop winning like a baby and just leave it alone and don’t see it instead of picking everything wrong with it out (besides the music because that dose suck) and complaining on a YouTube video.,5,5,Elias Jenkins,8BAhwgjMvnM,0.09000000000000001,2018-01-25 06:47:15,True,True

Look, the dark tones in the first film served its purpose. Hope was nearly gone. It would make no sense to do that again, because that hope is reguvinated. And a prequel wouldve just been a rehash of the first film.  I just dont get what is so wrong about being able to see these damn mechs now? Can anyone *really* say they fully enjoyed the fights in the first film? The ones with all the rain and mist, and majority of the film taking place at night?  I also like the mechs here are faster. I never did understood that, something giant moving slow, instead of moving like a regular person would. The Zord fight in Power Rangers 2017 had that problem too, hopefully that gets fixed in its sequel.  And when it comes to the new characters, one of the old characters from the first film is here too.

2018-01-25T13:37:40,"Lol I see a lot of comments saying that this movie lacks realism just because the jaegers are lightweight and can do backflips. The thing is, the majority of action-packed movie-goers do not expect realism in movies, especially a movie that involves giant robots and monsters. So when the producers think about this majority, it simply means more profit. If they make the movie too realistic, I believe not many people are gonna watch it, thus less profit. For the first movie, I heard many people didn't like the night battle, which is why they make the sequel with daylight battle.   Personally, I like the first one. And I know the sequel is gonna be good. Not great though. I don't mind if the jaegers manage to backflip, although I kinda agree that it defies physics. But who cares? As long as there are giant robots in action, I'm in.   Also, I think that most people who condemn this movie are actually gonna watch it, probably to condemn it more, which is kinda stupid.

The slow motion stuff looks pretty stupid, I really hope they don't use it much, because that's a cliche that can just go away.   Kidvangelion? Please, no.

Now, the EXTREEEEEME Jager jumping, leaping, and sliding? Please, God, no, why? WHY are giant robots weighing tonnes in the four digit range running around like this is Tron 2?

The weight behind their attacks made them feel way more satisfying to watch. The scaling also helped make the both the Jeagers and Kaiju seem huge and intimidating, making everything and everyone around them seem tiny and insignificant in comparison. And I know there's people out there who make the excuse that ""these are more advanced Jeagers."", yeah, but they're still giant mechas, they shouldn't be doing a lot of the stuff seen here.

The Kaijus were the same as well, flesh bobbed to and fro as they moved, giving the feeling that they truly are hulking masses of flesh and bone. Honestly, judging from the trailers, I might pass.

2018-01-25T16:32:14,"A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss. When the boss came, the story began.  -The client: is room 39 empty? -The boss: yes, sir. -The client: can I book it? -The boss: of course you can. -The client: thank you.  Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.  The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.  The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.  Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.  After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.  The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.  In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.  He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.  The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.  The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.  After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.  The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.  This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.  Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.  The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.  The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up.   To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.  The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.  In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.  -''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?'' -''I promise I will never let anyone know''. -''Swear'' -''I swear I won't reveal your secret'' So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.   Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.  When he does, I will let you know... thank you for reading.",28,14,Emilio DuhGoat,8BAhwgjMvnM,-0.014275132275132281,2018-01-25 16:32:14,True,True

(Revelation 21:8).   (Sorcery=Pharmakeia in the Greek Language=Pharmacy=DRUG USERS!   This is a freewill open door portal, to allow them to come into your body/temple of every foul and unclean Spirit/Demon.

(So when you are sinning against God you are sinning against your own Soul.   *** abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul. (1 Peter 2:11). (Lust is a name of a Demonic Spirit. Just like the Spirit of Anger, Homosexuality and Pride etc.   ***Now with this CERN/The Devils Portal being opened up in the name of, “Science”, this world is becoming HELL which, the Baphomet/Satan wants as his saying goes, “As above, so Below.” This is why you need to put the Blood of Jesus all over yourselves and your family members.

Submit to God and Resist the devil and he will flee from you!!! (James 4:7).   *** And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. (Luke 10:17).  ***Keep in mind, God will not allow Demonic Spirits to destroy mankind. Demonic Spirits, through mans freewill, is the only way they can cause harm to us and make us hurt or destroy our selves. Jesus, my king and hopefully your king as well, has them on a short leash or they would destroy the earth if they got the chance.   ***Remember, Demonic Spirits are inter-dimensional beings with alien bodies. Case in point, “The Greys”, are the working bees of SATAN!!!  *** For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

The movie had stretches where the action was abscent in favor of these stories that honestly came second to the main pull of these films, making me feel like a 10 year old again. Hopefully this time the film is more dense with that sweet sweet action, and that Boyega will liven it all up. If anyone is actually taking this shit seriously, they need to get a reality check.

2018-01-26T05:24:37,"I have some concerns  1. The movements of the jaegers- They just look too fast. I've been reading the comments and seeing people complain about the movements being to fast and people defending it saying ""Its set further in the future so of course they'd be faster"". The complaint about movement speed is stemming from the fact that because of how slow the movements were in the first movie it gave a feeling of weight and power to the jaegers, combined with the sounds it really felt like a 300 ton punching machine. Along with that I'd describe the fighting style of each movie as a heavy weight boxing/wrestling match for the first movie and ninja like fighting for uprising. I'm not entirely opposed to the fast movement decision if it was limited to 1/3 to 1/2 the jaegers, not most if not all judging by the trailer.  2.The jaeger design- This isn't as big of a problem but I'm not optimistic about most of the designs. Most of the jaegers seem to be going for the striker/typhoon slim design(though I'd say S/T did it better). It just seems to take away from the power of the jaegers making them seem like less of a giant machine and more(as people in the comments have already pointed out) seem more like transformers or power rangers. I do however like the look of(forgive me for not knowing his actual name) mace fist.  3. The characters- With the exception of John Boyegas character, the new characters look like they're going to be susceptible to the media trend of adding strong young/minority/female characters only to completely miss the mark and make them feel forced, lazily written and instead of being a strong character coming off as bitchy and unlikable(take Sarah Palmer from halo 4-5 as an example).   I love the first movie and yes, i know this is just a trailer and I'm desperately hoping its good, but the fact that its not being directed by Guillermo Del Toro is the main thing giving me concerns about this movie. The man knew what made his movie great and without his mind behind this, it is very hard to put faith in this sequel.",1,0,saberdragon20,8BAhwgjMvnM,0.09736310986310985,2018-01-26 05:24:37,True,True

The first one was a labor of love. Just watch the extras of the first Pacific Rim and you'll know what I'm talking about. You can immediately see the difference in animation. The Jaegers are moving too fluid in this one. The first movie they made the Jaegers move slow because they want to convey the massive size and weight of the Jaegers. In this movie what BS is this? The Jaegers don't feel big it doesn't even feel strong.,0,0,conyo985,8BAhwgjMvnM,0.1537037037037037,2018-01-26 05:25:50,True,True

2018-01-26T08:09:13,"Sad how the 'hip' thing is 'OMG it's not Directed by Del Toro it's just Transformers'....it is almost like nobody actually saw the first film. It was absolutely a cut above the average Transformers-type of blockbuster, but it was far from some flawless masterpiece.  The character archetypes used in the film were very pure and simple, they were all drawn in pretty one-note fashion. They've talked about how they are going for more complexity in the characters in this film.  Charlie Hunnam lacks charisma as a lead, ask the King Arthur movie. John Boyega has a lot more on-screen charisma.  The first film had pacing issues, and a middle chunk(Before the battle of Hong Kong) that takes too long to get going. It needed to be leaned out in the editing room. The Director is shooting for 2 hours with this film.  The first film shrouded all of its action scenes in rain, water, and night time. Interesting aesthetic choice, but fight scenes in broad daylight allow the fan to appreciate them in all of their glory.  The Director has stated his influences included Ultraman and Godzilla, which were among influences for Del Toro. They built off the Story Bible Del Toro developed on the first film. The notion of a Kaiju-Jaeger Hybrid? The concept of someone betraying humanity? Those are both ideas that Del Toro mentioned back in the early development of the sequel.  This movie is cut from the same cloth as the first film and honestly feels like a natural extension and evolution of that world. Only we're going to get a more charismatic lead, more interesting characters, and a better paced film. It's going to surprise everyone by being an improvement over the first film.",0,0,ChrisPeteG,8BAhwgjMvnM,0.21974489795918367,2018-01-26 08:09:13,True,True

Another thing is how bright everything is shot here, it felt more epic with all the major fights being at night since it made the colors of the cities, the Jaegers and the Kaijus being sliced and hit really stand out. Set the clips in the trailer at night and they would look way more epic.   And of course the music choice for this was fucking awful.

The Purpose of the Pan Pacific Defense Core was not only defeat Kaiju threats but also use as a way to share their technology with other countries in creating better Jagers without leaking top secret schematics. The Mark V Striker Eureka was the fastest one ever built, and it was essential to make faster Jagers since Catagory 4 Kaiju were smarter. In order to do so the builders found ways to make them slimmer and taller along with recreating the Drift System to help with reaction time.  For reference I look through the Universal Century of Gundam.

2018-01-30T04:08:10,"I understand that everyone is getting angry over the fact that the Jaegers are faster and sleeker in this version, but it actually kind of makes sense.   Uprising takes place, in Del Toro's words when he was still working on the project, ""A few years after the first one"". A few years could range from anywhere from 5 years to 15 years. Let's say it takes place 5 years ahead of the first one just in case. This amount of time allows for multitudes of upgrades to be made to the Jaeger design, and of course, the countries would continue to make them (because they would either be 1. Skeptical of a secondary alien invasion or 2. Skeptical of other countries abusing this mechanical power as a militaristic strength). When so many engineers and scientists are focussing on one thing at any given time, a LOT usually gets done. This means that the research and development could have skyrocketed without the impending Kaiju invasion. This explains why the Jaegers could be so sleek and faster.   I know everyone's getting pissed off about it, but I mean we're all really here to see massive robots v kaiju action here, so I still have hope for it (even if it's just a little bit).",0,0,Dalton Lonker,8BAhwgjMvnM,-0.07916666666666666,2018-01-30 04:08:10,True,True

For the love of God, did you discovered America?, the concept is the same, the only difference is the people they are trying to reach. Transformers have a lot of stupid and adult humor. Power Rangers is straight forward cheese and colorful for kids. Pacific Rim was a little more balance even the story was predictable. This movie has probably a little bit less budget than Del Toro's movie. Some of the effects looks great and maybe a few will not look as elaborated. But What difference will make if they go more for the Transformers silly fun audience or the more kids friendly? Maybe that the first Pacific Rim was not a big hit or people forgot?

2018-02-07T20:23:47,"Majority of Star Wars Films’ Writers & Directors Are White Men  07 Feb, 2018  A new report reveals that in 41 years of the Star Wars franchise, 96 percent of writers and directors hired by Lucasfilm for the movies are white men. George Lucas introduced the world to a galaxy far, far away in 1977 with Star Wars: A New Hope, a space opera he wrote and directed. The stories of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) captured the attention of moviegoers around the world and inspired a legion of dedicated fans spanning multiple generations. Though it seemed the franchise had concluded with the final installment of Lucas’ prequel trilogy, Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 and announced a revival of the Star Wars film series.  The episodic storyline was relaunched with J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015, but Disney and Lucasfilm also put standalone anthology movies into development, the first of which was Gareth Edwards’ Rogue One: A Star Wars Story in 2016. Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the latest entry of the franchise to hit theaters, but there are plenty more coming, including Ron Howard’s Solo: A Star Wars Story, Johnson’s new trilogy, and the recently announced series of films from Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. However, as Lucasfilm puts more and more movies into development, fans have wondered when the studio will hire a man of color, woman of color, or white woman to helm or direct a Star Wars movie.  Variety’s Maureen Ryan crunched the numbers in terms of gender and racial representation in major creative roles on the past and confirmed upcoming Star Wars movies. For 17 total films – including the original, prequel, and current trilogies, confirmed anthologies, Johnson’s trilogy, and the new series from Benioff and Weiss (which Ryan estimates will include three films, though Lucasfilm did not announce the exact number of movies they’ll produce) – Lucasfilm hired a total of 24 people in roles as writers or directors. Of those 24 people, all but one were white men; the exception is Leigh Brackett, who received a screenplay credit on 1980’s The Empire Strikes Back. Ryan summed up her findings: “Otherwise, no men of color, women of color or white women have held these positions. The franchise’s leading creative voices have been white men 96% of the time.”   For her findings, writers included anyone who received a screenplay or story credit on a Star Wars film. Ryan also included writers and directors who were fired from or left confirmed Star Wars projects, including Star Wars IX’s Colin Trevorrow as well as Solo’s Phil Lord and Chris Miller. However, Josh Trank, who was attached to direct a Star Wars standalone film before departing after the failure of his Fantastic Four, is not included in Ryan’s breakdown (though, if he were included, the percent calculated by Ryan wouldn’t change). The breakdown also only includes feature films, and doesn’t include those who have worked on Star Wars TV series like Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels.  To be clear, this breakdown of representation only looks at those who are writing and directing Star Wars movies; Ryan made note that the Star Wars movies released since 2012 have made strides in terms of more diverse casts and characters. However, movie writers and directors are undoubtedly the most important roles in terms of shaping and bringing these stories to life. And the call for more diversity in these creative roles extends beyond the galaxy far, far away.  With the likes of Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman and Jordan Peele’s Get Out finding critical and financial success, and hype surrounding Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther and Ava DuVernay’s A Wrinkle in Time, movie fans have made it clear they’re interested in stories told from other perspectives. While it’s possible Lucasfilm may hire men of color, women of color, and white women for their upcoming films – including those from Johnson, Benioff and Weiss – many fans are frustrated by the current lack of diversity in major creative roles on the Star Wars franchise. And looking at the numbers presented by Ryan, it’s clear to see why.

2018-02-10T19:45:26,"While I did think the chunky movements of the Jaegers in the original looked awesome, I don't really think this is that unrealistic to think about. After all, during the Kaiju War, they were under pressure to constantly develop better Jaegers. And we all know how well most people work under pressure. The movie was released in 2013, so it can only be assumed that the first Kaiju attacks happened in 2013. 14 months later, in 2015, they deployed the first Mark-1 Jaeger. TWO YEARS LATER, in July 2017, they deployed the Gypsy Danger, a Mark-3, which is shown to be notably more agile than the Cherno Alpha (Mark-1). And in 2019, they launched the Mark-5 Jaegers (of which we only know about Striker Eureka), which was a lot more agile than Gypsy Danger was, both before and after the Mark-3 Reactivation Program. Considering how much the technology advanced under pressure, where nobody had the time to sit down, relax and think things through properly, I'm not really surprised that the Jaegers in Uprising are in a whole different league than the ones in the original. And besides, they've had several years to develop new Jaegers, in case the Kaiju were to return, and it's not unrealistic to assume that the different countries would constantly try to do something better than the rest. I'm not sure I understand why there's a need for a Jaeger with a Morph Ball mode though, but I suppose there's only one way to find out. And that is by watching the sequel when it comes out.  And yes, I literally just re-watched the first movie. For the third time. I freaking LOVE that movie! I'm going to watch Uprising when it comes out, and I'm probably going to enjoy it like a child, since I'm a huge fan of the Mecha-genre.

2018-02-14T19:05:53,"To those here who are saying ""Oh my god this is just transformers but bigger, it's gonna be shit"" or ""looks like power rangers and shit. Gonna be a terrible movie"", stop and think for a moment. Lore wise, it makes perfect sense that the jeagers would evolve to become much more agile and maneuverable. Most of the jeagers in the first movie aside from Gipsy after being repaired and Striker were clunky and slow. Jeagers were destroyed because most of the time, the kaiju were much faster (i.e. Otachi blitzing Gipsy and Crimson).  Now look at this from an inspiration point of view. I can guarantee that these jeagers are inspired by Evas, Gundams, and Jet Jagur from Godzilla. This and the first one arent movies made to be some adaptation of an American cartoon. Pacific rim is supposed to be an American interpretation of the kaiju/mecha anime genre. Just look at how the jeagers move. They aren't moving like humans like a transformer and it's not cheesy and glamorized like a megazord. It's fluid but still robot like. You can tell they are being controlled and that they are still machines.   Bottom line, comparisons with transformers and shit shouldn't be made because they are nothing alike",124,50,Dennis Spencer,8BAhwgjMvnM,0.14473684210526316,2018-02-14 19:05:53,True,True

This sequel is not made out of the mould of the first one which is not a bad thing. But the first movie just seemed so real, the music was spot on and inspiring. It wasn't trying to be anything but just a good story. The focus wasn't on just the Jaegers and their pilots, but on many little things which all added to the flavor. Pacific Rim 2 just feels like a short episode of some robot action cartoon series which will have a lot of fighting and bad teen drama.

The way he said, ""It's definitely one of ours,"" to the other pilot when another Jaegar showed up in front of them. They clearly say that someone on their side let them in, meaning probably a key builder of the jaegars allowed the Kaiju to come in, and created more jaegars to beat up the other ones so...the Kaiju could wreak havoc? I don't know, but this is my theory. Like if you agree! I've been waiting for this movie since 2015, and now it's time.

Apart from being a genius, you seem like a very nice human being and I say this with respect to your operational and logistical problems that AFTER HAVING CREATED A MASTERPIECE WITH PACIFIC RIM 1, IT WAS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE IT WASN'T RUINED. IN FACT, AFTER SHARING IT WITH THE WORLD, IT ISN'T YOURS ALONE TO RUIN. (NO OFFENSE mR. dE kNIGHT).   Ever since i HAVE WATCHED THE TRAILER, i have been thinking about WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT NOW and here is what I think IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THIS SEEMINGLY IRREPARABLE BLASPHEMOUS BLUNDER -   Go to the bosses of LEGENDARY PICTURES AND UNIVERSAL and say this -   ""I realise that I have misjudged the ability of Mr. De Knight to do justice to the Epic Phenomenon called PACIFIC RIM.

At the end of Pacific Rim the Kaiju were already moving pretty fast and the Jagers were keeping up. How fast would these new Kaiju be now to merit stupidly faster Jagers? It breaks the immersion of a giant fight. Just take out all the buildings and all you see are robots fighting aliens not some grand battle against giant beasts.   And you also have the studio thing of let's have pre teen pilots to appeal to kids. And let's have more of everything (Jagers and Kaiju) so we can milk the toy market. That is literally what Transformers is and this is what Pacific Rim has become of it and you can see it in the trailers.

Theres nothing wrong with that, it just makes the film feel like im no longer watching pacific rim, the darkness and sinister approach, looks lost ... power rangers feat transformers, kids will love it but i personally am no longer interested if thats their aim.

I never again watch and read comments and trailers anymore. I loved the movie, it exactly got what I loved. The action, stunts, plot twists and to be honest, I kinda like this sequel. Also, I didnt find any annoying character here as in some movies there are. The blue light and feel of the base where Jags were was cool! What is more, I thought that I would really be upset to see super kids saving the day, but to be honest, the Amara was not annoying kid, she was genuinely likeable character. I liked the characters even though they didnt have enough developement, maybe Im shallow. I really wish this would got a good box office and we would see trilogy. Please, dont get distracted by bad comments here. If you liked the first you will like this too. Also, about the fast moving Jaegers, they felt heavy and big. I loved that they were more agile. Not all Jaegers were doing the flips. At last, do you know why I loved Pacific Rim? I have never seen anyone say this but, the thought of humans joining together, and creating bigger robot, which have looks like us, which just reflect our creativity, logic, nature and physic understanding. That our physic weakness goes away. Im not sure if I said this good but here are mine words.

First there was a lot of talking in the beginning and the action towards the end..why can't movies have both all together? Second they should have fixed their storyline. I think it's kinda stupid after so many years in the movie out of all the people walking around the entire complex with a boot camp for these titans and there is less than a dozen people that they are training. No big army of big robots, no massive fleet, just a group off kids that are being trained...wtf. At the end this movie really reminded me of Power Rangers (new one) and has the last line from the current new independence day of bringing the fight to the monsters...this movie is not so great...I found the quiet place more of an attention getter than this...",0,0,5 minutes alone,8BAhwgjMvnM,0.036002886002886,2018-04-23 02:23:41,False,True

There were several references to the black guy in the first film, probably because people would not remember who the new black guy is unless they referenced him every other scene. Only thing I thought was decent in this film, was the cgi.  Also, most of the cast are teenagers, with the senior officers being in their early to mid 20s. You'll enjoy this if you are barely into your teens or have the intelligence, sense of humor, and maturity of your typical 10-13 year old.  The movie is bad in my opinion.

2018-05-20T23:49:11,"IDK what people are talking about, this part is fine as solid shit (to me).  No hate, I love Raleigh Becket, I really hoped I could see him again in this sequel, but he was really predictable as a protagonist, everyone knew that he suffered trauma, that he would overcome it, that he would eventually win the Kaiju, somehow. He was somewhat a douche, he got into fights and shit but then an Asian woman would appear and slap him in the face for him to be righteous, we all saw that coming. But here, we got a black main protagonist who just doesn't give a single shit all the time even after his sister died, people don't know what the fuck he's gonna do, he just walks around like ""Yeah you can hate me to the bone but that's your problem idc lmao"", but later into the movie it shows that he actually cares, he actually knows his way around, and is a total badass. I seriously thought he was supposed to be the Commander since that Chinese Commander had death flags all over his head, and Nake along with Namani will do the job as Pilots. That's what makes this part stand out for me. An interesting main character. Same with the story, first we gotta admit both are shit, but this part got a really nice plot that the first one doesn't.

My biggest issue was with the kids they put in main roles. I didn't like a single one and at times it was downright annoying watching them and the sript was absolute garbage.
