I love all of Disney's live action films and yes I agree with Tarantino 's review, I think the Lone Ranger was actually pretty fun, but that's just me. while we're on the topic I really loved John Carter, Tron Legacy, and all of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies as well. the first pirates is literally in my top 10 films of all time. sometimes it's fun to watch some movies where you check your thinking hat at the door. don't get me wrong I love being challenged while watching a movie like Inception, memento, Kubrick's 2001 a Space Odyssey, excetera. not all movies need to be philosophical... At the end of the day they should be for our entertainment. in my opinion if it's entertaining then the film did its job. but hey, I'm just another fan boy that enjoys his flicks no matter the genre. film is my life and a lot movies got me through a lot of hard times in my life.
