I think it looks like this is a very dishonest trailer. I'm guess the marketing team went wild with disinformation after they began to panic about release a more cerebral film and now they're trying to make it look like a horror/monster/action movie (Which is most likely is not as the book was not and no one coming out of the cannes screenings seemed to be saying anything about a movie like the one in this trailer).

The fact that the Biologist's relationship with her husband was always one-sided, that she valued her time alone entrenched in nature was such a crucial element to the book. She didn't go into Area X to find her husband, he was a catalyst, but she went because it was in her biologist's instincts to do so. And where is John Rodriguez??? Why are there flower deer? I feel like the reason the books are so good is because there is such a strong element of mystery and yet here we are given everything on a platter.

And how do you even do that kind of horror on film? A lot of the horror in the novel has to do with just this feeling of wrongness, the things the protagonist is feeling, and... the things that ARE seen aren't monstrous so much as otherworldly, and almost impossible to depict on film, I'd say. The whole thing is very Lovecraftian. Plus, the text is so deep in the main character's head, focusing on her thoughts, memories, and perspective, that... Yeah, maybe I'm wrong, but I don't see this turning out well. Oh, well, at least this reminded me that I need to read the sequels.

As long as they push the atmospheric part of the film instead of making another *Special Effects: The Movie*, this has the potential to be good. My only gripe is that the cast is just a bunch of big names. They're looking to cash in on that alone because they know that the story probably isn't good. They also don't seem to be leaning towards the horror genre as much as I think they should. This could be a very unsettling horror film, where we expect explosions and high octane chase scenes but instead get mental meddling and suspense.

Seems Alex Garland didn't have a strong enough initial direction for the visuals and it was decided later to try and make them more dazzling with added light flaring. Maybe Garland always intended for lens flaring as a visual motif but was too tepid to commit to them irriversably on set, or had such a specific an idea of how he wanted them to appear that he didn't want to risk it on the anomaly of really trying to achieve them by glancing practical beem refractions off an anamorphic camera lens?

2017-12-14T02:14:50,"The book opens with a team of four who cross the border into an uninhabited area known as Area X. The team consists of an anthropologist, surveyor, biologist, and psychologist. None of the team is ever identified by name. The story is told through the biologist's field journal. They are part of the 12th expedition into Area X and it is revealed that the biologist's husband was part of the previous expedition into the same area. The narrator's husband returned unexpectedly from the expedition, showing up in their kitchen without any recollection of how he got there. The rest of his expedition show up similarly. A few months later he died of cancer along with the others in the 11th expedition.  After the first night spent at the base camp, the 12th expedition come upon a set of spiral stairs into the ground. Inside the staircase (which the biologist repeatedly calls a tower), they find cursive writing that begins with the words ""Where lies the strangling fruit...."" The writing appears to consist of a plant material growing several inches from the exterior wall. While the biologist is examining the writing, she accidentally inhales spores from one of the script-defining growths. After returning from the tower, the biologist discovers that the psychologist, who is the appointed leader, has programmed the group with certain triggers via hypnosis. By saying the phrase ""consolidation of authority"" everyone except the biologist immediately enters a state of hypnosis. The biologist believes that the spores she has inhaled have made her immune to the hypnotic suggestions and influence of the psychologist. The group decides to return to base camp for the night. At dusk, they hear a moaning noise from far away.  ""Where lies the strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner I shall bring forth the seeds of the dead to share with the worms that gather in the darkness and surround the world with the power of their lives while from the dim lit halls of other places forms that never were and never could be writhe for the impatience of the few who never saw what could have been.""[6]  After spending the night at the base camp, the anthropologist is missing the next morning; the psychologist claims the anthropologist decided to leave and returned to the border. The group then make their way back to the ""tower"" where the surveyor and narrator descend back down the stairs while the psychologist keeps watch. Eventually the surveyor and biologist come upon the body of the anthropologist. It is believed she came into contact with the writer of the text on the wall (which the narrator names the Crawler). When the group return to the top, they find the psychologist missing.  The biologist and surveyor decide to return to the base camp after a fruitless search for the psychologist. That night the biologist sees a light from the area of a distant lighthouse. The next day she leaves for the lighthouse while the surveyor stays behind. At the lighthouse, she finds a pile of journals from past expeditions, indicating that there have been many more expeditions than they had been told - among them is her husband's journal. The immediately preceding expedition which included her husband was actually ""expedition 11g"", with others stretching back to ""11a"", and so on. She also finds a photograph of what she thinks is the lighthouse keeper from 30 years previously, when Area X had been abandoned. Near the base of the lighthouse she finds the psychologist seriously injured. The psychologist becomes frightened by the biologist's approach and screams the word ""Annihilation"" repeatedly, which she later reveals is supposed to induce suicide in the biologist through hypnotic suggestion. The psychologist also reveals she had leapt from the top of the lighthouse trying to escape an unknown entity. Before dying, the psychologist tells the narrator that the border is expanding slowly northward. She also says that the biologist now has started to glow, her body emitting a dim yellow light.  On her way back to base camp, the biologist has a close encounter with the moaning animal she hears every night in the reeds. She is able to escape though she is ambushed by the surveyor. They exchange gun fire and the biologist manages to outflank and kill the surveyor, but is wounded in the process. She learns that being injured impedes the process of her ""brightening"" but that as she recovers whatever it is continues to take over her body.  Now the only surviving member of their expedition, the biologist takes time to analyse material she found on her way to the lighthouse and realizes that certain moss and decayed ""animals"" have human cells. She also finally reads her husband's journal of his expedition with an all-male team of eight explorers. The biologist's husband's team found the ""tower"" on their fifth day but did not explore it, moving to the lighthouse first. After discovering the huge pile of journals the team of explorers split up with two members choosing to explore the ""tower"", four deciding to remain in the lighthouse and the biologist's husband and his team's surveyor choosing to explore the land beyond the lighthouse. Finding that Area X seemed to stretch out indefinitely they returned to the lighthouse only to find that their team's psychologist had been murdered by a beast and then had somehow been resurrected and the rest of the men had turned on one another. Returning to the tower the biologist's husband and the surveyor were unable to find the other two men. They later see doppelg√§ngers of all the men (including themselves) except the psychologist, entering the tunnel. At this point the two remaining men decide to abandon their mission. The surveyor tries to return to the border via the way they crossed; however, the biologist's husband decides to repair a boat and try to cross back by following the shore.  Having read her husband's journal, the biologist decides to return to the tunnel to see if she can find the Crawler. She makes her way down the spiral staircase and eventually finds the Crawler. After a nearly fatal encounter, she manages to exit the tunnel. On the way out, she encounters the man from the lighthouse photograph. He is imprisoned by the Crawler and appears not to have aged at all. The book closes with the biologist stating she doesn't plan to return home. Instead she decides to stay in Area X and find perhaps any part of her late husband's presence which she believes remains somewhere in Area X.",4,0,sid assassin,89OP78l9oF0,-0.05954715219421103,2017-12-14 02:14:50,True,True

What is Brand X? (FCC v. Brand X) The question of whether Cable provides ""telecommunications services""(Telecom) or ""information services""(Info).  What is at stake? At stake is whether Cable must share Lines(Wires) with rivals--as happens in the phone industry--or whether they should be exempt from such rules.  Why Brand X have Right to Cable's Networks?

In the black water with the sun shining at midnight, those fruit shall come ripe and in the darkness of that which is golden shall split open to reveal the revelation of the fatal softness in the earth.

And there shall be in the planting in the shadows a grace and a mercy from which shall blossom dark flowers, and their teeth shall devour and sustain and herald the passing of an age. That which dies shall still know life in death for all that decays is not forgotten and reanimated it shall walk the world in the bliss of not-knowing.

2018-01-02T23:53:08,"Read the books, have been looking forward to this film for quite a while. Here's a few thoughts after watching the trailer a few times and reading through some of the comments.  The film is an adaptation, Alex Garland is not trying to reproduce the novel in exactitude. Keep in mind, many aspects of the novel don't translate well into film format. Garland is trying to present the gist of the novel, the atmosphere and certain elements of the original plot, in a format which will be an enjoyable and thought-provoking moviegoing experience. It will also be a new experience to the book readers, and not a rehash.  In an initial interview, Garland stated that he is basing the film off of the first novel only, and has no plans of doing a trilogy. Perhaps he later decided to incorporate elements of the next two books, but I have not read any interviews indicating so.  Jeff Vandermeer has, in fact, screened the film, and has praised the film in an interview (The Watch Podcast). Here's part of what he had to say: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually more surreal than the novel. There are a couple places where I was like, ‚ÄòI might need an anchor here.‚Äô The ending is so mind-blowing and in some ways different from the book that it seems to be the kind of ending that, like 2001 or something like that, people will be talking about around the watercooler for years‚Ä¶ Visually, it‚Äôs amazing. I must say that and that‚Äôs all I probably should say.‚Äù  Several commenters noted the similarities to Lovecraft, which is very accurate. Jeff Vandermeer is part of a literary movement known as ""the New Weird"" which draws from Lovecraft and many other authors of Weird Fiction. His earlier novel, City of Saints and Madmen, bears an even stronger semblance to the work of Lovecraft.  And finally, to all the comments complaining about the all female cast and whining about ""feminism"", you don't have a clue as to what you are talking about. The composition of this expedition is a very well though out aspect of the plot, not a political statement. The Southern Reach is sending out expeditions of varying compositions to see if the entity in Area X reacts differently to them. They have previously sent out mixed gender expeditions and all male expeditions, all of which resulted in failure. Also, the expedition members are scientists who happen to be carrying guns for self protection, it is not a military expedition sent in to exterminate.",204,13,alpha echo,89OP78l9oF0,0.09621699134199134,2018-01-02 23:53:08,True,True

2018-02-23T17:18:04,"i like the ""second order simulacra"" setting of the movie: in 1981 Jean Baudrillard wrote a philosophical paper, in which he seeked to examine the relationships among reality, symbols, and society, in particular the significations and symbolism of culture and media that are involved in constructing an understanding of shared existence.  4 Stages of Simulacra & Simulation:  The first stage is a faithful image/copy, where we believe, and it may even be correct, that a sign is a ""reflection of a profound reality"" (pg 6), this is a good appearance, in what Baudrillard called ""the sacramental order"".  The second stage is perversion of reality, this is where we come to believe the sign to be an unfaithful copy, which ""masks and denatures"" reality as an ""evil appearance‚Äîit is of the order of maleficence"". Here, signs and images do not faithfully reveal reality to us, but can hint at the existence of an obscure reality which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.  The third stage masks the absence of a profound reality, where the sign pretends to be a faithful copy, but it is a copy with no original. Signs and images claim to represent something real, but no representation is taking place and arbitrary images are merely suggested as things which they have no relationship to. Baudrillard calls this the ""order of sorcery"", a regime of semantic algebra where all human meaning is conjured artificially to appear as a reference to the (increasingly) hermetic truth.  The fourth stage is pure simulacrum, in which the simulacrum has no relationship to any reality whatsoever. Here, signs merely reflect other signs and any claim to reality on the part of images or signs is only of the order of other such claims. This is a regime of total equivalency, where cultural products need no longer even pretend to be real in a na√Øve sense, because the experiences of consumers' lives are so predominantly artificial that even claims to reality are expected to be phrased in artificial, ""hyperreal"" terms. Any na√Øve pretension to reality as such is perceived as bereft of critical self-awareness, and thus as oversentimental.",0,0,City Hunter,89OP78l9oF0,-0.0924963924963925,2018-02-23 17:18:04,False,True

It may broadly share some similarities with the book - but it got every single thing that made the book distinct and turned it into pure Hollywood sewage.  I don't even know where to begin, but I'll just point out the big ones:  * No lighthouse keeper - those insane sermons written on the wall of the tower?  Gone.  Replace them with HR Giger bulls**t, because clearly, that's what Hollywood sheep can compute. * The lighthouse, itself - It's too complicated to have the tunnel/tower separated from the Lighthouse, just smish those two together * The lighthouse, again - Just smash a meteor into it, we don't want to bother explaining the dormant alien in a hundred-year-old reflector * Biologist, Psychologist, Surveyor - Nope.  Just call them Becky, Annabelle, Juanita, or whatever disposable vapid name that the screenwriter crapped out. * Journals in the Lighthouse - We have cameras! Let's just leave an SD card behind for no goddamned reason. * Biologist, part the deux - We can't have some squiggly little researcher, let's make her a PROFESSOR!  WHO KNOWS HOW TO ARMY UP SOME ASSAULT RIFLES! * Hypnosis - HAHAHAHAHA! That is a fancy science word that the normies won't get.  Let's just leave that out altogether. (From the back) How do we fit the word Annihilation into it?     Just have the psychiatrist, Becky, offhandedly belt that spew out.  Apparently, white phosphorus make the big bad alien go away.  The Southern Reach were slobbering windowlickers who didn't think of just sending in a nuke.  Eat a dick, Hollywood.  Seriously, just eat a dick.

2018-03-07T06:36:55,"So promising, but so disappointing  After seeing the trailer and seeing Natalie Portman as the lead actor, and the especial effects, i had high hopes for this film but I ended being disappointed... and I so much wanted this film to succeed.  Annihilation plot is terrible. Total disjointed crap. First, after other expeditions went in, with several groups of military trained men, did not return.. so they decide to send in another, totally inapt and unprepared squad group of 5 women, who are just scientists, to see what was going on.  As much as they say the book was originally written with 4 women as the lead characters, it makes no sense to send these women, who are just scientists, without the military training nor gear and muscle to fight the aliens.. especially no military soldiers that are men are sent either to help them In this expedition aswell. The lesbian character who seems to be the only muscle in the team has more emotional/bipolar breakouts that she herself becomes a menace to the safety and survival of the group of women.. that later on eventually she gets kill easily, what a joke.  BTW as much as people are afraid to admit it. This is movie is part of the feminist propaganda that Hollywood is align to follow and indoctrinate as hard as they can this year.. you will see many more movies that will follow. They tried with the last Ghostbusters, they failed miserably.. yet they will keep on trying again and again, with different tittles and famous actors to bait you into watching and feeding of their ideologies.  it's sad that this agenda is being pushed harder every year.

2018-03-11T09:33:11,"I can't find anyone giving their thoughts on the movie and its meaning, everyone seems pretty confused about it. It's been making me think about it for awhile. Overall it was a great movie. Here's what I think; spoiler warning.   Most people seem to think the point of the movie is about cancer awareness, moreover breast cancer awareness hence the female cast.   That seems to be the most obvious conclusion, but I think it's a bit more than that.  The movie is ambiguous, perhaps it was just for nerds like me talking about it, or there were meanings, or a mixture of the two to get some weird shit that leaves you wondering if you're supposed to be understanding something, it's ambiguous in its ambiguity.   I think it has more to do with morality, perspectives,  and how things don't necessarily have to have objective meaning, but rather that most things are simply relative to one another.  The lighthouse and the strange vortex that created a reflection of the world created bizarre stuff, some things were ""bad"" like the gnarly bear and the huge croc.  Other things were ""good"": beautiful designs, some plants and deer. But at the end of the movie,  she explains to the scientist in the room that her shimmering doppleganger that she created by accident never attacked her, or anything else. It didn't have ""good"" or ""bad"" intentions. It simply reflected her.  It was very different from her, but still the same.  Like how people appear different, but we're really all the same.  We live through different perspectives, but it's all the same shit.  The crazy bear had part ""human"" in it even, and it wasn't trying to do anything ""good"" or ""bad"". It was just doing what it felt natural.  Although, I have to say, the doppleganger was creepier than the bear. I don't blame  Portman for trying to kill it, she didn't know what the hell it was. Fear grips the unknown.  Then there are smaller meanings, like the girl who turned into the tree, perhaps represents people who don't want to go forward or back, they just go along with the ride and accept their fate.  The leader who never had any record of family or loved ones is so focused on getting to her final destination that she never enjoys the ride, but it is still succumbed to death. I'm sure there's more, possibly, but I'd have to rewatch it on DVD to catch anything.  Then I can also figure out at the end, if she swaps bodies or which Portman is the real one, or even if it matters. I think at the end, the point of showing Portman and her husband together, (not the originals but the dopplegangers) was meant to convey that although they are different, they're really the same thing. Some hippie message saying we're all just humans, we're all the same.  The female cast didn't bother me in the slightest, it didn't matter either way, but there were some plotholes. Why did it take them only a few days to get to the lighthouse but every other crew failed so hard? Why did her husbands crew stay a year? How come no one gathered a sample at the edge of the reflection and bring it outside just to study it? They never filled in why they woke up several days later after entering the zone. But, not a big deal.  The origin of the material that created all the reflections doesn't really need an explanation, I mean we don't know the origin beyond the point of the big bang.  It isn't necessary to understand that part.  Maybe just say some unknown material leaked through a rip in a wormhole into this lighthouse.  Whatever.  Interesting movie, cool visuals and atmosphere, good acting and better than something like Black Panther that can entertain someone for 2 hours at most. Been awhile since I had to feel I wanted to watch a movie again and figure out what's going on.  I could be overanalyzing.

They are not easily understood by us, and we are likely confusing for any alien organism (as is shown in the movie, since the alien is just doing its own alien thing and copying human behaviour when encountered.) The fact that the characters ""don't know"" what it wanted, or if it wanted anything at all is great, because likely (perhaps) neither did the alien. Since it was made up of cells everywhere, it was just doing what a cell does - acting on stimuli without being aware of it. Any organism it encountered behaved as the organism normally does (aside from the physical changes the alien brought about).  Put it this way. Humans behave in the way they do. We have no control over the way in which we ""act,"" as in if we control ourselves, that's just our behaviour. Any animal is the same, and while the alien is doing its alien thing, it too is behaving.  So as I'm writing this I've realised that while there is no true human way to interpret the behaviour of the alien organism, the thing all life on Earth shares with it is that it ""behaves.""

They send 5 girls there, yes, not women; Girls. And the best part, these girls except for the protagonist has no combat experience what so ever. Yet they are giving military grade fully automatic assault rifles? WHAT?  So their solution to their highly trained group of soldiers going missing is to send in a team of medical personell and scientists. Absolutely brilliant.   The biologists aren't even using gloves when swapping unidentified specimens. Because contamination has never occurred before, right?   Going back to one part of the first point. One guy returns from the 'shimmer' and he's kept in a quarantine, surrounded by people in hazmat suits. Yet the team that they sent into this 'shimmer' are wearing absolutely no protective gear what so ever. Hmm.   You'd think that this military operation of sorts would have send a squad of highly trained soldiers along with the scientists, right? Better yet, sent in many teams before the scientists even got there, so as to set up secure, highly protected checkpoints with people patrolling the area 24/7. It is very clear that the writers didn't even bother looking into how a situation like this would have been approached at all. It's downright lazy.

Darker than fantasy, less technological than science fiction, weird fiction has contributed to some of the most literary and awarded works in the last twenty years. Writers are often influenced by horror and speculative fiction. Popular weird fiction authors include China Mi√©ville, Neil Gaiman and Jeff VanderMeer. If you are looking for an overview of Weird Fiction and what it is, take a look at Jeff and Ann VanderMeer's exceptional anthology, The Weird. ""  https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/16961.Best_Weird_Fiction_Books  As for those who keep asking why the expedition is all females and why aren't there 50 marines...that's how the book was written and is re-enforced in the film:  ""Annihilation is a 2014 novel by Jeff VanderMeer. It is the first in a series of three books called the Southern Reach Trilogy. The book describes a team of four women (a biologist, an anthropologist, a psychologist, and a surveyor) who set out into an area known as Area X. The area is abandoned and cut off from the rest of civilization. They are the 12th expedition. The other expeditions have been fraught with disappearances, suicides, aggressive cancers, and mental trauma. The novel won the 2014 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 2014 Shirley Jackson Award for best novel.""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_(VanderMeer_novel)  And here are the author and script writer/director of the film:  https://youtu.be/hv74XKAYR2I  And the author speaking by himself:  https://youtu.be/JJI0hmFMjAs  All films are not for all people.

The all-female team must uncover the area‚Äôs monstrous secrets to save Lena‚Äôs husband and the world.  This is another Netflix original movie and another really good film from them . Natalie Portman and Oscar Isaac star and you can see Netflix have not scrimped on the production. This looks absolutely fantastic ( especially in Ultra HD) and the special affects are top notch. This is a cross between Sci Fi and horror and has a really interesting concept. Without giving too much away , inside this Shimmer there are beings that don't just kill any humans that enter , they assimilate with them producing hybred beings. There is one scene with a bear that is really cleverly done. I really liked this. It crosses genres and rarely disappoints.

You secure the zone, and THEN you send the not easily disposable brains to gather the needed data. True the movie wouldn't be as exciting tough...  Personally I'd have mixed them both, and if the all female team was necessary to the plot, I'd find a way to sacrifice the soldiers on the road trying to protect the scientist, then Nathalie would have to motivate the ladies to go on despite the loss. The proof of strength and courage for overcoming the obstacles would be better this way.   But I guess that wouldn't attract as much attention to the project.

No memory of what's happened for days if not a week or more.  The alligator clone still alligators. The cloned deer still deers, the cloned bear still bears.   The cloned team (who thinks they're still human) proceeds with the mission, unaware they're already dead. Their human 'self' though remains and continues to be affected by the Shimmer.... and they slowly go bonkers anyways.  Only Lena and Kane's psyche survives the Shimmer. Probably due to their shared background in the military. Everyone in Kane's squad died, himself included. But his is the only clone we ever see.

But who in their fucking right minds would sendt 5-6 soldiers/scientists whit basic training into a alien enviroment, where highly trained soldiers didnt even make it out from?  I dont really give a F if they send women or males, but atleast make it belivable, send in highly trained soldiers, can be a woman soldier in command or male i dont care, but in this case, they would sendt highly trained soldiers whit the scientists, not retards who break down after a half day, starting to cry and go batshit insane.  What this movie would needed would been 5-6 highly trained soldiers, could been mix of men and females for that sake and 3-5 random scientists.  Sumary of this movie for those who havent seen it yet is this, they send soldiers in first who fail, then they send in some women scientists/soldiers whit basic training, who refuse to watch video evidence the first soldiers left behind, because its to gore, not to mention they refuse to belive the evidence the first soldiers showed them to.  This movie focus mainly on one thing, making women look retarded, incapable of doing anything in a stressfull situation and basicly trying to make women look bad in every aspect, i looked through some comments here and i see alot of men and females bickering women saying (dont like it because its female leads) men saying (it doesnt make sense and why send just women)  people focus to much on who got sendt in, instead of actualy seing how retarded and incapable they made the women in this video look like. To you men who enrage over why its just women in this movie, why do you care? they made them look as dumb and incapable as a dungbeetle. To you women who cheer on crap like this movie just because its female leads, dont you feel ashamed? if these women where men instead, i know i would felth disgusted by the men and how they acted, this movie made the women look so usless and you cheer it on?",0,1,gigggla,89OP78l9oF0,-0.08277370777370777,2018-07-09 13:34:26,False,False

2018-07-25T22:39:10,"Personally, I will give my own opinion. I thought that this movie wasn't good at all. You see, in the beginning, and throughout most of the film, I have no clue what is going on, first she is being interrogated by a man, and then another guy bleeds, like it is a zombie movie or something alike. A lot of the film takes place around a research lab, and later we find out that they built this research building really close to what looks like a force field-esque area of alien origin where life evolves into stronger, more alien creatures. I will give credit where it's due, the suspense of the large bear-like creature sneaking up on them, and making very humanoid sounds, this can be pretty unnerving, and it pretty much does the job.    The film also has a few unnecessary sex scenes, which I don't really care about, one of which, was with a black man, whom we have never been introduced to(At least from what I remember), just to pad out the running time.

2018-07-27T23:33:01,"For everyone who saw it and left the theater confused, it's about cancer. I saw it with my dad and my mind was rocked the whole movie. I went home and googled it, and its about how a cancer cell infects the human body and how people react to it.  The biologist (Natalie Portman) teaches her class in the beginning of the movie about cell division and mutations. This scene correlates with the lighthouse scene being struck by a meteor. Everything is fine until-- BLAM! cancer hits. It expands, spreads, mutates (The Shimmer) and eventually takes over the body (or the Earth). Each character represents a reaction to cancer; Ventress wants to face it, Lena wants to fight it, and others just slip away, such as Radek.  This is just a small similarity.

2018-08-14T03:10:59,"I wrote this synopsis awhile back and decided to update it so...  THIS IS ONE BIG MASSIVE SPOILER AND YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED - WATCH THE FILM FIRST:  PLEASE NOTE: These are not theories or opinions. The following is what is seen on the screen and heard in the dialogue of this film. None of this is derived from the novel (which is quite different) or personal interpretation.   An alien life form falls to earth near a light house in Florida. Park rangers notice a shimmer effect coming from the light house and a warden goes in to investigate and never returns.  That was three years ago‚Ä¶since then The Shimmer has grown in a circular pattern covering land and water and is set to engulf the world.  Attempts have been made to approach by land and sea using drones, animals and teams of people but nothing comes back.  Until now.  A soldier from the last expedition has re-appeared acting strange and suffering from major organ failure.  He shows up at his home where his wife has thought he was dead for a year and they are scooped up by men in black vans while he is being transported to a hospital.  The wife wakes up in a facility and is greeted by a doctor who starts to question her. The wife had met her husband when they both were serving in the military and she had left the service to pursue a career in teaching about the life cycle of the cell. She is taken to see her husband who is there as well.  They are now at a facility known as Area X that stands on the border of The Shimmer (the place that the husband had volunteered to go).  The doctor explains to the wife the timeline of events, of teams going in never to return and the wife later learns that a final volunteer team has been formed from the facility of 4 women who are going into The Shimmer‚Ä¶the team leader is the doctor. The wife volunteers to go in as well (realizing that her husband had volunteered for a suicide mission after he found that the wife had been having an affair with a fellow professor) to search for a way to cure her husband.  Once in The Shimmer all sense of earthly reality is lost. Time-space is altered and no type of signal enters or exits The Shimmer  The alien is ‚Äòrefracting‚Äô (think absorbing and reassembling everything it comes into contact with) everything from DNA to people‚Äôs thoughts, etc. The team discovers they are all being altered genetically while inside The Shimmer.  A journey ensues trying to reach the light house and members of the team begin to be killed or disappear. The Shimmer has sampled as much as possible and finally two of the team members manage to make it to the light house.  Dr. Ventress has been invaded by the alien but the alien literally burns itself out of her body once it realizes she has cancer which could destroy it.  The other surviving member of the team (the one who is married to the soldier who made it out) finds a video recording of the scene where her husband is replaced by a ‚Äòmirror‚Äô or clone of himself. This is the version of the soldier who shows up at their home but as soon as he leaves The Shimmer he begins to die. The alien realizes that it cannot simply duplicate a human and send it out of The Shimmer or it will die even though it has discovered that humans are the apex predator on the planet and are the way for it to embed itself permanently on Earth.  It begins the process of creating a new mirror of the last team member but realizes that what needs to leave The Shimmer is the original of the team member because she is already a hybrid human/alien.  Allowing the original to destroy the ‚Äòmirror‚Äô and subsequently The Shimmer the hybrid now makes its way back to the Area X base and as it approaches the husband ‚Äòmirror‚Äô begins to recover (as the alien / The Shimmer gets closer, now contained within the wife) until it fully recovers.  The end of the film shows them embrace, both exhibiting The Shimmer in their eyes thus confirming that the alien has won and found a way to now complete its conversion of Earth into a living space for itself.  The End.  (There‚Äôs a lot more going on in the film than just this but that is the basic story)",0,0,Conflict Magazine,89OP78l9oF0,-0.003126856803327393,2018-08-14 03:10:59,False,False

2018-08-21T02:53:00,"""The Shimmer"" had a personal effect on me, aside from an alien invasion. To me, ""Annihilation"" represented the countless amount of people, especially children, who are walking into America's national parks & completely disappearing in mysterious & creepy ways. I've been watching documentaries on missing people & the way people went missing in ""Annihilation"" sounded familiar. The setting the 5 women enter happens to be a ""state park"" (spoken by Cass Sheppard), Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) calls it a ""phenomenon"", people are being chosen to walk into the shimmer & someone watches as the shimmer grows quietly, just like the phenomenon in national parks waits quietly for unsuspecting victims & no one on the outside knows how to explain it. When the 5 women enter the shimmer they are forced to deal with missing time, they deal with the loss of coordinates & direction - their compass goes crazy, very similar situations to people missing in national parks. I immediately realized the familiarities & felt they were creepy, I actually thought the national parks phenomenon was the reason behind ""Annihilation"".",0,0,Krypton,89OP78l9oF0,-0.1369047619047619,2018-08-21 02:53:00,False,False

After watching the TRAILER for this movie, I know 100%, without a SINGLE DOUBT, no minuscule doubt, this movie is a farce, a lie, and nothing--absolutely NOTHING like the book. The book is amazing tale of nature and the ways nature can change your mind and evolve on it's own with and without human interaction. The movie just looks like it's trying to be a cool sci-fi thriller with no care for the intense care that Jeff Vandermeer put into the plot and overall story-telling of the book. And if you think I'm lying: within the first 10 pages of the book you are introduced to the tower. And within the first ten pages of the book you are told that they have no names, and that there are only four of them on the expedition. She knew very well that her husband went into Area X--which it's called Area X by the way, not the fucking ""shimmer"". I just am appalled and upset at the outright blasphemy they choose to put into a trailer, when you call it a best-selling novel and don't even have the audacity to ACKNOWLEDGE ANY of the plot points in the book.

The 1077th is known for their fierce interception of the German 16th Panzer Division.   On August 23rd 1942, the German 16th were tasked with destroying the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, which had been refitted to manufacture tanks. The attack came from the northern quarter of the city and as the Soviets were not expecting an attack from this quarter, the 1077th were completely unprotected by infantry.   Armed with only thirty seven M1939 Air Defense Guns and facing an onslaught of German tanks, they did the only thing they could, improvise and fight.   They dropped their anti-aircraft guns to the lowest elevation and fired out across German tanks and submachine-gunners, for two days they fought before finally being overwhelmed by the sheer number of Germans.    The 1077th were no more but not before destroying 83 tanks, 15 infantry vehicles, killing 3 battalions of infantry and shooting down 14 aircraft. The German‚Äôs had yet to know it but the resistance put up by the 1077th would be a sign of things to come.   The Germans, arriving at the positions they had been receiving such intense fire from were shocked to find the bodies of young women. This regiment like many other anti-aircraft regiments in the Soviet Union at the time was made up entirely of young women, some of them not long out of high school.

2019-01-25T11:44:57,"What utter horse shit. I'll say this: The movie created a creepy atmosphere with great special effects (mostly, some shots were obviously paintings not actual props/sets. Very nice paintings, granted) but it wasn't nearly schlocky enough to save this dumpster fire. Really good visual storytelling, which is refreshing. There were a few REALLY good scenes, like the bear scene, but as soon as I turned my brain on or I remembered how much I hated the characters it deflated everything for me. The characters are intolerable, especially the chubby loudmouth Latina cunt. I was overjoyed when she got her head ripped open. I was yelling at the screen the whole time because they constantly made stupid decisions yet they're supposed to be a bunch of brilliant scientists.  Right off the bat bullshit coincidences pile up fast. ""I did 7 years in the army AND I'm a super-duper biologist AND with a special covert ops husband!"" Did a high school football player write this? Lets see that's 6-8 years for school and 7 years military...How fucking old is she supposed to be? Then they make camp in an army watch tower, and the one keeping watch is down on the ground 50 metres away...WTF ARE YOU RETARDED? Maybe sit on the roof of the thing, or patrol the outer walkway at the top of the tower? NOPE, we need a stupid excuse for someone to die and to introduce the bear (best part of the movie). They try to make these sympathetic characters but then we find out Natalie Portman has been cheating on her husband for who knows how fucking long. Oh yeah, I totally get it... wait no, I don't, WHAT WHORE WROTE THIS? And this is after it cuts away from the cool alien shit constantly to show Portman and Isaacs relationship in flashbacks. Only to make me wish they were all dead by finding out she's a cheating whore. I don't need ANY Hollywood bimbos (Isaacs included) rolling around in bed in a sci fi movie. Alien had ONE SCENE of Ripley in her underwear and she was getting ready for cryo stasis or whatever. Sigourney Weaver was 10x hotter in that than Portmans wiry, flat, midget self. After reading some comments I was reminded that they said nobody was volunteering anymore...ugghh. You are the MILITARY. You order people to their deaths pretty regularly as is, and you believe this is a threat to the planet... FUCKING ORDER SOME SOLDIERS TO GET IN THERE! If they don't listen you can throw em in the brig! Not to mention the fact that human curiosity is insanely strong and people would still be lining up for the opportunity. Any scientist worth their salt would be FOAMING AT THE MOUTH TO GET IN THERE. Do you think the first people crossing the Atlantic had any guarantees? FUCK NO. That shit is for pussies, humans have more guts than that and a willingness to self-sacrifice for the greater good I think is a lot more common than this movie would suggest.",2,4,eatshitdie1,89OP78l9oF0,0.08843546708300806,2019-01-25 11:44:57,False,False

2019-02-23T06:31:57,"Welcome to the one year release anniversary of the best film of 2018 (my favorite- YMMV).  It's been an interesting year since this film was released by a studio scared to death that the movie was 'to smart' for the average film viewer and I hate to admit it but I think they were right.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand this film but I don't think it's the film itself but our current political and social environment that is the worst part of the situation.  A perfect example would be if the film 'Aliens' were released today. Now everyone asked will tell you that Aliens is the best film in the franchise (I disagree but that's for another time).  But look at how films with lead female characters are being reacted to today and then think about the story of Aliens: A bunch of gung-ho space marines go to a planet along with a civilian female freighter pilot and manage to get their asses handed to them while being reminded that a LITTLE GIRL has survived the alien attack on her own while space marines are cracking up and crying...now wouldn't that movie be a big hit today? I can see it now...just read the asinine comments on this trailer and you can probably get a pretty good idea what kind of reception it would receive.  Well, I have TL;DR'ed this post but I would like to take a moment to thank those who could hold a civil conversation on the subject here but most of all I would like to thank the trolls who helped keep this trailer trending up for a year. Without your noise this film would have suffered...instead you have made this film even more popular than it was to start with. You've gotten people to see the trailer and take a chance on the film...and that is a good thing.  Blade Runner was considered a disaster when it was released just like 2001 was called crap...but time changed a lot of minds on those films and I have no doubt that in the future when the list of great SF films are listed Annihilation will take its place at the table as an honored guest.  Here's to the next great SF film, whatever it might be, and to the creators who fight to keep SF a viable genre for fans around the world.  I'll leave you with  links to the UK reviewer Mark Kermode's videos on the film:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcnr6y6yqII  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPHmaKzQ5u0  I don't always agree with him but I have followed him ever since his documentary 'On the Edge of Blade Runner' (which didn't appear on any of the the Final Cut  editions).  If you are on the fence about seeing this film all I can say is after 100+ viewings it is still one of my favorite films of all time (and that is a long time and a lot of films) and I hope you find your way through The Shimmer and find your own reasons for loving this film.  -30-",1,1,Conflict Magazine,89OP78l9oF0,0.2757675438596491,2019-02-23 06:31:57,False,False

Yes there is females in the military but a small amount and no offense but if it's this could be the end of the world why sent people who definitely dont have qualification to do the mission.( not sure about the other 3 girls but through out the triler i see that they dont even cheek out the house they want to camp in the girl shows her back in an unsearched house definitely looking to die also that girl never thought about how a swamp could have wild animals like wtf also the other girl wasted bullets for no reason we also have girls panicing left and right they dont look anything like someone who can handle this mission. Also the main character or any other girl couls kill whatever that creature was when it only showed its head out of the door frame you just need few shoots if you want to do it silently use a knife.

However, if you have 50 explosions, tons of CGI and a mindless plot with ceramic actors who have muscular bodies...well, that is what people want and that is what they WANT us to want!!! Destroys the mind, makes us literally drones and the brainwashing continues lol. Serious, do you ever notice that the really intelligent films, with great dialogue and story, just get banished or denied funding and if they get made at all it is on a very small budget and sadly, most people don't want to watch a film with ""a bunch of talking"" lol, that is the state of the U.S and most of the world these days. Scary, but I think that 2001 A Space Odyssey would not even earn a blip today, it would end up much like this film, not comparing this to 2001 as Kubrick is untouchable, however, both films try to make the viewer use his/her mind to figure things out.

Just when I was ready to write off films in favor of other forms of viewing material I found this film and was fortunate enough to see it in theater over 20 times.  When the pre-order became available I didn't hesitate. This was a film I wanted to study at length. It has been the source of controversy the same way Blade Runner was when it was released and I have no doubt that this film will continue to find its fans, all the while standing up to the test of time. It has already made most of the 'Greatest SF Films Of All Time' lists and is moving more towards the top of those lists with each passing month.  I will let the likes/dislikes numbers at the top tell you how many people have enjoyed this film percentage-wise. If you like SF films like Moon, Arrival, Upstream Color, Solaris, Stalker, etc. then this may be a film for you.  This is not a social or political agenda film. I have no interest in being preached to while trying to watch something that is supposed to be entertainment and I avoid those films and series like the plague. I would never recommend such a film to anyone under any circumstances.  This is a great film and it is my hope that people continue to watch it for themselves and draw their own conclusions.
