Whenever american movies or shows have a mexican or latino setting, they tend to rely a lot on jokes based on stereotypes, like people with bad english and mexican accent, or random spanish words in the middle of sentences.  And it's not because I find that offensive or anything (although I can see people getting offended by it), but because all of these jokes simply don't work in spanish.  When this movie gets dubbed in spanish, How this jokes are supposed to work when the punchline is someone saying something in spanish?  That's the reason I didn't like shows like Mucha Lucha or El Tigre, a  lot of the humor doesn't make sense in spanish.

According to the clothing of the characters I see there is a strong Spanish influence, I think the time where the film is in Mexico the 17th or 19th century unfolds. Accordingly I must remind you that the tradition of the spirit world, deities and humans is governed from the center of everything (in fact mentions the teacher to explain what the book of life, which I think is the Popol Vuh of the Maya or Nahuatl tlalticpac universe) and for those who will see the film consider the traditions of Day of the Dead is not from Hispanic Mexico, is from prehispanic Mexico.

2014-09-09T18:30:40,"WHen i first heard of this film I was expecting something pretty terrible. Now after seeing this trailer it just looks okay. I will be completely honest that my biggest shame is that nearly every film centered on Latinos I have seen, American made and abroad, in recent years has been pretty bad. Like the comedies are often sappy and sentimental and are needlessly quirky and silly half the time. And what people make in America is often so filled with cultural references that all of the character feel like stereotypes and the entertaining kind like Tuco from The Good the Bad and The Ugly. And so often these movies (the American kind) force in a political agenda or a cultural message that it is impossible to enjoy what I am watching. And this coming from a guy who is otherwise a big supporter of these kind of things. What I really want is just a normal film starring Latinos that does not try to make a message and is entirely in English. Basically I just want the same approach white people use when making films for films starring other white people. That means never announcing they are white and just allow them to be characters going through a story that is never defined by their race. ",0,0,Alberto Romero,NBw5YScs8iQ,0.04031531531531531,2014-09-09 18:30:40,True,True

2016-03-16T06:10:24,"I love this movie, it's a breath of fresh air to see original designs rather than the skin textures we see in dreamworks and Disney. BUT, there's two problems with this movie, one of them is the songs, the way they put modern pop songs with Mexican music is very distracting. If I want to make movie about ""The day of the Dead"" which is a real tradition in Mexico, I would put traditional Mexican songs that way the audience feels like they're part of this tradition, but hearing Creep by radio head and Just a friend by Biz Markie is very distracting and seems out of place in this movie. I wish it had more songs similar to the bull scene. My second problem is how the movie is a tad too predictable, honestly we all knew who Maria was gonna end up with and who was gonna win this bet, it's really obvious, it's also cliche, ""The guy with the pure heart wins the girl of his dreams over the other guy with brawn.""",1,0,Ali3ngazer,NBw5YScs8iQ,0.18401360544217685,2016-03-16 06:10:24,False,False
