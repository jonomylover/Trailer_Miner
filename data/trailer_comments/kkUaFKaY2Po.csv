2016-08-22T00:44:30,"Mr. Denzel Washington maybe one of the greatest actors of our generation. And while I look forward to seeing this movie and his sequel to ""The Punisher"" I also worry that this great actor is also no longer using his immense talents to put out serious fare worthy of his skills. I would like to see more dramatic real historical roles like his early work in ""Glory"" which won him his first Oscar in a supporting acting role and whose whipping scene will forever stand out as one of the most powerful clips on cinematic history. I know that Hollywood works on its own sets of rules for making a film but if there is anyone that can listen and with the power to make this happen I wish Mr. Washington could make a movie of a real Black American Hero that has been totally forgotten by time. He is known as ""The Black Death"" and belonged to the Harlem Hell Fighters. He was a WW1 fighter named William Henry Johnson and what he did would have been told consistently in the history books if he were white. Serving with the French Fighters during World War 1 ""because America wouldn't like Black fighters fight along side white men"" he fought on the front lines against German fighters. One fateful night while on guard duty with a friend, his position was attacked by German troops in an effort to launch a surprise attack. Mr. Johnson in an effort to protect his position and to save his injured friend from capture took on scores of armed German troops with a rifle, then a hand gun, then a bayonet then his bare hands. In the end, even after being shot in the head and torso several times he killed 5 German troops and wounded 20 more. He not only saved his wounded soldier buddy but prevented a surprise attack which would have meant the death of scores of fellow solders. How was this brave soldier repaid when he came back to the states? He was fired from his train porters job because his injury's made it difficult to move and denied a military pension or benefits because he was black. He died penniless and in a debtor cemetery before he was 30. Just recently in 1996 did his receive the Distinguished Service Cross. Pretty poor for a man that at the time Former President Theodore Roosevelt called one of the ‚Äúfive bravest Americans‚Äù to serve in World War I. If there ever was a person that should have a movie made about his life and service its Mr. Johnson and if the every was an actor worthy of making a movie about this brave American then it would be Mr. Washington.
