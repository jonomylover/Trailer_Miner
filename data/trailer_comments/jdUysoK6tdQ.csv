The reason why the Warrens kept the doll was because it could cause harm to people. I read that it was locked in their basement. The doll, being locked would appear through the Warren's home on several occasional. I also read that they don't advise anyone to stare at the doll.

2014-07-22T00:58:25,"Ok this is kind of long but interesting, supposed to  be the real story..   Although the opening sequence to The Conjuring claims it took place in 1968, the documented case occurred in the summer of 1970, when a mother purchased an antique Raggedy Ann doll from a hobby store. The doll was meant as a birthday gift to her daughter, Donna, a nursing student who resided with a room-mate named Angie in a small apartment. Happy with her gift, Donna placed the doll on her bed and didn’t give much thought to it until the pair started to notice strange things concerning the doll. It appeared to move around and switch positions, crossing and uncrossing it’s legs and arms when no one was around. As time passed, the occurrences became more common and increasingly bold. The girls would come home to find the doll in a completely different room than it was left in. Sometimes they would find it standing upright in the kitchen, or with it’s legs crossed on the couch, awaiting their return. Donna began placing the doll face down on the couch before leaving for her studies, only to return to find it back in her room on the bed with the door closed. After about a month of these strange happenings Donna and Angie began to find cryptic messages, in pencil on parchment paper, by what looked to be the hand-writing of a small child. The messages said “Help us” and “Help Lou”. The Lou in question was a friend of the roomies, and not a fan of Donna’s creepy doll. He urged her several times to get rid of the doll, but as it was a gift from her mother, Donna wanted to keep it because of her sentimental attachment. One night Donna came home to find that the doll had moved again, and this time it was covered in what appeared to be blood. Feeling more frightened than ever, the girls contacted a medium and held a seance. The medium claimed to have picked up the story of “Annabelle”, a young girl who had lived and died on the property years previous, before the apartments had even been built. The medium told the girls that the spirit of the young girl had found comfort with them, and wanted only to live among them and be loved. Convinced by the sad story of the young girl who had left the earthly plane too soon, the girls then invited “Annabelle” to inhabit the doll and stay with them. Which turned out to not be such a great idea…  Their friend Lou was the victim of the first physical manifestation of what the girls had unwittingly invited into their home. One night while awakened from a deep sleep, Lou found himself unable to move in the bed. He claims that the doll was in the bed with him and slowly moved up his body and began to strangle him with it’s little doll hands, while he was paralyzed. His friends dismissed it as a dream, but Lou was convinced that something evil was lurking within the doll, and on another night his suspicions were confirmed. Lou and Angie were alone in the apartment, making plans for a rod trip the next day when they heard a rustling noise coming from Donna’s room. Lou found the room empty of intruders, but spied the doll tossed on the floor in the corner. He made his way to the doll, and had a distinct feeling that someone was behind him. He turned around to see no one there, but a moment later he claims that his chest was slashed by seven claw marks, three vertically and four horizontally. The cuts were burning and bleeding, but reportedly healed fully within the next two days. At this point, the students were put in contact with the Warrens, who quickly took an interest in the case. As portrayed in The Conjuring, Ed and Lorraine Warren quickly concluded that the doll was not “possessed”, but rather being manipulated by a demonic presence. The Warrens had an exorcism performed at the apartment, and agreed to take the doll into custody as it were, and have imprisoned the suspected conduit in a glass case for the past decades.",0,0,hulda494,jdUysoK6tdQ,0.04248380026681915,2014-07-22 00:58:25,True,True

So when Lou got claw marks from the attack, roommate, Angie was there and actually saw his injury-- 3 horizontal claw marks and 4 vertical marks. Also, The TRUTH fact is, the film makers most likely made this ""Annabelle"" a Ventriloquist's doll, because logically a ""Rag doll"" has No hollow inside. Being 'stuffed' with material Leaves no room for any Spirit, or demon to ""Move into"" an already full rag stuffed inside.

As a matter of fact, youtube's put this shitty trailer in front of every video I wanted to watch for the past two weeks now, and I can't skip it. Which means, I've spent the better part of two hours watching a horrible trailer to an abysmal movie over and over again.  I have no idea if this's just happened to me. But if this happened to other people as well, I can just say that this is the worst marketing strategy anyone can come up with, because I personally am at that point now where I hate every character, every plot twist and childish jump scare in this trailer so much that I wish I could travel back in time and prevent this movie from ever being made. My second point is; it doesn't even seem like a  decent movie. What kind of good movie would need to insult people on youtube over and over again with its gut-wrenchingly awful trailer? Right. None.

The scenes are so predictable, like fr I felt like I've seen this movie before perhaps back in 2012/2013 that's why I came here to check if it's the right new movie(2014). No terror and the doll isn't actually the main character, if someone watched the movie without being told that Annabelle is the main character , he wouldn't guess it is. I mean I spent a whole hour watching it without any special appearance of the doll  just some demonic stuff hunting Mia and her baby! Like god we're used to things like that! I mean perhaps if the doll moved or had some facial expressions like anger for example the movie would be a lot better and scarier. I won't say I wasted my time but I don't think right now I'm terrified especially that I'm used to horror movies. Anyways if you guy wanna watch a really scary movie you should check "" DEAD SILENCE"" 2007! I had nightmares tbh after watching it at midnight, home alone!
