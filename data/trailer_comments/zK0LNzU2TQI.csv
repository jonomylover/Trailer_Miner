2019-02-07T15:33:22,I'm okay with changes being made. I understand its a re-adaptation and not everything can or should always stay the same but changing the death of Gage to Ellie is disappointing. The shock and devastation of losing a child SO young is vital to the characters motivations in the source material. Ellie is also old enough to understand that her brother is dead and her family is being torn apart and that is part of the horror. I'll still watch and give it a chance but man... can't hide my disappointment about this change.,33,8,sisterofeluria,zK0LNzU2TQI,-0.06666666666666667,2019-02-07 15:33:22,True,True

Not sure how I feel about the changes from the source material.  It isn't even the same story anymore after this trailer.  This is what I gleaned from this trailer.  Pros (so far): - Wendigo plot element is here, though perhaps a little too much so.  We'll have to wait and see on that. - Casting (I guess.  I mean they'll never replace or outdo Fred Gwynne, but I can accept the prolific John Lithgow.) - Church looks gnarly.  Cons/Other: - Oh, everything else. - It doesn't necessarily look like Maine.  The characters now live in cabins in the woods it seems, going for a blatant, forced, easy creep factor instead of the alluring surprise of these events happening in a quiet New England neighborhood. - Changing the climactic demon child to Ellie is a bad idea, given the part she plays in the actual story/novel.  Should've been kept as Gage.  Now it's the girl from 'The Ring' LOL - Judging from all the changes, it also looks like there will be no sign or involvement of Rachel's parents beyond maybe the Zelda stuff, seen spoiled here in the trailer. - Apparently, the kids from 'Sinister' and 'Frank' from 'Donnie Darko' are here, so there's that. - There was never anything creepily ritualistic about the actual Pet Sematary that the children built, just the Wendigo-possessed Micmac Indian burial ground beyond. - The Micmac grounds seemingly being a swamp now (the shot was too quick to get a good detailed look, but it looked like a swamp) lends a little bit of a creep factor to it all, however, there was just something so deeply disturbing about the dry, frozen ground and wide-open rock formations of the original story.

2019-02-08T00:17:53,"Dear precious friend, please know that Jesus Christ provides the strength we need to persevere and grow. Growing in the life of a believer can sometimes be difficult, but when we persevere with Christ, barriers are surmountable. Our circumstances may be unfavorable and discouragement may seem like an obstacle. Yet if we press on in our relationship with the Lord, we can flourish in every aspect of our lives.                 This was the experience of the apostle Paul. Despite the severe hardships and challenges he faced (2 Corinthians 11 : 23‚Äì27), he wouldn‚Äôt give up. ‚ÄúI . . . take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI press on toward the goal to win the prize‚Äù (Philippians 3 : 12, 14).  Paul realized he could do all things through the Lord who strengthened him (4 : 13), and so can we as we press on with the help of One who gives us strength.                    Make ""I trust you Jesus"" the response to everything you think, say and do in your life. Having complete trust in Jesus will strengthen you and fortify you against everything you will face in your life's journey. How comforting to know that we are NEVER alone and our Lord always have been and will always be with us.                                        Like Paul, press on towards the goal to win the prize by acknowledging you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Yeshua (Jesus Christ) into your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be sealed and justified in salvation. You will be blessed abundantly and your life will be forever changed!                    Dear one, may your spirit be filled with joy and assurance in praying the following prayer with me.... Dear Heavenly Father, this is a day that You have made. Thank You that You‚Äôll be near me in whatever I face today and everyday of my life. Help me to trust You with every single aspect of my life, no matter how big or small. This I pray in the Mighty Mighty name of Your only begotten Son Jesus the Christ, Amen!

2019-02-08T07:57:16,"my problem with this trailer, isn't so much that they gave everything away (which they did) its the fact they took everything great about the book/ movie away! im sure they figured ""oh let's make the older kid die because no one wants to see a baby die""  look I wouldn't want to see any child of any age die in a movie, that's number one! but that was what made the book and movie that much more horrifying, shocking and devasting! was that it was a baby who dies!! and it was his sister's fault! (in a way, more so the negligent parent's fault) but anyway it was Ellie who had the visions and psychic connection with Pascow! which enabled her to warn her mother, how is a seemingly babbling baby going to convey that to his mother now that its Ellie who dies and not him??? oh, wait..üôÑ and now the trailer shows that Rachel sees Ellie with Louis, so that also means there won't be all these things preventing her from getting home! like in the original where Ellie was the one who warned her! and it also looks like Ellie is going to be like a pet kept in the basement who breaks free to kill judü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I bet she will kill Louis as well since its child swapped why not be parent swapped too? *sigh* this shouldn't be called an adaption or a remake this is an entirely different movie with the same plot points, but a definitely a different movie, shame...ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",0,0,Jalissa R-D,zK0LNzU2TQI,0.16904761904761906,2019-02-08 07:57:16,True,True

2019-02-08T15:04:54,"ourforgiveness.c*o*m  ""End Times"" Friends, harken unto my words. Bible prophesies are being fulfilled, the early birth pains are on the rise ""For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these¬†are¬†the beginning of sorrows.‚Äù¬†(Matthew 24:7-8). Christianity is being suppressed worldwide by the increasing number of new laws that oppose conservative christian values; by self-deceived philosophers who make no mention of Christ as the means for salvation; and by New Age propaganda such as: spirituality, consciousness, chakras, meditation, enlightment, law of attraction, scientology, and prosperity preaching. ""Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves"" (Matthew 7:15). ""And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light"" (2 Corinthians 11:14); a liar, and a murderer. Be not deceived, ""Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them"" (Matthew 7:20). For the Lord has said "" My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:¬†And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand"" (John 10:27-28). I encourage you friends to do some basic research, and you will see that a cashless society is at the horizon. And the microchipping of humans is already here, and sooner than later the following words shall come to pass ""And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name"" (Revelation 13:16-17). Ask yourself how much do you love money, ""For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows"" (1 Timothy 6:10). Now, who among you seeks after power and fame?, ""For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?""(Mark 8:36). Time to wake up friends, the world is not going to get any better, even if religious leaders try to unify and coexist; for Jesus said ""Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword"" (Matthew 10:34), meaning, He came to separate the believers from the non believers. He also said, ""...I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (John 14:6). Jesus is the the ONLY way to Heaven brothers, all other religions are false and will not save you from eternal fire, for what communion does Jesus have with Allah, or what righteousness is there in Shiva or Belial? Nay', Isay. ‚ÄúNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.‚Äù¬†(Acts 4:12). Do not get complacent friend, but rather, examine yourself and see what is causing you to love the world, for it is written: ""Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.¬†For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world"" (1 John 2:15-1). Your life, my beloved, is but a mist ""Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away"" (James 4:14). Therefore, do not waste any more time with foolishness. Some of you have children, think about their souls, think about the hard times to come. Awaken my brothers, and let the Almighty God redeem your soul, arise from the shadows of darkness and sing to the LORD, be not ashame of righteousness, justice, and holiness. Strive ye to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Behold!, now is the time of grace, Now is the time salvation, Take it! while it is still offered.    To the believer: ""Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."" (2 Timothy 2:15). And remember to pray for the lost souls, even as satan uses them to oppress and persecute us, ""For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.""(Ephesians6:12). Our commission, brethren, is to preach the Gospel of Christ. And let us also bring hope and comfort to the weak and destitute. Be wise therefore how you present the Gospel to different types of people, and do not compromise your purity.   To the spiritually lost: Turn to God and ""If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."" (1 John 1:9). And ""...if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."" (Romans 10:9) ""For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."" (Luke 11:10)  read the New Testament. ***  All glory be to the Most High God.",0,0,ourforgiveness *com,zK0LNzU2TQI,0.1294671214202464,2019-02-08 15:04:54,True,True

2019-02-08T20:10:08,Wow they gave away too much in this Trailer but i seen the older movie and read some of the book so I kinda know how this will play out LOL. I do wish they kept the reveal with Ellie Dying instead of Gage a secret tho what a shock it would had been with everybody in Movie Theaters that read the book and seen the 1989 movie with that big twist inspecting Gage to die thats such a missed opportunity on them but then again it mite get spoiled on the Internet like everything else does they wanted to tell us first I guess.  The little girl actress will make or brake this Remake with her acting can she pull off the creepyness and have good acting like some of the other Evil kid characters in other Horror Movies will see if not the movie critics and fans will bash her delivery but I got faith in her because they audition thousands of little girls for this role i know they picked the best actress so i have faith in the writers and producers of this Remake.,0,0,j - levine,zK0LNzU2TQI,0.07009803921568628,2019-02-08 20:10:08,True,True

Creepy kids who wears masks? Markings on trees as warnings? I am -this- close to putting it on the 'Only same title as the book' category along with Percy Jackson and I, Robot.   I get that it's a movie adaptation and changes will be made but c'mon, changing almost everything? Gage's death was the tipping point that pushed Louis' rationality. Sure he loved Ellie but it was obvious in the book (aka, source material) that Louis and Gage had a special bond. It would have been great if it was a hard cut of different scenes and end the trailer with a kite flying in the air with a little boy laughing. Remove those creepy kids who were rejected from the Purge movie, stay true to the very plot, and show a bit of bond between Judd and Louis.

Yes I I agree that they showed a little too much but you can't not advertise the fact that the kid dies and then comes back you know that is kind of sort of a selling point of the story. Same with the undead cat. And again we are missing a lot of key context here we are getting bullet points bullet points bullet points bullet points nothing else but bullet points you show too little it won't be as good; now I will say that I think that this is a pretty poorly implemented trailer the editing itself is good but it's practically nothing but trailer fodder lines feels very phoned-in comes off as very melodramatic it could have been just 2 minutes long you could have shown all the same Clips Maybe but with less dialogue. One thing I would definitely have preferred is more of the funeral but damn those were some nice shots it is a very pretty looking film The Atmosphere conveyed in this trailer is thick as a log and I liked it come on guys let's grow up,0,0,Christian Schmude,zK0LNzU2TQI,0.12999999999999998,2019-02-09 03:14:49,True,True

Seriously, its like they took an industrial buffer to all aspects of the production design to remove as much burr as possible.  A BIG part of why I hold the '89 film in such high esteem is that it felt as grimy and real as raising kids in an old Northeast house can be.  I could relate more to that setting in all its drab accuracy then I ever could to a bunch of carefully lit tree glyphs that look to be lifted straight from Halloweentown.

Ellie can really take on that character the way it was originally  written.  I think the actress is the same age as Linda blair was when she did the exorcist.  Have an open mind.

2019-02-12T01:41:40,SPOILERS Seeing some tweaks already that I don‚Äôt like. Why would they switch the roles of Gage and Ellie? Why would they reveal so much about the movie already and include massive spoilers like that? Considering how much they‚Äôve revealed it seems like Ellie‚Äôs gonna die early on in the movie and the rest of the movie she‚Äôll be haunting them. I‚Äôm not a big fan of this. There was something about the pacing of the book where there were certain story beats and the story slowly unfolded and was laid out so well that you could see where it was headed yet you could only watch as things went to hell. It was extremely driven by it‚Äôs themes.

Paramount even requested twins but Miko pulled it off alone. Yes if u watch the documentary they had their difficult moments getting him to do things.  They said he even flipped out on the scene where he tore Juds throat out.  When Jud started convulsing after that then died they said Miko freaked out thinkin he did somethin to him and didnt understand.  They had to calm Miko down and luckily his parents were on set at all times to comfort him as well.  And with using a doll for the original Gage...  Yes but come on guys.  Give Miko credit ...they used the doll for ONE scene.  The part he ""jumped"" from attic onto Louis and the fight with Louis. and the part where he was set on fire.  So come on.. all those other scenes?  Was Miko himself!!.  So i think he did a damn good job. For being a 2 yr old!! They said they made it be like a game to him. And im sure Miko Hughes is not messed up from playing that part..he prob of course dont even remember it being so young.   I mean this is why Gage Creed is a classic!!

He loved trucks which is why he ran out onto the road. And they don't ""try"" to live with him dead, the Dad loses his mind and digs him up. The mother had no clue until she arrived home and he came at her all sweet but he killed her and it's like she wouldn't defend herself because he's her baby. Ellie was the one who foresaw that her dad was gonna dig up the brother. And the relationships between the characters were so good in the first movie. Gage was such a cheeky little boy, throwing food at his sister and shushing his mom. The dad had such a great relationship with Judd because he was the father figure he never had. In order for a horror movie to work cheap scares like this one is not the answer. Making us care about the characters and even relating to them is the answer.

Because you know the corpse of your dead child reanimated and trying to kill you somehow isn't scary enough so let's throw in some out of nowhere kids in masks to flood the movie and basically act and cheap jump scare fodder.  Ergh, I kind of hope this is a fake trailer. Like its a deliberate misdirect and this is all fake footage to make Gage's death more 'shocking' as it stands they've replaced Gage Creed with a generic creepy girl, turned it from one terrifying night into a long drawn out haunted house and they've drawn the focus away from the horror of what can happen if you let grief overcome common sense for the sake of a bunch of jump scare 'creepy kids in masks' who have no personal attachment to Louis or Rachel so there's NO REASON TO CARE beyond cheap jumpscares.  Pet sematary was a dark, personal and very subtle story. If you didn't have the courage to deal with the heavy themes from that book you shouldn't have tried to adapt it. A few changes and updates are fine but you know what 'It' may have changed a few details from the book and 1990 miniseries but at least the basic plot remains the same.

I read the book and Ellie never even thinks about going alone in the pet sematary. Second of all Gage dies not Ellie. Not a birthday party but a thanksgiving party.  And what the fuck is with the children in masks, Stephen doesn't even mention anything about them. Gage(not Ellie) comes back to life while Rachel is on her way from Chicago and she never brings Ellie along, she left her with her grandparents. I don't think Gage had the same voice but it should change anyway and everyone, but Louis, gets killed in Jud's house while he gets tripped up by church and Gage(actually a demon) tells him what a whore Norma was. Then Rachel finally arrives and goes upstairs to Jud's house because she is worried and gets killed by Gage DURING THE MORNING not the evening while she sleeps. Anyway, Louis was still sleeping at that moment but when he went downstairs Rachel's dad called as he was worried and Louis got what happened. He got some morphine injections and killed church as he was outside then went upstairs and killed him with 3 injections(if I remember right). He then proceeds to burn down the house. One more thing WHERE THE FUCK IS STEVE. As I was saying Steve comes by as he is worried and sees the house burning. He then looks for Louis and finds him at the back of his house going to the pet sematary. He sees him with a body while Louis was climbing the deadfall. Steve climbs but then slips and goes back thinking Louis went mad. And he actually did.

Despite her warnings her father continues down his path of destruction and she tries to warn her mother after her father buries her brother not to go back and yet mom dose and is killed buy her own son.  this movie looks horrible, i urge all, please read the book, this movie just looks like a mess to me, as a devoted Stephen King fan, he has said himself, the true story is the book not the movie, so please read the book or listen to it unabridged on audio, but, as much as i love John as an actor, this just looks horrible to me. Seriously, cultish kids is so lame, in the book much scarier  as it progresses.  In essence, this book is sort of a twist retelling of frankenstein, in that the father whom is a doctor cannot give up his attachment or see that ends are natural and fine, and goes down an unnatural path, twist a human into a monster cause of his in ability to give up that which he loves.   While I know king could care less, as a constant reader, i'll be re-reading the book and skipping this over priced trash of an adaptation, i just don't know why hollywood has to take a good story that is all there, and the book needs no addition, and just doesn't adapted it wisely. I get it cannot go page by page, but when they start adding and removing as though they read the book and create a false untrue adaptation people aren't going to read then get false sense of the power of the story or the content of the story, please stop doing this hollywood.  But will say glad your doing the wendigo at least, but as for the daughter she doesn't die but if her father kills her mother and maybe possessed mother kills him at the end, in the book something i never thought of, but a friend said, so what do you think happens to the girl, if she comes back to the home...well i'll let you draw your own conclusions, but I think thats more scary cause yah the one innocent child your left going oh, now whats her fate. Also, i don't remember there being markers in the book, i think what to me was more scary was in the book that the presence that wants a human to possess works, lures, Judd against his own better insight, and in the end he realizes it before its two late cause at one point he sampled the forbidden by bring back his dog.   Personally, my favorite book by King is IT, but his scariest to me is Pet Sematary, again please please please, don't spend your hard earned money on this, read or listen to the book, use your imagination and enjoy the true story as it should be.

If it's based on the novel, the producers usually change elements to make it something new that we haven't seen before and in a lot of cases like this the films can end up doing brilliant by bringing something new to the table (Keep in mind that Pet cemetery has already had one film, and I'm assuming that a lot of us have read and or watched the first film/book.)

2019-03-12T16:25:37,"as someone whos read the book and loved the first movie, this thing is going to be terrible. theyve shown in their trailer that they have removed everything that made the original film truly frightening and replaced it with a bunch of cliches. Zelda, in the film, was played my a man, in order to give it a physically warped and psychologically disturbing feel. and it worked. it worked so well, they used the same tactic in the film, The Ring, with Samara, with similar results. But now, theyre acting like thats an amateur approach. So, they just cast a little girl and its not going to feel like anything else but a little girl. its going to be sad, not bone chilling... They opted for some pretty cat, made to look menacing with cgi, insted of using a real cat that looks and sounds menacing on its own. They wanted a pretty cat. this already tells me they are relying on looks and cgi to carry the film, and ignoring what makes the book and film truly scary, the realism and depth... Using Ellie as the child Louis loses, insted of Gage, well, come on, how gut wrenching was it to see a toddler die by running out into the road, chasing a kite? theres no way using Ellie is going to lend more to the emotional power of the story. That moment in the original film haunted people for a lifetime. They wanted to use Ellie, so they could give the dead child more depth and more to do, well, thats just lazy filmaking. because you dont need to add more PLOT to a BOOK with plot to spare. And it was the subtlety that made Gage so scary. He was not that mobile, but his parents grief caused them to welcome the little zombie into their arms without fear of consequences. thats the point of the book. thats the point of the whole story. how disarmed a grieving parent becomes to logic and danger, in the midst of their bereavement. i cringe at the thought of what they want to make of Ellies character. i just know its going to be garbage... People keep mentioning ""the wendigo"", like we are going to get to see the wendigo, well, the wendigo is not a central theme of the book. the book does not make the wendigo a character, it is a passing reference to mythology. and barely focused on to any substantial degree with concern for the plot. im like, this story does not NEED a MONSTER to make it scary or carry out its design. it is scary enough as it is. and how could they even have enough film time to add more story or plot elements? the problem with adapting books to film is you have too much story and not enough screen time. so what are they thinking? seriously?.... and the fact that they are just opting not to let Judd have a new england accent, that is what painted the eerie tone of Judds character in the book and movie. It was creepy. the accent gets into your psyche and lends to the ambiance of the story. paints a mood. theres no reason not to have it, unless John Lithgow just cant do a new england accent for some reason. but its an easy accent, and whats the problem...... also, what is the deal with the kids wearing animal masks? thats nowhere in the book. are they trying to combine children of the corn for flair, or tongue in cheek, since its stephen king? UNNECESSARY. again, this story is scary enough without all this garbage. and i doubt theyll have time to flesh out relationships between main characters with all this ""reboot"" filler garbage. theres no cult of children in the book, or first film. and it wouldnt make sense if there was. its not part of the story. so how are they going to add that without it being pointless?... and pascow and timmy were two very crucial elements in the story and first film, that were already done to perfection. changing pascows character(im not talking about his race, but his origin. making him something more powerful and wise.) and omitting the story of timmy is totally needless. pascow is already everything the story needs him to be. why would you add extra layers when the story doesnt require it?...... Also, why show the scene where Judd gets his achilles tendon cut IN THE TRAILER??? are you trying to give the entire movie away? That scene in the first film was a huge punch to the psyche, and youre just going to waste that moment for a gag in the preview or some kind of throwback nod? break the fourth wall some more why dont you. do you even care about making a film thats going to be scary, or is this a joke? because it looks like a joke. it looks like that is the whole point of this effort, to make fun of the original film and book asif they are basic. man, you cant hold a candle to the original. you dont understand HALF of what is necessary to do what the originals did and  i feel embarrassed for you....... maybe you should take your own advice, ""sometimes dead is better."" i have a feeling thats going to ring poetic after this thing opens.",0,0,Leto77,zK0LNzU2TQI,0.008255750273822545,2019-03-12 16:25:37,True,True

It won‚Äôt be *THAT* bad. I get people like the books more I get that. Imagination is sometimes better than imagery. Trust me on this, the visuals in this will likely help the film overall. Because.. CGI.   I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs gonna be successful. But it *COULD* be a decent movie.   I do agree that the trailers for movies nowadays give way too much info. But if anything it‚Äôs a more developed background info on a book in a sense. Just with more details.   Ellie is a better choice for death. Especially with some of the images like the animal masks. No toddler could wear one. Also, a toddler holding a knife are you guys fucking insane? I get it, it‚Äôs horror but come on!  Plus, a little girl who sees her dead cat and is alive again, and gets run over by a speeding truck is just more of a reason to ‚Äúbring her from the dead‚Äù. Especially for Louis. prompting the rest of the movie. So overall I agree with some of these changes.    (Also I‚Äôd want to see a wendigo on screen only for a bit. Nothing stretched, but I want to feel terrified by such a creature as well prompting me to possibly think ‚Äúwill it cause havoc?

2019-03-14T10:20:35,"I gotta say that making it clear that Ellie is swapped for Gage in the trailer was a shit move (not the fact that it happens, but the fact that it's shown in the trailer), even if you don't know the source material it's still a shit move. It would have been far better for the old readers and fans (and even the new audience) to have been hit with that detail in the theater, now any impact that the twist might have had is completely gone. While I'm feeling pretty meh about knowing in advance that Ellie will be getting a close-up with the Orinco truck instead of Gage, maybe it will still be able to bring something fresh so I'll give it a shot. I'm really wishing that they don't give us any front and center interactions with the Wendigo because there are already too many ""creature features"" these days and they all lack subtlety. I hope that any wendigo appearances are kept fleeting and at a distance, and that we don't get a whole herd of revenants by the end of the film. So far I get the feeling we won't be seeing much of the Goldmans as Rachel seems to be at home for the heavy bits, if so, then we'll lose some of the excellent dynamic between Louis and Irwin.

I hadn‚Äôt even heard of pet semetary. In this dream, I would walk out of my high school on a slightly snowy day. Not a person or car in sight. In the parking lot would be one of my beloved, deceased dogs. I would walk over to them, cry and hug them, glad to see them for only a moment more, as I had wished since the day they passed. They would gladly take the affection, then pause, and walk over to the road. I would follow. They would stop in the middle of the roadway and sit. No matter what I thought about the danger, I would kneel down and pet them. The dog would smile at me menacingly. Somewhat similar to Smile.jpg, the somewhat creepy image of a husky or something with a human like smile. After it smiled, it would look down the road, and there would be a semi heading straight toward us at full speed. I would die along with the dog. This happened quite a few times.

I used to hike long distances right out the back door for hours through those hills just exploring and one day I stumbled upon a relatively large pet cemetery. It was laid out the exact same way in circles. Well, there was a few cats that wandered around the woods and you could hear them hissing and screaming at night. This one scraggly, beat up tom cat stayed around there for years. He wouldnt let you near him and would always walk off when you came outside. He wouldn't run, he would just slowly walk away and periodically turn and look.  One day, this cat was just laying on my porch dead. I felt bad for the old guy and carried him over 3 mountains to that cemetery I had found. This is no shit people. I had this dead, solid stiff cat in a black bag right behind me as I dug a hole at the outer edge of the cemetery.  I heard the bag behind me suddenly violently shaking. I turn around and just the bag is laying there and the cat is gone  You can smell this very strong dead odor. I don't see the cat, hear the cat, nothing. About 3 months later I'm out fixing a hole on the chicken coup and something catches my eye  Its that fucking cat up I  the woods between two bushes.  He just stares at me and you can tell hes sorta wet and scraggly.

Having the little girl getting killed instead of Gage was an interesting shift from the novel, but having her converse with her father and mother after she rose from the dead 100% castrated the horror element. It did the worst thing possible you can do in a horror movie; it personified the evil hence nullifying the mystery of it, effectively robbing it of all its potency. After that point it became at best a generic slasher flick, at worst a comedy.  ""Hey kiddo, it looks like you have some staples in the back of your head here. Don't let the kids at school tease you about them, they're only there to hold your brains in your skull, they're just immature, sweetheart. See you at the bus stop after school.""  I mean, come the fuck on. It's too bad really as the movie was doing really well up until the end, but the original movie is superior because for all its cheese and corniness, at least it kept the barrier between the mysterious evil of the dead and the malevolence that gave rise to it contrasted against the naive but hopeless hopes of the living in taking desperate measures to recover what was forever and irrecoverably lost.

Unless you're a rigid nostalgia junkie who only wants to see a verbatim recreation of the original adaptation I don't think you'll see that much of a difference between them switching Ellie and Gage's roles in the film. I give props to the filmmakers for trying something original. They know that the original Pet Sematary is a classic horror film of the 80's and that the audience of the 2019 film are going to be familiar with the original so they decided to give you something new that doesn't stray too far from the spirit of the original film.

2019-04-27T06:37:06,"*TO THOSE THAT READ THE BOOK AND ARE ANTICIPATING THE ATMOSPHERIC COSMIC TERROR THEREIN:* You may be slightly disappointed.   I must stress that the movie has a pacing problem, introducing events at an accelerated rate that disallows the relation we had to the characters from the older film and especially the book. Additional thereto, the Lovecraftian Cosmic Horror is largely absent with greater emphasis being placed on body horror, gore grotesquerie, and jump scares. There is, to an extent, still a degree of psychological suspense; the soundtrack is wonderful; and the characters are well acted but, otherwise, this film seems to be more an overbudgeted cash grab seizing upon the renewed interest in King adaptations. To those ignorant of or unfamiliar to King literature, the book in question in particular, then it is a decent horror movie that is worth the money but, if you were a true diehard fan of both the book and the first movie, then this sucker will come up short.   I loved seeing it, I will probably go to see it again but, it is by no means the most faithful cinematization of the original story. It does throw in some original twists and turns though so, at least they tried to make it surprising to viewers like yours truly but, it was not as good as ""IT"" in my opinion, nor the 1980's film.",9,1,David Jones,zK0LNzU2TQI,0.2440993788819876,2019-04-27 06:37:06,False,True

This movie however, had me scared shitless the entire break. The ost was amazing, clarke played louis better than midkiff, and of course, lithgow playing jud was fantastic. Now SPOILER ALERT, for those who didnt like the change from gage to ellie dying i understand. For those who said they didnt have the balls to kill gage, you should've watched the movie before judging it seeing as they all die. Ellie was 5x creepier than gage, and he was scary. Each person has something that makes their skin crawl. For me, its contortions, possessions, and reanimation. These all combined in this movie for a horrifying yet great movie that left my heart pounding all the way to its bitter ending.  WARNING MORE SPOILERS  You can argue that both movies have similar endings, but they seem to overlook the fact that in the original louis was able to kill gage/ the reanimated. In the new one, no one, not even the other sibling escaped death.  All in all, this movie left me scared for a week and them some. Now keep in mind that these are just my thoughts, and i dont want to force anyone to agree with me (though that may be a bit hypocritical after all i just said) it may not satisfy everyone, but it left me content.

2019-05-15T00:08:51,"I think this, honestly, was a marketing plunder. I understand that the 2019 version is adapted to suit a new audience who possibly hasn't seen the original 1980's version of the movie, much less read the book, because both were from a time before they were born, but it seems so clumsily employed! As a child of the 90's, I was extremely excited to hear this movie was being re-made. Literally, I got scared just thinking about it, with the memories rushing back (LOL)... until I saw the trailer. Getting back to my original point, I don't think they set out to ruin the original book's story, or to spoil the ending of THIS story with that ridiculous trailer, but succeeded with both. If they had done their homework, they could have figured out what the 'target audience' wanted, which would have been the original fans of King's work, the generation x and early millennials who can still remember the books and original campy 80's version. We would have been the ones who would have really wanted to see it for the nostalgia and to compare it to a closer version of what we remember and expect. I think, perhaps, it was a lost opportunity, and could have been a much bigger box office smash, if only they had asked their audience, or had a small research project on what this segment felt about changing the killer *spoiler* to ellie, and whatever else they are complaining about. I can understand that today's audiences have been very sheltered from the way the world was when we were younger. Maybe that's a good thing.  The angry comments about this movie seem awkwardly silly, and it shows we could all soften up a bit more, and be more open-minded. It's not the 80's or 90's anymore. This is the preferred way that horror movies are consumed now. I could go see the movie, and waste $20-30, or even read the original book if wanted to relive my childhood - but that phase is over. I am 34 years old, and I don't have the time to waste on it any longer, only to write this very detailed commenton youtube, like a nerd. ;)",0,0,Ashley Woolf,zK0LNzU2TQI,0.14589610389610388,2019-05-15 00:08:51,False,True

2019-07-20T06:53:53,The only good thing i have to say about this is it was neat to see they changed the toddler from dying to the girl. Refreshing. Wasnt expecting it. The rest was so dumb. (Spoilers) Telling me this kid gets hit by a semi and is not a half crushed bloody corpse on the road. The cat and the daughter take at least 12 hrs to come back but the mom conveniently comes back in like 2 minutes so she can kill her husband. Earlier the mom goes back to the house thinking her husband is having a mental break down or something and she brings her toddler with when he was safe where he was at. And keeps him there after seeing her zombie daughter. And then the dad leaves the toddler alone while his murdering psycho daughter is on the loose. Not to mention they didnt explain anything really like in the first one the old man knew what the sour ground was and the story around it but in this one hes like meh idk shrug heres a book or something. And then the man that died in the beginning and who had kept appearing to him warning him about the indian burial ground only showed up for a min in the beginning. I dont know i was super excited for the movie and i am just super disappointed after watching it.  First one was way better and way creepier.,0,0,Sophie Rambler,zK0LNzU2TQI,0.04879708768597656,2019-07-20 06:53:53,False,False

2019-12-22T06:47:24,"I finished the book 3 days ago and watched the movie today so here are some differences I noticed:  Introduction of the Pet Sematary - in the book the whole family and Jud walk up there, in the movie Ellie sees kids go there to bury a dog then wanders up there herself. This is also where we meet Jud for the first time in the movie.  Norma is alive in the book then dies. In the movie she‚Äôs already dead. Which I was okay with because her character wasn‚Äôt a crucial part in the book. She was pretty old and ill. In the book Rachel and Ellie have no idea that Church died since they were away for Thanksgiving. This gives Louis a chance to bury him and come back which is the cat they see when they get back.  The death of Zelda - she did not fall down a dumbwaiter but she was as ill as they showed her in the movie.  It was Gage who died in the street - not Ellie.  Rachel and the other child do go to her parents house, but only Rachel comes back when she thinks something is wrong with Louis.¬†  Rachel dies in Jud‚Äôs house by Gage, not in their own house.  Louis does not see Rachel between the time she leaves to her parents, to the time he finds her in Jud‚Äôs house dead. There was no scuffle at their house.

In this case, we have a young child who has phonetically spelled cemetery, a word for a place set apart for the burial or entombment of the dead, on a sign without a dictionary on hand. In Middle English, the word was spelled cimitery. It is from Anglo-French cimiterie, which, in turn, is from Late Latin cimiterium and coemeterium, and ultimately from Greek koimƒìtƒìrion, meaning ""sleeping chamber,"" and the verb koiman, ""to put to sleep.""

A lot of missed opportunities here, since the story in the novel is very original and they could have done something way darker and terrifying. It's like producers and director are afraid of making a proper horror film, as though if it's too scary people won't want to see it, so they water it down and turn it into an undercover family movie. That's why so many people are of the opinion that to this day the greatest horror movie ever made is The Exorcist: every one involved took the story dead seriously and pulled no punches in making the film, and people heard it was scary as fuck and still waited in line to see it at the theatre. And regarding how it compares withe 1989 version, well the '89 version is better, more intense and raw.

Spoiler: at the beginning, you'll see children with masks. But they're not the scary crazy tribal children with masks the trailer portrays them to be. I don't think this in general is a spoiler, because you figure it out pretty quickly in the movie.    It strays a LOT from the novel. It strays a LOT from the first adaptation of the book. It's different, and personally, i think it's better and ""makes more sense"" (or as much sense any horror movie could make). So yes, this version is based on the novel, but don't expect it to be a line-by-line exact adaptation. I love Stephen King, but I also love this different version.
