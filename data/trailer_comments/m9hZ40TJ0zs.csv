And in the meantime she's in a made up place called purgatory which means she's wondering the earth as a type of ghost. Yet what i hate about this film is that the girl has gone out with a typical movie boyfriend. They have no reason to be together. The only thing they're together for is the fact that she's a wicked hot teenage girl and the teenage boy is in a band and plays the guitar. There relationship is just so bloody fake, even though we know it's just a movie anyway, but that just wouldn't happen in real life. Unless the girl was a bloody whore. And the girls boyfriend goes to the hospital and says, ""I'm still here, and I'm crazy in-love with you. Please stay."". OK, that just has to make you think, because most guys really just want a girlfriend for sex, and look how sexy she is. No bloody wonder he wants her to stay. Not that, that's how i see girls, but that's how i see most guys. And this guy seems to be able to get any girl he wants, so the reality is, he could just get another girlfriend.
