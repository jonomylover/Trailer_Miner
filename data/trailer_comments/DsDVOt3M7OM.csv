All they needed to show is:1) Single mom heads to father's estate for wknd with kids 2)House is fortress but we dont know why 3)Dudes show up w/bad motives now what?..THAT'S IT! I don't need to see: a) her catching one of the bad guys b)that the reason behind the fortress is obviously money & c) damn near every fight scene in the whole movie showing me she is bascially gonna kick they a** & save her kids....like geez!

2018-05-10T04:36:27,"TL,DR: As a thriller/suspense, this looks disappointing. Why? because there isn't anything suspenseful about it. Reasons below.  Problem 1: The intruders aren't intimidating and look like the goons you'd see in Batman's Arkham games (and Gabrielle Union is Batman). What makes thrillers great is having an antagonist that invokes anxiety, suspense,  paranoia, etc., such as the blind man from Don't Breathe. Problem 2: Gabrielle's character seems overpowered against the intruders. She's acting like she was trained by special ops. This doesn't work when we're supposed to be scared for HER and her KIDS.   Hell, even the antagonist says, ""she's smart"" as if he never saw anything like it before. If she was highly trained, then her opponents need to be able to give her a challenge in the sense that they ARE a serious threat to her and her kids. But instead, the only threat here seems to be Gabrielle's character.  Again, going back to Don't Breathe: One of the elements that made the film so great was how there were advantages / disadvantages on both sides. The man's disadvantage was that he was blind, while his advantages were that he adapted to not seeing and was able to use his other senses to guide him, especially in his own house. The intruders disadvantages were the blind man's advantages while their only advantage was being able to see.    To bring it back to this film: The intruders don't seem like a threat, they look like dumb goons who are used to robbing liquor stores. They have a location-based advantage but that seems to be it. Gabrielle's character seems to be the real threat. All of a sudden, she's channeling Jason Bourne and becoming a stealthy ninja.   The problem? there is no suspense because the protagonist is essentially the threat and not the other way around, which makes zero sense. They also showed why the intruders are there... because of money in the house. I find it funny that the antagonist is like ""we want something in the house"" and they just show what it is anyway. Why be so secretive about what it is when it's just..... money?",0,0,"RIP Mac Miller, you helped me with a lot",DsDVOt3M7OM,0.07576984126984128,2018-05-10 04:36:27,False,True

If that's not enough the thiefs turn from just wanting money to wanting to kill everyone including the kids who they held hostage for most of the movie then decide let's kill them too for no apparent reason.
