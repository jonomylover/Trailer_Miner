Am talking IAGLM seriously funny etc. his movies soul plane paper soldiers are right up there with the best. Now here is the dilemma kev got to a stage which is not normal for any comedian since Dave and before the being Chris rock & Eddie anyways he surpassed all of them he may not be funnier in some eyes but his bigger numbers don't lie. All ethnicities come to his shows so he had to alter his jokes to cater to all, yes it takes away from but he had to its common sense. Chris rock specials some of them weren't funny. Now if katt and Bernie (my favs btw along with kev) had got as big they could lose some of black content. Which would makes us laugh hard. But they never which is why you think they funnier bcos all you remember is their old shit and not as big. If you've truly followed kevs career like I have. Kev to me is truly an icon his funny and a go getter going to the top left every behind and stuck true boss. Cut out all this his illuminati bcos they've all worn dress minus katt and Dave.",0,0,Shad Miller,iUfsjUgod3I,0.10317460317460317,2017-06-12 17:57:46,False,False
