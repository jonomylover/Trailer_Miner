I think there setting out to make a similar but smarter movie than the original but it's too close in story to not be called point break and use the same character names. Plus brand recognition can only help with the box office if you don't like this one then that's fine guess what that does to the original.....

The action looks real and stunning (who knows how it'll look in the actual movie with the 3D), the cinematography looks gorgeous, the acting is descent, and the dialogue sounds cheezy but at the same time naturally fun. HOWEVER, based off of the trailer, this is NOT POINT BREAK. Like what you said, if this was a sequel to the original film, then I would accept this. Secondly, I have NO problems with a remake changing things from the original and/or adding new things that hadn't previously existed, even if the original was good. Finally, I wouldn't mind taking some of the same themes, plot and dialogue from the original all the while bringing/adding new things in the mix like updating the robbers to make them not just surfers, but extreme sports athletes AND Robin Hood-like anti-hero figures as well. But, the main problem with the movie so far is the opposite problem with the recent POLTERGEIST remake. While the POLTERGEIST remake was just a rehash of the original except with bigger/modern effects and some changes/alterations here and there with characters and story elements/lines, this looks nothing like the original in terms of tone, characters, and dialogue except for character names and the basic storyline that it just comes to a point where it just seems to bare only the title and character names just so the people who are familiar and nostalgic with the original can go see the new one and make lots of money at the box office for the studio. I'm still curious to see this film and how it turns out. Like any movie, I want this to be good. It has a descent director, writer, cast and crew who seem passionate about this and can tell that they are putting their heart and soul into it. It may as well be a descent action film, but it's relation to the original thus far has made me cautiously skeptical and wondering, just like everyone else, what is the point of this if you are just going to change almost EVERYTHING from the original except for the title and character names like I said?

I don't really get the ' he's interrupting the international financial markets' whilst obviously creaming shed loads to fund his endless summer.

2015-05-27T18:46:17,"Maybe this will help Warner Bros....Real Bodhi (P.Swayze) had an unspoken for son with a bad ass chick years before he went on his bank robbing extreme sports bender. Knowing her son would follow in his fathers dark foot steps she fled LA to raise her son in a safe environment...But genes can't be changed. The son grows up to be an action sports legend. Always feeling as if something is missing he is disgruntled about where he comes from. His mother finally tells her son where he comes from (the legendary surfer bank robbing hero) and gives the son a footlocker full of all of his dads personal items. Hidden inside the baseboard of the footlocker is a list of all his old crews names, occupations, and locations. The bank robbery thing was just a small part of something HUGE...Taking down the global financial infrastructure. As he digs deeper into the world his father lived in he finds out Bodhi's former crew has now established themselves as an international crime syndicate. In an effort to clear his fathers name the son teams up with Johnny Utah (who is now a quite relaxed surfer type living off the grid in Australia.) Johnny of course finds the son first just by watching him surf ""The RIGHT"" in an effortless bodacious fashion. Johnny approaches the son to find out this is Bodies KID!!! LIKE WHOOOAA!!! Now he is torn between his new found quite lifestyle and working with Bodhi's son to take down the old crew (of course Johnny feels he owes Bodhi and he may find some self redemption for helping Bodies son).

Basically it had nothing to do with the common people, his beef was with the government. The surfing was his outlet , he was free when he surfed and when the money ran out , they went and robbed banks to stick it to powers that be and lived their lives of freedom with the governments money. Plot !!!!  add Johnny Utah as a former star quarterback that could've went pro if he didnt blow he knee out. Now he's an young FBI agent partnered with a veteran agent Nick Nolte. add the love intrest and the admiration of Brohdi , learning how to surf because they figured whoever was robbing banks was living the surf guy lifestyle.

It almost seems like someone didn't do their homework however it's not that I expect they are actually going to make a tamer, minimal special f/x, realistic cop movie like those from the early 90's, it only makes sense for it to be bigger and badder in scope, otherwise what's the point right? This is the first remake that I have seen that I could be like one of those ""ahh they ruined the whole thing"" guys cuz I do love the original so damn much but to be honest, it's not like I am expecting them to re-do something that is as good as Point Break because essentially, it is so damn great because it is a gem of it's time, it's got young Keanu who's name is friggin Johnny Utah, young Swayzee who's name is friggin Bodhizafa and a hilarious Busey who likes lemonade with two meatball sandwhichs, that's right two! It really was cool defined for that time, it had the usual banks heists, car chases and fist fights but it also had beach football at night, a crazy and experimental for the time footchase that seemed too surreal and a cocky lead with a 90's generation attitude that gladly threw it in the face of his old timer superiors who no noubt were sickened by the younger demographic, which was highly accurate of the time. A classic film of it's day to say the least. The point is, they are not going to remake Point Break in anyway that fully satisfies fans of the original but I can enjoy this movie cause it really does look pretty bad ass on it's own, remake or not and I know no matter how much they stray from the path of the original, it's still a nod to that amazing film.

Isn't that Interpol or CIA territory? Before anyone tells me they changed his job, uh: ""FBI is going to teach me to surf?"" Is one of the most quoted lines of the original.  Also, what plane full of money is flying over third world countries? Do you know how rare it is to transport cash via plane? Let alone over the effing jungle.   God, the whole cast looks like a bunch of GAP rejects, none have any kind of personality or even unique looks about them, and Utah is an extreme athlete from the start.... why? The whole damn point was that he was a squeaky clean guy put undercover and torn between two lives. Can't really be torn if you start off where the bad guys are. Also since when did the gang kill???

I love the original and nothing will replace it.  However I'm looking on the positive side 100% about this remake. The guys in it including the main actors and stunt athletes that are  involved are all  hard core point break fans as far as I  researched. Regardless of Hollywood money remake etc, I think this movie is going to be insane if you just sat back enjoyed and relived the point break spirit in it.

Everybody who is along for the ride do so at their peril.  All these elements will be lacking or shot wide of the mark.
