Granted, you could kind of tell how dumb the movie would be, to an extent, in the trailer, when they are catching the fast-moving space probe with the robot arm.  But it is gratifying to watch some of the bad actors die off at least.   I know they wanted to be a different kind of space movie, than _The Martian_, etc, and they succeeded -- since those other films were actually good.

First off, you would think a team that was chosen to go to space to encounter alien life would be at the very least decently smart, but each of them somehow make completely dumb and emotionally driven decisions that ultimately puts them in a shittier situation. Second of all, when Earth sent a capsule to push them into deeper space as a fail-safe move, how is it that only Miranda would know? Why didn't she tell everyone else before hand? Shouldn't there be some sort of procedure so EVERYONE will be aware of what will be happening, instead of having team members guess and possibly make the wrong choice, like Sho did, and blow off the frigging capsule and put the whole shuttle in orbit? You would think that such a HUGE decision like this would be really planned out before hand so no one will do anything stupid.
