2015-12-12T12:33:35,Oh my god there really is a Ghost dimension every human has the ability to see into a different dimension I swear ever since I was young I was always a loner I did have a few friends I hungout with for a few years thought they were true friends but they weren't! But ever since I was really young I always felt this intense attraction to the Earth im not sure how to describe it but I feel like im more connected with my soul then mostly everyone ive met I truely believe in God with all my heart ive seen go(o)d--god and ive seen    evil--devil scientists have already proved that humans and all life put off faint amounts of electricity I believe this to be our souls! Only some humans are capable of seeing into the ghost dimension I believe these are the people who have chosen to be loners there whole lives these are the people who are usually bullied or are looked  down on in some way or another! These are the people who only speak when they feel the time is right not the people who are constantly speaking for there attention and putting others down to make themselves feel better! I swear if you really concentrate you can see a different dimension its not like you literally leave your body its just that your seeing in a different way I saw my two dogs that unfortunately passed away in the same week last year the one chiwawa we had lived 18 years and there only supposed to live around 14 and my other one that was much younger actually passed away just before him a couple days before were guessing it was his bladder stones :/  But you can see energy from living and non living objects as well non living appears like a dark fuzzy outline and living appears like a white outline it almost reminded me of when a television loses signal it gets really fuzzy black and white but I believe I saw my dog laying in his closet clear as day but in black and white.,0,0,justinlikesprototype,zR2cc1BwdmI,0.017805435305435297,2015-12-12 12:33:35,False,True

2017-10-20T18:28:39,"i've seen a few demon cat ghosts in my life and felt several spirits touching all over my body while I was trying to go to sleep and it felt like the temperature dropped to below zero keep in mind this happened in Florida. Also I herd voices an entire conversation of my brother in law who was 15 miles away in bed. I have no explanation except the dream I had about being visited by the ghost of a lil black kid who was hit by a car who befriended me in the dream but then went bad ghost and terrorized me and I woke up. Also had boxes flipped around and rearranged during our move and voices in my head which I spoke uncontrollably This is not your home anymore and my moms said I zoned out and repeated this over and over in a child voice something I can't possibly even mimic at age 32. Than I started whispering it over and over again at least 2 dozen times. I thought the story was perfect for halloween month so I will share. I have seen and experienced many paranormal things of but christian and satanic origins. I have even communicated with music to lucifer when you flip my music around the entire song is a new song clear as day. even a comparison that Lucifer may have been or is a muslim now. The original song was about vampires. But the voices of a damned soul appear in the song trapped in hell and on drugs and so much other stuff. I have seen demonic activity first hand and experienced it in and on others. I have seen aliens, ufos, What humanity think is strange fiction I have experienced the reality of the supernatural and what the masses think is still makebelieve or psuedosciences. Boy you people are in for a cruel awakening! My home the first day we moved a black cat immediate crosses my path as I get out the car. that same cat is later roadkilled and I saw the same cat in the grass at night for about 2 secs and it vanished. I've seen orbs captured when I took a photo of myself of intense energy from many different angles but when I took a photo by a piece of wall art from the lone star state the 6 pentagram star art which was found in a strange place Big Lots...I've been in big lots many times before and I never seen this piece of paranormal art. Anyway I took the photo and it took a photo of me and Now this is truely impossible because the lens isn't facing me!!! It looks like something pagans made from hand centuries ago. Anyway...if you wanted to know if the paranormal shit is true or not...It is! Whatever it was the powers that be did not want us to move they did everything they could to get us to leave. This house also has strange masonic markings on it and maybe haunted by the people murdered here in the distant past or a possible suicide as their was red stains in the carpet and a triangle with masonic markings of the number 33, 13 and 23. The strange thing is this place was fitted with all new carpet so why is the carpet look like it has wine stains on it...More paranormal activity. They can't hide the past whatever happened in this house b4 us keeps unearthing itself it can't be kept secret or hidden or destroyed and covered up.",0,0,Zetan G0D,zR2cc1BwdmI,0.04136518243661103,2017-10-20 18:28:39,False,False

( I‚Äôve seen at least one for each movie) and from all the trailers I have seen the 5th & 6th one looked the scariest. It‚Äôs funny because I think those 2 were the least liked among movie critics & I don‚Äôt think they were received well among audiences either. But to me they looked horrifying, maybe it‚Äôs because, by watching those 2 trailers I could get a better sense of a story. I know that this may sound weird, but by watching the trailers for the other movies, I could not get much of a sense for a clear cut story. It just looked like a documentary with demons floating around. They also looked like they had spefic things that were scary happening ( you know other than things being knocked over or people just being removed from their beds at random, because demons LOVE to do that in the Hollywood films these days) For in example the 5th Trailer a guy gets marked, has things happen to his skin & sees a girl say in a creepy fashion, he is waiting for you. Then in the 6th one ( which is obviously this one) One gets to see the ghost or demon that has been haunting everyone. I know that some people didn‚Äôt like the idea of seeing it, but I like the idea of seeing things and thought it‚Äôs what actually made this trailer the scariest & that scene where the creature beak in the pool is startling. I especially thought the scene where the girl is saying Bloody Mary backwards, while looking in a mirror was terrifying to give anyone the shivers.
