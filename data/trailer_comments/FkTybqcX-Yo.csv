They had to use Bucky here where he shouldn't have been. The real reason behind it is more political.  Due to the increasing numbers of B-list heroes who have been blatantly failing in saving people, the government issued a mandate that all past, present and future ""inhumans/Enhanceds"" must be registered and be screened fit to to be a hero with it they also have to surrender their secret identities. Capt. America saw this as a liability rather than a fix. What if the enemy managed to hack said registry and used all that info against the heroes. He opposed the mandate backed up by the Avengers and affiliated heroes  Iron Man and Ant-man saw this a sign of stability. They were tired of B-list heroes left unchecked who more bad than good and they also saw earth-foreign entities as a liability and could not be fully trusted.

Cap: Has little no no upgrades to his overall gear and strengths in close counters combat fighting (This is why all the #TeamIronMan is nervous at the end of the trailer). Cap also has a shield with a seriously strong medal.   Iron Man:  Has a new suit, witch If I assume correctly, is the Model 38 Bleeding edge Armor (Not as known because it came before the Iron destroyer armor). This suit has a huge impact on the Marvel Comic Universe, It‚Äôs perks include:  Mentally Commanded: kept inside Tonys skin until tony needs it  Nano Machines that can turn into: clothes, other previous Iron man armors, or even different beings completely, by having the Nano-machines change their properties into whatever Tony wants them to be  Powered by the high-yield R.T. node mounted in Tony‚Äôs chest: the node can greatly augment Stark's intelligence and provided him with superhuman-level multitasking and learning capabilities  Weaponry, witch includes: repulsers, uni-beam, pulse bolts, tasers, and an ENERGY BLADE  So yeah, sorry cap. I cant say I am or will ever support you. Guys no crap with this armor Tony beat RED HULK FULLY AMPED. Plus, it helped him in going toe to toe with Thor, and allowed him the skills to become the most powerful hero on earth.   #TeamIronMan",2,0,TheEventsOf1989,FkTybqcX-Yo,0.14499890206411944,2016-02-23 23:45:29,True,True

Iron Man is very cool but after 4 movies I am sick of the terrible jokes and humor but I did really enjoy the important deeper moments in the movies. Honestly I don't care they are fighting because the way tony talks to Cap  and I didn't really see their friendship develop in the other movies. its as if it was going to happen anyway. perhaps that was Marvels intention here then at the end Tony will realize how important Cap really is to him but he doesn't realize it yet.,0,0,Stratagem271,FkTybqcX-Yo,0.07078643578643579,2016-03-02 18:49:43,True,True

I dont agree with everything the accords stand for, but I was totally on team Iron Man in Civil War. Their destructions and casaulties was too much. They couldnt just roll in every country without legal justice to do so. Cap didnt agree with anything. His honor was too high as well as his ego.
