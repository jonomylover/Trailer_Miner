It's like saying that Gary Oldman should not get an Oscar for Churchill - he was also totally 'disguised', but that's what total acting is all about - you are changing externally and internally, every acting job is a dress-up, evey actor has some make up, disguise - more or less. And you know that with authentic characters, you always have to externally change. Just like Nicole Kidman turned into Virginia Woolf, but does the ''dress-up'' deprive her role of genius in showing the emotions of the character? No, because both things  - physicality and emotions - matter in acting and Bale is great in this trailer, you can tell, thats why we talking Oscars.

I've already lost any hope for this movie being good.

(Interesting too, from this misogynist's perspective, to hear how much Dick was 'pushed' by his ambitious wife. I've long recognized that 'wives' and women generally are all-too-often the subtle force back of what they allege is a 'male thing', of insatiable hunger for power and wealth etc)  What life and power make of possibly otherwise reasonable people, huh?  My point, in part, is that we rarely get 'behind the shopfronts' of powerful people, and investigate, diagnose and diss-assemble their psychological motivations, corruptions and soon-enough (especially when 'all the wealth of the world' is offered, pertinent to Thom's metaphorical use of 'the devil') dysfunctions, all-too-often taken as 'normal' up there in high places.  Taking the next step in this analysis, we see that mental dysfunction is indeed the norm' 'up high', such that all players, all after some similar level of power and the concomitant material wealth, fame, and prestige, are totally unbalanced, and, for it, are the chief propagators of dysfunction all the way out and down in society, and across the globe.  Such that the whole culture, pushed by all mainstream media, including the likes of Hollywood of course, condones, celebrates, salutes and rewards all these - 'sins' and sinners. (Nope! Me! Atheist!!!)  Only Righteous, Fearless Media, supported by a similarly Right-Minded Judiciary, can expose and break the secrecies these private FOR-PROFIT, big corp rascals always use to climb the pyramids of power.  That includes, very much, if not more so, breaking the hexes, spells and mind control powers the chief religions have had and abused over the powerless flocks, for at least a few thousand years.  All-up these are why I assert that it's imperative that all of 'We, The People', support and protect the Judiciary.  No matter to begin with that most in there have been long forced (by for-profits) to be corrupt, so were long ago forced to corrupt the fundamental 'Laws of the Land' and Taxation, thence all lesser laws thru their Courts, onto the streets, and warzones.

Love the ""Hallmark"" Style The End Commercial in the middle-CLASSIC!--the speech Colin Powell gave to The United Nations played by Tyler Perry (very accurately), showed Mr. Powell's inner objection. I remember all of these events as many others do. While clearly the Iraq War was about Oil and a bad move--Mr. Cheney and President Bush did keep their Promise to the American People. The last Interview I also remember very well--He did what we asked him to do. Do I support torture? Hell NO! Do I support War? NEVER! I do however believe our Country was attacked that day. This movie brilliantly shows the BS of Washington and it's overstuffed Bureaucracy and how it functions or doesn't. It shows the way The White House ""Spins"" the Truth and renames it all the time. Most if not all of this is so true. Is this movie funny? It is brutal in your face reality. And it is important that this film got made. Christian Bale= Outstanding. Amy Adams also did such a great job being the Powerhouse behind the man. As so many women truly are. And Cheney's daughter Mary having her private life just put out there for all the world to judge and take apart. So awful. Sam Rockwell did a bang up job playing President George Bush. But while I disagree with President Bush on some things, I will always be grateful to him for doing what Americans needed-to be protected. Iraq however; that's a different fight that was never ours. America does not own the Middle East. We should probably rebuild our own Country first. This movie, ""Vice"", asks a very important question regarding Absolute Power of The US President. This is so relevant because we are now on a road where Checks and Balances do not even exist anymore.
