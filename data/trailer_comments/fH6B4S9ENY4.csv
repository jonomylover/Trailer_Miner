The memories are passed down in order to keep them alive while the rest of humanity lives in small communities with everything regulated and controlled to ensure fairness and happiness. Nobody can see color, nor feel strong emotions. Jobs are given based on performance in distinct areas of school, Birth is given by selected individuals and death is not known to anyone. Old people and sick people are ""sent off"" nobody knows they are being killed.

Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her sister's place to go into the hunger games and she sparks a revolution which turns into a huge war between the Capitol and the districts.

Tris Prior is Divergent, which means she doesn't belong anywhere but she chooses to be in Dauntless. Tris can't fit in, and the Erudite and some of Dauntless start a war to kill the Divergents because they believe they are a threat to the society. Tris loses a lot during the war but she continues to find out things about the past and discovers more about what the faction system actually meant. Tris and her loved ones (and Peter lol) take it hard. Tris realizes that her divergence was simply a part of the experiment and her whole world was a lie. But there's more to it.

The people greet him and he stands at the back of the room watching as the singing finishes and they hand out presents.  He is told that society is slowly recovering somewhat, but there are bad things still in the world.  At the compound there is chaos as people start encountering their emotions.  The Giver, meanwhile, is taken to the 'Place of Repose' where he is shown the body of the founder of the community which is frozen.  The president (Meryl Streep) said they were instructed to push certain buttons if the community ever came into trouble.  She pushes them, and a host of needles are plunged into the leader, who recovers over the next few days.  The giver is also shown Rosemary's body, who is then resucitated also.  Jonas returns to the compound to see if he can now lead them back into society, but he will encounter a new struggle with the resucitated founder.  He becomes friends with Rosemary.  The founder takes Jonas aside and tells him of an old wager.  Who could rule the world.  His wife established, on the other side of the world, a corresponding compound. When a certain time came to pass, both of them would be resucitated (although it has happened early for the founder) and would compete for reclaiming the world.  As they decide to now do that anyway, towards the end of the second movie they encouter forces of power from the rival compound.  And that is how the second movie ends.

2020-01-30T01:24:28,Jonas doesn’t get caught going to elsewhere in the book. He actually makes it with Gabe. And I wonder if the girl who was being interrogated was Rosemary or Fiona. Fiona has red hair and so does the girl who was being asked questions. Fiona doesn’t know about anything yet Rosemary knows everything. The girl said there’s something missing from their lives. So I’m confused there but I guess I should just watch the movie. It seems awesome though!,0,0,Mackenzie Talbot,fH6B4S9ENY4,0.07999999999999999,2020-01-30 01:24:28,False,False

2020-04-21T00:17:46,5 years late but whatever this is what is wrong with the movie (never seen the movie but have a read the book and seen the movie trailer)   1. Jonas it supposed to have light eyes. 2. The community is supposed to be black and white (only Jonas and the giver can see colour). 3. The only thing they said was futuristic in the book was the planes in a way that they had a body heat sensor. 4. They are supposed to be Eleven then twelve. 5. No one kissed and Jonas did not tell anybody about the memories (the only thing close to it was the fact he got mad about his friends playing war because of the memory) 6. the thing I'm most mad about.....   THE GIVER TOUCHED HIS BACK TO GIVE MEMORIES NOT HIS WRIST.    ( I'm upset that the actors do not look twelve)  (I'm also upset that Taylor swift is rosemary no hate to Taylor but not who I pictured rosemary to be/look like.),1,2,Rachel 1976,fH6B4S9ENY4,-0.07051282051282051,2020-04-21 00:17:46,False,False
