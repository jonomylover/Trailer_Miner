Soon we might have to figure that out in real life! With the push to put colonies on Mars there could actually be real life stories like this soon! Then the laws would have to change to define who these children are legally and also perspectives would have to change as well! We wouldn't be defining ourselves based on country of origin, but hopefully as members of one entire species of people! If not, then where would these children fit in on our world if they could come back? They are part of us! They are human! This is going to be a big one! Hopefully we make the right decisions in regards to them and do not hurt them! Hopefully they can come to regard themselves as one of us, even when they do not live on the same planet as us!

Apparently in the future we have no birth control or pregnancy tests, you can keep the first birth on Mars secret for 16 years, you can chat from Earth to Mars instantly, no time delay at all, and you barf in zero-g in a regular hospital barf bag. If you grow up on Mars and go to Earth then in 2 days your heart will double in size, which causes nosebleeds and seizures (who knew?) that can instantly be cured by flying into the stratosphere where as we all know there is no gravity and you can fly from CA to FL East to West, then hop on the next Mars shuttle, they leave every 20 minutes you know. The police can't get past a wire fence but if you fly a crop duster 500 miles Gary Oldman will be right there to watch you crash in a fireball that somehow will not burn down the old wooden barn you crashed into. The same kid with the seizures and nosebleeds and cardiomegaly who can barely cope with Earths enormous gravity can nevertheless chase down an airplane and survive jumping out as it lands just fine. Just don't ask him to lay down in the back seat he will die for sure. There's more, much more, and I haven't even gotten to the awful writing, crappy music, and directing so bad it has Asa Butterfield lurching around like a zombie and (I can hardly believe I'm saying this) can't even get a decent performance out of Gary Oldman.

2018-10-07T18:11:03,"The Space Between Us Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, 2017 The Space Between Us is about the first human born on the Mars - Gardner Elliot. The film stars Gary Oldman, Asa Butterfield, Britt Robertson, Carla Gugino.  The film was released on February 3, 2017 by STXfilms. It received negative reviews from critics and was a box office bomb, grossing $14.8 million against its $30 million budget. In the near future, Nathaniel Shepard, CEO of Genesis, launches the first ever mission to colonize Mars. During the journey, the lead astronaut, Sarah Elliot, discovers that she is pregnant. Shortly after landing, she dies while giving birth to the first human born on Mars. The father of the child is unknown. In a dilemma, Nathaniel eventually decides to keep the child on Mars as a secret. Sixteen years later, Sarah's son, Gardner Elliot, has grown up into an inquisitive, highly intelligent boy. Gardner logs on to an Internet chatroom, where he has struck up an online relationship with Tulsa, a street smart girl from Colorado who is constantly being shuffled from one foster home to the next.  I love the acting in this film. Asa Butterfield stars as Gardner Elliot and Britt Robertson  plays the role of Tulsa. My favourite character is Gardner Elliot because he is very smart, brave and purposeful. I think this is an ideal film for people who like adventures and fantasy. I give The Space Between Us 5/5.",0,0,–ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞ Yoite,x73-573aWfs,0.17287784679089024,2018-10-07 18:11:03,False,False

I thought it was in here but it's actually on Netflix.  :(  But you can rent it in here as you see.  :)  I can't specifically quote any thing DT quoted from this but I also(hopefully) sent you the DP video in here where he show DT's tweet about Mars.  If you see it you'll see why I think instead of his passion for the wall,  being the child he is, he might take on this as his new project even after he said last week NASA wasn't necessary.  And giving them 1.3 billion is as him telling America the wall would only cost 8.5 million or something.  It would cost a couple hundred billion if not more!  He loves spending our money when he hasn't paid taxes for decades.  :(  It's the main reason he won't show us his previous taxes or his currant ones.  Always an excuse.  And going to Mars would cost a lot more than that!  And as usually he doesn't know what he's talking about.  These are some more of his made up stats he's trying to sell. . again.  I never could understand it or his willingly ignorant followers who would only have to look stats for themselves to find out he lying and doesn't know what he's talking about.  As usual.  I still wonder where he stole the money from to create all those concentration camps where the children are dying because their not heated.  And they don't have proper beds or blankets.  There aren't any Doctors or nurses helping them.  What really gets me is the Americans who kidnap the children by the parents they will take them and clean them up!  Same tactics as the Nazi's during WW2.  They told the Jews, gypsies, Romanies, homosexuals, simple people, etc., that after days of being in a cramped box car with a bucket for 62 people, that they were going to give them showers.  :(  I hope you got this as I'm not sure I did it correctly.
