If you cast Asians, the film would not have an appeal to Americn udiences, and that includes blacks and whites. It's also funny, complaints from blacks who whine that horror movies always cast whites, whereas blacks turn around and create their own movies, NOT featuring any whites. But, let me guess, THAT isn't racist? What about remaking white movies, such as ""Annie"", or ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""The Honeymooners"" or ""The Nutty Professor"" or ""I Am Legend"" with black casts? It's all reverse racism, that will be proven by any negative arguments against my argument itself here. A final thought: horror movies make whie people look like absolute morons, so if blacks want to be cast in those roles, so be it. Of course, then blacks will whine that they are being portrayed as idiots.

2016-03-07T18:49:39,"From some bleeding-heart tosser that you don't want to hear from: people routinely go into this forest to hang themselves. There are signs early into the forest saying ""there is hope"" and ""seek help"" and such and such. For a legitimate view, there's a VICE documentary about it where some guy (Japanese) ventures in and tries to persuade people to NOT die and return to civilisation.  I've been-there-done-that and I - and so does my family - have the scars to prove it.  No-one who dies in that way is going to have enough venom to attack random strangers. To make a straight-to-video horror movie out of this subject is, as a person who has broached this subject via a serious illness, filthy and gross. I should just calm down and get over it; just a bunch of dudes with a *lightbulb!* idea who decided to make a silly horror movie.  But there are literally skeletons wreathed in rotting clothing still hanging from trees in that place. They are not going to grab you and drag you underground. They need to be respected and so do their families, not prostituted into another garden-variety, opportunist American film below F-grade that thought ""oh wait - this is a good idea!"".  So might be a good film if you enjoyed the first Evil Dead. Otherwise, sorry bros, please choose some different subject matter. There are films about Nazi soldiers coming back to life just for shits and giggles. No horror films about the camps themselves. There are documentaries about notable suicide ""hotspots' - no horror films about them.  This is annoying to a lot of ""oh whatever"" morons but seriously, fuck the premise of this film and those that thought it would be a REMOTELY decent thing to shoot. It is just the perfect example of Western (forgive my categories,  but they stand) interpretation and then perverse disfigurement of someone else; culture.  ~~~  TL:DR:--  This place in Japan is a forest where people either go to kill themselves, or to look at the bodies of people who have killed themselves. It is a very sad and sacred place. To make a horror film about it - the poor sods that died in *that* way coming back to hurt others - is just fucking stupidly, ungodly, barbarically, ludicrously wrong and ridiculous.

This is how the normal story is:  Jess goes into the forest and is lost, Sara starts looking and meets Aiden who has already met Jess and hence he is greedy for the story to write article about. They go and from there on its just Sara's guilt and anxiety fudging her brain up with all the exhaustion and stress. In the cabin its all her imagination and to protect himself Aiden tries to play along but she kills him while still hallucinating that Jess is in the closet. She hallucinates everything after and cuts her wrist and then actually runs out. She does follow Jess but Jess is probably thinking she is also hallucinating and doesn't stop. Halfway, the blood loss takes over and Sara dies while Jess walks out. Also the last scene where Michi sees Sara is also probably his imagination because he remembers how Sara said she knows Jess is alive but this time he sees Jess give up and guesses Sara is dead causing him to imagine jer ghost. 🤷",1,0,Aproditi,6hW8hUcXR-A,0.016666666666666663,2020-01-04 16:30:19,False,False
