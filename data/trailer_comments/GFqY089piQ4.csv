For example Hercules would be awesome if you had a really strong man and his soldiers and friends trying to help cities and villages from monster attacks. These monsters though would be the last of real prehistoric species or people with mutations (from birth) like a huge man with one eye, giants, people with many hands and stuff/ I am pretty sure this is how mythology in every culture created. People saw monstrosities, abominations and prehistoric species,fossils and skeletons, natural events they could not explain so they had to name them, create spiritual connections, powerful entities so they could live hero prototypes for the next generations and a system of control in early societies.   As a Greek though I like the brute, beard, muscular Herakles this movie portrays. I know it will have a lot of CGI but staying true to the comic and as true as possible to the mythos, is what I wanna watch.

This movie really confuses me. Wouldn't it be more exiting if he was a demi God? I mean come on... This sounds so generic and boring. And i'm Sorry. I love The Rock and all. Hes good in a few movies. The Scorpion King was a great movie whit him in the lead. And i love him in Fast and Furious 5 and 6. But Hercules? Nah... That fake beard looks fake. It dosn't work on hes face. And the wig! Get that thing off... I won't mention the white teeth. Wops... This movie looks uninteresting. Boring! And bad... And that ducking voice over asking who he is was annoying as hell.
