(Zephaniah 2:3).  ***(Seek The Lord): This is the language of true (REPENTANCE), renewal, and regeneration.  ***(You will be hidden): Zephaniah used a play on words with meaning of his own name, ""Hidden in the Lord."" Even in the midst of the most calamitous judgment scenes, the mercy and grace of the Lord is still available to a (REPENTANT) people.  ***(Luke 13:3)<---Jesus)<---I tell you, Nay: but, except ye (REPENT), ye shall all likewise perish.  ***(Luke 5:32)<---(Jesus)<---I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to (REPENTANCE).  ***(2 Peter 3:9)<---The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to (REPENTANCE).  ***(Romans 2:4)<---Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you to (REPENTANCE?)  *** (REPENTANCE):  (Greek. Metanoia); Strong's #3341; This Greek word is a compound word derived from meta, meaning ""after"" and suggesting some type of change, and nous, meaning ""mind.""  Thus the word strictly denotes ""a change of mind."" But it also connotes remorse for sin, accompanied by a desire to turn away from one's sin, to God, for salvation. Both John the Baptist and Jesus began their ministries with a call to repentance. (See Matthew 3:2, 4:17)---A call that many of the social outcasts and ""sinners"" of that day answered, (See Luke 19:1-10), but that the religious people rejected. (Luke 11:39-44; 18:9-14).  (Jesus warning about HELL FIRE):  And if thy hand causes you to sin, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.  (Mark 9:43-44).  ***(Cut if off): Should be taken figuratively; it means to take whatever drastic action is necessary to avoid sin.  ***The imagery of Hell (Frequently called gehenna) comes from a garbage dump outside the walls of Jerusalem. Jesus hearers were familiar with the smoldering fires that always burned there.  ***(((Obedience))) and (((self-control))) are necessary to overcome sin.  ***The longing of the disciples for greatness needed to be reshaped according to God's purposes.",0,0,mlzanercik,0fvqnGmr9S8,0.07717391304347827,2017-07-20 19:23:29,True,True
