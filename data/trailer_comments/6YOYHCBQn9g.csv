2017-06-15T11:59:53,"I saw it, didn't like it. All it felt so empty that it felt like the movie was maybe 50 min when you watched it. There was no suspense, no horror, no scare. All the scary scenes are in this trailer. There was only one thing good about it, I'll put it in the spoiler.  *spoilers below*    Lost story short - Everyone gets infected and dies   More in-depth - cabin home with 3 people, 1 white guy and black woman and their son recently had to kill and burn the wife's grandpa because he go infected. Somehow he got infect but it is explained in the movie it is by contact. Anyways later on a person tries to break in and is captured, he explain him, his wife, and their kid are in a house next door, they need water so instead they decide to let them move in so they don't have to travel. Everything goes fine for a while and they get close and talk about their lives and what happened before the outbreak of the disease until the dog runs after something i the woods near the end of the movie. the dog is later found dead in front of the door and the door unlocked. it comes down to who did it. The child of the family that moved it was found lying on the group in a random room and the other kid helped him back in the room. The white guy with the black wife decides that everyone grab food and stay in their rooms separated for a couple days. it turns out the child is infect and the one family is pitted against the other eventually leading to all of the one family that moved in being killed by the other family but by them they are all exposed and they all die. the end.   Now for the interesting part. the part that makes it have that psychological thriller is ""did the child actually open the door"". I thought about it and if you think about it the child, even though it is portrayed in the movie that he must of opened the door and killed the dog because he was the first infected. If you think about all the events that happened, it is the black kid, the main protagonist, that might of been infected the entire time. He would constantly have nightmares of the disease and horrible things happening and these nightmares that wouldn't stop and they started after they killed the grandpa. so meaning instead of the protagonist helping the child, touching him when he helped him back to his room and got infected, it was in fact the protagonist that was infected and infected the kid. it is mentioned that the disease could take several days and time for it to appear and that in fact the protagonist might of just been more resistant to the disease. But because you never know, it's what pitted them against each other. What makes it more believable is the fact that the child couldn't of been able to open the door because it is too high and he didn't have the key were as the protagonist was tall enough and knew where the key was and had nightmares and possibly he was sleepwalking, part of the disease, and didn't realize he had killed the dog when it came back. It's possible he sees one thing when he was infected and so he just saw his dog take off but instead he had killed it. Then in one of his nights where he couldn't sleep he brought it back. That's the twist, who was the person that was really infected, the child of the family from the other house and the father lied about it to take care of his kid or the protagonist who was infected by the grandpa and didn't know it. With diseases and everyone affected differently and time to show signs, no one can know who patient zero truly was.   Now as interesting as that twist may have been, it was still not worth the price of a movie ticket. it literally had nothing to do with the night. other than possibly that the dark side affects of the disease start effecting people at night to go out at night and start causing them to do horrible things. But I was really hoping for something Blair witch style like something out in the woods was watching them and slowly finding a way to get inside and eventually does and leads them to have to high tail it out of their and run into the pitch black woods etc. that was more of what i was hoping for. all the scary scenes in the movie were just the protagonists dreams, or well nightmares.",0,0,Joseph Fergus,6YOYHCBQn9g,-0.0031269841269841257,2017-06-15 11:59:53,False,True

There was nothing redeeming about this movie, it was just depressing. The ending came too soon, there should have been more character development in my opinion and more leading up to the climax. I also feel like there should have been a different ending. There's no reason to make a film for the sake of being upsetting. This was fiction, not even a historical documentary or anything so there could have been at least one happy scene lol. I read an interview with the writer/creator and he talked about how his own grief inspired this movie. Ok, I get that it kind of helped you cope, but why do you want to create more macabre shit?

""Horror"" isn't the term I'd attach to this film, more like ""psychological thriller"". You get to see the impact of self-induced fear, paranoia and a lack of knowledge in its most extreme form. Very little answers are given, you're only left with fragmented information given by characters with a small grasp of reality around them, you can't even be sure that _they_ are reliable sources of information in this story. This film shows what happens when you don't know as much as you think, when trust breaks down, when you presume the worst, when fear takes over, and when you lose control of a dangerous situation. It's not about _being_ terrified by what you see, it's about how that fear controls your actions and makes you question everything.  Remember, the director wants the audience to fill in the gaps he left behind, to construct their own stories and allow the imagination to create the horror.

They meet up with a small family and they get infected because the child sleep walks and opens the door to interact with the infected dog.  The small family child (visitors) gets sick and decide they want to leave and take some food and water but do so at gun point.   The father of the house wrestles the gun and they go to the woods.  The father of the small family (visitors) overpowers the father of the family that owns the house and tries to beat him to death.  The wife of the homeowner shoots the man attacking her husband.  The wife and child of the small family (visitors) try to escape and are shot by the homeowner for no fucking reason.  They all get sick anyway and the last shot of the film is the husband and wife sitting at the table.  End credits.  No explanation, no sense.

What exactly was the point of this movie because I am so confused. Was it about how you lose all your humanity in such situations out of necessity to survive?  I think that's what most people would say in this movies defence but I honestly think that's a cheap excuse. Personally I think if they changed the title to something more fitting, stopped advertising the outbreak as some kind zombie thing and more of a deadly plague and stuck with the idea of a plague instead of tip-toeing around the zombie subject which literally did nothing but make the story that much more confusing and pointless. This might have been a good movie.  My biggest question is... WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG!?!? If this plague merely kills you (not zombify you), what the hell happened to that dog? What was he chasing? Why did he chase it? What killed him and why? The only explanation I can muster is bear. But in that case, what was the point and that's literally all you will think when you finish this movie.

It's not about the why and how of the infection, it's about (mis)trust and paranoia, and the actors carried the whole movie brilliantly. As for the title, well...  MINOR SPOILERS  1. The first time we see Will, he comes at night. 2. When the dog disappears, it comes back at night. 3. Travis' and Andrew's nightmares comes... well, at night.  I can understand people feeling let down by the lack of any explanation regarding the infection, and the lack of any actual storyline, but to me it kinda felt like Romero's Night of the Living Dead: it's not about the zombies or their origin story, it's about how people interact with each other in extreme situations, just as it is in this movie.  Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't perfect, and certainly isn't as good as Romero's NotLD. When Will and Paul go to get Will's wife and kid, it feels like there's missing footage. We don't even see Paul meeting Sarah and Andrew for the first time. That sucked. And the excessive amount of jumpscares. That sucked too. But overall, a pretty solid movie!

I loved how almost the entire movie took place in a single house, yet it felt so mysterious and interesting. 'Someone tell me whats going on?!'. The rest is a SPOILER, so be ware:   Yes, the movie gives a lot of hints and no obvious answers, but yet we all know what was going on. If you see the signs for what they are everything was quite obvious. Will lied to get his family safely into the house, maybe even already knew his boy was sick. Travis was probably sick from the beginning. He kept dreaming dreams about the affliction. (The other option is that his nightmares had no meaning at all, but who believes that). Everyone was already screwed right from the start, yet trying so hard to stay alive. Its the ultimate cynicism you could say. We're watching a group of people who are already doomed, trying to stave off their death, going through extreme lengths - even though it was inevitable right from the start. The ending was so ultimately cruel that it almost makes one laugh.

2019-06-12T18:42:38,"The title is a metaphor for fear and anxiety, which are a common occurrence at night. I think the film is brilliant, a very tense and scary examination of what some people will do to protect the ones they care about. It’s not false advertising, it’s just a metaphorical title. The acting is also brilliant, especially Joel Edgerton who gives one of the best performances of his career. Travis was most likely sick from the very beginning. They do say in the film that it only takes less than a day for symptoms to show. But if you really think about it, they are probably wrong and aren’t very aware of it. The nightmares and hallucinations Travis has are most likely due to the sickness. The dog is also sick, when you see the dog barking into the woods, there probably isn’t anything there. As the climax happens the aspect ratio closes in, kind of like the nightmares Travis has, his nightmares have become the stuff of reality. Also, when the other family is wanting to leave. They are concerned that Travis may be sick. As it’s implied he sleep walks, which has led many people to believe he’s the one who opened the door. As the film closes Travis dies and in the final shot, his family (who are most likely sick) what for their incoming fate. I personally love the film, it’s absolutely fine if you didn’t.
