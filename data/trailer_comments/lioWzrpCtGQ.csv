2015-06-28T04:04:12,"We have waited so very long for this. A lifetime really. Over the years that we waited, Brian Wilson's soul was made something like a meal for two man-eating monsters. First his late father Murry. Then the mad witch doctor Eugene Landy.  John Cusak has never been so riveting as Damaged Brian in the 80s. Paul Dano gently slaps us into a memory of the little-boyness of Brian in the moments when we had our first Beach Boy listens.   And later on the rescue--by the one who may have been Brian's Jesus. Or Mary perhaps. A seller of cars named Melinda Ledbetter. Conjured in the dazzling way of Elizabeth Banks.   The story unfolds in a way that made this viewer wonder how so much sadness might have been saved if we could only have born witness sooner.  The Gorgeous and the Awful live here as high-voltage neighbors. The perfect splash of the sun and the unseen closed-door Wilson family hurricane. We hear a semblance of the voices--both crazed and meticulously melodic--that played in Brian's skull for decades. And still play--in perhaps softer stanzas--to this day.  We're taken back to a late California night when the veteran session drummer Hal Blaine tells Brian that even though he's worked and played with Sinatra, Dean Martin, Phil Spector and so many more, that he hears in Brian's music strokes of genius not found before.   We get to eavesdrop as the Beach Boys talk about keeping up with the Beatles in the moment of Rubber Soul. We're in on the birth of Brian's ""pocket symphony""-- the one that made house calls at nine studios before it was a wrap--called Good Vibrations.   We hear Boy Brian move into deeper water...and ""Surf''s Up.""   As the warm season peaks again over America, we at long last get a seat near the stage of the Endless Summer.  Too close not to be stunned by the golden hue of the glory. And too near to miss the jab of the deep blue of the often terrible hurt.",0,0,jim bleikamp,lioWzrpCtGQ,0.11004261363636358,2015-06-28 04:04:12,False,True

2015-10-03T00:32:00,"I've just seen this movie hours ago and I'm still blown away. Seriously, this movie is a masterpiece of narrative, acting and emotion. The whole cast is terrific, but Paul Dano gives one the best performances I've seen in the whole year. For real, he was snubbed by the Oscars for There will be blood but snubbing him away would be unforgivable. He gives such a real, complex and brutally honest performance of someone alienated and haunted by his own disease but also someone naive and innocent who's manipulated. It's a character you can feel real, you feel sorry for him but also you can relate to his pain and most of all you feel so powerless. You want to save him all the time and at the same time you can see he's a genius. It's truly a depth and unique performance that cannot be missed. Same with Elizabeth Banks, always underrated, who makes something amazing with an ""easy"" role. She's not only the love interest, she gives her character a charisma and an strenght trought the whole movie wich also deserves a nomination. She really captures that feeling of trying desperatly to save someone you love, the frustation of being unable to do anything. Cusack is fantastic too, like a little, innocent boy in the body of an old, beated man.  This movie is outstanding in so many ways, really shows what it is to isolated and misunderstood.

2015-10-23T16:33:12,"Honestly I think this is the best biopic I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot, especially of rock stars. I was initially skeptical because of the Dano/Cusack split but the director explained it in a way that seemed brilliant --- basically the ""Paul Dano Brian"" disappeared when he ""went to bed"" (had his mental breakdown and became a recluse for years), and the person who eventually emerged from the heartbreak and wreckage was a different person, symbolized by the switch to Cusack as older Brian. We all know that Dano, already a phenomenal actor at such a young age, hits a home run here, nailing every aspect of the young Brian, his walk, his slouch (he was self-conscious as he stood 6'3""), the patterns of his speech. But I have to say that Cusack does some of the very best acting of his career in this film. I had forgotten honestly that he can act with such subtlety and conviction. He gets at the ""soul"" of the later Brian, a man who has experienced tremendous loss, in a more quiet way than Dano, and it is also brilliant and devastating. Banks is also excellent -- she conveys a tremendous amount of strength and integrity as an ordinary woman caught up in an extraordinary story.",9,0,aleister crowley,lioWzrpCtGQ,0.2709876543209876,2015-10-23 16:33:12,False,False

And with Most movies like this that you see these days, the actors did not even look close to the real people in the band. Mike Love stood out the best when they picked the actor for this movie. I read years ago that Brian was actually held captive by a doctor that kept him away from close friends and family, right? That part of the movie I got. But the rest of it was too much going back and forth from childhood to present day. And was actually confusing to watch at times. I guess I was expecting more of a Beach Boys movie from beginning to end of their careers. But now I know it was mainly about Brian's problems. Again, Sad life he had.
