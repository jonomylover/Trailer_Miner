I have loved this franchise since the beginning...are some better than others sure but i think you can say that about any franchise that goes on for awhile...

I see every RE movie in theatre with my Mom and she likes to watch all courageous stunts being performed by Milla.   Many times movies dont succeed or generate revenues. RE has big fan following I am sure. For my entire family, RE movies are beyond criticism or rating. We treat these as complete package for family entertainment. Moreover, Milla resides in every single lady today who inspires them to be courageous.   All people should salute Milla for an inspiring essence that she has been giving since release of RE's first installment. We should respect the hidden msg. and morale that we get from movie. RE is beyond comparison. I wish this year's Oscar Academy Award goes to her and Paul for their efforts.   Despite of fact that, RE is an action packed, horror movie I get positive fighting spirit from it especially, Milla's never give up attitude while facing different challenges, situations and phases of life.  I wish that, I personally meet her to thank her and Paul for their never ending efforts and I also look forward to have chains of movies in RE series. If I can participate, act, play or contribute for this I'll be highly obliged.

2017-02-19T21:46:29,I really loved 1-5 but this trailer is awful and most likely the movie will be awful.I was so hoping for them to start it off right where they ended the 5th one at the white house taking a last stand to defend what's left of the human race and was looking forward to her trying to protect her new adoptive daughter she found from the 5th one and her using her powers since she got them back but from the trailer I see none of that just her going back to raccoon city and the only real interesting thing is her saying we're going to kill them all.Come on hollywood quit trying to be cheap but that will never happen.What a disappointing trailer i'll see the movie and give it a shot but i'll most likely be let down,0,0,Alex Chaos2030,hfby7XwoBl0,0.0798169666590719,2017-02-19 21:46:29,False,True
