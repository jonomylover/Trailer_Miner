2019-05-25T15:43:55,"wasn't too bad a movie & it had a few funny and true to life moments (the ratings make it look like it was pure trash). it was pretty unrealistic (to one who has hiked it) as others have pointed out at times. their packs don't show any wear and look like they weigh nothing (empty, so the 70 year old actors can throw them around with ease), they carry trekking poles the whole time but never use them (not even a throw away line to explain why not), the maps are inaccurate, and its an odd mixture of ""modern"" gear from when the movie came out and ""old"" gear from when the real Bill Bryson would have been on the trail (90's). also, no mention of shaving or haircuts, they don't have to replace any of their gear, and no mention of the potheads and other weird people you meet on the trail (other than the one annoying woman who I guess stands in for them all). also, why don't they ever use the shelters? (we see one in the background and an empty one for the ""map gag"" scene). if you never hiked the AT, this is probably just going to come across as another road movie with grumpy old men.",0,0,XSC 3,cOF2LIAp9bw,-0.06761904761904762,2019-05-25 15:43:55,False,False
