But I'm betting if you saw the Dave Chapelle show then you've seen Knee-high park skit,funny as hell. Ease up on being PC,and trying to shame people who don't fit what you feel is right.Very arrogant to assume HENSON didn't have this vision of Muppets,just because he didn't do it don't mean it didn't cross his mind,just the culture during his time wouldn't have it. Look at the shows from the Muppet show era,think All in the family by title was a wholesome show about family?
