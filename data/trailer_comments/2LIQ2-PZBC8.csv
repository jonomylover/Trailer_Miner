And then, First Class and DoFP are practically finally using the ideas of the suits Jean and Scott were wearing in the one concept art for the first film. No hypocrisy there at all!  I woulda loved to see uniform versions of their suits, but instead, we got those bland, shiny pile of wrinkles that would cramp up easy at the joints, preventing mobility and higher octane action (at least in X-Man at the time, though leather barely has any elasticity at all, anyhow).

The Guardians of the Galaxy really are great characters and it's about time they had a spotlight.  So far, all the characterizations looks spot-on and Chris Pratt already has me sold as Starlord.

2014-05-26T17:26:16,"At 1:16 is that Knowhere? Going to let my brain go all storming here, stay with me on this:  1: We see Knowhere at 1:16, the severed head of a Celestial, it serves a scientific station for many races of the universe and is also known for being the headquarters of a certain super hero group that deals with galactic level threats..  2: On an AMC interview, James Gunn and Kevin Feige are asked about Cosmo and they said we had to wait for the movie. In the comics, Cosmo resides in Knowhere and aids the Guardians and the Annihilators.  3: There is a call sheet that was leaked mentioning a scene where Star Lord flirts with Ti Asha Ra ( who might be the yellow alien seen on 0:44 ) and we all know that she is Beta Ray Bill's girlfriend/love interest (they are the last of their species).  4: Nathan Fillion, in a recent convention was asked about wanting a role in Guardians of the Galaxy and he teased the fact that he was in at least one scene (which might be in a cameo) But with Nathan's looks, I can quite easily imagine him being Quasar (or Nova) in a cameo/post credit scene.  5: Ronan is already in this movie.  6: It is quite possible for them to introduce Shi'ar (the race Gladiator belongs to) in this movie as well  7: No Silver Surfer because of copyright issues, bummer, but can be worked around (they could add a Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (possibly as a S.W.O.R.D. liaison if they go the A:EMH route on her story)).  Some of you might have already understood where I might be going with this. The Annihilators. The cosmic heavy hitters. A team created mostly because Star Lord felt like the issues that needed to be tackled head on needed more fire power than what the Guardians of the Galaxy ever could have (imagine Guardians being the sneaky, under the radar field operators and Annihilators as the space cavalry, the space Avengers).We have their base and already a big part of the crew semi accounted for if these turn out the way I imagine.  What I always hoped they would do was, introduce Beta Ray Bill in Thor 3, where they could go with a brother themed movie (which they love doing in Thor movies and they are right to do so) where Thor meets Beta Ray Bill (who in the comic books become ""Oath Brothers"" as they say it) and it creates an amazing spin to the whole Thor-Loki sibling rivalry, where Thor realizes that Beta Ray bill might be more of an actual brother to him than Loki ever was.  So, since they have not planned a Guardians sequel already, if this movie does well, they might want to open up the Annihilators route to tell epic space battle of immensely powerful beings. A space battle, but without the need of spaceships. Wouldn't it be awesome?  Again, even if this idea even occurred to Marvel, it is still way down the road, easily at least 3 to 4 years. Since they would have to see if this movie does well before they can even start laying the ground work. But Guardians of the Galaxy might be an amazing stepping stone to put up before going all turbo into the Marvel outer space lore.  Also, it is possible that the team gets created in a Guardians of the Galaxy sequel, where the problem they would need to solve would require the Annihilators on one hand and them on the other hand, working hand in hand in a movie called something like ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Annihilation"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Annihilators""  Any of you people that might possibly have other info that might make this more plausible?﻿",0,0,AtabeyGaming,2LIQ2-PZBC8,0.14460317460317462,2014-05-26 17:26:16,True,True

Of course a Racoon and an Tree aren't mainstream hero designs, most are used to purely humanoid characters and have never read comics or manga's that dare to break away from that limited design pool.   At this stage of Marvels phases, GotG will serve as a potential hit for fans of the comics, and marvel crossover events, and an unlikely success to most audiences, but regardless of whether it's a hit or miss won't have an effect on Marvel's Avengers cast who'll be the main focus in the crossover movie anyway. ",3,0,Puck,2LIQ2-PZBC8,0.07245670995670996,2014-06-21 13:29:10,True,True

Marvel has a great lineup of villains; they just haven't utilized them as they should. The Winter Soldier was rather boring (not the movie, the actual person), but to be fair, he was brainwashed by Hydra. Malekith, on the other hand, was pathetic and weak with little to no character development. Loki has a great demeanor and appeal - he's probably my favorite Marvel villain - but his plans don't make much sense. Red Skull was one of the only Marvel villains that I really couldn't critique much - I enjoyed him immensely. Unfortunately, Hugo Weaving said he did not enjoy playing the role, so we probably won't see him again. As for the infamous Mandarin twist, I was actually fine with that, especially now that we know there's a REAL Mandarin. All the villains beside these varied in memorableness (that's not a word, but oh well), but I hope Ronan will be used in a great way. The movie looks awesome, and I'll definitely go see it.

The Tesseract from Avengers and The Aether from Thor 2 are definitely Infinity Gems, and the blue stone in Loki's staff may or may not be the mind gem. In the Thor 2 credits scene, the Aether was given to The Collector (Benecio Del Toro), who appears in this film. Whoever collects all six infinity stones and puts them in the infinity gauntlet attains godlike power. Thanos is seeking this. You can see him in the credits of The Avengers. The character Drax has a vendetta against Thanos for killing his family, and the character Gamora was raised by Thanos to be a living weapon. Both of them want Thanos dead. Marvel is building towards Thanos getting the Infinity Gauntlet, and when that happens, we may even get to see The Guardians of The Galaxy do a crossover and play a role in an Avengers movie...",1,1,sans,2LIQ2-PZBC8,-0.06666666666666667,2014-07-14 22:17:44,True,True

But as the movie went on, he turned out to be such a cutie. #dancingGroot I can't say that this movie was better then Averagers. I'm also not saying it was a bad movie.

Every Marvel fan on Earth would probably unite to physically stop the thing from coming out. It'd be the world's first fanboy coup, the Million Marvel March. Every superhero and villain costume ever made would be seen that day. And they would not be seen for nothing, for every child under 5 and retarded one over, would oppose them, determined to experience in full the hijinks of a cute little wise-cracking CGI bank robber. For the first time ever, Marvel fans would call for aid, and DC fans would answer. Nerd basements everywhere would turn into time travel thinktanks overnight, all the top minds gathering to come up with a plan to Terminator back and prevent the ink from ever hitting the paper.

For one thing, there seems to be extra scenes and voice overs that were incorporated into the ad to create the ultimate badass trailer for this film. While they don't contradict the story line at all, looking back, its like seeing deleted scenes that fit in between the plot lines.   The choice of using Norm Greenbaum's spirit in the sky was a stroke of genius, it fits perfectly with mood, the lyrics are appropriate, it's classic like all the other songs in the soundtrack, and its just a downright badass song. But it wasn't in the movie. Perhaps they didn't have use for it beyond the trailer, but it could be used in the sequel. Brilliant advertising. In fact if anything I thought this movie was going to be more of a 9/10 because of the ads, ultimately I feel 8/10 is more appropriate. That said, I love the characters and the world they created.
