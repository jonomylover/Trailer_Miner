The Housing Bubble in 4 Easy Steps SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 Mark Thornton  1. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to as low as 1% so that after inflation we had negative interest rates.  2. As a result, mortgage rates fell to an all time low.  3. Low rates caused borrowing and lending to explode, particularly in real estate. For example, commercial banks more than doubled the amount of real-estate loans they made.  4. All these low interest loans had to be extended to people with worse credit ratings and this increased the demand for homes and other real-estate assets. It should not be surprising that home prices skyrocketed. Click on the link below to the Real Estate Roller Coaster:  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, mortgage-backed securities, and credit derivatives were simply the conduit that made all these bad loans and investments seem less risky than they really were. In this manner the Federal Reserve can fool the market, at least temporarily.

2015-09-23T22:21:16,"THE BANKS GOT GREEDY.  Uh, yeah. Just remember it was the federal government that passed legislation requiring the banks to make loans they would otherwise not have made, all in the interest of ""helping"" people get into houses they couldn't afford. The banks happily went along with it because the federal government GUARANTEED those loans with PUBLIC MONEY.  The fact that these ridiculous loans were undersigned by the general public via the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT in the event of a collapse is what fueled the ""greed"" - making it possible for banks to hand out loans like candy, repackage and sell those loans by virtue of a FULL ASSURANCE OF THEIR SOLVENCY BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, and make a killing for them AND THEIR CRONIES IN POLITICS in the process.   Of course the whole thing had to come crashing down, but blaming it merely on the ""greed"" of the banks is a great way for us to do it all again. FOR THE WHOLE PROCESS CONTINUES. The Federal Reserve is corrupt. The government ""management"" of the economy is corrupt. We are in another bubble RIGHT NOW due to the government artificially inflating a bubble via their manipulation of our currency. It is NOT more regulation that is needed - it is a TRUE FREE MARKET removed from the machinations of government, wherein money is treated like any other good or service and banks must be responsible for the loans they make - NOT GUARANTEED A government handout! (Also, fraud is fraud and is always prosecutable- which is a process that is more transparent and effective in a TRUE FREE MARKET.)  THIS PROBLEM STARTS WITH OUR GOVERNMENT. If people do not see the proper cause-and-effect then we have learned NOTHING from the recent economic meltdown and will be destined to repeat it again and again, each time shaking our heads like children about ""greed"" when we continually fail to see the real source of the problem.  One more thing. It wasn't just a guy who ""gets his hair cut at supercuts and doesn't wear shoes"" who could see the collapse coming- IT WAS THE ENTIRE SCHOOL OF AUSTRIAN ECONOMISTS. Only these are NOT the economists in power. The Austrian school promotes a fair and prosperous system, not the sort of currency manipulation and devious legislation beloved by the politicians and their crony capitalist partners who run the show and have an utter disdain for the common person.  A good primer on the events covered in this movie is Tom Wood's book ""Meltdown.""  The American people need to wake up to the fraud that is the COLLUSION between government and big banks, bankers should be prosecuted, nefarious legislation limiting the proper functioning of the market removed, economically ignorant, greedy politicians should be replaced and the Federal Reserve should be dealt with.   I hope this film reveals at least some of the actual dynamics at work to create this crisis, but I doubt it will. The scumbags who have created this mess are able to continue in power in part by their control of the media. They have had an overwhelming influence in shaping public opinion on this, getting the average person to attribute our economic woes to ""greedy bankers"" and a ""lack of legislation"" - and thereby escaping the corrections that would jeopardize their power!",165,95,Curia Regis,vgqG3ITMv1Q,0.12061202686202686,2015-09-23 22:21:16,True,True

They could have done many things to alert the public, regulators, politicians, media. But they, in the end made millions off it. I don't think they're any better than the bankers and rating agencies that caused the problem (and many others). But the movie tricks you, or at least it did me, into rooting for them. According to the movie, the one character, Mark Baum, made some weak attempts, perhaps the book better describes this, at talking to the media and the rating agencies. But if they all had put as much energy into warning everyone as they did making money off it, I'm sure there voices would have eventually made a difference.

2016-10-21T14:09:10,"Liked this movie a lot. Reminds you, ""Trust no one.""   I also nominate it for WORST drumming in film history by an actor. I'm in shock there was a drumming coach. Somebody got ripped off. He's playing the Mastodon song at half speed, and at the kit, it's technically correct, but it looks REALLY, REALLY bad. Extremely ham-handed, like he's wearing boxing gloves.   MUCH better drumming in The Rocker and The Gene Krupa Story.   So is Scott Wittenberg a really bad teacher, or is the actor just not listening? I'm going with bad teaching.  Any new drummer should know how to find the tempo with the snare and not to play like you're in a body cast. 90+% of that is just loosen up your hands and body. You don't need to be tense, it just makes the drums sound like crap. I learned that from Bernard Purdie (Steely Dan) and watching the hands of some of the best players in existence.   I was so distracted by the awful sounding drums, I didn't even notice what they were, or if they were even tuned. I think Evans heads makes them sound like garbage, but I'm sure sound guys love them because they're flat as hell.

2017-01-03T04:44:53,"Read ""Bull by the Horns.""  This was the biggest financial fraud in modern history.    First the banksters invented and pushed toxic mortgage programs that were destined, if not designed, to fail or require costly refinances setting up a self-perpetuating cycle of even more fees. Examples were interest only, negative amortization, no tax and insurance escrows, no qualifying, and teaser low beginning interest rates - all promoted with a wink and a nod:  “Don't worry, if it gets tough, we'll just refinance you into another lower rate.""  Unsuspecting borrowers pushed to the bankster/realtor controlled lender and title company had no one to look out for their interest.  They believed the sales pitch and signed up.  An inherently dangerous product was sold to the public as safe - much like the unsafe-at-any-speed Chevrolet Corvair.  Evidence now suggests that a majority of the sub-prime loans were made to people who would have qualified for a decent loan but were pushed into the more-profitable, but toxic, sub-prime.   Second, the banksters packaged this garbage into bonds, paid for a AAA rating, then sold the stinking poo to unsuspecting investors while retaining the lucrative servicing rights and senior positions for themselves.   Third, the banksters developed a scheme (MERS) that was supposed to keep track of the swirl of paperwork as they whipped these loans and bonds around the world while defrauding local courts of millions of dollars in transfer taxes. Talk about tax evasion!  Lastly, when the whole thing unravels, the banksters have lost the paperwork, don't know who owns what, can't understand how it all went so wrong and won't negotiate to help people keep their homes.",0,0,Craig Buck,vgqG3ITMv1Q,-0.008201058201058195,2017-01-03 04:44:53,False,False

Looking for work, I met with a hedge fund guy I knew from a few years back who had personally made over 100m (lord knows how many billions his company made) from short selling pretty much the entire housing market and the entire NYSE. He was high on cocaine and was wouldn't stop complaining to me that Gulfstream were delaying the delivery of his brand new private jet due to setbacks. They couldn't care less about the economy or people losing their jobs, all this dick cared about was his private jet amid the chaos. At my peak I was making 200k a year, this jag off had just made 100 million dollars personally and told me to go fuck myself. It made me so mad I threw his cocaine off his scarface-themed glass table and his personal bodyguard (only major jag offs have bodyguards) kicked me out. It was a rough year but then fortunately, Goldman Sachs had bribed enough politicians by giving them millions for making 2 minute speeches that Congress actually bailed the fuckers out by giving them taxpayer money. If my boss had ""donated"" enough money to those crooks in Washington, Lehman would be trading today.
