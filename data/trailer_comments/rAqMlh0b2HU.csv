And emilys disappearance is just one short part of the book which all the build up to it was good but after many revelations after that it started to suck. Characters started to become more n more stupid like unrealistic. Like unhuman reactions and incredible stupid n naive. Im just gonna say that it revolves around life insurance and it was epic fail to be this incredible  big twist revelation. I kept waiting n reading that the ending would tie everything together. But no instead it was left with plot holes. The movie seems to have changed out a few things and adding and leaving out characters from the book.

The wealthy, judgmental, controlling father psychologically abuses the beautiful twins Faith and Hope, accusing them of murdering their sister Charity in the womb, and tries to force them into good behavior by keeping them away from partying with friends as teenagers, which only motivates them to think of doing him in. The exasperated mother in later years says that they were born bad and, ""what haven't they done?!"" Still, in contrast, Hope and Faith were the happiest in the sticks among seemingly less sophisticated people at Bible camp, where the children are happy and smiling, since they hear the contrasting original Bible message about how special, loved, wanted, good, forgiven and faultless they are in their heavenly father's eyes. Paralleling a criticism of the traditional church, Charity couldn't even survive birth into the family, Faith abandoned Hope and decided to live on her own, ragged, struggling, and detached, before threatening to bankrupt Hope and kill her child. Everyone ""always knew Hope was the alpha"", and Hope ultimately believes she must destroy ragged Faith in order to get out of her own debt and protect her child, the continuation of hope into the future. Hope's husband says that Hope is an enigma, since, ""you can get close to her but never really feel like you can reach her"".",2,0,Joni Chamberlain,rAqMlh0b2HU,0.2259585652442795,2018-12-31 18:46:29,False,False
