I am sure the character must be in the novel but even if we remove the character from this story, I can't see any major changes in the storyline or impact on other character's story. In fact for me it will be more pure if she fell in love with William without having an existing relationship. Its just my opinion cos I think lately in every movie its like one of the two leads is already in the relationship and then they fall for someone else.

I will donate everything to the ""Yellow Ribbon"" to prevent others to commit euthanasia.  And give the fund to any medical research discovery to cure any spinal cord injury.  My Mother has an elephantiasis since 1968.  If she had chosen to just end her life, because she no longer wants to suffer and be a burden to others, we wouldn't be here.  Other people may find my life worth ending, but I was raised to believe that for as long as you live there is ""HOPE"".  Israel's national anthem is HaTikva.  The HOPE.  Can you imagine that there are people to this day with a mentality that euthanasia is a mercy killing.  I agree with Lou's Mother.  If Clarke truly loves Will she wouldn't go to Switzerland to support his desire to end the life of pain and sufferings for being in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
