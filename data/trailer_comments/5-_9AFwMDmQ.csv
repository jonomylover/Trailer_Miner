When he gives notice that he is leaving her employ for California, she realises how important he has become to her well-being. That night, she goes alone to visit him in his cottage, to find out why he is deserting her. Pressed, he reluctantly reveals that it is because people have been injuring her good name by gossiping that he wants to marry her. She exclaims that it is ""...too absurd – too soon – to think of, by far!"" He bitterly agrees that it is absurd, but when she corrects him, saying that it is only ""too soon"", he is emboldened to ask once again for her hand in marriage.

I loved the book, and I love David Nicholls who wrote the screenplay (and his adaptation of Tess of the D'Urburvilles) so I was really let down. The pastoral aspects of the book are translated really well to screen, the casting of the main characters is perfect (Tom Sturridge is better than the Frank Troy I imagined), but the film rattles through the plot far too quickly, and cut out pivotal moments. Martin Sheen is one of our best living actors: so use him! No moments are left to linger long enough, Bathsheba's emotional turmoil over her actions barely considered, and the final chapter of the book insultingly omitted. I'd say if you hadn't read the book you'd have a bit of trouble following.

This led to a whole new set of problems that her books describe, and with great class, taste, and in few words.
