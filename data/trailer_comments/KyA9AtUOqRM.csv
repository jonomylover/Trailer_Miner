2016-01-08T21:25:11,"The Conjuring is one of the best Horror movies in years. Horror movies these days aren't horror movies anymore. They seem to think that throwing a bunch of stupid and pointless jump scares at you left and right is all they need to do. Sorry, jump scares aren't what you consider scary. It's just something unexpected and it turns on a very natural human reaction wich is built into us to keep us alive. It isn't scary... A true horror movie can actually scare people without any of that BS. Personally i can't say horror movies scare me. But they still give me that creepy wibe wich i enjoy alot. So i'm still able to tell a good one from a stupid one. The Conjuring was a good one! It didn't rely on Jump Scares. Sure there are things in the movie that can make you jump. But really, there aren't any jump scares as in all of a sudden BOOOOH! And then it was nothing really... Horror movies do that. They give you a ton of Jump scares that aren't even relevant to the actual story. Like BOOOH oh fuck Mike i didn't see you! Oh i was just getting a glass of milk. Like that stupid shit. And then you got those ghosts that just need to jump on screen with a loud sound of some sort. Just why? The Conjuring was a inteligent and good horror film. It was well acted and actually creepy.   Let's hope this one can deliver that.... But honestly i don't expect much because the few times we get a good or decent horror film they find a way to fuck it up with the sequel. Like Sinister... The first one was briliant. If you ignore that fucking retarded ending.... The movie was briliant. And then you have the sequel.... Let's just pretend that never happened. It's the trap any good horror film goes into these days. The first one is great and so the sequel does everything that the first one didn't. And that was to avoide all the bad shit that doesn't make a good horror film. It's so annoying.... The first one proves that they got their shit straight. And then they make a sequel and they do everything that reviewers praised them for NOT doing. ''Great, they made a amazing horror film with e interesting story and great acting. And it didn't rely on Jump Scares!'' So what do they do with the sequel ''Let's just write some silly story and cast some shit actors just to have some people to fuck with and jam as many jump scares into the film as possible. Let's even give the milk man a jump scare... He delivered Soya Milk instead of real milk.... BOOOOH!''. This is why Good horror films shouldn't have sequels. I'm gonna check this one out tough. Let's hope it's actually one of thsoe good sequels.",0,0,Monkey Powerkey,KyA9AtUOqRM,0.08597845804988662,2016-01-08 21:25:11,True,True

""Do you know when the voice is going to speak?"" ""Sometimes""  Ok, that is intrigue.  ""Does it ever say things just to you? That you can only hear"" ""Yes""  Okay, 1) who asks that about voices in someone's head? Either the doctor needs to ask something else or elude to a previous conversation. If the later then 2) why didn't the girl up the intrigue and fear with ""Don't you hear him too?"" to elude to how real that voice is to her.  ""Does it feel like it is coming from inside of you?"" ""more like it is coming from behind me.....""  Odd but understandable question from the doctor and the shift from inside to behind does up the intrigue again......  "".....like I am being used"".  OOOOoooo, swing and a miss! You made me stop believing it (partially because those two sentences don't work {behind me=using me?}) is a more powerful supernatural force and started rolling 20 sided dice.

2016-03-27T21:56:10,I have so much respect for the people that do these movies based on the Warren's cases. HOWEVER they only visited this family and didn't exorcise anything. It was merely a vist  . Now Hollywood has taken actually story of Enfield Poltergeist and turned it into the conjuring 2 (absolutely no relation to the first ) and made loads of stuff up that DIDN'T happen. There have been so many genuine people from UK Police to press that covered this story and witnessed activity that science couldn't explain. Unfortunately the makers of this have let us down completely. They have probably not even spoken with the girl it happened to (janet) and I fail to see how they could wreck an already horrifying story that many people in the UK know about .They have gone Hollywood adding crap itinerary the story for people to be scared. If people knew the actual story and saw the footage etc THAT is scary. To turn it into the Conjuring is insulting to the people who went through it and the men who tried to tell the world what happened. I'd be highly concerned that the directors and producers who made this thought it was okay to make events up for entertainment purposes and pass it off as true. It's Movies like this that make sufferers of Paranormal activity even more unbelieve to people who already mock them.  I feel let down by John Zaffis if he parted information to the film makers on behalf of the Warren's.,0,0,Urban Angel,KyA9AtUOqRM,-0.07178743961352656,2016-03-27 21:56:10,True,True

Again, it might be interesting if the Warner Bros. personnel took advice from serious occultists. Excluded, of course, would be people like the heads of the Church of Satan who do enochian magick not having anything traditional of there own or those mild mannered mystics from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn being too weak willed to do anything but the lower magick.

2016-06-09T23:45:56,"THE CONJURING 2 - Movie Commentaries & Reviews by: Alvin Sebetero Spoiler Level : VERY MINIMAL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The very 1st Conjuring movie made a very huge impact around the globe and many people even considered it as the Best Horror movie in history, including myself. So, the moment that they announced that the sequel will happen, expectation from people is really high. And how did the sequel did? --- I believe it certainly did very well too. I never expected the sequel to be so good. I don't want to compare which is best among the two because both are two different stories but the movies are both beautifully made and beautifully executed. What I loved about the sequel are: * The Characters - For both movies, what makes the Conjuring really good is how they were able to make the viewers feel connected with the Warren couples and the family involved. Every character in this sequel played their role perfectly. * The Story - The flow of the story is very clean and very detailed. The fact that it is based on a true story made it even better. And actually, the movie was very, very realistic when it comes to how they act to situations. There are very emotional moments that made me tear a little. There are funny moments, romantic moments and a lot of well-executed shock and terrifying moments. Another story that made me emotional is the story of the spirit of Bill Wilkins, it will make everyone realize the sadness of unexpected death. * The Values - This may be a horror movie, I would suggest this to be viewed by the whole family even the children. There are a lot of values to be learned such as valuing each members of your family and no matter what happen, be strong and fight for each other. The importance of life and how we should appreciate each and every moment. This movie is really unexpected for a horror movie. You will come out of the cinema happy and will definitely say, ""What I paid for is all worth it"" and I myself would even watch it again. The best moment is experiencing it with other viewers in the cinema. I never experienced the viewers to react that way and how loud they screamed, all the cursing and the reactions. It only shows that the movie is very, very effective and warning --- it may consume all your energy.",18,9,Alvin Sebetero,KyA9AtUOqRM,0.2956322751322751,2016-06-09 23:45:56,False,True

Also, some questions might sound a little dumb, so don't mind me.

(It's not like, ""Hey, this is my name, you can use it to kill me."" MEH -_-) 4 How did the Demon possess Bill? (I mean it makes sense if she possesses human, but possesses the same spirit?

If you ask me whether The Conjuring 2 is scary, HELL NO. The story line is nice but the movie is literally not scary as you think. Especially when the fictional ghost called ""Stick man"" spoilt the whole thing & made the movie less scary. And the movie was really really draggy. Even my mum can say this was a rubbish movie and wasn't scary. I would recommend anyone to watch The Conjuring instead of this because that movie was 10/10 & extremely scary. I can proudly say this because it's much much more logic & you really feel the impact when watching the conjuring 1.

Thing is, I slept in the movie theater, not because I was bored, but because it was the very last session and very late, like 23pm. Besides, I wish I hadn't drank beforehand. I actualy came to this trailer to remember the plot, I even wondered if I had watched this movie. I couldn't remember anything before watching the trailer now. But now I remember the pseudo-nun demon figure and it was scary as fuck. But my advice is, if you're going to watch a movie that's supposed to mess with your fellings, like when watching a terror movie, don't mess with your brain, like, by drinking. It'll take the fun away.

These typical hollywood storys where shit starts to move in the house, real scary.... it just doesn't work for me anymore, since i was 14. From all the horror movies that came out in 2016 about 0 were good. I watch a shit ton of movies, you could say i'm a real movie geek, and i really appriciatee good movies, it's just that i expect the next step from movies not the same hollywood shit over and over. You know give me a few million bucks, even though i'm no producer, and i will make you the most fucked up mindfucking movie that you'll ever see, imo a good horror movie takes a mind that CAN think of really fucked up things and think outside the box, i specificly would focus on the psychological aspect, make normal people say things that are so creepy and not making sense, with a really creepy athmosphere  and story, that's what a good horror is about. A pretty good example is the radio scene from White Noise, that's real horror. I'm not bullshitting around when i say i could write a fucked up movie, i've thought about it many times, you'll need 10 min in the cinema before u come out crying. Do you guys know the video I Feel Fantastic on YT? You think that was creepy? well i didn't i thought it was fucking stupid, it's another example of how creeped out people can get by things that don't make sense, i would bring it to a whole new level, all i need is a few nice joints, that's when i'm most creative. BTW my real hero when it comes to psychological movies is Steven Spielberg, even though it's not really horror, some roles like the guy from Close Encounters Of the Third Kind, did creep me out because of the way he was acting. some of his movies are a good example of which direction i would go in my movies, but 100x as bad.",0,0,Jeremy Jk,KyA9AtUOqRM,0.048327020202020204,2016-09-24 15:50:52,False,False
