2013-11-04T13:54:35,Look your focusing on the previous trilogy. First Class was supposed to be a restart for the NEW X Men Series. They should have left the old previous films behind. Then there wouldn't be a problem with her or Cyclops dead. If they stayed away from the previous films and created a NEW reality/universe that way there would be no continuity problems. It's because Singer and Fox changed things. Kitty could then be written in as she Joined the X Men around 13 and bring in some other characters.,0,0,BlackBauer007,pK2zYHWDZKo,-0.054752066115702484,2013-11-04 13:54:35,True,True

So, it's like there is some kind of setup of Erik (Magneto), and he ends up in prison for  assisting in the assassination of Kennedy. Basically, Magneto turns himself in and in court, he should what he can do and tells everyone that he didn't kill him, that he knows who did but they'll, quote ""never catch them. She has a way of hiding in plain sight."" End quote. So, Wolverine's going to back to warn them and get them back together and  go stop or kill off someone before the war ever starts, before people really knew about them. There's some kind of conspiracy alongside the conspiracy of Kennedy or something like that, some kind of set up of Magneto.

2013-12-05T02:58:05,"The Correct X-Men Movie Storyline Order  1. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" When Mutants First Appeared, Logan and his Brother were born and Emma Frost was Young as well as Cyclops. Then this was the story of how a War was about to Start  between Mutants and Humans over who will rule the earth. 2. ""X-Men: First Class"" The Birth of Charles and Erik Aka. Professor X & Magneto and this was the beginning of a War between Mutants and Humans. Also how Cerebro was founded and was given that name then The Mutants came to The Mansion to Harness their skills and live life their. Also to start a School there while finding other Mutants. Also how ""The Brotherhood of The Mutants"" were born after Magneto turned Evil 3. ""X-Men"" ""Charlies"" and ""Erik"" grew old after an old flash back of ""Erik's"" terrible past and then ""Rogue"" appeared and she kissed a boy and almost killed him. Then This was the beginning of a raging battle between the ""X-Men"" vs ""The Brotherhood"" while trying to prevent a War ""Charlies"" never wanted. The we had an Asshole named ""Senator Kelly"" who tried to expose all the humans for being very dangerous. Also ""Magneto"" tried to turn Humans into Mutants The ""X-Men"" beaten ""The Brotherhood"" and put ""Magneto"" in ""Prison"".  4. ""X-Men 2: United"" The War Started with the fake ""Senator Kelly"" impersonated by ""Mystique"" and Also ""Logan"" was falling more in Love with ""Gene"". When thing really got out of hand when ""Logan's"" old boss ""Striker"" showed up after attacking ""The Mansion"". Then tried ""Striker"" took over The Mansion and then tried to get ""Professor X"" killed by his strong mind bending son. Then that's when both the ""X-Men"" and ""Brotherhood"" teamed up and went to a Damn and took down ""Striker"" and his ""Mutants"". Then ""Logan"" fought ""Lady Deathsrtike"" killed her then tied ""Striker"" to the ""X-Jet"", help to save everyone. Also ""Magneto"" got his revenge and basically left ""Striker"" for dead. Then ""Gene"" and ""Cyclops"" fought and Gene won and helped saved her man Cyclops then after trying to escape. ""Gene"" stayed out there to help everyone escape and then the ""Phoenix"" was born. Then Charlies and the X-Men talked to The President to prevent a War from starting cuz they suffered losses from both sides and no need for further blood shed. 5. ""X-Men 3: Last Stand"" This is really when shit hit the fan when a Cure was born and the war really started after failing to stop it and the ""Brotherhood"" had a whole Army and were unsupportable. Then ""Gene as the Phoenix"" joined the ""Brotherhood"" after killing ""Charlies Xavier"" and now to destroy the humans and kill The President"". Until the ""X-Men"" helped to ""The President"" and stood against the ""Brotherhood"" to save the ""Humans"" and save the day then make things right but the cure still existed and then ""Logan Aka. Wolverine"" had to kill the one person he really loved ""Gene as the Phoenix"". Because she was laying waste to every human cuz he power was So Strong she made Humans and Mutants literally disappear. Then after the war ""Storm"" and everyone paid their respects to ""Charlies"" and kept ""The Mansion"" going as well as ""The School"" and ""Logan"" went out on his own again cuz he was depressed that he had to kill ""Gene"" to save everyone cuz he would have Died for her and not the Humans. Also ""Gene"" killed her original love ""Cyclops"". 6. ""The Wolverine"" ""Logan"" went out on his own and wanted to start a new life in isolation because he was at first. Losing his will to live cuz he had no one and nothing to fight for to keep living. Then he met a mysterious girl at a bar when some guys were about to get annihilated until by ""Logan"". and this was first time ever meeting ""The Wolverine"" who saved her Master back then after all the wars they been through if you seen ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". The many wars Logan and his Brother been and in one of those wars he save that mysterious woman's master. and now she wants to come back to Japan with her to reunite with her Master. Then all hell broke lose when he wanted to save Logan and make him Mortal, then Logan got involved with ""Yakuza"" and ""Ninjas"" and this hot dangerous lady with poisonous. and killer powers made ""Logan's"" flesh weak then he defeated everyone cuz when ""He's most vulnerable he's most Dangerous"". and now at the end it leads to ""Logan"" returning to the ""X-Men"" and their ""Mansion"". 7.

2013-12-06T12:42:07,"-if you're not interested in a rant, please ignore this comment. I'm sorry in advance.-  I'm sorry but decent x-men movie my ass. Listen- I'm a huge x-men fan- but the x-men aren't freaking about Wolverine. They don't revolve around Wolverine. 2 of my personal favorite x-men, Nightcrawler and Cyclops- aren't even in this movie-because apparently they can't recast those roles- yet they can get even more characters.  I'm not gonna say I hate Wolverine- but he's not on my list of favorite superheroes- so as an x-men fan it's disappointing that it REVOLVES around Wolverine. The Avengers was great- they did that perfect. The Fantastic Four was fine. no one had the spot light any longer than the other. But the freaking x-men movies are constant- "" WOLVERINE SAVE THE DAY"" ""WE CAN'T DO IT BUT WOLVERINE CAN"" The X-men NEVER depended on Wolverine before and they never will. He's part of the TEAM. it's not ""The Wolverines"" it's the ""X-men"" and besides- He wasn't even an original X-men member- so WHY does HE get the spotlight all the time? I understand maybe ONE character getting the spotlight PER-MOVIE. But it's not even that. it's constant Wolverine screen time. Like- if we could get movies where it follows the ORIGINAL team- that would be great- But I mean, of course they're still throw some kind of Wolverine cameo in there so what ever. God, if you're gonna revolve the movie around Wolverine- Just make Wolverine 3. But don't get everyone's hopes up and call it ""X-men"" cause it's not.  It doesn't matter how many X-men are in the movie- if wolverine has the spotlight the entire time, like he always does, it's not gonna matter. it's still gonna be a Wolverine movie. It just upsets me that all the other movies are amazing- and then we have freaking Wolverine and a few of the X-men. like, seriously- This is enough. Just keep making the Wolverine movies. but stop calling them ""X-men"" cause it's disappointing every time I see that it's only about how Wolverine saves the day.",2,0,Prolly Datboi,pK2zYHWDZKo,0.12242647058823529,2013-12-06 12:42:07,True,True

I prefer that they take their time to make something really incredible because I feel like Hugh Jackman really is something special. I don't see anyone as Wolverine except for him. He has the look, he gives 100% physically to ressemble to the the comic character and has the anger that Wolverine is suppose to have. Hugh Jackman is now 45 and will still be able to do maybe 2 films. So they should really try to make something really good cause i'm tired of seeing flops like The Wolverine which was an improvemnt to the x-men origins but nothing more.

While using a well outside to get some water, the young Magneto sees something fall from the night sky and crash to Earth nearby.

It's Apocalypse and he says, ""I have crossed rivers of time to find you."" Magneto asks, ""Who are you?""   The alien responds, ""I am your future."" Suddenly Apocalypse merges with Magneto, who screams and blasts an insane amount of energy and shockwaves around him. This energy explosion levels everything around him, with a blast radius that goes for miles. As Magneto looks at what he's done, he has a realization of the power he now holds and a villainous grin begins to form before the film cuts to black.""

2013-12-15T04:58:28,"I'm pretty sure some may Disagree with me but oh well LOL and i'm sure i'm annoying. With this Re-post but seriously last time until it's almost close to hitting theaters next year.   The Correct X-Men Movie Storyline Order  1. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" When Mutants First Appeared, Logan and his Brother were born and Emma Frost was Young as well as Cyclops. Then this was the story of how a War was about to Start  between Mutants and Humans over who will rule the earth. 2. ""X-Men: First Class"" The Birth of Charles and Erik Aka. Professor X & Magneto and this was the beginning of a War between Mutants and Humans. Also how Cerebro was founded and was given that name then The Mutants came to The Mansion to Harness their skills and live life their. Also to start a School there while finding other Mutants. Also how ""The Brotherhood of The Mutants"" were born after Magneto turned Evil 3. ""X-Men"" ""Charlies"" and ""Erik"" grew old after an old flash back of ""Erik's"" terrible past and then ""Rogue"" appeared and she kissed a boy and almost killed him. Then This was the beginning of a raging battle between the ""X-Men"" vs ""The Brotherhood"" while trying to prevent a War ""Charlies"" never wanted. The we had an Asshole named ""Senator Kelly"" who tried to expose all the humans for being very dangerous. Also ""Magneto"" tried to turn Humans into Mutants The ""X-Men"" beaten ""The Brotherhood"" and put ""Magneto"" in ""Prison"".  4. ""X-Men 2: United"" The War Started with the fake ""Senator Kelly"" impersonated by ""Mystique"" and Also ""Logan"" was falling more in Love with ""Gene"". When thing really got out of hand when ""Logan's"" old boss ""Striker"" showed up after attacking ""The Mansion"". Then tried ""Striker"" took over The Mansion and then tried to get ""Professor X"" killed by his strong mind bending son. Then that's when both the ""X-Men"" and ""Brotherhood"" teamed up and went to a Damn and took down ""Striker"" and his ""Mutants"". Then ""Logan"" fought ""Lady Deathsrtike"" killed her then tied ""Striker"" to the ""X-Jet"", help to save everyone. Also ""Magneto"" got his revenge and basically left ""Striker"" for dead. Then ""Gene"" and ""Cyclops"" fought and Gene won and helped saved her man Cyclops then after trying to escape. ""Gene"" stayed out there to help everyone escape and then the ""Phoenix"" was born. Then Charlies and the X-Men talked to The President to prevent a War from starting cuz they suffered losses from both sides and no need for further blood shed. 5. ""X-Men 3: Last Stand"" This is really when shit hit the fan when a Cure was born and the war really started after failing to stop it and the ""Brotherhood"" had a whole Army and were unsupportable. Then ""Gene as the Phoenix"" joined the ""Brotherhood"" after killing ""Charlies Xavier"" and now to destroy the humans and kill The President"". Until the ""X-Men"" helped to ""The President"" and stood against the ""Brotherhood"" to save the ""Humans"" and save the day then make things right but the cure still existed and then ""Logan Aka. Wolverine"" had to kill the one person he really loved ""Gene as the Phoenix"". Because she was laying waste to every human cuz he power was So Strong she made Humans and Mutants literally disappear. Then after the war ""Storm"" and everyone paid their respects to ""Charlies"" and kept ""The Mansion"" going as well as ""The School"" and ""Logan"" went out on his own again cuz he was depressed that he had to kill ""Gene"" to save everyone cuz he would have Died for her and not the Humans. Also ""Gene"" killed her original love ""Cyclops"". 6. ""The Wolverine"" ""Logan"" went out on his own and wanted to start a new life in isolation because he was at first. Losing his will to live cuz he had no one and nothing to fight for to keep living. Then he met a mysterious girl at a bar when some guys were about to get annihilated until by ""Logan"". and this was first time ever meeting ""The Wolverine"" who saved her Master back then after all the wars they been through if you seen ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". The many wars Logan and his Brother been and in one of those wars he save that mysterious woman's master. and now she wants to come back to Japan with her to reunite with her Master. Then all hell broke lose when he wanted to save Logan and make him Mortal, then Logan got involved with ""Yakuza"" and ""Ninjas"" and this hot dangerous lady with poisonous. and killer powers made ""Logan's"" flesh weak then he defeated everyone cuz when ""He's most vulnerable he's most Dangerous"". and now at the end it leads to ""Logan"" returning to the ""X-Men"" and their ""Mansion"". 7.

I think ""Magneto"" is looked up. lol I hope the movie is good cuz i'm loving this old cartoon and in ""The Danger Room"" on ""X-Men 3: The Last Stand"" they were fighting ""The Sentinels"" and in a Huge War Zone.

Does anyone know what I'm trying to say? Since there can be mutants with the same abilities I believe, I was thinking that Magneto just found two different ""Mystique's,"" and just named the one in 2006 movie after the one in the 2011 movie.   Like in X-Men: First class (2011) it was all about how Magneto and Xavier met, and how Mystique and Magneto met as well in the past. Although in X-Men: The last stand (2006) it was about the present tension Magneto and Xavier had and stuff, so if Mystique was cured in the future why is she back in this movie which represents present time? Present time meaning the time where Logan(Wolverine) is involved and Kitty and those people in the first, second, and third X-Men movies...I know there was a possibility that she gained her powers back like Magneto did, but wouldn't they basically hate each other? Maybe it's the character change that's ******* with my mind. I hope I'm making sense...........

And it's annoying, it's not something that pops up only once saying ""This is the new way to identify yourself on YouTube *Completely Optional*"". Noope. It's the kind that pops up _every single time_ you try to use YouTube so you eventually are forced to choose a ""new identity"" when we YouTube users don't have identity crises (idk what the plural for crisis is) at all and in reality just want to watch whatever the fuck we felt like watching. Goddammit. Anyway these identity things make me feel like I have to prove myself to society more or something with that lame new ID picture we have next to our usernames when we comment on videos. This isn't fucking Tumblr or Facebook, man. Nobody wants to have to actually _try_ to identify themselves as a ""cool, popular, well-rounded person that society is pressuring me to be"" by finding a cool picture of their interests or posting a cute selfie of themselves like those Tumblr girls do to look like they actually have social lives and aren't internet freaks. Youtube is where we just want to be slobs and get distracted from watching science videos for school and watching dumb (but adorable) cat videos for three hours instead. Youtube is where we look something up on our iPhones when we're having debates with our friends about what the lyrics of a song are or which crappy 90's band's lead singer vomited at the 1996 Superbowl halftime concert. (Youtube is like the = to Wikipedia for proving things in social situations sometimes.) I...I just...don't want to connect to people in the YouTube comments personally ight? It's supposed to be a lazy, anonymous, and convienient way to share personal comments. Why do we suddenly need to be exchanging more information about ourselves randomly by ""connecting to facebook"" or ""sharing on Google+""?!?! Just let Youtube be what made it magical when it first started: it was a way for people to create and consume original content and exchange feedback, responses, comments, and ideas as simply thoughts and personalities instead of revealing the person, the personal identity behind the online anonymity of people's pure personalities.

It's gonna be more focused on Eric and Charles this time around with the other mutants banning together to stop the sentinel program. It's gonna lead us into an age of apocalypse story line in 2016. I gotta say I really think the X men  franchise deserves more recognition then it gets. Especially after the mega hit avengers it seems like the X men kind of lost steam.

So is he going to be the answer to the magic bullet theory? It was because of magneto that the bullet went all crazy causing all those weird wounds therefore setting in motion the events of the future instead of senator Kelly being killed as the cause? They have to come up with another reason besides Kelly because in the first bad Xmen movie he was turned into a mutant fish man then he died (by turning into water). So he can't be part of the story unless they go back in time in this movie and prevent what happens in the first Xmen movie. But that would change everything else up. Man I hope I'm wrong.

His mutant power lets him absorb most forms of energy to increase his strength, speed, and resistance to injury. He's a deep character with a lot of history in the X-men series. However, based on IMDB, his part in this movie (portrayed by Omar Sy) appears minimal at best, which is a shame: the plotline seems ideal for Bishop to have a heavier role.",0,0,chefbreccia,pK2zYHWDZKo,0.29259259259259257,2014-03-24 19:08:04,True,True

Saying Oh ""Wolverine is the most beloved character"" is basically in my opinion another way of suger-coding saying that it should be a male role model with More experience. Why make a movie about the xmen original story if basically the whole entire movie is going to be changed? as a kitty pryde fan I was completely furious when I heard about this sudden change, and then it caused me to hate the wolverine character more then I had already did so. I agree with other peoples opinions saying that they over use wolverine as the main character in every movie. in My honest opinion I don't know why people like wolverine that much anyway! hes basically a male version of a badass cat. When I say they focus on him to much is like for example...- the story between phoenix ""jean grey' and scott summers was one of the most important more cared about scenario in the xmen franchise and yet there hasn't been a movie about them, instead they put out a movie such as wolverine origens which really wasn't all that important and cared for. Back on the main topic, they could've made some adjustments that could still allow ellen page or kitty pryde to still be the leading character such as drag the time line earlier or something so she could actually be alive (if they could make a drastic move like replacing her completely the they could've done something like this) but instead on actually giving her a chance in the movie they completely replaced her. And anyone saying that main characters have to be well known are lying. If you look at first class Mystique, Banshee, pixie, havoc etc. weren't really known characters but they got to play a major role in the film portrayed as main characters.

2014-05-26T08:53:20,"Spoilers ahead...  A lot of people are excited about how DoFP essentially retcons X3 out of existence, but is anyone interested in speculating on exactly HOW the new timeline Wolverine helped create differences from the previous movies?  Just a few speculations...  Xavier snapped out of his depression much earlier in this new timeline than he probably did in the old one (if what he said in the original X-Men movie about Scott, Jean, and Storm being his ""first"" students was true, he probably didn't reopen the school in the original timeline until the 1990s). Thus, he'll be able to re-start the X-Men earlier and grow into a more effective leader.  Xavier read Wolverine's mind and saw key events of the old timeline (including the Dark Phoenix saga) and spent the next fifty years altering events to prevent certain tragedies. Specifically, he helped a young Jean Grey ACCEPT her full powers as Phoenix (rather than suppressing them as he did in the original timeline) which kept her from ever developing her Dark Phoenix persona and killing all those people (instead she likely helped save more people with her full power). This also basically saves his life since she won't kill him.  Despite his need to alter events, this new Xavier may be slightly less manipulative than the previous Xavier since he learns how dangerous it can be to try and control a person (like Mystique) and how important it is to let them make their own decisions.  Xavier also found and took in a young Leech before government scientists could capture him and use his genes to create the mutant ""cure"" that robbed mutants of their powers in X3. Thus, Mystique, Rogue, and Magneto never lost their powers -- at least not via the ""cure""  Mystique broke ties with Magneto at the end of DoFP, making it unlikely they'll have the master-servant relationship of the original trilogy (I'm speculating that in the original timeline where she was captured after killing Trask she was lobotomized by scientists who used her brain tissue to study her mutant powers. Magneto then ""rescued"" her and took advantage of her brain damage to turn her into the silent killer from the original X-Men trilogy, which is why she doesn't have any problem putting Xavier into a coma in the original film -- she might not even remember him).  In this new timeline, she probably became a more independent character who doesn't subscribe to either Xavier or Magneto's ideologies -- although she might be more open to becoming a freelance covert operative of Xavier's since she does reconcile with him a bit at the end. (Maybe the plot of a solo Mystique movie?)  Wolverine, sadly, will probably have to go through most of the tragedies he lived through in the old timeline (including the adamantium bonding) -- but he'll have Xavier secretly keeping an eye on him for the day when he once again rejoins the X-Men.  Magneto will probably be responsible for even more atrocities than he performed in the original timeline (largely because Xavier and Wolverine helped break him out of prison possibly years before he was supposed to have escaped). Thus, mutant tensions might actually RISE for a while -- necessitating the earlier formation of the X-Men.         ",7,1,Spidercat616,pK2zYHWDZKo,0.1382660308441558,2014-05-26 08:53:20,False,True

THANK YOU A LOT IF YOU CAN ANSWER.* Don't tell me to watch the old films because I've just watched them ALL in one week, so I quite remember every detail of the seven films. (I've also watched the old films several times a few years ago, but I did re-watch them recently)  1) Why is Charles Xavier alive? (You mean to tell me he's alive because he transferred his mind into a person's body, which is explained in X3, the question is, his body is buried, so even if his mind still exists, the body should be another individual's body). The credits of The Wolverine shows that Xavier is alive and Wolverine is shocked to see him, but Charles just said ""You're not the only one here. There are somethings that you don't understand) WHICH STILL DOES NOT EXPLAIN WHY HE IS ALIVE.  2) How does Magneto get his power back? If you mean to tell me in X3, he got his power back from the chess play, okay don't reply me. If you have new answers, I would be very glad to hear them.  3) Why does Wolverine has adamantium claws and his healing powers again? In The Wolverine which takes place after X3, before Days of Future Past, his adamantium *AND HEALING POWERS* were extracted by The Silver Samurai. Therefore, by right he should have only bone claws now.  4) If Mystique kills Trask incident happens after First Class, before X1, does that mean her ability is restored? Because in X3 she lost her ability due to a ""mutant cure"" being shot and injected to her. Also why is she doing things alone without Magneto knowing while killing Trask? According to First Class, she's not doing things alone but she's on the Magneto team.",6,0,MapleStory012,pK2zYHWDZKo,0.030699211502782937,2014-06-07 15:51:39,False,True

Yet in the 2nd solo Wolverine movie Professor X and Magneto had to warn Wolverine of a danger, in which they all should have known already since big gigantic robots attacking them was a scenario that they trained to handle... (you would think professor x and magneto would tell wolverine in the solo wolverine movie ""hey we need to find that leech kid or the formula for the cure... because there's this threat.. and the sentinels are more advance.. and hey maybe we can use it to our advantage.."" Because also... how could professor x not know about the sentinels unless he did come from the future or read the future through a vision.. right?)  Leech (X-men 3) could have been used to destroy the organic future Sentinels with mutant powers.. I would think Magneto, Professor X and the countless mutants involved would have realized he can be used to mask their powers or against the sentinels. The ""cure"" could have been used against the organic sentinels to de-power in order to be destroyed.  (Wouldn't you think future sentinels would have been armed with the Cure ???)  Apocalypse was not affected in the time travel changes. Since he is the first mutant, invincible and most powerful he was not even seen at all in the future. The sentinels past or future should be able to track him in his slumber, because if the sentinels couldn't track him would that mean sleep helps mutants be hidden?    Rogue will be in the future re-release... But she never touched Ms. Marvel (fox has no rights to her) so most likely she shouldn't be alive since her character has been weak in previous movies. Her gaining other powers is always temporary in the film. If she were alive you would think Rogue could be used to merge Professor X and Kitty Prydes power together to bring back Wolverine in the past since. Which makes no sense by the way since it's similar to thinking about what if I changed the past in mind yet nothing changes in reality.    Nimrod should have been used in the movie and other extreme sentinels.. I would think there would be adamantium made Sentinels.. Hell wouldn't they be able to make themselves adamantium too since they gained and enhanced mystques powers.  Sentinels in the future should be near invincible after gaining an unlimited amount of powers, still though they shouldn't be able to destroy Apocalypse.   Somehow Magneto in the past controlled the 1st generation sentinels by CPU also?! He was able to control their framework but also CPU?!   I'm over Mags being the bad guy then good guy over and over.. Wolverine always having to save the day, which is a spoiler of course.

Also you see Rogue so was she never cured? Did the cure not exist yet like in X-men:Last Stand? Another thing did Logan never go to Japan like he does in Wolverine: Origins which is suppose to be about his left after leaving the X-men. I even got confused that in the beginning of Day's of Future Past that he had metal claws cause didn't his metal claws get taken away in Wolverine: Origins?

Mystique was also very much alive in the original trilogy, So if she was captured and dissected to create the sentinels, then she should not have been in the original Trilogy, and the Sentinels should have been. If this is supposed to be a continuation of the original trilogy, then please writers, stick with the story line and history of it.   Oh, and DNA sequencing was very very difficult in the early 70s.   But ignoring all this, I guess it was an OK movie, but it lacked the exploration of the dark side of being an X-men like the original trilogy and those that hated them.

We got two of the MCU's best with _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ and _Guardians of the Galaxy_ , then of course, this film. A film that undid all the damage caused by _X-Men: The Last Stand_ , and provided a different take on one of the best messages any film can deliver.

One of the main reasons that TV show Heroes from the early 2000's lost its audience and got cancelled was because of time travelling. It is impossible to keep continuity for too long with time travelling stories, it all becomes confusing and detached.
