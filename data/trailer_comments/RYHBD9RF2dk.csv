Read at your own risk :)    It's really funny to me that so many people are complaining about this movie because it's basically a musical Zootopia in their eyes, when in all honesty it's not. The only thing Zootopia and this movie has in common is the talking animals. I am also amazed that so many people are judging this because the characters are actually animals and not humans. Really people? This is a main concern to some of you?   This is basically how I see things. If a character is relatable, it should not matter if they are animals or humans. It's the characters personality that makes us love them. Sure some, if not all,  of these characters seem a little cliche to me, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad. Basically I just wish you all would judge this movie on things that could actually make it good or bad. Like who the actual characters are and how they are portrayed. Or probably most important, the story, (which hopefully won't be as messy as I am fearing)   I'm not saying this movie will be good or bad, but I definitely won't judge it because it has animal characters instead of humans, and hopefully some of you won't either.",0,0,Sarah Dilts,RYHBD9RF2dk,0.08996913580246914,2016-05-30 06:56:31,True,True

He means to print the winning reward as $1000 but the dumb assistant prints it as $100,000. He doesn't tell the contestants that he doesn't have the money and just hopes it will all turn out alright. The big elephant chokes in the auditions and doesn't make it because she is very shy. To try and get the money, the koala goes after a very wealthy goat to try and lend him the money temporarily. She agrees to come for a trial of the show before she agrees to the deal. Meanwhile the little rat stole some money from some big gorillas at a casino and they are after him. When the wealthy goat arrives for the private viewing of the show, it is spectacular as the stage is see through glass with colourful squids swimming underneath. All is going well until the gorillas chasing the little rat storm in and charge onto the glass stage. The glass cracks, and all the water flows out, and then the whole theatre collapses. At this point the chest that supposedly has 100K inside opens, revealing 1K. All the contestants are shocked but not completely pissed off. Now the koala is lost and there is a bout a 10min patch of the movie where everything is depressing. Then the koala hears the elephant singing while he is at a car wash getting all the money he can, and hearing this elephant that choked at the auditions lights a fire in him that the show can still go on. The koala and the contestants now agree it isn't about the money but the reputation for them all. They all construct a dodgy open air cinema made out of the rubble of the theatre and the crowd starts off small, but soon enough the whole city arrives and it is a hit, with the elephant closing the show. The little gorilla contestant (Johnny), sings as well and his dad who is in prison suddenly realises the talent his son has, so he breaks out of prison just to go and say to his son that he is proud of him. A happy ending, as the theatre is re-opened after being sponsored by the old goat as she was impressed with the open air cinema. Johnny's dad returns to prison. Only down side of the movie is that there is no actual competition.",0,0,MM Sport Highlights,RYHBD9RF2dk,0.09538122106481482,2016-12-20 23:41:52,False,True

2016-12-22T01:57:16,"based on the trailer, it looks like another forgettable, by-the-numbers animated movie that fails at its comedy (imo) almost as much as it does at  telling a unique and interesting story. The plot seems about as generic as another COD installment, and none of the characters stand out to me as particularly memorable. Oh, but they all have a sob-story background! Great, now i get to watch 6 or however many contestants overcome their super-hard life struggles by singing... that'll make for a real interesting story /s  The music choices seem boring as well. the roster appears to be composed of nothing but #1 music billboard hits. that's the same reason i got tired of american idol - just constant mainstream BS that lacks any sort of emotion or feeling (and i include ""stay with me"" in that group).  I'm not bashing anyone who wants to watch this movie; i'm just saying that for an animated flick, NOTHING in it stands out as even remotely interesting or memorable to me. just an opinion though.",0,0,Notyour bizness,RYHBD9RF2dk,0.14166666666666666,2016-12-22 01:57:16,False,True

2019-03-02T01:42:03,"Honestly, if you take out the ‚Äúanthropomorphic animal‚Äù aspect out of Sing, this movie has no reason to be animated. At all. To me, there‚Äôs no story or visual reasons as to why it wanted to be animated. And what‚Äôs frustrating is that the animators could‚Äôve so easily fixed this problem had they made the animals have animalistic traits, have cartoony sequences with the chase scenes (like in Zootopia or Finding Dory) or have visual illusions and sequences matched to every character arc, like matching greyer and darker colours to reflect when a character is feeling sad, like in Cats Don‚Äôt Dance.  I feel like if Sing put the same amount of effort that Zootopia did with its use of animation, world building and anthropomorphic animals, it would‚Äôve given it much more variety and visual appeal than just boring slice-of-life places.   Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I happily encourage more animation in children‚Äôs entertainment, but animation has *requirements.*",0,0,Unicorn Bunny,RYHBD9RF2dk,0.007692307692307682,2019-03-02 01:42:03,False,False
