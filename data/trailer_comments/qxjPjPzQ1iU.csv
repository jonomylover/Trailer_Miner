I was disappointed when i came to the realization that rather than a war between 2 different races, we got a war between 2 human groups, and the apes more less just trapped in the middle of it... quite literally. If I had to rate this movie. It would be a 6/10 just because of that simple fact.

2017-10-29T01:18:47,"*When they reach the point of the original film, they should cast Michael Fassbender as a young Charlton Heston.*  Also, don't correct me about this being a different timeline. The creators' intention was always to lead up to the 1968 film.  If you've done your homework and want to challenge me with these points: -The Icarus spacecraft is seen leaving earth in Rise, which contradicts the ship leaving in 1972 A.D. in the original film: That was just an easter egg at a time when they weren't sure if they'd have so many sequels. If it were truly a vital plot point that it left recently instead of in 1972, they would have made the scene more clearly. -Nova appears in War when she's supposed to meet Taylor in 3978 A.D.: That's clearly not the same Nova because her hair and skin is the wrong tone, she is fully aware of intelligent humans and she receives her name by happy coincidence. -Caesar died before ever fighting Aldo: Aldo is cited in Ape scripture in the original film, but the scripture never said that he'd met Caesar. That's only a product of the largely improvised sequels, which are not canon anymore. As Caesar was the Ape equivalent of Moses, likely Aldo will be the Ape Messiah of their New Testament. Maybe he'll even be responsible for the Statue of Liberty sticking out of the shore like that.  You skeptics are the same people who said that these new films were a full reboot of the original that took things more seriously, which is why we'll probably never see the modern Ape city and the mute humans. And yet the Apes only get more advanced with each film, and they found a realistic way to make humans mute again. Why would they do that if it weren't a prequel to the original?

In ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, years pass and we see this boy has grown into a young king. He has a wife, and two children, he has something to fight for, something important. His conflicting feelings about apes and humans get in the way of his life. He remembers his human father, who taught him, and loved him. He showed compassion and mercy, but the world did not share the same feelings as him. In ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" we see the boy become into a great king with resolve. He has decided to fight, despite his feelings, he fights. The following quote ""No mercy, no peace, this is war"" is proof of his resolve, later he states ""I did not start this war, but I will finish it.""
