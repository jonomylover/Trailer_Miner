You people think movies are filmed the week before they are released or what? come on guys it takes at least a couple months to film and then there is whats called post production where they edit the movie which can take any given amount of time depending on scheduling, then they schedule release dates that best fit a film. for example...superhero movies get released in the summer season when people have time to go see movies, which is why its considered the blockbuster season, where movies not expected to make a lot of money are released generally in Jan, Feb, hence why there isn't top dollar movies out right now. That's just a general idea of how it works not the exactly (before you jump down my throat with specifics ha).
