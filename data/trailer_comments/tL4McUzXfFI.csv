I wonder how a movie like this got made in Hollywood, and I applaud the filmmakers for their bravery in challenging conventions and delivering an urgent message that has not yet been heard.  Oh, sorry, I was thinking of _The Great Dictator._ Since Nazism ceased to be politically relevant about 75 years ago, this movie either doesn't have a political message or it's a stupid and immoral message conflating modern-day non-violent conservatives and nationalists with National Socialist fanatic mass murderers. _The Great Dictator_ was a tremendous moral stand, _The Producers_ was a brave successful approach of a taboo subject, this is just satirizing the easiest possible target, one that is historical and no longer extant in any meaningful, influential sense.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy making fun of Nazis and pointing out their tremendous evil, but with the current political climate I'm expecting this movie will at least be promoted as relevant to contemporary politics, which is to say it will portray center-right politicians like Donald Trump and Boris Johnson as somehow modern-day Nazis. Obviously not relevant since they're not starting wars, mass murdering millions of people, launching genocidal campaigns, are not totalitarians or authoritarians, are opposed to socialism, and are in charge of liberal democracies with fair and free elections and rule of law.  That said, with politics aside, I like Taika Waititi and the cinematography is very pretty to look at (nice and colorful with no obvious horrible color grading), so I'll probably enjoy this film as I did _Hunt for the Wilderpeople._ I don't mind Waikiki casting himself in whiteface as Adolf Hitler.

2019-09-04T23:38:38,"I find this extremely offensive!!!!!!!  Taika Waititi is part of our elitist neo-liberal controlled movie industry/media in New Zealand.   Our government is corrupt and drives children and abuse victims to suicide ON PURPOSE - we are No 1 in the western world for driving children to suicide, women self-harming, eating disorders, domestic/flatmate violence and of course homelessness.    Waititi participates in govt neo-liberal based suicide prevention propaganda, where they actually incite more suicide than they ever prevent AND LOTS OF SELF-RIGHTEOUS IGNORANT PEOPLE MAKE MONEY OUT OF IT.   And lots more are in charities and mentally ill people thinking they are going to fix people who want to commit suicide.  Most mentally ill people who think they are going to fix all suicides are actually dysfunctional people who have no friends - for good reason - they latch on to suicidal people (who are normal and suffering because of poverty, homelessness and unemployment caused by 30 yrs of neo-liberal economic reforms that were in fact ILLEGAL UNDER NZ AND INTERNATIONAL LAW).  Check out my youtube channel about the reality of living in this neo-liberal hell hole country.  You will also find a post I did outside Peter Jackson's house and I've just worked out where that American cultural vampire James Cameron lives and intend to do a protest outside his house as well and outside the business of his spoilt brat rich kids.  A news story about how people don't like Cameron because he is growing organic veges rather than meat was the biggest load of BS PROPAGANDA I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.   They found some stupid hick to be in the story BUT VAST MAJORITY OF NEW ZEALAND LOCALS DESPISE CAMERON FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  Firstly he came to NZ and drove local people off the land so he could buy it - only foreigners can afford land here now after our govt impoverished 80% of the local population.    2nd he is a cultural vampire - which means artists/playwrights/writers like myself will never be able to make any money from our creativity.   We won't be able to convince anybody our ideas are what people actually want to (and need to) watch, so we won't get funding also we will never have the audience.   People spend their money going to see THE BIG MOVIES about BS.  Its a cultural genocide run by greedy globalists - trying to destroy individual cultures in countries like New Zealand.  Taika Waititi is an embarrassment to most New Zealanders, its only marketing and publicity to na√Øve people that gets him any recognition.   He's part of the suicide promotion industry, once he hears what I know about what's happening I'm sure he'll expose it - many of the people who are committing suicide are 'sensitive' artists who can't get work.   Many rich powerful people just dont' understand or want to understand what is happening.  IF they knew what I knew they would help me stop what is going on.   I want my own culture back, I want to hear and see the art of local people, born here (whatever colour they are) I AM SICK TO DEATH OF THE AMERICAN AND GLOBAL BS EVERYBODY IS GETTING SHOVED DOWN THEIR THROAT.   IT IS SOOOOOO BORING and does not reflect what is happening in our country.",0,7,JR Murphy,tL4McUzXfFI,0.04626384453998931,2019-09-04 23:38:38,True,True

The director because they directed Thor ragnarok and a really good movie that wasn‚Äôt easy to see outside AUS and NZ called hun for the wilderpeople. The 2nd movie is great because of its believable characters, great humour, simply amazing editing and a highlight is the music. This trailer alone makes me excited as the music and characters seem really good as well as the story. This seems a bit more directed towards being grounded in reality rather than comedy for some bits, which is respectable yet I would enjoy it as well as a comedy centred movie.

2019-09-06T20:40:33,"I'm attracted to this marvelously quirky movie.  In an odd, far-reaching way (and from a deep, psychological perspective), it harkens Dr Jordan Peterson's warnings/admonitions about man's capacity for malevolence (and from that, how to fortify yourself to possibly resist it).  Specifically, Peterson talks about how any one of us - including himself - would have most likely ""fallen-in with the crowd"" of being a Nazi or BrownShirt in Germany circa 1930s.  It's easy to try and see ourselves as a social and spiritual hero of the day - say, an Anne Frank, or Dietrich Bonhoeffer, or Oskar Schindler - but only the rarest of us would have such stout, brave constitution.  Most of us would have succumbed to the omnipotent psychological phenomenon and brainwashing.  Taika Waititi tackles this deep, personal struggle in his own quirky, humorous style through the eyes of the young protagonist, Jojo.  It's fascinating, really.  (And just for the record, I, too, fear that I would have fallen in with the crowd back then.  Groupthink can be a very powerful setting; it's a mental state that can only be truly and honestly assessed after-the-fact.)",0,2,cottonclarksa,tL4McUzXfFI,0.18178571428571427,2019-09-06 20:40:33,True,True

A boy is literally willing to become a Nazi (a member of a murderous, hateful group) because he wants to be accepted, wants to be respected, and wants the positive reinforcement of his peers...even if his peers are Nazis  Just think about what societal standards and values that you adopt because it makes you look better in the eyes of others...  For example: Men want to be tough and cool and smart and want to be recognized as such so we adapt ourself to the image of what society tells us this kind of person is and how they would act  (I.e eat meat, belittle others, abuse women, support gun violence)  Most (if not all) ideas and beliefs we hold on to...are actually not our own....they are just our fathers or our coach‚Äôs....societies beliefs that we adapted because it made us look better to our peers, but all I see is a sheep conforming to fit in with the other sheep who can‚Äôt think for themselves and make their own decisions, who are cowards who decide who they are based on the criteria of others. You are the Nazi who didn‚Äôt have the balls to stand up to the Nazis so you became one (it‚Äôs worse actually because you so quickly adopted the beliefs of others that you don‚Äôt even get a chance to be anyone before you became a Nazi)  Think long and hard about who you really are and who you want to be and why, not just based on what society has told you is cool that you blindly gobbled up like a serving of shit",0,0,Yeah,tL4McUzXfFI,0.14524740492482427,2019-09-06 21:16:26,True,True

2019-09-07T04:21:11,"Of course you'd need some populist shill like Johansson playing the objective and disillusioned ""lawful good"" character. Almost as if she wouldn't sacrifice her principles for comedic purposes, why her acting is so stiff and dreadful, and why she's an emotionless personality vacuum. Can't wait to yawn whenever she's on screen.  Don't want to be the guy to bring historical accuracy into a satirical comedy, but nazification was so severe, that a kid wouldn't dare question if it was a good time to be a Nazi or not; because it always was. Or at least, that's what the ministry of propaganda was feeding them. If you want people to understand the actual seriousness of the tone you're setting underneath all that comedy and for the political climate Germans lived in at the time; because I'd assume sending that message was your intention given the circumstances; you need to believe that your main character is also subjected to that propaganda. The mothers character would be willingly sending her son off to Hitler youth, putting up pictures of Nazi propaganda all over the house, and painting Hitler as the ideal husband in her own head. Infact, it's a wonder she would be single at all in Nazi Germany without a man keeping her secure. As sexist as it sounds, and I assume feminism and strong independent women is their intention, she should be on the street or desperately trying to find a husband. Not making her own way in the upper echelons of Nazi society. Giving a woman so much power without earning it actually downplays the sacrifices they made to get there, and only hides the real challenges women faced not just in Germany, but other places around the world too. With something for the character to face and accept or challenge, it becomes their redemption story; rather than a one dimensional ""I'm a good guy now"" plot. Or maybe I'm looking too much into it and it really is just a movie for kids, which sends very mixed messages.   Hold on a minute... I wonder how many parents will take their kids to see a comedy movie plastered in Nazi iconography?

2019-09-10T12:37:01,"Scarlett Johansson Windsor is a nazi and not the ethnicities she says. Those families and their kind lie.  When she takes off her suit it is not a normal human. It is similar to who is in the Inglourious Basterds film. All of them are nazi descendants and active members. This is common in Hollywood and they call themselves Jewish, but they were not even Germanic Jews or from anywhere else.    Black Widow was cancelled before in 2008-2011 because Scarlett Johansson Windsor was making crush videos and you can clearly see her face in a few. She and Angelina Jolie Windsor also made '2 girls one cup' videos (do not watch those) with each other, Tom Cruise Windsor Rothschild and children. It is disgusting. The investors kind of gave her discipline but now they are rewarding her since nazis own Disney and all of the other companies. Law enforcement, lawyers and the judicial system know about this stuff and nothing has been done. A few people were blocked.    When Scarlett Johansson Windsor or Demi Lovato have child pornography on their devices and are taking pictures of children it does not matter what those children are or why the kids are there. Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr. have been smiling and laughing with blood around their mouths and boys penises missing. They apparently have to use a catheter for the rest of their lives. People, law enforcement, lawyers, the investors, the scientologists, etc know about and nothing has been done. A few wanted to do something but were blocked. Drake Aubrey Windsor Rothschild has also been involved and got copies of many pictures and videos. It makes no sense that anybody wants these pieces of garbage around. This was at Comet Ping Pong and Besta Pizza with the tunnels underneath the businesses and the torture chambers. People were seen eating in those pictures on the other side of the glass during the day and during parties.    Scarlett Johansson Windsor is #pizzagate, #hotdoggate, #pedogate, #rapegate, #crushvideogate, #bestialitygate, #nazigate and #aidsgate. She pretends she represents the gay community but has given people aids and their families made it or modified it with the injections.",0,0,SyncroScales,tL4McUzXfFI,0.029861111111111116,2019-09-10 12:37:01,True,True

It already looks very professional but taking a circumstance of love and how it conquers all in a satirical approach to hate. I think a central point would be when the young woman responds to his "" a-jew"" with a ""gesundheit""(used to wish good health to a person who has just sneezed.)[perhaps in a slight way like a ""shalom"" if he would know loosely].  Not a pleading response but ""learning his language""  to show a human approach.  To be quite honest i believe this will be a self-encapsulated story with a moral as most stories ought to be to be taken for what it is.

This movie took that era very seriously to the point that it turned a huge scale war into a very personal level...

But all that stuff was 70 years ago, and people from those times are mostly very very old or dead, yet there are people who get offended nowadays when black humor comes out as well as satire things related to Nazism and Hitler, it's as if those people lived through those times and were affected by it, yet they never did.  Personally I am very neutral and I like black/dark humor, and this movie, like it says, is incorporating satire thorough and might be hard for them to see this movie any different than offensive rather than humorous in some scenes.  Personally I don't understand those people, how anyone can get offended by it at all nowadays, it's like nobody is offended by Caesar or Napoleon, they were basically equal but oldschool, and people are almost glorifying those historically infamous people for what they could achieve back then. But nobody bats an eye on them, I could guess why, but not any of those possibilities are enough of a reason to why bother with something that was 70 years ago, and not with something that was hundreds and thousands of years ago.  Same thing with PewDiePie controversy when dumb media took things subjectively and not objectively, and does not understand satire things, neither jokes, and just does it for attention and clicks.  I do wonder how many people, who usually get offended by Nazi and Hitler memes, or satire things related to Nazism and Hitler, though about this movie or watched it and actually either enjoyed or hated.",0,0,BIOSHOCKFOXX,tL4McUzXfFI,-0.020493827160493822,2020-02-14 19:25:33,False,False

In the trailer, you see a 10 year old kid with his imaginary friend, Hitler. You think, ""Wow, this is going to be funny."" It's then when you go to see the movie, your expectations of the movie are cast aside for what the movie really shows. You see, the trailer was purposely done like this. It took most of the comedic parts of JoJo Rabbit, but it leaves out all the dark parts of the movie. The trailer tricks you, henceforth you could consider it Nazi propaganda considering the movie and how it tricks you of what you are thinking. It shows the happy times but excludes anything dark, just like the Nazi posters.  When you watch the film, in the beginning, it is all happy, funny. But then, it pulls a 180 and shows you that JoJo's mother was hanged because she promoted a free Germany without the Nazis. Near the end, Germany was invaded so then JoJo can really see what war is like. He becomes disillusioned with the Nazis and his previous beliefs. He returns home to Elsa, where after lying who won the war, he talks to Hitler. They have a brief argument where JoJo has enough and breaks their friendship. When JoJo and Elsa walk outside they can now dance. JoJo can now walk outside as a young boy, not a Nazi.",6,0,C_4Star,tL4McUzXfFI,0.1777777777777778,2020-04-22 16:13:20,False,False

Also he‚Äôs gay so he felt sympathy for the kid. Really great movie I love it! Sad that we never got to see the father though.,1,0,I BROKEMYOWNHEART,tL4McUzXfFI,0.30520833333333336,2020-06-06 00:45:34,False,False
