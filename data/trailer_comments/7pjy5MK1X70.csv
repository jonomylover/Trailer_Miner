I apologize for sounding like a know-it-all (I'm not) but I'm studying the Brothers Grimm tales in AP English Literature and Composition now, & I for one am excited to finally see a rendition of these classic fairy tales based on the original Brothers Grimm tales. I think that the darker imagery stays more true to the loss of innocence/Bildugsroman form and the darker elements that have been altered in the earlier (kid friendly) Disney renditions. The villainous characters are more polarized against the good and better fit the traditional archetypes. I would like to see a TRUE retelling of the work of the German folklorists.",0,0,Christina Gu,7pjy5MK1X70,0.2759803921568627,2014-11-09 03:53:22,True,True

The trailer I had seen made it seem like it was gonna be a straight up adventure movie with the fairytale characters and shit, so for Christmas my older sister, her boyfriend and I all go to the theater and we  were debating, ya know 'what should we watch' . We got tickets originally for Unbroken,  but then my sister was like I wanna see into the woods,  and at first I totally forgot what that was so I was thinking ""The fvck is into the woods""  but then I saw the poster and remembered and was like ""OH I wanna see that too!"" so my sisters boyfriend decided to exchange the tickets for Into The Woods.   Skipping my whole waiting experience and sitting in the theater watching trailers and taking glances at my phone then finally silencing it. The movie finally begins.  All of us knew we were fvcked the moment we heard Anna Kendrick sing ""I wish"".  The first thing my sisters boyfriend did was say ""Mya are they gonna be singing through the whole movie?""  Truthfully I didn't know or not so of course I said no but deep down in my heart I knew... this sh*t was gonna be a musical.  Okay so now 5minutes into the movie,  they're still singing ""I wish"" 10minutes into the movie a little bit of regular talking,  now don't be fooled you're probably thinking 'Oh finally' and then BAM someone has to make a rhyme which turns into a lyric which turns into a song that last for about 5mins maybe longer.  Then finally for a good 5-15minutes they stop singing and they're kinda funny.  I mean it's funny if you're with the right people who can make the movie funny, I mean the movie cracked a few jokes here and there but overall it was pretty much my sister and I, like the Red riding hood scene with the wolf,  and the rapunzel stuff.   Let's skip into about 30 minutes of the movie, the singing continues, 45 minutes they're still singing, 50minutes probably at a decent dialogue for let's say a good 20 minutes, then of course someone makes a rhyme which makes a lyrics which turns into a song.  1hr and probably 10mins into the movie were finally believe it was over.. BUT NO NO NO OF COURSE NOT IT'S NOT OVER YET!!  cause seems to be Disney likes to add levels and crap extending the movie, so for another decent 20mins the singing stops.  Yay!  Oh wait... What's that?  Was that a rhyme?  Oh Yes it was... Here comes another 5mins musical! And pretty much keeps going like this pattern until they end,  but they don't sing at the end thank God for that.    What I'm tryna say Is by the end of the movie (which is about 2hrs long?) you'll most likely be singing ""Into the woooods"" over and over again. I'm not trying to say it's a terrible movie that should never be watch, no I give it 4 stars and deep deep deep DEEP down I personally enjoyed it, and unless you like plays and I'm talking about Broadway Musical type of plays in a movie format then maybe this is the movie for you.

2014-12-29T22:50:49," If any of you are thinking about seeing this, here's my review. (I saw the original musical as well) So if you have never heard of Into The Woods before, than it's a story about four well known fairytale characters: Cinderella, Rapunzel, Little Red Ridinghood, and Jack from Jack and The Beanstalk along with a witch (Gothel from Rapunzel) and two new characters the Baker and his wife. The Baker and his wife must go on a journey to collect four ingredients to make a potion for the witch so that they can have a kid; the cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, and the slipper as pure as gold. It's a story about being careful what you wish for and that things aren't always as they seem. It's rated PG, but I wouldn't recommend bringing small children as it's pretty long, and they might get bored. The actors all did a fantastic job, I was especially impressed with the baker's wife, Jack, the baker, and the wolf. Of course Meryl Streep was beyond fantastic, she made an absolutely perfect witch. The singing was incredible, some of my favorites were Stay With Me, On The Steps Of The Palace, Giants In The Sky, I Know Things Now, No One Is Alone, and the Prologue. The Princes absolutely nailed Agony. I had a couple of issues with the movie, mainly all in the ending. The ending was very rushed, even though some songs were taken out. Rapunzel did not die or go insane, but lives happily with her prince instead. The reprise of Agony was removed, although *START OF SPOILER* Cinderella's prince still had an 'affair' with the baker's wife. *END OF SPOILER* When Little Red Ridinghood was swallowed by the wolf, the way that was done was a bit cheesy. All in all, on a scale from 1-10, I'd give it a 9. It was very good, especially since Into The Woods is a tough show to put on. (My cousin was the witch in her school's production) Anyways, I hoped this helped!",0,0,Maddi,7pjy5MK1X70,0.11477005073779266,2014-12-29 22:50:49,False,True

2015-05-04T16:31:33,Just for all you movie watchers. Disney did not come up with this. So stop saying Disney running out of ideas. This was a stage production written over 20 years ago. Disney decided turn it into a movie. So if you are not a fan of stage musicals (which is 80 percent singing) why would you come see this. You would have to be a person who appreciate the fine arts and actually thought out storylines to like this particular production. And btw. This singing in the stage production wasnt all that great either. Bernadette Peters was pretty much the best singing in the stage production. So i think they actually did better with the singing here. Except for johnny depp. ,0,1,Robert Richardson,7pjy5MK1X70,0.37037037037037035,2015-05-04 16:31:33,False,False

The ability to sing is the ability to express a thought in a more exciting and thrilling way. No matter what musical it is, no matter who is singing, no matter how much people sing you should learn to live in those moments. In my opinion Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, James Corden, Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, Johnny Depp, Daniel Huttlestone, and Lilla Crawford were an outstanding collection of everything in a movie musical. Thrill, love, passion, sadness, music, happiness, and delight.
