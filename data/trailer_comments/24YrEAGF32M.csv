2019-02-16T10:47:56,"To all the people saying this is basically The Fault in Our Stars: instead of pointing out stupid similarities like, yeah they're ALL sick and probably someone will die, and they fall in love. But can't you simply enjoy the damn movie??? Can't you see the struggle??? They can't touch!!! Hazel and Augustus were able to hug, to kiss, to even hold hands, but Will and Stella??? They're not allowed to do that!! Damn, six feet apart from the person you're in love with can be one of the most painful things ever...  Augustus was ""cancer free"" (or at least, they thought he was), he ""survived"". The same with Isaac and Patrick, for example. They saved themselves, they won. But CF has no cure. Even if you get new lungs it will only give you a few more years. But not a normal life.  That's the issue here: they all know they won't survive CF. They all know that's their curse, their fate; die young, die too young because you're sick. And, as if being a walking corpse (that's probably how Will would call it) wasn't enough torture... They fall in love with their own death.   They have to choose between living as much as they can while their lungs are slowly dying... But apart.   Or living happy, enjoying the time they have left together and doing the one thing they're asking for.   Is it really living when you're not enjoying your life?? When you're still breathing bc if not, other ppl would be sad?? Devastated???   Is it really living if you only wake up because you HAVE to wake up??   And, of course, the real part of all this: why do these stories exist???   John Green met Esther Grace Earl years ago at a Harry Potter convention. They became friends, really good friends.  ...Esther died the 3 of August, when she was 16 years old and her lungs cancer won.  John Green wanted to give her a bit more, as Hazel would say, he wanted more numbers for Esther Grace Earl.   Justin met Claire Wineland via YouTube, I suppose: she was a youtuber, yeah. She posted videos about her life, about CF and about herself.   Claire was deeply in love with life. You'd never hear her trying to avoid the fact of dying, because she knew she wasn't going to live as much as her friends. Claire was pure and complete sweetness and positivity. You really should go and watch her videos.   Claire Wineland left us a couple months ago (sorry, can't remember the exact date). This is her legacy.   So please, stop comparing two beautiful women, two beautiful stories just to make Five Feet Apart look less important. I'm asking you as a reader, as a fan of them both and as a freakin' human being. You can't compare death to see if Claire's was more tragic than Esther's or vice versa.

The only thing about this movie's story is the question of which one dies first and it's disgusting. Want to cry over something that's really heartbreaking? Go to a children's hospital and see the 5-15 year olds with the same diseases that may never grow old enough to see this movie. These movies milk real illnesses and romanticise death and sickness as if it's 'fun' and not absolute hell. Give the money you would use for the movie ticket and donate it to a cancer research foundation or hospital where the money can be used for real people who are really dying instead of another greedy film corporation hellbent on milking the same old story for money.,0,4,The Village Idiot,24YrEAGF32M,0.06333333333333334,2019-02-17 14:26:16,True,True

2019-02-18T22:44:36,"I have CF. My concern with this movie is that it seems to be so heavily dramatizing the health of those of us with Cystic Fibrosis as if our entire lives are either spent 'throwing all caution to the wind' or living completely obsessed with CF every second of every day, as if the disease is what defines us as people.  Yes, I do 3 hours of treatments and take over 100 pills each day. Yes I spent my teenage years thinking I wouldn't live past 25. Yes I'll likely die decades earlier than my family and friends.   But all those things also made me a really interesting person with beautiful perspectives on life. I used all those hours doing treatments every day teaching myself skills so I now run my own business. I have an incredible and supportive wife and great friends. I am not my disease, and have a LOT to live for.     I'm really glad this film is bringing awareness to the disease (more awareness = more money for CF research = closer to a cure) but I'm afraid the heavy dramatization and romanticizing of two CF teens making really foolish decisions as if that's what it means to ""live life fully"" may just contribute to the idea that those of us with CF are nothing beyond our disease.

It’s a widely varied generic disorder and much of the time they can totally be within 5 feet of each other.

2019-02-26T03:20:31,"WANT TO MAKE THOUSANDS FAST??? JOIN OUR MAIL CLUB I PROMISE YOU WONT REGRET THIS! AND YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE!     It’s not hard to make money!    How To Turn Six Dollars Into Six Thousand Dollars: I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little while back I was browsing    through newsgroups just like you are now and came across an article similar to this that    said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of    $6.00! So I thought ""Yeah right this must be a scam"" but like most of us I was curious    so I kept reading. Anyway it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and    address stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of    the list at #6 and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No    catch that was it. So after thinking it over and talking to a few people first I thought    about trying it. I figured: ""what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00 right?""    Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... within 7 days I started getting    money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon but the money just kept    coming in. In my first week I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had    made a total of over $1000.00! In the third week I had over $10000.00 and it's still    growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42000.00 and    it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00 and 6 stamps I have spent more    than that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most importantly WHY it    works... Also make sure you print a copy of this article NOW so you can get the    information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly    that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so    easy!    Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download it.) Follow the    simple directions and watch the money come in!    It's easy. It's legal. And your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage)    IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk -    it really works!    If all of the following instructions are adhered to you will receive extraordinary dividends.    PLEASE NOTE:    Please follow these directions EXACTLY and $50000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60    days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the    participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions.    You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your product is not    solid and tangible it's a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many    large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However the money made    from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from people like you and    me asking to be included in that list.    Here are the 4 easy steps to success:    STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper    ""PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST."" Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE    inside    EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent    thievery). Next place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should    now have 6 sealed envelopes each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase your    name and address and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS    ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for    it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it    all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed    that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:  I am slowly trying to switch this over to a Cash App thing for millennials! and to rid of the postage cost! and so much mail! So that is why some is Cash App and some is Regular Mail.  I still want to give the regular mailers what due to them!    #1) J. Linley    4324 Beechgrove Dr.    Grove City, OH 43123    #2) https://cash.me/$only1casso    #3) https://cash.me/$john    #4) https://cash.me/$jessica    #5) https://cash.me/$doloveexsist    #6) https://cash.me/$daniel    STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above move the other names up    (6 becomes 5 5 becomes 4 etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list.    STEP 3: Change anything you need to but try to keep this article as close to original as    possible. Now post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are    close to 24000 groups) All you need is 200 but remember the more you post the more    money you make! You won't get very much unless you post like crazy.    This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the    Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and whenever you need    money you can use it again and again.    PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty and    integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this    way. If you are of integrity the program will continue and the money that so many others    have received will come your way.    NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you either on a computer    or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are truly    providing a service. (Also it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to    reduce the risk of mail theft.)    So as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed six members will be    reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar each. Your name will    move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will    be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for    each of the first six people listed above) Send it now add your own name to the list and    you're in business!    ---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------    Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put    your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this    document and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the    computer's memory.    Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page.    From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so    that you can add your name to the list.    Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your postings in    different settings you'll always have this file to go back to.    Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various newsgroups    (on-line forums message boards chat sites discussions.)    Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message by highlighting    the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject this will    be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a    particular group click the post message button. You're done with your first one!    Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post    away after you get the hang of it it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup!    **REMEMBER THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN THE MORE MONEY YOU    WILL MAKE!    BUT :    YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** That's it! You will begin receiving money from    around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large    amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous you can invent a name to    use as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE    CORRECT.**    Now each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings    each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5 that is    another $25.00 for me now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4    and only 5 replies each I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now those 125 persons turn    around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each I    will make an additional $625.00! OK now here is the fun part each of those 625 persons    post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies    that just made me $3125.00!!! Those 3125 persons will all deliver this message to 200    newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will    receive $1562500! With an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name    is no longer on the list you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups and send out    another $6.00 to names on the list putting your name at number 6 again. And start    posting again. The thing to remember is: do you realize that thousands of people all over    the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are    now!! So can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... People have said    ""what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the    chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest    people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a    try? Estimates are at 20000 to 50000 new users every day with thousands of those    joining the actual internet. Remember play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work! Youll Be Glad You Made The Effort !",1,0,Random ASMR,24YrEAGF32M,0.1583627087198516,2019-02-26 03:20:31,True,True

2019-02-26T07:34:37,"I have Cystic Fibrosis. I’m happy that the name Cystic Fibrosis is getting some awareness, but I highly doubt this movie will show any of y’all what it’s actually like to live with CF.  I, for one, haven’t worn an oxygen tube since I was 6 years old. I’m going on 18 in a few months. Also, I haven’t been hospitalized since I was 12 years old. I’m extremely healthy for what I have, and so I can live a near-normal life.  Treatments and pills are pretty standard. I take 50 pills every day, eat 5+ meals everyday, complete an hour of physical treatments everyday, and get regular cardio exercise in too.  What this movie won’t show you is the nasty side of CF. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been embarrassed by my disease. There have been times where I’ve been in social situations, coughed once or twice in my arm, only to pull it back and see that I just coughed up half a lung’s worth in mucus. I’ve also had bathroom emergencies in public restrooms that are not unlike what the LA Beast went through when he ate gummy bears and kombucha (just look up LA Beast gummy bears and skip to the end of the video, and you’ll see what I mean). I’ve also passed out in front of people during outdoor activities in the summer, because my cells reject 70-80% of the salt I take in, so I get dehydrated very easily. In fact, that is the root cause of CF, and is why my body produces so much mucus.  It’s not cute or romantic in any way, shape, or form. Also, I never go near any other CFers. In fact, if two CFers find out they’re closer than 6 feet apart from each other, they acknowledge it with a head-nod, and then run screaming in opposite directions.",0,0,CamoHorse,24YrEAGF32M,0.042431129476584034,2019-02-26 07:34:37,True,True

2019-03-08T23:25:34,**Spoiler** I read the book here’s a summary. So the way they meet is Stella peers into a hospital room and sees Will and thinks he’s pretty cool. Then she finds out he’s letting his friends do it in his bed. She’s disgusted and runs away and Will follows and introduces himself. We later find out that Stella’s older sister died in a skydiving incident. Then Stella and Will start taking their medication together and start to fall in love. Then they go on a date and they hold a pool rod on either side so they stay five feet apart. Then they throw a party for Wills 18th birthday. Then Stella’s childhood best friend Poe has a heart attack and dies. Then Will and Stella go on a frozen lake and it breaks sending Stella under. Will pulls her out and gives her cpr. They both wake up in the hospital and Stella can get new lungs but she has to stay away from Will now. 8 months later they run into each other at the airport and they walk up to each other.

How did Will and Stella meet, what was their first meeting like (were his friends there who show up later), and did we get any more background info on them and their diseases?

2019-03-27T02:59:47,"SPOILER ALERT!!!      Just saw this movie today and man it hit me in the feels. First off, Poe’s death was really really sad, though I could kinda tell it was coming when that nurse was slow to answering the door. I wish they would’ve touched more on her reaction to that  When Stella steps onto the ice, my entire theater gasped for air, and I tell you, those next 5-10 minutes were so tense because we all knew what was gonna happen, but still they pulled it off so well. I like how they initially subverted expectations by them getting off, but then she falls off that little bridge thing, and even then, waited a little longer before going under. Well played movie.  Lastly, right after when Will saves Stella and gives her mouth to mouth, knowing that it’d kill him was really touching. After the transplant and he gives her that book, and sets up the lights, as a straight dude, found it surprising that I was getting close to tears. I like the somewhat open ending where instead of showing Will straight up die, they just had him walk away.   A great movie imo, highly recommend for a date night, so guys, bring your girls and some tissues haha",0,0,FPG Matthew,24YrEAGF32M,0.12038847117794486,2019-03-27 02:59:47,False,True

All disease is an imbalance in the body caused by putting the wrong things in the body in the first place , we are not designed to eat most of what we eat or Drink.  You can find help through  Dr Robert Morse , Dr Spira- mucousless diet and others if you check on YouTube  It will not be an easy journey but is completely curable  First step distill your water , do not smoke , intermittent fasting and eat only mucousless foods and high alkaline diet ,  You can find the mucousless foods list in The mucousless diet healing system book by Dr Arnold Ehret and also information on it with Prof Spira on YT as one of his followers.  Here's a basic list to begin :  Home water distiller  Food :  Cooked Sweet potatoes,  Squash and  all veg  All raw fruit and salad  Baked fruits  Fresh fruit juice  If your not in an emergency you can transition slower as the book explains.  The illness is going to be made worse by the back up mucous in the lungs so the diet and pure water are imperative for you healing.

All well-being is emotional joy made physical. All death is fine, because there is no such thing as death, just a soul re-joining the non-physical, and all the attention humans give to things makes them grow, because all that is physical is called into being by attention being put upon a Thing. If you put lots of attention on diseases, you get more diseases and more people with diseases. If you put your attention on well-being and happy people, you see more well-being and happy people. The universe is composed of what we put our attention on most of the time. Does the human race still think wallowing around in a problem fixes a problem? There is not one iota of evidence that swirling in a problem fixes a problem, it only makes the problem grow. The only thing that makes the world better is putting attention on GOOD things, and on solutions. Seriously, this information has been 'out there' for at least 20 years, when is the dumb world going to catch on to these obvious truths? You put all your attention on young people having and dying of diseases, guess what you get? More young people getting and dying of diseases! D'uh. People.

2019-06-16T01:59:35,I’m 64 and a retired RN. My speciality was Pulmonary. I worked at the main Baylor Hospital in Dallas. We had a couple that met in the CF clinic. They were young and regulars on our floor. They had two rooms but if we missed one we just looked in the others room. We would find them in bed together watching a movie. I have not seen this movie. But BREAKS MY HEART! After years of taking care of them he got really sick and was put on a vent. He was weaned off the vent. She never left his side. I was there when we coded him and he did not make it. She went home. Fell into depression and starved her self until she passed as well. She never would return to the hospital. It was the saddest day ever for there care givers. We all cried a lot after the lost. If you only knew the laughter the goofy times the scary times! The pain of this love story? It’s just so painful. I don’t know if I can watch the movie,0,0,beth bullock,24YrEAGF32M,-0.08306878306878307,2019-06-16 01:59:35,False,False

We ""went"" for drives tho, and the closest we could get was to hold hands (or awkward but glad hugs!) , Which changed a week ago when i somehow managed to bring her to my place, i was home alone and up for the risk of getting caught since i had to move 6000 miles from her for studies, all i wanted was one day. It was a fun day, she was there for a few hours and we watched this movie, i didn't know what it was about (human touch! That I'd soon be missing, her's... The only one i need). Even after 3 years of the relationship, I was still nervous to hold her hand during the movie, But i did and she put her head on my shoulder after a while, it was like breathing for the first time. The movie ended and it left her quietly sobbing on my shoulder, asking me to stay. I held her in my arms and close wasn't close enough. Talked to her to calm her down and... She did, eventually. I held her face and kissed her forehead, we then kissed for the first time, told that her that we'll be fine and make it work, she kissed me again and i won't ever forget her lips, sweeter than cherry. It gets alone in here and not an hour goes by that i don't think about her, Sometimes when I'm walking, i look up at the sky and say to my self that at least were under the same sky.
