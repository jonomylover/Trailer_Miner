All I got to say ab...out this is where in the blueberry muffin nut berries is Officer Damien, where is Cyril Raffelli?  Don't get me wrong, Paul looks like he plays this part well and commits to it naturally but still when I see this I see don't see anything other than a straight up remake of District B-13.  Oh well, at least they managed to keep in and cast the father of Park'our himself Mister David Belle himself reprising himself as the same character he played in the French version.  And from what I saw in the trailer it almost looks like that Rza's character, Brick Mansions, the main villain looks almost more fleshed out than in the French version.  At least in this movie that more of the other members of the crew have a little more flesh and life breathed into them (in the original District B-13 movie the only Taj henchmen that had life was K-2 played by the late Tony Amarro...I think that is how he spell his name.)  And to their credit it does look like that Paul Walker's character and David Belle have more of a chemistry for playing off of each other than Cyril and Belle in the original.

I mean, I know I'm suppose to feel sympathy for Paul Walker and all (who died 3 months ago in a car accident) because this is his last movie (I don't know how much of him is gonna be in F&F7) and believe me I am. His death was a tragic loss but lets put that aside, be serious and talk about the movie. I'm up for an American remake of B13. Of course, same plot and characters but that's not what the original movie was about so that's ok. It was about action sequences and stunts. Looking at the trailer not only are they remaking the movie but they're replicating all the awesome stunts (and possibly reusing some scenes) from the original. This is STUPID! Even the remake of The Karate Kid had different fighting moves than the original. If they're gonna remake B13, at least choreograph different fight scenes. We don't need to see the same parkour moves or fighting style, we just want action. However it is choreographed is fine with me (as long as it's different) because it could be just as awesome (if not better) than the original. David Belle's English is bad to but that's forgivable. The problem with remakes is that they replicate everything in the original without changing enough to stand on it's own and this is gonna be one of those POINTLESS remakes. I know that sounds ignorant (because the movie isn't even out yet) but the trailer gave everything away and that's never a good sign!",0,14,baole58,4CzcsN4k9FM,0.01535087719298246,2014-03-17 01:52:10,True,True
