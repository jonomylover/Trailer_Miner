2018-11-03T00:54:57,"30% of comments: “Hey, this looks fun!”  70% of comments: Complaining about the pigeon  Yeah, I know a lot of people are disappointed that Sterling turned into a bird in the end, but honestly, I think that’s the least of it’s worries! You’ve gotta keep in mind that Blue Sky has made plenty of films that aren’t actually about birds! There’s the Ice Age pentology! And there’s Robots! I bet you forgot that existed! There was Horton Hears a Who, Epic, Ferdinand, and the Peanuts Movie! I mean, just because there were birds in these movies doesn’t automatically mean that they’re about birds! I mean, think about it! Ice Age was about the Ice Age, Robots was about robots, Horton Hears a Who was about an elephant, Epic was about tiny forest fairies, and Ferdinand was about a bull! Really, come to think about it, the only other film Blue Sky made that was actually about birds was Rio! And Rio 2, of course, but you knew that! With that in mind, we do still have to look at Spies in Disguise with an open mind! Remember that this is only the first trailer! When more trailers come out, it might reveal to be more than just a bird movie in DISGUISE as a spy movie! The bird thing likely won’t be the entire plot! I think it will only be a small part of it! I think the biggest issue with this film so far would be the plot! Although it’s well paced and looks like a lot of fun, it does sorta feel like the typical spy movie that you would expect, so it kinda feels a tiny bit generic in that sense! But I’m gonna give this film a chance, and you should too! The guy at the end does make a good point after all! There are a lot of pigeons in the city, and nobody would suspect one of being a spy! Also note that the title of the movie is “Spies in Disguise” which does have a nice ring by itself, but if you think about it, actually goes pretty well with this trailer’s ending, and it’s pretty clever! Think about it, the SPY is in DISGUISE of the pigeon, let that one sink in! Just some food for thought!",32,22,Daniel Ippolito,C5YeOc0N6Ao,0.07743524774774775,2018-11-03 00:54:57,True,True

But how 'bout that scream though? Yeah! That's do that twice too!   Ugh! It's honestly hard to form a real opinion on this movie because this trailer is so awful. I mean you've got Will Smith as a super spy in a 3D animated movie that looks like every other 3D animated movie out there. And the twist is it's The Shaggy Dog, but with a pigeon instead. So, I think I'm going to go out on limb and say that much like every other movie that did the human-gets-turned-into-an-animal plot, it might be entertaining for 2 minutes and then it's going to be agony waiting for it to be over. Lemme guess! At the end, there will be a funny scene where the thirsty female pigeon gets turned into a human.

2018-11-03T13:45:15,"Much like everyone else in the comments, I don't really appreciate the fact that a regular spy movie starring two phenomenal actors is just going to end up being another stupid bird movie. However, I am going to give Blue Sky here a look into what the movie should end up being if they want their movie to be enjoyed by more than just kids. Perhaps try not having Lance be stuck as a bird through the entire movie. What could happen is that Walter and Lance meet after Walter turns Lance into a pigeon. Lance, as a pigeon, is forced to remain in Walter's apartment as Walter attempts to invent a machine to turn him back. Lance sees the many inventions Walter has created and, impressed by his genius, suggests to his agency to recruit the young scientist when he returns to them after having been turned back. Due to Lance being the greatest spy ever, they would listen to him and investigate the young genius. The rest of the movie could be Walter shadowing Lance and learning to be a spy, as well as increasing his knowledge of inventing. Perhaps the conflict of the movie isn't that they don't work well together, like other movies. It could be that they work great together, right from the beginning, but Walter's inventions always mess up their missions in some way, slowly threatening Lance's reputation. When Walter is forced to quit, perhaps the spy's opposing enemy goes to recruit Walter, and they use his inventions to attempt to take down the spy organization. So when they go to take them down, they aren't aware that they didn't give Walter enough time to work and perfect his inventions, thus causing them to backfire onto the enemy. This causes Walter to be praised as a hero, and he and Lance can go on to be the greatest spy duo in history.",1,1,Irradiated Cactus,C5YeOc0N6Ao,0.18332010582010583,2018-11-03 13:45:15,True,True

Hmmm, this might be all right But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that Is this the type of place that they should sent this cool cat?
