It could be Paul and ringo as they are the two members still alive however Ringo didn‚Äôt write the songs, or at least he didn‚Äôt contribute anywhere near enough as John to be called a writer.

2019-06-03T23:18:55,"This movie has a nice premise, but in reality, it was more than the music that made the Beatles. For instance, in 1963, Del Shannon played in England with the Beatles. When ""From Me to You"" made it to #1 in the UK, Shannon got permission from John Lennon to record the song and release it in America since no one knew the Beatles here who knows if they would have made in America anyway. This was a way to promote the group in America. In June 1963, Del Shannon released the song and it only made it to #77 on the Billboard charts. If you listen to the song, he copied the Beatles version almost note by note. So it goes to show you ... as great and the songs are, it was more that made the Beatles who and what they became. So if they never existed like this movie states. it is doubtful that someone with their songs would be anywhere close to what the Beatles were.

2019-08-10T15:10:41,"I am currently 31 years old as I was born on March 10, 1988 (my favorite music artist of all time in the world are the Beatles, and I am the biggest Beatles fan in the world, and I know everything about the Beatles), and I have been seeing a lot of movies lately this year such as Pokemon: Detective Pikachu which I saw twice, Shazam!, Toy Story 4 which I saw twice, Aladdin, Spider-Man Far From Home, Men In Black International, The Lion King which I saw twice, and Yesterday which I saw twice.  Since I am a Pokemon fan, and a Beatles fan I wanted to find out if anybody worked on both Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, and Yesterday, and 13 people worked on both of those movies.  I have been going to a Drive-In Movie Theater about 30 minutes away from my house because my ears are over sensitive to sound because I have Autism (Asperger Syndrome which the Creator of Pokemon Satoshi Tajiri also has), and it shows double features so the first time I went there this year I saw Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, and Shazam!, the second time I went there this year I saw Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, the third time I went there this year I saw Toy Story 4, and Aladdin, the fourth time I went there this year I saw Spider-Man Far From Home, and Men In Black International, and the fifth time I went there this year I saw The Lion King on Thursday, July 18, 2019, and the advertised release date was Friday, July 19, 2019, and movies are actually released the day before the advertised release dates.  Also my Mom had made a deal with me that if she went with me to a Drive-In Movie Theater to see Pokemon: Detective Pikachu which she did that I would have to go with her to a regular Movie Theater where we could be almost all the way in the back, and I could wear ear plugs as I do in places that are loud, and if it would be too loud for me we could leave, and not get a refund so on the advertised release date of Friday, July 19, 2019 my Mom, and I went to a regular Movie Theater to see The Lion King, and it was not too loud except for some of the trailers, and I had to keep on adjusting my ear plugs during the movie for the loud parts, and the parts where I could barely hear the talking, but I did not have to do that a lot so I ended up seeing The Lion King for the first 2 days that it was released in Movie Theaters, and my Mom, and I went again to the same regular Movie Theater on Saturday, July 20, 2019 for a second day in a row to see Yesterday where I had to adjust my ear plugs every now, and then because of the loudness, and when the talking was very low, and my Mom, and I went again to the same regular Movie Theater on Sunday, July 21, 2019 for a third day in a row to see Toy Story 4 as it was the only date for any movies there where it would be Sensory Friendly for the kids where the sound would be turned down, the lights would stay on, and the kids could be as loud as they want to express themselves, but I still wore ear plugs that day too as I did not know how much lower the sound would be turned down, and then on Tuesday, July 23, 2019 I went to the same regular Movie Theater again with my new Mentor Annie (she is South Korean, and she was born in Seoul, South Korea, and she bleaches her hair mostly green with some natural black hair too, and her 33rd birthday is today) so she could see Yesterday, but she asked my Mom if she would like it as she is not really a Beatles fan, and my Mom said even Non-Beatles fans would like it, and she did like it.  So my Mom was trying to get me to go to a regular Movie Theater for more than 25 years, and I ended up going to a regular Movie Theater 4 times in 5 days.  Also because of concerts being too loud too I never go to concerts except to Paul McCartney concerts, and Ringo Starr concerts where I have seen 6 Paul McCartney concerts, and I have seen Ringo Starr twice in concert, and both of those concerts were also part of the 6 concerts I saw Paul McCartney in, and for my first 5 Paul McCartney concerts which were also part of the 2 times I saw Ringo Starr in concert I saw Paul McCartney in New York City as I was born there, and I used to live there for almost the first whole 28 years of my life, and for my 6th, and final Paul McCartney concert I saw Paul McCartney in Syracuse, New York which is about an hour, or so away from my current house.",0,0,volcanion,Ry9honCV3qc,0.0697071521668296,2019-08-10 15:10:41,False,True

2019-08-17T06:42:17,"My only gripe about the movie is that the guitar in the Yesterday scene didn‚Äôt need to be tuned at all. That makes no sense. First of all guitars are completely out of tune when you get them. It‚Äôs safe to assume she tuned the guitar before hand but the standard tuning is EADGBE but Yesterday is played in D standard or DGCFAD. There is no way Jack could have picked up his new guitar and just start jamming Yesterday and have it be in tune. The only explanation is that the girl tuned to D standard but no one does that normally. Not to mention that I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs never stated in the movie that she is musically intelligent. Sure she can sing but there are people who can just sing without teaching. The only explanation for it is that she has perfect pitch a talent that‚Äôs only seen in kids where they can tell the note instantly from hearing it. Yet if she had perfect pitch you‚Äôd think she‚Äôd be more musically based rather than a manager in the movie. Now that I think about it no wonder Jack is a failing musician, not once in the movie is he seen or heard tuning his guitars. Sure it‚Äôd be boring to watch but it makes sense within its universe. Stage scenes are fine somewhat because you tune before the show but even then most musicians who play guitar check the tuning constantly so they don‚Äôt fall out of tune. Jack doesn‚Äôt do this, he just plays. Now you‚Äôre probably saying you‚Äôre just nitpicking at this point tuning isn‚Äôt important or integral to the actual story, and you‚Äôd be 100% right, it is me nitpicking. I fucking love this movie but they couldn‚Äôt even mention tuning by name or something? Most movies don‚Äôt but come on now it‚Äôs one of if not the most basic yet important step when it comes to playing guitar, or any other stringed or tune-able instrument.",0,3,Algernon,Ry9honCV3qc,0.23824984539270255,2019-08-17 06:42:17,False,True

Which would mean the music styles inspired by this work could not have come up.  The work done by the Beatles back in the 1950s and 1960s made it possible for a lot of music to come up. Without them, important key stones in the development of our world would be missing. Bands like Oasis and singers like Ed Sheeran would have never vome up. Music would not have evolved. The British Invasion of the Beatles, i.e. their influence on the USA also changed the culture over there.  The Beatle-Mania was an important factor for a youth culture to develop in UK and the rest of the Western World. The creativity and inspiration laid the basis for the trememndous social changes in the 1960s. It is possible that by missing out the Beatles, the Flower Power movement had never happened. Without that youth culture, our world would not have become as advanced.  Take out Steve Jobs and you have no Apple. Take out Bill Gates and Microsoft - boom - no internet and hence no Youtube and no IT world.

Half the songs written after 1962 would not exist because, many songs were inspired, intentionally or not, by the Beatles songs. And probably wouldn't have been any bands like Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd or, in any case, they would have made very different songs. Moreover Beatles were an integral part of the youth culture and of the protests of the 60s. Even the present society would have been different.

2020-04-18T18:25:26,"One Major Plot Hole. It is almost impossible that in 50 years not one other musician came up with similar music/lyrics as The Beatles catalog. Given the depth that the direction the movie takes in the alternate time line;  it would be quite likely that those very lyrics/music would NOT be popular and sell. One might point out that cigarettes did not exist either and no one ever 'thought' of them. Tobacco is a singular item; where music is a combination of an incredible number of separate pieces. Again, if no other musician EVER came up with the combinations of lyrics/music of The Beatles there is no reason to think it would be popular and sell but rather a 'screeching sound' to the masses and undesirable.",0,0,Studio DaVeed,Ry9honCV3qc,0.16944444444444443,2020-04-18 18:25:26,False,False
