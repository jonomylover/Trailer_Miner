2018-02-13T20:55:05,"This is actually a really cool, interesting and genuinely frightening concept done with great execution so far. There's something about pure silence that creates a feeling of tension and unease, and if the movie plays its cards right it could easily teach the audience to associate the breaking of silence with danger in the movie, creating a feeling of tension and foreboding during silence and extreme fear and terror when it's broken. It's also really cool seeing the world this trailer presents, and how it shows the way the survivors of whatever mysterious apocalypse occurrd have adapted. It also really helps my impression of the movie that the trailer doesn't use any jumpscares or reveal the monster in the last frame or anything stupid like that (though it does have the overused cliche of trailers having a ""beat"" sound effect that's supposed to build tension but really just takes away from the atmosphere, which is why I prefer the other trailer where the quiet lasts longer a little more).",0,0,Gamedragon bro,WR7cc5t7tv8,0.10456349206349211,2018-02-13 20:55:05,True,True

Her parents are gone and she has to learn how to survive on her own and not become the next meal for the creatures. She finds a baby girl and she and Baby live in the basement of her home and they communicate through sign language. After six years Amy and Baby are rescued and taken to New Hope where survivers are brought. Everything seems to be wonderful but Amy gradually realizes that the humans might be worse than the creatures outside. There is a sequel to this book it is titled ""In The End"".

And his parents let him keep it?! In one Scene you see the little boy playing with the toy, look carefully. You see the father carrying one kid, and then the mother had the daughter, and then the boy with the toy. That's five ppl. And in the rest of the trailer, you see only 4 ppl. So I'll bet you HE died.  Also, What if you sneez? Or fart? Or get sick? You just DIE instantly? Lol, I already hear the ppl in the theater smacking, and crunching, and russling, they're popcorn bags. Ugh 😒  Howwww is the mother going to have a KID without screaming in pain? I think there's no way that will happen, so it's safe to assume she dies too.  ""What about the baby?"" Asked some of you. Probably. What if there was an exciting twist where the baby didn't cry?? And the monster adoptied him/her??? Okay, I'm getting too far ahead of myself, let's move on.  The Dad.... Smh. The Dad is SO wrong in all kinds of ways! How did he get the mom pregnant? (Lowkey we all know HOW but... 😉) The Dad let the kid have that toy, and he (probably) dies! He gets the mom pregnant, and now Her AND the Baby (more than likely) die! He's gonna be all by himself by the end of the movie. And he Ain't finna start a NEW family! Cuz ain't no women in the World gonna marry a Man that lives in a haunted house! Unless he lies and says otherwise.  Now.... The big Guns. *bang* *bang* *I'm so stupid* The Monster. Idk what the heck this thing is! Why did it choose THIS family to haunt? Was the family just unlucky or is there ACTUALLY a story behind it? I guess I just gotta watch and see. 😉  Welp, I think I covered everything.

It's a silent film just not in black and white. Since I don't know sign language it would have been nice to have subtitles. If the little boy has been living in silence for 89 days why would he even consider turning on the toy rocket ship? He knew they were being quiet for a reason. Who decides to get pregnant during an apocalypse??? If you have be quiet to survive wouldn't a newborn defeat that purpose all they do is cry. No one saw that giant nail sticking out of the stairs? If they can't hear you when you're by the waterfall why didn't you just live there? Sighs. Idk why they are hyping this movie up and lying to people. If this movie scares you, I highly suggest you don't watch goosebumps or are you afraid of the dark. Those will give you nightmares.

The ending was also a little meh, but that's the last few seconds. Otherwise the film was brilliant and had you on the edge of your seat the whole way through with loads of unexpected turns.

The parts of the movie that were shown were enjoyable but I have 3 complaints.  1. Way to short. The movie was barely an hour long and they definitely had room to fill. 2. Lack of a proper introduction. The movie starts 3 months into the “invasion.” Then jumped past a year. There is very little back story to what happened or where they came from. They do explain a bit in the newspapers but not many people will be able to read all of it while in theaters. They could have taken an extra 10 min with just a minor background. 3. The ending was god awful. They set up the conclusion so well. They found the weakness and later found out that they could be killed. Instead the dad died and the movie ends right before an epic battle.   This movie had potential and as much as I want to like it, I can’t say I do. Would I watch it again? No. Would I recommend it?

Little boy might not have died as one of them could’ve just thrown the toy in another direction -how did they have sex without making any sound louder than whispering.  -what was the girl thinking wondering into the woods by herself and staying there for ages. The aliens were blind but they could’ve ran into her or something she wouldn’t have been able to hear them anyway.  -Why didn’t the boy just walk back to the house after the fireworks.

Waters gonna make a sound no matter what.  -what if they snore -why didn’t the dad bring the shotgun when he went to save the kids -Ik the hearing aid ended up hurting  the aliens in the end but she didn’t know that earlier on and it was obviously hurting her so why didn’t she just take it off, it didn’t work anyway. -it might’ve made them feel better by having another baby but seriously would it be that worth it when your risking the family’s lives. Babies aren’t just gonna cry when there born there gonna cry for months and it will take them a while to learn to not to make any sound   Not dissing the film in anyway.

It's a man with apocalyptic clothing and gear and a giant gun with smoke emanating from the barrel. He is wearing a dirty cloth wrapped around his face with goggles. He slowly removes it to expose his face. The father looks up, dumbfounded and says with astonishment 'Dwight??' The man says confidently...'That creature is the most dangerous animal on the planet.

This is tbh the only horror film that I cried in! When the dad sacrificed himself I legit cried I was so freaking sad :( also when the old guy screamed because the other women was killed i just like died inside (I don’t really know what emotion I was feeling). Then when the boy died it was really freaking sad. Aside from that I was going to look away for a bit but I couldn’t resist watching it, I knew something scary was coming but I just couldn’t look away. (Also when the raccoon got smushed I jumped)   An annoying thing was that at least 50% of the movie was quiet so when a loud noise came it scared the heck out of me. But it wasn’t that bothering because hey! It’s a horror film!   Overall the movie was amazing and I clearly see why this was rated so good. Tbh I thought this was gonna be another one of those “horror films” that didn’t do so well but I really thought this was different and very clever. There aren’t many jump scares it’s just more like sudden sounds.

One day, while her parents were out, aliens invaded. They couldn’t see or smell, only hear. And their hearing was amazing. So, you had to be completely silent in order to be safe. The only difference is that in the movie, it’s entirely based around that, whereas in the book it’s about 1/4 of the way in and they find this place where scientists made this really loud sound that only the aliens can hear, and the aliens hate it.

So these creatures could hear anything from about 10 miles away ( give or take a few miles) which made no sense at all. They could travel long distances in a blink of a eye. They attacked anything that made a noise that was what I guess from the movie, a normal decible sound. I had to sit through this movie just to know how it ended and of course you can impair them with what else, high decibel sounds. Go figure. I guess the people that made this thing think we the audience have no brains. And the fact that our Military could not outwit these things and force them out in the open to kill them, that was just ass backwards to me.

Instead of tension or suspense I just felt uncomfortable throughout the whole first act from the lack of dialogue (and I mean none) and sound in general.  I could hear people around me chewing and breathing in the cinema.  The creature is just an obvious rip off of Venom from spider man.  Looks almost the same and even has a similar weakness, which as far as I can tell is.... feedback?? WTF?  Never mind the fact that any creature with such advanced hearing should be able to hear the main chicks heart beating when it is right next to her at one point with no other sound around them.   Several possibly interesting ideas were presented and then ignored.  Like how does a deaf kid, who we have to presume has always been deaf, even know when she is making noise?  What would that be like?  How would her experience differ from her families experience living in a silent world? Nope not interested.   I also find it next to impossible that any human being could be completely silent for so long.  Everyone needs to vent vocally and loudly from time to time from frustration and anger, and the waterfall scene would have been a good time to explore that.  Nope.    Sorry those two kids who fell into a grain silo are dead within minutes and one is never pulling the other out from under all that corn.  Through out the whole film I was just  asking ""why?""  Like why not whisper in each others ears from time to time?  Why does a gunshot bring out all the creatures but a fucking rocket and fireworks only alert the one in the immediate vicinity?  Why is a new born baby next to silent the whole time?  Does he already know the situation?  Who were the other people lighting fires near the middle of the movie?  Why was a creature, said to be indestructible in news papers, suddenly vulnerable when its ears hurt?  Why was the lead male so shit at acting?  Why would a quality actress like Blunt sign up for such a piece of shit?  Why do I still hope Hollywood is capable of making good horror and suspense films anymore?   I realize movies deserve some leeway when they are making fantasy films but this movie is just one frustrating piece of garbage in my opinion.",4,3,Craig Bone,WR7cc5t7tv8,-0.004683742183742183,2018-04-14 12:21:50,False,True

This movie had me at the edge of my seat and most horror movies don’t do that it also scared me a couple of times which also horror movies don’t do for me so I have to give this one a lot of praise because it does such that. The acting in this movie is phenomenal, the story is awesome and the special effects are great. I loved how the creatures looked something you have not seen much of and the way you have to be quiet or they can hear you. SPOILER: I thought that the birth scene was the most intense scene in the whole movie. There is no way a woman can be quiet giving birth to a baby and why would you even bring a child into that kind of world. I also thought that the creatures advantage was also its weakness that was cool, and when the dad died I choked up that scene was sad. The only thing I did not like was the ending come on, oh well it is still a great film. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do.

Nice, like a privaate showing:)  To tell the truth, I was pretty disappointed in this movie.  It could use work, a lot of work.  There are some things that go unanswered and some things that are just plain stupid. Not going to say anything and ruin it for others, but when you see it, you'll know.  It needs a lot of tweaking and someone in this group had an alternate ending that they made up, which I think is way better than the one here.  I'm a horror movie fan, and this one certainly did have parts that made me cringe and some that made me jump out of my chair.  One thing I hate in movies, any movie, is stupid women.  Why they make women stupid is beyond me, women aren't stupid at all.  If you go, go to a morning or afternoon matinee showing when it's cheaper.  Don't wait for the video to come out, it needs the big screen.  I'd generously give it 3 out of 5 stars.

At least make the space remotely soundproof, where they went to hide amplifies vibration and sound, like being in the basement of an empty house. Save your money!

The entire downstairs could be sound proofed yet they stick the baby in a sound proof box? Stupid. 5. The whole hearing aid frequency thing is stupid when she just blows it's head off at the end. They make out it was easier to kill becasue she messed with it's hearing yet they all pause and open their head up to detect prey - head shot FUCKING BOOM! 6. Every single bad thing that happened was a result of the kids not doing what they are told and being fucking retards. 7. The kid could have released the hand brake on the care earlier. 8 The father goes out screaming like a bitch instead of swinging that axe like a man and potentially winning the fight or at least inuring it. Stupid - Again. 9. They relied on fireworks they had to run and light rather than a simpler method to make noise like a long line to the house that set off an alarm etc - they had electricity.... 10. Why not set traps to dissuade them coming in or as early warning in the fields etc? 11. The stupidest thing is again the whole head opening BS.

Almost the entire movie is performed without spoken words.  The family uses simple sign language, so the subtitled dialogue is sparse, simple and quite inartistic.  Virtually no action or real sound for the first hour of the movie and no monster acting chops on display to  invoke real feeling for the characters (I am however a Blunt/Krasinski fan).  Seriously contemplated getting up and leaving before the end.  I'm an old guy, not some fan of gore fests or slasher movies, but this movie moved at such a snail's pace, that by the tmie there was some action, I was too irritated to enjoy it.",0,0,Gretschnut,WR7cc5t7tv8,0.10444444444444446,2018-04-30 03:13:03,False,True

I was so disappointed in everything.  First of all, they start at, what?, day 89?, the dad carried all of that sand in that stupid little back pack?  And, where the heck did he get it????  I didn't see a beach any where around.  And, they were in a drug store.  Pick up some condoms you big dummy!  If they knew there was a danger, why did they leave the little kid hanging back on the way from the drug store?  Did they want him picked off?????  Why did they only take 1 bottle of pills?  I would have cleaned them out of aspirin and other things, like bandages, antibiotics, etc.  Didn't that water in the tub gurggle on it's way out of the tub after she had the baby?  And, where the heck did that nail come from?  It was a new nail, not an old rusty one.  And, sticking straight up, too!  I've built stairs before, and there was never a nail in the middle of a step!  Why didn't someone step on it before???  Why didn't the mom say something about it?  Nope, she left it there so someone could step on it!  Oh gracious, it was her!  Why didn't it come out of the top of her foot?  It was huge!  I would have screamed my head off!  And, no swelling, infection, or anything????   When the father and son were going in different directions, mom sure didn't look preggers standing outside waving them off.   And, at the end, where the heck did all of that water come from flooding the basement?  And, where did it go, all of a sudden?  Why did she take so long to shoot that thing?  And, when they found out that a high pitched sound killed those things, why didn't they hie down to the local pet store and get some dog whistles?  And, what kind of father is going to leave a mother and 3 children to fend for themselves???  If he was good at building things, i.e., the hearing aid, why couldn't he have made a scarecrow, put in something to make a screeching sound along with a bomb that would go off on impact?  But, of all of the incongruities, that nail really ticks me off!  It was just stupid that it was there and no one stepped on it, EVER, except old mom, and she didn't do a thing about it.  There were so many more, like what's with that old man?  He wasn't necessary to the movie, but these really irritated me.

2018-05-04T19:43:22,"Love the below comment by Bishop Robert Barron in that he considers this as the ""most unexpectedly  religious films of 2018.""  ""I went to see A Quiet Place, John Krasinski’s new thriller, with absolutely no anticipation of finding theological or spiritual themes. I just wanted a fun evening at the movies. How wonderful when a film surprises you! I don’t know if I can find the golden thread that draws all of these themes together into a coherent message, but I think one would have to be blind not to see a number of religious motifs in this absorbing film.  The basic structure of the narrative is laid out in simple, deft strokes. We learn that a terrible plague of fierce, devouring creatures has descended on the earth. Where are the monsters from? Outer space, maybe? We’re never told—which makes the story more compelling. The few people who have survived the holocaust have learned that the creatures, though blind, are extraordinarily acute of hearing. Therefore, the key to survival is silence. Our attention becomes focused on the Abbot family, two youthful parents and three small children, making their quiet way through a beautiful but dangerous open country. When the youngest of the kids flips a switch on his toy rocket, causing buzzing sound to pierce the silence, one of the beasts devours him just before his terrified father can save him.   We flash-forward several months later, and we watch the Abbots (can the name have possibly been accidental?) going about their lives in what could only be characterized as a monastic manner: no conversations above a whisper, elaborate sign language, quiet work at books and in the fields, silent but obviously fervent prayer before the evening meal, etc. (I will confess that this last gesture, so thoroughly absent from movies and television today, startled me.) Given the awful demands of the moment, any gadgets, machines, electronic entertainment, or noisy implements are out of the question. Their farming is by hand; their fishing is done with pre-modern equipment; even their walking about is done barefoot. And what is most marvelous to behold is that, in this prayerful, quiet, pre-modern atmosphere, even with the threat of imminent death constantly looming, a generous and mutually self-sacrificing family flourishes. The parents care for and protect their children, and the remaining brother and sister are solicitous toward one another and toward their parents. The young girl even regularly risks her life to pay silent tribute to her fallen brother at the spot where he was killed.  Monsters and beasts in the more reflective horror movies are evocative of those things that frighten us the most: illness, failure, our own wickedness, death itself. How wonderful that a Hollywood movie would suggest that what is needed to keep the darkness at bay in our time is silence, simplicity, a return to the earth, prayer, and care for one another.   The central drama of A Quiet Place is that Mrs. Abbott is expecting a child. The entire family realizes, of course, that a wailing infant would, given the circumstances, mean almost certain death for all of them. And yet, they decide not to kill the child at his birth but to hide him and mute his cries in various ways. When so many in our culture are willing to murder their children for the flimsiest of reasons, when the law gives full protection even to partial-birth abortion, when people blithely say that they would never bring a baby into such a terrible world, the monastic family in this film welcomes life, even into the worst of worlds, and even when such an act is of supreme danger to them. As the baby is coming into the light, the mother finds herself alone (watch the film for the details) and in the most vulnerable situation, for one of the beasts has made its way into their house. As she labors to give birth, the devouring animal lurks. I was put immediately in mind of the scene in the book of Revelation, where Mary is in the throes of child birth as the dragon patiently waits to consume the child.   As the abbess is struggling to give birth, the abbot has gone in search of his endangered children. He finds them, to his horror, trapped in an abandoned car, one of the beasts clawing at them through the roof, like the T-Rex in Jurassic Park. After mouthing the words, “I love you; I have always loved you” to his daughter, who gapes at him through the car window, the father screams, drawing the monster to himself. This act of self-emptying love, which serves to liberate his children from danger, is beautifully evocative of the speculations of the Church Fathers regarding the death of Jesus. In his act of self-sacrifice on the cross, the fathers argued, Jesus lured the dark powers into the open and away from the human beings who had been in their thrall. Along similar lines, in an odd working of plot or Providence that can be likened to the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice, it becomes clear in the wake of the father's death that he has left behind for his family the means by which the monsters can be defeated.  I have no real idea whether any or all of this was in the mind of the filmmaker, but I do know from John Krasinski’s Wikipedia page that he is the son of a Polish-Catholic father and an Irish-Catholic mother and that he was raised a devout practicer of his faith. So until definitively shown otherwise, I am going to maintain that A Quiet Place is the most unexpectedly religious film of 2018.""",0,0,Shawn,WR7cc5t7tv8,0.09612152828444961,2018-05-04 19:43:22,False,True

2018-05-06T04:20:14,"the movie was amazing all throughout but the ending felt a bit short to me and couldve been stronger.  SPOILERS BELOW . z z z z z z z z z zz zz z zz  when the dad took the son out to the waterfall and taught him about the fish i thought that part would have more meaning later on in the movie..although it didnt. the son never got much character development as the girl, mom and dad, but still had several scenes dedicated towards him.   In the end the son is actually in the corner holding the baby while the mother and daughter fend off the monsters and thats about it. I felt the ending should've been different. Like this...(this is just my opinion I'm not saying it HAD to be like this)  So we have the ending they had but skip ahead in years. (Since the movie tend to skip time a lot it would make sense for ''tis to happen). The baby grew up to about a preteen and the son and daughter, were adults at this point. The son would take the boy to the same place his father once took him and would go to the fish just as he did before, when he was the baby's age. Then the baby (preteen now) gets frightened, but the son says ""It's alright we're safe here"" and done.   That's it. So the son has a stronger character and all ties meet. This ending scene will show the viewers that the son did learn from his father and will not only strengthen the sons character, but the dead father as well.   But other then that, this was a great movie to experience in the theatre as you felt you were in the same situation as the characters to stay quiet.

2018-05-16T17:03:46,"It's shit! Utter tripe of a movie. I saw it the last day it was in cinemas, thought I'd check it out due to the glowing reviews the movie received but the critics must have seen an entirely different film!    I usually like turning my mind off during a movie and try to get soaked into the world but the glaring plotholes throughout the entirety of the piece made it unbelievably difficult to do so.  There's a few problems listed in the comments so I'll try not to repeat them and also not try to spoil anything for you in case it's on Netflix and you're borderline about to stab your hand with a fork to feel something, I'll list a couple out:   - They live on a farm, a farm that grows corn. How in the world is one supposed to not just plant corn quietly but harvest it too?  - The boy and girl that fall into the silo of corn sink like one would in quicksand. Corn doesn't displace like fucking sand. The little bastard would have broken his legs falling 30ft into fucking corn. Modern day Scrooge McDuck shit.   - The waterfall part where the son and father are able to shout. Why not create a homestead there?  - Speaking of waterfalls, the aliens that have managed to travel to Earth (implying their aliens) with practically no vision, just the power of sound and they can't differentiate a waterfall to human speech? - This may be the single greatest plothole but the whole premise of fighting them with sound (I don't know if it was meant to be a plot twist because it was transparent as hell from minute 1) is more of a question than answer due to every single country failing to coming up with that solution. I mean, c'mon. They attack due to sound, in nature, one attacks due to a threat; in this case, it's sound. The aliens didn't eat the humans but killed them so it wasn't for sustinence, how fucking difficult can it be, I'm sure the 80 or something days before we're introduced to the family, one would notice that they don't fucking like noise. Could you imagine them in New York or something with all that sound everywhere, they'd trip out. Anyway, Up/Reduce the frequency of pitch and just blare it at the bastards. (Not sure if I'm right here but I'm guessing human's would be unable to hear such a low or high frequency meaning they'd be safe implying it's higher than ultrasound? Sound as a weapon has been a thing since the war, I'm sure the might of a global military could have the bastards killed and dissected by lunch) - What is the reason of this 'alien race' attacking the world? (Also the art direction of the monsters are priceless, giant human-esque ears? Priceless) - Fucking SAND? How witty and clever... fuck me - Not really a plothole but M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs' is The Usual Suspects compared to this fucking twist  - What is represented as aliens that have godly hearing can't deal with a defective hearing aid?  - I've probably written some spoilers but whatever. Did the wife know that the father was dead at the end. Handled it pretty well.  - As my mother can atest to, childbirth is pretty fucking painful let alone having her foot crucified by that fucking nail during her contractions - Why bring a child into this environment? Let alone a newborn not crying or burping or whatever upon birth. She brought a newborn into the world with one of those aliens 3 ft away. She and her baby should have been skewered.  - Not to bring up a patriarchial complex but the mother was strong as hell but still the maiden in distress? She had a silent fucking birth with an alien that will kill her if she makes a noise with a fucking nail lodged in her foot but needs the amazing John Krazinski (actor/director/fucking savior) to protect her?   Shit, may have gotten a little carried away but honestly I could go on for much longer. All in all, this was John Kranzinski's selfgratifying wank. You shouldn't waste your time watching this, there's a ton of movie tropes and there's no 'hiding behind the popcorn' moments. Y'think a  movie that has a premise involving sound could land some seriously atmospheric moments. Not once was I spooked.   If you want a good low-budget thriller, watch 'The Babadook', that's on Netflix too.",37,22,alZiiHardstylez,WR7cc5t7tv8,0.006405766852195417,2018-05-16 17:03:46,False,True

2018-06-21T22:13:36,"While I did enjoy this movie, it was not as good as its' predecessor- the other social thriller from 2017 ""Get Out"". Whereas Get Out's social commentary focused on racism, the theme here in a Quiet Place was the ""family"" and protecting your family at all costs. The movie started out slowly and picked up in the middle, it didn't feel much intense, but makes up for those shortcomings with the blood and gore in the movie. It's also not a complete silent movie, which is good. The weakness for the monsters wasn't well thought out, and the ending could've been better. There is intense music which alerts you when you need pay attention to the screen, they'll be a few times when you aren't paying attention because nothing's happening and there's no talking going on and the director knows some of us won't be focusing on the screen so they use the intense music to draw us in. I also think there's a problem with sub-standard writing- in some scenes the movie was all over the place, hoping quickly from one scene to another with little explanation given for of the characters decisions. The biggest flaw, imo, is the movie didn't attempt to explain where or why the aliens are here or where they came from, or what they are ie- aliens, monsters, demons, etc. 5/10 C.

2018-07-10T01:02:41,"the movie is... okay. interesting. not at all scary. okay. but also stupid. and some shit isn't explained and clear. like what about sneezing, farting, your shit hitting the water in the toilette, accidentally screaming (because you got scared or hurt), laughing - things we can't really control? and they can walk around and make sounds with other stuff buf can't even whisper? (yes I know they whispered in one or two scenes maybe but all of the other times they rely mostly on sign language) also, WTAF is wrong with these ""parents"". like, they walked god knows how many miles in the beginning of the movie and the youngest of their children was left to walk the last, behind all of them. even if it wasn't a post apocalyptic scenario, that is really dangerous. like, shit can happen to a fucking 4yo if you don't pay attention. you put the children in front of you goddamnit, so you see at all times what's going on. cause they should be more important than you, right?  then the getting pregnant part. like a lot of people already said - that's just really shitty. use a fucking condom, morons. not only is the world going to be a dangerous place for the baby but also, the baby is going to be dangerous for the world. babies communicate by fucking. crying. out. loud., legit. screaming. and still, the shit parents decide to boink without protection, not giving a shit about the danger they're bringing themselves, their children and their newborn in. like... the fuck seriously. especially after they already lost one child goddamnit. how bout keeping it in your pants for the sake of surviving... smh. ALSO, if I get a ""she was pregnant before the aliens came"" comment, you can suck right on it because she fucking wasn't. first day was 80 something and the aliens were already there AND KILLED THEIR SON. next day was 471 and she was pregnant. do the math guys. 470 days is a year and a half. can't be pregnant for that long. okay. also, when the father send his, what, 6-7yo son to light up some fireworks what the fuck lel? there are some weird killing creatures walking around and he sends his kid to do a preeetty adult job and risks having him killed, either by the fireworks or by the aliens, to go check up on the wife. I mean. what. okay, yes, she's pregnant and all but you can't leave your son like that in such a dangerous situation. and then he reaches the wife, meanwhile noone heard or saw their daughter in hours and the son is god knows where after firing the rockets. do they care? the wife is fine, the basement is sound secure, everything's okay with the world and the wife and the baby BUT WHERE ARE YOUR OTHER TWO CHILDREN. instead of rushing out TO FIND THEM, the parents TALK about having to protect them. WHAT. they are KIDS, GTFO AND FIND THEM YOU MORONIC FATHER. and then he goes and is all chill and walking slow and shit. I'd run around like a crazy mofo if my kids were in danger. and I don't even have kids. I have a dog. I would do that for my dog. nope, my dog OR my children would never even wind up in a situation like that, wouldn't allow it. you don't have to be slow, you have to be quiet. skip around, I don't give a shit, just hurry and get your fucking kids before you lose them too. idiots. so yeah now that I've covered the shitty parents part, I also want to ask, if there's someone smart enough to tell me about the fucking nail in the stair. that was sooo random, so randomly inserted into the movie to make it more dramatic but it's stupid as fuck, like, obviously the nail wasn't always there so how did it show up all of a sudden, and of course, oh so conviniently? makes. no. sense. also, when the stupid mother was dragging the bag that got caught on to the nail, she wasn't fucking smart enough to look why the bag stopped moving but instead she kept tugging on it? CMOOON. noone with even just a bit of brains would do that. if she did what any normal person would do, she never would have stepped on it. obviously. moron.  cheers.",0,0,Debilana X,WR7cc5t7tv8,-0.0936531007751938,2018-07-10 01:02:41,False,False

2018-07-11T11:26:20,"This movie is a perfect allegory for totalitarian government.  Silence becomes the safe tower. To bite one's own tongue is more precious than a bullet proof vest.  High amounts of both glee or pain register as a threat.    I find it interesting when Emily Blunt steps on the protruding nail.   It calls to mind the eastern idiom of a nail that sticks out being hammered (not drunk, that's Emily's other movie).  I know this is probably a stretch, but when Blunt is trying to keep quiet during child birth my mind goes to China's one child policy.  Silence plays powerfully as secrecy.  The fireworks conjures up images of an independence day celebration.   The boisterous and gaudy display of freedom relishes in being marvelously conspicuous.  The monsters are a stand-in for any abuse of power really.  Any oppressive situation can wedge itself into this template: domestic violence typified by a fearfully quiet wife, a powerful corporation that compels you to keep their secrets, and religious or scientific orthodoxy that will ruin you if you speak contrary to their wisdom put a chill in us.  I like the concept of a loud natural sound being a bubble of protection.  This loud natural noise seems to to be a blunt truth.  C'mon you knew it was coming.  Seriously though, the supreme leader can not kill a scientist for telling him they don't have enough enriched uranium to make a nuke.  Even a cruel dictator must bow before reality.

It isn't until society, portrayed by the film's family finds its voice that they can fight back. By standing their ground in the face of the monster or politically correct leftists that society uses a stronger sound, Trump, to bring down the beast.

It's so full of mistakes and everyone in the movie behaves like they have no brains at all, so the only enjoyment is watching them die. For example, they haven't made their house soundproofed. Instead they keep all their doors open all year around. Eventually the husband gets the clever idea of using old newspapers as soundproofing, even though the problem had been around for several years. He can build a freaking hearing aid, but didn't ever before consider that. Nothing they do makes any sense, even in small scale, like the nail they've for some reason left sticking out their stairs so that somebody can conveniently step on it. The movie is also full of contradictions in it's inner coherence, e.g. the creatures can easily hear even the smallest creaks from miles away, but they can't hear people breathing or their heartbeats even if they stand right next to them. There are tons of other similar mistakes, but I'm not going to dwell on them.",0,0,Ilari Riitakallio,WR7cc5t7tv8,0.05945378151260504,2018-12-31 04:03:20,False,False

2019-01-04T22:22:40,"LOVISH MOVIE REVIEW: This movie is okay it has somewhat at the beginning of a Bird Box feel to it till you actually see the creatures that are attacking humanity. I want to put out there that the creatures look very bad and not scary looking at all and to me, the animations on them look bad, you tell me? There is a part where a boy is about to drown in a big Cylo of corn and that had a Saw to it you tell me. Another thing people tell me do you think the creatures have a Venom from spiderman feel to it LOL? it is also sad how the father dies in this film very sad. They are making a sequel well not a sequel in 2020 where the making movie related to the first one where humanity is trying to survive from the hearing monsters. If anyone can tell me what are these creatures and where are they from? I hope that is what the second movie is about, cause it does give tiny hints on what was going on, but not where they came from or any of that. But ultimately the creature does look like the Demogorgon from Stranger Things tell me not???? Other than that I do like the actors and actresses in the movie. there is from time to time a little bit of a cliche when family members. The final verdict of A Quiet Place is a 5/10. One factor of this movie that can be better is that the monsters a different ability cause of all the ambient sound is so loud and so many ways to deter them with sounds kind of gives the element of surprise up. I kept asking my buddies what happens if there are birds and shit what happens when it rains and thunders. I hope you get it.

Why not live near the waterfall, you could do really loud farts and the aliens wouldn’t hear one of them.  Why bring a baby into a world like that, babies scream the house down half the time.   Why didn’t other aliens hear the dad running over the bridge like a heard of elephants to the little boy? The mum got her skirt stuck, she pulled and pulled, anyone would stop and look to see what it had got stuck on. If the skirt had given way while she was pulling she could have gone arse over tit down the stairs.  We have weapons that can be accurately aimed and emit high sound waves to debilitate people by bursting their eardrums. The man has had over a year to get hold of one one. They would seriously fuck the aliens’ lug holes, and the guns are silent.

2019-03-29T21:40:11,"One of my favorite movies of 2018 with Mandy being my number one favorite! My second fave horror film of 2018 after Mandy! this movie should be a wake up call to the mainstream horror genre to get out of the shitter!   The mainsteam is to take a page from the independent studios and independent horror films and foreign horror films with stuff like It Follows, Housebound, The Babadook, Tragedy Girls etc. stop remaking great horror films that don't need to be remade like Poltergeist, stop making sequels to worn out horror franchises, stop prequels etc.  independent horror films are out from the shitter known as mainstream when the mainstream should get out of the shitter, look for independent or foreign and say ""screw the mainstream"" sometimes as there is surprises like A Quiet Place to Get Out etc. and when i'm talking mainstream i mean shit like Poltergeist remake which thankfully bombed and Insidious 4 which didn't do well and dunno why Ouiji a hit, i'm glad people went to see It Follows and some people support that. Enough too much PG-13 stuff like Ouiji but A Quiet Place was excellent for a PG-13 horror film.  Remake little known films like Blood Beach or Lifeforce rather than classics like Poltergeist which thankfully bombed as it's forgotten about where the original will always be remembered but Suspiria looks nice and should be a good remake that is trying something different than be a xerox copy like Poltergeist. They need risks again, take it again mainstream just like the independents are! Paranormal Activity wasn't a risk, stop with the ghost movies, stop with the found footage movies and do something different in the mainstream horror genre. Take a page from It Follows and more. Stop being lazy mainstream horror genre, get off your fat ass and put down the potato chips or twinkies shoving and shoving them in your mouth and do something else, start trying to do something unique. Just try something different than another remake of a great movie like Poltergeist, sequel to an older franchise, found footage and all that. I don't get the hype and praise Halloween 2018 is getting! A Quiet Place was a much better 2018 horror film than that cashgrab sequel Halloween as it was something different, it took risks and became a box-office hit as i welcome it and i welcome the upcoming sequel as this is a new fresh franchise i want to embrace.  i just don't want to see these horror icons (Jason, Freddy, Chucky, Ghostface, Michael, Leatherface, Jigsaw) over and over again on the big screen and your just gonna get diminishing returns just like the Universal monsters being ran into the ground in the 30s/40s/50s as they had huge characters and big hits on their hands then pumped out sequel after another (the only great sequel is Bride of Frankenstein) and the bottom completely fell out with diminishing box-office returns and before these characters became jokes even with Abbot and Costello movies then Universal knew when to quit. If Halloween 2018 becomes a hit then studios will be like ""audiences want more Halloween, they want more Candyman, more Freddy, Jason Voorhees etc."", but for Candyman, one Candyman movie was enough as the first was excellent but the sequels were cash-ins and no more Elm Street films, Robert IS Freddy as Jackie proved it was a failure to recast Freddy for you can't do it, Robert IS the character and always was as even Englund said so.  Can't we have new horror icons already? let the worn out old tired icons like Freddy, Michael, Jason, Leatherface, Jigsaw, Ghostface, Candyman, Chucky and Pinhead die and rest in peace already, don't keep digging up them from their graves every 5 or 10 or 15 years then propping their corpses up on the big screen in Weekend at Bernies style. Just come up with with your own new horror icon and new horror franchise already! i'm not a big fan of Insidious and the Conjuring spin-offs but at least it's something different, well not quite different, but not the same old horror franchise some of us seen or the same horror icons for they are trying to create their own. I know they haven't been the best but at least they are giving a shit and giving it an effort, that's just how i feel about it.  Just try try again mainstream horror genre! making new horror icons would actually work because there are no ideas to bring in for most horror icons. New horror icons might get the hate, but it may take time before the newer ones would gain praise. I'll say this though. Even though using the same stuff is unnecessary. Just like in the last decade we got new horror icons in the mainstream like the Creeper, Captain Splauding and Jigsaw while Sam from Trick R Treat becomes a cult horror icon with Leslie Vernon when Trick and Behind the Mask were sent to the DVD direct to video market rather than to all mainstream theaters which should had happened even Hatchet was shown in midnight theaters than all theaters as there's Victor Crawley whom is a cult horror icon.  Now outside the mainstream we got Wolfcop, Tucker and Dale etc. should had been released in all theaters. I'd say end these horror franchises (Chucky/Halloween/Elm Street/Friday The 13th/Saw/Scream/Hellraiser/Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and bury them, let them rest in peace from film and let them live on through merchandise, comics, video games, toys, appreal, streams of the old movies on amazon/hulu/crackle/Netflix whatever even re-issues of the films on blu-ray and that's fair game.  Can we have new original cinematic horror icons/new franchises already? try to come up with new horror icons/franchises and try try again mainstream and let the older franchises rest in peace in favor of new franchises/new icons. This one has an excellent script, solid performances, emotion, nice creature effects and quality ideas.  This is precisely what i want in mainstream horror genre. Something different and fresh. Something different to take risks again, i want Hollywood and mainstream horror genre to take risk again and learn from this.",0,0,Johnlindsey289,WR7cc5t7tv8,0.16472147214721466,2019-03-29 21:40:11,False,False

2020-03-17T04:05:55,"First off I blame the parents and the girl and the little boy for his death. The parents know not to trust kids around something they really want and the batteries were just icing for the cake. Plus you do not put a child at the end of the line especially in a situation like that, you keep them close. Then the girl I knew when she gave the toy to the boy after the father said no, that she was hard headed would do what she wanted not thinking about no one but herself. I could not stand her because of her selfishness.. The little boy was also old enough to know what would happen if he failed to do what his dad said, but he borrowed Behavior of doing what he wanted because his sister did it. Now he is dead.. And rightly so the girl should feel guilt. But she continues to feel she can disregard what is asked of her just because she does not want to..again the selfishness will rise to hurt someone else. Some characters ruin a story for me because they think more of themselves than the rest, and that's how I felt about her. I know she adds to the story but I wish she would have been killed first. I am only about a fourth way thru the movie and had to comment on my feelings because the girl just again went against her father when he wanted her to stay behind and help her mom who was pregnant ready to have a baby. A question I had and I know A lot of you will think the same thing. Why did they get pregnant with a baby that cries and screams and makes all kinds of ungodly noises.  When they were first in the PHARMACY couldn't they have gotten some condoms to protect themselves ? That's where I see the parents selfishness come out. By bringing a baby in that world as it is , the parents are putting the rest of the family at risk.. well I need to get back to the movie The dad is away from home with his whiny son as he is trying to teach the son survival skills when the dad is no longer a round to protect and provide. And the girl who knows it all left the house and mom when dad told her not to .The girl got mad when dad told her she could not come with him and the boy. He wanted her to stay with pregnant in case she needed help. Know moms water broke so we know baby is coming and because the girl thinks what she wants to do is more important that anything else. I think someone is going to DIE again real soon..come back after movie with final comments..",0,0,Judy McGaugh,WR7cc5t7tv8,0.04678932178932178,2020-03-17 04:05:55,False,False

2020-03-17T17:50:46,"Finished watching the rest of the movie and oh course dad died protecting the girl. The kids were in an area to wait for dad to find them, but true to her nature selfish girl does not want to wait for dad to come get them and signs she is not waiting and the boy tries to tell her wait for dad, he will come for us and selfish girl says no he will come for you. As you can see she is in her pity mode. GOD ,I hate this girl, she is pure negativity all the time with her. Boys falls into grain silo and both kids go under grain , girl has jumped in to help brother. The noise attracts A  WALKING STICK THING and dad has to sacrifice  himself to save the kids. Mom is watching all this on security cameras dad put up all over their farm and she sees dads death while protecting the kids. When kids make it home they all cry for dad, and when selfish girl goes into the area of basement that dad had all his radio and camera equipment, she see all the ear amplifiers dad has been working on to make selfish girls life better and her old hearing aid better, but earlier when dad tried to give her one that he had worked on and he thought she could do better with. BUT AGAIN, the girl threw a hiss fit and refused to even look at it , dad left it with her and eventually she found dad was right and she started using it. But NEVER SAID THANKS TO DAD. AND NOW ,she is in the basement and she sees all the old hearing aids dad had tried before making the one he gave her.. she kind of had this smirky grin on her stupid face that if I had been her mom, I would have slapped her face for all the inter family problems she caused for dad. She never thanked him and she never told him she loved him .At the end baby is born, and mom kills the WALKING STICK shotgunning it in the face and on the security cameras you can see where the noise had brought 2 of those thing running towards where what's left of the family in the basement. So I have watched trailers of A QUIET PLACE 2 AND MOM AND KIDS AND BABY  TRY TO GO ON . WHY COULDN'T SELFISH GIRL HAVE DIED IN FIRST MOVIE. I would have understood and agreed with it 100%, now we have to watch her for another hour plus in New movie. I hope she has grown up and her attitude is better. In a movie where sacrifices are a must for everyone's survival, she sure doesn't get it!!!

2020-04-20T16:25:42,"This movie is just STUPID and BAD. I can´t believe this movie was received as ""the best horror movie of the year"". Seriously??? If some fans will comment this with bad words and try to defend this ""piece of junk"", well explain this, dear fans:   1. How in the hell did the military not knew that the weakness of the monsters is the ultrasound? Could they not make some kind of weapon that will help them to defeat it? 2. The monsters have the ability to recognize the sound via echo location (like bats). So in this case, according to science, they should be able to hear heart beat and breath of a human being, which makes a survival for this family very unreal. 3. The daughter used many times her hearing device against them, and only by the end she finds out that their weakness is ultra sound??? Really??? REALLY???? 4. When their father sacrificed himself, they drew away in the car, that could be heard from hunders of miles. You tell me that the monsters could not heard the car driving away??? 5. Why in hell the daughter has not used her hearing device to help her dad not to be killed by those things???   All in all, this movie IS stupid. It´s scary how many people are saying, that this movie is brilliant. Don´t you see some errors in the movie that are very logical??? Use your brain and think about what they are showing to you. This makes the movie ""Idiocracy"" looks like a doku about our society.

2020-05-03T07:02:19,"Wow.... I really tried to appreciate this film but its lack of dialogue did not help the slow pace progression, nor did they do a good job immersing me into their world.  ... in addition to all this, it was soooooo fundamentally stooooopid!!!!  A little more common sense could've saved them.  So many errors, somebody please support my ideas below haha (spoilers):  1.) Smart move sacrificing the annoying little boy immediately in the beginning.  I mean, right?  Why give the warning to the boy, and then have him be the last person out the store?  Adults should be first in - last out, and practice head counts like school field trips.  2.) Why dont they wear soft soled shoes... or at least socks?!  Barefoot slapping on the floor is sort of noisey, so it defeats the purpose right? Why was their never dirty haha...  3.) If the daughter is deaf, why is she able to whisper her sentences coherently?  4.) Why the husband didn't pull out?  5.) If the parents were concerned, why are the kids constantly roaming around freely and the parents never attentive, mainly the annoyingly at all times oblivious mother.  6.) Why did the baby not cry immediately at birth?  6.5) [additional ones I thought of]... Who left the water on that caused a flood which started to fill the basement.  6.6) How did the monster get pass the indestructible mattress to the sound proof room?  7.) Why is it when the two kids fell in the quick sand made of corn they started sinking to the bottom, escaped sinking by holding on the metal panel that conveniently fell down, but did not continue to sink in the pit when they were no longer holding that panel but instead getting crushed by it, with the monster on top???  Alsonthe girl was completely submerged... no way the little boy could've, with a single hand and a partial grip, pulled her out.  8.) Why did the mother get excited about shooting the monsters, when they were blind the whole time and she could've shot them the whole time?  9.) Why did the girl discover the weakness of the monsters but not the military.  10.) If a single shot could kill the monsters, how come the military can't do it?  11.) If all monsters immediately swarm to a loud noise how come there isn't a trap set, with speakers blasting to attract, trap and exterminate them?  12.) How come all the monsters swarmed to that gun shot at the end but not the Fire works, nor to the noises being made the whole time (like when the monster was trashing around the basment)?   This movie.... great idea, poorly written and executed.  I hate when characters are so dumb and unrealistic conviences happens just to trigger an event.  Why can't the characters just be practical, armed with common sense and average intellect, and just so happens to be always best by the threat, not due to convience but due to their natural superiority.  Don't waste your time watching this film.  Don't waste your time watching part two (I won't), especially because they left the useless mother and killed the father.  Just do what I'm going to do, and complete this series on foundflix haha.  They guy usually does a good job of summarizing everything... that is if he reviewed this one yet.
