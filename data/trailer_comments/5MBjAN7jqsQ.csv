There have been so many brilliant films from a white-guy perspective made already addressing almost exactly the same situation. We don't need fucking Jim from The office being a soldier (not a paper salesman this time, you see) because bless him, for all that he made me chuckle in The Office, thats all John is really portraying here, Jim in a combat zone.  The subject in the film is serious (don't get me wrong I'm not trivialising the subject matter) and the film takes it seriously enough, but there are *hundreds if not thousands* of BRILLIANT stories and battles across the world and history to be told, from a variety of fucking perspectives. Why are we paying to watch this, the people who made it are professional enough, wait and pressure them until they portray something that hasn't been talked about or praised before, that isn't such a safe bet with moron filmgoers. Don't pay for or give credit to something we've seen a hundred times before and ignore issues or incredible stories that deserve the light of day from across the globe.

If Michael Bay can do one thing it's shoot excellent action scenes and he totally shone in this film. I'm not even usually a fan of his work. The acting was also really good, some excellent raw emotion shown towards the end as things got worse and worse. I didn't even think the movie was very ""America ftw yay!"", it certainly didn't take a political stance one way or the other. It simply took these characters who are just doing their job to get paid and went with them, it's not their war, they're just stuck in it.  I'd recommend this film over Lone Survivor and especially recommend it over American Sniper.

2018-04-15T19:42:18,"Congressional Republicans Move From Benghazi ‚Äì Back To Obamacare    On Thursday, we watched the Benghazi hearings go from a thinly-veiled political witch hunt to a partisan dumpster fire. After this debacle that ironically made Hillary Clinton look presidential, Republicans should have learned their lesson and focused on another political issue that might not make them look like desperate partisan hacks. Then again, that would require utilizing common sense, something Republicans haven‚Äôt been all that great at for the past several years.     Speaking strictly from a strategic standpoint, if you‚Äôve just had your tail whipped on national television on an issue like Benghazi, you should try to rebuild by focusing on a political matter that you might gain back some credibility with.      That‚Äôs not what House Republicans are doing, because they never seem to learn. Now, they‚Äôre not only launching a committee to investigate Planned Parenthood, but they‚Äôre also trying to defund the organization and put a dent in Obamacare via a bill that would theoretically bypass a Senate filibuster.       Via The Associated Press:    The legislation would eliminate the health law‚Äôs requirements that most people without employer-provided health coverage buy individual policies, and that most companies provide medical insurance. It would also eliminate the statute‚Äôs tax on medical devices and another on high-priced insurance policies that doesn‚Äôt take effect until 2018.    It also prevents Planned Parenthood from getting federal money for a year ‚Äî the GOP reaction to secretly recorded tapes showing group officials describing how they sometimes provide researchers with tissue from aborted fetuses. (Source)      As a former conservative Republican, I have to ask, what in the fresh hell is wrong with these people? It‚Äôs not just Republicans in Congress; across the country, the GOP has declared war on Planned Parenthood for political points with their base. In Texas, officials raided Planned Parenthood clinics after ending their Medicaid funding.     None of this makes any sense if you‚Äôre a political party that is losing, which is why Republicans are also going back after Obamacare ‚Äì because that‚Äôs worked out so well for them in the past.     That‚Äôs right, the House has passed another piece of anti-Obamacare legislation, for the 61st time. At this point, it‚Äôs obvious that House Republicans are either out of new ideas, they‚Äôre too lazy to try something else, or they assume their base is simply too stupid to care.     The bill doesn‚Äôt stand a chance since President Obama will veto it, but that doesn‚Äôt matter to the lawmakers who passed it and the people who elected them. It may not even pass the Senate because some GOP senators do not think it goes far enough.     Three Republican senators, including presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, have said they will vote against it because it only repeals some aspects of Obamacare. Republicans cannot afford to lose any more votes in that chamber.    Republicans said it was important to force Obama to veto the bill, which contains two of their top priorities. (Source)     If you or I showed up to work when we felt like it, and then spent our time there wasting the company‚Äôs money, we would be unemployed very quickly. Sadly, that‚Äôs exactly what Republicans have been doing ever since they took control of Congress.     At the end of the day, we can be outraged about this, but they‚Äôre going to keep on doing this until we hold them accountable.

2018-04-15T19:42:58,"Latest Benghazi Hearing Proves To Be a Disaster for Republicans    While I‚Äôm sure practically every Republican in the country would disagree, today‚Äôs Benghazi hearing and the questioning of Hillary Clinton was an absolute disaster for the GOP. This wasn‚Äôt a hearing about Benghazi, this was nothing but a multimillion dollar attempted takedown of Hillary Clinton.    First, I would like to point out that almost everything asked and said during today‚Äôs proceedings has been said and asked numerous times before. While many Americans (especially conservatives) might not be aware, this is not the first investigation into Benghazi ‚Äì it‚Äôs the eighth. Most of which have been led by Republicans. In fact, this time last year, many of the same people who are on this current committee were members of another Republican-led House investigation that debunked all the nonsense that‚Äôs been pushed by the right since 2012. That‚Äôs why they released the findings of that investigation just before Thanksgiving, when most of the country was obviously preoccupied with the holiday.    I watched as much of this circus as I could and I was appalled at the disrespect many Republican members of the committee showed toward Clinton. These weren‚Äôt people looking for the truth, they were out there looking for a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù moment from the former Secretary of State.     In my opinion, the best headline summary of what today was about came from The Onion of all places:    Benghazi Committee Instructs Hillary Clinton To Limit Answers To ‚ÄòI Failed The American People‚Äô    Throughout the day, anytime Clinton would go into great detail on specifics that clearly debunked the lies Republicans have been desperately trying to convince the American people are real ‚Äì she was routinely cut off before she could complete her statement. Whenever she answered questions based on the facts ‚Äì many of the same facts from the previous seven investigations ‚Äì Republicans clearly appeared annoyed that what she was saying wasn‚Äôt confirming the lies that they‚Äôve been pushing for years.    In fact, one of the moments of the day came when Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) tried to accuse Clinton of lying about the YouTube video immediately following the attack.    ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just speak plain to the American people?‚Äù Jordan asked.   ‚ÄúI did,‚Äù Clinton responded. ‚ÄúIf you look at my statement as opposed to what I was saying to the Egyptian prime minister, I did state clearly and I said it again and in more detail the next morning. As did the president. I‚Äôm sorry that it doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative, congressman. I can only tell you what the facts were.‚Äù    It‚Äôs still baffling how much of this ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù centers around talking points. Republicans literally obsessing over what the Obama administration and Clinton said within the first 24-48 hours following the attack. Even though the president used the word ‚Äúterror‚Äù to describe the attack the next day. Not only that, but Ahmed Abu Khatallah, a suspect behind the attack, admitted that the video was used as a tool to motivate people prior to the attack.     Then there was Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL) who also showed a complete lack of respect toward Clinton. He actually went as far as to accuse her of not sending more security to Benghazi because she was trying to bask in the glow of the ‚Äúsuccess in Libya‚Äù in some sort of attempt to cover-up the unrest that was still going on there. Throughout her testimony as she tried to counter his pre-rehearsed rhetoric, he continually cut her off, often shouting over her as she tried to speak. It was clear from the start that he had an agenda to go after Clinton and that‚Äôs exactly what he tried to do.    If someone is interested in the truth, common sense dictates that they would actually care about the answer to the question they were asking. But that‚Äôs not what Republicans did. It was blatantly obvious they couldn‚Äôt care less about what Clinton actually had to say, they were simply there to grandstand.    I lost count how many times Clinton tried to answer a question only to be cutoff by the Republican who asked the question. This wasn‚Äôt about finding out facts, this was about Republicans putting together political theater. Not only were they hoping to get soundbites to use against Clinton if she becomes the Democratic nominee for president, but the GOP presidential candidates are raising money from Clinton‚Äôs testimony today.    The sheer length of this entire spectacle should be mocked as well. Questioning that began in the morning and carried on well into the evening is completely ridiculous. And as the day went on, each question became more pointless, petty, and essentially devolved into the outright badgering of Clinton.    I believe that was part of their strategy. Clearly someone who‚Äôs fatigued is much more likely to provide a ‚Äúgotcha line.‚Äù Again, that‚Äôs really what this entire show was all about ‚Äì getting soundbites to use against Clinton.    Today‚Äôs proceedings proved what an absolute sham this whole process has been. It‚Äôs been obvious almost since the start that this whole sideshow is nothing but a partisan political attack meant to try to hurt Clinton‚Äôs chances at becoming president. It‚Äôs laughable anyone would try to argue otherwise. Hell, and if you don‚Äôt believe me, just ask Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.    The bottom line is, every American should be ashamed that the deaths of four Americans have been continually exploited by the Republican party all for the sake of petty partisan politics aimed at trying to hurt Hillary Clinton‚Äôs chances next November.    I‚Äôm ashamed that this country has allowed this sideshow to go on as long as it has. I really think it‚Äôs time the question is asked: When do we investigate Republicans for wasting millions of the taxpayers dollars on what‚Äôs clearly nothing more than a partisan political witch hunt?",0,0,Libertarian Prince,5MBjAN7jqsQ,0.09744543650793643,2018-04-15 19:42:58,False,False
2018-04-15T19:43:49,"GOP in Meltdown as Second Republican Admits Benghazi Hearings are an Attack on Clinton    For most on the left, it‚Äôs not exactly breaking news that the Republican-led Benghazi investigations that have been going on for around three years now are nothing more than an attempt to take down Hillary Clinton if she ends up being the Democratic presidential nominee next November.    And what do you know, just a few months ago Republicans announced that their Benghazi findings won‚Äôt be released until 2016.    I‚Äôm shocked I tell you ‚Äì shocked!     Oh, but that‚Äôs not a big deal because Republicans claim the timing of it all has nothing to do with the presidential election. You seriously have to be willfully stupid to not see what‚Äôs going on here.    Well, all that being said, their plans seem to be crumbling every single day since House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy let the cat out of the bag a few weeks ago by admitting publicly that the main goal of the investigations was to hurt Clinton politically.    Shortly after that, a former investigator for the House Select Committee on Benghazi publicly accused Republicans of using the committee as a tool to go after Clinton. He claims he was fired for resisting pressure to focus solely on information that might damage the former Secretary of State.    Now we have another Republican, Rep. Richard Hanna (R-NY), who‚Äôs come out publicly stating that Republicans have been using the Benghazi hearings as a partisan political tool to go after Clinton.    ‚ÄúSometimes the biggest sin you can commit in D.C. is to tell the truth,‚Äù Hanna said during an interview with a radio show in upstate New York.    ‚ÄúThis may not be politically correct, but I think that there was a big part of this investigation that was designed to go after people and an individual, Hillary Clinton,‚Äù he continued.    Again, is this ‚Äúbreaking news‚Äù for most of us on the left? Of course not. It‚Äôs been blatantly obvious what these investigations have been about for years. Once they failed to use the Benghazi attack to derail President Obama‚Äôs re-election in 2012, the next obvious target was Clinton ‚Äì the person most assumed (even in 2012) would be the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination in 2016.    The question I have is, when do we start investigating Republicans for these BS Benghazi hearings which have wasted ridiculous amounts of time and taxpayer money? With McCarthy‚Äôs comments, the ex-investigator‚Äôs accusations and now another Republican admitting that taking down Clinton has clearly been the driving force for these investigations ‚Äì when do we start investigating Republicans for wasting time and millions of taxpayer dollars on partisan political witch hunts?    At this point, there‚Äôs more than enough evidence that‚Äôs been put out there to warrant an official investigation. The fact is, Republicans have wasted millions of dollars on investigations which have been nothing more than a calculated political attack against Hillary Clinton.

2018-04-15T19:44:28,"Congressman Alan Grayson Files Ethics Charge Over Benghazi Hearings    Florida Democrat Alan Grayson filed an ethics complaint Wednesday against House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., alleging they violated federal law and House rules by using official funds appropriated to the Benghazi Committee to pay political or campaign-related expenses.    ‚ÄúThis represents the new McCarthyism ‚Äî the misuse of [official] funds for political purposes to vilify a political opponent,‚Äù Grayson told CQ Roll Call. He said the House Select Committee on Benghazi, chaired by Gowdy, is an ‚Äúeffort to embarrass‚Äù Democratic presidential contender Hillary Rodham Clinton.    Grayson wants two lawmakers investigated. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) The three-page letter to the Office of Congressional Ethics, obtained by CQ Roll Call, alleges McCarthy revealed the political motivations for the Benghazi Committee in his now infamous Sept. 29 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.    ‚ÄúEverybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?‚Äù McCarthy said. ‚ÄúBut we put together a Benghazi special committee. A select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she‚Äôs untrustable. But no one would have known that any of that had happened had we not fought to make that happen.‚Äù    Though the violation may tread into some murky territory of the House Ethics Manual, Grayson believes the interview made the wrongdoing clear. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a confession that this is totally for political purposes,‚Äù he said. Grayson also called out Republicans for delaying action until the brink of 2016 primary season.    The complaint alleges Gowdy has dragged out the work of the committee for 17 months, without holding a single hearing since January, in the meantime issuing subpoenas to State Department employees and others close to the former secretary ‚Äúin an apparent effort to generate anti-Clinton information and disinformation.‚Äù    The rancor between Republicans and Democrats over the Benghazi panel has ramped up in recent days, as Clinton is set to make an appearance before the committee on Oct. 22. On Wednesday, a New York Times editorial called for shutting down the committee or renaming it ‚Äúthe Inquisition of Hillary Rodham Clinton.‚Äù     On Tuesday night, Rules ranking member Louise M. Slaughter, D-N.Y., suggested disbanding the committee.    ‚ÄúSpeaker-in-Waiting Kevin McCarthy accidentally told the truth last week and admitted that the Benghazi select committee had one mission alone: to influence a presidential election,‚Äù she said.    McCarthy, the leading candidate to replace outgoing Speaker John A. Boehner, has since walked back the comments, insisting the panel has nothing to do with politics, but the uproar has bled over into his bid for the speakership.    Grayson, currently running for a Florida Senate seat, has been plagued by his own ethics problems, including allegations he used official resources to boost his campaign.",0,0,Libertarian Prince,5MBjAN7jqsQ,0.039946164946164944,2018-04-15 19:44:28,False,False
2018-04-15T19:45:07,"House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy Admits Benghazi Hearings Were About Destroying Hillary Clinton    During an appearance on Sean Hannity‚Äôs show on Fox News yesterday evening, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (who is expected to be the next Speaker of the House) finally admitted what most of us already knew ‚Äì that the entire Benghazi investigation was designed to hurt Hillary Clinton‚Äôs poll numbers.    It was obvious from the beginning that was what Republicans were going for when they kicked off what is now the longest-running special Congressional investigation in American history, I just didn‚Äôt expect for a member of the Republican leadership to admit it on TV.    Despite the fact that the Benghazi special committee has run longer than the Watergate investigation, no evidence of any wrongdoing has been found ‚Äì but that was never the intent of the committee to begin with. Republicans were well aware that the media (especially conservative media) operates on a ‚Äúguilty until proven innocent‚Äù mindset, and just an investigation alone would be enough to fire up their base while eroding faith in the assumed 2016 Democratic nominee.      As Steve Benen points out at MaddowBlog, the whole Benghazi investigation was nothing more than a taxpayer-funded preemptive attack on a 2016 Hillary Clinton candidacy.     Note, McCarthy sees the committee as a legitimate accomplishment of the Republican Congress, not because it‚Äôs uncovered relevant details about an act of terrorism, but because Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúnumbers are dropping.‚Äù This, in his mind, is evidence of the GOP majority using its power effectively ‚Äì by using a supposedly non-partisan investigatory vehicle to embarrass a Democrat with dubious allegations.    It‚Äôs almost as if the House Majority Leader assumed he was among friends, dropped his guard momentarily, and admitted out loud what Republicans are only supposed to say in private.    There was no real reason to create this committee, and the panel itself no longer serves any legitimate purpose. McCarthy‚Äôs unexpected candor was welcome ‚Äì it was, to be sure, surprising to see him make such a concession on national television ‚Äì but it served as a timely reminder that the Benghazi investigation that no longer focuses on Benghazi is now little more than a taxpayer-financed farce. (Source)       Republicans knew all along that Hillary Clinton would run in 2016, it wasn‚Äôt any sort of secret that she would announce. In fact, it would have been a huge shock if she had decided not to run considering the massive base of support she already had in place. The GOP attack on Hillary Clinton didn‚Äôt begin with Benghazi either. They‚Äôve been after her since her husband was elected in 1992, presumably because they knew that one day she would also run for the White House.     That‚Äôs three decades of insinuating that she is a lesbian, that she and her husband had people murdered, and other assorted rumored scandals that never amounted to anything, other than the fact that Bill Clinton did cheat on her with other women. Through all of the attacks from the right, and false claims from the left, no evidence of anything criminal has ever been found ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt matter in our hyper-partisan political climate where few people bother to check facts anymore.    What Republicans didn‚Äôt count on is the surprisingly popular candidacy of Bernie Sanders, or the possibility of Joe Biden entering the race as well. However, Hillary Clinton is still very much a strong contender against anyone that Republicans would likely nominate, and the GOP is continuing to turn off independent and moderate voters with their right-wing views on social issues. With their attack on Planned Parenthood, the GOP is now driving voters to Hillary Clinton instead of away from her.    Republicans are still deathly afraid of a Hillary Clinton presidency, and considering all of the years they‚Äôve been attacking her, they very well should be.",0,0,Libertarian Prince,5MBjAN7jqsQ,0.05285493827160494,2018-04-15 19:45:07,False,False
