Aster said this is going to be a psychological thriller, not horror, but with Aster you never know. Also the exhale sound in the trailer could hint at a drug like Devils Breath being blown in unknowing victim's face's not knowing exactly what it is. If you know what Devils Breath is this could be very disturbing. Scopolamine is what it is and makes its victims do whatever you want them to do and like doing what you tell them.

2019-04-10T16:17:54,"I find the rune stone in the trailer extremely intriguing and interesting to me. I highly believe the runes are not chosen by random. The top rune is Algiz upside down, which could be understood as the rune of death. Note that death is only one of the many meanings, but it makes sense when we pay attention to the other runes. The middle rune is Reido. It can mean travelling and advancing in physical and/or spiritual way. Besides that, when speaking of shamanism and witchcraft it can stand for ritual. The last rune at the bottom is Perthro. It is a very mysterious and dark rune, and it can mean things like burial, grave, cave or a place under the earth. One can see it also as a rune of the other world. So, all in all, I think that the stone in the trailer could mean something like ""doing a death ritual to reach the underworld"". As I said before, these runes cannot be chosen randomly. There are deeper meanings in them and this makes me anxiously wait for the movie, as I feel we are dealing with something totally else than the basic horror movies seen nowadays.",2,1,TheTrueMantis,I0UWIya-O0s,-0.034045893719806763,2019-04-10 16:17:54,True,True
