Would have been so much more pure, so much more transcendent if Tyler was able to help Zak without involvement from a beautiful character. The notion cheapens the friendship and distracts from the story, making it seem to the audience that such platitudes are necessary for us to be able to connect with the characters. And here, we can only venture so far involving an unorthodox friendship that the filmmakers essentially tell us that such altruism is fundamentally rewarded?   We can't just transcend for the sake of human-to-human sacredness? We have to be led to believe that there's some type of ""atta boy"" pat on the back in the form of a beautiful family member who will see Tyler's act of selflessness and thus reward him with her romantic involvement?

2020-04-21T09:14:30,I‚Äôm glad I watched this movie and also just generally happy for Shia finding his way in acting. I always thought of Shia as an amazing actor but his personal life kept getting in the way of fully getting recognized for his acting skills as well as dropping the Disney child actor tag as he fit the stereotype of being a trouble ex-child actor but 2019 was a really good year for Shia with this and Honey Boy. I just hope he can maintain this positive wave and get back into being given good opportunities as he seems to have figured himself out as a man and actor. Would love to see him in a big movie that gets him Academy recognition because he really deserves it.,0,0,Shaun Bang,UNl9RqjLCwc,0.2951515151515151,2020-04-21 09:14:30,False,False

Shia with his very well known issues but for Dakota as Shia had the franchise child actor label from Transformers, I really do think that her decision to do the Shades of Grey franchise put a negative light on her actual abilities. Hopefully people will stop thinking of Transformers and Fifty Shades when they think of both these actors as they‚Äôve done so much more and better work just like this film and Honey Boy for Shia. Heck I even thought Shia was amazing in Fury but because of the public and personal issues he had going on at that time people brushed it off and forgot about his performance in that film",0,0,Shaun Bang,UNl9RqjLCwc,0.223202614379085,2020-04-21 09:17:28,False,False

2020-05-03T04:21:00,"I think Shia LaBeouf wants so desperately to be real... he's getting there, I'm proud to say.  Real doesn't just recognize real - real recognizes everything.  He doesn't want to be another actor.  He wants to seize the fucking day while it may be had.  He takes his characters and cannibalizes them - ingesting their souls and emblazoning them with technicolor.  His angst about his father is key to his brilliance... unfortunately.  It's a double-edged sword.  I love Shia because he stands out - he is boiling with such immense potential.  For awhile I thought he might break - perhaps he did.  But - as I had hoped - he is an overcomer.  ...and the things he had to overcome are not trivial.  When I observe Shia, I observe an everyman - perhaps an Ubermensch.    As someone who had to deal with abandonment issues, I ""feel"" Shia... I would like to hang out with him and talk about it, as we freaks have precious few who can kind of understand.  I know - that people with childhood trauma do not really have that many people to talk to - not really... so we internalize.  But in doing that, we skirt the fringes of sanity... and we few who actually make it... who actually learn how to view other people as ... well... real people, usually end up being the most interesting people on Earth.  That void is continually filled with things we are interested in - and in the end... there's nothing we're not interested in.  Shia is going to do what he wants.  He will find an unexpected success - and it will just get better and better as he learns to crawl out of the crucible of suffering that he has been accustomed to.  I do not follow actors, or anyone, really - but Shia seems to be a kindred spirit.. His energy resonates with my own - and that, to me, is compelling.",0,0,hybridamerica,UNl9RqjLCwc,0.16710526315789473,2020-05-03 04:21:00,False,False
