Do you know that he increases in size as well, becoming giant man? Do you know that his character is very complex and has gone through many controversial changes? Do you even know anything about the character? If the answer to all these questions is no, then you shouldn't judge the character so strongly before seeing him. If the answer is yes, then I can understand why you are not inclined to like the character. As for the movie itself, I shall only sincerely judge it after it comes out, and I hope you do the same.

No standard or appreciation for the art-forms it seems all they have to be is ""cool"" and geeky enough.  I rant a lot about this but I feel like DC is trying to do the same thing. Instead of pushing for a more serious approach like the NOlan films, they're going for mindless action and zero depth. Just pumping out films like they're products...

But if they can make this cool and fun and up-to-snuff, and it certainly looks like they can, I say, so what? Take Ant Man and make a awesome, funny movie if you know you can, because even if it doesn't contribute a whole lot to the wider shared universe (though no-one expected Iron Man to hint at SHIELD and the Avengers when it did, so who knows), if it's good and fun, we'll all be better of for it.   I actually kind of hope they don't try and shove in universe-building just to get it in there and make Ant Man seem relevant to the rest of the MCU. That shoving in of the universe really kinda brought down Iron Man 2 and Guardians, to an extent (moreso to an extent with Guardians, because we do need to see a bit of Thanos before Infinity Wars, but he also really kind of subsumed Ronan as the big bad, which he technically could do, but making the main villain of the film rather subservient to a mostly off-screen villain rarely works well).  Ant Man, I think, could easily have the same problem of them trying to cram in universe-building stuff to sort of justify the existence of the movie, however briefly-seen yet overshadowing said crammed stuff is, and that would be a shame. It would be a shame because this looks like it could be something on the scale of Iron Man 1; something with the truly perfect blend of seriousness and silliness, that strikes that perfect tone and story for a true, unabashed, unashamed super hero film. Guardians and Winter Soldier came damn close to that ideal, but those were as much space opera and spy flick as they were superhero films, dragged down ever so slightly by the conventions of their subgenres. The Thors and the other Iron Men were alright, but they were less tight and more burdened, carrying the weight of establishment and continuation while at times forgetting some key aspects (every portrayal of Iron Man since 1 has forgotten he grew out of his irreverent, doesn't-think-long-term shithead phase (mostly) halfway through the first movie, while Odin in Dark World seemed much less diplomatic and reasonable and Odin-like, for lack of a better term, purely so Thor could be in the right on what to do about who to love and fight and how). Iron Man 1 was pure, perfect super hero greatness on scale we never comprehended before, and we haven't truly had a solo Marvel film live up to that standard since. It's come close, inarguably, but it's also always stopped just short. We could get that again here, I feel like.",0,0,ISchulz,pWdKf3MneyI,0.2293985307621671,2015-04-14 07:35:49,True,True

I'm kinda surprised that despite the great humor (which let's be real here people, isn't the script itself but just what's probably left over from the Edgar Right days, which Marvel, I'm still angry at you for), it still looks really bland. It's like all the issues of the MCU have been distilled down into one film. Uninteresting human characters, bland and rehashed plots, and for a franchise about a connected universe, there is a total lack of consequences. Hopefully Phase 3 changes these issues, but for now, even GotG felt like the same plot as EVERY OTHER MOVIE IN THIS FRANCHISE, just in a more fun coating.

It's not being different to change your story that was originally deep and complex and boiling it down and cutting the fat until it fits into a jar, it's being lazy because you left out the one character in the new avengers film that is the sole catalyst for the new films entire being (the ultrons).",0,4,Yourwolfsdengaming,pWdKf3MneyI,-0.0470942417370989,2015-04-15 03:11:18,True,True

Adaptation for movies ALWAYS leaves so much to be desired...the expense of making a movie. You would think that by now, they could just automate the creation of CGI, like ordering a pizza from a smart-machine with a bottomless database, but no.      A weekly TV show always does better at making a comic more to life, even more to science. In a movie you HAVE to go for broad strokes...letting women punch men, which in real life, would get her GUTTED! Stuff like that.    I really feel, that web-based movies, are the best of both worlds, TV-like regular presentation but the costs are, or can be, FAR lower...better CGI, why? TV's do NOT have plug-ins, software plug-ins! On the web, SHOWS-ABOUT-THE-SHOWS and advertising revenue opportunities so good that rich-content-advertising could actually have...DRUM ROLL PLEASE...their own channel/movie!    Movies?

Old Daredevil was Fox (Marvel got back recently and made a great show in Netflix about his early career).  DC is in late, it's a fact, they are too much on Nolan/Snyder Logic, it's not a bad thing but they overusing it (just look how much Arrow is kinda similar to Nolan's Batmans).  Marvel stroke earlier and their MCU is done very carefully, of course, they aren't prefect but Avengers was a immense bet and success, so was Guardians of the galaxy. I think Ant-man will surprise many. Of course this  won't be a success as big as Avengers 2 but this one has its charm.   The strengh of Marvel is to be able to do very gritty and dark show like Daredevil (again i'm speaking about the serial on Netflix not the old movie), and things lighter llike Ant-man.

2015-04-26T15:30:11,"You'd think many would fear this movie being Marvel Studio's first true failure (Hulk didn't fail it just didn't do well, similar to Thor: The Dark World), given the source material. But honestly, after watching Daredevil, Guardians of The Galaxy, Agent Carter, Winter Soldier, Iron Man 3, Thor, etc it's clear that Marvel can pull off any genre. The superhero genre doesn't exist. It's superheroes in different genres. The Iron Man Trilogy are tech thrillers, Hulk was a monster fighting movie akin to Godzilla, Captain America and Agent Carter were period pieces, Guardians of The Galaxy was a Sci-Fi Adventure, Thor was a fantasy, Avengers (and AOU) is a straight out action thriller, Ant-Man is said to be a heist movie, Daredevil is a drama, Winter Soldier was a spy movie, Doctor Strange is said to be a horror movie, and even then we'll still have other movies: Civil War, Ragnarok, Inhumans, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Spectacular Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and Infinity War Parts 1 & 2. As well as other TV shows: AKA Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Agents of SHIELD season 3, Agent Carter season 2, Daredevil season 2, etc. Yea, I don't think Marvel Studios is going to fall anytime soon.

There would also be no real need to say he has super human strength as an Ant sized person would still be able to lift the same, so if someone were to step on him, not only would it NOT squish him (stepping on a person's chest to kill an ant is barely going to hurt a person), he could then pretty much toss the guy over.  To be further realistic though, leverage plays a big role when trying to flip someone over, and an ant sized person would have no leverage, so it would be harder.

2015-07-08T09:38:34,"For those that struggle to convince their friends that Ant-Man's abilities are at-all interesting, or those who themselves find the powers silly or pointless, whether discussing the original Hank Pym or the Pym-taught Scott Lang, consider the following:  1. Need armor? Patch together 100+ layers of shrunken Kevlar (or any combination of materials you can imagine) and you are at the very least durable, potentially indestructible.  2. Need energy? Shrink a building-sized power plant with matching fuel supply to fit in the palm of your hand. An array of 10,000+ of Stark's arc reactors anyone?  3. Need computing power? Shrink a full super computer complex and you have a souped up iPhone. Combine and arrange any number of shrunken components of your choice or design and the possibilities grow tremendously. Can you imagine how many miniaturized components the Ant-Man helmet alone could contain? The helmet can do much more than help communicate with ants.  4. Pym is creative and intelligent. He discovered the Pym particles he uses for re-sizing and invented ways to isolate and harness them. There is a reason why it was Pym that created Ultron in the comics as opposed to Tony Stark, Bruce Banner or even Reed Richards. Stark is the scientist heroes go to for upgrades; Pym is the scientist Stark goes to for upgrades. Any idea you can come up with, he could take it to the next level.  Remember, the Ant-man suit is simply a subset of the generalizable and flexible Pym technology; Micro-sized super-villain prisons, Ultron and indirectly The Vision are some of the other most notable applications from the comics. I won't even expand on the growth/Giant-Man aspect of the character or the interactions with Wasp.   With this perspective, it is easy to see why Ant-man is not only a worthy member of the Avengers, but a defining member. Do those adamantium/vibranium wielding warriors like Wolverine or Captain America look so much cooler than Ant-man anymore? (They're still cool, and yes, they have other characteristics that make them interesting and relevant.)

2015-07-17T00:33:54,"Ant-Man is not a comic that I am very familiar with, and I can already tell that it is being handled pretty strangely and arguably poorly, given the choice to use Lang over Pym, and Pym's age, and the removal of Pym's affiliation with Ultron, the production history thus far and probably a few more things still that more die hard fans could point out. But it still looks like a good time. Not a far cry from Guardians of the Galaxy. I never would have thought I'd be a fan of a talking raccoon before that one. This still looks like a comic book adaptation and I appreciate that it isn't trying to take itself too seriously like DC's current projects with 80% of it's cast looking not even a little bit like their comic book counterparts.  Personally, I would have gone with Michael Rosenbaum for Scott Lang. He seems closer to the images that I find of Scott Lang in the comics, and from his time voicing the Flash on the Justice League Animated Series, I know he has that same type of humor that you see Paul Rudd going for in these trailers. But I do like Paul Rudd too, I just about died laughing at the ""Role Models"" movie that he is in.  That said, unlike BvS or Suicide Squad or Fantastic Four, I will definitely be going to see this. The fact that the casting for this film clearly wasn't driven by politically correct pandering is both very refreshing and something that I can wholeheartedly support. Nothing makes me face palm harder than watching Hollywood cast one or two cast members like they are going for visual accuracy, just to abandon that practice entirely for the rest of the cast so that they can pander to people who will only come see the movie if there is black/brown/lgbt/feminist/etc representation in it.  Maybe this film will be a hit, maybe it will be a flop. All I know is it appeals to me far more than the shit casting that DC's projects have.  Hopefully they find some clever way to tie Ant-Man/Scott Lang in to the broader Marvel Universe since the whole Pym-Ultron bridge has been burned. I love the little tie in stuff, like the Avengers article in the news paper in the Daredevil Netflix series. Hopefully this does not land on the Iron Man 3 side of the MCU spectrum.",0,0,Absconditus Veritas,pWdKf3MneyI,0.10083333333333333,2015-07-17 00:33:54,False,True

Also the Father - Daughter conflict subplot is unconvincing, and kinda unnecessary - Some jokes, especially the end where they try to set Ant man up to join the Avengers fell flat, and somewhat confusing. - Underdeveloped characters.

Not a whole lot of science on how his powers work.   They tried to explain it in the film, but there were too many scenes that took place that contradicted how exactly he keeps his mass. For example, when he shrinks for the first time and he falls onto the bathroom tile, it breaks. Or when he lands on the car, it leaves a tiny dent. But in a different scene (1:25 to be exact) we see him running down the barrel of a gun. If he keeps his mass, the person holding the gun would not be able to support that weight. Also during the finally where Hank Pym's keychain tank is revealed to be real, how the hell would Hank have been carrying this tank in his pocket?
