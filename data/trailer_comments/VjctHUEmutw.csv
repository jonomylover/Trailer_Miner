I think it's kinda dull with Denzel wearing the same shirt throughout the whole movie. I would've liked to see him wearing a black trench coat and a fedora or a black leather jacket and turtle neck or a black suit with a tie to make him look more mysterious! I also think Chloe's character could be used for so much more than just the typical damsel-in-distress, she could definitely be of some use to Denzel's character. Lastly, I would feel a lot more confident about this film if it had a different director and screenwriter behind the project, although I have nothing against Antoine Fuqua but I feel that Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Trilogy/Captain Phillips), Tony Gilroy (The Bourne Legacy/Michael Clayton), Brian Helgund, Martin Campbell, Christopher Nolan, Michael Mann, Ridley Scott, The Coen Brothers, or Sam Mendes (007: SkyFall) should've been the director.

F.I.: - There isn't any action during almost the first half of the movie. - The girl in the trailer is only seen 10 minutes at the start of the movie and 5 minutes in the end of the movie; you barely hear anything about the girl during the movie at all. He basically just felt bad for the girl for a brief moment, but for almost the other 90% of the movie it's about Denzel who becomes the victim instead of the girl, and he only has to protect himself.(probably that's why you almost don't see the girl during the movie at all.) - There isn't THAT much action in the movie; but for the duration there is, it's good action. - The ending is very, VERY chippy.  Keep in mind that's just my opinion. I still would rate it high, but I can't recognize the trailer in the movie.
