This will become one of Britain's biggest most successful films ever. Mark my words. An instant classic, perfect for Christmas and as feel good as it can get. One critic said it was Jason Bourne in a duffel coat and he's not wrong! There had never been a movie where I have wanted to shout from the rooftops, until now! Hugh Grant camping it up - all the way to 11. He's in on the joke though and happily plays a parody of himself with wonderful abandonment giving some of the best comedy moments. Some of the best actors that Britain has to offer are on fine form, but all have a moment to shine. London has never looked so chocolate box with steam trains and working telephone boxes. The kind of perfect dream right up there on screen. So now I'll say this. Stay to the end. The very end - for a visual treat you will never forget! Go see it with the kids, with your partner, your granny and your pets. Any excuse will fill you once again with total and utter joy. British at its best. Well what are you waiting for??! Go! Go!
