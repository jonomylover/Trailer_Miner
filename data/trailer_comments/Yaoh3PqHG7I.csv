Once the Purge is over he goes back to his family to see they are alive and well, the anxiety and anguish he has exalted takes the best of him and he slaughters the ones he loved.  Looking over, he experiences major acts of emotions taking in on what he did to his family. Running away from his property he goes to find a broken masks of one of the group who took a participation in the event in midst of a fire. He holds it in his hand reasoning with himself.

Considering that people can kill anybody EXCEPT high government officials during the purge, don't you think that's IRONY of ""ANARCHISM?"" Tons of civilians are killed while high ranking officials sit in the comfort of their homes. I can't imagine anarchists participating in such activity by the government. Realistically, 12 hours is enough for people who hate the gov or the purge to bring down the gov or ROB A FREAKING BANK. :P    All systems are down. You have 364 days to plan.

2014-07-09T07:26:25,"I don't understand why they make sequels to crappy movies. The Purge was the dumbest movie, I think Ethan Hawk's acting has peeked at Assault on Precinct 13. He could have shown way more emotion then he did. For the entire time of the movie, the ""homeless guy"" wore dog tags, and could fire a weapon. Yet, the entire movie, no one bothers to mention or notice his dog tags or think to ask him that. It would have been cooler, to have Hawk, talk to the guy, and find out he was in war, otherwise, why bother showing clearly visible military dog tags if no back story is coming from it. The decision to help him, should have come from Ethan Hawk's background character information, where he served in the military before the Purge started. That would have made an awesome movie moment where instead of pointing the gun at him, he hands the guy the gun, but no, we don't even get a clear definition of that. I wasn't even sad what happened to the outcome of the Ethan's character at the end. Once I noticed the obvious foreshadowing of the neighbor acting like she was jealous, I knew it was going to be the neighbor's attacking them.  It was a great concept, but to Hell with the budget. I've seen fan fiction videos on youtube with less of a budget that are way more amazing, with just 100 dollars and a decent affects studio. I would have liked to have the son from the first, be the main protagonist for this movie. It would have been cooler, to see what happened outside more. The ""security footage"" was poorly shot, and just basically repeating the same mundane type murders. It wasn't even a good ""Thriller"" movie, I scare easy, I wont deny I do. I laughed the whole movie, and nearly fell asleep in most parts. Such a disappointing movie, studios must be really desperate for franchise movies, I'd much rather have a sequel made from a good movie then a bad one. This one, I hope someone spoils the ending for me, so I can save 10 bucks for the theater. And Budget, is not an excuse for being lazy, with making a movie. ",0,0,Eternaldarkness3166,Yaoh3PqHG7I,0.12958333333333333,2014-07-09 07:26:25,True,True

At first the violence wouldn't have been much but as people grow older it becomes more common. If someone you know was murdered and you know who did it, you could get them back. It creates a chain of violence every year. Normally people wouldn't commit murder because there are laws, but if you have law saying murder is okay once each year, as more and more people die, and more generations past the violence gets worse.

It also means lynch mobs. Rules and laws are built into human nature.  Just think about it for two seconds. If you had a year to prepare for this what would you do.

2014-09-03T08:22:47,"  I love reading fan fiction, where people add or change things in their favorite movie stories. I would love to see The Purge mixed in with other movie ideas, Purge Fan Fiction Crossovers. The first one I'd like to see is one dealing with The Expendables, where they are caught in the wake of a new experimental weapon, and are transported from Earth Prime to the world of The Purge. There, they have to survive, and defend as many innocents as they can, before they can find their way back to Earth Prime. The second idea would deal with Batman, where he is hit by an experimental weapon, but instead of dying he is transported to the world of The Purge, where he must defend the innocent, and discovers that the Bruce Wayne of Purge Earth is evil, and becomes Batman only for the night of The Purge, where he hunts the poor using his gadgets and fighting prowess, and the Bruce Wayne/Batman of Earth Prime must fight and stop him, Bruce Wayne must battle Bruce Wayne! The third idea would deal with Black Widow and Hawkeye, where they accidentally trigger a new Hydra device, and are transported to Purge Earth, where they discover that Hydra agents are there testing new weapons on people, all under the guise of being people who are Purging. The Black Widow and Hawkeye must stop them, and survive the other hunter teams out to kill them! The fourth idea would deal with Daredevil and The Punisher, where they are transported to Purge Earth, and must discover how they got there, and survive long enough to find their way home! And finally, I would like to see the crew of The Serenity, transported back to Earth That Was, and must find the parts to fix their crashed ship, and survive the night against hunter teams.

But on the contrary... many of those that didn't manage to get the revenge in those 12 hours, would stop at nothing to try to kill the bastards whenever they can... Which would cause a civil war if this revenge thing is spread in a bigger scale.  Also, considering that there are still quite a lot of people that will be against this purge thing regardless if its legal or not to murder people. Its more than expected that a rebellion (or something close to it) will arise to stop it for good. And well, its quite the bs that nothing like it has happened yet.

This mask might be euphemistically described as their day job.....crime fighters by day and torturers by night.....behaviors so disturbing that the average reader might begin to consider revolution as the only way left to reclaim America from its insidiously entwined new world order which is conducting in secret a silent holocaust which decides who in society has purpose and can remain verses who is useless and cannot.

This mask might be euphemistically described as their day job...crime fighters by day and torturers by night......behaviors so disturbing that the average reader might begin to consider revolution as the only way left to reclaim America from it's insidiously entwined new world order which is conducting in secret a silent holocaust which decides who within society has purpose and can remain verses who is useless and can not. Think this is impossible in America today? Think again! The recent violence in Baltimore occurred after an obvious travesty of justice, but unknown to most people there exist thousands of regular citizens just like you and I whose number resides between 300,000 and 500,000 Americans who are being slowly and silently tortured, stalked and murdered by our nation's secret police who use directed energy weapons to commit their crimes under the radar with no news media involved. These vile criminals from within the nexus of law enforcement and the military industrial complex use well honed counterintelligence tactics, electronic harassment, and remote neural monitoring in order to monitor and reshape society according to their twisted ideology and represent the vanguard of the so called fourth branch who will with enough time and if left unchecked enslave our great nation in the near future, Wake up America!!

Oh wait, because the movie wouldn't be interesting otherwise, well here's my personal opinion...It's NOT interesting even when they STAY. I'm sorry to say this next for anyone who enjoys these movies but mostly to those who actually believe this would happen in four or three years (since they mentioned it this type of thing happening in 2000 and something). This would never and I mean NEVER happen, and if it did than there would probably be world war 3. People would soon start go against it, go rebellion and start a revolution. Not to mention how exactly does Purge even work? All they ever say is ""It just works."" HOW? I believe they themselves don't know the reason. Another reason why it would' work is this, there's a HIGH chance that people with anger issues or mental illness will only get even more aggressive, after more and more killing or physically hurting others they'll crave more and more and soon would start doing these things whether there's a Purge or not. Not to mention LOTS of people would be moving away from America since on that one goddamn day they cannot trust anyone, their families, friends, lovers just ANYONE without worrying they might kill them. It's already 2017 pretty close to the year when the purge began and thank the GOD no one is suggesting such STUPID idea in America!",1,0,Bloody Luna,Yaoh3PqHG7I,0.06656666666666666,2017-11-04 22:52:32,False,False
