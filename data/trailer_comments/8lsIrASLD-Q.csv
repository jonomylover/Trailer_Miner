With the dinosaurs extinct, the lack of large predators allowed the mammals to gain a foothold on the new predator-less world.

2015-06-02T21:39:15,"Although I will say that this movie looks very original and incredibly ambitious there were a few thoughts that flew through my mind while viewing this teaser. One of which is if dinosaurs weren't extinct, humans would cease to exist. I'm only saying this since the plot revolves around a human boy and his diplodocus companion-I think that was a diplodocus. Anyway, ever since dinosaurs went extinct, mammals were able to occupy the niche in natural selection since they were able to dig burrows during the impact. That's why creatures such as wholly mammoths, giant sloths, and neanderthals existed. If the extinction never occurred, mammals would've still hide in their burrows and natural selection would join with the more successful species which were the dinosaurs.  Despite that, I'm still going to pay $15 to see this movie in 3D  ",0,0,Francisco Florez,8lsIrASLD-Q,0.14583333333333334,2015-06-02 21:39:15,True,True

Sorry, I want to get excited for this new pixar movie (I know I am about inside out), but as a dinosaur fan, looking at this video, there are so many cringe worthy moments that it makes suspension of disbelief difficult, even for a cartoon.   Other people have pointed out the somewhat odd look of cartoons against realistic backgrounds, but it's more than that: The thick asteroid belt, poorly done (or just hyper-stylized?) earth, the lighting up of the asteroid from far above the atmosphere, the naked pterosaurs and theropods (though apparently there will be some feathered velociraptors, to give them some credit), the dinosaurs shown watching the flyby being long extinct at the time...¬†   Ignoring facts, I personally still don't like how the dinosaurs look: They lack detail, and remind me too much of old, archaic paintings from a hundred years ago: Tyrannosaurs with their heads held at weird angles, sauropods with pot-bellies and spaghetti necks. and so forth...    Pixar often says how they do lots of research for their movies: scuba diving for finding nemo, going to south america for up... here it seemed there was very little effort given. Or it's just more cartoony than any pixar movie before it. *shrug*    But those are just my initial thoughts... hopefully I'm being overly critical about a subject matter I care about, and it will be an enjoyable movie non the less.",1,0,StefanPWinc,8lsIrASLD-Q,-0.003355823863636369,2015-06-03 19:37:04,True,True

They would put them in a parallel universe in which the earth wasn't hit by the asteroid, and all the dinosaurs are still living. This is one reason why the Dinosaurs look so animated and unreal, because they have evolved (for whatever reason) to look like that. Back to the future humans, they would just study what the prehistoric people did.  These future humans might be trying to figure out their past, how they became so smart, etc., and also put down obstacles in the prehistoric people's way, not only to study them, but also introduce further plot into the movie.
