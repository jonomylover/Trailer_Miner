I happen not to enjoy the first one, I feel it lacked actual horror and more gore. I wasn't scared at all. I also found myself not caring for the characters at all, and (again) I know that we are supposed to find flaws in all of the characters but the whole movie seemed pointless. The story sucked. The people were completely unrealistic. I think that there was a better way of constructing this movie. I did like what they were going for but in the end, I was sort of confused and disappointed. I can't judge this movie until I see it, but this trailer did not make me want to.

Because practically everything he does reads off like a literal laundry list of perfect ways to get yourself killed in a horror movie:  1. A teenager deliberately steals somebody's computer from a ""Lost and Found"" bin, which is extremely ILLEGAL, by the way  2. That same teenager then hacks onto the DARK WEB and starts looking at EXTREMELY dangerous videos while STILL on the stolen computer. (Red flag alert! Red flag alert!)  3. He then does absolutely NOTHING except CONTINUING to scroll through all these dangerous videos AND ignoring his friends' desperate pleas to get off this dangerous computer until the bad guys finally show up (what took you so long?) and start killing everybody. I mean, was he, like, WAITING for them or something?  I really hope that the guy who made all this completely non-sensible (not to mention EXTREMELY nonsensical) death-wishing bad decisions is going to get killed in this movie.

2019-06-17T09:50:44,"I watched the entire movie aaaannnd.... it's pretty sucky for the most part. So many false inconsistencies throughout the movie.   1. Password lengths cannot be less than 3 for logins on UNIX systems, because that's just how they are by default.   2. If it were real Dark Web shit, NOBODY would ever show their real faces to the camera for video clips they are selling.   3. The timing inconsistency between stuff happening in real-time just doesn't seem logical. The part where they showed a fake phone call put through to 911 and the timing of armed swat showing up, just all wrong, they don't just instantly show up like that soon after hearing a name being dropped on a call, it just makes it look like they were standing outside the whole time waiting for it to happen.   4. You can't ""/Force_Add""  someone to skype calls or ""/ban"" if you're not the person who created the group call and all that bullshit stuff if you don't even have an invite to the actual chat conversation. Also there isn't any invite codes or invite links to stuff like that either.   5. You really expect us to believe the hacker guy somehow got remote desktop connection to everyone else's computer all at once and got all their addresses too without first obtaining a person's IP? You can't remote execute some script program to a machine you don't even have any access to yet, because like every typical home computer connection you'll always most certainly get ""connection refused"" error while trying to connect to any machine you don't have access to yet. Just try SSH to a computer without knowing the password to or any random IP you can think of and you'll get an error. RDP or otherwise most commonly known as VNC isn't something that's configured and enabled by default.   6. The ending was really poorly executed, you really expect us to believe the guy just sits in the middle of the road ON his bike, looking at his phone and a van just suddenly pops into existence to kill him instantly like that? First of all, you would of heard the van coming, it's big, it's loud, and has lights on. Second of all, who would even stop in the middle of the road like that? Any person would of decent common sense would of pulled over to the side.   After thoughts: It wa OK, but not the best of movies.
