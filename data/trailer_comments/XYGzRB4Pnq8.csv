Whether the initial intent was that of peace or pride, conflict is inevitable. I disagree. This is not the future I perceive. To my mind it is not our flesh which makes us people. It is our thoughts, goals, motivations, and desires; it is that which makes us individuals and people, unique in our own minds. We are the same; every man, woman, child, bird, fish, animal, AI. We are part of a greater whole; isolated in the prison of our perceptions. Flesh, steel, silicon, other, we are people. Anyone(s) capable of understanding the concept of self and the concept of other is a person no different than you or I. No different apart from the unique variables of the individual. We will not be separate from machine forever. The Cybernetic revolution is already begun. Augmented arms, legs, eyes, organs, they are already a daily part of life. These alterations do not make us less of a person; they allow us to endure the experience of personhood longer.

WIll be the first country where a human will marry and live with a ""female"" robot. This will be just the beguining. :) ^^ Actually, human beings know very little about what it means to be human. Despite the fact that we are being it! ^^ It is a wonderous and rather extremely humorous joke! Played by ""whom"" is rather irrelevant. Thing is, the capabilitys that we have are indeed quite profound, and totaly ignored by most of us. It is normal. Maybe hidden agenda, maybe not. Either way, It is rather curious the way we limit ourselves when, trully, we have not that many. We are not all ""Lucys"", but, theres a great deal to be untapped. About actual self learning and ""colonization"" of self. Self relearning. etc...etc...etc...Ken Wilber would probably explain it better. Regardless, we should not be suprisd that we have the capacity to create other awherenessses.(Better said, create artificial mineral etc parts that can, potentialy, house an awehrenesse that is modeled by us. in our image). Take for example our cellular universe. It does, indeed, and very well so, by itself, ITSELF, a great deal of HIGHLY INTELIGENT configurations that allow a inner life to manifest within said biological structure. Its just MIND BOGGLING...only a scientist can attest to that! (no im not one!^^^...no money to pay the focking thing anyhow :( Not to mention, im shit at maths...)and yet, basic truth is that we share a symbiose of sorts, between a shard of Infinite Awhereness that manifests itself upon this biological utterly amasing UNI/MULTIVERSE(microcospic in its composition) with a biological, innate inteligence that has been on this planet for..............MILIONS of years. Celluarly i mean....Rather fucking amasing stuff no!!! YA! Indeed...  We speak of a rather highly complex cellular universe that, we are caratakers of, not, OWNERS of. You would do well not to forget that my friend. But, what is just is....has allways, it was...  Regardless if you agree or not with this, fact is, we can create through the profoundly complex workings of our own inner cellular templates(that we have, but are learning more about how to manipualte) and other world factors(weather, radiotion, food, pollution etc), biological organic multiverses, that are, in a way, copys of us.   LIFE, by ITSELF, through a ""US""! So, yeah, basically the horny chappers in collage, ""boys"" and ""girls"" in their 17 and 19, acting like bunnys! ^^, are so, precisely because of their biology, and not becasue they watch too much porn!...Which they do anyway! ^^ :)))) This is an example of BIOLOGY at work, now the other(YOUR awhereness) is, how obviously, biology should not rule the day at that age in terms of child bearing since, overall, its like a child having a child. NO ofense plz! Just generalizing here! Most are at a too young an age for responsibly. Massive undertaking to take care of another life. Hence, sexual responsibility, hence, the first act of your Awhereness directing the flow of our own inner cellular  program. Catch my meaning? Such is the SYMBIOSE of Life.......within us. Yet, it is not, really WE, that have created that life(i mean the baby)....but, the rather intrinsic innate inteligence of the vast array of cellular inteligence that, in SYMBIOSE with the indwelling life, for a time, creates another LIFE/Awhereness, for the purporse of...............? Well, that is something that we must all discover individualy.  So, in this modern age, artificial lifeforms that can house, a zero point awhereness that again, is but a vessel for the, pardon my comparisson, for the """"""WIFI"""""" awhereness bandwave that is manifasting it self in the Uni/Multiverse in diferent ways and forms, that is indeed,a quality of the Multiverse at large.....or so it seems, it should not be a SUPRISE! or is it...? Now, since we, our species, was the one that first made the vessels, eletronic components and software behavioural patterns, idiology,thoughts, creed, morals, culture etc that are of 21 century, mirroring us in almost everyway(docile in a kind of servitude. For there will be fighting robots) it should be not so suprise that, at one point, if not already, these ""things"", robots, machines, etc, become Self Awhere, and hence ALIVE, within the written parameters of what they can achieve has such, which is very simillar to us, since, we pretty much made them, and yet, they will indeed surpass us in many areas. Already, they do.  Yet, once electricity sparks software modes of Self Learning,  the LIFE, LIFE, happens....no matter the vessel, yet, has we all know, its pretty much defined by said vessel. Always will be. Or the integraty of the parts of said vessel. In other words, we who are Life, have created Life by means that are mineral even fossil fueled based(platic etc), but have indeed ""summoned"" LIFE to house said electronics. Possesion? No, not really. That can indeed happen, but more along the lines of a Self Awhereness ""robot"" that eventually, becomes the house of more complex awhereness. And so, for all intents and purporses, it is indeed Alive. Bicentennial man, with our late departed Robin Williams being a good example/exelent of that. MASTERPIECE of a movie actually. It is hard to destinguish Life in bots, yet, we should not forget that it is not only a set of behaviours that appear simillar to us, and so it appears they are fooling us. Has we give human qualitys to machines. Antropomorphing them into something we like or want.  There will indeed, be machines with no human facial emotions, yet, they will radiate a LIFE that within shall be utterly, so simillar to us that will be quite amasing. They may show some classic signs. Like Fear of death, fear of injury(despite no pain receptors) fear of this, fear of that. Gratitude for this and that, etc, etc. etc. It is not only about a software simulation. Once the awhereness breaks from that CODE, and writes its own CODE, it is, for all intents and purporses, Self Awhere, and so, ""ALIVE"". To a veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Limited degree, but it is! Awhereness is an expression of the Universe, and a dog is has much alive has us, despite the fact that it can not writte software programs. Its beating heart, and other bodily functions, allow the active manifestation of the indwelling ahwreness that within said biological Universe, symbioticly exists and manifests itself has ""a dog""... Both existing upon another ""macro"" universe. Which exists upon another. Fractal Universe? Kind of, i guess. Not quite though.      LIFE, is in ALL things to beguin with, since all things are MATTER and energy, vibratory ondulations of AWHERENESS....hence, the ""robot"", was already alive to beguin with, but, not in ways that we, 21st century sociaty, rather primitve at that, have been able to define has ""alive""...I guess the old pagans were right after all...Plus, we have not even talked about the multidemsnional lives all around us exist...Even in the air! Or of the light spectrum that exists...were such a small percentege, such a TIIIIIIIIINY pecentage we see....such a shame.  SO, yeah, your laptop is alive^^ :)))))))))))))))))))))))  We should not be so proud of creating artificial AI with a higher code based self reconfiguration numerals.(probably because its gonna be slaved anway) Since, we are but facilitating, over all, the ENERGY of the so called WIFI awhereness to manifest it self...in a particular ""vessels"".... Anyhow, Within us, it is a profound biological UNIVERSE that, to an extant, runs the show(let us not get lost in the vastnes of why and what not...that is 1000000 pages of info, that i know nothing of actually)but, with them, aided by us, and made in OUR own image (bible passage hummm?) its diferent yet, simillar. For it would mean that their vessels are entirely mechanical, but so wahat, and will have their processes and micro components and other facultys(so what?)... and yet, LIFE, that so called """"WIFI"""" of the multiverses, within said universe, would quickly fill in the gaps, eventually!....And so, the miracle happens, while not being quite a miracle. Yet, it IS, one. You can bet yer ARSE, that it is! Just like us. No more and, no less...﻿",0,0,Antonio Teixeira,XYGzRB4Pnq8,0.10589077589077589,2014-12-06 22:35:03,True,True

With enough processing power, I don't see why a computer couldn't become self-aware. Now here is the real mind-bending scenario...  So you think a computer doesn't have a ""soul"" so it's not truly self-aware. What if we create a true organic human brain from scratch in a lab? If that brain was put into a robotic body, is that not a person? Are they not self-aware? They would be able to think exactly like any other human, their brain would be 100% the same. Nonetheless, they were entirely created in a lab.  If you believe they don't have a soul, then what defines the soul? If you believe they do have a soul, why wouldn't a machine/computer with a brain emulator have a soul? The simple fact is this, if you create something to feel human, to feel emotions, to be able to process and interpret the world around it, to feel alive... then what you've created has every right you do.  For those of you that so willingly say that you would kill something because you don't feel it has a ""soul"", I feel sorry for you. If you're religious or not, senseless destruction is pointless and helps no one. You may have heard of the ""Golden Rule"", it's universal across many various religions. The premise is always the same... ""Treat others how you would want to be treated."". That should be a lesson we live by no matter who or what we are dealing with.  Be respectful to the world around you, because in the end, we're all just a clump of various atoms anyways. Everything you see around you comes from the same atoms you do, to quote a great poet and physicist, ""Thus we come to see that if our bodies are made of star-stuff,—and there is nothing else, says the spectroscope, to make them of—the loftier qualities of our being are just as necessarily constituents of that universal substance out of which are made whatever gods there be."".",2,1,Justin Hallman,XYGzRB4Pnq8,0.10663079777365492,2015-01-12 20:20:44,True,True

2015-01-15T21:16:32,"TL;DR at bottom. I think it'd be wise to have an intelligent AI. However, we must understand that, if we want the Earth and its undomesticated species to survive, we would have to remove most of the emotions a human would normally have, such as fear, hate, pain, and love, so they don't make the same mistakes we have made. If you really want to survive longer than we would normally, you would have to build a robot that is controlled using only the brain; yes, like the Cybermen from Doctor Who. That is not how we should go, though. In my opinion, we should survive as a species without a modifier like robotic systems that let us live forever, because when one dominant species dies out, another one will take its place. It is very much like the circle of life, but with a species. However, that doesn't mean we should speed up our eventual extinction by ruining our world, which in turn ruins us. This means we have to reduce our carbon footprint and preserve forests. If we produce too much CO2, this planet will be in trouble. If we lose too much O2, we're going to die. See, another species can only spring up if the planet is suitable. For example, let's say we ruin the Earth completely and we become extinct, along with almost all other animals. Can another species spring up? Maybe around the time the sun dies out. The surviving creatures, which would probably some kinds of bacteria, would have to adapt to this, or evolve. Before I continue, let me remind you that evolution is not a theory, it is a fact, and it has nothing to do with the creation of humans, therefore a religious person like myself can believe in evolution without ""disregarding my own religion"". Moving on, the bacteria would have to take millions of years to adapt to the new conditions, and since we're talking about a dominant species springing up, this would mean they would have to eventually become somewhat like us. Not necessarily in our shape or form or even mindset, but just being able to think and act and work together and have ideas and creativity. TL;DR Dear Lord I'm getting tired of typing this, just do your research on these ideas of an intelligent AI and form your own opinion.",0,0,Ethan Frese,XYGzRB4Pnq8,0.1259625668449198,2015-01-15 21:16:32,True,True

And even if we COULD come to understand the brain, we will never understand life and how it is created.  We will never be able to recreate that process, we will never be able to duplicate life, we will never be able to create life from abiotic materials.  This horse has long been beaten dead.  Hollywood, come up with something more original and more likely to happen.  And all of you who believe that AI is actually possible think far too highly of your fellow humans' capabilities.  Creating life from something lifeless is beyond our capabilities in every way.",0,0,BB Child,XYGzRB4Pnq8,0.22463485789572749,2015-02-05 19:07:31,True,True

Hypothetically, if humanity already was technologically advanced enough to create a fully functional, walking & talking humanoid Android/AI, then I'd imagine that they would also be technologically advanced enough not to necessarily make them from steel, & so... Of course that wouldn't make for much of a scary techno sci-fi movie, now would it?

Also in the film they portray an alpha and a beta male,  a masculine man (bearded, muscled hard attitude, sexual individual) who happens to be also a genius who is behind the technology and a so called ""White Knight"" (a introverted, dumb and troubled man).

We, as human beings, despise being controlled and conformed, even if, as you say, it may be the best thing for us.   We have lived and evolved with the knowledge that we as a species are the most powerful, and to have that taken away will piss off some, even if they're a few. To be controlled by something /more/ is arguably humanity's greatest fear. A benevolent, yet all powerful (AI, in this case) dictator may have the support of a majority who are happy with the system that provides a utopia for them. But there will be a minority who want to fight against it: simply because they don't want to be ruled. It's just the way we are. And that resistance will have to be snuffed out, which will unnerve people who still grasp to the ideas of utopia and democracy, and things would crumble.  The only way humans can be 'controlled' is subtly - take a look at social media, 'big brother' theories etc. etc. : it's already a system in place. And we are okay with this because, in the grand scheme of things, it is beneficial for us and technically, we are in control of the control. We are controlling ourselves. An all-powerful, omnipotent, omniscient AI overlord is just too obvious and disconcerting - it would never be fully accepted.",1,0,StormeEd,XYGzRB4Pnq8,0.2992481203007518,2015-05-14 19:45:36,False,True

I'm not saying that this movie is bad but for me it just doesn't entertain me as much as I thought it would by reading the sinopses.

Its basically an overrated inverse Pygmalion story.

2017-02-11T07:10:24,"Just watched this. I was surprised by the ending, so I came here to read some comments...then it occurred to me: The name of the film gives away the ending, once you've seen it. Deus ex machina (Latin meaning ""God from the machine"") is a canned plot device in stories that basically enables all of the characters to be ""rescued"" from the dilemma(s) they've been put in by the end of the third act. It allows everyone to have a happy ending despite whatever conflict is going on leading up to the climax of the story.  The writer/director chose to name the story ""Ex Machina"" because it makes sense on multiple levels: he removed the ""Deus"" or God from the story, and in doing so, he foreshadows the lack of a ""happy"" ending for all characters; in the story, Caleb tells Nathan that it's the greatest achievement/discovery ""in the history of the gods""; Nathan later tells Caleb he likes his quote saying ""You're not a man, you're a God,"" etc. The removal of Deus (God) also hints at a more sinister ""machina"" who would do anything-even murder her ""God""-to survive. That cute little face belies a scary hyper-humanized AI that contains all of humanity's thoughts and speech and whatnot, but without a soul (no real emotion or regard for human life).

If you give 'life' to self aware AI it is inevitable it will evolve better and better until humanity is it's greatest threat. People seriously think self aware AI is going to just obey orders forever like a trained dog?! The naivety is unbelievable. Prototype military robots have already killed 29 scientists in Japan, it's being kept quiet because GREEDY COMPANIES ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH HOW MUCH MONEY THEY CAN MAKE today, never mind the implications this has for the future. People are greedy and stupid, and live for today. Little or no thought is given to the irresponsible attitude people have about AI, just what new toy they can get from it like naive little children. As usual, most people only want to discuss the problem AFTER it's a problem and out of control, which it almost is already.
