2017-07-26T04:48:23,"Looks like a good movie it is just clearly selective on which parts of the riots its going to show to make it seem like white people just started killing blacks for no reason. Like the fact that the riots started when a large group of African-Americans attacked police officers while they were making a mass arrest of African Americans running an illegal bar which if you run an illegal bar is totally justified for arrest. Or that once the riots started they administered a curfew and instead of following it a lot of African Americans started looting local businesses who had nothing to do with the arrests and started shooting random white people, store owners who were trying to stop their stores from being robbed, police officers who were responding to sniper fire, and firefighters who were trying to rally people to help. I guarantee those parts won’t be shown. And in most cases where black were shot and killed its because they were trying to loot stores or break roadblocks or just generally not following police orders. I really wish this movie would show these parts of the riots but I promise it won’t. Also not to mention the fact that if you are in a city in a state of emergency and a lot of innocent people have been killed you shouldn’t be shooting any kind of firearm whether it be real or a starter pistol. These police responded because they were afraid of a sniper killing more people. And when the police did show up to the motel instead of telling the police where the pistol was immediately and ending the issue then and there they waited until the situation escalated and got out of hand before finally admitted one of them had a fake pistol. So yeah it seems like an interesting movie it will just clearly be very biased against white people and won’t show a lot of the actual events that took place like a lot of the black on white crime and blacks refusal to follow direct orders and continue to loot, rob and kill innocent people.",3,0,Tim Robinson,wmQebVSsRbA,0.04947089947089947,2017-07-26 04:48:23,False,True

People destroyed their own neighborhood and refused to stop so the Army's paratroopers were mobilized by Lyndon B Johnson (people were angry at the police and were upset of the violence police caused unjustly). There were also rumors of snipers and during this time the national guard (not the army) were present and accidentally mistook a cigarette in an apartment window for a laser of some sort and killed a girl and a woman. Rioters refused to stop and soon house to house searches were taken place (national guard and the police, again not the Army itself).

2018-01-03T20:37:50,"Folks, hey. Some individuals here criticize ""Detroit"" because: a White woman was the director; Afro-Brits took major roles from African Americans, some Black sisters and brothers assert; it's divisive to race relations, some White sisters and brothers claim, stating they have no skin in the game and aren't racist; that's not how that shit went down in '67;  it makes Blacks into victims, surmise a few Blacks and Whites. Etc.  Interesting. And it's typical given the country's legacy of slavery, segregation, law and custom which forcefully undermines Black determination to overcome the past with justice. Why can't this country deal honestly with these issues? How do you get the numerous American factions to come to grips with a cancer that's daily tearing the fabric of this country? How do you demonstrate to White citizens -- most of whom don't SEE -- what the country has wrought, and how they are damaged too by a foundational system that makes them, consciously and unconsciously, feel superior to us? How do you get folks to be ""woke"" to the necessity for constructing serious, targeted policies/laws which advance Black self-determination specifically? What must the body-politic do...What do Whites and Blacks have to give up to make this a reality?
