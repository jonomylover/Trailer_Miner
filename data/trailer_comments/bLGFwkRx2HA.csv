2015-08-23T03:09:00,"I have not watched this film, so I’ll make my comments just based off this trailer. If I’m “judging a book by its cover” or “by its summary”, feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.  It is unfortunate that this film turns such serious and gruesome secret government projects such as “MK Ultra” and “Project Monarch” into a comedy. This project has destroyed thousands of lives. Mind control programming is a serious topic that people still suffer from to this point. They may have only retired the name MK Ultra in the 70s; however, mind control projects were never ended and continue to this day.  The main character in this film appears to be a “Delta” programmed assassin that was activated by a “handler” when the woman enters into the shop and says (what seems to us) random words to him — which is a process known as “triggering” where a mind control subject is triggered into their “alter” state (other programmed personality) and is then ready to play the role they were programmed to play. These “random words” are in actuality an activation code. Just like a password to open an email. This is a password to activate an alternate personality that was programmed into this person. Also, only a handler is usually able to activate the alter personality within the subject. Thus this woman, most likely, has known the main character of the film since he was a child.  From the trailer, I can see that his personality is a “Delta”. A “Delta” programmed subject is a code word for a programmed assassin who can be activated at any time. This person has a programmed alter personality, so he may be just living a regular life without even being aware of his alter personality; however, they also suffer from visions or “voices in their head”, so it is not uncommon for these people to suffer from drug abuse. It’s is interesting that the main character in this film is a drug addict. It fits the script. People that have undergone torturous mind control programing have bipolar disorders that have been synthetically programmed into them.  It’s important to note that mind control programming is even more relevant today than it was when the original project MK Ultra was active. Don’t you ever wonder about how can someone walk into a theater, kill dozens of people, and then when asked about it, he has no recollection of doing it and doesn’t even know why he did it? And also at the same time, he was taking various psychiatric drugs? You probably know who I’m talking about and this is just the example of what we’re not being told about mind control programs.  For those of you being exposed to this for the very first time, I suggest reading this article from the Vigilant Citizen: http://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/origins-and-techniques-of-monarch-mind-control/ This article is a crash course into this topic and there are tons of books that you can read about this topic if you want to get deeper.  Mind control programming is a serious science that has been abused by government scientists since the early to mid 20th century (its origins go into ancient times). This is not funny. Making fun and light of this topic is the same thing as making a comedy about The Holocaust during WWII. The suffering the victims of mind control have gone through with the gruesome and torturous methods that have been executed on them while they were little (primarily foster home) children in order to break their minds before being able to program them, are unspeakable and horrendous. So many souls broken, so many deaths, so much needless suffering.",0,0,Our Solaris,bLGFwkRx2HA,-0.004089506172839508,2015-08-23 03:09:00,False,True

2016-01-27T01:28:30,"There was a recent class-action lawsuit by those who believed they were being attacked by the CIA. Not sure if it is still going on, but there was a declassified Army document that said the government has psychotronic weapons of harassment and described some of the things you may be going through. FOIA baby! That's why they filed the suit. I have seen the document. Look it up for yourselves and do a search for psychotronics. Note also that Russia is supposedly saying it will use psychotronic weapons on the battlefield in 2020 and going forward and that the technology to read minds remotely is also being discovered by mainstream science (not sure how the CIA got it before everyone else did, but hey,) and the mind is considered the new final frontier and lots of advancements are being made. Meaning what? Meaning the CIA can research this shit overtly. Meaning what? Maybe one day it will stop. MIT just had the first telepathic conversation (in 2015,) and we can read people's minds/EEG signals over wifi. It makes sense, our brains output a 12Hz - 26Hz radio signal (think cell phones and why they might be harmful or cause cancer,) anyway (not sure the exact Hz frequency off the top of my head.) Strange but true. But sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction. Your modern day brainwashing is being done through psychotronics and is the legacy of the MKULTRA program. They keep starting new projects and that keeps politicians from looking into these programs (I think John Kerry was asking the CIA about this stuff at a certain point.) Also, lastly, I think some of these mass shooters have been victims. Don't let this scare you, as your life is not meant for murder under any circumstances and nobody can force you to do these horrible things even a brainwasher. They say everyone has a physical breaking point in resisting brainwashing. This is caused by anxiety, privation and sleep deprivation, if they can swing it, and through death threats (they will never kill you,) and perilous concocted scenarios. Again, like I said it's best to just perfect the art of not listening. Another thing you might find as one of many silver linings about your situation is that for research purposes they are likely to have saved your memories and your history under the program on DoD hard drives. You have a legacy. Hopefully it will be used to help our government so that our service people will never have to worry about brainwashing or psychotronics quite the way we do today. I kicked their ass too, so today I have a lot less worries than I have seen in some harsher cases of this. Plus, I think you will be wasting most Psychiatrists' time if you are not legitimately crazy. Remember clearly I am nuts, that's why I typed all of this. Clearly.
