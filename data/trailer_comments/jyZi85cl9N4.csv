2014-06-25T15:05:40,"If all emergency services are suspended for one night, I bet they are SWAMPED as hell the next morning, people probably going to the hospital like:  ""Hey can you put my arm back on, Grandma Jones down the street chopped it off."" ""Will you please stitch up my wounds, I got shot last night trying to purge, I missed, my bad.""  Personally I see the humor, in the story lines, it is so unrealistic, that one night a year everyone just goes around killing people, and then the next day everyone acts like it never happened. If this was true, America would turn into feeling-less zombies with no capability for remorse, no conscience and that is called a psychopath and the country would fall into nothing, there would be not social functioning prior to the purge, or post-purge.  If this ever REALLY happened in America, where ""non-psychopathic"" persons could go from just dropping their kids off at school, drinking tea with their neighbors, and playing sand volleyball, to maliciously and consciously murdering total strangers, or even people they know and cohabited with, then America would collapse upon itself. ""Crime would be a an all time low"" not because people are good people and just want to be bad for one night a year, it is at an all time low because the people in that society would be SO EXTREMELY paranoid that they would NOT DARE steal, cheat, lie, thieve, destroy, slander, gossip, rape, kill out of fear that THAT will happen to them on the night of the purge.  The flaw in this movie is that the people, and the society within in it act as those they have nothing to lose for one night, yet that is the very night they have EVERYTHING to lose and they act like the rest of the year when crime in illegal they have something to lose, when in all reality they are just perpetually paranoid, not ""good-wholesome"" citizens.   But to go with my theory and play along for the movie this is my perception and that there would be three types of people in this purge-society, they are as follows:  1. The Common Ordinary: The are the opposite of the elites, they are your average person, just statistics really. Just the meat in the steak of society, existing and dying at the same rate, but make up most of the population. These are the low hanging fruit, if you will, for the night of the purge, if I were to be honest. These are the people that, are not perpetually paranoid of crime, they are generally not psychopathic, nor aggressive, not involved in crime or deceit at all really. They are just trying to get by, live, have families and get through the night. They are easy targets due to economic status, which lessens their ability to hide from purgers.  The Common Ordinary, is who The Middlemen target as to not be targeted themselves.   2. The Middlemen: They are your ""bulk-purgers"", if you will. They are the people that roam the street most of the night, causing destruction, killing sporadically, mostly destroying property, and causing a scene to instill fear in any potential victim. These are the people who have a good living, make enough money really do not struggle financially, they come from perhaps well off families, that do not associate with crime, but they also  have not been taught proper values. Do not misinterpret  their group gathering as some sort of vulnerability, these purgers may be  traveling together, however there in no one leader. They are together for the sheer idea that there in strength in numbers. These purgers could be taken out if you have the right tools, but also could take YOU out just as easily, if you are of the same region of living. The problem with these purgers is that they are extremists, they have nothing to lose, and mentality of everything to gain, they won't run away, and they WILL outrun you. These are the people to whom they warn you about, they having been preparing all year for this night, and are the reason you NEED to stay off the street if you want to survive the night.  3. The Elitists: These are the true psychopathic killers, these are the people with more money and opportunities then they know what to do with. These are the people that have enough tools to purge half the city if they wanted, but seem to focus on a specific target, or group. Now sometimes, that target is pre-planned ahead of The Purge, and sometimes, most of the time, their targets are chosen at random, their targets could be either The Common Ordinary or The Middlemen, to the elitists their practically the same. These people most likely commit relational crimes during the year, they lie, deceive, are incapable of feelings. These are the people that live to kill, but are so afraid of dying themselves, that it is their only weakness, unlike The Middlemen, they have everything to lose, and will do anything and everything as to make sure they don't lose it. If they are looking for you, you can try to hide, but they will find you, you can try to run, but they will catch you, you can try and kill them, but they never die. If they want you dead, you'll die. My best suggestion is to run, fight, and wait until the sunrise.....or be purged.       Hoped y'all enjoyed my play along theories, my question to you is which would YOU be?

Something for the sick-o fan boys to drool over. In one scene there were 4 females and one male all together in a line. Who was killed? The one male, of course. Or the scene with the female shooter in the apt. Nothing happened to her either. And, they just had to make sure the male body count was over the top with the ending where they sent in a dozen males to be slaughtered while protecting the rich people's retreat.
