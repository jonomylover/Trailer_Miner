2016-06-23T20:36:04,"People should really stop judging the movie before they see it, especially based off of the trailer. Movie trailers nowadays are like mini-films themselves. They're created by companies completely separate from the production team of the film itself. An entirely different group of people that weren't involved with the making of the film receive a rough copy of a movie and have to think of a way to present it to captivate the widest possible audience. They use many tactics to do this, and a lot of what goes into movie trailer production is a manipulation of the actual film itself. Scenes play out and are edited differently in trailers than in the actual film many times. So stop being so judgmental and wait for the actual film to come out before you say anything. And if you KNOW you're not going to see the film, why are you taking the time out of your day to post about it and be so negative instead of doing something else with your time? Are your comments even productive? There's a difference between giving and honest, constructive opinion of a film and simply saying ""this looks awful lol"" or ""this will FLOP"".

When I was 11 years old (I'm 25 now), my enemy was my grandmother: Nana Dumpling.   She told me to hide myself in my parents room till I learned how to breathe less.   So I went to their room, and opened my mother's panty drawer. They smelled like Downy. :3 mmmmm. *drools*  And I found a note in the deep end of the top drawer and it said ""don't look in the attic.""   I obviously went to the attic because I thought the note was referring to candy. I went up there and found a box. I went through it and found an Ouiji board. Under it was vhs tape that said ""mom's secret affair"" but I didn't pay much attention to it.   So I took the board and violated Nana rules and told her what I found. She picked it up and started hitting me with it. It hurt like a bitch. She hit my face and spanked my ass with it.  So I warn you guys. Beware, because an Ouiji board can hurt you.Ôªø",221,41,WhiteEmerald1991,MJIcZGEjjwo,0.09166666666666667,2016-09-20 08:52:57,True,True

Not only did they do it once, but now they're gonna make a sequel everybody! I don't understand how a human being can be genuinely interested in watching a movie that is based on a FUCKING BOARD GAME. It's not scary. It's not compelling. It's not interesting. It's not different. It's cheap, it's lazy, it's pathetic, and to be frank, it's a disgrace, and is a perfect example of what is wrong with the film industry in this day in age. We've reached a point in time in which creativity is so scarce, that filmmakers are resorting to using fucking board games you play with your family on a boring ass Sunday night, as a foundation behind what their inspiration is for making a film. The first piece of shit board game Ouija film made $103 million dollars because of the fact that uneducated, dimwitted, teenagers who are scared of loud noises and a piece of cardboard on the ground, paid their parents' money to go see a film that was designated exactly for the fools who were moronic enough to shell out money to see something as ridiculous as this. They've created this sequel, not because the first broke barriers; not because it brought a new style to the art of film; not because it was graced with oscar worthy performances. But because it made MONEY. If you honestly have any sort of dignity, any sort of awareness of what genuine, quality, creative, and innovative film is, don't see this movie. Please.

Take a step and notice how demonic this material is and how your enjoying this garbage. Your basically enjoying demons possessing people to brutally murder and torment others. Contacting mediums to carry out Satanic practices on Earth isn't harmless. There is dark magic in this world and God tells us to avoid such witchcraft.  I once involved myself in Quija and it does possess power through the spirit world. You feel pure evil during your time opening this demonic gateway.   The truth is evil is placed strategically to get you to socially accept it as ""art"" or ""entertainment"". Its really a clever scam that has so many fooled. Satan is behind this influence. God doesn't approve of this heretical nonsense. Ignore it and seek Christ and accept him as your Lord who provides in return everlasting life.

2016-10-22T19:56:47,"This msg is for those who don't believe in the spiritual world. The Ouija board is real and is a gateway for demonic spirits to come in. Just like the native american dreamcatcher allows demonic spirits into the world. Cern is doing the same thing. They just had a quote unquote mock human sacrifice at Cern at 3am in front of the demon Hindu god Shiva (the god of destruction) but we don't want to talk about facts do we? Of course not, it's ALL make believe. There are 4 dimensions of this world, length, width, height and breadth as it states in the Holy Bible: Ephesians 3:18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height. The 4th dimension is the spiritual realm that you cannot see. Ever heard of ghosts? Those are lower level demons, usually taking on a loved one that has past on. They can even sound like your loved one that has past. Ghosts usually just drop things in your house or make noises to freak you out. We ALL have demons in our lives (that know us very well, and can even mimic your voice) trying to make us sin against the Lord. Whether it be sexual, or love of money, or whatever, we all make a choice to do what is right or wrong. Demons help influence those decisions of the flesh. Once you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, making the right decision is so much easier. Here is what the Bible says about the spiritual realm, and notice there are 4 points: Ephesians 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against (1) principalities, (2) against powers, (3) against the rulers of the darkness of this world, (4) against spiritual wickedness in high places. That's how those psychics know about your life and others associated with you, when you call into one of them. They (the psychic) channel (necromancy) your demon or others you know and get information from them. As America turns it's back on God, you WILL see much, much worse than a naked demonic possessed man chewing the face off of another man and eating it. Much, much worse. We are running out of time folks.  Turn to Jesus Christ with all your heart now, before it's too late.",0,0,Metaledge100,MJIcZGEjjwo,0.07004926108374385,2016-10-22 19:56:47,False,True

2017-02-19T16:43:09,"Satan and his demons can use the Ouija board to give advice, or even to guide a person in a certain direction. This guidance may even seem to be true, good, and helpful. Satan and his demons pretend to be caring. They try to appear as something that appears harmless. The Bible says, ""And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve"" (2 Corinthians 11:14-15).   Satan and his demons will do this in order to get a person even more deeply involved in spiritist practices. Things like the Ouija board appear to be innocent at first, but soon a person finds themselves addicted to guidance from the spirit world - thereby allowing Satan to control and destroy their life. 1 Peter 5:8 warns us, ""Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.""   The Ouija Board may be advertised as just as game, and that is exactly what Satan wants us to believe. Sadly, many people are deceived into believing that Ouija Boards ARE just a game. The truth of the matter is that God views channeling, or consulting spirits or the dead, to be a serious sin.",0,0,Maurice Rivers,MJIcZGEjjwo,0.08783068783068784,2017-02-19 16:43:09,False,False

Slight spoilers to end:    If the planchette thing moves all around on it's own, without anyone touching it, why is no one REALLY disconcerted by that?   or the daughter writing Polish? And how's she even know what Polish looks like??   Why wasn't the boy VERY disconcerted at the girls description of being choked to death?

2019-12-22T13:13:15,"Every evil doer stands guilty of his/her evil. Evil is a tangible quantity. It is measured in pain. Words can be evil too. Punishment of evil words is evil words. The victim may choose to keep silent however, in this case the sentence is automatically canceled when the offender or victim leave the scene. Spoken evil words must be responded to in the same session. Broadcasted evil words may be responded to within a traditional paper post reply time, say 10 days after watching or hearing the broadcast, by mail (even email, audio/video recording) and not by a broadcast of your own.  Written evil may be responded to within unlimited time period through written response. You may response via a phone call in any case. If you are late in responding then first ask permission to respond to an older evil speech/text if the author/speaker is still alive. For dead ones, you can respond in whatever manner you want. Politeness easily eliminates evil speech of others. Coming back to one of the key points. The owner/creator of evil stands guilty of all evil in association with the evil doers/sayers. It would not be a just decision to relieve the creator of evil from the burden of sins/crimes of the creatures, including intelligent creations.  If Jesus died because of the sins of Christians then Christians should nominate/select just one person (male or female) from among themselves to receive the reward of sin removal. That person will receive the soul of Jesus. This is the philosophy of second coming. This can be done only once so please don't choose peter north ok.  Messiah would recommend that you choose a young caucasian male who is desperately looking for redemption. Why male?  Because we don't know how Jesus would respond to a female host/body. A soul for a soul. Not all Christians can be set free from sins for someone's worship worth of 33 years. I have even counted his toilet times. Choose when you are ready to receive Jesus. If Jesus comes to earth while Messiah is alive then Messiah would like to have a face to face chat with him. üòÅ",0,0,Muhammad Asif,MJIcZGEjjwo,-0.28368794326241137,2019-12-22 13:13:15,False,False
