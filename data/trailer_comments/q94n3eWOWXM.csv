The tank used for filming was an M4A2E8, never actually used by the US army (although the Russians did, and they liked them quite a bit). It's meant to substitute for an M4A3E8, which the army did field. The T23 turret should be an obvious giveaway for the more knowledgeable. 2. Yes, the Sherman would be capable of taking out a Tiger. In fact, ANY M4 would be capable of taking out a Tiger; even the short 75mm could penetrate the sides at ranges of 650 meters. The 76mm can go through the sides at distances of over 2 kilometers with standard ammunition, with the front being penetrable out to about 1 km with an unangled shot (practical penetration range was more like 400 m). 3. Yes, the E8 could survive a frontal shot from a Tiger at close range, particularly at that angle.

2014-07-17T04:05:02,"As to the comments about the Tiger round bouncing off the Sherman. The clips don't really show how close the Tiger was at the time of the fabled shot. I get the sense that in the movie the Shermans are ambushed by a Tiger, who kills one tank at 2:14 and then as he tries to traverse his turret to hit tank number two now moving off to his flank, he gets shot in the turret ring at 2:16 which deflects off to its left. The Ricochet off the Sherman at 2:15 could have been from the beginning of the scene, now out of chronological order. In-fact, it does even appear to be the same tank, noticing the lack of the painted ""Fury"" on the barrel on the left side. This is probably when the two tank crews first became aware of the Tigers presence, and thus it is feasible that the German tank was much farther away when this shot was fired. Also, we never actually see the Tiger destroyed, just some random explosion at 2:18, notice the Shermans turret orientation is completely different on the last shot, chances are this is not the Tiger at all, and a clip from a different scene entirely, unfortunately there is no identifiable part in the short clip to possibly identify what exactly is being destroyed.

And before I get people responding to me saying, ""Oh well a Sherman NEVER could beat a Tiger!"" Actually, yes it could. Well this version at least. Its main gun is a 76mm Gun on it, which was previously only used on tank destroyers. This gun did in fact have the power and range to penetrate a Tiger tank's armor, IF it hit it in the right spot, (I.E. Engine Compartment, Tank Treads, Ammo Compartment, ETC). Also don't forget that the Sherman, even with the heavier 76mm gun, was faster and WAY more maneuverable then the much slower and clunky Tiger. Now, I'm not saying the Tiger is a bad tank, cus it is FAR from that, but if two or three M4A3E8's went up against one or two Tigers in a short range engagement, I would probably pick the Sherman's, purely based off of their superior speed and maneuverability. Now, at a a medium-longe range engagement, that is when I would pick the Tiger, due to its far superior armor and its deadly accurate 88mm Gun. But either ways, BOTH are respectively the best tanks each either nation could produce and put on the battlefield.

It's an early model that was captured in Africa which you can easily determine by the commander's cupola, the wheels and also the Feifel filters (on museum pics). Later models had so-called steel wheels and a lower cupola with periscope sights. The driver also got periscope sights. There were many additional changes and if you want to know more about all the technical aspects, I recommend the books from Walter Spielberger and Thomas Jentz about the Tiger and Panther.  There's a little anecdote in a Panther book from Ryton Publications. Ernst Barkmann, one of the ""Panther aces"" is asked which allied tanks were the most dangerous for the Panther and he answered that on the Eastern Front, it was the Stalin tank (IS-2) and on the Western Front it was the USAAF. ;-)",0,0,Holztransistor,q94n3eWOWXM,0.15590277777777775,2014-08-16 11:44:22,True,True

When Brad Pitt asks Norman if he's down some killin' and Norman replies no, Pitt tosses him the grease gun and tells Grady to teach him how to use it. Grady says something to the effect of...""You see that right there? Open it: now you killin, close it: now ya ain't."" The scene where Gordo his describing the scene a few days after Normandy. Just shows you how much war traumatizes people. All of Bible's teary eyed scenes. Many more scenes to count. And the fact that they didn't really shine a light on war, they certainly didn't try to make it look like such a glorious thing. Sure there were Americans in this movie and they were kickin' ass, but in the end most of them died horrible deaths. We're so used to seeing violence that we wont even bat an eye for that kind of violence. If you stop to think, there is no rhetoric for violence anywhere and especially not in war. Violence is a terrible thing for us to experience no matter what the circumstance. Fury is not a movie about characters like Saving Private Ryan was and I think it's unfair to compare the two because the theme, story and overall mood are completely different. But that's the point. The characters ARE the violence, they gave it and they took it. Personally I believe getting wrapped up in specifics bogs down a movie and ruins the experience, but I also realize not to take it personal because most of the time it has nothing to do with the movie but rather how people are.  The short all of that is: watch the movie and decide for yourself. I recommend you open yourself up to feelings rather than trying to pick it apart with your mind. Perhaps you'll have the same experience that I had; a fresh look into how violence grows and becomes apart of us and how tragic it is when that happens.",1,0,Peter Som,q94n3eWOWXM,0.011784511784511783,2014-10-29 20:16:09,False,True

I can forgive the fact that the Tiger I is charging forward to engage the column of Shermans in close combat, thus giving up it's superior firepower at range and armor protection. We may say that they are just being reckless at that point. What I cannot forgive, however, is the final scene.

2015-12-11T10:29:07,"Интересная история  Для всех, что бы знали и помнили: 6-я танковая дивизия вермахта 48 часов воевала с одним-единственным советским танком КВ-1. Этот эпизод подробно описан в мемуарах полковника Эрхарда Рауса, чья группа пыталась уничтожить советский танк.  Пятидесятитонный КВ-1 расстрелял и раздавил своими гусеницами колонну из 12 грузовиков со снабжением, которая шла к немцам из захваченного города Райсеняй. Потом прицельными выстрелами уничтожил артиллерийскую батарею. Немцы, разумеется, вели ответный огонь, но безрезультатно. Снаряды противотанковых пушек не оставляли на его броне даже вмятин – пораженные этим немцы позже дали танкам КВ-1 прозвище «Призрак». Да что пушки – броню КВ-1 не могли пробить даже 150-миллиметровые гаубицы. Правда, солдатам Рауса удалось обездвижить танк, взорвав снаряд у него под гусеницей.  Но «Клим Ворошилов» и не собирался никуда уезжать. Он занял стратегическую позицию на единственной дороге, ведущей в Райсеняй, и двое суток задерживал продвижение дивизии (обойти его немцы не могли, потому что дорога проходила через болота, где вязли армейские грузовики и легкие танки). Наконец, к исходу второго дня сражения Раусу удалось расстрелять танк из зениток. Но, когда его солдаты опасливо приблизились к стальному чудовищу, башня танка внезапно повернулась в их сторону – видимо, экипаж все еще был жив. Лишь брошенная в люк танка граната поставила точку в этом невероятном сражении. Так, что сюжет этого фильма взят из реальной истории, но только советского народа, а не американского.  Вот другое описание этого боя, взятое из послевоенного отчета группы немецких офицеров в американском плену. «Один из КВ сумел перекрыть маршрут снабжения немецких войск в районе северного плацдарма. Он блокировал его несколько дней. Сначала он сжег колонну грузовиков с боеприпасами и продовольствием. Подобраться к этому монстру было невозможно — дороги проходили среди болот. Передовые немецкие части лишились снабжения. Тяжелораненые не могли эвакуироваться в тыл и умирали. Попытка уничтожить танк 50-мм противотанковой батареей с расстояния 500 м окончилась тяжелыми потерями личного состава и орудий. КВ остался невредимым, несмотря, как выяснилось впоследствии, на 14 прямых попаданий — но они оставили лишь синие пятна на его броне. Была подтянута 88-мм зенитка, танк позволил ей встать на позицию в 700 м, а затем расстрелял, прежде чем расчет смог произвести хотя бы один выстрел. Ночью были посланы минеры. Они заложили взрывчатку под гусеницы КВ. Заряды взорвались как положено, однако смогли лишь вырвать несколько кусков из траков. Танк остался мобильным и продолжал блокировать маршрут снабжения. В первые дни экипаж танка снабжался припасами окруженцами и местными жителями, но потом вокруг танка была установлена блокада. Однако даже эта изоляция не заставила танкистов покинуть позицию. В итоге немцы применили хитрость. 50 немецких танков стали обстреливать КВ с трех направлений, чтобы отвлечь его внимание. В это время 88-м зенитка была скрытно установлена в тылу КВ. Она 12 раз попала в танк, и три снаряда пробили броню, уничтожив его».  Экипаж танка КВ-1, героически погибщий в июне 1941 года у дер. Дайняй (на дороге в 5 км от г. Райсеняй): - Ершов П.Е., Смирнов В.А., воин с инициалами Ш.Н.А. и три неизвестных воина.
