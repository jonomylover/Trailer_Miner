You're already a sheeple for having a specified faith LOL can't imagine why separation from church and state is a thing. Why were Americas founders deists? Belief in universal life. More evidence suggests other theories in earths past than those told in biblical text to the exact description, because biblical text is garbage for lack of caring for a better word and literally analyzed for its writing techniques in schooling which is incredibly simple to understand. Atheism is just as ignorant and blatantly dumb. Scientology is as close as you get to 'cult' but I bet Cruise doesn't even fully understand or follow the beliefs. You're judging someone for living how they want and being open about it which could even be compared to the judgement of closeted homosexuals (oh look another dumbass thing fanatics are negative towards). Just FYI the philosophical theory that souls are reincarnated throughout the universe is pretty smart and one of the Scientology depictions, grow some balls and open your minds you cattle.
