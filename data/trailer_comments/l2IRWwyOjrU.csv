I subscribed to Breaking In Youtube channel. It's good to see hot black women like Gabrielle and Taraji Henson playing tough characters beating up bad guys this year.

2018-09-03T03:42:53,"This trailer looked absolutely thrilling, and I was hooked, but only up until the point where the sole selling point for the movie became the fact that she is a mother.  I'm not saying this out of sexism or prejudice of any kind. Between the plot, the cinematography and underlying sense of anticipation coupled with the great timing of this trailer, this movie seems strong enough as it is.   Personally I feel as though something has been taken away from it, and almost that it has been cheapened in a way by making it a movie that has the singular appeal of having a main character who is not just a woman, but a mother. I don't understand why that has to be it's main selling point when there seems to be so much more to it in addition to that.  If it was instead marketed as the thriller that it comes off as being, that also just so happens to have a main character who is a mother, then we could judge it for the substance of it's storytelling, characters and cinematography instead of making it some statement on female strength and courage.  Honestly I find that more than times than not, strong female characters who stick with audiences and leave an impact on people long after they have left the theater, are handled the same way strong characters in any form of media are handled. You have to let the audience meet your character and grow alongside them, letting the viewer see the good and bad side of them while they traverse their way through their plotline and character arc. You cannot just tell the audience that a character is a strong, confident, and capable individual who is deserving of their time and attention, regardless of gender, without trying to prove all of that to your viewer first and then letting them make the decision about the character for themselves.",0,1,Trevor Walsh,l2IRWwyOjrU,0.21839080459770113,2018-09-03 03:42:53,False,False
