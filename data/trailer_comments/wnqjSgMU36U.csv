Every few years it's like the public is forced sympathize with one over the other. Some years Mary is the passionate, independent spirit who became an unfortunate victim and Elizabeth is the awful schemer who mercilessly ordered Mary's head to be chopped off. Other years Mary is the naive, politically inexperienced and impulsive fool who is solely to blame for her own doom and Elizabeth as the wise, cautious and more realistic queen, has no option but to contrive a reason for Mary's execution in order to secure her own rule. I guess this new movie is going to be more sympathetic towards Mary so it's back to thinking Elizabeth was unduly harsh and ruthless. Whatever.

It's basically not historical fiction at all, it's just fiction using some historical names for its characters, no different than Abraham Lincoln vampire slayer.  Mary probably didn't have a Scottish accent.  She moved to France when she was 5 years old, and lived there until she was almost 18.  She's known for her French ways and manners, due to spending so much time in the French court.  Even if she had stayed in Scotland her whole life, like most 16th century Scottish nobles she wouldn't have such a strong accent.  Mary and Elizabeth were never friends, and they never met each other in real life.  And why is the film trying to argue that it was men that poisoned this friendly relationship between the two?  There were many factors that caused strife between the two, including Mary's claiming of the English throne and the threat she posed to Elizabeth, the religious conflict going on in Britain between Catholics and Protestants (Mary was Catholic and Elizabeth was Protestant), and the alliance between Scotland and France (England's enemy).  Overall it feels like the movie is saturated with leftist propaganda with its inaccurate multiculturalism and the vilification of all the male characters.

Seriously, I love studying this period in history, especially the story of these two women, and this trailer made me CRINGE so much. (Mary, sweetie, why are you wearing armor?)  I'm mostly just tired of the takes on these two women. In the end, the movie will inevitably force the viewer to side with one over the other. Mary will be portrayed as a naive innocent or a scheming, prettier rival, and Elizabeth will be cast as the jealous, cruel monarch or the level-headed but reluctant executioner (spoilers!). Seems like they're going with Mary as the one you should side with in this one. I just want one movie that has them face off and not vilify one over the other. Have the audience struggle with questions over who they should sympathize with. That would actually show them as human and would provide real substance.  Also, why are they seemingly pushing the narrative that jealous mens drove them apart? Wouldn't it be more interesting if these two had actual ambitions of their own? Maybe start eyeballing each others thrones while struggling with other tense political situations and the fact that they are technically family (although from a messed up family)? Not to say men weren't involved, they were, but if you're going to tell the story of Mary and Elizabeth have it actually be about Mary and Elizabeth! Doing this just makes them look like pawns in someone else's game!  In the end, this just looks like a ton of Oscar Bait, and not even good Oscar Bait. Shame too.

2018-07-29T20:27:06,"I keep reading people in the comments creating about ‚Äúhistorical accuracy‚Äù, which I feel really limits you to the huge possibilities of enjoying a potentially powerful film. Firstly, I doubt that a large team of filmmakers with a vast budget of millions will have begun making this film without the simple knowledge of this subject. As is evident, almost everyone knows / thinks these two never met. This is based on a historical event, but the story makers can adapt whatever the hell they like in order to make the film they choose. It is their creation, their art. Who‚Äôs to say the director didn‚Äôt make this with the idea of what these two figures would have said to each other had they ever met?  People love to act smart and try and dissect films (before even seeing them), but you‚Äôve got to take every adaptation with a pinch of salt. If it was to be a through and through historical film, you‚Äôd be watching a documentary. Think about the volume of idiots who shunned Gladiator for its ‚Äúinaccuracies‚Äù, missing the vast deal of emotional power it held over so many audiences.   My advice is, take a breath, watch this trailer again and seek for something else other than faults. You‚Äôre missing out on the enjoyment of life by being picky.  Also, feel free to not berate me for expressing a sensitive opinion to filmmaking. I‚Äôm also a human and don‚Äôt deserve any ignorant hate speech.

The ‚ÄúLady Bird‚Äù star shot her portions of the film in Scotland, while Robbie filmed in England. The two actresses made the decision to be kept apart so that their characters‚Äô one meeting would feel as powerful as possible on set and on camera.  Historians believe Elizabeth and Mary never met in real life, but Rourke told EW she was inspired by¬†the 19th-century Friedrich Schiller play ‚ÄúMary Stuart,‚Äù which includes a fictional scene of the two characters talking face-to-face on stage.  ‚ÄúThe whole conception of the film for me was around that meeting,‚Äù Rourke said. ‚ÄúWe really wanted to have¬†our¬†version of that famous scene, with these two women looking at each other and being confronted with their choices ‚Äî their personal choices, their political choices.

Alienated her nobles and people.     Married a spoilt immature drunk, arranged his murder when she grew tired of him, acquitted the murderer then MARRIED him.    Was forced to abdicate by her exasperated nobles, escaped house arrest where she would have been comparatively safe, barged into England uninvited where she had little to no friends or supporters, to throw herself on Elizabeth's mercy; only to openly and in cold blood plot to assassinate her and usurp her throne with her only defence being, 'I'm a Queen, you can't touch me.'    Elizabeth had no choice but to execute her, a decision that she AGONISED over, and still brought down the wrath of Spain upon her (Liz won that one too though.) Mary had not a tenth of Elizabeth's shrewdness, statecraft, foreign policy or common sense. All she had going for her were beauty and charm, and they deserted her quickly enough. She'd grown up cosseted and pampered as well as Catholic in France, (Which means she should have a French accent as well) how could she hope to rule Protestant Scotland or her subjects?     -    So rather than see that, we're going to see a glorified SNP propaganda piece with the beautiful innocent and fierce Mary be martyred by the murderous evil English led by Queen Elizabeth, who rather than shown as the interesting and indpendent woman she was, is made to look like a clown and behave irrationally. It's an nothing more than a steaming pile of crap.

I've always had a soft spot for Mary Queen of Scots and a huge fan of every book I can get my hands on about her and always felt she was this underdog who gets constantly used in others ambitions but just watching this trailer I'm extremely annoyed. These two women never met, and never in a million years would Mary be caught saying to Elizabeth's face that she is her inferior, because honestly, she wasn't and Mary wasn't that stupid. That would be instant death. And the ACCENT. Mary would not have a scottish accent!!! She lived most of her life in France. And jesus is that accent annoying. These women were not friends, and never met. Yes letters were exchanged, but not like this. And Mary was by no means a strong independent woman, does anyone not remember how she spent her life and all the men involved? She was actually made fun of for being considered a tramp by every country including her own. The writers are once again changing the facts to make a movie with overly powerful women that aren't women anyone can actually understand or root for. Just watching this trailer I'm thinking Mary needs to get her head cut off and quickly for all the sh*t she keeps talking yet can't in a million years with a hundred armies back up.

Elizabeth agreed to name James VI of Scotland as her successor after his birth. Mary agreed to give up her claim to the English throne as long as her son was recognized as the rightful heir.

2019-01-29T23:53:19,"DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM - UNLESS YOU ENJOY FICTION / FANTASY.  I expected some dramatisation - much like the Tudors.  Unlike the Tudors which was broadly based on historical fact, this movie has virtually NO historical fact AT ALL.  In fact, this film should be entitled 'a work of fiction'.  Amongst other things - here is the HUGE list of historic 'errors' this film has:-  1) Elizabeth never named an 'heir' to the throne.  Oddly the film says that she did - she named James, the son of Mary.  Then the film comes up with factual text at the end saying she didn't do that after all.  Confused?  So was I.  Utter nonsense.  2) Elizabeth never met Mary EVER.  Period.  Yet according to this film she did.  er.....  no.  3) At the end of the film (Marys execution) Elizabeth says she'll remember meeting Mary fondly 5 & 20 years ago as a young vibrant queen - not the aged women she had become.   This would make the meeting in 1562 - when Mary actually Mary ran from Scotland in 1567.  3) In the so say 'meeting' (that remember never happens in reality), Elizabeth was portrayed as a rather age worn 40 something, and Mary as a very young 20 something.  This is incorrect, there was only a 9 year age gap between them.    4) James Stewart Earl Of Moray was subservient to Mary not an equal, and they were brought up in different households - the film portrays them as equals.  5) For some obscure reason the filmakers had to insert a gay scene into the film.  Yet they didn't even make it HALF believeable - with the impossibly unlikely pairing of Lord Darnley and David Rizzo!  Then to compound the ludicriousness they have Mary (after finding out Rizzo had slept with her husband) saying basically ""Hey thats ok"".  In reality in the 1500s, any gay relationship would have been against the bible, and he would have been put to death.  And any 'gay relationship' would not have been in a place where people could just 'walk in' - it would be under the viel of secrecy.  6)  Laughably the film shows 'Queen Elizabeth's house' as Hardwick Hall.  Unfortunately there are 2 problems with this.  Though invited on many occasions  Hardwick Hall was the one place Queen Elizabeth NEVER visited!  Oh yes and theres the other 'minor detail' of Hardwick Hall being built between 1590 and 1597, so it was begun 3 years after Mary Queen Of Scots was executed.  Yet Queen Elizabeth was shown there in the '1560s'.    7) There is no evidence Lord Darnley was gay.  He had a male valet - just like every single other nobleman in the country at the time.  But there was zero evidence of him being gay.  In the film he was.  8) Putting black people/other races in the film is a joke.  It is a bit like doing a film about african slavery, or the Zulu wars and sticking the odd white person in there for effect.  If you did that QUITE RIGHTLY black people would be OUTRAGED.  So historians are JUSTIFIABLY outraged at chucking in the odd black person for effect in what was plainly a white court.

2019-01-30T10:30:23,"Mary, Queen of Scots was Queen of Scotland from 1542 to 1567. She was the daughter of King James V of Scotland and his second wife, Mary of Guise, and was the only surviving legitimate child of the king. The untimely death of her father when she was just six days old made her the Queen of Scots as a tiny infant. In the chaos following her father‚Äôs death, Mary‚Äôs great-uncle King Henry VIII of England made an effort to secure control of the throne of Scotland but his attempt was thwarted in a timely manner by Mary‚Äôs mother who acted as a regent on behalf of her daughter. Her mother, who was of French origin, fixed Mary‚Äôs marriage with Francis, the four-year-old heir to the French crown, and sent her to live in France where she was raised in the court of Francis‚Äô father, French King Henry II. She soon married Francis and when her young husband ascended to the throne upon his father‚Äôs death, Mary became the queen consort of France. However, the untimely death of her husband left Mary a widow at the age of 18 and she returned to Scotland. Mary‚Äôs reign as the Queen of Scots was fraught with political difficulties and her unwise personal choices only complicated the issues. Mary was born on 8 December 1542 to the King of Scots, James V, and his French second wife, Mary of Guise. She was the only legitimate surviving child of the king who was on his deathbed at the time of her birth. Mary was baptized at the nearby Church of St Michael shortly after she was born. James V died on 14 December 1542 when Mary was just a few days old. Thus she became the Queen of Scots as an infant. It was decided that Scotland would be ruled by regents until Mary became an adult. When Mary was six months old, she was betrothed to Prince Edward, the son of King Henry VIII of England. However, the engagement was eventually called off due to certain religious and political issues. Since Mary‚Äôs mother was French, she readily agreed when the French king, Henry II proposed that Mary be married to his son, the Dauphin Francis. Following the betrothal, Mary was sent to live in the French court under the care of her father-in-law. Mary and Francis reportedly developed a close bond from the day they met. Mary received a good upbringing in France and was trained in horsemanship, falconry and needlework. She also learned French, Italian, Latin, Spanish, and Greek, and was competent in prose and poetry. She married Francis in 1558. Her father-in-law, Henry II, died in 1559 and her 15 year old husband Francis ascended to the throne as the King Francis II and Mary, at 16, became his queen consort. Francis II died of an ear infection on 5 December 1560 leaving Mary a widow at 18. Francis‚Äô younger brother Charles inherited the throne and Mary returned to Scotland nine months after her husband‚Äôs death. She faced numerous challenges upon her return to Scotland in 1561. Having spent the major part of her early life in France, Mary was unaccustomed to life in Scotland. At that time, Scotland was torn between Catholic and Protestant factions, and Mary‚Äôs illegitimate half-brother, the Earl of Moray, was a leader of the Protestants. Mary, as a devout Catholic, was regarded with suspicion by many of her Protestant subjects, and her tolerance towards Protestants disappointed the Catholics. She fell in love with her English-born first cousin Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley and married him in 1565. This match was considered scandalous by both the Catholic and Protestant factions as Mary and Lord Darnley were first cousins. This marriage also turned her Protestant half-brother against her as Lord Darnley was also a Catholic. The marriage ran into problems from the very beginning as Lord Darnley proved to be a mean and vicious man. In March 1566, Darnley, along with a group of Protestant nobles brutally murdered Mary's Italian secretary, David Rizzio, in front of Mary who was heavily pregnant at that time. Darnley suspected that his wife was having an affair with Rizzio. Following this incidence, Mary‚Äôs marriage with Darnley broke down. When Darnley was found dead under mysterious circumstances in February 1567, murder was suspected, and Mary, along with James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, and the Earl of Morton came under suspicion. Within three months of Darnley‚Äôs death, Mary married the main suspect in her husband's murder‚ÄîJames Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell. This marriage was considered outrageous and the public turned against her. In July 1567, Mary was compelled to abdicate the throne in favor of her infant son. Mary was imprisoned in Lochleven Castle but managed to escape in 1568. She fled to England, seeking protection from her cousin, Elizabeth I. However, Elizabeth was suspicious of Mary‚Äôs intentions and had her imprisoned. Mary‚Äôs first marriage was to Francis II of France which took place in 1558. It is not known whether the marriage was consummated or not as Francis II died very young, at the age of 16. A few years after the death of Francis II, Mary married her first cousin Lord Darnley in 1565. This marriage was problematic from the very beginning though it produced one son, James VI and I. Darnley died under mysterious circumstances in 1567. A few months after the death of Darnley, she married the prime suspect in his alleged murder, James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell. After being imprisoned by Elizabeth I, Mary was kept under strict surveillance. Her imprisonment would last for 19 long years. In 1586, Mary corresponded with Anthony Babington who was plotting to depose Elizabeth. The letters fell into the hands of Elizabeth‚Äôs spymaster Francis Walsingham, and Elizabeth began to see Mary as a threat. Thus Mary was brought to trial, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to death. Mary was executed by beheading in Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire, on 8 February, 1587. She was 44 years old.üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø",0,0,Patrick Woodside,wnqjSgMU36U,0.020016561721107183,2019-01-30 10:30:23,False,True

I know it‚Äôs a film, to be taken with a pinch of salt, but why make a film about an historical figure and get the historical facts wrong?  Mary was at the French court from an early age until aged 18, yet comes to Scotland with a Scottish accent (then again I know people from Scotland who can turn the accent on and off at will).  The film looked beautiful - the music (Handel?) was great but then Elizabeth started speaking with an Australian accent and that sort of killed if for me.
