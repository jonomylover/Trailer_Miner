2017-11-19T00:05:30,"Wow, it looks like¬†Hollywood came up with a refreshingly original concept for once. I hope the movie holds up to the trailer. I almost get a creepypasta vibe from this. The atmosphere is non-generic yet familiar, the implied monster is kept from our sight and is displayed only through a single scene featuring claw marks, and the family can so easily make a mistake that can kill them all off, which creates an heir of suspense and legitimate risk, and thus, a form of pure fear, as opposed to the dime-a-dozen slasher movies. Not to mention the cast looks good, especially with the inclusion of Emily Blunt an Jon Krasinski.

Because moving furniture into a house that you can't make a peep in is just impossible. Also why would anyone wanna purposely live there if they have to be utterly silent? That tells me they had to live there prior to whatever monster there is, or they are in a post apocalyptic world where they found shelter in the country.  2) As others pointed out... how in the world can whatever they're hiding from not see the house or other infrastructure on the property but hear the tiniest whisper? Furthermore how would whatever it is be able to hunt without seeing?  3) I'm assuming they are no where near a beach... so where In the world did he get all that sand from?  4) if you are hiding, why are they outside in the open? The little kid crossed the bridge and the woman was doing laundry which suggests they've established some kinda life there. But still why are you outside??

So in this movie what bothered me is the simple premise that the more you think about has no goddamn sense, the monsters react to the tinyests of sounds, ok, then how the fuck are they not gathered around the watterfall? They grew tired of it? How did that racoon survive that long, or the birds shown at start they have to land sometimes, or the fucking fishes, i mean they attack anything that makes a sound even the tv, so how are they not out there hitting the fucking trees cause the wind is making sound through the leafs, or the house i mean its a fucking wooden house those things make sounds on their own, or the familly when its asleep, what they dont talk in their sleep or fucking snore?and the metod they found out to beat them is idk, like the millitary wouldnt find out earlier, it was even in the fucking news that they react to sound. This movies own rules violate themselves and the more you think about it the less sense they make. I hate when movies with good base stories and so much huge potential do that, couldnt they just make so the monsters react to only living things or only human vocal cords? and there pooofff i fixed the plot holes now just center the story around that, jesus christ is this movie not believable, and i actually hate that cause this movie had great acting pace and a good premise, it could have been so fucking good. Am not gonna say its bad its defo worth a watch in regards to all the shit today that comes out and is entertaining and suspense but god does the logic bother me.

2018-04-22T21:14:25,"( spoilers)This movie was easy money. There was little to no dialogue, which makes sense, but when there WAS dialogue, it was cheesy and cliche. They kept using the same set pieces, so production cost on that was probably saved. The characters had no personality at all, so you even if they died(hypothetically) you wouldn‚Äôt be saddened.  The story had so many unanswered questions ( Where‚Äôd the monsters come from, why they‚Äôre here, what are they, etc.) and the ‚Äúsuspense‚Äù was just predictable scenes of artificial tension; ending with a loud noise.   There were things that made sense (the sand on the pathway, painting the wood to know where to step), and things that did not( why are they staying at the creaky wooden house instead of near the waterfall, why do they have hanged paintings that can fall and make noise, why didn‚Äôt they think of the solution of high-pithed frequency to fight something that relies entirely on sound earlier, WHY WOULD THEY HAVE A BABY THAT WILL CRY LOUDLY THE MOMENT IT‚ÄôS BORN).  Overall, i thought the concept was interesting, but execution was dreadful. There wasn‚Äôt any true suspense that didn‚Äôt feel so forced, no built relationship with the characters, and the ‚Äúlore‚Äù of the movie was essentially non-existent as far as I could tell.  2/10 Only my opinion",0,0,Ascended,p9wE8dyzEJE,-0.013825757575757582,2018-04-22 21:14:25,False,True

It could very well be that the couple are very devout Christians. The film gives us several hints: One: They pray before their meals. Two: they erected a cross for their deceased child and three: the pregnancy itself. If they were devout Christians, they would most likely be against abortion and be pro-life. It could also be that the wife wanted another son after their youngest had died. Either way, they prepared for this by making a soundproof basement, a soundproof cradle complete with an oxygen mask, and an elaborate diversion to detract from her screams during childbirth. There were other religious themes woven into it as well such as self sacrifice and the value of love and family roles. Sooooo... it‚Äôs not to far-fetched when you put it all together.

He leaves the shot gun behind for no reason? 3. They have no front door and no door blocking the downstairs? Why the fuck not? 4. The entire downstairs could be sound proofed yet they stick the baby in a sound proof box? Stupid. 5. The whole hearing aid frequency thing is stupid when she just blows it's head off at the end. They make out it was easier to kill becasue she messed with it's hearing yet they all pause and open their head up to detect prey - head shot FUCKING BOOM! 6. Every single bad thing that happened was a result of the kids not doing what they are told and being fucking retards. 7. The kid could have released the hand brake on the care earlier. 8 The father goes out screaming like a bitch instead of swinging that axe like a man and potentially winning the fight or at least inuring it. Stupid - Again. 9. They relied on fireworks they had to run and light rather than a simpler method to make noise like a long line to the house that set off an alarm etc - they had electricity.... 10. Why not set traps to dissuade them coming in or as early warning in the fields etc? 11. The stupidest thing is again the whole head opening BS. It made the whole rest of the story unbelievable as these things would have been wiped out in short order by gun toting citizens and the police/military.

You see, the plot/concept of the film is quite fascinating, it has a massive potential to become an intense thriller, yet it would be hard to pull off. I've seen bad films with a great plots.   They did more than pull it off. It was so good that it pulled my weave off. The ambience/atmosphere was intense. The build-up of the scenes, camera angles and movements, cinematography and scriptwriting was magnificent! This is stellar quality! My sense of hearing augmented and was compelled. This is how you make a thriller. It thrills all of your senses, makes your heartbeat skip swiftly, drives you to the edge of your seat and could also make you cry and break your heart.   If you haven't seen this, drop everything and watch it! Close the lights, put some earphones on and watch it alone for better and more scintillating experience. That's what I did. And brace yourselves (your heart, most especially) for a one hell of a ride!

He needed to teach his last surviving son on how to survive and instill confidence into him. His daughter is the present day equivalent of an SJW blocking a road, which hypothetically could cause an ambulance not to get to victim. Her rebellious behavior almost ended her entire family. Father knows best, so listen... well in her case watch his hands and read his lips. In honesty, her actions led to her father‚Äôs sacrificial death and towards the end she realized this. It‚Äôs sad, but shit happens and sometimes you can‚Äôt control it. Her cochlear devices her father jimmy rigged were made out of love for and she realizes this.

How did she scream in the bathtub and not die. 2.) The baby made noise and not die. 3.) The mice wasnt making noise but somehow died. 4.) The old man scream but stop. How did it know where he was or kills him. 5.) The kid dying with the airplane noise make sense. The noise never stopped. 6.) Father was quite and monster attacked him from the roof for no reason. 7.) How did no one else shoot and kill these monsters before. 8.) So this blind monster magically miss stepping on the nail the mom stepped on. 9.) Parts where they get stuck and have to get out, places like bathtub and quicksand sort of thing or giving birth. The director choose not to show us how this happens instead the movie jumps to the scene where a baby is already had, she is out the slippery tub. And they are out the quick sand.

I don't often like movies without a clear story, but seeing how they survive against these aliens is really interesting. Though it was a little odd seeing husband and wife in the movie xD  They didn't need to 'act' as partners, cause they are. And you could tell.  They put a lot of emotion in their acting. No wonder Emily Blunt hesitated for a moment wether she would want to enter such a dark story. But darn they're good at their jobs. Regardless of the good acting, the movie wasn't scary to me at all.

The movie wanted to pass a message with every scene - which it does very well (the traumatic experience that hurt a family bond, the parents that tried their best but were overwhelmed by an adverse situation, the kid that didn't understand what was going on and thought she was to blame, plus the awareness of being impaired and probably feeling like a burden, and so on and so forth), and every character is very distinct. But I feel like they tried to address a lot of things at the same time and kinda forgot about the plot (which has abysmal holes to it and ended up a little cliche), and the ending could've been a lot better.
