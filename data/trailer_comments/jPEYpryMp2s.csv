2018-04-09T01:27:13,This may be a rather obvious Question but why does The Force Awakens and Rogue One make some attempt to look like a Star Wars movie in terms of lighting and colour timing.  Yet The Last Jedi strayed a fair bit and this Movie strayed so much in colour timing and lighting that it could be a Tom Cruise's sci fi movie.  What did Ritchy Cunningham do fire the Lighting Director ?. Like people said about Wonder Woman *FIX THE COLOUR TIMING*  The only advantage to it looking like this is for China to better hide that it's a Star Wars movie - by using the bland modern visual filmed in a deep dark hole style.  Also seems a bit humourless in tone too.

Guess we'll find out in May after Jeremy Jahns and Chris Stuckman review it..  Btw, I'm not a Star Wars fanatic, but if you're going to have a film marketed as a ""Star Wars Story"" it might be wise to do more than just fill it with familiar props and hire a director who's an old friend of the creator to replace two weaker directors.   If they still plan on doing an Obi-Wan Kenobi stand-alone film, I really hope they don't go in this direction..

I feel like every character referenced in theses side movies are somehow going to make it into the 9th movie; then it will really be Marvel infinity war. Star wars shouldnt look at what other movies are doing, modern movies are supposed to take from star wars. I didnt really have an opinion about episode 7 i thought it was alright - if not a new hope remake, but then I had to digest the disgrace that was episode 8. As a relatively lazy fan of the star wars universe even I felt as though it was a grevious insult to all the fans that had grown up with star wars and had dived head first into the additional lore.( if you have yet to see episode 8 still, i implore you to stay away from it, in terms of development it was laughable and im certain you’re star wars experience will remain positive)",0,0,Veksler to the Drexler,jPEYpryMp2s,0.09524948735475051,2018-04-09 07:06:54,True,True

And that’s why I’m confused at the negative vibes for Alden??  You can see in this ad his “maturing” the character. He seems young, naive almost vulnerable when he says “I’ve been waiting for a shot like this for a long time” yet when you see him interacting with chewie, throwing the money in the middle etc it’s clearly further on in time and you can feel him showing more arrogance and coolness.  If people get away from wanting to see a “Harrison 2.0” I think he could surprise us with his take on the character??? But biggest thing I’m taking from this is I disagree that the Lando character is set to steal the show.  What has been, 6 movies now for chewie?? This is the first time I’ve felt some depth and character from him rather than just being a prop almost. Seeing him with bit of emotion( possibly with his wife????)comedy from him individually rather than just being part of enhancing Solo’s comedy and/or emotion.

2018-04-09T11:49:09,"This looks like a fun movie - I'm gonna check it out for sure. In my opinion The Last Jedi was pretty great in a lot of ways, I personally loved that it challenged expectations. So far I'm really happy with what Lucasfilm have done and are doing given the crazy pressure they must be under (mostly from so-called fans, to deliver their individual and highly specific vision of what these films and characters should be, oh and those shareholder $$$). A lot of the comments here, and the hate on display, is surprising and not at all what I'd expect from the Star Wars community of fans. It's like the haters haven't actually learned anything from watching the Lucas era films and incorporated any of that into how they conduct themselves as human beings, how sad is that!? It just comes off as puerile entitlement... What I observe when I watch behind the scenes footage (especially after watching the director and the Jedi documentary) is many talented individuals who deeply love Star Wars and are giving their all to honour Lucas' legacy, but also establish a new trajectory. Of course if you really don't enjoy these films, that's perfectly fine. But it's too easy to just sit there and be so damned negative - I assume you are here because you are a Star Wars fan - which means you're better than that.

It's like every one of these new movies that have come out have dangled something from the expanded universe in our faces and then shat on it, rub out faces in it, and then told us to swallow.  When Disney first bought out Star Wars I defended them because I enjoyed what they did with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I had high hopes that they would finally get out of the Empire Era and start making movies about the Old Republic or even before.

2018-04-09T16:06:18,"Disney's Star Wars ""side stories"" are better than their main films because the characters are victims of probable, well-established circumstances and within these circumstances, they struggle to get through. Whereas the main films operate out of geocentricity—Characters are walking deus ex machinas without credible ingenuity or skill, of which the world and all its events revolve around.   Overpowered ≠ Bad Storytelling.  Overpowered characters are completely justified if focus is first attributed to world-building and the Magic Rules that world adheres to. Once the rules are established, characters can ""rampage"" to their heart's desire just as long as they stay within the limitations of the established rules (These are some of the best stories).  The problem of the main films isn't any one specific character but the failure to accurately set up circumstances that are believable irrespective to the ""A-team"" as well as failure to at least hint at lore rules before a feat is performed.",0,0,Eriick Brown,jPEYpryMp2s,0.1627450980392157,2018-04-09 16:06:18,True,True

Yeah it's expanding off of a character we already know and love, but at least it's a fresh take. They won't have to sit and reference the OT just to please fans.

2018-05-18T12:17:33,"Carrie, Mark and Harrison didn't have much experience before episode IV and look how that turned out. Alden is good actor, but not for this part. Only reason he got it is because Spielberg lobbied him and then Kathleen forced the original directors to cast him.  You can teel how Lord and Miller were forced to lie to look like they were one to chose Alden and when they got fed up of Kathleen trying to do their job they just quit. This is problem in many of the mainstream movies today --- producers are acting like directors or they just hire uncreative puppies like Johnson and Abrams who will do everything they say. Reason why the Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars movie is because Kershner made it it's own movie.  Even then, Lucas who was just story supervisor and producer of the movie tried to mesh up with Kershners work but he had the balls to put him in his place lol.

Even Last Jedi, which everyone hated, did better with its trailers.  Second of all, I know I might be nitpicking, but I don't like the style of the title shown here. Seriously, it's like, large, chunky, spinning letters. It looks more kiddish than even the logo of Star Wars's kid-focused show, Star Wars Rebels. Even from the title, I'm worried about the style and mood they're going for.  Lastly, reviews have already come in, with scores placing in the low 70-60s. That's basically a C-F tier. So, yeah.

Now that Last Jedi has come to pass and the Skywalker era is over, instead of fighting over what happened and how it happened we should instead look forward and really think about what do we want from this franchise. Do we want it to die? live another day? what do we want exactly. I seems that Disney has no idea about what fans want and they just create the stories they want the way they want them with political messages and all of that,  instead of listening to the fans.

But it's technically neither part of the Prequel Trilogy or the Original Trilogy. So in a sense, this is some sort of Mid-quel, if you will. But if you think about it, since the Original Trilogy is now sandwiched between the Prequel Trilogy and the Sequel Trilogy, then really that should be considered the ""Mid-quels"". That means The Prequel Trilogy is the prequel to the ""Mid-quel"" Trilogy. Likewise, the ""Mid-quel"" Trilogy is the sequel to the Prequel Trilogy. But now we have a problem. If the Original Trilogy is the ""Mid-quel"" Trilogy, then The Star Wars Story Saga cannot be the ""Mid-quel"" Trilogy anymore. So if the Star Wars Story Saga is not a ""Mid-quel"" Saga, but it is still a sequel to the Prequel Trilogy, then in my crazy Trilogy fantasizing, they must be something in between.

And for all of the fanboys that can't handle the fact that some people love different content, welcome to reality.  The Last Jedi went very different than a lot of people including Mark Hamill expected.  That's life.  Unexpected things happened and that's what made The Last Jedi so real.  In regards to Solo, all you whiners out there who boycotted it for the stupidest reasons ever, you just missed out on the best 2 hours and 15 minutes of your lives.  Thanks for perhaps ruining what could have been one of the greatest trilogies Star Wars could have gotten.  Solo was a masterpiece and I hope that people realize that because I need sequels!

It's just a mis-mash of images that again, tells you nothing.  Back in the day (long ago before the force was invented) movie trailers use to tell you what the movie is about, used to tell you the villain's and how they want to rule the world and that the hero was the only one to stop him/her.

Everyone go see it in the theaters now while you can because it is the best Star Wars since Empire, or at least since Disney took over (and also Rogue One which was a very cool movie...but this one actually felt like a Star Wars and not as dark as Rogue One).  I actually heard one critic say that Last Jedi was the best Star Wars since Empire, and that's just insane to me. We all know that the first two were just a reboot of the originals for modern times. How critics won't admit that is beyond me.  They are hyping up the sequels for some reason, which helps them gross more, and bashing the spin-offs.  As for the Force Awakens and Last Jedi, they were directed, casted and filmed flawlessly, but the plot took no chances and it was just the same ol story. Did anyone even stop to ask how all a sudden the Empire is back untouched and fully restored after they were completely defeated at the end of the original saga (Return of the Jedi)?  Solo was refreshing for several reasons. First off, the story line takes the risk and doesn't just mimic the original plots. It's refreshing, creative and goes off in it's own direction. The casting was spot on for every role. Hans was perfect, Lando was awesome, and all the others as well...great on-screen chemistry. The visuals and directing were all fantastic as is no surprise for Disney and Ron Howard.  So far in my opinion, the only real successful Star Wars since Disney were Rogue One and Solo because it feels like we're watching something new and not just a modern version of the originals.

The first act was not great but it picks up and gets better as it progresses. The editing/story feels a little too fast paced at times and it would've been cool to see more depth built into some of the characters but I enjoyed it overall (especially after the trainwreck of The Last Jedi).
