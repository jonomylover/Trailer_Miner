2014-06-17T21:55:53,I liked I and II this ones looks better. Adding Mel Gibson cool move. I hope Jet Li has some good fight scenes. I thought his fight scene was the best one in Expendables II but all of them were great.  In my opinion this will be the best movie of the year. For one expendables has good action. Most newer movies have really lousy action scenes or else some 90 pound anorexic girl beating every one up (yawn). The action in these movies can stand on their own even if the actors were nobodies. But then you have the added cool factor of all the old actors some of us grew up watching. Then on top of it the story lines aren't too bad for an action movie.,1,0,Raymond Kidwell,sTte6BQndTQ,0.36315789473684196,2014-06-17 21:55:53,True,True

I like Van Damme but Gibson is gonna kick ass as Conrad Stonebanks. I really wanted Seagal. Seagal is still being an awkward prick and refusing to take a role because of a falling out between him and the crew. This would have been great for Steven. Seagal should lose the weight, stop being a dickhead and agree to star in one of these brain-dead sequels. I like the addition of Robert Davi. Davi is a great actor and deserves to be seen on the big screen again. I have a feeling Davi is going to be on Gibson's side. Not keen on Kelsey Grammer and Banderas.

He didn't have enough screen time, and didn't really do anything so bad that he must be completely destroyed (unless you count him shooting down Terry Crews... twice). Like the first villain was drug dealing, and had his own evil military attacking citizens. The second killed an Expendable, and tried to steal nukes. But this guy he literally does nothing, but gloat, and lure Barney into his den. Like seriously the last battle was AWESOME and everything, but the bad guy just sucked. There was nothing really all that memorable that he did that was so dang evil all The Expendables must kill him.

Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill... or so he thought. Stonebanks, who eluded death once before, now is making it his mission to end The Expendables -- but Barney has other plans. Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy.
