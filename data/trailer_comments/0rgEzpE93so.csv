Is she supposed to be the hero? How naive one must be to think that so much awfulness should be redeemed by a suicide and a lifelong guilt trip. Firstly, i am talking about the main characters apparent nobility, who is an angel in comparison to her friends, and secondly, the victim in all of it ends up getting it worst of all, who has to live with its complete absurdity in any case.  What a truly morally skewed viewpoint this film portrays. I suppose the victim in this won't stop for a moment to think about being so wrong about someone who ridiculed her throughout her school life, wouldn't be even more messed up by that, wouldn't feel guilty for being affected by all that ridicule, and wouldn't feel even more worthless than she was already made feel? I mean Jesus, everyone is her friend, especially those that hate her. I can't find a clue! Perhaps she will get lucky and get to live long enough to enjoy the presumed demise of the other girls, and find solice in the same spite that makes her stand so tall to find a fruitful, productive and fulfilling role as one who turns the table on people who are nasty. I mean, f*** me, it might have been more humane to commit the girl to a mental institution with some hope of someone *actually* giving a sh!t.  What a fairyland fairytale fantasy film! Are you serious!? Who on any versions of Earth was this film made for?
