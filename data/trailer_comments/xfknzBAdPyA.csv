Kong strikes some King-like poses and says 'Hey you little people, get off my lawn'.  The End?  Overall I am getting a better feel for Kong: Skull Island and it might be pretty good.  Would like more Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, less Samuel L. Jackson and John Goodman (just because I'm pretty sure their characters are what you see in the trailers) and more of the Giant Yak.  I mean, c'mon.  A Giant Yak?  You've got steak houses already flying to the location shoot to see if they can find evidence that Giant Burger/Steak factories do walk the earth.
