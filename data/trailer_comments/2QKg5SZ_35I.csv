The only pain i can expect is being forced to watch a committee-made movie designed to elicit a response which has already surpassed its purposes, to realise this is a movie (like so many from hollywood) made solely to earn a profit for the machine - however, being fed the earnest respect and love for the original film and the material its based on, the unique cast and their rapport will serve some as well intentioned, I'll try to be convinced this is new entertainment for a new generation.

I'm not saying this is going to be a great or amazing movie, just that it doesn't look like the complete loss I feared. Looks like it will be a fun popcorn flick.  The major difference I see is that in the original, part of the intensity was that the game invaded your world. Altered what was familiar and safe for the player and made it dangerous and unknown. That really amped up the danger and sense of impending doom. With this, they are pulled into the world and they know it is a video game. I'm wondering if the filmmakers will be able to convey the same sense of real danger. Or actually, if that even matters to the film at all.

One of my main worries is that from this trailer, I feel it may be missing the emotional sincerity that the original had, the depth and dare to be 'cheesy' and still pull it off. Perhaps that was a by product of the times and type of direction of the original, or maybe they're just hiding that in this trailer so as to not give it all away.

I dont like that it has the name Jumangi attached to the title because it really not similar, its more like a spiritual sequel like Zathura, even that movie was more similar to the original. Another thing I dont like is that like the original and Zathura, the main cast consisted of children/teens and it seemed to work better that way, I dont like that Hollywood decided to put grown adults as the main cast as it totally ruined the essence of the Jumangi game. With children you could think ""what will their next move be?"" like Home Alone kind of, but with an adult cast that thought in me will be lost (even though I know they are just avatars of the kids, its not the same to me).

The issue lies with the fact it takes away all the aspects of the original. Most notably tone. Even with all the changes made, this could have been a salvageable plot of going into the game. But you can't turn it into a Kevin Hart/Jack Black comedy.   What we're gonna get is Kevin Hart short jokes and about a dozen ""Ew Elephant Poop! Haha!"" comedy. Also most notably. Why is it a video game? If it was because ""video games are more popular"" that's just stupid cause it's still an Atari they find, not a PS4. And while people still play Board games regularly...people don't play Atari. Also let's also note the game's menu screen has modern HD graphics yet it's on an Atari.   The premise can still work with them getting sucked into the board game...so there is literally no reason to make it a video game. I wanted to like this movie.

Yeah it has  its fair share of cliches and the trailer doesn't do much to separate it from most blockbusters nowadays, but it doesn't look horrendous. Having the actors portray characters that are very different from who they are personally is an interesting fish-out-of-water concept and can lead to some funny results. It won't be fantastic but it will be passable.   SO DON'T COMPARE THIS TO THE ORIGINAL JUMANJI!

I can see why they did this, as how many kids actually play board games these days? 2. Children become their in game avatars - again I can see the reasoning.  While I know some guys like playing as a hot chick, I'm not sure if the girls do this in reverse - but what the heck - we get Jack Black so who's complaining. 3. For me the original was as much about Alan and Sarah as it was about the children, there's nothing in the trailer to suggest that element in this film, of course the trailer s cut from all the action pieces that they hope will get people to go and watch the film, so there may be things we're missing here.  To me this looks like something that's not going to be enjoyable.

2017-06-29T23:37:22,"I hate this, ( small rant why ) people in the future are going to think this was the original movie, even though it wasn't. it gets rid of the fact that the game was a BOARD game not a video game. it changes the entire subject from this point on. the original movie was about a boy who found this game, got put in the jungle for a while until two kids found it and played the game, setting him, and a bunch of other caos free. now in this movie it's more of a comedy/ action movie and what not. if they want a GOOD movie what I think they should do is that, that at the end of the original movie, the game washes up on some island and the last thing you see is two native kids say ""oh do you here that?"" while loud drums are playing zooming in on the game. they  should continue this movie from that point. but knowing they can't because one of the famous actors has killed themselves  ( unknowingly if it WOULD help the plot anyway ) this movie in a way, is getting rid ot the original in place of this. or here's another idea do a ""remake"" I'm pretty sure alot of people rather see a remake of original than see ""this""  because it's just getting rid the entire meaning of ( again ) original movie.

But The Rock is the GOAT and Kevin Hart is hilarious, and regardless of nostalgia, it does look like it has a lot of entertainment value. I am looking for some good writing for the comedy, and good cinematography for the action scenes for this to be a real home run. The main reason why I am being lenient is because I am not expecting it to be faithful to the original because of three reasons:  1. It needs to be either 100% modern or 100% classic, no half assed in the middle  2. I haven't seen Jumanji in years and I can barely remember it. TBH, I didn't even know that Robin Williams was in it, that's how long it's been. I feel like lots of people are in the same boat as me, yet will still see the movie anyway  3.

The Last Guardian and Uncharted 4 posters in that kids room. They seem way too calm about Jack Black getting eaten by a hippo.  Since its a game does he just spawn back in?

It became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing it's credibility, which eventually, of course, it did.

2017-06-30T08:50:27,"The original Jumanji was about facing fear and growing up. The board game serves as a gateway to a mysterious jungle which is a metaphor for adulthood. The original movie was very good at conveying the fear the Robin Willliams character feels for adulthood through the archaic trappings of an ornate board game that looks like a relic from an older time; this also deepened the mystery that hooks the viewer. That fear is echoed in the younger 90s male character for whom Robin Williams serves as guide. The movie was also good at framing the journey into maturation as an adventure about the intrusion of the unknown into the familiar; closure came through the deepened understanding of the borders between the worlds of adulthood and childhood, and eventually enabled the characters to close the gateways to fear. The only gripe about that movie that I would have liked to see addressed in a sequel/reboot or whatever is the development of the female characters. I won't watch this, but I don't hold it against anyone who does. I just hope that at some point someone really does a sequel to Jumanji that expands on what was good about the original.

This looks like a group of celebrities romping through the forest as stock characters they've been before, grasping for some form of comedic dialogue.  What matters in Jumanji is that the game is REALLY effecting the world around the characters, and we care so much about Alan Parrish's story because he himself ACTUALLY gets sucked into a jungle for several years, a jungle that then begins forcing itself upon his hometown while expressing poetic riddles.  If even a hippopotamus attack is played for ""laughs"" in this Gun N' Roses adaptation, there seems to be no true danger or suspense.  The original puts us on the edge of our seats even as each stone carved piece ...somehow!?.. moves across the board. Why should we care about video game avatars when the characters don't seem to?  So MUCH can still be done with the board game to make it fresh and powerful in different ways. I would say that I'm going to miss the evocative power of a spooky game that lures people into digging itself up with an ethereal drum circle's heart beat, but I'll probably just watch the 1995 award winning hit Jumanji and skip whatever this is supposed to be.",1,0,Daniel Hudson,2QKg5SZ_35I,0.04970238095238096,2017-06-30 09:07:01,True,True

From the intriguing board game that captured your imagination, to the thrilling sense of danger in the set pieces, the humor, the sense of horror, the acting and amazing cast, the subtle yet poignant message at the end, and of course Robin Williams. The ONLY thing these two have in common is the name (aside from the newer film's caption).

2017-06-30T15:57:39,"I genuinely cannot believe the reactions this is getting.   Fine, I understand that you guys don't like how your seemingly favourite movie from when you were a kid, Jumanji, has its name being used in an unrelated premise. However, that being said, this isn't completely far off from the Jumanji source material.   Unlike most people, my exposure to jumanji was from the TV show where the kids would get sucked into Jumanji - a jungle - where they would embark on a new adventure with a stuck Alan every episode. This is completely in line with the concept being shown here with the exception of the avatars. However, in the tv show, peter was sometimes turned into an animal, so take that as it is. This movie seems to be taking the concept introduced in the TV show and putting a modern spin on it by turning it into a video game.   Yes, using Jumanji to do this instead of making a standalone movie with the same premise was absolutely not necessary, but they probably owned the rights to this franchise and wanted to make more money. Movie studios being businesses, you should understand why they did it. Now, with that out of the way, do you still dislike the movie for what it is outside of Jumanji?   This trailer gives the vibe of a super fun movie! The cast is a good one for a comedy action film and the premise is decent. Why can't you see the movie for what it is/has the potential to be instead of grumbling about the usage of the Jumanji name. Like I pointed out, it's not /completely/ out of place using the Jumanji name and the trailer shows real promise.  I'm not entirely sure why I wrote this  whole out lol, but I just felt this movie needed to be cut a bit more slack considering how fun this looked to me.",0,0,tdkr,2QKg5SZ_35I,0.22408459595959596,2017-06-30 15:57:39,True,True

2017-06-30T16:16:19,"Somebody said, ""These movies don't ruin your childhood memories.  They just introduce a new generation to what you had as a kid.  See, if they watch these movies, they'' want to see the old ones too.""  So I started thinking about it.  It is true, no matter how terrible remakes are, they can't really replace the old ones.  So that's not the problem.  It's a stilly argument in the day and age of massive streaming sites to claim that we're introducing an old movie by way of a crappy remake, when you could just...  Watch the original.  So that holds no weight, either.  And as for originality in movies, when we actually get originality it doesn't do so well...  True originality takes movies in new directions, directions that make simple-minded masses feel stupid, so they don't want to watch them.  So that's not going to work either.  But I finally figured out why GHOSTBUSTERS pisses me (and perhaps you, and perhaps everyone pissed off at this trailer) makes me so irritated.  It has nothing to do with the quality of this movie.  It has to do with THEFT.  The only way you can make a semi-okay remake of JUMANJI is if JUMANJI: 1.  Existed in the first place, planting the memory of it in our minds, and  2.  Was enough of a success for the mindless masses to remember it as well as those of us who ACTUALLY remember it, with fondness. We're angry because they're taking the original idea, and shitting all over it.  We're angry because they're taking something we enjoyed, and using it to rake in fake money, fake profits not based on the quality of the remake, but based on the suckering of the masses.  They don't have to make a good movie, and they know it, so why should they bother?  They're not doing this to improve an old idea, or ""introduce it to a new generation"" -- they're trying to cash in on our collective stupidity.    And the saddest part, my friends -- IT'S WORKING.  If the trailer makes you sick (like the FLATLINERS trailer looks to me as well) all you have to do is stand up to the fools that comment ""you don't know if it will be bad if you haven't seen it"".  ""It could be just as good as the original, or even better!""  ""You should give it a chance.""  You should give it a chance...  Where have I heard that nonsense before...?

Be honest people, what teen in high school now a days would look at a board game and say ""hey a cool board game, we have to play this!!"" Vs ""hey a retro game system, I wonder what nostalgic game it plays?"" The board game suited the nineties because it was an ancient way to play. For this generation the old way to play games is game systems. I see it as the curse saw that kids weren't playing with a board game so it transformed into something more appealing and decided to pull the players in versus letting whatever was inside out.

2017-06-30T18:01:55,"This looks like it'll be a decent enough action movie with some comedy elements, but getting sucked into a video game gives more of a Spy Kids vibe than a Jumanji one. Now, they don't necessarily NEED a board game to make a Jumanji sequel work, but using a video game just seems off. Jumanji was about a game coming to life and invading the real world, not kids getting sucked into a video game and trying to get out. The latter idea has been used to the point of almost being cliche, but the former is a large part of what made Jumanji stand out. The distinction is subtle but has a big impact on the severity of the events that unfold in the story. Again I will say that it seems like it could be a pretty enjoyable movie if it's taken as a standalone experience with no association to the Jumanji brand. The problem is...they USED the Jumanji brand, so comparisons are going to abound. In fact, it seems like ""just another action comedy movie"" that is attempting to ride the coattails of a classic film, which is never a good impression to give off to your audience. In the end it will most likely annoy long time fans, NOT because of the movie itself, but rather because the sequel to a beloved and creative classic film is going to most likely be a by-the-numbers, okay action movie.",0,0,Ganonmustdie2,2QKg5SZ_35I,0.07841781874039938,2017-06-30 18:01:55,True,True

Those of you trying to compare this to Ghostbusters......STOP. Here's the difference. This is a continuation of the story bringing new ideas and NOT trying to do what the original did. Ghostbusters was literally a flat out reboot. This actually shows us what's inside the jungle and also bring new and clever ideas like the game being a old video game. But yes, this doesn't come without it's flaws. So far from what I've seen I was hoping for that kinda creepy or little bit more adventurous tone the original had. I remember the beginning freaking me out when I was young, getting sucked into a game. While there's stuff like that in this new version I don't see, I will still give this a chance.

I think the key to a good remake isn't to re-do the movie shot for shot with the same actors, et cetera. What's the point of that? Just go watch the original if that's what you're after. I think a good remake needs to take the good ideas and themes from the original ( a dusty old game with magic powers that brings the jungle to the players and also brings the players into the game), and uses those ideas as a starting point for new ideas, new stories, new characters.  The ORIGINAL Mummy movie and the Brendan Fraiser Mummy are nothing alike, but people love both for different reasons. The ""remake"" of the Brendan Fraiser Mummy tries too hard to BE the Brendan Fraiser Mummy, and it really falls flat as a result. The 2016 Ghostbusters was trying too hard to be the ""new"" ghostbusters movie, rather than be a separate ghost busters movie that doesn't try to tread over the original.

The original Jumanji will always be there.  I plan to actually see this before I whine, complain, and knock the movie. And unlike the uncivilized heathens that got so insulted over the Ghost Busters remake(which actually was funny and entertaining), I don't plan to insult and bully the actors if I don't like it.  P.S. If you don't like the idea of the Jumanji remake, buy dvd's/bluerays of the original. Stream it on netflix. Show you still love the old one. After that, you can either see the new movie and then decide if you don't like it.

The story line must be memorable and picture perfect, and the cast members are scrutinized carefully to accurately illustrate the characters in the plot. Once that standard has been met, the film is then lifted to the heightened status of becoming a ""classic"" and all of the producers and actors are congratulated and awarded for such an amazing and historical project. Everyone goes home and celebrates their accomplishment as their name and film goes down in history. Remakes on the other hand lack all of these characteristics. Remake films remind me of fast food. They are only in it for the profit and care less about quality.

Now it's going to be 4 strangers get sucked into another world and have to work together get out (Fant4stic much?). I honestly think it's cliched. If they wanted for it to sell to younger children, then they could've still made the board game but have it in a 2017 context (Nobody even uses brick video game systems anymore either. Could've been a mobile phone game or whatever people play on these days). This honestly looks like a reverse Pixels. Also the lines, ""You pick a character, and you're that person in the game"" ""I think we got sucked into Jumanji...""

Another issue I have is the casting; It's awful. The two nerdy white kids get to be smoking hot. And the mean girl is fat shamed, and stripped of her femininity. And the black kid is still black, only shorter.  This has to stop. It's not about lack of creativity anymore. Filmmakers are very creative. It's about presentation and representation.

I like the premise of this film, it plays off the idea of movie character stereotypes while also evolving the idea of what Jumanji can be. Unlike the Ghostbusters rehash which just took the original film and swapped the cast with women, masquerading as progressive filmmaking, all with a hint of sexist overtone. I like this trailer, I think it's new, it's a cool idea and it transitions the concept of a game in which you are trapped to a new generation. If this film turns out to be good (which I hope it does) then great, but if not, we still have the original.

Sarah Whittle: getting involved into playing Jumanji by Alan and being the only person to seeing him get sucked into the game and all the unbelivable things that it did. on the night of Alan's dissapearence no one believed her. they made her go through mental ivaluation to see if she is crazy. she's the only one that knew what happen to alan but it made her go crazy that no one believed her. Peter and Judy Shepherd: dealing witht he lost of there parents. Judy was sarcastic and rebelious while Peter became distant and silent never to speak to anyone.  The game brought all of them together to deal with there there issues and to finally get over them. yeah its a comedy but its also has some sierious dramatic issues involved. thats what makes the original Jumanji fantastic. its wasint just stupid one liners and brain dead comedy.,0,0,Zylo82,2QKg5SZ_35I,-0.17445652173913045,2017-07-02 01:28:17,True,True

2017-07-02T09:01:41,"First of all, I have to give props to the filmmakers for taking the concept of Jumanji, updating it, and taking it into a new direction. I like the idea that it doesn't try to capture the spirit of the old movie, mainly because, well, it's been done.   Granted, I miss the emotional and serious tone of the original. This movie seems like it's aiming for comedy and action, but with that said, it does seem like they've gotten a fairly likable cast to give it all a fair degree of charm. I like the idea of teenagers turned into the equivalents of Cluedo characters that are mismatched with their actual personalities, I like the idea of rather than just bringing Jumanji to them, they're brought to Jumanji, and I really like that it kind of begins like a Cabin in the Woods storyline, with teenagers finding the game in the cellar.  Only real issue I have is this: Why did it have to be teenagers? Why is it ALWAYS teenagers? They're at a school, why didn't they use actual kids for main characters for once?

2017-07-02T12:27:55,"I like the Rock but I like him as a person, I don't really get excited for any of his movies, I like Jack Black too and he's made some ace stuff but what has he done recently that has been noteworthy? Kevin Hart is like a black Will Ferrell to some extent, he is shorter but still loves making manic and loud noises whilst screaming, and therefore i'm not really into him and still don't understand the hype around him. Then there's Karen Gillan, she's pretty decent but not like outstanding, haven't seen her in as much stuff recently other than GOTG, which she is arite in I guess (enjoyed her in Doctor Who) but then again seeing her in this role just looks meh. The film could be funny but at the same time it also looks very, very underwhelming and has lost its charm that the original had by modernising it so much that it will probably be cringey.   TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THOUGH...  What I really wanna see is a hard R rated Jumanji, where people get fucked up and it acts almost like a horror movie. I watched the original again recently and it was genuinely a bit scary at times with enough lightheartedness to it to (I guess) make it a childrens film. Obviously make it a Horror Comedy like Evil Dead 2 because the premise is a little too ridiculous to take seriously but you could get some genuine good scares in. Did no one else find the beating drums a bit eerie and creepy when they got played in the original? Imagine some sort of creature or plant monster stalking them whilst that music was playing, it would be waaaaaaaaay intense. Then imagine the total grizzly deaths by some of the creatures in the film.  Just an idea that no one will probably read or like because I wasn't super positive about The Rock, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and I guess Karen Gillan (3 of whom I actually like) but oh well, just throwing it out there (:",0,0,Sammy Palmer,2QKg5SZ_35I,0.04582816804407714,2017-07-02 12:27:55,True,True

It doesn't seem like they are staying true to the original and that is throwing me off a bit.

2017-07-02T13:41:21,"Hey, okay.  This is obviously far from a remake.  If you tweaked it a bit you could actually sell an original movie and not ruin a classic movie your target audience loved as kids.  I'm sure it's just called ""Jumanji"" for sales.  It's only loosely based on the movie and game.    I really wish this was its own movie.  Then it would actually have a chance of becoming a classic.  Hey!  Are you listening?!  We're tired of remakes, live action remakes, sequels, and more Transformers movies!  Have you noticed original stand alone movies get more awards and more revenue?  This is obviously a high budget film, it could have gone far if you didn't reboot a classic.",0,0,Leo Spencer without a scooter,2QKg5SZ_35I,0.22552762237762242,2017-07-02 13:41:21,True,True

A probably explanation is that some kids played the game in the 90s and destroyed it after completing it. Once they destroyed it, the spirit or whatever in the video game was transferred to the nearby video game console. However, this doesn't explain how the game suddenly created 4 different characters with different personalities.This to me is just an excuse to have Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart in the same film (again), while keeping the whole ""kids playing the game"" aspect. To me, this is just an obvious cash grab film.

WHERE DID THE MOTORCYCLES COME FROM?! personally I think it would have been better if they focused on the jungle and characters. using the original movie as a example. when the main character (Robin Williams) gets stuck in the board, leaving him in the jungle until another player rolled a 5 or 8 but when he is released he never actually says what he had to live with only saying it a living nightmare. therefore if they focused on just survival and growth and not MOTORCYCLES IN THE JUNGLE I think it would have actually worked",0,0,riddleman4,2QKg5SZ_35I,0.11818722943722944,2017-07-03 16:23:04,True,True

2017-07-03T17:15:52,"I think if they absolutely wanted to do another Jumanji movie, they should have done a sequel rather than what I assume is a reboot. This doesn't seem to be anything like the Robin Williams one, and while I hate it when a studio is trying to cash in on childhood nostalgia, this just seem not to try at all as the only thing the two movies really seem to have in common is the title.  I don't know why Sony has made it their mission to make flatter versions of classic movies, as one would have thought they would learn something after the 2016 Ghostbusters. While I've personally always wanted to see the world within the game explored, this doesn't do it for me at all as it seems to lack the feeling of the original product, which had a very bittersweet tone and likable characters with depth.  The game isn't even done right. Why couldn't they just bring back the board game from the original and call it a sequel? Is it because Sony thought that children were too stupid to find interest in a movie about a magic board games? Because I think is.  Jack Black, Kevin Hart and the Rock are all very intertaining actors, but they only seem to be in this to bring their fanbases to cinemas rather than bringing something unique to this and building on the story.  Overall, this story doesn't even need to be called Jumanji or associated with that franchise as it obviously doesn't seem to have anything in common with the Robin Williams movie. Actually, you could slap a Jurassic Park, King Kong or The Breakfast club title on this movie and it would seem more faithful to those movies than this.",0,0,thomas jeppesen,2QKg5SZ_35I,0.011507936507936509,2017-07-03 17:15:52,True,True

The reason why there is so many dislikes is because people are saying that this ruins the Jumanji Classic with Robin Williams and made the series into a comedy movie. 2. Sony is probably promoting their stuff aka Uncharted 4 poster. I don't think they are though, I believe it's just part of the movie. 3. Yes that's Nick Jonas flying the helicopter. His name is in the description and 4. The Main cast list is amazing. When I found out that Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan are going to be in this movie I was like ""I'm watching this trailer, I don't care how long I have to wait I am watching the trailer to this movie"" The Rock is great especially in Fast and Furious. Even though he is in a lot of trailers now. Kevin Hart to me is funny and a great comedian. Jack Black has returned. Even though I have only watched him in School of Rock and Karen Gillan has 2 points. 1: She is from where I am from, Scotland and 2: To me she is one of a few rising stars in acting today just like how Kylian Mbappe is the current rising star in football (Soccer) at the moment.

2017-07-05T17:04:07,"The structure of the original film was so clever, with their rolling of the dice on a board game affecting their actual world, and providing a means of well thought out pacing, and story development. In that regard, it can at least be said, that this movie is not a total rip-off.  Hollywood has never been universally creative, but ever since stealing movies and music became not only easy, but acceptable, no effort has been put into either medium. ""Kids won't understand what a boardgame is today, better make it a videogame.""  Well, the kids in the first film weren't exactly fans of board games either,  that allowed for development of a more nuanced plot (which the original film didn't have to begin with. It wasn't even that great of a movie, but this preview makes it look brilliant by comparison.)   These characters are all the same one-dimensional high school stereotypes we've seen in every other crappy film. The industry is just snapping up franchises, and applying the aesthetics of the former to the same characters, and the same story as every other pile of bile that gets regurgitated out of the collective Hollywood gut, hoping that something will stick.

Jumanji is not Oculus Rift.  There is no tension, no fear, no terror, no horror in this remake. It's just a has been and a bunch of never was hamming in front of a green screen displaying a boring shooter video game.  The characters are too old to seem endangered, and their even older avatars only make it worse. They're not even friends, let alone family, so there is no possibility of dramatic tension. They aren't even really characters, as they have no unique personality, they are just bare archetypes (the popular girl, the unpopular girl, the black boy, the Jewish boy).  The plot can be seen a kilometer away! They will fail and fail and whine and whine until they realise they each have a video game superskill. They will use their superskills badly, barely managing to survive, until the ""last battle"" where they finally learn to use them competently. Once back in reality, they will find that the video game ""skill"" they learned helps them in real life.  I predict this film will be just a string of loud explosions and flashing lights, occasionally broken by infantile dialog posing as ""jokes"".

The villain doesn't have much to offer into the films story and when he does crop up it's nothing too thrilling. For a Jumanji sequel, it felt more like a cross between Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones. It felt as if the movie wasn't sure wether it wanted to be a comedy or an action and due to this fell short in some areas, leaving it feeling flat at times. As much as I like the rock I grew tired of the self admiration he had towards his own character at times throughout the movie.

Flinch finds a game and they alll choose an avatar and gets stuck in it. Each person has strengths and weaknesses they have three lines on their arm which represents their life. A character from the game picks them up with a car and explains the rules that jumanji is in danger and only way to escape is by returning the jaguars jewel which he miraculously had. Before getting to the jaguars statue they must go through levels and they get a map to help them. A piece is missing so they look for it but instead of a paper the missing piece was Nick Jonas or Alex as he is the fifth player. He doesn't realise he's been stuck there for 20 years as they return they are faced challenges by the guy who took the jaguars stone.

But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to the store to get some. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quite happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer.

2017-12-23T16:18:22,"I’ll admit, I was extremely skeptical about this movie as well, but after seeing it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I’ll do a quick rundown of the difference on the scenarios and why they are like that (I won’t spoil anything that doesn’t happen within the first 10 minutes). It starts in 1996 when a father brings his teenage son after finding it buried, (presumably after the events of the original), when the son looks at it but doesn’t play it on account it is a board game to play video games instead, the game changes its form overnight to suit his desires, then he plays and gets sucked in like the original, the key difference in this is that when other people later find it, instead of them sucking the game into their world, it sucks them into it. Yes it does use video game logic and it makes up some of the best scenes in the movie, all and all it was actually incredibly entertaining, and doesn’t discredit the original in my opinion.",0,0,Cold Fusion,2QKg5SZ_35I,0.06574074074074072,2017-12-23 16:18:22,False,True

2017-12-29T06:16:52,"I get that they changed Jumanji into a video game for the newer generation and because no one would play board games in modern times  But let's be real - bringing back the board game concept would have worked since Jumanji is a not so normal board game that produces sound when kids are near it. Modern day us would have not ignored it. There you start with a group of kids, some find the board game and thinks it would be boring, and a curious kid will try to play it. The pieces then stick to the board, other kids will think it's some sort of modern contraption, and will continue to play. They will think maybe the creatures coming out is a hologram until the game proves them wrong. And I thought this all up in just 5 mins. There are other creative ways to make the board game work. What about a family trip? Maybe they were camping, so no wifi. Maybe it was Thanksgiving, and an Aunt insisted on playing a board game she found in an antique shop.  I understand this is a remake but the concept of Jumanji being a board game is unique to itself, that is why a lot of people loved it. I just wish they retained it.",1,2,Sacchan 00,2QKg5SZ_35I,-0.069,2017-12-29 06:16:52,False,True

Ο έμπειρος παίχτης Spencer γίνεται ένας μυώδης τυχοδιώκτης, ο αθλητής Fridge χάνει το μισό του ύψος αλλά γίνεται Αϊνστάιν, η δημοφιλής Bethany μεταμορφώνεται σε έναν μεσήλικα καθηγητή και η ντροπαλή Martha είναι μια σκληροτράχηλη πολεμίστρια. Αυτό που ανακαλύπτουν είναι ότι το Jumanji δεν είναι απλώς ένα παιχνίδι -πρέπει πραγματικά να επιβιώσεις. Για να κερδίσουν και να επιστρέψουν στον πραγματικό κόσμο, πρέπει να ζήσουν την πιο επικίνδυνη περιπέτεια της ζωής τους, να ανακαλύψουν τι άφησε πίσω του ο Alan Parrish πριν από είκοσι χρόνια και να μάθουν να παίζουν όλοι μαζί  παρέα, χρησιμοποιώντας τα δυνατά στοιχεία του καθένα.
