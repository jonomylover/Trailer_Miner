2017-10-23T01:38:01,"UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE NORCAL FIRES  This ‚Äúseed-killing‚Äù hypothesis was recently derived from listening to Terry Brown on the Wynn Free program, BBS Radio. I‚Äôve followed and cross checked Terry‚Äôs Elohim channeling for several years. She‚Äôs a precious gift to humanity in my opinion. This information was also sent to three responsible fire migration research scientists inside the US Department of Forestry, in hopes they may wonder enough to start researching the current Chemtrail impacts on Forestry.  UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES NORCAL FIRES  Fires now have hotter combustion characteristics in heavily Chemtrailed regions, such as Napa-Sonoma Counties. Fire fighters on the front lines are reporting this strangeness.   IT‚ÄôS KILLING THE TREE SEEDS  Regardless of how the fires were started, the  thermite cocktail mix (dominated with aluminum and lesser amounts of barium and strontium oxides) used in Chemtrails, explodes (ignites) at a much hotter temperature during the first few seconds, than clean greenery. The higher initial combustion temperature kills tree seeds and plant-life seeds.   REBALANCE IS NEEDED  Pre-Chemtrail era fires or fires without thermite saturated combustion, do not kill seeds to the same extreme with 1900 degrees F - max firestorm Temp. While nature designed a fire sustainable forest system, human intervention is recklessly destroying nature‚Äôs balance in ways we haven‚Äôt considered. The marginal higher seed kill-off rate is cause by the unnatural higher temperature * of initial combustion.   The cumulative negative effects of unacknowledged Chemtrails now woven into both (a) acknowledged military mission to control the weather by 2020 (Weather Warfare) and (b) woven into innocent piloting of civilian airlines using vented Chemtrail trailing-edge wing ports, placed near engine exhausts, to create fake contrail-clouds, have unintended consequences. The settled thermite dust on everything below, is creating large areas of forest sick zones (forests losing their immune defense systems), and now also, the added loss of viable seed stock falling upon chemically altered soil conditions.   ELECT PEOPLE WILLING TO ENGAGE THE TOPIC  This combination creates a lethal trajectory for forest husbandry. If not stopped, it will be followed by increased soil erosion, loss of forest floors, and greater reflection of sun energy at lower atmospheric levels entrapping more heat in our atmosphere and adding to net atmospheric warming. The higher initial combustion temperatures caused by massive aerial spraying of thermite is a contributing factor now in all our runaway fire disasters.  Elect people who fearlessly discuss Chemtrail topics in their political campaigns and promise to sanction public hearings when elected.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî *Footnote:  Aluminum oxide in fine dust form is found to combust as low as 700 degrees Celsius = 1292 degrees Fahrenheit but once ignited, burst quickly into a super heat fire storm of 2535 - 3500 degrees Celsius, 4595 - 6232 degrees Fahrenheit melting anything and everything in its path.",2,0,Rich Buckley,mQj4BkYf-HM,0.11093750000000001,2017-10-23 01:38:01,False,True

2019-11-23T16:08:56,"Having spent 3 summers driving, getting choppered, and hiking into remote Australian bushland to fight fires, I can identify with this movie in a very real way.  I've had a chopper fly past the main fire, and drop a load of phos-chek straight on our position, causing my team to scramble for cover, as the weight of the falling water caused tree limbs to come crashing down around us.  My off-sider and I once got seperated from our team, and were driving on a track we'd never been before, with thick smoke all around.  We knew we were in an area that the fire was heading, on top of a ridge, and we had to get out.  As we were picking our way along a mountain track, through thick smoke, the fire was racing up the hill toward us.  We had been trained never to drive through thick smoke or flames, but knew that was our only chance to survive, so kept going.  Even with the air conditioner blasting full, the heat from the flames was almost unbearable.  Fortunately, the road was straight in the section that we couldn't see anything, and we finally drove out into the clear.  My fire bag, in the back of the ute, was melted / burned in a few places, and the paint on the ute was bubbled.  In 3 seasons, there were 4 times that I thought it was over, that I wasn't going to make it out alive.  This probably won't make sense to a lot of people, but it was the best time of my life!  Living each moment like it could be your last makes everything sweeter, and more intense.  This movie does a magnificent job of telling the story, and putting the viewer, in the heart of the action.  When you're out on that fire-line, the men and women who are with you is all you have.  That's a bond that lasts forever!  Although there were lots of close calls, the team I was with never lost anyone, but some of the other teams did.  I can't imagine how the one person who survived the Yarnell Hill Tragedy felt.  Brilliant movie, direction, cast, acting, special effects, sound.  It brought back a lot of memories.",1,0,Buck Buchanan,mQj4BkYf-HM,0.16847805788982262,2019-11-23 16:08:56,False,False
