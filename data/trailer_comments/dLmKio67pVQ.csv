2016-03-19T00:17:02,"I avoid commenting on YouTube or starting internet arguments as rule- however, being, a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs, I have to say something here. Basing your notions of fictional characters and fiction storylines off of movies, rumors and pop culture is a bad idea. I know- I thought John Carter and Tarzan were lame from what I saw in movies, but then I read the books. Books bring so much more depth to stories and characters than a movie is capable of. Tarzan and John Carter are very strong and admirable, and not just physically either. They are also very human characters that bear their own unique imperfections and challenges. Their respective books, while they are ""just"" fantasy, are engrossing and sensual, even thought provoking at times - all without being obscene or incredibly violent. Are there some words and ideas in Tarzan that are not politically correct to the modern reader? Sure, the books are 100 years old. Is Tarzan about white dominance and racism? Not by my reading. Tarzan is simply a feral man, of English parentage, raised by Apes on the west coast of Africa who discovers his humanity and has to justify his learned feral nature with his newly discovered manhood- a struggle that lasts a lifetime. The apes are Tarzan's people, even though many do not accept the 'hairless white ape'. Animals and apes are his family, friends and teachers for his formative years- not inferiors to be subjugated. I would say Tarzan is racial at times but not racist or supremacist. In fact, Lord Greystoke has more problems and dislikes for what was considered civilised society at that time than he does with the Apes or Natives of Africa.Violence and dominance in Tarzan's world, by and large, has a purpose and is necessary for order and survival. The same in man's world usually has no purpose or need- we practice violence and deceit and cruelty for their own sakes. I encourage some reading to form an educated opinion- not just on this, but on any subject. Go to the source and form your own opinion. Reading some of these uneducated comments about Tarzan... geez I'm at a loss...really, I knew reading was a lost art, but I fear it may  be worse than I believed. Nobody reads anymore... if you dont like to read or dont have time- check out Librivox.org or Download the app- thousands of FREE, well read audiobooks- including Many E.R. Burroughs books like 'A Princess of Mars' and 'Tarzan of the Apes'... studies show listening to someone read has the same effects and benefits as doing the reading yourself- nothing to lose and every everything to gain.",0,0,IamSalty,dLmKio67pVQ,0.11867544492544495,2016-03-19 00:17:02,True,True

2016-07-02T01:48:50,"YES people will more readily identify with something they have in common. I also think they used the (white) Messiah so a person would be more malleable to their subjugation. The CHRIST was accepted as messiah long before he was anglosized but when you read the history of those who infiltrated the existing societies they sent the priest in first, most societies strengths lies within their belief in their GOD(S) and that His laws are just, and that their man made laws are just. When you fracture that image you fracture their unity.  When you see the person who is telling you your GOD(s) are not GOD and you are convinced that their GOD is, how do you dissociate the resemblance? Once you are conquered your wants and needs are met by the whims of the conqueror, next hopefully acceptance and then usually  assimilation. History has shown those of the Jewish denomination do not readily assimilate, not even when the Messiah did come, nor are they readily accepted. They are still waiting. note: not only did Jesus fulfill a lot of the Messianic prophecy he also fulfilled a lot of the antichrist prophecy. Moses said that GOD would raise a prophet like himself to lead the people but where and when does it say that prophet would be the ACTUAL SON OF GOD.  Jesus was speaking of spiritual bondage while the people were looking for freedom from Roman bondage. It's sad that in a lot of societies the color of one skin matters when it should be the most trivial. Seeing how it's not by choice. Now imagine if it was. I think people would choose more exotic colors. I DONT CARE ABOUT THE COLOR OF A PERSON'S SKIN, SEXUAL PREFERENCE, GOVERNMENT AFFILIATION OR RELIGION I hate when it matters to others.

I also know that a gorilla was slaughtered at a zoo a few weeks ago for fear of the gorilla harming the baby. irony thy name is stop plz. I saw in the trailer the gorilla loose his reign to the same baby now a man. I was told in another e-mail he could commune, communicate with said animals because he was raise by gorillas and being around the animals. while the Africans who are indigenous to the area know nothing of vine commutes are communion, are cummunication with same said animals after thousands of years of living in and around the same area and animals. this isn't the only movie of its type why everyone's panties are in a bunch over what I've written I don't know . but maybe the same old formula of the white man beating all odds to rise above everybody else, while everybody else succumbs is getting a little stale. not only has he mastered the jungle  beat down the natives he's LORD heir to a fortune. being raised by gorillas you don't think he should have found at least one sexy. superman was created by two Jewish guys yet he represents white America even though he's from kryton. rock and roll was jungle music when Chuck berry and little Richard played it, but Elvis was king. the highest selling rap artist was a white guy of course only black people are buying his CD s. Jesus was an Israelite but you can't tell by his mug shot. etc, etc ,etc.. how much more shit can be stolen then anglosized and I not be offended when it's no good unless it is anglosized. how many movies would you go to to see a black man kick some white ass or white people made to look stupid and inferior or whatever race you are you end up without a true representation of your ethnicity. they use to hire white men to play ethnic roles in movies instead of actually hiring Indians are Asians and if you ever watch old b&w you know what roles blacks played.

The public on both sides of the aisle went straight to reality with this movie and the movie didn't gross like it should have why? No one could /would believe a black man in 1860s  AMERICA could/would be hired by the government as an agent and do the things Will Smith were allowed to do in the movie and not get his ass shot, lynched, drug, burned at the stake, castrated, dug up and done again.

2016-09-04T18:20:37,"Tips to improve the marketing for this film:  1. Show more of Jackson. He is the co-lead of the film, funny, a sharpshooter, etc. In fact, illustrate that the film is lighter and funnier than this trailer makes out. It's an adventure movie. His character also helps to ameliorate the intense ""white savior"" cliche of the Tarzan character throughout the film, but no one seeing this trailer would know that.  2. Explain the basic premise. There's nothing here about the Belgian kidnapping Jane to force Tarzan into a duel with Chief Labongo in order to get access to the diamonds, or about how Skarsgard and Jackson are fighting slavers throughout the film. You have to just kind of make up a premise in your head to explain what is happening on screen. Time is not a factor, because they have half this trailer dedicated to a scene that in the movie is over in a couple of minutes and is a flashback (Tarzan's origin). The movie does not dwell on his origin the way this trailer implies. We all know who Tarzan is and the movie understands that, but not the trailer. People may have been turned off by the idea of having to watch young Tarzan for 20 minutes before the movie gets going. That's not how the movie is structured at all, but the trailer makes it out to be that way.",0,0,archfiendbaramos,dLmKio67pVQ,0.18541666666666665,2016-09-04 18:20:37,False,True
