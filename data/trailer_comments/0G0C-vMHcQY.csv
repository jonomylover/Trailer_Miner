Haha also because the first Divergent book was very good and I was very interested in it. And then I read Insurgent and Allegiant and just didn't like them, It took forever to read them cause they just wernt interesting In my opinion.  That was why I didn't even care to watch Insurgent. I didn't even think the events of insurgent needed to be there, that if you read the first book, maybe add about 1/3  of insurgent to Allegiant, but take the Insurgent out of the picture completely,  and go straight from Divergent to Allegiant, it wouldn't make much of a difference.   I am actually planning on seeing Allegiant part 2 just to watch YOU-KNOW-WHO die haha.

2015-12-29T01:49:15,"So I have a theory now why they changed the plot so much and the name of the last movie. So after the ending of Allegiant (the book) many of the fans were disappointed because (SPOILER!!!!) tris sacrifices herself in the end for Caleb and dies. So I think the movie makers wanna give the fans the ending they hoped for and changed the plot in a way that tris will live. I think the Allegiant movie will contain the whole third book, because in the trailer are too much things that happen in the end of the book (e.g. That Chicago will be erased, that comes out at the very end if the book). So that means that the fourth movie ascendents won't have anything to do with Allegiant and that's why they change the names and the movies slogan is the end is never what you expect because we all can't know the ending because it's an additional story/book. I could be completely wrong but that's my theory on this whole movie fiasco.",2,0,Lukas Birkner,0G0C-vMHcQY,0.011363636363636362,2015-12-29 01:49:15,True,True

There was no running across red deserts and the use of these sophisticated laser guns neither was there an invisible wall, which would only exist in a fantasy world....and this book is NOT supposed to be some fantasy world! It's supposed to display a normal world that we live in, none of this crazy ass, futuristic technology. There was no flying car thinys....there was trucks. And they drove in a truck to an abandoned railroad, NOT an invisible wall. The Bureau of Genetic Welfare isnt supposed to look like what everyone imagines a building in a future world would look like, its supposed to be a normal building that used to be an airport. They are ruining the simplicity of the book. Why are they trying to display the story in a futuristic world? Because it did not. Sure, the story is something that will most likely never ever happen to our world today, but that doesn't make it a futuristic story. Seriously? And, in the book, Tris didnt even know what tablet-like devices were, like the one that David gave to her to read her mother's journal and now its all about the technology and like she already knew all about it. And then the Part 2 name change to Ascendant? Like what the actual fuck??? Why cant they just do Allegiant Part 2? They are ruining the books by doing this. Its almost like they are disrespecting them, because the books are very well written and i respect them as super good books. In fact, so good that i have read the whole series over three times.

Zoe? Either way, no. 3. Where's Matthew? Amar? George? TORI?! All important to the plot, none apparent in the trailer.  Things I Don't Have A Problem With: 1. The plot doesn't seem to follow the plot of the book at all, which I hated to begin with. 2. Emphasis on Tris being unique. They kinda glossed over that in the books, but it justifies her prominence with the Bureau outside of Chicago. 3. Technology. I'm not mad at it. If the Bureau can design all of these serums and things, why can't they make hovercrafts? Does Dystopian America have to lack technology?

Allegiant was worse than Insurgent, again very bad pacing and unspectacular action scenes.  Given the budgets they could and should have all been great! Shame.

2017-02-02T01:14:40,"In my opinion...Divergent the book sucks and i understand why it sells but honestly its not all that entertaining ,but was entertaining to its target audience which is mainly girls and the youth,it was popular with a lot of girls and kids aged 13 and under,it isn't all that great and but im not surprised how mainstream it got and the movies were worse,but enjoyable,im happy the movies at least got a trilogy though. What made me not like Divergent the most,is that we are seeing a trend of young women being protagonists in an action,romance,thriller series which as a guy tbh a times i find annoying and repetitive when that story is balls,but thats not the main problem and i think its amazing how women are getting main roles in action novels/movies and i love inclusivity of all races,genders and beliefs...but i can list soooo many of these movies it makes me hurl and dont get me wrong some of them are amazing for example twilight but the others are just fan service and love triangles and obvious mystery plots  and flawed main characters and also one sided writing and sexism...like tf,but the one book that comes to mind the quickest after reading the plot of the novel Divergent....the Hunger Games now this annoyed me that they were so similar tbh especially when the movie(Divergent) is like a wannabe Hunger Games which made it worse,dont get me wrong,the author of the book is great and this was an original idea,maybe if this came out before Hunger Games it would have received better a better book reception and movie ratings,in fact im almost positive it would,but the sad reality it was always being compared to the Hunger Games which is far better and also the reason why many people including me did not like the concept and story cause we feel it is repeating an idea(hunger games) and tweaking it,mainly i disliked Divergent because i mean come on it reminded me of Hunger Games and im(and everyone else) always comparing it to Hunger Games which had in my opinion a better main character,characters,book and story. The Hunger Games was fvcking amazing. My point being i felt that this book was like trying to be like Hunger Games and it was annoying,but it was still enjoyable. I  know this is very contradicting,like i found the book and movie enjoyable,but at the same time the story was flawed and also felt like a tweaked copy from another story,also the characers coulda been better,the only characters i liked was Beatrice and Wills characters from the original novel.",0,0,Sinah Refilwe Pitswane,0G0C-vMHcQY,0.18196212121212121,2017-02-02 01:14:40,False,False

But i mean, you cant turn a whole book into a movie without changing anything. And i know they made it more sci-fi and action than the book, but it actually follows the storyline of the book. And i understand why it is more sci-fi and action, because they want to attract more people than just divergent fans. It works different with movies than with books, becuase movies are living in a commercial world. Just because it isn't the same as the book doesn't mean it is rubbish. And because everybody went home after insurgent, becuase it was different from the book. Allegiant had a bad box office, what has lead to cut the budget of Ascendant and made it into a TV-series. And because of that decision Shai and Theo left the movie. AND THAT ALL BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOKS???!!! Im so sorry for all the ""fans"" who are angry because the movies dont look like the books. But it is impossible to make a movie exactly the same as a book. I've read the books, and i love them. And i loved the movies too, because i'm a fan. So if you dont like the movies because they dont look like the book, back off and dont call yourself a fan. Because the REAL FANS who are waiting for Ascendant now are really dissapointed  because of the people who have just let the series down because they dont look like the book.
