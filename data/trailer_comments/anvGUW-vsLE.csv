I would love this because in the first Alice book the queen is called The Queen of Hearts, in the second ""Through the Looking Glass"" it is a completely different queen called the Red Queen. Now in most movie and tv adaptations they make these two one and the same, also the story is usually pushed together as one and the same (looking glass world is not Wonderland) so it would be cool if because the Queen of Hearts lost her throne in the first movie, she calls herself The Red Queen now that she's in the wilderness.

2018-03-24T14:46:43,"I was born on January 27, the same day Nick Mason the drummer of Pink Floyd was born. Pink Floyd released an album titled""the darkside of the moon."" The first song on that album is ""Breathe"" in that song there is a lyric that goes ""run rabbit run."" Eminem starred in the movie 8 mile as the character""B Rabbit."" The movie was loosely based on the poem series "" run rabbit run"" by John Updyke. John died 7 years after the movie on my birthday January 27. Eminem released a song titles ""the yellow brick road"" and Elton John released an album titled "" leaving the yellow brick road"" both Elton and Eminen performed a song together titled ""Stan."" Eminen released his autobiography titled ""the darkside of Eminem"" the chapter ""Stan"" starts on my birthday page 127. In 1995 an article was released in Ft. Wayne Indiana titled ""the darkside of the rainbow"" this article is where the story first originated that the pink Floyd album syncs up with the movie the wizard of Oz. Fort Wayne is the city I would walk the yellow brick road 8 years later in real life in the same city the darkside of the rainbow originated. I walked the yellow brick road in real life the day after Carmelo Anthony led the Syracuse orangemen over the Kansas Jayhawks to win there first NCAA championship in 2003. I almost drowned where the St. Joseph river meets the St Mary's river to form the Miami river. I was born on January 27 the same day Lewis Carrol who wrote Alice in wonderland was born. Marilyn Manson the Antichrist has been trying to release the movie "" phantamgoria"" a movie where he plays a sadistic evil Lewis Carrol. Lewis was a hard core Christian. Notice how this entire block of writing involves rabbits? If you add a cross to Rabbi you get Rabbit. That's the Jewish, Christian connection. I'm still not even scratching the surface. With all I know, and as easy I lay out things for humans, its very frustrating that people are too full of themselves to take just one second to shut up and listen.
