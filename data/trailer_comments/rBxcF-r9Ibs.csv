If Fridge, Martha, and the 2 granddads are in the game, then that leaves out the possibility that Bethany didn't go in the game. Note that we didn't see the game suck Bethany in.

Fridge,Bethany, and Martha go to save him but Spencer's grandfather is in there and Mylo Walker too. Fridge becomes Shelly Oberon instead of Mouse Finbar. Bethany was probably that woman we saw or she is a different character who is in trouble along with Spencer. Or maybe in the real world because Fridge took her character. They all try to save them but also finish the game too. Then they all come out of the game, and all of them are now even closer. Or maybe they stay in there. Who knows? That's just my theory.

I think Beth will be playing the pilot ( Nick Jonas ) as she used to have a crush on the pilot guy it would be fun to see her playing as her old crush (the  pilot) and the new girl could have a chance being played by Spencer but I doubt it would,my guess she's only NPC.",134,16,Vinn Rush,rBxcF-r9Ibs,0.09786756453423119,2019-07-02 09:10:03,True,True

He was awestruck with the power, attention and being Hero in front of everyone in the body of Rock. So he decides to go back to game so he could live like that. And one afternoon he vanishes into game. But all doesn't go as expected and he never got into Rocks body in Game but into some other body with different dimensions because game wanted him to learn a lesson. His friends then realizes that Spencer is absent and nowhere to be found then they reach to his home to enquire..

Obviously, in the prequel there should be new players, even if to bury the mysterious box will be Caleb and Benjamin, who will not be present in the film, since the actors are now grown! The prequel would have a lot of charm because: set in the hear  past, Jumanji is still a board game and not a video game and maybe, using the narrative style of the original movie ""1995"" decidedly more beautiful than the sequel of ""2017"", although I appreciated very much that movie too!

The boss is just a regular human with brute strength (he gains nothing from the stone, mehhhhhh) he just wants it to kept from the dark (moooree meehhhh)   Come on!
