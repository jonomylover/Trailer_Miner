Also going by the trailer, I think it really doesn't seem to understand that subtlety was one of the things that made Dirty Rotten Scoundrels work so well. The type of characters Caine and Martin played as well came across as more natural/realistic, as Caine's character gave off the air of a suave aristocrat and Martin played the more rugged/rougeish grifter. Hathaway seems to have her part down fine, but Wilson's playing another Rebel Wilson character and it doesn't appear to be working.

Which isn't to say I dislike it. I do. But I like it more as a character piece in that I really enjoy Michael caines character. The sophisticated con man gentlemen whose jaded but has a good heart deep down. Which you see in how he refuses to steal from the poor. With how he chooses to accept defeat with dignity. It also has that lovely twist about Janet. And then she comes back. And I ship the two of them so hard. And as far as I'm concerned they then got married and became partners in crime and had babies. I'm probably reading way too much into this but when Janet runs back at the airport and Michael caines character comes to hug her, I think that he was hoping she'd stay with him. Cuz he's hopelessly in love with her. And then he finds out that she's just like him and that makes him even happier. I ship them very hard. Which is possibly why I really hate the other guy. This new movie does seem to be funnier.
