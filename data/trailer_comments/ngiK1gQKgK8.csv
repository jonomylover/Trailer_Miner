I have a studder and a heart condition so I always sort of stood out. Normally the heart condition wouldn't be a problem but there was this stupid board at school with kids who had possible life threatening conditions and kids would avoid me because they thought they could catch it. The fact I was taller then every kid when I was younger really didn't help that much also. Long story short this is so a movie I will be seeing. I will probably see it multiple times and then buy it after it comes out. Thank you whoever made this and everyone who had a part in making this.

Every teacher I have tells me that this is too easy as I am reading on a 12th grade reading level which is true, but I love it so much that I read it in my free time. It sends a great message, and I wish it was a middle school requirement across the country. When this movie comes out fellow Wonder fans and I will be in the theaters watching! I hope teachers continue to read and inspire other teachers to read this to students because as a student who once had it read aloud, I can tell you first hand that it does make a difference!

Now I just feel completely let down and disappointed. First of all, the actor who plays Aggie hardly looks like he has a facial-cranial deformity- so, basically, terrible make-up job, does not drive the point home about how severe Aggie's deformities are in the book. But, the fact that it is a make-up job just sends a terrible message to children with these deformities. A child with Treacher-Collins syndrome should have been cast as Aggie; to children with facial deformities this just sends the message that they are still not good enough- that their deformities are still too severe for them to be cast in a movie and that even a mask has to be watered down to be good enough for the public to sympathize.
