2015-05-04T06:48:16,"I just watched this movie. It is similar to Money Ball in many ways but more lighthearted. I have a question though.    When you see all the back door wheeling and dealings, and trades. What difference does it make if you get a first or second or third round for the next season, if you're going to trade them away?   I don't watch the draft. I think watching it is silly. But, if the movie is correct in it's depiction of what goes on, that's the interesting thing. If you could see that, that would be worth watching. And if that truly is the way things are done, then what you see when you watch the draft is merely the product of all that.    It's like only being able to see the touchdown and not all the plays that made it happen.   The movie is interesting, too bad it got bogged down with all that fluffy stuff.    Why would the mom pick that day of all days to insist on spreading the ashes on the field? She clearly is interested and knows what's going on, even to the point of confronting Sonny about tweets. But then she waltzes in expecting him to drop everything and do that. I didn't buy it. I love Ellen Burstyn but that was bad writing.     So now when I hear people talking about the draft in reality, are they taking all of the sausage making into consideration? Is there a computer whiz kid somewhere, like in Money Ball calculating that logarithm? Maybe somewhere in Las Vegas. Does Las Vegas take bets on the draft?    That's where this movie takes my mind. That didn't happen with Money Ball. And I know why. It's because the baseball season is long, quite long. And the football season is very short.    In baseball even a good top tier team can afford to lose a certain amount of games and still make a run for the Pennant. Whereas in football, that window is not calculated in games but quarters. There are just so many quarters that you can suck in, and still be in a winning season.    I suppose that a whiz kid would say no. It's not quarters but minutes.     Now I think an interesting movie would be about how football teams devise strategems to use on their opponents. Instead of showing the auction block, have it be about play calling.   How come there isn't a Ken Burns type documentary about football. It must come from an independent source and not a product of the NFL. If there is one let me know.",0,2,nelliebly,xpvInmz-EJM,0.10172735760971055,2015-05-04 06:48:16,False,False
