There has never been a reported sighting of a shark breaching in Australia. Also, if a shark did attack one of the guys swimming, then they almost certainly would not have attacked the second guy, let alone chase him down to the rock. Great white sharks have very, very sensitive teeth, as soon as they bite into you and realize that you do not have the fat density that they need for their diet (like a seal), they usually lose interest except for in cases of extreme hunger. A shark would never, never wait around a rock waiting for a person to jump in the water.

It's hard to kill ANYthing with a flare gun, mainly because it's NOT meant to be a weapon! But, I guess since it has 'gun' in the name the writer assumed that meant it was deadly in any case.

I've been surfing in California, Hawaii, and the South Pacific and seen great whites, tiger sharks, and a variety of reef sharks. If this were to happen in real life it would be as follows: 1) shark sees Blake Lively from underwater and thinks she is a seal 2) shark bites Lively, realizes she is not a seal, and swims away in search of a seal 3) Lively waits 10-15 minutes on the rock before shark is gone and swims to shore 4) Lively most likely dies as a result of the poor medical facilities on a remote island OR by getting hit on the head with a coconut, since falling coconut accidents cause more deaths per year than shark attacks.

We see a person who was bit by a huge shark that left a wound that would be too small for its mouth. Even with the bite being smaller than it should've been it would still be too deep to pull off the amazing speed she pulls off while swimming.

This leads me to think the main concept behind this movie is about the consequences of doing this to such an active and dangerous predator. The people making the movie only show you a number of money shots, of which there will probably be more action than you think you've seen, to get your attention and highlight the premise of the film. The basic premise that she is stuck on the water despite being close to shore is probably the scariest notion the trailer portrays, the idea of being so close to safety from the threat, yet so far.

I would be happy to see this movie, if I hadnt seen Jaws years before this started production.    I want to go into the film business self-taught and I wanna direct movies that will (hopefully) make it big.  For me to do that, I have been watching and critiquing movies based on its use of effects to progress the story, a compelling story, and characters we can relate to and base ourselves on.    But this movie.  This movie is a clear and blatant rip off of the classic movie Jaws.  Sure, you can argue that this is a different plot, and a lot of things are different, but look at the overall characters, and the whole plot in general.  Hell, a lot of the scenes in this trailer alone clearly mimic classic scenes from Jaws.  The blood in the water,  yelling out ""SHARK!""  to alert the people, swimmers being drug into the ocean by an unknown force, and of course, that gun shot.  I can get if this movie would be a sequel to the Jaws movies, or a homage to that franchise, but this trailer shows otherwise.  I would suggest to the people who think that this movie looks great and original to go watch the first Jaws movie, and then relate this trailer to that movie.

And when Blake's not surfing she's an oceanographer who knows everything there is to know about sharks. Let's see. The tourista board  of that area was warned to shut down the beach but kept it open to make money.  .... Nah, none of all that.

2016-05-14T16:25:42,"okokokokokokokokok FIRST OF ALL, the size of that shark is bigger than roughly an average great white, other than the issue with size, Great whites aren't typically found in shallow waters. More commonly, you'd find a black or white tip reef sharp, which is significantly smaller and has identifiable black tips on its fins and tail (vise vera for white tip). OR MAYBE a mako, but even then, a mako is much slimmer than that. Not only is this VERY inaccurate, it also depicts sharks as vicious evil monsters. Which is: A. Not original, and B. not true. Sharks would not eat a person unless they had to or unless they mistook them for a seal. Not to mention, the shark would not wait that long for the girl to come down, it would find another source of food.

2016-05-21T22:45:13,So let's be honest here. Someone has made an entire movie out of the opening scene of jaws when Chrissie Watkins is eaten by the shark. Let's just break that down. There is buoy which Chrissie grabs hold of when the shark is attacking her.  She is then grabbed again and dragged under water screaming. Nauturally the director will crap on about how inspired he was by Jaws and it is a homage. A homage is hack's way of getting around the fact they are ripping someone off. You have nods too rather than direct scene borrowing. Deep Blue Sea is the last great shark film. It was awesome. Harlin's Jaws nod was the number plate that Thomas Jane retrieves from the mako's teeth as it is in fact the same one Dreyfuss removes form the tiger shark on the dock when he cuts it open.,0,2,Nathan White,EgdxIlSuB70,0.12870370370370368,2016-05-21 22:45:13,True,True

Instead of creating fear about these animals, the media should be spreading information and facts about them in order to teach the masses about these fish. The people should learn to respect them, and want to protect them from human-driven extinction, instead of fearing them through ignorance and stupidity.

Shark attacks may be on the rise, but only because we as humans are destroying their ecosystems and habitats, warming their oceans and depleting their food resources.

Jaws was and is still an iconic movie its time one of the first and best Shark movies. Has been eclipsed. Also the person who stated that a real Shark would not attack the amount this one did well look what was floating in the water. Second It knows its found a good feeding ground so why leave? recall the line in Jaws when it was said Great Whites Eat and make little baby sharks. it matters none to them who you are unless you are an Orca then matters might be diferent.

2020-04-02T20:26:38,"I really enjoyed this film because as per usual I don't listen to people who are Paid To Criticize...  They should try creating something instead of moaning about other people's music/movies & books et al  Seriously who stood up in class as a Kid & said "" I want to become a Critic! "" So Sad...  That's aside with any movie you have to leave your brain at the door to a certain degree as even True Story Films have content in them that never happens but it pads out the movie & if done properly adds more layers to the narrative without taking too many liberties when it is in fact a true story... I'm not saying The Shallows is based on a True Story I'm just adding that films whether fiction or fact need (at times) scenes that keep the movie ticking along...  I was glad to see that the shark was not seen as a mindless killing machine & it was in fact like many real shark attacks it's been humun(s) that have strayed into their territory & this movie clearly shows (without giving anything away) that the shark in question was challenging anything that would come close to the dead whale as sharks predominately feast on rich blubber from whales & again this movie doesn't try to tell you that the character has found this out too late as you see this for yourself onscreen...  I enjoyed the way the character opened up about her life & though she would fight til the end I'm guessing she knew she wouldn't make it back to shore...  I remember my Dad taking me to see Jaws when it was first released in 1975 & being only 8 years young I was absolutely fascinated with the ocean especially great white sharks/orcas/architeuthis & other giant squids & marine biology in general but after watching Jaws I knew my life had been changed & I'd still look to the skies but the inner space of the ocean holds far more valuable information that could/maybe one day eradicate many illnesses like Cancer/Aids/Parkinson/MS/Fibromyalgia & M.E just to name a few but we shouldn't just take from the ocean but conserve the lives of all who live & thrive in oceans of this world also...  Any way my main gripe is not of this movie but about Content overall that comes with DVD's & Blu Ray Films or should I now say Lack Of Content...  For those old enough to remember the advent of Films from VHS/Laserdisc & then  on to DVD it was not only better visually but you had hours of added extras in the way of Behind The Scenes/Blooper Reel & much much more & more often than not you had hours of visualing pleasure & information about the movie & even separate parts predominately about the subject matter of that film but for the last 15 years & then with Blu Ray we have saw DVD Film's go from being jam packed with content about that particular movie & it started to get less & less & I thought with Blu Ray it would pick up again with in film content but No it's just as bad & your lucky if you get a few 5 minutes worth of extras!..  I can understand why Big Studios were at first against Films on Video Format but instead of taking away revenue it added it & many movies became cult classics via Video like John Carpenters remake of "" The Thing "" as that (excuse my wording) bombed in the cinemas & was one of his first badly recieved movies in the cinema as it was just too out there & gory but time has shown that it found it's audience via Video & even critics changed their opinion of it over those many years to the point it's on the Top 100 Best Films ever made & if you have read the orignal story from book  "" Who Goes There "" it is very faithful to the book/characters & creatures mentioned within the book & that makes The Thing an even better accomplished movie as that Book was practically at the time just not feasible to do visual effects wise but Rob Bottin & his crew upped their game & took on the challenge & it still stands strong today as when it was first released but if it wasn't for video/laserdisc & then DVD & Blu Ray many films would've been lost in underground vaults somewhere never to be seen & again it comes back to overall content that we get now even with Blu Ray or 4K as it's next to nothing like when Dvds were first released...  I thought it would pick up content wise when Blu Ray came out but nope it's pretty much the same basic next to no extras & if they want sales to continue for DVD/Blu Ray & 4K then distributors need to add all this extra content back in as who is going to buy a basic DVD/Blu Ray film with either No or Next To No Extra Content when they can save their money & wait until it's steamed on some website or Film App...  But alas I think they've made their mind up as many of today's films can been seen for practically nothing but if you entice fans of a film with all the extras put back in like it used to be they will buy it whether it's streamed or not...   In Light of the coronavirus Take Care/Stay Healthy & All The Best...   Ps  Though I will add That it's up to you to make up your own minds: But Don't Believe Everything You See or Hear on the News & so many social media sites... I'm not disputing that there's a virus or something else that's making people ill & worst case scenario is dying but I've never seen the World react to a virus that first discovered in the 1951 & though this strain is immune to antibiotics, something just doesn't smell right as so much of the information given to us contradicts itself & makes no sense when you really think on it...  Again Stay Safe but do not be driven by mass hysteria perpetrated by those in Power/whats said in the News & All Over The Internet...  Do your thinking for yourselves & again Take Care One & All..   .....",1,0,YouTube Is An Influencer,EgdxIlSuB70,0.143953554233928,2020-04-02 20:26:38,False,False
