He is the ACTUAL leader of the X-MEN after all. It also bugs me that they keep coming up with contrivances to have Mystique look human. Yes fine, Jen's a big star now and we can't use Jackman for much longer so you want to emphasis that she's in this film, I get that, but it goes against the whole point of Mystique as a character. She's kinda being a bit of a hypocrite telling everyone not to be ashamed of their abilities if she keeps turning into her human-looking self every time she steps outside. I'm hopeful for this film, and I like Bryan Singer's respect for the source material's subtext more than most, regardless of the kinda bland blue/silvery look he tends to go for in these films but the stuff with Cyclops, Jean and Nightcrawler looks WAY more interesting than baby-faced Mystique and I'm fearful we might not get it...",15,3,Samuel Gavin,PfBVIHgQbYk,0.1592105263157895,2016-03-17 14:01:57,True,True

But this version of the X-men kinda looks like, well, weak (not that the other ones were strong)?!! especially Bryan Singers directing skills are not good enough for the scale of an Apocalypse, every shot feels so alone and the World where the Movie plays just feels empty. Look at Man of Steel, B vs S, Lord of the rings, the World seems alive, consequences are possible, for example now in the new Civil War trailer, we see how the actions of the first Avengers movie had an effect on humanity, but this ? It feels empty, dry and kinda hipsterish I guess, ""let's get young actors from popular shows"" was the Idea behind the casting, it feels lazy and the script as little as we know, was just, meh. I know, no one should judge a book by its cover but this is just the same with Deadpool, everything worth mentioning already happened. from an early perspective: 6.0/10  Trailers should get us excited, while not telling us exactly what happens (like the Suicide Squad trailers) this looks at best mediocre.",0,3,Burak Recep Karakurt,PfBVIHgQbYk,0.06105800064133397,2016-03-17 14:26:06,True,True

I find this to be unnecessary and just an overuse of their ability by the director and 3) I'm almost certain being slammed into a wall by a giant 'god' - and have said wall crumble from the impact - would have a damaging/crushing effect on Xavier.....again maybe there's more to the scene than meets the eye but hey......being a comic junkie and  LOVER OF BOTH DC/MARVEL franchises.....I am SOOOOOO GLAD I'm alive to see all these comics leap from the pages onto the silver screen!!!! #FANBOY FOREVER!!",2,3,Nigel Ward,PfBVIHgQbYk,0.19131295340401785,2016-03-17 23:18:03,True,True

I have always enjoyed Marvel over DC in comics, but in movies DC gets it right more often.The Marvel movies just look and feel cheesy and cheap. The backgrounds(sets) are too bright and generic and just don't feel immerseful. DC is dark and gritty. A tone that should be set for what story is suppose to be going on.The backgrounds compliment the characters and the mood. Apoc looks like a fool in this. Just like Thanos (which their first showing of him actually looked good), they made him look awful. Thanos' head is too big for his body and looks like a gourd. In comics he was built like the Hulk. Both Apoc and Thanos are menacing, intimidating characters just on looks alone. Evil, dark and twisted.  The movies just need to stop. You can't get something right that was mainly geared to market kids merchandise. Yes I know comics were mostly too. It just would have been nice to see an adult spin be given to them.The idea in the beginning was for the directors to give them that much wanted approach. That went by the wayside fast for dollar signs. I know they took a different approach with Deadpool.

2016-03-18T18:13:25,"Honestly I don't understand some of these comments. The original trilogy people were up in arms how they didn't stick to the comics. Now people are up in arms over how the CGI looks off, or how it doesn't feel like a comic book movie, wolverines not in it, or that it's a bad plot. Let me educate the masses, first this is the origin of the xmen and wolverine was not an original member and two Hugh Jackman is almost 50 years old he can't play him forever. Three you guys are complaining about the CGI but how exactly to you expect to have an xmen movie with no CGI or Green screen? Can we look at the avengers movies and GOTG a lot the villains were CGI and backgrounds too and so was the Hulk and Scarlet Witches powers(which definitely looked worse than Psylockes in terms of cgi) so if the Avengers is mostly CGI and green screen how is it you can complain out the xmen, people like to hate. Four we have costumes that ARE from the comics, we have characters that look JUST like there comic book characters (nightcrawler, storm, angel, psylocke) how is it that it doesn't look like a comic book movie. The people who made the film changed Apocalypses voice over outraged fans in the comics yet people are still complaining about it. And the ones complaining about the plot go read the comics the plot has been established long before it was a movie, go watch the cartoon show too while your at it or play xmen legends 2. Point is i'm saying instead of criticizing this trailer and film for things you would not criticize about other marvel movies and being to knit picky and particular ( because I swear someone will leave a comment like I don't like Charles is breathing in one shot ) can we enjoy and show excitement for the film, instead of taking time out of your life to write how you wont like it.",1,0,EmmanKR,PfBVIHgQbYk,0.018650793650793668,2016-03-18 18:13:25,True,True

She and beast become leaders because Charles is incapacitated  (again lol) and Eric has joined apocalypse  They're the only two with any experience.

I just think its not fair the avengers is the only that is talked about when it comes modern day media.

2016-08-28T04:16:36,"Batman vs. Superman < X-Men: Apocalypse < Suicide Squad < Deadpool < Civil War X-Man: Apocalypse, in comparison to First Class and Days of Future Past, was extremely poor. Mischaracterization (making Mystique the hero), lazy writing (Magneto, once again, becoming the villain rather than the anti-hero he is in the comics/Age of Apocalypse storyline), lack of continuity (Quicksilver having Charles' business card even though Charles took it back, Logan ending up in Weapon X even though Raven saved him in DOFP), and excessive CGI really affected the quality of the film.  First Class and Days of Future Past, I feel, perfectly explored the emotional and philosophical depth the comics have. Peace vs. War, Oppressed vs. Privileged, Athleticism vs. Intelligence, Conformity vs. Pride -- all of these themes, which reflect the current society we endure, were brilliantly explored in the previous films. With Apocalypse, they ditched those themes and replaced them with star power and lazy writing.  The other films, while mostly disappointing and/or underwhelming, really captured the feel of the comics. The characters were properly written (although some background stories were FAR too rushed *cough* SS *cough*), the action sequences were (mostly) tame yet engaging, and the overall vibe made the other films feel great.
