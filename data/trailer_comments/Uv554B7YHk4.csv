Rocky had that naturally in the ring, but he doesn't know how to teach someone else to have the eye of a killer, he's too nice! He gets far but not yet to the top. He's still in his dads shadow. To get the eye of a snarling mad wrecking machine that just won't quit Rocky sets up a secret match behind closed doors. Creed enters the ring in a run down gym, there is no-one there. A door out of shot slams shut, Creed looks over, his face changes from anticipation to confused awe. We hear a man step into the ring, the camera pans over to where Creed is looking and reveals it to be Ivan Drago. Though much to Creeds disapproval, Rocky's plan to turn Creed from nothing more than a man living in his dad's shadow and wanting to prove that he is his dads equal into snarling mad wrecking machine that just won't quit works instantly. Now there is no stopping Creed from getting to the top and along the way, he learns to forgive Ivan which allows him to finally bury his demons.   Yeah it's corny but it just feels so Rocky like :)",0,0,radbot1,Uv554B7YHk4,0.12473544973544974,2015-07-01 16:31:57,True,True

2015-07-02T10:00:43,"In Britain, slavery continued to be practiced following the fall of Rome and sections of Hywel the Good's laws dealt with slaves in medieval Wales. The trade particularly picked up after the Viking invasions, with major markets at Chester and Bristol supplied by Danish, Mercian, and Welsh raiding of one another's borderlands. At the time of the Domesday Book, nearly 10% of the English population were slaves. Slavery in early medieval Europe was so common that the Roman Catholic Church repeatedly prohibited it — or at least the export of Christian slaves to non-Christian lands was prohibited at e.g. the Council of Koblenz (922), the Council of London (1102), and the Council of Armagh (1171). In 1452, Pope Nicholas V issued the papal bull Dum Diversas, granting the kings of Spain and Portugal the right to reduce any ""Saracens (antiquated term referring to Muslims), pagans and any other unbelievers"" to perpetual slavery, legitimizing the slave trade as a result of war. The approval of slavery under these conditions was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex bull of 1455. However, Pope Paul III forbade enslavement of the native Americans in 1537 in his papal bull Sublimus Dei. Dominican friars who arrived at the Spanish settlement at Santo Domingo strongly denounced the enslavement of the local native Americans. Along with other priests, they opposed their treatment as unjust and illegal in an audience with the Spanish king and in the subsequent royal commission.",0,0,John Gabberson,Uv554B7YHk4,0.022646103896103886,2015-07-02 10:00:43,True,True

Gone is the Ali like banter of Creed, gone is the fact that his son would have been well off, instead we are greeted with the decaying urban landscape, gone is the fact he would have lots of advantages to getting into the boxing world, replaced by the underdog story and having to be trained by people not in the fighting world. No way the son of Apollo Creed grows up an outsider and an underdog. Just an attempt to return to tropes of the boxing genre instead of giving the film any new perspective.

Now we can assume his wife was 1 or 2 months pregnant because they didn't tell anybody. Adonis says he never knew him. So obviously he was born after the death of Apollo. Rocky 6 was filmed in 2006  we know this because rocky still has his restaurant. Here's something intresting. In 1:36, you can clearly see Adonis wearing bred 11 highs. Bred 11s came out in 2012. So this film had to be set in 2012 or 2013. Rocky also looks older so we can assume that this film takes place in 2012 or 2013. Or Adonis had the bred 11s since release and the film was set in 2015.

Interesting twist Creed but not sure if it has the feel of a Rocky film. What's more strange is they are using cruiserwight boxer Tony Bellew as the villain. We will see if he can act or will he be himself cause he is quite vocal guy and enjoys all the trash talk and is pretty good at it. David Haye and Tyson Fury are 2 other Brit Boxers who would have been interesting for the role.

The only thing I don't quiet understand about the series is, why does Apollo Creed's son feel like he has something to fight for, yet Rocky Balboa's son does not?  Of course they're 2 different people, but they're the sons of the 2 greatest fictional boxers of all time, so surely it has to be in the genes right? I mean it's like both son's were born into wealthiness, with the Creed family being much better off financially than the Balboa family, until Rocky took the torch away from Apollo that is, won it all, lost it all again, then got some of it back with the flourishing restaurant business. Robert never had the heart of a fighter, yet Adonis has, so it's as if Apollo Creed's son (whom I'm guessing never knew his father) can relate to Rocky (as a father figure) much more than Rocky's own son can relate to his own father.

Conclusion of this film sorry to say Rocky has officially been raped in the cinema like what they did to the indiana jones movie, whoever said they should oscar this film has got mental issues need to seek help. what and ending to rockys legacy   I might need to make a video to stress how bad this film was how can this be 8.0 / 10 on imdb wtf man",0,0,Andres Rodriguez,Uv554B7YHk4,0.014443076081007113,2016-01-22 01:46:29,False,True

No film and no team of actors will ever be able to recreate the magic that the original Rocky film and cast gave to us all, not in a million years. This is a good film, but its not a 'great' film and certainly not one that people will be talking about 30 years from now. How I hope they don't kill Rocky off in a similar scenario to Mickey. Personally I wish they hadn't brought the illness of cancer into the movie, it spoilt it for me. I hope were all not going to be put through seeing Rocky passing away in a deeply sad way. I almost hope they leave it to our own imagination, but I feel they won't.

Rocky telling him that's its going to be okay when he thinks he can't win without him. Giving him the cuff link that Mickey gave him, telling him he'll be his angel. They should have it where hes just about to go and he sees Adrian, still fairly young, kneel down beside him, mirroring the way he kneeled down beside her when she was in a coma. Shes smiling at him not saying anything, and with that, his last words simply being 'Adrian'.  For me, that's my perfect ending. Honestly got teared up just typing this out haha.

2018-10-23T01:36:26,"This is an awesome movie. The Rocky legacy continues, but so does the Apollo Creed legacy when Apollo's son Adonis played by Michael B. Jordan seeks out Rocky to train him to fight, at first Rocky does not want anything to do with him trying to leave that life behind but he ends up warming up to the kid and becomes his trainer. Adonis goes by his mother's last name trying not to follow in his father's shadow but towards the end of the movie, he realizes that owning up to your heritage is not a bad thing. This is a great movie it has the feel and charm of the first movie and Sylvester Stallone is excellent as always and he is the only original that returns we find out that Paulie died and that Robert his son moved away. The only new major characters we meet is Adonis, Bianca played by Tessa Thompson and Pretty Ricky Conlan played by Tony Bellew who is Adonis's opponent. The acting is great, the story is great, the directing is great and the music is great. We also find out that Rocky has cancer and watching him get treatment and train Adonis in the hospital was awesome especially the part where he says that the nurse could go a couple of rounds.
