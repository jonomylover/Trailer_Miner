2019-10-13T21:27:54,Music is good but not for this movie. This movie need some kind of sarah brightman to do music for this and vangelis for the action and death scenes. Actor is o.k. Maybe Petter weller actor is good to do this his looks like a doctor or that funny skinny Dr Who actor Matt Smith. But RDJ is good too im happy with him..if Dollitle has enemy im sure i choose Anthony Hopkins for that. thx for the trailer,0,0,egy Magyarvagyok,FEf412bSPLs,0.54375,2019-10-13 21:27:54,True,True

Well, its Disney, after all, and if they cannot beat U they will buy U out, or change the story`s characters etc. I`m sure I will see this movie, but if anyone reading this wants to know the true Dr. Doolittle, I encourage the reading of Hugh Lofting`s books; for a child they are all of wonder and for an adult they are a gift of what it was like to have a child`s innocence.

Having read all the books and knowing the characters... half of those animals were nowhere in the Voyages. Who is the little girl? Why is there a gorilla? Is that Cheechee? The Chimpanzee? Seriously.   I just hope that they go with the 'educated man learns animal languages individually by species' plot and not the 'I woke up and they all talked' version.   And they are horribly smooshing multiple books worth of plots into this.   Damnit, is it too much to ask for a book accurate adaptation of the series for freaking once?!?   Hoping that there's no oc sue love interest like in the Rex Harrison version. That was the only true problem in that movie. The Eddie Murphy version was a travesty to the name dolittle.   I was hoping to avoid the human speech from the animals thing too. But I figured that was a doomed cause the day I saw the cast list.   Will wait and see about this film. I have dashed hopes from this trailer. I hope that the environazis have not gotten a hold of the script. I will be pissed if it is full of save the environment garbage. I seriously do not need pandering to in that regard, and it will fall on the deaf ears of those that only listen to profit margins.   Please keep politics out of Dr. Dolittle.

2019-11-02T03:21:09,"Forget the 90s-2000s Dr Dolittle, those movies were just complete spoofs of what Dolittle truly was about. This is far more based on the books, and so was the original 1960s one. He had real African voyages, explored deeper issues with animals and dealing with them. Whatever the 90s-2000s were are just cliched Eddie Murphy (or family legacy) shenanigans featuring animals and someone called Dr Dolittle who lived a stereotypical suburban life in the U.S pandering to the Hollywood fantasy.

The guy just has that swagger that makes him so perfect for the role of an eccentric individual. A great actor can fit multiple roles, but imho the best actors to watch are the ones that naturally fit the roles that they're placed in.   I learned this many years ago while watching movies with John Candy. Sure they could have placed that guy in movies where he was some asshole billionaire, or evil mastermind, and he may have done well in such roles via acting skills, but the majority of the movies he was placed in, he was this big, jolly happy go lucky individual. He did great in those roles because that's the kind of person that he was in real life.
