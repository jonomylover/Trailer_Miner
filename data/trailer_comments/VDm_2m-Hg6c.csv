2017-03-22T15:01:50," Ok just a few things  Pros: - I actually really like the animation as a whole, it feels faithful to the original books with the characters and the setting itself, if I saw this as I kid back when I was really into captain underpants, it would've blown my mind  -It seems like the film is going to adapt 2 of the books at the same time, which makes sense since they are short and need to pad out some time for more content which is fine by me (Please adapt Flip-o Rama!)  Cons -I will say it now, I don't like Kevin Hart and Thomas Middleditch as George and Harold, I have nothing against these guys, but they just make them sound like adults when I hear George talking all i hear is Kevin hart. I don't understand why they couldn't just get or teen voice actor to perform them instead of just having celebrity voice actors just for the sake of having them if they really wanted celebrities couldn't they go with kids or teens? which goes into my next problem...  -The film unfortunately seems like it's going to suffer from a lot of common modern book/tv series movie adaptations, trying to modernize it with pop music and celebrity voice actors, we only saw a little bit here but I hope that it really doesn't turn out that way and the movie does have funny and awesome moments like the original source material has without relying to much on modernizing it.  That being said I am being cautiously optimistic.

Seeing that the same people who worked on those films worked on this one, got me very hyped! I see that this is made by DreamWorks Animation, but you know that Fox gotta' get the money from the book based movie to work on their 6th Ice Age film. Need proof? The Diary of a Wimpy Kid Movie came out in 2007, ice age. 2008: Wimpy Kid 2, Ice Age 2. 2009: Took a break. 2010: Ice Age 3. 2011: Wimpy Kid 3. 2012: Ice Age 4. 2013-14: Break 2015: Charlie Brown 2016: Ice Age 5 2017: Captain Underpants 2018?: Ice Age 6 I think that Fox is trying to find a studio that can work on their book movies while Blue Sky works on Ice Age 6. Now I also think that due to the nostalgia and the over abundance of books that Captain Underpants has will be good for them to work on! Or they might do something else because it's looking like their combining all the first 3 books in to one film! And there's also some spin-off books like both of the Super Diper Baby books, Ook and Guk, and   Dogman! But if they get tired of this and work on some other projects as well! This is great and all, but you know what book I want to see get made into the movie? Junie. B . Jones. Why? SHE WAS SO FUNNY WHEN I WAS IN THE FIRST GRADE! This trailer looks so beautiful and follows the books so well, that it's like what was going on in my head when I was reading the books! A movie!

Voices: 9.5/10 Every voice, besides Harold, is exactly how I imagined it, but Harold's voice is still so good, it could only be better if the scientists voice was a little different. Animation: 9/10 OR 10/10 The thing with this is that in one scene where the principal says ""You've been responsible for one prank after another"", the audio was off-sync AND I'm not sure that's what it was attempting to say. I think this is just because it is a trailer, though, so I'll give it's official rating as a 10/10. Overall Plot: 9/10 Pretty much the same as the book, BUT, it's more detailed and such, since the original is a comic book, so yeah.

I've read the whole series and I expect it to be very relevant to the story line of the original book(s).  So far the voice actors sound exactly how I expected the characters would've sounded like, so a one up on that! And it stuck with the style which I am very proud of. And the comedy in the trailer seems to fit really well.  The trailer looks really good so far, so I have some pretty decent expectations for when the movie comes out. Well, I guess I should re-read the books before the movie releases. So I can compare and see what they added and took out and what details they missed or got.

Another big thing the books had but the movie can't possibly have is Flip-O-Rama.

2017-05-24T00:09:38,"Like, even BEYOND the sheer nostalgia factor of this movie? I genuinely think its gonna be a decent movie fore reeling in kids who are unfamiliar with the books: a movie that'll actually be able to capture two audiences. And, much like the ASOUE series on Netflix did, also bring in people interested in the books.  I like the art a lot. This style of art is... kind of a hit and miss. So many venture into the uncanny valley: look at the Smurfs movies. This has a really good and simple cartoonish art style to it: one not only true to the source material, but also appealing to look at. People who watch these movies don't really want to see hyper-realistic eyes and see every pore in a character's face.  Even if I hadn't grown up with these books, I'd be minorly curious to watch it because it looks genuinely light-hearted, fun, and pleasant to look at. I'm looking forward to this.",3,0,Miyu Shinohara,VDm_2m-Hg6c,0.3222222222222222,2017-05-24 00:09:38,True,True
