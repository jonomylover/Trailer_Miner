2018-06-13T15:33:24,The original cartoon movie was extremely emotionally profound. It was focused on the view point of the little elephant and the other animals he interacted with. It was a movie that taught children to believe in themselves and learn to love yourself when you’re different. The mother being ripped away was by far the hardest moment in the movie. I don’t know if they are going to tackle all this by implementing a “human family” with the elephants journey. Humans were not seen as positive/good natured in the original which was important for kids to understand that “hey people can be cruel too”.  The original dumbo movie was best described as a bitter sweet tale with important life lessons. This made it a classic. Not sure if any of this will be implemented within this new story.  It would be incredibly disappointing if it wasn’t.,0,0,ilene R,-QPdRfqTnt4,0.09994318181818178,2018-06-13 15:33:24,True,True

Just buy something else and make that into a new film series like Marvel/Star Wars. Stop remaking your own films that didn't need an update. If you want to remake something, remake stuff people didn't like, stuff that is truly out with the times (cough, Song of the South, cough), didn't make a lot of money or you could actually redo (not retreading the same plot). Here are some that you can work with: The Rescuers The Rescuers Down Under The Great Mouse Detective Oliver and Company Home on the Range Chicken Little Brother Bear Treasure Planet ...most importantly THE BLACK CAULDRON   Work on those before you remake Snow White, Bambi, Lion King, and Pinocchio.

2018-06-13T20:44:50,"Roses are red Violets are blue I can't make an original comment and neither can you        Hi, I'm TakeTheJurny, just a fellow small Youtuber with a *big dream* >_< I can't explain how much this means to me that you are giving me your time just to read this comment, and I know you probably are ready to go see a different video or maybe just look at your phone but, it really does mean a lot, because in our society time is very precious. So thanks for reading. Now that I've got your full attention. *M-MHM( I have worked very hard on my Youtube but I fear that the new rules and regulations and the terrible ""adpocalypse"" are going to be hard to surpass by taking the classic ""Make a viral video"" seems. So I have decided to comment here, on a viral trending video, and yes some may say this is advertising, and perhaps it is but please, hear me out. Right now there are 29,726 comments on this video. If every single person that commented on this video saw this comment and took a look at my channel and subscribed literally my dreams would come TRUE!!!! I mean, think about that for a second, we all, working together could make MY DREAMS COME TRUE! and I'm not even asking everyone to subscribe because I only want people who truly enjoy my work to sub, and I'm perfectly fine with that! I'm just trying to find the fastest and easiest way to give everyone a chance to see my work and enjoy it, as well as better my chances for growing as a Youtuber! Now let me rephrase my dream, just so you truly understand my goal...(also thanks so much for still reading!).   *FLASHBACK NARRATION SCENE OF ME AS A LITTLE KID*  I had a rough childhood. My father hurt me and my mom for 13 crappy years, crazy right? It finally shook my mom and she left, but I loved my dad still so much I stayed even though it totally sucked because he'd constantly hurt me, and I don't want to get too detailed because, well, kids might be reading-- anyways, that plus I was always outcasted from my classmates in school and I was pretty much stuck watching Netflix and eating to have fun at the time. It was always hard for me to see the bright side of things and I was losing hope as I sunk deep in to a sort of young depression. That is until I found something.. So I had never really watched Youtube at the time and I thought it was kind of boring tbh. But I was crying that day and looking for enjoyment. Then it was on the screen. ""Markiplier's Let's Play Slender The Arrival!"" I was so excited because *I LOVED* Slenderman so much, so with that in mind I clicked, not knowing what was to happen...but what would happen, would change my life forever. *(Hey just another thumbs up for still reading!! I know it's a lot sorry!!).*   As I watched Markiplier, as I listened to his positive glow and saw his bright booming smile as he squealed at different things about the game. I noticed something starting to change. I had stopped crying. I was also now smiling, focused and laughing at the video! Ever since then I kept watching his videos *WHENEVER* I was down, or sad or unhappy. His videos never failed to lift me up and cleanse me of my darkness. As he wandered down dark corners bravely, I wandered with him. Like a family. I wanted to share this feeling of happiness. This feeling of peace even in chaos! I wanted anyone like me to see this so that they would be happy too, so that we could all be positive and for once have some sort of universal truth of peace and a wonderful family. I want to do what he does. I want to make YOU smile when no one else is. YOU laugh on a bad day. and YOU can be my family when yours isn't there for you. *(SORRY I'LL HURRY THIS UP! Dang you still reading? wow!)*   So, my dream is to be what Markiplier was to me. A light in a person's darkness. I just want to make everyone laugh and bring everyone together. So that's why I made my Youtube. *TakeTheJurny,* because life is a Journey. Now I just want to say that this is not spam, this is a choice. No one has to sub I just wanted everyone to have a chance to see my Youtube before it hits 1million, and that will happen one day :) thanks for reading, and as always I will see you, when I heed the call, to the next Journey, Adios guys! <3 and thanks so much for reading!",2,5,TakeTheJurny,-QPdRfqTnt4,0.1220847209808762,2018-06-13 20:44:50,True,True

The circus setting is perfect for him to express his unique style, alot of colours, can even make it a bit gothic/scary/creepy (an aura not to uncommon from a circus enviroment) And, he's no stranger to make movies about outcast that doesn't fit in/try to find their place etc. That is basicly what he does!

IN THIS REALM WE CALL EARTH!!!  ARE THOSE HUMANS AND WHY ARE THEY HERE? Dumbo was perfectly fine with lack of human presence what's the point of just throwing in a bunch human main characters out of nowhere? 4) the Beauty and the Beast remake might have worked for me but I just don't see this one working. The original Dumbo has a very touching, emotional charm and feeling that just wouldn't be the the same away from hand-drawn 2d animation  HOWEVER: If you are brave enough to somehow add in the crows, who are NOT as racist as people think they are, then I'll be more willing to give this movie a shot",1,1,Corner Click,-QPdRfqTnt4,0.24305555555555555,2018-06-13 22:41:10,True,True

I have no plans to see the remake of The Lion King because for one the villain song Be Prepared will not even be in it.  Another is the remake of Mulan where do I begin with this one. 1) The character of Captain Li Shang will not even be in the film. 2) Mushu is not going to be in the film. 3) None of the great songs are going to be in it so no :”Reflection”, “I’ll Make a Man Out of You”, “Honor to us All”, “Girl Worth Fighting for” and no “True to Your Heart”. 4) Mulan will not even be fighting the Huns but a witch. 5)There is going to be a new male character that is not going to like her male persona, but once that one finds out that he is actually a she will like her!  So far I have seen the Alice in Wonderland remake which was awful-Added logic to a world that doesn’t need logic, Johnny Depp was horrible as the Mad Hatter Ed Wynn is spectacular, that stupid cliché of “The Chosen One” to save the day, along with several other things,   I despise with a passion the remake called Maleficent it completely ruins the character and story.

A REAL LIFE-LOOKING elephant flying isn't the same as a CARTOON, fictional, elephant flying. It's like Tom and Jerry, not quiet but bare with me. Tom and Jerry is a FANTASTIC cartoon. Now imagine a real cat and real mouse chasing eachother around with frying pans, jumping off of buildings and doing other weird, and random stuff in real life. It turns the laughable, memorable show that I still love into a nightmarish landscape. That's what creating this movie will do. It'll ruin the OG memories. I know lots of you will call me things such as, ""You're a hater"" or ""Stop being a bad sport and stop ruining this movie for others."" I know it hasn't even come out and there isn't much to go on, but imagine a DRUNK elephant floating and going on a acid trip in real life. That's a scary thought. Call me whatever you want.

I can picture it now:  John and Jane Doe are in a boat on a quiet, calm creek. It's early morning and the fog had rolled in... John's slowly paddling the boat, preserving the tranquillity. Calm, Quiet, Peace... But then Jane hears a distant noise. Faint, but quiet. She can't tell what the noise is, but she assumes it's just another of the many fisher birds they had observed on their voyage... Then she heards it again. It's still faint, but louder. It sounded as though it was just around the bend. She mumbles to herself of this obsevation to which John notices. He's been so immersed in the rhythmic paddling, and the melodic sounds of nature that he hasn't notice the dynamic shift. He gives her a puzzled look to signal his inquiry while maintaining the silence, the peace, that calm. Jane gives John a shrug and goes back to basking in nature's soft, docile tones; the water lapping, river brush swaying, the rustling leaves... Jane and John bask in their solidary sanctuary. Fully engrossing themselves in their moments together... John opens his eyes Jane is gone All that remains is her Sunday hat perched gently on her seat John stares at the hat, not fullying understanding what his eyes were telling him Then it clicks. The comprehension of what occured widens his lazily closed eyes to a panic He whips his head to his left. Then his right His heart begins to beat faster as his world becomes smaller and shallower He frantically searches up and down to only meet with failed expections In the water, in the river brush, in the rustling leaves all leave no trace of Jane He stares back at the hat with desperate, hopeful stares and stares at the perfectly placed hat sitting in her seat The bend nears and John looks behind him to guide around the creek's curve The trumpet sounds and with a gentle swoosh, John's disappeared.

The cute but amazing looking animation of the original allowed for the delivery of some comedic moments for the whole family while delivering a touching story about an elephant wishing to reunite with its mother. With this, it seems they think the reason everybody like the original was ONLY for the fact that dumbo wanted to get back with its mom, so this movie will probably in the serious side and will probably be an absolute bore. I'm not trying to take anywhing away from people that are excited for this movie though. If you think you can enjoy this forgettable looking movie (like beauty and the beast) then congrats.

Second if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you Know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking misses at Gru, he then dodge them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed.   Plus after this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine.

2018-06-15T05:02:24,"So much about the trailer that rubs me wrong. Why the supportive human aspect??? Dumbo is about DUMBO overcoming judgement, bullying and learning to live with and use how he was different as a strength and not a weakness. The original didn't need some little girl or boy petting on him and saying ""you can do it"". If any thing the original used humans as the crueler part of the story. Packing them into tight train cars and dragging them around the country, separating him from his mother and using him for profit by extorting him to show off his big ears for everyone to laugh at and painting him up as a clown and making him do dangerous stunts. Dumbo taught me that people are cruel, the world is cruel, that there are friends to be had you would never expect to have, that you have to see your differences as a strength, to have confidence in your self and to cherish the bond with your mother. If this movie does any thing different from that they're doing it wrong!",0,0,Joshua Santana,-QPdRfqTnt4,-0.1296886936592819,2018-06-15 05:02:24,True,True

2018-06-15T06:24:43,"Roses are red  Violets are blue  I can't make an original comment  and neither can you                Hi, I'm TakeTheJurny, just a fellow small Youtuber with a *big dream* >_<  I can't explain how much this means to me that you are giving me your time just to read this comment, and I know you probably are ready to go see a different video or maybe just look at your phone but, it really does mean a lot, because in our society time is very precious. So thanks for reading. Now that I've got your full attention. *M-MHM( I have worked very hard on my Youtube but I fear that the new rules and regulations and the terrible ""adpocalypse"" are going to be hard to surpass by taking the classic ""Make a viral video"" seems. So I have decided to comment here, on a viral trending video, and yes some may say this is advertising, and perhaps it is but please, hear me out. Right now there are 29,726 comments on this video. If every single person that commented on this video saw this comment and took a look at my channel and subscribed literally my dreams would come TRUE!!!! I mean, think about that for a second, we all, working together could make MY DREAMS COME TRUE! and I'm not even asking everyone to subscribe because I only want people who truly enjoy my work to sub, and I'm perfectly fine with that! I'm just trying to find the fastest and easiest way to give everyone a chance to see my work and enjoy it, as well as better my chances for growing as a Youtuber! Now let me rephrase my dream, just so you truly understand my goal...(also thanks so much for still reading!).     *FLASHBACK NARRATION SCENE OF ME AS A LITTLE KID*  I had a rough childhood. My father hurt me and my mom for 13 crappy years, crazy right? It finally shook my mom and she left, but I loved my dad still so much I stayed even though it totally sucked because he'd constantly hurt me, and I don't want to get too detailed because, well, kids might be reading-- anyways, that plus I was always outcasted from my classmates in school and I was pretty much stuck watching Netflix and eating to have fun at the time. It was always hard for me to see the bright side of things and I was losing hope as I sunk deep in to a sort of young depression. That is until I found something.. So I had never really watched Youtube at the time and I thought it was kind of boring tbh. But I was crying that day and looking for enjoyment. Then it was on the screen. ""Markiplier's Let's Play Slender The Arrival!"" I was so excited because *I LOVED* Slenderman so much, so with that in mind I clicked, not knowing what was to happen...but what would happen, would change my life forever. *(Hey just another thumbs up for still reading!! I know it's a lot sorry!!).*     As I watched Markiplier, as I listened to his positive glow and saw his bright booming smile as he squealed at different things about the game. I noticed something starting to change. I had stopped crying. I was also now smiling, focused and laughing at the video! Ever since then I kept watching his videos *WHENEVER* I was down, or sad or unhappy. His videos never failed to lift me up and cleanse me of my darkness. As he wandered down dark corners bravely, I wandered with him. Like a family. I wanted to share this feeling of happiness. This feeling of peace even in chaos! I wanted anyone like me to see this so that they would be happy too, so that we could all be positive and for once have some sort of universal truth of peace and a wonderful family. I want to do what he does. I want to make YOU smile when no one else is. YOU laugh on a bad day. and YOU can be my family when yours isn't there for you. *(SORRY I'LL HURRY THIS UP! Dang you still reading? wow!)*     So, my dream is to be what Markiplier was to me. A light in a person's darkness. I just want to make everyone laugh and bring everyone together. So that's why I made my Youtube. *TakeTheJurny,* because life is a Journey. Now I just want to say that this is not spam, this is a choice. No one has to sub I just wanted everyone to have a chance to see my Youtube before it hits 1million, and that will happen one day :) thanks for reading, and as always I will see you, when I heed the call, to the next Journey, Adios guys! <3 and thanks so much for reading! x3",1,0,TakeTheJurny,-QPdRfqTnt4,0.1220847209808762,2018-06-15 06:24:43,True,True

It would be cool if Disney's casting department could actually introduce good talent into the world for projects like this. Instead they spend way too much on established talent that doesn't really sell the film in the end. They are selling you on the actors not the story.  If I see this its because Michael Keaton, Danny Devito etc..  A good story will stand on its own merit. Throwing a bunch of established actors into the project isnt going to save it...

2018-06-17T00:30:28,I WAS excited for the trailer but now I'm not just because of these things I'll list.  1. I'll bet the movie will focus on the kids most of the time.  2. If the elephants or just any animal in general doesn't talk then I'm going to be rather pissed because it'll just be boring.  3. I'm pretty sure they won't bring back the Crows just because of SJW and Black Lives Matter (And just the fact Disney is very Liberal) But if they don't put the Goddamn Mouse in the movie I'm not watching it. I'd rather watch the animated one that I grew up with.

2018-06-18T16:09:49,"While I enjoy Tim Burtons style, this movie already exist. There is no reason to make this movie to, as the trailer implies, make humans more sentral.   I fear some of the best scenes from the original (1941) will lose their impact with humans around Dumbo. One of the most important scenes in the movie, when Dumbo's mum is imprisoned, is so impactful since Dumbo had noone else. everyone else made fun of him and shun away from him. Taking away his mother left him alone. In this movie, it seems he will have others around him who likes him. This takes away from their separation. Sure, in the original he then meets Timothy Mouse, but before that introduction Dumbo is all alone. And after meeting Timothy, he still only have one friend in the whole world.   These live action Disney movies are ultimatly just attempts at milking the movies for nostalgia, by retelling a story that Disney themselves already have made a good/great/perfect version of already. I have not seen any of the new live action movies, will not see them and if I am ever going to see the stories, by myself or with kids or friends, I will put on the animated once, which just seems to be better in every way.",0,0,Trygve Prestø,-QPdRfqTnt4,0.3143939393939394,2018-06-18 16:09:49,True,True

I don’t mind the CGI, I understand that’s where animation is going, but why can’t they do an original story? Disney has truly lost the magic it once had. I watched the new “The Jungle Book” movie and it just didn’t have the same heart. By all means it wasn’t a bad movie, but do we really need another Disney “The Jungle Book”? There’s so many other stories out there that could make great films. These live action remakes just seem like cheap cash-grabs with little thought put into them.

""James! You should watch dumbo instead! Its much better than this!"" I replied with ""no thanks i think its a little boring nan nan"" The next moments of my life i will never understand to this day... She looks at me with furious intent and grabs me by the arm, turns me around and spanks me, and while holding my arm leading me to the back bathroom in the store she throws me in and yells ""STAY IN THERE UNTIL YOU LEARN TO APPRECIATE MY MOVIES!!!!"" me being in the bathroom crying my eyes out, i hear her outside crying as well and praying saying.""Dear god please forgive this boy"" and starts to sing that baby mine don't you cry from the movie.

2018-06-28T12:25:18,"Not really won over by Tim Burton to be honest. Most of his remakes struggle to impress, and Dumbo is a film that you’ve gotta get right. It’s one of Disney’s all time classics, it’s Walt’s personal favourite film so remaking it is a tall order.   My first impression of this is that the focus is wrong. The original Dumbo had no sympathetic human characters in it at all. Dumbo was an outcast from a society that mocked you for being different. It seems like there’s a big focus on human characters in this movie, but the original stuck primarily with the animals. I shouldn’t be thinking ‘oh look it’s Colin Farrell, Johnny Depp, Eva Green and Danny DeVito in a movie about a flying elephant.’  I’m not saying I’m against new ideas or new angles or whatever, but sometimes you got to get the ‘soul’ of a movie right, and looking at how Tim did Alice in Wonderland or Charlie and the Chocolate factory, I don’t think he does get it right. This trailer, for instance, feels like it’s trying to sell me moulin rouge, not Dumbo. That’s already suggesting the films tone is already a bit off.  Some of you might be excited, and I respect that, but I just wanted to voice my concerns.",0,0,TachyonKing,-QPdRfqTnt4,0.14070810142238713,2018-06-28 12:25:18,True,True

2018-06-30T00:03:51,"I'm upset with all your Anti-anti-male film work.  I loved so many Disney movies in the past but you are loosing track of the point of story telling.  It's about the story. A plot. Good acting.  Below par acting and the lack of a plot make a bad movie. A movie can't stand on special effects alone. Stephen Spielberg is a great example of this type of movie. Jurassic Park.  Ugh...... Good for kids I suppose.  No leading up to anything just bam! It's done. It was disappointing. Could have been great. Remember this? you never talk about Religion or politics if you want to keep your friends. Well it's true in the movies also. If your main goal is to make a political statement and shove your own views down our throats then you are doing a great job on Star Wars. However if you want people to pay to see them then you are breaking a cardinal rule, no religion or politics. As a White Man I am offended and disappointed in your behavior, social justice Warriors that you are clearly in bed with hold up signs to kill all White men! And when I watch your movies I see just that! Ugh....... If you are going to be Racist then I can no longer take my family to watch any of your films. If you think old white men need to leave America then I can't endorse you any longer. Your goal is to make sjw's happy instead of family. Social justice Warriors are Racist and filled with hate and anger. Disney the new Racist 2018. That is how you are being seen. Stop worrying about racism and political views and just tell a good story and hire the right actor for the job based on ability not color or gender. Pointing it out is just as bad as the other side.

He's extremely kind in person, and always goes out of his way to make his guests feel comfortable. I'm not sure if this comes across very clearly when judging him exclusively based on his on-screen persona. This aspect of his personality is difficult to convey, because he's highly introverted. Since I know him personally - I can assure you that he's exceptionally friendly and generous. He expresses all the correct, mandatory political views. His children briefly attended public school, even though they live next to the Hammer Museum on Wilshire Blvd. He convincingly eats lower class foods like American cheese, ""Wonder Bread"", and ""Big Mac"". His wife uses Sephora make-up without complaint, and never overspends for professional cosmetics (because they're typically gifted). Dumbo is one of my closest friends, and I hope you really enjoy his new movie. He worked really hard on it. One time we ate lunch at Pace Joint on Sunset, and he made the reservation FOR me. I hope that puts things in perspective. I really admire Dumbo, and his new movie is excellent. I have a screener, and promise you that it doesn't disappoint.

2018-11-20T02:44:13,"I'm not excited about this movie because I don't think Jumbo, Jr. (that's Dumbo) is magic because there's nothing great about him on the other side of the flight. Thus, he's not educational, he's not protective, he's not intelligent, he's not adventurous, he's not epic, he's not powerful, he's not wholesome, he's not amazing, he's not creative enough, and he's not even peaceful, next to his film. All he does is sit around, crying while staying quiet. Not saying anything at all.All I like about the film is when his mom got arrested by the circus people when she was trying to protect him and got locked up in a wagon far away from the circus. With that, Jumbo is a stupid cartoon. A really stupid, careless cartoon just like all of the cartoons and other films in our world. And let's talk about the name. ""Bambi? Isn't that a girl's name?"" someone said. Well, ""Dumbo? Isn't that an insult?"" Why do you want to call a majestic mammal who can fly, compared to his own kind, dumb? That's so ugly and stupid. I'm impressed that an elephant, such as Jumbo, can fly, but why do you want to call him dumb? That's the major problem about Disney and other productions- every time they make a character that can fly, they always make them dumb, mean, evil, tortured, mistreated, disrespected, too violent, insecure, weak, annoying, or incompetent. Never intelligent, nice, competent, strong, educational, protective to the minds, powerful, wholesome, dependable, or peaceful. I know Dumbo is not the elephant's real name. It's Jumbo, Jr. Still, why don't people give him a nickname that is more appropriate, like Greato or Brillton or Amazo or Liondon or Eago or Falco or Prodox or Kingod. However, I am curious about this movie the same as you, guys, and I would like to see it even though Jumbo, Jr. is a terrible mess and this live-action version might be worse than the original. I like Jumbo, Jr. a little, but I'm still not excited about his live-action version.",1,1,Jarvis Carr,-QPdRfqTnt4,-0.05631944444444445,2018-11-20 02:44:13,True,True

As with The Nutcracker and the Four Realms last November, Dumbo truly soared in the moments where viewers could sense its beautiful circus atmosphere, and it stands out as a gorgeous film. In terms of other Disney live-action reboots, I appreciate the way that Tim Burton created his typical pretty-but-creepy vibe, but Dumbo needed more musical touches to rank among the likenesses of Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast. At the end of the day, Dumbo was charming enough to keep me intrigued, but I wish that I could have felt more connection to the characters in order for the high-stakes moments to be more suspenseful...
