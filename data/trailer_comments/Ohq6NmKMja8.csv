Ice Age 3 = Liked it better than the second, well Buck was the redeeming character of the movie and lots of fun, exploring the dinosaur world was fun, and had a really good ending for our heroes. Unnecessary, but not terrible. Ice Age 4 = Could someone take a sledgehammer to that film? It was annoying, predictable, did Manny go out of character a few times?, and Wanda Sykes, what are you doing there being the most obnoxious character? You're better than that.  Ice Age 5 = I'll just keep quiet until it actually comes out. (mutters) Still don't like that it's going on!",0,0,joyunicycle,Ohq6NmKMja8,0.2626165501165501,2016-02-16 02:36:00,True,True
2016-02-16T10:18:58,"Who votes that the Ice Age movies should conclude? I mean, the Shrek movies ended in four movies, perhaps it could've ended better in a trilogy, that's my opinion. An important factor I must mention is that Shrek could've been cash-cowed further if it hadn't ended But in the case of Ice Age and other franchises possibly and obviously being continuously milked for all its worth. Of course, as we should all know, this is business, and just as it is in life, we make difficult and reluctant decisions on how certain things in life must be run and managed. In this case, for 20th Century Fox and subsidiary animation studio Blue Sky, the former media distributor calls the shots like a boss and chooses what creative media work titles and teams will do a certainty of these works as either original, sequel, prequel, or spin-off titles. It's like your publisher or or whatever media distribution/production company wants you to continue writing your book or whatever media series or franchise because they're the bosses running the operations in spite of the works belonging to the original creators. And I fear that as a creative artist, there would be nothing any of us or them could do about it because it is their jobs they'd be risking in the first place, though I would hope that I'm wrong. Pardon this speech-written comment being long and wordy.The way the writers and producers are going with the series' stories is just . . . just . . . juuuuuuusssssttt, hmmmmmmmm, bland, yeah, that's the word I'm looking for, bland, lukewarm, unoriginal, and sometimes cringe-worthy and making audiences and fans shake their heads. I'm shaking my head even now (though only in my mind). The first three movies, they're alright, but sailing out to the Seven Seas and encountering and confronting pirates during the continental drift, now a meteor shower caused by some exploding prehistoric alien ship that Scrat had ridden on exploding or just bonked on some asteroids and meteors sending them plummeting down the earth and obviously wipe out the prehistoric animals of the Ice Age world (along with some blends of modern popular culture of OUR time in THEIR time, like Manny playing makeshift ice hockey like the animals invented it first than humankind). I feel the team's creative writing and ideas are not strictly on the plane of originality. I predict we might get tired of the franchise soon with the direction it is going, even as it is now, so my main point here is, this thing must be laid to rest. No, better yet, it must retire. The so-called Herd (nah, I'll take ""so-called"" out, it's THE Herd) in the Ice Age movies have done their part, told their stories for laughs, tears, and smiles, and their saga needs to end, and I mean THEY.

Sadly, this is a movie I'll most likely end up renting instead of watching at theaters.   Ive loved a pair of Blue Sky movies- but then the second and third movies come in.

2016-03-02T23:42:36,"I get why all of these comments have to do with that after the first and/or second of Ice Age, it seemed to be the rest are unecessary. But on other words, I seemed to enjoy all of the movies of the Ice Age franchise. Yes, I had to admit it was dumb, but come on you can't forget that the creators have people who look foward to this and love the series too. Think of it like the Fast & Furious franchise (which I'm a big fan of), the first movie was great, the second one was also great too. And then the rest keeps getting bizarre and overexaggerting with its special effects. But keep in mind that as fhe years go by for movie franchises, directors and creators want to make it bigger and better, that's what they want! That's what they love so they can try to make others who are fans of their work excited and have an eager feeling to see the movie. It's not a bad thing for what you all comment because I can understand it all. But we all have opinions right? Just know that I'm stating out there of my own opinions and letting others know what may be the reason or so to why films are little bit more highly crazy like they're not recommended these days. If you argue for a 5th movie in the Ice Age franchise, then don't go see the movie and judge, knowing that it may as well be dumb anyways. But if you're not sure about it, try and go this summer to take approximately 2 hours watching it and if you didn't like it, that's fine, at least you saw the movie. If you're pumped up for it, go for it and enjoy it with your family and friends.

2016-08-13T13:54:42,"Let me give my personal opinion. I first watched Ice Age and i adored it. The animation really gave me a winter feeling, the characters, especially Manny, got really deep sometimes. Even the designs of the other creatures and backgrounds were tremendous and the soundtrack was exactly what it needed to be for a wacky fun family movie. And even the 2nd movie was VERY very very good. The soundtrack was the best part in my opinion, the animation got sharper and more detailed and the plot with a meltdown and even two prehistoric reptiles, being the enbodyment of the danger in their world, could get scary sometimes. And even the little songs like ""Food, Glorious Food"" could get me laughing out loud. But sadly the 3rd one kinda seemed like a Jurassic Park rip off, although Buck was a very good character and still one of the best. They kept adding new characters to ""refresh"" the story and unlike adding Ellie for a example, this didn't work. It has entirely lost it's magic and that is such a shame really. And the moments that can get a little bit emotional like¬†with Diego and Shira are overshadowed by the lame jokes.¬†And this line from a review of this from IMDb proves what the audience for this franchise has become: ""Before I begin this review, let me state that I have IBS. For those of you who do not know, IBS stands for Irritable bowel syndrome. This diagnosis causes me to have very impulsive, and often inexcusable bathroom troubles."" ¬†Go watch the 1st and 2nd movie if you really want that Ice Age feeling again, that's my advice.",5,0,This Guy,Ohq6NmKMja8,0.1820499108734403,2016-08-13 13:54:42,False,True
