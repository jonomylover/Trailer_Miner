2016-07-04T04:30:45,Okay for those wondering about why Jonah hill is fat again think about it in 21 and 22 jump street he had to play a shy nerd kid with no confidence so he went skinny to show a skinny twerp kid who has no confidence unlike Superbad where he was playing a douchey asshole fat teen lolz so whenever he has to play a douchey confident or just a loud person then fat Jonah hill makes that work makes it more believable. Think about it the skinny guy from 21 jump street being an arms dealer bossing people around wouldn't really make sense since you would just be reminded of the shy nerd not like Donny from wolf of Wall Street.,6,4,Frankie Vids,dKYaEPdcV1g,0.14444444444444446,2016-07-04 04:30:45,True,True
