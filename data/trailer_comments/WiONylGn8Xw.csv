DBZ has never been that logical I know, but I do still hope they give a good reason for not finishing him off early, because the power differences at this point should be pretty ridiculous even if you don't give a shit about power levels.  And do they really have to give Goku a new form again? The more forms you introduce, the more redundant each form becomes. And I wish they at least did something more interesting with them than just change the color of Goku's hair. Of course like I said, I haven't seen the film so I don't know the full details, but I just don't want it to be a blue SSG. I guess SSG sorta goes with the common DBZ theme of looks being deceiving, like how Frieza's final form is perhaps his least scary looking, but it's still a boring transformation imo(SSG). Another thing is that I wish they'd let someone other than Goku be the hero for once. But once again I haven't seen the film so this is just me judging based on the trailer.

Z tried to keep coherent at least - this one looks like battle of the gods where GT logic is used - Goku becomes stronger for no reason (anger for ssj1 and intense training at least for 2 & 3 which was unattainable by anyone else unfused which would make sense cause all he did was train in heaven).  if its anything like Battle of the Gods, def not excited for this 1  /endrant",0,0,wraithryder,WiONylGn8Xw,0.17312500000000003,2015-06-29 07:19:24,True,True

2015-07-09T23:56:54,"Just watched the movie in Spanish since I couldn't find English or any version with subtitles. I thought it was awesome, if mildly short, but I do have a few questions. If someone could explain these to me, I'd appreciate it:  1. Where were Goten and Trunks during all of this? I noticed Yamcha was absent too, was he babysitting them or something? Even if they didn't know what was happening, wouldn't they have sensed Frieza's evil energy and wanted to help?   2. Gohan has unlocked his ultimate potential, which makes him stronger than SS 3 Gotenks, and he can go super saiyan on top of that, yet Frieza knocked him out easily in his first form? Does that make Goku in his base form, who Frieza couldn't beat in his third transformation, stronger than Ultimate Gohan and SS3 now?  3. If Goku and Vegeta's training allowed them to achieve a super saiyan form boosted by SS God power, is it reasonable to think they could gain that boost for SS 2 and 3 also? Would they eventually become stronger than Beerus or Whis at that point?  4. If Cooler (who I know is not canon) or King Cold trained themselves, could they unlock a new form like Frieza? Or did Cooler already do that in getting his fourth form? If so, why was he still so much weaker than Golden Frieza that Goku killed him as a regular super saiyan? I get that Frieza's a prodigy in his family, but that is a huge power gap.",0,0,Keith,WiONylGn8Xw,0.06229603729603729,2015-07-09 23:56:54,True,True

What I wanted to see.. and i'm sure many others did too, is actually slightly grotesque but almost essential I believe in terms of revenge.  I didn't just want Vegeta to beat Frieza about a bit  I wanted to see the single most gruesome one sided beat down, i'm talking Frieza screaming in pain, limbs removed, begging for death, blood pouring out of his eyes.  This might sound over the top and sick in the head but I think it would have been essential for character development as it would almost conclude the transformation of Vegetas character.  Frieza made Vegeta what he was, the murderer, the planet conquering Saiyan prince always living in fear, in the shadows, miserable, fatherless, without his own people and even without his own planet, enslaved essentially from a child. Vegeta is a warrior and always would have been but the evil that he was? That was Friezas doing. He made him into the genocidal maniac we saw destroying Namekian children.  If Vegeta had given Frieza the grotesque death he deserved it would have been the ultimate irony and full circle of character development. The being that made him evil and destroyed his existence in this universe- subjecting him previously to a torturous death of his own, now begging for his life, obliterated at the hands of the monster he created would be the ultimate poetic justice, and in my opinion and almost essential final moment of Vegeta letting go of his horrific tortured past. One final flicker of the evil Vegeta held onto, brought back to life for one final assault to finally end his torment at the hands of his tormentor.  This needed to be far more brutal than it was- I hope people understand where I'm coming from.",0,0,M,WiONylGn8Xw,-0.14449855699855702,2015-07-15 00:48:15,True,True

This is a challenge for the Z fighters (for some stupid reason even though Goku, before this whole stupid Saiyan God crap. Should be able to kick Frieza's ass even if he transforms another level since Goku is three levels above where he was last time they fought, Super Saiyan 3) Then it looks as though Goku and the gang is on the ropes but they pull a victory out without any significant Z fighter getting injured or killed.  Idk why they bought this show back just to crush the characters we once loved and make a mockery out of them.

Despite only being told through legend, Frieza, who was considered to be the strongest being of his time, became paranoid over the possibility of truth behind the legend due to the constantly growing power of the Saiyan race. Because of this fear, Frieza came to the conclusion that he must annihilate the Saiyan race by destroying Planet Vegeta,[20] thus apparently sparking the end of the Super Saiyan legend. However, twenty-five years later, the Super Saiyan legend was proven to be true when Goku accomplished the feat during his titanic battle against the evil tyrant, Frieza.[21]",0,0,Denisse Guzman,WiONylGn8Xw,0.0442708333333333,2015-07-30 14:45:56,False,True

I like Dbz but I don't really get why people like it pass the cell saga. I mean for me it was bearable at best. I just feel so depressed. I really want a movie about the old Dragon ball. Make a realistic man pig out of Oolong. And for the sake of God a villan equal to the purple dog dude in the recent Japanese battle of Gods.
