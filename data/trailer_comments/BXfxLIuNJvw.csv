The world certainly doesn't need Disney to come along and genericize the story to try and wring some more cash out of a beloved cultural institution. Second, including black actors in a thoroughly European story where all the characters in the original E.T.A. Hoffman story were white is tantamount to blackwashing.  You wouldn't cast white actors in a Japanese tale set in the 19th century, and just so for both historical and cultural reasons you don't cast black people to play white roles. How the media thinks it's wrong for a white actor like ScarJo to portray an Asian character in Ghost in the Shell, yet advocates that it's fair for a black actor like Idris Elba to portray a white character like James Bond, is beyond me.

2018-09-07T18:25:56,"The movie just looks aweful. I have nothing about who you want to cast in the roles. The great thing about these stories is that they're supposed to be timeless, adaptable to any demographic, and appeal to any audience. But if you're going to try to update the story and make it more accessible, why not keep the plot intact, except have it occur in a modern household with modern dialogue? You could make everyone native to the Four Realms have the archaic speech pattern if you want. That'd be much more relevant for today's kids, who are most likely going to be familiar with the Ballet storyline and can't relate to this type of Victorian setting. I am disappointed by their marketing and the political/social tones. One subtle example being how Godfather Droselmeyer is no longer the creator of the Nutcracker, but now it's Clara's mom. Ironically, this actually weakens Clara's personal journey, since in the story I and the general pop culture is familiar with, she earns the position as princess after aiding the Nutcracker in his battle against the Mouse King. Jetlag Films made an adaptation of the story that shows a strong yet faithful female lead (I can't remember the name they used, but for simplicity and comparison, I'm going to use Clara.) The first time the two duel, the Nutcracker loses, and would have been killed had Clara not thrown her shoe at the king. Now the Nutcracker is defenseless, and in order to save him from being devoured by the Mouse King, Clara selflessly trades her possessions. Clara then provides the Nutcracker with a new sword and Clara's own sacrifices motivate him to defeat the Mouse King even more than ever, allowing the Nutcracker to win the rematch. It's Clara's actions and personality that earn her the Nutcracker Prince's love. That's a great role model for young girls. It's why I and so many other love women like Ariel, Bell, and Mulan. They earn their happy endings in spite of the challenges they face, and they don't have to be the ""save [insert generic kingdom] and fight a war"" storyline, which to be blunt, does not match the Nutcracker storyline. Luke Skywalker and Batman are male leads who, like their female counterparts, are strong not because they can lead others into battle or maneuver political situations, but because they are human people doing the right thing for a noble cause, and they will never give up on that. What could be a better message to share with kids? Clara should be a strong female character without taking screentime, importance, or narrative focus away from the other characters. There's zero focus on the Nutcracker, Mouseking, or any male figures in this new film. It's called the Nutcracker. If you want the focus to be so heavy on Clara, then call it Clara and the Four Realms.",9,1,Victor Jechart,BXfxLIuNJvw,0.21146058802308806,2018-09-07 18:25:56,True,True

I don't know if its because people are losing their taste in animation. Its sad that not many people these days would love to remain children.

2018-10-12T18:01:00,"The plot of this from what I can see looks far too similar to Burton's Alice in Wonderland remake. Female protagonist gets swept into a magical but slightly sinister world and has to gear up to fight the villain as fortold by some prophecy or something similar. The characters even mirror those in Alice in Wonderland, Clara is Alice, the godfather is the caterpillar, Mother Ginger is the Queen of Hearts and the fairy is that other queen. I hope it's not going to be similar to that film but either way, this film doesn't look great to be honest, there's nothing to show it might have a streak of brilliance or be particularly unique, it just looks very standard for Disney's latest live actions. I hope it surprises me though cause I really want Disney to try and make more original live action films rather than carbon copies of their animated ones. I know this isn't completely original but it does seem to diverge a lot from the original ballet. Seriously Disney, stop with the live action remakes of your animated classics. The animated versions are the ones we're going to remember and love and probably show our children, not the live action remakes. You're not putting out any new morals, messages or themes because of them, just repeats of the same plots and morals from before but without the charm of traditional animation.",0,0,J Green,BXfxLIuNJvw,0.1741161616161616,2018-10-12 18:01:00,True,True

2018-10-26T04:16:35,"Reading the commentaries made me really sad; made me lose all hope in people and their potential hability to pick up a book or use google before judging something. First of all, the nutcraker it's not a russian story, it's german, written by E.T.A Hoffman in 1816 (the ballet was composed by Tchaikovsky in 1892). the names Stahlbaum and Drosselmeyer should give you a clue (the last one is Morgan Freeman's character). Speaking of that, secondly, really people? talking nonsense about black people being cast? This is not the first time this has been done, before this movie there were The Hot Chocolate Nutcracker and The Harlem Nutcracker, also, ALSO, between the story of Hoffman in the '16 and Tchaikovsky's ballet in the '92, were an adaptation written by  Alexandre Dumas Sr in 1844  (this retelling being the one adapted later by the composer), and guess what? Alexandre Dumas Sr's father, General Thomas-Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie WAS BLACK! An aristrocratic black french man on the XVIII century of Our Lord; so, if France can have black Generals in 1786, of course Germany can have a black toymaker in 1816. May i add something to this second point: the nutcracker is implied to be Drosselmeyer nephew, so... following my last train of thought, is completely natural for him to be a black boy! And thirdly and finally, SERIOUSLY??!? the nutcracker plot is centered on the eponimous Nutcracker AND on Clara (she saved him from being stabbed, with a effin slipper!, and that is just at the begining, how cool is that?); this is only a trailer and we have yet to see the Nutcracker develoment in this particular story. I don't understand what is so wrong in having a female protagonist, is encouraging, sweet and accurate given that the Nutcracker is a girl's dream ( or not?)  So, i understand if you don't like Disney (because of their empresarial views and practices, or else), but please stop blaming ""PC being gone mad and shoved down to our troats"" for the cynical views and sentiments of modern days and general public.

The original story of and Tchaikovsky's music for The Nutcracker are an important Christmas tradition that, for many of us, goes back decades to our childhood.  Disney risks alienating a large segment of older ticket buyers by screwing it up.  I hope there will be enough of the original mood and story left to make it worth the effort and cost of admission.  I've seen and, on a superficial level, enjoyed it despite important sections of Tchaikovsky's music being completely absent.  I am of Ukrainian blood (yes, Dad's parents emigrated legally) and the film's bastardized version of the story irritates more as I think about it.  This is part of my heritage and, as such, diversity has no place in that context.  This is a folk tale set in Russia, not Harlem, not the deep South nor anywhere else.  Disney's rush to be inclusive is heavy-handed and offensive.   What would happen if they made a film of Gershwin's ""Porgy and Bess"" and used blonde haired, blue eyed Scandinavians in the title roles?  In the name of diversity, of course.

2018-11-04T15:43:26,"....grand ripping off the nutcracker? Guess she will be a new disney princess and change the story to what they want.  Or maybe they might keep it the close to the original would be great cuz I liked the original.  The orginal nutcracker has Clara recieving a nutcracker for Christmas from her Uncle Drosselmeyer, her little brother Fritz thinks the nutcracker is ugly and Clara believes him to be a handsome prince and so Fritz tries to take it from her and he breaks it. Clara then is furious with her brother and runs off to fix it. Later that night when the clock strikes 12 (I think?) Mice come to destroy there Christmas tree and eat all there sweets (I think, this part changes alot) The nutcracker however fights off the mice and Clara awaken becoming far more small then she was and hit the mouse king with her shoe, killing him.  (I think) The nutcracker is thankful (even tho they still look ugly or whatever or he changes in that moment it always changing) and run off the somewhere with the nutcracker (most of this part talks about the sugarplum princess and the snow fairies as well as some sort of bird that flies in the air?.. I dunno stuff gets weird after that) and bam! The nutcracker turns into a prince! (Or it was after the fight with the mice. They tend to move it around sometimes but it always has the same plot) Clara and the nutcracker dance away into the night until she falls asleep and wakes up on Christmas morning! With the nutcracker gone and the prince reappears or something.  Either way it has of plot of  -Clara gets nutcracker -Clara thinks the nutcracker is a prince -The nutcrackers fights the mouse king -nutcracker breaks -Clara k.o's the king with her DAM SHOE -Clara goes off to the see the sugar plum princess and what not -Clara learns that the nutcracker really was a prince -Clara falls asleep and awakens back home on Christmas morning -De end.  If disney does it like this I will watch it cuz the original had an op girl with fricking shoes made out of dumbells I swear this will be the best to watch ever.  But the trailers havent shown the mouse king or even nutcracker form he was supposed to have at first because.. hes cursed from the mouse queen who may or may have not died.(oh yeah theres a mouse queen that die from cursing the prince the nutcracker which makes drosselmeyer even more creepy and odd because hes kind of.. not very uncle like then",5,0,Vivixel - Drawings,BXfxLIuNJvw,0.12330851619644725,2018-11-04 15:43:26,False,True

All the rest of the main characters are white.  Blackwashing? Really? They've used a little bit of Tchaikovsky's score, a lot of CGI, made Keira Knightley talk in a silly voice, and ""updated"" the beloved German story (not Russian) so that it will barely be recognisable. I am quite sure I will dislike this as much as the disaster that was Alice in Wonderland. All fireworks but shitty story. So you can blame Disney for many crimes, but blackwashing isn't a thing.   On a last side note: as a white European woman, I couldn't care less what colour skin a main character has. The more diverse the better. Unless you're going for a true historical representation (and lets be honest, Hollywood rarely gives a rat's ass about getting history right) then I think all that counts is how well an actor can carry the role.
