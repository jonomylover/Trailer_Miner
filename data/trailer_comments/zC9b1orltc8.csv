(copia a mano: Timothy Matlack, probablemente)5‚Äã Signatarios 56 delegados del Congreso Continental Ubicaci√≥n versi√≥n manuscrita: Archivos Nacionales borrador: Biblioteca del Congreso [editar datos en Wikidata] La Declaraci√≥n de Independencia de los Estados Unidos de Am√©ricab‚Äã (cuyo t√≠tulo oficial es The unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of America)a‚Äã es un documento redactado por el segundo Congreso Continental ‚Äîen la C√°mara Estatal de Pensilvania (ahora Sal√≥n de la Independencia) en Filadelfia el 4 de julio de 1776‚Äî que proclam√≥ que las Trece Colonias norteamericanasc‚Äã ‚Äîentonces en guerra con el Reino de Gran Breta√±a‚Äî se hab√≠an autodefinido como trece nuevos Estados soberanos e independientes y ya no reconoc√≠an el dominio brit√°nico;11‚Äã en su lugar formaron una nueva naci√≥n: los Estados Unidos. John Adams fue uno de los pol√≠ticos que emprendi√≥ el proceso de independencia, aprobado el 2 de julio por el Congreso en pleno sin oposici√≥n. Un comit√© se encarg√≥ de redactar la declaraci√≥n formal, la cual se present√≥ cuando el Congreso vot√≥ sobre la misma dos d√≠as despu√©s.   Thomas Jefferson fue el autor principal de la Declaraci√≥n. Adams persuadi√≥ al comit√© para que se encomendase a Thomas Jefferson la tarea de dirigir la redacci√≥n del borrador original del documento,12‚Äã que el Congreso edit√≥ para producir la versi√≥n final. La Declaraci√≥n era fundamentalmente una explicaci√≥n formal de por qu√© el Congreso rompi√≥ sus lazos pol√≠ticos con Gran Breta√±a el 2 de julio, m√°s de un a√±o despu√©s del estallido de la Revoluci√≥n estadounidense. Al d√≠a siguiente, Adams escribi√≥ a su esposa Abigail: ¬´El segundo d√≠a de julio de 1776 ser√° la √©poca m√°s memorable en la historia de Am√©rica¬ª.13‚Äã Sin embargo, el D√≠a de la Independencia se celebra dos d√≠as despu√©s, fecha en la que se aprob√≥.  El 4 de julio ‚Äîluego de ratificar el texto‚Äî el Congreso difundi√≥ la Declaraci√≥n en varias formas. Inicialmente fue publicada en el volante de John Dunlap,14‚Äã que era ampliamente distribuido y le√≠do al p√∫blico. La copia original utilizada para esta impresi√≥n se ha perdido y pudo haber estado en manos de Jefferson.15‚Äã El borrador original con las correcciones de Adams y Benjamin Franklin y las notas adicionales de Jefferson sobre los cambios realizados por el Congreso se conserva en la Biblioteca del Congreso. La versi√≥n m√°s conocida de la Declaraci√≥n ‚Äîuna copia firmada que se considera popularmente como el documento oficial‚Äî se exhibe en los Archivos Nacionales en Washington D. C. Esta copia manuscrita fue solicitada por el Congreso el 19 de julio y firmada el 2 de agosto.16‚Äã5‚Äã  El contenido y la interpretaci√≥n de la Declaraci√≥n han sido objeto de mucha investigaci√≥n acad√©mica. Por ejemplo, el documento justificaba la independencia de los Estados Unidos al enumerar los reclamos coloniales contra el rey Jorge III y afirmaba ciertos derechos naturales y legales, incluido el derecho de revoluci√≥n. Una vez cumplida su misi√≥n original de anunciar la independencia, las referencias al texto de la Declaraci√≥n fueron escasas en los a√±os siguientes. Abraham Lincoln la hizo pieza central de su ret√≥rica (como en el discurso de Gettysburg de 1863) y sus pol√≠ticas. Desde entonces, se ha convertido en una conocida reivindicaci√≥n sobre derechos humanos, en particular su segunda oraci√≥n:  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  Sostenemos como evidentes estas verdades: que los hombres son creados iguales; que son dotados por su Creador de ciertos derechos inalienables; que entre estos est√°n la vida, la libertad y la b√∫squeda de la felicidad.  Esta √∫ltima ha sido calificada como ¬´una de las frases m√°s conocidas en el idioma ingl√©s¬ª17‚Äã y que contiene ¬´las palabras m√°s potentes y consecuentes en la historia estadounidense¬ª.18‚Äã El pasaje lleg√≥ a representar un modelo moral que los Estados Unidos deb√≠an esforzarse por cumplir y dicho punto de vista fue promovido notablemente por Lincoln, quien consider√≥ que la Declaraci√≥n era el fundamento de su filosof√≠a pol√≠tica y sostuvo que era una proclamaci√≥n de principios a trav√©s de la cual debe interpretarse la Constituci√≥n de los Estados Unidos.19‚Äã  La Declaraci√≥n de Independencia de los Estados Unidos inspir√≥ muchos otros documentos similares en otros pa√≠ses y sus ideas ganaron adhesi√≥n en los Pa√≠ses Bajos, el Caribe, Hispanoam√©rica, los Balcanes, √Åfrica Occidental y Europa Central en los a√±os anteriores a 1848.20‚Äã Gran Breta√±a no reconoci√≥ la independencia de sus excolonias hasta que la guerra lleg√≥ a un punto muerto.21‚Äã El Tratado de Par√≠s de 1783 puso fin a las hostilidades y consum√≥ la Revoluci√≥n estadounidense.22‚Äã23‚Äã",3,0,DaOrcawhale Studios,zC9b1orltc8,0.2587301587301587,2018-03-22 10:50:33,False,True

Also Paramount did not put any marketing into this like I did not see any advertisements for it other than at the movie theater. I don't know maybe it's supposed to be entertaining to an audience younger than me but I didn't see a lot of kids there there were not a lot of kids there and it doesn't even work for the new kids so shame on that. And they also because this is a sequel they pretend that the first movie continuity doesn't exist they just said screw this and I'm not joking do not watch this movie if you want to see good kids movies go watch the new Peter rabbit movie go watch Paddington 2 The final verdict for Sherlock gnomes is a  0/10 an epic fail can't believe this movie almost killed paramount  fire whoever your bosses is because you are just not doing well this year.,0,0,Chad Special productions,zC9b1orltc8,0.0381818181818182,2018-12-28 15:30:13,False,False
