Grey is an abuser and a rapist, period. You should be ashamed of yourselves for this. So many women are going to end up being severely injured or even flat out dead because of this. It's bad enough that we have Twilight in which Edward Cullen shows all 15 warning signs of being a wife beater. Then we've got this crap. Pull this movie now, burn it, and go educate yourselves on The Scene properly. I've had friends in The Scene. The first rule is ""Safe, sane, and CONSENSUAL"" which NEVER happens in these so-called books. If Grey was real either he would be banned from all clubs and websites and Ana kidnapped and deprogrammed the way you would someone in a cult, or the second he finds out she's pregnant he'd hit her in the stomach until she miscarries and dies.

So if those people who doesnt like the franchise, you better ignore the stuff and dont comment it, because no comments = no publicity   PAAAPAAAPAAAAAMMMM  So in my opinion, EL James did a good job, because everyone has heard about it and talked about it even it is was for one time.

I just want to say one more thing about the trilogy. I too read the book first, and I thought it was terrible, and based on the book I refused to see the movie. Then EL James came out with a fourth book, it's called Grey, christian point of view. When I started reading that I thought Christian was crude  and a total ass ,but I finished it. I watched the movie after I read those two books. The movie is mild compared to the books. I have read all four books. The next movie Fifty Shades Darker is the best one, and shows them falling deeper in love.
