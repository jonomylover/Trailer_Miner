Using her new youth, the mother then goes out and gets herself a new man in order to have more kids, so that the cycle can start again. You will see this in paintings, photographic evidence, and other found footage that the children will find in the 'grandparents' house... showing that the mother and 'grandparents' have been alive for years and years, and that other children have been sacrificed before them.  The movie will end with the mother dumping all the kids electronics onto the pile with the other evidence of her past lives and children, then waltzing out a younger women. ... the only question is, will the mother and 'grandparents' be enough ""with the times"" to know that content posted over the internet isn't so easily disposed of? Will they finally be caught, or will the children's sacrifice, and the youth it gives them, have altered ALL of their appearances enough that they can claim that they aren't the old couple and mother shown in the videos?

Most horror movies use the super natural as the antagonist and this movie went the complete opposite direction. The use of the elderly as a insane couple is completely realistic and therefore makes the overall movie Better. Also the plot twist of the elderly becoming the antagonist after originally being normal is great. As well for the protagonist having connections to the outside world makes the plot even better. I honestly wished that instead the parents ignoring the problem didn't happen but hopefully that's another plot twist which the way it was shown in the trailer makes it a complete possibility.

Its more funny than scary and the heart felt massage at the end seemed forced after the so called terror climax scene. Save your money and time.

I honestly thought it more of a comedy with a few predictable jump scares in between. Most of which made me laugh or just sit in my seat emotionless but I will admit, the humor is pretty good. As for horror, aside from the jump scares I mentioned before, there isn't that much to see. Although about an hour or so in, things start to get a little more freaky and actually got me a bit suspenseful and exited. I wanted to see what was going to happen next. As for the plot twist, (which I will not spoil here) it was actually really good. I did not see it coming at all (that's probably just me and my friends though).

How come these kids do not know their real grandparents' faces. their mother would have shown them pics of their real grandparents.
