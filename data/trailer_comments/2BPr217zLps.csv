Jennifer Aniston is hilarious! As an older woman, I can fully appreciate her situation. Though I don't have kids, I think it would be really difficult. The scene where the parents ""drop-in"" on their two daughters is probably very realistic. Glad they could finally work things out! Because after all Love is Love üíñüíïüíÉJulia Roberts is great so is this All-Star Cast. Just a fun movie :) The soundtrack is nice too üéµüéπ The main theme has Meghan Trainor?
