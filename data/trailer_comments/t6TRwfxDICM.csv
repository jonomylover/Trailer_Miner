2013-12-14T06:30:39,"Here's an equation for you:  Gladiator + Titanic + Dante's Peak = Pompeii  I think I pretty much nailed it. Kudos to me!  Okay, now on a more serious note. There is a reason why someone would want to make a big budget movie about this theme. If you search the net, and even here on youtube, you will find documentaries about this tragedy.  So first, a bit of history. Vesuvius was a tragedy because it was unprecedented in the Roman Empire. The word 'volcano' comes directly from the god of fire, Vulcan (in Latin, Vulcanus); there was no word for it back then. When the mountain first started to erupt, the fact that people chose to stay in the city is what doomed them. It was through Pliny the Younger, who witnessed the event, that a first, extensively documented account of an active volcano's behavior was registered - and from this, the reason why nowadays volcanologists have a category for volcanoes the likes of Mount Vesuvius named 'Plinian'.  But, returning to magnitude of events, the neighboring cities of Mount Vesuvius were wiped out, no survivors whatsoever. And until then, the Romans hadn't experienced so many losses of civilian life in the very heart of their empire - numbers say 16 thousand -, to forces of nature, no less.  So yes, I can see there's an appeal to making a movie about the theme. Now, is the movie going to be accurate in the events? Well, there's always the dramatization, which is really up to the viewer. On another note, specifically the story, it doesn't mean the protagonists perish, likely as it may sound. One'll have to see it to learn it, after all.  But what I think a movie like this may bring, is a verdict to whether or not Paul W. S. Anderson is able to bring about a decent movie to the table instead of some anachronistic flick - the fact that 'The Three Musketeers' has ships flying through the air with a sort of blimp-like sails in their cover is one of the reasons why I stayed away from that movie -, or he should keep to poorly fleshed-out zombie flicks that have lost any resemblance to the franchise they're supposed to be based on.

Fire and lava didn't kill them - the ones that weren't mortally hit by big pieces of pumice died by asphyxiation. I have always been drawn by Pompeii and Vesuvius.

Unfortunately Hollywood most of the time follows the Queen Victoria line with damsels in love and knight in armor. Love must be everywhere and the motivation for everything. I guess the truth to have an extreme fear mixed with brutal lust when people dying  would not look good on the wide-screen,  only sappy heart breaking stories make money.

There were a lot of issues while watching this film. Things  I disliked: The dialog was supposed to be based in 79 A.D. not present day - with words like hotel resort and bitch. . . Another scene that killed it was when Atticus was running away from the tsunami and all of a sudden stopped to LOOK BACK when he entered the city walls... Last but not least, the volcano erupted for about 40 minutes(real time), and all of these characters are doing everything else but getting to safety - fights, traffic jams, running to different parts of the city, etc...... all in all, I would give this movie a 4 out 10.",1,1,D-Rock,t6TRwfxDICM,0.095,2014-02-24 10:58:06,False,True

Most people hid in their homes to wait out the disaster - as the bodies were all found in buildings. Death came when all that explosive magma, froth, ash and debris - which shot 30km into the air, fell back on itself and formed the avalanches which wiped out Herculaneum and Pompeii. From eye-witness accounts and records of Pliny and others, falling debris was never larger than a cannon ball. Boats had to steer south due to the heavy ash fall. AND only pompeii holds the cast mummies due to the ash fall. Herculaneum holds skeletons.

I have never been much of a Paul W.S Anderson fan so my expectations were quite low, but he really stepped up his game. The drama elements and character building are a bit shallow and the overall story is too generic, but if you can look past that and just focus on the entertainment, this movie is really enjoyable. Being able to relive a fraction of what occurred at Pompeii and seeing Mt Vesuvius explode on the big screen is exceptional. Kit Harrington and Emily Brown also do a good job carrying the movie, even with cheesy dialogue. I also liked the casting for the supporting actors,  Kiefer Sutherland, Jared Harris and Carrie Ann-Moss are all actors whom I admire and although they only play minor characters and don't get enough chances to shine, their presence really levitates the movie... Overall I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the subject and isn't too concerned with substance. ",2,0,kickyim,t6TRwfxDICM,0.09866666666666667,2014-02-28 17:55:11,False,True

It's based on a real tragedy that took many lives and at the same time it's combined with a love story. And honestly movies like this are meant to be dramatized because they show what people affected by these disasters felt they were seeing. I mean to us it's a natural disaster but to them it was the end of there world. They never witnessed anything like it before. So the reason this movie is dramatized and over exaggerated a little is because the movie director does not want to show what people think is true but to show what people in pompeii felt they were seeing through there own eyes. ,0,0,Jordan Halabi,t6TRwfxDICM,0.21923076923076928,2014-05-20 02:41:01,False,True

In fact, scholars say that the mountain is hundreds of thousands of years old and had been erupting for generations. In about 1780 B.C., for example, an unusually violent eruption (known today as the “Avellino eruption”) shot millions of tons of superheated lava, ash and rocks about 22 miles into the sky. That prehistoric catastrophe destroyed almost every village, house and farm within 15 miles of the mountain.But it was easy to overlook the mountain’s bad temper in such a pleasant, sunny spot. Even after a massive earthquake struck the Campania region in 63 A.D.–a quake that, scientists now understand, offered a warning rumble of the disaster to come–people still flocked to the shores of the Bay of Naples.

She wasn’t fully dead and since she’s for fire , the lava didn’t melt her. It revived her. She then became one with mount Vesuvius .    After Jon left the nights watch with the wildlings, he was captured and taken as a slave to Pompeii . He had already gotten over Danaerys a long time ago bc he thought she was crazy and he didn’t like that their relationship was incestuos which explains why in the trailer he has another love interest  So since Danaerys is one with the volcano, she’s one with the earth and she felt her murderous lovers presence near her so she slowly started building up strength/energy until she erupted.
