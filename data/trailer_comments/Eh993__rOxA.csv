Louisa Clark is no longer just an ordinary girl living an ordinary life. After the transformative six months spent with Will Traynor, she is struggling without him. When an extraordinary accident forces Lou to return home to her family, she can‚Äôt help but feel she‚Äôs right back where she started.  Her body heals, but Lou herself knows that she needs to be kick-started back to life. Which is how she ends up in a church basement with the members of the Moving On support group, who share insights, laughter, frustrations, and terrible cookies. They will also lead her to the strong, capable Sam Fielding‚Äîthe paramedic, whose business is life and death, and the one man who might be able to understand her. Then a figure from Will‚Äôs past appears and hijacks all her plans, propelling her into a very different future. . . .  For Lou Clark, life after Will Traynor means learning to fall in love again, with all the risks that brings. But here Jojo Moyes gives us two families, as real as our own, whose joys and sorrows will touch you deeply, and where both changes and surprises await.  After You is quintessential Jojo Moyes‚Äîa novel that will make you laugh, cry, and rejoice at being back in the world she creates. Here she does what few novelists can do‚Äîrevisits beloved characters and takes them to places neither they nor we ever expected.",0,0,REVOgAmeR,Eh993__rOxA,0.15009157509157509,2016-02-08 12:13:55,True,True

2016-04-24T05:06:18,"Read the book, regardless of how good this movie may be I could not possibly support something like this.  Spoilers!!    He dies in the end and his decision was selfish and very shortsighted. The writer wrote this after reading about a former soccer player doing the same thing and just took it from there and I personally don't think who ever that person was, the soccer player, was right either. Life is difficult and the longer we live the higher the likelihood that we'll be injured in some accident, and of course there's death. His entire argument was about how ""this wasn't the life he chose"", NEWS FLASH: NOBODY GETS TO CHOOSE. There are literally thousands of REAL people living with debilitating conditions that have left them paralyzed and wheelchair bound and they've found some joy in life. I don't know what I would do if I were to suddenly become paralyzed and thought that life was so terrible that I needed to end it but I feel like with a subject like this the writer was just flat out wrong and spreading a message like this is terrible. With the knowledge that we are indeed killing our planet, plenty of people are saying death is better than watching the world burn and that is just making things worse. I feel like Will telling Lou that everything she did made him happy and then turning around and still going through with it was such a letdown. I feel like people should always try to find the good in life no matter how short-lived and no matter how bad it gets because life is a precious thing. I just pray that the truly awful ways that humanity is trying to give up on life, The Euthanasia Roller Coaster in particular, don't come  to fruition.  (The roller coaster is awful, don't look this up if you value your sanity, i'm not even trying to use reverse psychology, this is a real thing and it made me physically sick//Just know it is a thing that a man, who's really just an intelligent serial killer, is trying to have made// I have no idea how real it is...

In the end, Will is a brave hero for setting his lover free to explore the world, unencumbered by the burden of having to care for him.¬† :(¬† they weren't afraid to show some of the scary mental realities of living with such a disability, like the feelings of being a burden to others or the helplessness of being unable to perform basic needs.  Unfortunately, they took those realities and blew them up to a ridiculous degree so that the message became: being in a wheelchair is so awful that you'd be better off Dead. This film erases all that complexity and nuance. The Masses will never be able to distinguish between Will's story and the Universal Truth about living with a disability, which is a problem, because it will influence how they think about disability in the future.I believe that life is beautiful, with or without my disease, and I can introduce you to thousands of my wheelchair brethren who feel the same way‚Äîsuccessful, awesome, happy people who are insulted by the notion that their wheelchairs make life not worth living.This film is not an accurate depiction of typical life with a disability, or even life in general, and I hope that you (don't) enjoy it accordingly.

Most of the people who have seen the movie don't even know why the title seems selfish and should have been the other way around. It's me before you because the protagonist had chosen to free the female character of all the possible burden of being with him and giving the ultimate sacrifice of setting her free and in that process allowing her to see the world and grow and explore her full potential free of any possible sacrifices that he knew she'd face with him being there; it's his way of saying that if he were to stay, he'd only be in her way. Yes, life is full of challenges, and yes, the protagonist has all the money in the world to see the best doctors so he could possibly improve his condition, but in reality, his dignity and true happiness is something only he can define. Personally, if assisted suicide is something that could be readily available to me, I'll take advantage of that great opportunity. I've lived all my life living for other people. If anything, I am only truly living my life for them and not myself anymore. Have I tried changing my point of view, and try to reach out to others to make myself happier and have a different perspective in life? Absolutely! I just never felt like I belong; I've always felt like I'm an alien surrounded by people who'll never understand how it feels to be me. Is it truly worth living when all that's left in me is misery and despair? Often, people are full of guilt, and that's all they're thinking about. The truth is how many of us even truly care about someone for us to fully say that you've given 100% to make sure you've made a difference in someone else's life. What's selfish is guilt...allowing someone to live when you know that deep inside of him/her there's nothing left but the misery of continuing a life full of void and nothingness! If there's any message that this movie wants to leave us with, it's the fact that true love isn't selfish. True love knows how to set someone free because it's what's best for them. In the end, the protagonist has left the female character the message that love isn't defined by longevity but the sacrifice we're willing to give too see the other person grow and live a life full of potential. I hope that people start having an open mind when it comes to accepting how others want to define their lives. The protagonist clearly sees his physical end as a new beginning for those he love, and I just hope that we become more open-minded in how we respect and understand how others want to put an end in their physical existence. The ultimate sacrifice and true measure of love, in my opinion, is how well we keep love alive when memory is all that's left for us. Yes, happiness is a choice, but life is too; happiness isn't the only thing that's needed for us to live. I just hope that the next time you call a suicidal person selfish, you at least consider asking yourself if you've done anything at all to change that person's perspective in life or see what it's like to live in their shoes. It's easy to judge a person and his/her decisions in life because often, people tend to always leave empathy some place else other than their hearts.",1,0,nathanblue,Eh993__rOxA,0.19234168609168606,2016-06-04 01:12:57,False,True

The trailer--that was it.That was almost the entire movie. 2.- haven't read the book, but I already had a feeling it would have a sad ending, BUT something in me was hoping the movie would take a different course and surprise the viewers. (I waited for it!Even when the credits started showing up, I still hoped and waited for it. Maybe, maybe...the movie is not yet done :( ) - While I could see the beauty of the story and feel Will's suffering, I couldn't help but think that it could have been a much better one if the ending was portrayed differently. I mean, we go to cinemas and watch movies  hoping we'd be entertained and would feel good after (NOT to be heartbroken and feeling sad.)   I love everything in the movie except the ending.

2016-06-20T01:13:50,"Me Before You is one of the best British films I have seen in a long time. With a setting near Wales' 11th century Pembroke Castle, the theme of working-class gal and handsome wheelchair-bound hyper-intelligent hunk, stretches incredulity a bit, but it's wholly enjoyable and engaging throughout. A bit like 50 Shades of Grey without the spankings, a bit like Four Weddings and a Funeral with only one wedding! Sam Claflin, who plays Will Traynor, is watchable throughout: Jamie Dornan should feel afraid, because Sam matches Jamie in the pretty boy stakes! The girls in the cinema audience were all anticipating the couple's first kiss and had full empathy for the rich paralysed hunk throughout the proceedings. The class aspects jar a bit: the girl's family is in need of more paid work and she's happy to land the position as Will's carer, although utterly inexperienced. As a working-class family they see things completely in terms of dragging in a buck- or should I say a quid? For instance, at the end she tells Mrs Traynor, ""you don't have to pay me"", which absurdly depicts the tie in terms of remuneration only, ignoring the emotional connection that the couple has already established! In other words, would she really still be that money-centred? Her family is a bit too clean to be real battlers, besides. Ok, many of the themes are far from new and are not unique, this is a rom-com of the genre type, but I thoroughly enjoyed everything about it, I was involved in the events, but I would have liked to have been right with him to the end. You'll know what I mean, once you view the movie. Do yourself a favor, go see Me Before You! Even blokes will enjoy it!",1,0,weskitten,Eh993__rOxA,0.20208913110698826,2016-06-20 01:13:50,False,True

Well, I went to see this movie with my friends this afternoon and it doesn't come up with my expectation. I know the ending, I know the plot before watching it. The main actress and actor are good, but still, I doesn't give me positive feeling. The problem is not about the movie or the actress or actor, but about the plot, the story. It's not a good ending, it doesn't motivate people even though the final message is to 'live bold', to 'live well' while in fact, the main character is a coward.  People may say he knows sooner or later he will die (well, we all do), and he doesn't want to live and be paralysed like that. But see, Stephen Hawking, see Hellen Keller and many many more disable people who are in so much horrible situations and they still LIVE WELL to their best. And how about this guy? He's rich, his family is rich, he has all modern equipment to support his disability, he's handsome and has a charming smile, and well, he feels useless, he feels no life and he wants to die. Many people just want to live, fight to live, struggle to live so that they can spend the time with their family, see their children to grow up and so on.   I regret watching this movie. It's not motivating or inspiring whatsoever though it tries to convey the message of 'live well' or 'live bold'. If it is to motivate or inspire, the main main actor should change his mind, not to choose the death, but to live in a meaningful way with the main actress, they can help other disadvantage people, or they can try other ways of treatment.

We don't really like to contemplate on the consequences of the choices we make. Whether they were right or wrong or how they would  impact others. Will's choice was devastating, but we made choices everyday that could end in devastating results too. That's why this movie impacts me so much, it is so scary knowing that I can choose to end my life and there is a facility that will help and can make it legally okay. Whether Will's choice to end his life was a right or a wrong decision, I don't wanna go there. There are religions that talk about it, but I think the movie nor the book mention religion that much. Devastating ending. Although it is brilliantly played by the actor and a very good romance movie, I.AM.TRAUMATISED, Lol. I had no idea of the ending, no idea what dignities was, and was watching the movie for the romance, so I was not prepared. After this I am just going to get back on how handsome Sam Claflin is.

Just saw it tonight and fell hopelessly in love with SAM CLAFLIN!!!! He is SOOOOO incredibly good looking!!! And despite a few of the negative comments posted here, Emilia is absolutely adorable in the movie (quirkie yes, but still adorable)!!! Unfortunately, the author of the novel chose to end the story with Mr Traynor (Sam) making a morally unacceptable and all-around wrong and extremely selfish choice for his life - thus, what could have been a totally five-star movie was ruined for some of us. Would loved to have seen an ending with a beautiful wedding and a wonderful ""happily ever after"" for the couple.

2016-09-28T03:16:33,"I loved every scene of the main couple; it felt so genuine and so real. Which is why the ending tore me apart more than I thought...  *spoilers*   It doesn't venture too much into Will's mind, but just with what we got really made me see his pain and perspective on why he chose the decision he did.  I wish he hadn't, I do, because their relationship should've been one much longer than it was. But, it really shows how to seize each moment, each event, each precious memory with someone while you have it. The truth is that your life can turn upside down as quickly as it did for Will, and ultimately, you have the choice to do what you want in this limited time we're on earth.   It just makes it more interesting because it's controversial, the topic of euthanasia.  Like as presented with Lou's mom near the end of the movie. But as much as I have my qualms about willingly dying, I do believe each person should be given the choice the decide on their own life; to live less but end it peacefully, rather than continuing a very limited and constant pain and struggle everyday.  What matters, what's worth to go on, that's on each individual's case. But, as Lou's father said (also) near the end, and what I think ultimately this movie teaches, is to love; to love and to live. If not in your own life because of circumstances (like Will), to motivate the one you love to live theirs to the fullest.  The desire to watched your loved one be happy, I think it's indescribable.  Overall I would've liked to see more of Will before the accident and just his thoughts in general.  I cried so much, so that just says how I attached I could get to him in just around an hour and 40 mins, but i'm left with wanting just a bit more.  Still, this was so incredibly beautiful.

There IS life after an injury and its up to YOU to live the life you want. I've watched hundreds of paras and quads vlogs on youtube and it showed me that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. You just need to adapt and relearn things, it is not easy or for the weak. You need to be STRONG and this movie could have ended on a positive note but decided to go the ignorant path. I relearned how to do EVERYTHING from sitting up to eating to bathing, and at first i wanted my life to end but through support and love only then have i found life to be truly special. Its is a struggle and not easy but this movie just let the main character wither away in negativity and I am amazed that it has soo many likes.

But life is extremely hard for quads. Especially for someone like Will, whose life has been limitless. He could do anything he wanted. He could jump off cliffs, go skiing and do some really dangerous stuff. Imagine you were someone like that, and then suddenly everything changes and you become unable to do anything. Imagine having the whole wide world in your hand one day and the next you loose it. Wouldn't everything feel empty and dull? Wouldn't you feel a hole in your heart. To see the person you were, to dream of him, and then wake up to live another miserable day. Will has lived the past two years as a helpless man whose choices were made for him. Doing what he did in the ending meant that he finally made his own choice. Louisa made his last six months the most wonderful time he's had. But being there only made his desire to commit suicide stronger. He wanted her to spread her wings and just LIVE.  So.... If you think hard about it. It's kind of a happy ending. I know it might seem absurd to say that. But Will got to make his own choice and Louisa gets a chance at a fresh start. I love the movie and I wouldn't have wanted to end otherwise.

The movie was BEAUTIFUL, I mean the sceneries, the music, AND the acting really got to me but I gotta say this: The book was much much better. Sadly, so many things are missing in the movie: Will's sister Georgina, Lou applying for college, Lou moving in with Patrick, The break up scene, Lou & Will's night at the hotel after the wedding and much more but I got really mad when they cut the content of Will's letter at the end..
