In first 2 minutes, we can see 2 jumps from car to train that it seems is going at least 15 miles (lol). And in stand those people after jump will reach 30 meters at least behind the car, they reach train. Beyond any physic. And ok i can understand. How can it be a action movie with heroes without capacities? It can't be action movie. It have 6.8 rating in IMDb. If it was more realistic how much did it rating? With 18/10? The problematic is the rating of a serious critic site. ¬†I feel sad also with young guys who eat them without judge. I repeat. Its not only for these movie. Its about most of them. Thats why i prefer marvel. It have super heroes and they are super heroes. They are allowed to do everything. But what can we do?

With these money you can make miracles. And action miracles. I am not sure. You haven't got the imagination? ¬†You have it but you don't want to provide her or the crowd does't want to buy? Of course you have the crowd that you train. And probably that is very convenient. And it does't regards only movies, but everything. And now i'll enjoy the movie. Action and comedy.

I want you to know that I'm not scared. Well, not of dying anyways. It's more forgetting. It's losing myself to this virus, that's what scares me. So everynight I've been saying their names outloud: A;by, Winston, Chuck. And I just repeat them over and over, like a prayer. And it all comes flooding back. Just a little things like when the sun used to hit the glade at that perfect moment right before it slipped beneath the walls. And I remember Fry Pan's Stew. I never thought I'd missed that stuff so much.  And I remember you. I remember the first time you came up to the box, just a scared little Greenie who coudn't even remember his own name. But from that moment you ran into the maze, I knew I would follow you anywhere. And I have. We all have. My hope for you, is when you're looking back years from now, you'll be able to say the same. The future's in your hands now, Tommy. And I know you'll find a way to do what's right. You always have. Take care of everyone for me. And take care of yourself. You deserve to be happy.

But the plot ruined it completely for me. All the characters seemed to be taking decisions only based on their emotions without any serious logical thinking. IDK if this was the director's idea to potray heroism.  Also, a lot of times in the film, the protagonist and his friends got stuck in a really bad situation but a miracle happened every single time. After a point, I felt so disconnected and stopped worrying about the characters at all as I knew that some miracle would happen and they would be saved.  Anyways, that is just my opinion.

I hated myself for listening to those idiots. I've read the whole series myself including the prequels and I think the movie series is actually better. The music is just like an arrow that pierces through any mind and give you the sense of the feelings the characters are experiencing. The actors are amazing. They perfectly executed the characters in the book. The movie beat is just awesome. It's just perfectly synchronized compared in the books. Hats off to the directors. This is the best movie in the series. For those who have been told that the movie is bad, just don't listen to those people. I've learned something from watching book adaption movies. It's always not gonna be the same so don't expect the same thing or it's just going to disappoint you. Instead, clear your mind of any speculations you have of the movie and just think like you're reading a new book with a new and better story in it.
