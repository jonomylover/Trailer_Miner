2015-04-30T21:47:48,"James Bond is the biggest film role for a British actor so everyone is the age group wants to play him. There is a lot of talk about how Henry was wanted for the role and was too young, and how he will be old and mature enough to play him in the next one. Roger Moore was famous as The pop Saint before he took the role. There is a famous episode of that show where Simon Templar gets mistaken for James Bond. It is all highly speculative. Lazenby was cast to replace Connery not Moore then Connery played him one more time so Moore didn't take the role til the 8th film. The same goes for Brosnan becoming Bond after Remington Steele. Dalton got cast, did two films, then there was a gap of several years before Goldeneye. Could Brosnan really have done Living Daylights. As for the whole Bond being black thing, that is the usual post PC reverse racism issue again. It was done with Dr Who. Let's make him black, let's make him a woman, like we did with the Star Trek captains. If there had been a fifth Star Trek series then no doubt the captain would never been a black woman. Why do we never consider a Chinese or Indian actor when this comes up, why is it always African ex slave descent?
