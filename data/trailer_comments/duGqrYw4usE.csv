2017-04-30T20:25:45,"Facts and realities the tobacco industry must accept own documents, are set out below. The industry should now be required to admit these: 1. That smoking causes many kinds of cancer, heart disease and respiratory illnesses which are fatal for many sufferers. The industry still does not publicly accept that smoking causes lung cancer. 2. That annual global death toll caused by smoking is 4 million. By 2030, that figure will rise to 10 million with seventy percent of those deaths occurring in developing countries. 3. That nicotine is the most important active ingredient in tobacco; that the tobacco companies are in the drug business; the drug is nicotine and that the cigarette is a drug delivery device. The industry maintains it is a simple consumer goods industry. 4. That nicotine is physiologically and psychologically addictive, in a similar way to heroin and cocaine - rather than shopping, chocolate or the Internet. The overwhelming majority of smokers are strongly dependent on nicotine and that this is a substantial block to smokers‚Äô quitting if they choose to. The industry still maintains that nicotine is not addictive in the sense used here. 5. That teenagers (13-18) and children (<13) are inherently important to the tobacco market and that companies are competing for market share in these age groups. The industry maintains that its business is only focussed on adults. 6. That advertising increases total consumption as well as promoting brand share. The industry flatly denies this. 7. That advertising is one (of several) important and interlocking ingredients that nurture smoking behaviour among teenagers and children. The industry denies its advertising influences the smoking behaviour of children. 8. That current formulations of low tar cigarettes create false health reassurance and offer little or no health benefit. The industry has either not publicly accepted this or argued that it never claimed any health benefits. 9. That second-hand smoke is a real public health hazard, including causing childhood diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, cot-death and glue ear, and is a cause of lung cancer and heart disease in adults. The industry has mounted a major disinformation campaign in this area. That the tobacco industry has the normal duty of any manufacturer to ensure that it does not market a defective product and that its products are as safe as possible.",0,0,Highly Unlikely,duGqrYw4usE,0.13548387096774195,2017-04-30 20:25:45,False,True

A Good film and enjoyed it only complaints was that it could have done with less exposition and unnecessary visual references to the 1st film (probably WETA influenced) such a tactic to references did not work in  the Hobbit and they do not work here either would have been better if they just got on with the story.

I just think there were too many characters in this film to keep track of¬†and the plot/storyline was presented in a¬†much more complex fashion than it needed to be.¬†In fact, the storyline seemed so convoluted that there was more than one occasion while I was watching the film¬†where I asked myself, ""What is going on in this movie? Why am I even sitting here watching this?"" I also wasn't impressed with the film's heavy usage of CGI. I guess the only way you're going to truly enjoy this film is if you're a die-hard Marvel comics fan who already¬†has a great deal of comic book knowledge going into this film¬†and/or you're huge¬†fan of¬†the sci-fi/fantasy genre. Neither of these things apply to me, which I think is the reason I didn't like this movie all that much.

2017-05-06T20:43:32,"Just saw the film and may I say I LOVED IT! Iam incredibly honored and happy to say that I really loved this film, and that it is another Marvel hit. Let me start off by saying that the film was extremely fun and unique. The colors, visuals, and scenery was beaut IFUL and pleasing to lay your eyes on. The planets, space, lifeforms, everything was really well done, and you can tell they paid a lot od attention to detail. The action was superb and had an exciting atmosphere that created a very fun and crazy tone. The style of action and fighting really brought another mostly fresh take and door opening to the MCU. A lot of exolosions, guns, missles, blasters, space fights, spaceships, jeckpacks and more was included in the film, and man was it awesome! But to me where the film really shines is in the characters. I did not expect the film to be so emotional and depressing, and how hard hitting certain moments and scenes were. A lot of times, and one big moment in the film where a character reveals something about another characters mother, the WHOLE AUDITORIUM GASPS and you felt the emotion in the air. People were crying and sobbing, and you hear and see everyone in a upset state of mind. Yes the movie was extremely fun but where it lies is how well most of the characters were developed. GREAT JOB TO THE MAIN CAST! CHRIS PRATT AS STARTLORD, BRADLEY COOPER AS ROCKET, ZOE SALDANA AS GAMORA, DAVE BAUTISTA AS DRAX, VIN DIESEL AS GROOT, KURT RUSSELL AS EGO, MICHAEL FRICKIN ROOKER AS YONDU AND MANTIS (I cannot remember the actresses name).YOU ALL DID GREAT! Every character within the film fleshes out, and has their own time to shine and show their developement. Throughout the film, you bond with the Guardians and really see their emotional and human side, which leaves the audience in tears and saddness. Starlord was incredible and really added a human element to the film, and shows why people love him so much. You cannot hate him because he is too good, and you really see him develope even more.Drax provided great humor to the movie, but also grew as a character as well. Gamora was great and she began to develope and show a soft side, and her emotional side really shows. Baby Groot was adorable, and this made him seem so innocent and pure which gave the film more emotion. Mantis was good although she came in a little late. Kurt Russell, who was good, but I CANNOT speak to much on him because of spoilers. But to me, the two that really stood out and got the most development were Yondu and Rocket. I cannot explain how much emotion and humanity that have the film. Every scene that were in that had your eyes watery and has you depressed because you really got to see the side of themselves you would never have thought you would see. I LOVED THEM IN THE FILM! THE whole audience would gasps, cry, and aww the two, especially Rocket, because they had you gripped and thinking about them constantly. And oh man they have some of the best, and saddest scenes in the movie and imo comic book movie history. Besides the positives the film does have things holding it back. Nebula to me was overused and over exaggerated.Even though she has a dark past, she felt a little bit to angry at times and her acting seemed forced. The first and third act were incredible, but the middle was a little choppy with its storytelling and plot, even though the STORY itself is great. But all in all, I FRICKIN LOVED GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOLUME 2! I recommend everyone to go check this movie out, if you weren't going to already for some rwasonüòï. If your a comic book fan or movie fan, this movie will blow your hearts away and satisfy you. A great film that anyone can love. Great Job to the cast of Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 for the great amrketing, promoting, interviews, merchandise, hype, and overall great movie.

Seriously do they realize that Mantis could probably kick all their asses without even trying lol.   Mantis has never lost in hand-to-hand combat ever!! Maybe with the exception to her supervillain father Libra. She has the ability of astral projection as well. She can separate her physical and Astro forms.   Projecting herself anywhere in universe there's plant life. Pretty useful ability if you're trying to find a planet that's inhabitable. She can control vegetation nearby and can heal herself as well.   That's in addition to her telepathic and precognitive abilities. I would say she's a pretty bad ass character.

It in no way had the charm, action, excitement, or charisma the first film had at all. And the only character who ""grew"" was rocket. They also had 4 side plots that went nowhere or went unexplained. Suddenly BatmanVSuperman doesn't seem so bad, nor Marvel's own Iron Man 3 or Age Of Ultron.  We also know why unlike every other movie trailer they didn't spoil anything. There was nothing good to spoil. Also right after Dr. Strange another giant head evil dude whose trying to dominate the planet, and then with Ivan Ooze goo/parallax diarrhea??

2017-05-17T06:28:07,"My quick review: This is nowhere near as good a movie as Guard of Galaxy 1. Some of the visuals are even better than part 1. The first half of the movie dragged on. The main problem was the dialogue was a lot of bathroom humor and goofy bad jokes (and I know this franchise is supposed to have some goofy humor, but it was wayyy overdone) Some of the jokes, and I could care less about censorship or adult humor, were downright disgusting, as in gross. The second half had some excellent action scenes but the action scenes in part 1 seemed better choreographed or something. I would rate it a C+ or B- and part 1 I would give an A. Plot and characters were all over the place. Even for a purposefully light funny and goofy action movie, the jokes mostly fell flat. Worth seeing but nowhere near as cohesive as part 1. Dialogue in action sci fi and comic book movies seems to be getting more and more off-the-wall and silly every year. Every scene does not have to be a snappy dumb one-liner.
