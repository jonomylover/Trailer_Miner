2020-02-22T00:09:59,"Okay so i have a theory about this movie. It is a little far fetched but stay with me! (SPOILER ALERT)   So Michael (Nesson) as we see in the beginning of the movie, has a fairly ordinary life. He isn't rich, he isn't poor, he is an ordinary American doing his job, that he has had for the last 10 years. He takes the train to his workplace, and upon leaving the train, one of his old fellow commutes talks about how everything feels like a countdown. One day it is all over. Nesson's character responds ""what is?"" And the guy says ""life""    That same rainy gloomy day, Michael (Nesson) gets called into his boss's office, and without sugar coating it, he gets fired.   The boss mentions he is a hard working individuel and the sound begins to fade, and we see a closeup of Michaels face, and the background is blurry, indicating he is about to get dizzy. We hear something along the lines ""you are a good soldier, but in reality sometimes soldiers end up as casualties""   now.   All of this happened in the movie. And the movies takes off with him going to the bar, and then the train ride etc etc..  Here is where my theory comes into play.    Michael, after being laid off, gets a heart attack in his boss's office, and dies.   After leaving the office building disoriented we see Michael heading out into the sunlight, with a group of people walking towards him, but isn't paying attention to him - almost as if he isn't there.   The next shot, we hear his phone ringing, and the ringtone is the default Alarm Clock sound from the Apple iPhone. Indicating - The time is up.   The following events in the movie is his walk into ""the afterlife"" Will he go to heaven or hell? Or will he survive the ""heart attack"" and get ""revived""?     There a numerous references throughout the movie, that could indicate that all of this is the hidden plot of the movie.   So who is Joanna? (Vera Farmiga) The beautiful charming girl on the train? She is Death. The Grim Reaper. Charon. Call her what you want. She basically tests Nesson's character throughout the movie. He has to prove that he is ""a good man""   Nesson's character isn't aware that he is dead. All he know, is that the whole situationen feels ""off"".   Further ""hints"" are dropped throughout the movie indicating that Michael is dead, or is at very least is on the verge of dying .    Everything seems brightly lit, and the color of the sky has a certain ""Vanilla Sky"" feel to it (Vanilla Sky 2001 - Tom Cruise) Again. Something is ""off"".   Michael gets a call from Joanna (Vera Farmiga) and as the situation escalates he demands that he gets to speak to his family. His wife and son. He then gets to ""hear them"" it sound like a normal conversation between the two. She has lost her ring, and the son asks ""have you asked dad?"" in which she replies ""he never answers his phone"" etc etc.. We then hear a gentleman approach his wife and child ""Are you Karen MacCauley?"" he asks. And then we hear ""it's about your husband.."" and then the call gets cut off.   So this is basically him hearing his family getting the news about his death.   At one point one of the passengers refers to the conditions of the train as ""the seventh circle of hell"" which refers to Dantes Inferno (Italian writer Dante Alighieri's poem about his travel through hell.)   But? Who is Alex Murphy's (Patrick Wilson) character? The bad guy? He is the devil. or at least the symbolism of the devil. He tries to trick Michael several times throughout the movie, so that Michael eventually would end up in hell.   Captain Hawthorne? (Sam Neill) what about him? He is god. (symbolism) He saves Michael in the end, and he knows everything that is going on, with Alex Murphy (the bad guy) and what not.    Is Michael ""Saint Michael"" The leader of gods armies? (honestly, i don't know enough about the bible and the history of it, but i couldn't help but make that reference)     He gets his ""shield"" back in the end, he reenlist in the Police Department. Captain Hawthorne says something along the lines ""we miss guys like you in the department, guys that do it right"" God needs his Saint Michael..   There are a bunch of more references and hints in the movie, and i can't remember all of them. I have to watch the movie again..   So.. Have i over analyzed a mediocre Liam Nesson movie? Or was this the original idea for the movie, that then got canned when they were shooting it? or is there a third possibility?",0,0,Wiss Kid,aDshY43Ol2U,0.06147163120567376,2020-02-22 00:09:59,False,False
