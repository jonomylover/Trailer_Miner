She already has the last hunger games and new x men series movies, i feel like she needs to take a couple of years off then come back with a power packed performance. As for Bradley Cooper he needs to slow down as well it seems like he is trying to win an oscar every year until he finally gets it; he seriously needs some time off and return with a powerful performance he doesn't need to be nominated every year calm down.

2015-07-16T16:43:17,"Hugely prolific cast that is transcended by Jennifer Lawrence, who is the real star appeal. Well and truly cements itself enough as a big ""Oscar-stealing portrayal of just how demented normality is"" arthouse film to be reckoned by the Academy Awards as more than a possibility. Just as seemingly over-long, condescendingly high-brow, over-acted and over-celebrated as the glittering ""all smoke, no fire"" Oscars themselves with such money thrown at it to make third world citizens feel more famished than they already are. As further proof that the Academy Awards celebrate film industry success stories instead of art, David O. Russell will continue to selfishly hog the short-list nominations because of stringing his puppeteer cast of chemistry, fame, brilliance and Jennifer Lawrence together to bring home more golden statues that are too good to be charitable. The above comment on all things award-winning, prestigious and seasoned honoured by the Academy Awards of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences committee whose overwhelming white male majority will recognise quality over big names and publicity is as slim as their bellies, had been an assertion for Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle come award season. Silver Linings Playbook was a nice wee romantic drama with an edge of the characters being socially and emotionally dysfunctional but would have been nothing to Oscar voters and the general public without the strength of Mr O. Russell's name or the performances of his already popular stars Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver who all propelled the film to become receptor to Oscars; and American Hustle had an incredible cast, hogged the award nominations, made big bucks and felt bigger and better than the film that bagged Lawrence her Oscar, although the overrated Hustle was quietly unpopular with its non-critic audience including me.
