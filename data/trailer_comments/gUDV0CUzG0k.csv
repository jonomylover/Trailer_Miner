Personally, my interest is piqued because this has a lot of actors I like; Ellen Page (she alone would be enough of a selling point, honestly), Kiersey Clemons and Diego Luna (imdb also lists Kiefer Sutherland, which might make for an interesting tie-in with the original). The score sounds pretty original and creepily atmospheric, and the CG doesn't look half bad.

Only ONE actor from the original ‚ÄúFlatliners‚Äù movie makes a return here and yet, the film isn‚Äôt considered a sequel......which I don‚Äôt have a problem with. The problems that I DO have with this movie is WAY too many to count. How about trying to explain just how utterly incompetent and useless most of the central characters in this movie are (Ellen Page being the ONLY exception), especially when they freakin‚Äô John Travolta from ‚ÄúPhenomenon‚Äù themselves? Not only is it unneeded, but there‚Äôs no attempt at fleshing out what or WHO they really are, giving you very little reason to like, care or even connect with these characters. Even before we get UP to THAT point, the entire arc behind this movie makes very little sense, since this movie is LACKING something that it actually REQUIRES to ACTUALLY be somewhat decent. It gets relatively confusing by the third act of the film, it fails TREMENDOUSLY at being a horror film, the dialogue is terrible and PLEASE don‚Äôt get me started on the screenplay. The film is almost completely self-aware of how bad it is and it‚Äôs filled with so many unintentional moments that it almost comes out being unintentional funny......  .....except it‚Äôs NOT.   Almost EVERYTHING about this flick is awful because a premise like this HAD been done well before in the past. It had the potential to work once again and yet it still didn‚Äôt work out the way it was supposed to.

Normally everyone thinks and agrees that when you die that is it. Nothing else.

Which religion, if any of them, at all, had their bases covered?"".  You see, the upside to this movie is that this concept has been done for stories repeatedly. What happens when you die, and if there is an afterlife, and whether the answers would weigh over your heads and dictate how you live your life.

2020-05-07T17:58:44,"<spoilers> movie is okay  i liked the bit where she's dead for the first time and it's going great but right at the end you see her fear/rage thing light up, and later handsome-guy also has him entering this scarier world. I thought at that point that the scariness would come from the fact that there's something really bad waiting for everyone in the 'after-life', but then they went away from that and just had the characters having mental breakdowns instead, which was disappointing   i like that for most of the character's there's a happy ending",0,0,Gar Tahk,gUDV0CUzG0k,0.19505494505494506,2020-05-07 17:58:44,False,False
