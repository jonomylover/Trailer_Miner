Some have not been up to par, but for the most part they've all been wonderful. I did find this trailer a bit underwhelming. I've heard much buzz surrounding Crimson Peak and was interested to see the trailer, but I wasn't feeling it. I do think much of it has to do with Mia Wasikowska. I've never been a fan of her's and I tend to lean toward the feeling that she drags down any film that she's in. She usually plays the same character and she doesn't add much life to any scene she's in, and while I hate to base my opinion of her character off a 2 1/2 minute trailer, it does seem like her typical thing. I really wanted to like this trailer. I just didn't. I perked up when I saw Tom Hiddleston but I just couldn't get passed my complete indifference to Wasikowska. I'd rather love her or hate her, but I just don't even care about her which is bad to me. She's like the female Brecken Meyer. They could both disappear and I just wouldn't care.

And, Edith tells her brother that he cannot leave her with tears in her eyes and he seemed agitated.  I think Edith is a serial killer from a line of them and her brother brings her victims. Perfect setting in a old house that has privacy to do ""whatever"" without anyone questioning them. So, the people she has murdered are now ghosts. It also appears that the older gentlemen at the dance is a victim. His son is probably in love with the wife and will at some point save her. Although the ghosts appear malevolent, some will attempt to tell her and save her. I also think the complication/romance is going to be the brother is going to fall in love with his wife.

2015-10-22T23:32:09,"Del Toro, I didn't want to, but I wound up loving most of your work. Now you've lost me. This trailer is mismarketed and so is this film. It is NOT a 'gothic romance' and it is NOT a 'horror' or a 'thriller'. It just dances back and forth between elements of the three as if you had written all three complete stories in mind and just wound up making aesthetics, NOT the house itself, a key player. You don't even introduce us to the grounds in an ominous enough way or pull out great performances, either. You talked about this being an empowering film for women and it is the opposite of that. There are no clear villains or victims and while that worked in a film like The Devil's Backbone and The Golden Army, it does not work here. We want Hiddleston to be an all-out monster or a hero, not rape-bully and the same is true for the rest of this powerful cast; you got Alice, Loki, and a Jaeger Pilot and used them to form the flimsiest love triangle since The . . . so that was YOU that did that in The Hobbit! The metaphor between butterflies and moths is not nearly as dark as you think, either. It actually seems silly in this setting. While I think this has a place in film like 'Sleepy Hollow' was a Tim Burton film strictly this could be seen as strictly a Del Toro style of film; but are bloodlust for land from our protagonists (that's right, industrialists were just that, not heroic and selfless in the majority of their cases Carnegie was a once in a lifetime guy) and constant undertones of incest that have been building in your films really what you want the world to associate with you? I would've written the ending to show at least a photograph of Edith's mother courting Thomas to hint at either immortality through keeping the house and the two are desperate for that reason as well as isolated, or to find out that Edith's mother is cousin to the Sharpe family and that gives her a bloodlink that allows her to remove that dishonor from the family name. And why wasn't the ghost of her father looking out for her as well? Do you not believe in male ghosts for their own sake, just women's? If Edith could just 'see ghosts' and was not simply intuitive the way an unexplained Stephen King child gets telepathy, then why was she not 'seeing dead people' much, much more unless she could pinpoint her father telling her to ignore them or something? You had an interesting idea, but like so many people in art galleries you only got in a few pieces and didn't take in the depth of the whole exhibit. I think what Stephen King really found scary about your film was its budget, not the story. It's The Fall of the House with The Seven Flowers in the Attic. If you read, you'll be able to see how many disappointing ripoffs were given such a superficial picture. Some people might find this amusing, but I don't think you're sure of the group of messages that will be taken from it and that's not what an artist's approach to expression is.",0,0,Elizabeth Athineu,oquZifON8Eg,0.12292358803986711,2015-10-22 23:32:09,False,True
