2019-06-05T12:47:31,"This trailer seemed to show the whole movie. I hate trailers like this. Generally the reason why I don't watch trailers at all.    The things we **DO** know and watching the *trailer* tells us.    * It starts with character development and ""immersive bonding"", we'll see Brad ""upvote"" his father, meaning utmost resepect held. I can guarantee that Brad is likable in this movie as he's the protagonist the audience will bond with. His survival or at least actions matter to the audience.    * Brad has followed the footsteps of his father and is an astronaut on a mission on ISS (or similar space station) during which The Surge will occur. It's a huge thing, likely solar flare, but it could in theory also be an EMP caused by humans. Nothing indicates to that, so I'm going to bet on massive solar flare / celestial source.    * Brad falls and survives - how we don't know, but does it matter. He survives and recovers.    * Army is about to send Brad on a mission after his father whom got lost 16 years ago -> meaning Army has got some indication that something is going on out there.    * Wife worries about Brad before he's sent out to said Army mission.    * Mission prepares, Brad is good, but oh boy - the things he's about to experience during the mission.    * Scene on the Moon (or a massive barren asteroid) occurs, where we can see multiple vehicles and 10+ people.    * We're present around Saturn (rings) where EVA occurs. There's something that takes us to the Saturn. Accident or purposal?    * Another explosion occurs during the mission which Brad also narrowly escapes.    The things we **DO NOT** know and watching the *movie* will tell us:    * What causes The Surge?  * How does Brad survive The Surge?  * Why Brad's father was part of the E.T. mission 16 years ago?  * What did they find initially? What has been going on there all these years?  * Why does the <whatever happened out there> threat Earth and all other life?  * Why is there a plethora of people on the Moon/barren asteroid and there's fighting going on there?  * How do we get to Saturn and EVA there?  * Why is Brad chosen on this mission? Speculation: Related to his father -- knowledge of his father --> indicates father is alive and part of cause.  * Does Brad survive in the end of the movie? Does Earth survive? How about life? How does that happen?    Now the real question is:    Would you have rather watched this movie where you did not know the all the things the trailer revealed?",1,0,Artifex 28,P6AaSMfXHbA,0.03815789473684211,2019-06-05 12:47:31,True,True

When its just about outer space.   Interstellar was probably the last good movie i saw but it still lacked that 'alien' type of plot i wanted.   No offense.  But most sci fi movies lately have been ultra goddamn cheesy as hell. I want my goddamn aliens movies. Goddang it. Why is it hard for you movie producers.    Heres an idea. Ill help you.
