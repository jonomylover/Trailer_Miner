The Transcendence program was originally docile, logical, calculating machine; like an actually artificial intelligence. Originally it was going to learn the ultimate ways to end the greatest tragedies Humanity has ever faced, then what happened, what caused it to become viciously hostile? Will, a human with thoughts, experiences, a life, happened. It is not a superior intelligence that woke the machine's violent, it is actually Human consciousness that triggered it. Transcenedence's existence did not cause it to ""fix"" the humans, it was Will (Humanism) that gave it the passion to hurt, kill even, to make the humans better. Will, by becoming Transcendence, gave it the ability to long, philosophise, hate, desire (everything that makes us Human) and also the ability to kill, control, and reproduce in the masses. I do not believe that the movie is trying to say ""TECHNOLOGY IS BAD"" i believe they are saying that transhumanism is bad, the believe that we can end aging, suffering, and fear by becoming one with our technology. ",8,0,TheBurningIceCream,QheoYw1BKJ4,-0.08333333333333333,2014-02-12 03:28:14,True,True

Will all this movies about ""Invasions"" be a preparation for this fight? like Nazi Propaganda in modern times? also in this Bible and other ""Religious"" books they talk about how humanity got corrupted to a point where the ""Supreme Beings from up above"" came down to earth and wiped all of us out to start from zero again, also the Hopi indians talk about this. Can we trust the books and stories from the past? written by who knows who? or do we trust the writers of modern times, influenced by who knows who? where to go? what to trust? what to believe? or we just seat and relax with popcorn watching the whole world burn? if you see me I see you.

It is just enough that people get this information officially in news. They will ask whether giving such an information was a right choice, but the machine would also start to understand that starting of a discussion as an intrigue it can use. People now are working on a lot more sophisticated thing, than transcendence, the source code, or the eagle eye project. Yet they cannot release it, because it is not full and the problem is that the same process of selfcreating that made the project evolve would cause a disaster as working.
