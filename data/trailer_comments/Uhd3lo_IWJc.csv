Yes, there was some good stuff, it did realistically portray high school, although most of the actors were per usual too old to play high schoolers, but I guess it‚Äôs really hard to find actual teenagers to play teenagers, well. For example Billie Lourde, who was the best part of the movie, is 27 and looks 27, the movie just loses credibility with that. And Beanie Feldstein was just so damn annoying, I guess that was the purpose of her character so kudos for the good acting, but she was just way too unlikable, at least for me.
