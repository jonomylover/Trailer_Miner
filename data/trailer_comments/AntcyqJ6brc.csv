Optimus as shown in the trailer is in deep space searching for the creators. The beasts in the begining were not dino-bots, most likely predacons, as explained in TF:Prime. Optimus is not dead, most likely in stasis, and the Narrator is most likely King Arthur or the current US leader. The giant robot swinging the sword for one scene is most likely Megatron, as he is confirmed as Megatron (not Galvatron) and is in a new body (how is up for debate) And Mark or Bee does not die in the last scene it shows bee quickly raising his arm so he could be injured but most likely not killed (they couldnt kill Bee but who knows anymore) And to touch up on the Nemisis Prime, he could be made of Dark Energon but its not confirmed, as it could also be decepticon or human made (insert terrible TF:4 Galvatron joke here) and is most likely the main villian, except for the giant planet-type thing moving near the moon (If you know what that is please do tell id love to know).

I'm not saying the movie is automatically going to be terrible (who knows, they might have actually learned a thing or two) but as someone who once thought this series was pretty cool and fun, I've lost my patience. This trailer looks and sounds practically identical to the teasers for the last three films: the jump cuts, the brooding soundtrack, the brief shots of random ""awesome moments"", and once again, they're leading us to believe this is going to the ultimate conflict that will change everything for everyone. Well, the last three entries didn't change squat, and considering Paramount already has a Bumblebee spin-off film AND an official sixth entry planned for 2018 and 2019, I think it's safe to say this movie will do nothing but give the fans what they want.

In the comics and Cartoons Optimus ventures out on his own just like he did at the end of Transformers 4. In the comics, he runs out of energon and becomes dosile and frozen. The Quintessons ,which are the creators of the transformer race, eventually run into him and bring him back to life, but  not before re-programming to do there wishes. So Optimus is not neccesrily evil now, hes just programmed to do what ever they want. He does get glimpses of his core autobot tho, which is why he says ""forgive me"" in the trailer. Also, if you think unicron has something to do with prime being evil, you are wrong.

I feel like they can't kill him, being one of two original characters from the first movie, and becuase he has a huge fan base, even  with point number 2 2. Bumblebee never had too much character in these movies compared to his other forms from Prime and Animated, or even Ironhide from the movie verse, he just isn't very interesting to me anymore.  The first movie came out when I was either 6 or 7 and i loved it, being my only exposure with transformers.  looking back, i still love the first movie, but the rest have fallen from their former glory for me.

The last few Transformer movies have been really slow with how things happen. For me it's too much of a cut paste kinda movie. And for the religious side of it all. Where is our God saving us from the EVIL Decepticons. Decepticons that is a cool word. Just break it down and see why that is an awesome name for a EVIL bunch of machines that Transform from one object to another. Some even do more than 1 transformation. Sky Scream - It is a male Android, a gun, and a fighter jet.(yes details are short). the real reason why these movies do so well is because they can be played in multiple countries around the world and they don't have to really change anything except for the language. But most of talking is done before hand and is hidden off screen.  So that is why all these superhero (shooter movies) propaganda pieces do so well. Optimus Prime can be any language they want it to speak in. Hollywood is just redoing things over and over again. These SAGA type movies really can go on forever and never end.

2016-12-06T10:53:15,"I never thought I'd say this, but this trailer is actually really good. Think about it, we got a great cast, there looks to be a coherent plot, the main female character doesn't seem to have been Michael Bayified, the music was pretty good, the action looks really cool, there wasn't any Michael Bay humor... Could this actually be the first *good* Transformers movie? While I think the first one was ok, it's still not a very good movie. But this has a lot of potential, and while the other Transformers trailers also looked cool, none of them have been as good as this one. And besides, this film has Anthony Hopkins in it, what could go wrong? Well ok, a lot of things could go wrong looking at Michael Bay's filmography and his track record. But my main reason as to why I think this film could be great is because Michael Bay could be turning into a better director, if you watch his latest film 13 Hours, you will be surprised at how good it is. With that film, it looked as if Michael Bay was actually *trying* to make a good film. And it worked, because it was actually really good. Seriously, the man hasn't made a good movie since The Rock (Very underrated). But this year he's actually been doing pretty well as a director and as a producer: 13 Hours was really good, TMNT 2 was bad but not nearly as terrible as the original, and the Ouija prequel turned out to be great. What I'm trying to say is that I genuinely think this could be great, and I *hope* it is.

I could barely focus on any dialogue because of that, it's basically the 'scratching your nails on the blackboard' version of the Inception ""Bwoam"".   Also why is it so hard to make a trailer that doesn't give away the plot?  The film takes place in the future, Optimus has left and once again theres a small band of autobots trying to survive against what appears to be security drones designed to wipe them out.  Optimus is in space frozen, and most likely gets found by the planet thing, which I know is Unicron even though I really don't want it to be and he's turned evil by it or is at least controlled by it.   Optimus and Unicron (seriously, thats the look they're going for? I just threw up a little)  come back to earth and they have to fight to stop him.    Basically 75% of the plot points of the film are in that trailer including Optimus attacking them.  Whats wrong with leaving a surprise for your audience anymore?  Why does everything have to be revealed in the trailer now?    Did you see the Force Awakens trailer last year?

2016-12-06T16:35:02,I don't know if you guys will see this but I hope you do. It involves the story. So the stuff you see in the football stadium is a flashback to the distruction that happened in Chicago back in the 3rd movie. Optimus left to find his creators and he eventually does which leads to him finding out that he is the reason that cybertron is dead and the only way to bring it back to life is by using an artifact on earth that relates to King Arthur. In the process he gets brainwashed which leads to him fighting Bumblebee. This movie is gonna be awesome because we learn about the origin of cybertron and the transformers. We also learn more about the history of the primes and the transformers' connection with earth. Anyways I hope you guys see this,2,0,Cleopatra VII,AntcyqJ6brc,0.1625,2016-12-06 16:35:02,True,True

Optimus realises he needs to go back and refit the time line so he once again sets off to find the relic he used to reset the timeline.

2016-12-07T00:43:43,"The Information and some theories that might be true: now in the trailer we see shocking things, first off, I'm making this because I see so many people's attention on bumblebees death and this comment will tell them what may be REALLY GOING ON. SO here are the question I am answer these questions: What in the world is that giant planet that looks like it's about to eat the moon?! My answer: There can be only 2 answers. 1. Unicron is here. 2. New cybertron made by the creators of Optimus? My best answer would be Unicron, because we know that Unicron is a massive planet eater and that planet really seems like it's next tasty meal is the moon. But IT COULD BE CYRBERTRON! Because I have never knew about anything of a planet spreading its self to piece and sort of spreading them around the planet, and eat it? But it's might be Unicron! The 2nd question: Optimus died and came back to life but ATTACKED BUMBLEBEE AND MIGHT HAVE KILLED HIM?! And why did he say ""forgive me...""? My answer: We see that in the beginning he is dead, all out of energon (for those of you that don't know what energon is, it is the blood of all transformers and how they stay alive) but Optimus was deep in space... how is he back? Only one answer: Unicron. Unicron must've found Optimus and brought him back to life, but in the end he attacked bumblebee?! The second answer that applies to the first: OPTIMUS IS CORRUPTED! Now I know what some of you might think, ""ITS NEMESIS PRIME!"" It's not. As at the end we look into his eyes and they seem purple. If you have not watch the transformer shows or games, Dark energon brings transformers back to life, but either zombified (sorta) or under Unicrons control. OPTIMUS IS NOT ZOMBIFIED BUT INFECTED under control by Unicron! For those of you who watch Transformers Prime, Unicron was controlling Megatron setting a goal to bring him back. But failed. In the movie Unicron is using Optimus! But I don't know the reason why, it is maybe because Optimus can kill the transformers since he has great power or Optimus could be the only one... or is there another...? Which brings to the next question, 1:38 1:48 WHO IS THAT BADASS LOOKING DECEPTICON OR AUTOBOT?! My OFFICIAL AND TRUE ANSWER: now don't get me wrong on who this is. ITS Megatron or Galvatron because now all of you would be like ""Megatron or Galvatron doesn't use a sword! He doesn't use a shield!"" Well in the 4th movie Galvatron says: ""we shall meet again prime... FOR I AM REBORN."" But! He might no longer be a Decepticon! He walked away in the jungle and must've found the ship where Optimus got his sword and where Cade got his alien gun. Galvatron must've claimed a sword, a shield, and A new look! Maybe armour? Who knows! But in 1:38 his eyes were red, and in 1:48 his eyes were grey-ish or blue-ish, GALVATRON IS BECOMING GOOD?! In 1:48 Him and Cade seemed to be making a deal, but it was on Cade, he seemed like Cade wanted Galvatron to help stop Unicron or stop Optimus or both. Also, since when did Galvatron knew how to use a sword? Well, it's kinda obvious, the ship must've never been found where Optimus got his sword, and Galvatron must've had enough time to train himself. Now he is prepared to face Optimus or Unicron. Another thing ""The Last Knight"" Galvatron could be The Last Knight? Or Optimus? Or another unknown Transformer!",0,0,WTF Lemmar,AntcyqJ6brc,0.05273944805194806,2016-12-07 00:43:43,True,True

2016-12-07T04:23:04,"Okay here is my official breakdown of the trailer: In the beginning, we see knights riding into battle, and then a giant dragon transformer. I'm not sure who the dragon robot is, but from the looks of the knight riding alongside the dragon, i can make two predictions about it. 1; the dragon is making a deal with the knight, similar to how lock-down made a deal with the agent from the previous movie, or 2; The dragon is a depiction of dragons from famous myths and stories about a knight slaying a dragon, and thats what the knight is doing. We continue with more flashbacks to previous wars, most likely having something to do with the fact that the transformers have been here since the birth of mankind, and that these wars were really between man and machine. Okay lets continue to the crashed satellite and the children. This will most likely happen later in the movie, with satellites falling from space because of the planet-monster thing (possibly Unicron?) The children were probably caught in the crossfire of the great battle happening between the decepticons and the autobots. Moving on to the child and the dying autobot. Im not yet sure who the autobot is but it looks like a friend to the child. The giant hole thing is most likely the planet monster that has yet to have been identified. Prime is in outer space. The man goes over the rune which is most likely an insignia from the knights we saw first in the trailer. Next we see the child again with everyone's favorite robot squeeks, who is an autobot. This covers the first quarter of the trailer, let me know if you would like a further analysis!

I actually had high hopes for this film after how bad ""Dark of the Moon"" and ""Age of Extinction"" were. They lacked the soul and essence of Transformers. Honestly I loved the first film and viewed it as a *gasps* ""masterpiece"" for a number of reasons. Many may disagree but I was blown away. It took my breath away and gave me a feeling that was up there with Star Wars when I first saw it. All the special effects, unique direction. The film was literally art. For all the flaws the ""Revenge of the Fallen"" had. I found that the film was actually better on the 2nd and 3rd watch. I was angry with how they treated Megaton, but it didn't go full out of character like the other two films.  Personally I feel like I could write a much better film than the latest couple films, though I can't direct worth shit. Honestly Micheal Bay is horribly wrong about one thing. I believe he claimed that he could never make a film that focuses just on the Auto-Bots because without the humans in the film there would be no humanity or any way for the audience to connect with the characters. He is so wrong. The fans connected to the Transformers in the shows and the comics because they had more personality and depth to their characters. A deeper story for us to delve into. This is one of his huge fallacies. He can easily create a film both connecting us with the Transformers and still have his big action moments. Personally I would think about either making the series two or three trilogies with each film in the trilogy being a major story arc with a trilogy theme and beats to connect it as a whole. That wouldn't even fill half the content.   Trilogy One: Transformers Trilogy Two: The Beast Wars Trilogy Three: Beast Machines (this could probably be done in one or two films tbh)  Seriously Bay, you can do better.

2016-12-07T06:17:10,"Optimus prime most likely killed some one that had dark energon and was to close and was inffected.   Info on dark energon....The violet-glowing Dark Energon supercharges any Transformer who ingests it, making them stronger, faster, more powerful...and more aggressive. It turns pain into pleasure, rendering any blows inflicted on a user futile and heals their wounds as well. However, it also acts as a powerful narcotic, filling the user with thrilling, dark sensations and causing addiction. Dark Energon withdrawal turns the user into a raving brute desperate to do anything for more. If the craving is not satisfied, the user devolves to a beast-like state and eventually dies. Those who imbibe Dark Energon have been seen to project it from their bodies for various destructive purposes, such as attacking enemies, overloading computers, and bringing machines under their control. When a user is killed, the energy acts like a sentient thing (a worrying aspect for a force originating from Unicron) and flies from their corpse to empower any other user nearby.  And no it is not a copy of optimus or any other Transformer due to the fact that optimus says ""forgive me"" before taking a swing at bumblebee.",1,0,Kevin Santos,AntcyqJ6brc,-0.024999999999999998,2016-12-07 06:17:10,True,True

Also factor in how much people have become emotionally attached with him and we could have a brilliant scene that pulls on everyone's heart strings thus providing a excellent emotional scene for fans of the films and the character.  Take ""Transformers Prime"" for example.  The scene where Bumblebee dies is (imo) the best emotional scene we got.  When we as fans saw that unfold a lot of us started to cry.  Why? because the show had done such a good job of developing the characters and giving fans a reason to attach their feelings with them that when it actually happened we couldn't help but let it out.

This could have possibly led him to drift off toward an unknown area of space and he's picked up by, dare I say his name, Unicron. The Devourer of Worlds takes control of Optimus and sends him back to Earth to do some bad deeds.   Nemesis Prime theory: Optimus does in fact make it to the ""Creators,"" battles them to the best of his ability but he ultimately loses. Because they want him back (Lockdown reference), they send a copy or clone, of Optimus back to Earth where the copy can lay down some hurt on the humans, Autobots, and Decepticons all together without having to stain their own hands.

Also do any of you remember in the last move age of extinction How prime says ""This is a message to my creators leave planet earth alone because im coming for you"". DOES THAT NOT SOUND SHAKY?!??! In this new trailer prime is floating in space looking like he got his ass kicked by his ""creators"" and they have sent him back to erase the transformers race on planet earth which is why it seems like he killed bumblebee. This all just seems weird but guys just know prime is being controlled just look at his eyes they appear purple and i think he still has some of him left in him because he says why killing bumblebee ""forgive me"" I honesty cant wait to see this movie it looks like its gonna be super fun to watch but thats all i know from being a fan on this series since i was young so im looking forward to watching this MICHAEL BAY STRIKES AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!",0,0,Sagee4,AntcyqJ6brc,0.07358472935565107,2016-12-09 00:35:00,True,True

And throughout the trailer they're a ton of cybertronian 'structures' being unearthed, The scene at 1:40 shows the hexagonal pattern much like Cybertron has, and at the very end Optimus has purple Dark Energon infused eyes and are fighting in some kind of massive access port which I suspect will be leading to Unicron.   The scene with Optimus fighting Bumbleee I suspect is near the end/middle. They're trying to head into the earths core to stop Unicron from waking up and 'shaking the earth off' much like Transformers Prime. But Unicron possess Optimus and forces him to defend the access port.

I believe that the three-headed dragon is Scourge who holds the jungle planet Animatron, which I think is the planet we see overtaking the moon and reaching Earth. It would actually tie into the theory of Unicron coming up soon in the films. I also think that Optimus has been affected by Dark Energon which is why his eyes are purple and he is fighting against the Autobots. I think the little girl's significance is that the Autobot that she was leaning against and looking at as he was down is her protector. Similar to Bumble Bee and Sam (Shia LaBeouf). I believe that the Decepticon walking @ 1:38 is Galvatron who is now Megatron, since he took over.   EDIT: Also @ 1:51 we see Optimus Prime's eyes turn back to blue, which strengthens the theory that he was possessed by Dark Energon.  That's all I can gather from my point of view.

Optimus gives an even more american freedom speach, then Bay hits the reset button for the next generic movie that has no weight because only ""randomly appeared out of nowhere"" new sidecharacters die that nobody cares about at all, maybe mildly interesting because had ONE cool scene just so Bay can think ""yes, now the people are attached"".

Now, people may be thinking, ""well they might just be that similar,"" seeing as how they are both inside the universe, but here is proof. In the g1 episode, a seemingly good Optimus says, ""Forgive Me"", before attempting to kill Hot Rod. This is the same here, with bumblebee. Hot Rod survived in the episode, and if the two continue to be linked might mean that Bumblebee might survive in what we see.",0,0,Tiny Elvis,AntcyqJ6brc,0.05216942148760329,2016-12-10 03:46:13,True,True

2016-12-10T14:21:42,"This needs an epic reboot. Michael Bay's version of transformers needs to be tossed. The writing and dialogue sucked for the first 4 films.¬†Sure the cartoon was no better when it came to intellectual¬†and well thought out script and plot, but it was for kids. What is Bay's excuse for ruining the franchise? Oh that is right, you make more money selling to the masses who have an average intelligence and short attention span. Insert more explosions and endless fight scenes here (along with transforming sound effects CheShishoowhooo)_______________!!!!!¬†¬†¬†Just a few things I would have done differently. 1.Omega Supreme (smarter version) would be involved. 2.Teleportation rings that opened a reasonably small gateway for travel back to Cybertron, would exist. ¬†3.The Quintessons would be discovered. 4. The script¬†would include more lines and dialogue between the Transformers and way less from the Humans, including less major human roles. I swear rich people everywhere paid their way onto the movie, just to have a small bit that was completely unneeded and drew away from the main plot.¬†5. Put action in it, but not to the point where it is just stupidly haywire. 6. Place the arc on earth, under a mountain. 7. Show that the other prime's consciousness is still in the matrix, along with all of their knowledge and show how the matrix, creates a stronger version the transformer holding it. They could even show a kind of astral projection into the matrix, when prime is meditating or looking for answers.",0,0,Shawn Bechard,AntcyqJ6brc,0.09355158730158732,2016-12-10 14:21:42,True,True

Makes me somewhat hopeful that this isn't the end of Bumblebee. Also, I haven't read or seen everything regarding this trailer but, I haven't seen anyone mention anything about the fact that Optimus's eyes change their color from blue to purple during the scenes we see him fighting Bumblebee. Could this indicate he's being controlled by Unicron or something along those lines?

2016-12-11T11:43:53,"Optimus Prime went to find the creators in the last movie in which he left Bumblebee in charge on planet Earth.  If you look good in the trailer how the hell Optimus prime is frozen in space if they can survive in that enviorment?  If you look well the area where Optimus Prime wake up you  will notice that the environment is a bit like Cybertron but the reality is the space craft of unicron and because is equal to the comics and old animated film.  If you look well and listen, you will notice that the holes that normally has Optimus Prime at first they disappear when he is fighting Bumblebee, one of the theory is that he is always updating his body and if you listen well when he says forgive you can se the eyes are violet and not like he usually have them (BLUE) or when he wake up in the beginning of the trailer but in that setting if you stare at ther Sword it passes between the head of the boy and Bumblebee which can be a distraction for the creator of them to save them or commit suicide as he has done before but in the end he will be alive because of the Matrix.  Also is the theory that that is his twin brother Ultra Magnus Prime who is doing that and optimus prime is kidnapped by unicron, but Ultra Magnus has respect for the Autobots although he is not the prime's favorite.  There are many theories and yes I am very fanatic of the transformers and I know all the movies by memory and I am annoyed enough to see in the comments that someone put in Transformers The Revenge of Fallen that they already had the arms to defeat the transformers in which on that Movie were still not created entirely because they are still using common guns and when they started to create those weapons was in the last film Transformers The Age of Extinction since in that movie they were tracking them to kill them with a more advanced technology since Lockdown gave them part Of that technology and already for that film were already building their own transformers and there are more understanding that they already had the weapons to defeat them on that film.  And if you do not know the story of the transformers or the names or something do not comment please there are fans that do know and they will get annoyd if you comment something stupid as if you know everything if you do not know please do not say anything because those movies are continue for their fans and for those who are watching and reading Everything to be a fan  like us if you do not like and you do not care please do not say anything and if you like a movie and  not the others and you say that you are fanatic, you really are not because a real fanatic Loves all the movies even if others say that they are not   ok there is what I think and the theories of Transformer The Last Knight as well as the other movies thank you",1,2,Momo 20j,AntcyqJ6brc,0.04258620689655173,2016-12-11 11:43:53,True,True

2016-12-13T09:27:37,For those of you that think Bumblebee dies just R E L A X. I know exactly what will happen here. Optimus is being controlled by something here I'm going to guess Unicron. But if you watch closely enough at the end of this scene it appears Bumblebee catches his sword or whatever. I'm guessing this will be a VERY bada** fight probably the best in the movie. Bumblebee will win here no doubt. He will beat Optimus so bad Optimus realizes he is doing wrong and the control over him just goes away and BAM Optimus is good again. Then Optimus and Bumblebee find Unicron and fight him together. Save this post and remember who called it!,0,0,Bradley Walker,AntcyqJ6brc,0.24062500000000003,2016-12-13 09:27:37,True,True

But you can expect that by that. (He has purple eyes if you dont know what i mean)  But what really dissapoints me about this movie. Is simple Unicron design. I was expecting they will keep Unicron's some basic details. Like huge robot with horns. Or planet with those horn thingies near the mouth. But.. this? This popcorn planet? It really dissapointed me. (for entire show i will say its Unicorn or Planetcorn)  I mean i like the dramatic music but please.. why killing the most fav and famous characters.

I think the prime some how comes back from space as shown in the trailer with prime having green eyes plus if u look at primes condition u can see that he is all dirty and in bad condition. But in the last clip u can see that prime is all well and good and his eyes are purple. I think that the nemuis prime is portraying as prime and is trying to kill everybody.

Both sides fight each other, and the big bad, and a lot of good guys get wrecked, but ultimately one of the lesser Autobots takes over possession of the Matrix, kicks ass, and becomes the new leader of the Autobots. I can see them melding this into the new movie, but making Bumblebee the new Ubermech in the story, since someone is going to have to put OPtimus down at the end, if things go as they seem.

The first film was Great, but each one has gone downhill since as they forgot what the whole Transformers series is about - ITS A TWO HOUR TOY COMMERCIAL!  That said, The trailer has managed to do something that NONE of the other shave managed to do... Its actually got my interest!  God when will Hasbro get it together though? TMNT 2: Out of teh Shadows is NOT a great movie by any means... But I watched it the other night and its enjoyable!!! Its enjoyable because its stays true to what it is - An Extended Toy Commercial! Nothing about that film is serious... Its a total Joke and thats what it should be!!!  The same should be true of Transformers... In fact, Even while Watching this trailer, I came up with a Treatment for 4 Movies that would stay true to the original Cartoon while at teh same time making a great Michael Bay Action Epic... But BE A TWO HOUR TOY COMMERCIAL as long as Hasbro REMEMBERS WHAT KIDS LOVE ABOUT TOYS! (Yeah Hasbro, Those One Step Flip Changers - F**K OFF!)  Will this be a Good Film... Well, its going to be action packed, I know that... Will I see it... Yes, My Son will never forgive me if I don't... Will its be what we are all hoping for....  Simple answer... NO!

2017-01-15T04:46:23,"1:00 1:22 Look very similar to the Quintesson Ship in the original series. I really think the villains in this movie are the Quintessons. Lockdown was sent after Optimus in AOE by them. Optimus flies into space to confront them and runs out of energon before he gets there. Quintessons find him and revive him with Dark Energon. Optimus becomes Nemesis Prime under their control. They go to Earth for whatever macguffin they're looking for. I think the shot at 1:22 is a bait and switch made to look like Unicron. The problem with that Unicron is completely spherical in planet form. That ship is elongated, the round part being only the front of the ship.

2017-01-24T07:55:15,Guys I'm no saw all 4  installments but I pieced together that the bad prime is not Optimus at all. I say this because the auto bot or good guy symbol is Optimus' s head with blue eyes but the deception symbol looks like the bad Optimus head which both have purple eyes. And we see that both have different armor. And lastly we see Optimus with blue eyes get up out of debris maybe saying he comes back to earth and lastly I do know from lore that an almost clone of Optimus known as nemesis prime that could be this guy and nemesis prime does lack morality.

Megatron and the decepticons were going after it, so how is that not a good storyline?

2017-04-28T01:22:52,"*BUMBLEBEE I HEAR YOU!!!* I thought this would be a good time to copy and paste this i posted on *watchman of the harvest's page* and other prophecy pages. *FYI go to the ""tidal basin"" in DC under google earth pro. Lookup historical imagery for 10/2014... What do you see hiding in the field by the Veteran's park? Looks like the *FACE of the son of the 'leopord/akenaten' to me...* But what do I know? my head is a ""empty jar."" ;) Me jarhead...  I dedicate this vision from the *LORD JESUS CHRIST* to ""warriorwoman."" Long live strong women for CHRIST. You give us MEN strength.. under GOD. Amen...  *The Holy Ghost brought me to your page and this is being repeatedly deleted off other posts via ""youtube hereos"" like Scott Clarke's rev 12 post and Thegroxt1 ""michael the archangel/sword post*  17 is the number of the OVERCOMER... I have OVERCOME tattooed on my shooting arm... I was born on the 17th, my garage number is 17, I went on 3 7-month combat tours with the ""devil dogs"" chasing the ""dragon"" all over the seas of the middle east. My platoon also had a ""John"" he was a ""lamp"" for us. He sacrificed his life for us on his 3rd 7 month tour,  and he was my ""fire team leader."" 2nd Marine Division's insignia is a hand holding a torch. Our motto is ""Follow me."" When I left the Marines I took a road to my ex fiancee's house that had ""John's last name as the street name. Her family name is ""Wisdom,"" Her family did not believe in the Christ and I always did. It led to our break up do to her lack of faith. I left that ""wisdom"" and got down on my knees in my darkest hour and asked for the Wisdom of Solomon and the Spirit of David. In 2016, I started visioning like spoke about in Corinthians Chp 12-14. Now in 2017, this year seems like Christ is giving me clarity to my visions and prophecy, and like other Christians on here... Im finding there are more of us ""watchmen for the Lord,"" like spoke about in Ezekiel 33. I am 33 years of age in 2017. I also find myself in ""life parrallels"" with reflective parts of the 4 books of Kings and my family. I can also hear the Lord through music and He can literally take over my radio and play a song and ""lyrically"" answer the question for me. Kinda like *Bumblebee* in transformers would use the Radio to talk to Sam."" I owned the same car and my father's nickname for his dog was *bumblebee. Transformers 2007 prophetic hint  THE LORD TOLD ME TO POP THIS MOVIE IN MY BLU RAY PLAYER ON 3/7/2017.* Sam was a ""prophet"" like SAMUEL in the Books of Kings. Sam took a ""ride"" with the Holy Ghost (played by bumblebee) They get chased around by the nephilim/decepticons looking for the allspark/vault7... 7s everywhere throughout the movie...Sam's grandpa held the secret in his glasses/eyes... Grandpa wikwiki= Wiki leaks... They have to save the world from ""the black cube/saturnalia' with the autobots/angels... They burrow underground and we see them after ""ancient tech"" that has CERN references everywhere. Shia labouf is a mk ultra baby, and Bearnie Mac was a good Christian man that was a Hollywood actor that didn't drink their ""kool aid."" He died shortly after, still in his prime... from a ""heart attack."" The director is ""Micheal Bay,"" The LORD will keep the Archangel ""Michael"" at ""bay"" when its time for the ""Dragon"" to do his destruction like in Revelation... Michael Bay literally was just in the news for ""catching a thief"" trying to break into his ""neighbor's house.""      Didnt Jesus Say?  1 Thessalonians 5 (KJV)  But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.  Acts 2:17 ""your children will prophecy""  Proverbs 27:17 Iron sharpens Iron  Revelation 2:17  17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.  Thank you for the insight, teacher. You got yourself a new subscriber. Semper Fi.  btw... if anybody wants to know my first name...CHECK ACTS 17:7.... Just like the LORD SHOWED ME...

On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.  The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.  Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.""  ~Carl Sagan, The Pale Blue Dot",0,0,Pranav Mehta,AntcyqJ6brc,0.10775000000000004,2017-04-29 11:01:53,True,True

And going for a humans vs the alien machine angle at least Bay didn't turn Unicron into a smoke cloud or a giant female transformer with giant tits(assuming it is Unicron and not Primus or Cybertron itself). But the overall problem is that the transformers film franchise in of itself is the story is all over the map, most of the human characters are either idiots or stereotypes, and the plots seems secondary where as the special effects, fights, and explosions are primary granted it's Michael Bay expecting any real story from him is like expecting a snake head fish becoming an alge eater.  Basically the whole film franchise is an identity crisis it's too adult for kids to enjoy and yet the ""comedy"" is too childish for adults to tolerate, and the story is horrendous, the allspark being some magic mulligan which does whatever Bay wants it to do such as giving life to non cybertronian technology, killing and resurrecting other transformers, and giving cybertronian knowledge to organic life forms yet unable to read the language despite being edowed with cybertronian knowledge.

2017-05-27T13:57:40,"What everyone here needs to realize is that what's happened to Optimus Prime is what he was on his way to becoming anyway so I don't think it's a big deal! Think about it. From the beginning, the largest theme IMHO of this series is the utilitarian vs. Kantian ideologies (with the latter being held by Prime in all of his incarnations as well as in the first movie). Galloway was supposed to embody the former in TF2 and it was supposed to be a great clash of ideals between him and Prime until TF2 totally dropped the ball with it! Then Optimus, and even the Bayformers fans, started to become hypocritical thanks to the third and fourth movie (the latter most of all), as OP himself leans closer and closer to the other spectrum. None was more evident when Cemetery Wind and KSI (both arguably taking up the Kantian role) tried to put an end to the whole war, all the suffering, and all the loss in AoE when they tried to destroy both factions themselves--they did have the motivation after all since most of their loved ones were lost in the Battle of Chicago, making them not so unsympathetic IMO. It'll be nice to see that continue in this film with the TRF taking up CW's role and the fact that one of the main characters, Izabella, was orphaned from the Battle of Chicago (which spawned CW and in turn the TRF). However, whereas Optimus would've usually found a way to resolve the tensions and conflict between his team and these desperate human groups in Age of Extinction, he has now instead fully tipped over to the other side of that ideology in TLK, none more evident when he says ""For my world to live, yours must die.""

(if you don't listen to people, don't claim that you love them) 2. The message is the Gospel which is compelling to believe.   (a Father gave his son for a sacrifice) 3. The death of the sinless Christ makes the sinner to evaluate his life and repent.  4. Because it is inherently good news, it is to be confessed and proclaimed to be such.  5. The cross stands for the Gospel, 1 Cor 1:18ff, which is more fully the death, burial, and resurrection, 1 Cor 15:1-4, which must be obeyed. In baptism the sinner obeys the Gospel, the death, burial and resurrection which makes him new.  When we preach the Gospel of Jesus, people get baptized, Acts 8:12; Acts 8:36ff.

The movie revolves around the descendant of Merlin who is the only one to hold the staff that combines both Cybertron and Earth. Nemesis Prime is a thing, even if only for 5 minutes of screen time. Unicron is hinted at throughout the movie and is finally said at the end by ""The Creator"" in a post credit. WW2 is a 10 second long scene that involves Bumblebee ""winning the war"". The movie is long, but visually satisfying (like every other Transformers movie- the reason why people see them). The ending contains possibly the largest ""WTF is going on"" moment with a battle occuring on Cybertron (with Transformers and Humans) as it is crashing down over Stonehenge with a dogfight happening overhead.

But nah this one was a mess with so many plot holes and subplots it should've been 2 movies. They screwed up with unicron and quintessa which foesnt explain those ships at the beginning of the 4th movie. Nemesis prime was a let down the action was little and happened to fast and zippy to register as all the transformers movies. Mark wahlberg being the last night was dumb even tho mark is awesome the movie was as if someone put a bunch if trailers together for 2:30 hours and min. But I'm not hating I'm just saying in this day in age in this era of cinema with movies from marvel, action from john which and mad max, visuals like interstellar etc. Transformers can do way better. Again I'm not hating I love these movies they are entertaining especially the first 2.

2018-09-05T21:05:37,"2 Corinthians 11:14- ‚ÄúAnd NO MARVEL; for Satan himself is TRANSFORMED into an angel of light.‚Äù      Optimus prime (Light bearer) or Lucifer and his fellow autobots/demons can transform themselves into other machines like cars and act in good faith for the people. My understanding of optics is that it deals with light, also, Lucifer means bringer of light. Then Optimus prime must mean Lucifer prime. Marvel produces such kind of movies that base on the metaphysical world, aliens, supernaturalism and mystical views. You can say Satan is sick because of his split personality of being good and evil, but you may be wrong, because Satan knows very well when to transform and why, he is in full control of himself because of freedom from God. What he does is tear himself up into two parties that conflict each other, the good and bad, so that he attracts even good people. Today you can see the government fighting negative forces, but it is all just a show, because the more they fight, the more the evil grows and they are the ones encouraging it personally. The entertainment industries work against God‚Äôs word just like it appears when the bible says ‚ÄòNo marvel,‚Äô the Marvel entertainment section names itself the opposite of the requirement. As Doctor Ravi Zacharias puts it, Logic is supposed to come through the front door of a human mind at level one, then arts through the backdoor at level two and lastly application level. You are supposed to live and think based on level one, make illustrations for reality at level two and apply in life at level three. But nowadays people live and think at level two and illustrate life using level one before applying in reality. It is evidently seen as the society honors and even to the extreme worships the entertainment icons and celebrities in music, movies and literature industries. The following products of the media under the movie titled transformers will open your eyes only by the aid of God‚Äôs word. i. ‚ÄòAge of Extinction‚Äô Optimus prime says at the end, ‚Äúthese seed belongs to our creators, whoever they are‚Ä¶I shall take it where it can never be found‚Ä¶whenever you look to the stars, think of one of them as my soul‚Ä¶there are mysteries to the universe we were never meant to solve‚Ä¶I am Optmus prime, and this message is to my creators, leave planet earth alone, coz am coming, for you‚Äù o Genesis 1, ‚ÄúIn the beginning God created‚Ä¶‚Äù o Colossians 1:16 ‚ÄúFor by God all things were created‚Ä¶‚Äù o Isaiah 14: 12-17- ‚ÄúFor you have said into your heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God‚Ä¶‚Äù o Ezekiel 28: 12-19 ‚ÄúEvery precious stone was your covering‚Ä¶diamond‚Ä¶gold‚Äù o Psalms 147:4 ‚ÄúHe tells the number of stars, He calls them all by their names.‚Äù o Job 9: 24 ‚ÄúThe world is given into the hands of the wicked‚Ä¶‚Äù Optimus prime says that he is going for his creators, just like Lucifer said he will ascend into heaven and exalt his throne above the angels of God. Optimus and his fellows are made of metal, just like Lucifer who is made of precious stones like diamond and gold as the bible puts it. Diamond is the hardest metal. He says the one of the stars is his soul just like God says He names all the stars and the name stars means angels. So he refers to himself as an angel among angels. And since he is a great matrix of leadership, he represents the great dragon or Satan that leads demons. Optimus demands the creators to leave planet earth alone just like the bible says the earth is given to the wicked. Prime claims ownership of the earth by defending it. ii.  The 2013 Version ‚ÄòDark of The Mi‚Ä¶‚Äô Optimus says ‚Äúwe were once a peaceful race‚Ä¶intelligent‚Ä¶but then came war‚Ä¶autobots for freedom‚Ä¶decepticons for tyranny‚Ä¶outnumbered‚Ä¶our defeat‚Ä¶certain‚Äù The autoboots also say while they are still on earth ‚Äúno one is exiling us‚Ä¶‚Äù o Revelation 12:7-9 ‚ÄúAnd war broke out in heaven‚Ä¶the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail‚Ä¶‚Äù Optimus/Lucifer titles God as a decepticon with tyrant and so he fights for freedom as he puts it. He says they were outnumbered and outmatched during the war for freedom, similarly, the bible says the dragon took 1/3 of the stars/angels with him and they fought God who remained with 2/3 of the angels. Of course, Megatron and his fellow decepticons symbolizes God‚Äôs kingdom as evil according to Lucifer prime. iii. ‚ÄòRevenge of The Fallen‚Äô Optimus says ‚Äú‚Ä¶our worlds have met before‚Ä¶‚Äù. Meaning that there was a time the angels came to earth, as the bible continues to say they met with daughters of men and produced giants that did evil to people. The movie starts when the old decepticons torture and kill people who appear as Africans symbolizing the ancient people like evolutionists points out. Optimus prime fights the prolonged war alongside and with help of the armies of the earth. o Revelation 19: 19 ‚Äú‚Ä¶the earth with their armies gathered to make war against he who sit upon the horse and against his army.‚Äù Satan takes advantage of the good, he pretends to be good with evil intentions, he gives impure love, and everything impure.  The only difference between the state-of-the-art and the old ages is that now people believe what they see and ignore what they don't see and the media takes advantage by giving showing them lies because they just want to see and believe. On the other hand, in the old days, even Jesus came and they saw Him but refused to believe him because they wanted to believe what is invisible. What is wrong with us! The media is supposed to be a character mirror, not a mind bender. People see the opposite of themselves and believe it is really them.",0,0,ERICK KHAEMBA,AntcyqJ6brc,0.046912785490371686,2018-09-05 21:05:37,False,False

Know,the movies are great,the CGI is wayyyyy better.But what I search in movies isn‚Äôt the explosions,the amount of American flags or Hot girls.I look for the cast & Story.For example: The MCU,it‚Äôs my ‚Äòlife‚Äô I adore those movies.The reason for that is pretty simple: The cast & Story. All characters (well most) have their solo movie(s) explaining where they come from,who they are,etc. And as a bonus,the CGI is totally awesome.

2020-05-21T22:59:40,"If I was the screenwriter for the film, or at least the script doctor, I would have this in a way be similar to the first. It's a small story, about a young human's relationship with a Transformer, in a large universe which is recovering from the aftermath of war with the Transformers.   The first act, we get a good amount of time setting up who the girl is and how much she cares about her specific Transformers and maybe a glimpse that she's looking for a family. The inciting incident is maybe about how Megatron or someone abducts the tiny Transformer because he has something important like a message or a map to the creator of the Transformers (I believe they called her Proxima or something). This starts act 2.  In Act 2, this is where we meet Cade or maybe we meet him earlier but she goes up to him after a previous and brief meeting and asks him to help her get her Transformer back.   This leads to all of the action stuff we see in the trailers, gives a tangible reason for Cade and the girl to be around each other, ties in the whole side story with Optimus, and provides some heart to the story. I think it just connects a little better. Bay's movies are rarely boring but almost all of them, specifically the Transformers films, have so much potential.",0,0,Reel Ascension,AntcyqJ6brc,0.036879960317460304,2020-05-21 22:59:40,False,False
