Technology that can gather up to date information on planets light years away.   Aliens that travel between stars don't have to fight us. They exterminate us all by pressing a button while at home before they get here.

2015-10-16T07:22:23,"Honestly, just reading these comments (its sad Youtubers are the worse negative people in the world). You pick and prod at a movie, then compare it to the ""latest"" movies (i.e Hunger Games, The Host etc...). Nothing in this world is ever unique anymore, everything is pretty much done (know this, now) but people are still allowed to take those ""over used ideas"" and make them THEIR OWN.   Hunger Games was freaking based off in the future if the Government was corrupt and thus set up ways to dictate them. Then, ONE girl (as if this is possible but you know what it sells.) Honestly, who here would watch 1984 if it was made now? Its focused on an older man....anyone? I'm pretty sure most of you would not. (i.e The Diary of Anne Frank, The boy in the striped pajamas etc...Wait, that doesn't have action packed scenes or hot love triangle, or even a lot of love making. Damn, the struggle....) The reason why it sets in a perspective of a girl or a teenage guy, whatever, is to grab the attention of the growing population of the younger audience. Plus, people now a days have the lowest attention spans (but no one is trying to throw shots, so please no caps lock).   Also, I have not read the book, but looking through the comments the people who did read it say that it was very well written. There wasn't any love scene (least not a lot) but its used to make the common man watch it. (this is how Fifty Shades and Twilight got popular). Some books turned to movies suffer, like The Giver, because it was just a fresher 1984 pretty much. (though the book was better as I have heard and researched).  Hollywood will only cater to the ""short attention span people"" and not the people who actually want accurate in the book because lets face it those ""less minded people"" are out there more in the world. Its why reality shows keep getting worse. So, before you jump to anything think before you slam your fingers into the keyboard. Give some things a chance and not jump to conclusion. THINK.

Then there will be the ""things are going well montage"" during which the girl will learn to fight and all the other stuff while wanting to jump on the guy's dick.

They'll meet the villain who will explain what, why and how. They'll do some jumps and kicks, the guy might be killed or seriously injured, the girl will be on the brink of tears until she remembers her parents or something someone said before in the movie, will find her strength again and save the day.

If not, I will try to do a short review for you with my not so expanded english. NO SPOILERS AND NO COMPARISON WITH THE BOOK VERSION: All the movie is like ""HEY GUYS! WE HAVE A SCRIPT AND WE HAVE TO MAKE IT FIT IN 2 HOURS OF MOVIE""; it has many holes so most of times you will be like ""what the fuck just happened"" and you will have MANY questions, not in a good misterious way but in a ""they didn't explained shit"" way; they forced A LOT of stuff and events; everything happens so fast and it  makes you just boringly assimilate everything no matter how tragic or awesome it is; character development: JUST NO, you never know real shit about any character, not even the protagonist; overreactions everywhere; here's something good: acting was pretty good (they start kinda overacting in a movie-ish inspiring way at the last half of the movie but it's because of the script, the actors were good), aaand the ambient of every scene was truly amazing, nothing more; End.  Acting: 9.5/10 Scripts: 5/10 Storyline: 6/10 Ambient: 9/10 Character development: 4/10 Sound: 8/10 noting impressive tho Chlo√´: 11/10 IGN but to much water and clothes.  Movie as a whole: 5/10  Adding: NO COMPARISON WITH THE BOOK BUT SPOILERS VERSION *SPOILERS*  DUDE WHAT THE FUCK HER MOM CALLED A FUCKING GUARD TO A SIMPLE THING AS KICK OUT HER DAUGHTER! HOW DOES SHE KNEW IT WAS AN EMP?? OR TSUNAMIS AND NOT JUST A FLOOD?? NOBODY NOTICED HER WHEN SHE WAS LOOKING FOR THE BEAR OR WHEN SHE WAS WATCHING THE FUCKING MASSACRE IN FRONT OF THE FUCKING DOOR! I am not sure when she got the big gun but maybe I just don't remember it. YO GURL! I WILL TEACH YOU A TECHNIQUE TO DISARM SOMEONE THAT DOESN'T REALLY WORKS IN REAL LIFE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW HAND-ANATOMY WORKS AND OUR MOVIE TEAM SUCKS!  Evan is like YOOO! I AM AN ALIEN BUT I SAVED YOU BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF LOVE! <3 #NOTACLICH√âFORSURE. and zombie later: HEY GUYS WHAT IF YOU SHOOT ME TO DISSIMULATE THE MUTINY I WILL NOT EVER TRY TO LIE LATER! At the end Casiopea is like YOOOO I KILLED EVERYONE BUT I AM SURE THAT YOU, BEN, ARE GOOD AND NOT AN ALIEN WITHOUT EVEN ASK YOU ANYTHING AFTER YOU POINTED ME WITH A GUN BECAUSE YOU KNOW... YOU ARE COOL... and then HEY GUYS WE HAVE 10 MINUTES BEFORE EVERYTHING EXPLODES BUT LET'S WASTE HALF MINUTE IN A DIALOGUE LIKE ""-Who is he? -Ben -THAT Ben? -Yeah :3 - lol :D"" AND THEN DO A HALF MINUTE KISS!!! so they save Sams and YOOOOO ANOTHER HALF MINUTE HUGGING BROTHER <3 and then quit the chip in like 2 seconds... ""I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I AM DOING DRIVING THIS CAR BUT I AM SURE ZOMBIE WILL COME FROM RIGHT THERE AND... HAAAAY THERE YOU ARE QUICK COME IN AND LET'S GET THE FUCK OUTA HERE"" HAPPY EASY END! <3  Addin': Now finally a comparison with the book (wich doesn't really matters but I will add it anyways, so you can ignore it, it's not important, but if you are interested well.. read it, duh):  Characters were aesthetically pretty ok in comparison but Cassie, Cassie was supossed to be a lil girlish cute not a attractive and kinda sexy cute. IDK ABOUT RINGER, THE FACT HE DOESN'T LOOKS KINDA ASIAN CHANGES NOTHING. Still not well developed any of them I repeat, ambient and enviroment was pretty ok in comparison to the book, they changed some scenarios but nothing to complain. Now: THEY SKIPPED THE FIRST FUCKING HALF! WHERE IS THE MOM SUFFERING? WHERE ARE HER INSECURITIES? WHY THE SPACESHIP IS SO CLOSE TO EARTH? HOW THE FUCK DO THEY MADE THE TSUNAMIS THROWING THAT BIG THING IF THEY ARE RIGHT THERE ON THEIR HEADS AWAY FROM THE OCEAN? THE NUCLEAR BOMBS IDEA TALK WITH HER FATHER (wich now doesn't have sense because they are not in the space anymore). WHERE IS THE ANNOYING GUY IN THE CAMP? THE CAMP IS SO BIG! WHERE IS THE LOVE FOR THE RIFLE? WHERE IS THE RIFLE-MAN IN THE CAMP? SHE WASN'T SUPOSSED TO BE ALLOWED TO GET IN THE BUS! SHE DIDN'T HAD SEX WITH EVAN WHAT THE FUCK SONY. NO SHARK COMPARISON (DEEP COMPARISON), NO FIGHT WITH KIDS, NO GREEN SOUND BOMBS, NO MIND READING, NO KILLS WITH THE CHIP ON THE HEAD, NO LITTLE EYE IN THE SKY BUT A FUCKING MOTHERSHIP ON THEIR HEADS, NO DEEP TALK WITH THE FATHER ABOUT COLONIZATION, PROMISE TO SAMS IS DIFFERENT (very different), SHE GOES TO THE STORE AT DAY IN THE MOVIE WICH IS IMPORTANT! THE FLYING THINGS ARE NOT LONG AND GREEN (silencers?), EVAN DOESN'T SHOOT AT CASSIE. TANK IS ALIVE!!!   I CAN CONTINUE BUT THOSE ARE TOO MANY GOSH.

Didn‚Äôt feel like a romance, not much of a build-up, not much of a foundation for the two to fall in love together I guess? Felt more one-sided really, Evan was pining, and Cassidy was just indifferent. I did like the little nicknames the others had in the squad; almost discarding themselves as human beings, and fitting themselves into that archetype of a solider, going by the names on the field. The army introduction was interesting, I was more interested in this side than Cassidy‚Äôs side, I wish there was more screen time focused on flushing this aspect out, and working more towards the reveal, felt rather.. underwhelmed when Zombie figures it out?   And the others; more information on the others would be nice, and the whole using the kids plot needed more of a backing point, More perspective to really hone on this aspect, otherwise, initially, what is the point? You can do all this, but you need kids, human kids to wipe out the rest of humanity?  So yeah 4/10 for me.",0,0,EvieGoesRaWrx3,kmxLybfGNC4,0.2216346153846154,2016-01-25 00:39:08,False,True

WHy are they on planet earth?  there  are references and i know  the audience is suppossed to be on the edge of  their seats  but come on  give some plot                       no backstory no character development  except for the main character  the movie drags on and on and on and on....      the title does not fit well.   now there will probably be a sequel and people will wave  good bye,0,0,Tim Welch,kmxLybfGNC4,0.24455026455026457,2016-02-04 02:45:02,False,True

No I haven't seen it yet but just from the trailer alone there are two things that speak volumes in the first ten seconds. Now I realize that this is only a movie and yes it is not based on a true story but you would think the producer might want to keep things as real as possible.

I get the 5th wave was supposed to be the biggest revealing moment but they could have been a little more creative with the first 4 waves so they could drag it out a little. The movie shouldn't have been so short. I never read the book, but like most movies do, but I was told they skipped some parts or didn't insert what was said in the book in the movie. Not following the book is a sure way for the movie to not come out that great. The guy who played as her lover looked older than her by 6 years (she looked 15-16 to me) and I really couldn't stand the part leading up to the moment where she got shot (that's all I am saying).

2016-11-19T20:31:21,"ALRIGHT, HONEST & POSITIVE REVIEW: I'd give this movie around an 8.3 (lowest) - 8.9 (highest) It was actually really good. While watching it I got goosebumps & even cried during a few scenes. I think the reason most people look down upon this movie is because  1. they probably read the book before the movie. And for almost every case where that happens, people who read the book first tend to hate the movie. (so if you haven't read the book yet, I really do recommend you to give this movie a chance) 2. Yes, some scenes were cliche: mostly scenes of cassie and evin. But what do you expect? most romantic scenes are cliche. 3. Some actors couldnt play their roles well. For example, Cassies father didnt quit fit his role. Her brother too, but you cant blame him considering hes just a kid (probably 8 years old?) 4. Unfortuantely, it does end with a BIT of a cliffhanger.  5. Most people read too many negative reviews before watching the movie & therefore do not enjoy the movie as much. you get me? as in, people follow the crowd. If one person says the movie sucked, everyone will too.  Okay so in conclusion (!!!!) i REALLY do recommend everyone to watch this movie. Do not look at too many reviews before watching it because it WILL effect your views on watching the movie. While me and my siblings were watching it, none of us understood why it got so many reviews. It was great and i definitely would watch it again.

2017-06-24T21:46:46,"SPOILERS AHEAD/ RANT:  As a fan of the book serious the movie got barley a fraction of anything in the book correct. When I read the book, it was gritty; super bloody, very  dark setting and lots of emotion. Almost had a zombie apocalypse vibe to it. When I saw the movie, all I got with a typical teen romance knock off of 'The Host'. The movie was good in terms of cast, not really for Evan tho, but like seriously the movie made me so sad because it was supposed to be a two hour rated r flick about a girl in the apocalypse trying to get her brother back from an alien infested army training kids to exterminate their own race. Some times I just watch the movie thinking about why could have been an awesome and fresh take instead of romance. In the book there was literally only two pages that dealt with romance. The story didn't focus on romance, but Cassie being alone and trying to do whatever it take to find her brother. The movie made it all about the romance, when that was only a small part of it. Plus they took out the BEST scenes of the book. I didn't expect the movie to be 100% like the book but it was only like 45% like the book.  This series was so amazing and it's just sad to see Hollywood cater to romance driven teens who can't appreciate something that doesn't have to fully deal with romance. The same with the hobbit, like yes we loved he romance but did we NEED it?   Idk, I respect everyone's opinions but this movie was a huge opportunity wasted. That being said, the cast was really put together well, but everything else was meh and made to be cliche.",0,0,Novasaige,kmxLybfGNC4,0.07874999999999999,2017-06-24 21:46:46,False,False

I am not sure why Netflix continues to output these terrible scifi movies, maybe it is too fuel American fears of invasion and the need to weaponize suburbia.   Some annoying elements are:  The all-american blonde girl as lead and narrating a dystopian future is completely ridiculous - there's a reason why Morgan Freeman got all the narration jobs, because it's important to the tone of the film, requires craft and a cadence in the narrators voice.  The acting is terrible (just wait till the Goth girl joins the unit). The human interactions are given so little attention yet we are to believe the forced love story, the unfailing love for the brother, the main character's mental toughness.  The plot is awful.
