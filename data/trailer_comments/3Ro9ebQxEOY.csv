2019-07-22T01:10:24,Movie was great!! Never would have thought the cop was the guilty one(well her son)  There were soo many great things about the movie like why have I only seen it now!! Like not being biased but I love South Korean people(not to mention k-pop) BTS!!  Back to the topic it made me realise once again how scary this world is!!  I liked how the fact the father-daughter relationship was explored and how he followed his guilty conscience till the very end! It‚Äôs basically an emotional movie from a parents view like how the cop would do anything to save her son!! ABSOLUTELY CORRUPTED AND WRONG BTW  Also made me realise how fake people can be- like that pretty black girl with gorgeous curls said Margot was not even her friend but as soon she finds out she‚Äôs missing or dead or that her hashtag is suddenly trending. She becomes her best friend all of a sudden! Like SERIOUSLY! So F****** effed up!!  And last thing naive people like the character Margot should not be allowed to use the internet!!

There were a couple of tells. One being that Fish & chips had no profile photo and then also the model profile photo, how dismissive she was on that and accentuated certain things in her tone as if she was trying to cover something up!! Turns out I was right. Him putting her laptop back in the home was overall stupid/pointless. In an attempt to make it seem as if she didn't go missing right away. All he had to do was continue texting the dad, to make him think she's still responding. Check the texts & take the trash out as if everything was normal to buy time without him investigating. No wonder she wanted to keep her low IQ psychopath out of jail, she wasn't much different to him to be honest. I get he was her son but that girl was this guy's daughter. I also wondered if that was the reason she became a detective, to cover up for her son. Well yeah. The other tell for me was her story about how her son went around scamming people, how she covered for him. I then was on to her that she was now doing the same but for a bigger crime. Don't ask me how I know these things, I just do. So to me there were no plot twists and turns like people say. I was quite bored and disappointed in how bad the writing & acting was. The only thing maybe someone could give perspective on is why did she go to the funeral on her own, without the dad? I felt like it was a bit more then attendance to make sure everyone assumed she died, something else was going on. The only thing I couldn't predict is that his daughter would have survived in the end. Regardless of the rain, still didn't know it would mean her survival as she could have gone into shock due to injury or suffer from hypothermia once temperature drops and being out there wet in the cold, or died from injury as in hitting her head. I would go as far to say the detective herself had cold and callous traits. The moment she showed up I sensed she wasn't normal, maybe that's how they told her to act for the scene but I knew and the rest of the movie was like really. That said, major fail imo.
