2015-07-13T05:22:44,"I loved the original ""National lampoons vacation"" from the 80's, certainly a true classic. I do like how at least it's Rusty taking his family to wally world instead of another shit remake of a once classic film, I'll give this a chance before I say anything but I am already skeptical. I swear, it's been like 100 years now that we've been making movies and I'm saddened that so many piece of shit producers already have completely run out of anything new and original to make so they get lazy, take a childhood favorite and end up pissing in the faces of fans everywhere by ruining it for a paycheck. If I see one more full blown remake of a 70's or 80's film that does nothing besides insult the original, I'm going to be sick! I'm no professional writer but do occasionally write a short story here and there and if I can think of something new to write, Hollywood can do so too and I garentee that a shitty new film is still 100X better than seeing the same old idea repackaged for the 21st century only now it's terrible. The bottom line is either stop remaking classic films into shit or just don't make anything at all because having no movie out is still so much better than seeing a classic film insulted. If we don't stop this shit, soon we'll be seeing the day where ""The Godfather "", ""Star Wars"", ""Back to The Future"" and every other truly classic film is ruined by turning it into an awful remake one summer so sony or some other pathetic production company can make a few more million dollars from the idiots who actually watch these disasters in the theater or even worse, buy them on DVD!",1,0,Blunt Man,4cNmMLq9ZrQ,-0.012243253200700018,2015-07-13 05:22:44,True,True
