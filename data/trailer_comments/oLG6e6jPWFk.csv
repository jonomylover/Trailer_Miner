2017-09-20T17:49:03,"The term ""actual event"" is easy to put in any film and actually legal to put in, ANY FILM. Its as simple as putting a name of an actual person or add something that really happened. If the movie has something that in real life is a fact, they can legally add at the biggining of the movie ""Actual events"". ""The Harry Hill Movie"" is a perfect example. At the beggining of this terrible fictional movie they add "" based on a true movie"", wich is the same, and it was legal to add that info because he was actually called Harry Hill, mad but true. Never really belive in what comes up. I highly recomend that if your truly into the happening that goes on in the film that you look it up and discover for yourself.",0,0,Oscar Jackson,oLG6e6jPWFk,0.07841666666666666,2017-09-20 17:49:03,False,False
