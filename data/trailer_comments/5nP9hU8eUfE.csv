Not that an eight year age gap is super crazy, it's just slightly weird, it   It doesn't have much significance, but I'm always curious about the ages of characters in movies and shows, so I thought it might be interesting to know; especially when two characters might potentially end up dating. (The math I used is below if you want proof. Click read more to see it.)  At the beginning of the movie when Judy was a kid you later learn that she was 9, and then after the whole thing where Gideon Grey bullied her it said 15 years later, where the rest of the movie takes place. 9 + 15 = 24. As for Nick's age, you can figure that out when Judy's calculating how much money  Nick has made that he hasn't reported in order to blackmail him with reporting tax evasion. After multiplying the number of dollars  Nick makes per day, which he states is 200, by the amount of days in a year, and taking that product (which is 73,000 by the way,) to multiply it by Nicks age, she gets 1,460,000. So 200 x 365, = 73,000. Then when you divide 1,460,000 by 73000 to figure out the unknown variable, (how long Nick's been a Popsicle hustler,) you get 20. The sum of 12 (he states he started when he was 12) + 20 =32.",48,19,Callista McGee,5nP9hU8eUfE,0.033333333333333326,2016-06-21 20:57:14,False,False

2017-11-27T23:31:28,"Here's something you should know about ""THE FURRY MOVIE"". This movie has been called ""the furry movie"" BECAUSE before it was released Disney made a promotional campaing directed towards the furry comunity.. they even made a hashtag and colaborated with some people that are popular in the furry fandom.. ALL THAT just to make sure the movie would attract more public and of course make more money in the process.. Also I think that the fact of calling zootopia ""the furry movie"" it's some kind of comercial strategy too. SO this movie it's NOT actually a furry movie AND if you saw it and liked it that doesn't make you a furry unless you claim yourself as one. Just an animated movie with animal characters (NOTHING NEW) not so perfect movie nor a bad movie.

2018-01-05T00:38:55,"I am a furry myself and for one thing I am extremely annoyed ppl can't be open minded .... its simple ...   furry definition for idiots === A person who is a fan of Anthromorphic  animals    movies like Madagascar , kung fu panda, Winnie the pooh,narnia,mlp,the lion king,101 Dalmatians, zootopia etc are all movies with Anthromorphic animals. .......   Sooo if your a fan of the characters in those movies then .. that's what makes you a furry .......   because I'll say it again .... a furry is nothing more than a fan of anthromorphic animals .....   some furries like to express their love for Anthromorphic animals by creating their own original characters ... OC's (, just like every other fandom ever)   orrrr they make themselves a fursona ... a fursona is a character that's an animal of some kind  representing the person as a whole.... just like a persona ^-^    some ppl even love bringing that character they made to life ( remembering that this character is very important to them since it represents them as a whole ) they might decide to create a fursuit of the character  ( or buy one. ... better to make one honestly ....)  . Then they might decide to wear that fursuit to things like Furcon!  were they can hang out with other furs , play games and do fursuit parades...   most ppl use fursuits to take some time away from the horrible life norms and hang out with other furs ... a lot of things furries like to do is go around parks and entertain children and adults alike ...    some ppl make toony suits, and some make realistic suits... some use crazy colours . then some use natural colours ... some use both. .  Keep in mind that to ... be a furry ..... you do NOT need a fursuit .....   furries  are also supposed to be the most welcoming community out there ... Furries don't discriminate any sexuality that you are..... if your Gay, homo,demi etc It doesn't matter!!     if you want a nice example of some furries doing something nice .. then check out the video made from faux and toologa on faux's youtube channel.....  Its a furry Hug challenge ....   hugs Are scientifically proven to help reduce stress and stuff like that even if only a little bit ... So the fact two furries  out of their way to do a furry hug challenge .... is awesome! .. not only did they do a challenge .... they basically gave out free hugs!!    now aside from the amazing art and crafts made in the fandom there is ....   another side of the fandom that makes all of us furries get a lot of hate ......    the horrible Sexual side .....  *now you listen here*  Us normal furries try to ignore that side of the fandom the best we can but its difficult .... especially    when ppl automatically assume that everyone in the fandom is like that .....    I could go on but I'll think I'll stop here ... sure We are a little weird no one can Deny that ..... but there is no need to hate on furries just because of a small minority of ppl we have literally NO control over ....",1,1,SharkyCharlotte,5nP9hU8eUfE,0.11861574074074074,2018-01-05 00:38:55,False,False

Or can such a story emerge in ""real"" wildlife? Hardly likely). Or other popular series like Tom and Jerry. So if you like one of these you ARE a kind of furry too. And that's not bad, it's like an hobby. In such a case, I could say too ""EWW Football."" It's an hobby too. Being a furry isn't bad. I like the drawing style and the idea of that it's in my opinion very beautiful. I never was on a Furcon (Which is probably because I am from Germany) and I don't own a suit.

2019-08-27T04:40:26,"Imagine this: you are Officer Hopps, going on your daily run. Suddenly, you get tripped, by a foxy boi just hanging around. The lights go off, and you hear giggling as he retreats. Ugh.. You clap, and the lights come back on. You dont see him anywhere. Hm.. You look up. There he is, hugging the ceiling, and looking down at you. This one is suprisingly quick. Its already revealed its secret legs. Four hairy, bony legs portrude frkm various orepheses, and clingbto the wall, while what used to be the fox faced you below. The body is visably pulled inward and stretched, save for its face, which is permantly stretch in a eriee grin. Its jaw hangs slack, with tiny droplets of blood going drip, drip, drip from it onto the floor. Its eyes are glosy and soulless, but stare into the very escense of your being. Nothin a good ol elephant taser cant fix. Well, if the cross and holy bible doesnt do its job first of course. Suddenly, the thing springs to life, and launches towards you, the bad of meat and skin that was a fox hurtling towards you in an eternal embrace. You easily manuver to the side, and you hear the heavy thump of its body hit the floor behind you. You take off, running away from the thing, and reviewing your options. Within seconds, it is up, and you can her the rake of long, splindly legs scraping and bumping the floor as it approaches. Its hunting scream echoes the corridor as it gains. You have no choice, and whip out the taser. One shot... BAM! It pierces one of the creatures many legs, and it gives a painful bellow and slows down significantly. You can hear its slimy skin slide off of its body, and the blood sloshing from its cavity. You turn around, and whip out your handy cross. OUT DEMON OUT DEMON OUT DEMON you chant, and the thing begins a pained death wail. It comes to a stop, wobbling, as your screams echo its. Eventually, it gives up, and lands on its back, its now muscly and furless spider legs curling up into a fetal position, like a spider. Whats left of the fox was now just clumps of fur, a few tissue, and bone. The face still remainrd tho, its eyes pointed dully at the ceiling. Phew. That was close. If it had the chance, it would fully evolve, and then... You dont want to think about. You walk out of the room. Someone else would take care of the mess.",0,0,Girl Gamer,5nP9hU8eUfE,0.006657088122605364,2019-08-27 04:40:26,False,False

2020-06-06T18:25:28,"This movie is about racism. In this movie Judy becomes a cop and moves to Zootopia and is told by her parents to be aware of predators. She is given many different gadgets to help “protect” herself against these predators and even kinda draws one of those gadgets when she encounters “Nick”. The talk of Zootopia is how animals like the Jaguar, the Fox, the Lion and many other predatory animals are going savage and acting crazy. It seems that every animal in Zootopia is civilized and they criticize Foxes and Jaguars as “a danger to society” in Zootopia",1,0,"Don’t Shoot Me, I’m Poor",5nP9hU8eUfE,0.115625,2020-06-06 18:25:28,False,False
