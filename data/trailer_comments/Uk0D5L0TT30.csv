That's not something to be proud of. That's not even the way a filmmaker should think.  He claims that he makes these films for the children that fall in love with his work. But John buddy children will fall in love with anything mildly successful and they'll move on to the next thing. This isn't like the masterpieces you've made that are everlasting. There's a difference. Worst of all it's a really contradicting ideology when Brad Bird and Andrew Stanton in past seminars and interviews claimed that they never made films just for kids.
