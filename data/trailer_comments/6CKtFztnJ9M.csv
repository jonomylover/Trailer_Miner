That's the problem, its not supposed to be like the originals. Its a new era, things are going to change, so if you complaining saying new stuff sucks, that's just you and others saying it sucks. Hell, you're tricking yourself it sucks JUST BECAUSE IT'S NEW! The only reason this franchise is declining is because of the fans, not just because it ""sucks"". Yes, the newer ones seem very lack-luster in good acting but it is good in some elements. Im not saying the new stuff is good, but if we the fans start encouraging and stop hating on the franchise, hell they might make a really good fucking movie! But then you'll complain that its new and it sucks, but it doesn't suck and you just want to have the originals back. You infect other people with your opinion, and they start thinking it's shit too. So, please. For the franchise, for what you enjoyed as a child, or as a fan that watched it later in their lives, or people that just like it casually. Don't just assume it sucks, IT HASN'T EVEN COME OUT. Please make this top comment, because I hope even just a few other power ranger fans can look at this and at least consider t an option.

I meant, I can't picture new movie of this age looks like the 90s. With the superheroes movie on demand, so it's really good to make this based on superhero theme.

He ended up siding with the good guys after a bit of time, and stayed as the Green Ranger until the candle burned out and the power went away. Zordon and Alphalpha used what they learned from the Green Ranger's power and made the White Ranger. They brought back Tommy as the White Ranger but had to warn him to be careful, as it was much weaker than the Green Ranger that he was used to, but still as strong as 2-3 of the normal Rangers combined. They did this for balancing, as after they showed the Green Ranger's strength he literally could beat all the normal Rangers+Zordon+Alphalpha quite easily. Hence, Saban made the candle burn out thus leading Tommy to become the much-weaker-yet-still-strong-enough-to-be-the-leader White Ranger lol.  There you guys go.

It's SUPPOSED to be over the top and ""bad"" in many aspects. When it's serious, it's fucking serious, but when it isn't, it never tries to be. So watching this trailer, what do i see?  I see 5 misfits in a teen drama being bullied be ebul bullies and a split second of them getting suits at the end of the trailer.  nononono FUCKING NO. you give, at most, 30 seconds to the ""teen"" aspect, then you have shit go down, them become the rangers, and then show off the zords. NO ONE is going to see this movie for teen drama, they want to see *THE FUCKING POWER RANGERS*.

Ever since Marvel have been running the superhero movie franchise with their darker tones, Power Rangers probably had to go with a similar concept just to reach out to a similar audience.

Also for those that complain that it's gonna suck because it's not like the show, this films clearly been made to hit a much larger demographic than just 'Power Rangers Fans', so just wait and see till the movie comes out and actually go into the theater with an unbiased, neutral approach to the film.

You cannot not like tommy when he literally was a good person and good character.I don't remember Kimberly and Jason ever having a thing. Rita rapusla looks like the actually green ranger because of the suits they have now. I wanted the dark tone but making them criminals and the weak people in the school kind of destroys the image them just being really good people wanted to do more good. They could have totally made this movie with the original characters background. Like for a teaser they should have just show Kim doing her gymnastics thing, Trina doing her yoga thing, making Zach the dancer, and Jason the guy really good at karate, while billy was always the smart one. Of course tommy was Jason competition in karate but at the end of the day they were all really good friends.

2016-10-11T11:20:49,You guys kill me. Ok where do I start off first. This is a remake not a reboot. Tommy isn't in this. He's not the original five. Nobody likes him. Zack is now Asian and not black. Billy is now black and not white. Trini is now Hispanic not Asian . Why do they have powers? The power stones were made by aliens. The power coins adapt to them like a host. Whatever power that stones have they now possess. The suits are basically symbiotes. Which is why when Jason was morphing it was just leeching onto him. It's already apart of his body. In the original they were wearing spandex which I loved but it was bull shit. When you are a power ranger you are the ranger ain't no more normal person. You have power.,0,0,bigmaxcc,6CKtFztnJ9M,0.13974358974358972,2016-10-11 11:20:49,True,True

Original power rangers can either be viewed as racist or as empowerment for many people. I never liked  the fact that they would classify them to roles like asian being yellow ranger african american being black ranger and so forth but seriously, we need all the different people even if they are not in the same color suits and the native american red ranger is white Goku from dragonball evolution all over again. I mean if we are doing it let us not half ass the cast halfway through typecasting if you plan on playing the nostalgia card. Also, are they serious with this bullied kids become superhero shit? We have seen spiderman loved it and moved on and watched as so many super 8 and shit throwing this stuff at us which only means this movie instead of focusing on the action enemies and good meat they will instead focus on teenage life with some action and generic villains again I am not a formula and refuse to go see crap the only thing that people will remember about it is the probably 5 minutes at the end where they set up what this movie could have been and promise another. They however will not deliver another because sales wont be the greatest and it will flop like B vs S nostalgia will kick in and a lot will go see it opening weekend and then sales will fall I am calling it now 68% the following weekend.

Even worst, they got rid of the best part of Power Rangers, the theme song. This is worst than the time they used rap instead of rock.

Billy is now black and not white. Trini is now Hispanic not Asian . Why do they have powers? The power stones were made by aliens. The power coins adapt to them like a host. Whatever power that stones have they now possess. The suits are basically symbiotes. Which is why when Jason was morphing it was just leeching onto him. It's already apart of his body. In the original they were wearing spandex which I loved but it was bull shit. When you are a power ranger you are the ranger ain't no more normal person.

2016-10-13T23:51:22,"Ok i'm conflicted. I grew up with the original power rangers all the way and i truly love those rangers because that was my childhood, it brings back great memories for me and i will always be happy watching those old episodes (yes i'm a dork and i have all the mighty morphin seasons on dvd and i'm trying to get the others i watched too lol). And honestly that nostalgic part of me screamed no when i saw the first few seconds of this, it really did. BUT i have to say if this wasn't associated with the power rangers franchise i would be much more interested in seeing this movie because it honestly looks cool. It is gritty looking for a young adult movie, looks like it works well in todays world and it has super powers, you can't really go wrong with that combination lol. It's just the power ranger part that throws me off and makes me feel unsure. And yes i know people get all mad because they think nostalgia clouds judgement and too a point it does and it always will. It's very hard to look at a new version of something you grew up with. It doesn't matter what genre or era you're from it will always be a little hard to separate those feelings but i do think this will be an interesting film and i hope it does well.",0,0,Kate W,6CKtFztnJ9M,0.2103787878787878,2016-10-13 23:51:22,True,True
