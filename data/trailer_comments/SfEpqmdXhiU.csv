Making a Sonic movie into a buddy-cop scenario is also a little confusing and uninspired. Pros: Sonic's got a decent voice and the right kind of attitude, and him having an underground hideaway is a lot like the comics. And the Eggman design at the end of the trailer is really good too.  I think how this movie is gonna be received overall depends on how they portray Sonic and Eggman: if they keep Sonic's personality in check without him getting annoying, it'll be great, and if Eggman ends up as something more than typical Jim Carry comedy, that'll be great too. That and how Sonic came to be in this world of regular people will be important.

The rights were first picked up by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer only for the studio to run into financial trouble and conflicts with Sega. Eventually, MGM lost the rights and the film went into hell, only for Ben Hurst, a head writer for Sonic Sat AM, to negotiate the rights so that he could do a continuation of what was supposed to be the third season. This ran into problems when Ken Penders, then-head writer of the Archie Comics series, tried to intervene and make the movie himself. It was placed in hell once again when Sega decided to place more interest in Sonic X.

Sure, the design may not be the best, but they so far have done a pretty good job with Sonic's personality. Jim Carrey as Dr. Eggman is pretty cool, too. On top of that, the movie seems like it's gonna have a similar plot to that of Sonic X, which I am a HUGE fan of. Sure, the design of Sonic may not look like the ""actual"" Sonic, but if the plot IS like Sonic X, then it would make sense that he looks like this. This also explains the electricity around his fur. He's in another world, which means that there would be different effects from him running so fast. I'm not saying that the movie will be awesome, but I don't think it'll be really all that bad.

2019-04-30T19:22:14,"I'm trying REALLY hard to play Devil's Advocate for this movie. But I refuse to support anything that looks like a Smurfs plot. And this looks like a Smurfs plot. I get that a video game movie sometimes just wants to be it's own thing and doesn't wanna just BE the plot of a video game...like how sometimes they just want to be good movies, like the Resident Evil movie and the Detective Pikachu movie (which I'm CONVINCED is going to be at the VERY LEAST ""pretty good,"" you can tell love was given to making this movie, THEY EVEN GOT RYAN REYNOLDS.)    But this? This just looks lazy. The only CGI is gonna be Sonic and Robotnik's robots, unless they throw in a Tail's cameo at the end. It doesn't look like Sonic is an alien from Mobius in this movie because we can see he's been on Earth for a while. He has a home, a stack of worn out shoes. In fact, Tails would either: not exist, not have met Sonic yet, or not be a child GENIUS, because Tails would normally (in almost every version of Sonic) be smart enough to make shoes that can handle Sonic's speed.    Robotnik isn't skinny. The reason the games started calling him Eggman was because he was super fat. AND IF THE MOVIE DOES SOME SCENE WHERE JIM CARRY BECOMES FAT LIKE EGGMAN MY BLEACH WILL DRINK *ITSELF.*     Why is Sonic teaming up with a human? And not just a human, some cop guy? Sonic NEVER needs the help of humans besides Eggman. Because he can create giant robots. I've seen pretty much every Sonic game. He doesn't team up with some random Joe. Also this movie is clearly gonna play with Sonic's speed inaccurately. He'll get hit by a dart of which would NEVER hit him. But he can also STOP TIME. Okay.    Finally, I don't want any dumbass telling me ""it's a kids movie"" because kids movies aren't immune from criticism. Remember the Last Airbender? How about COOL CAT SAVE THE KIDS?

We could have gone our whole lives without having this come into existence, and the human race would be all the better for it. 2. Even if this did have to happen, this is the exact wrong way to do it! 3. This movie looks way too outdated. This feels like something that would have come out in the late 90-early 2000's. In an age where movies like Coco, Kubo and The Lego Movie are more frequent than ever, I would've thought that kid's movies should start to be held to a higher standard. 4.On top of outdated, this movie  looks very predictable. I bet I can tell you right now how this entire movie is gonna go without even reading the script or watching the movie. 5. Sonic looks so hideous that I'm pretty sure I'm gonna see him in my nightmares.  6. As if to further prove just how outdated this movie is, they chose Gangstah's Paradise of all songs to put in the trailer. It has nothing to do with the character of Sonic and doesn't even match what's being shown to us onscreen.  7. Why are doing the Smurfs/Masters of the Universe story again?! Why can't we have a Sonic movie that takes place entirely on Sonic's homeworld? If Marvel can make a bajillion dollars off of 2 movies that are both set in space and both star a talking racoon and a talking tree, then I think audiences can accept a movie about an entire planet full of anthropomorphic animals with superpowers fighting against a mad scientist who's trying to turn them into robots.  8.

2019-04-30T23:55:10,"Sonic let off an EMP powerful enough to knock out electronics on the entire Pacific Northwest.  According to GoNorthwest, the area has a population of around 15 million. Bump Reveal estimates that 3,978,497 babies are born every year in the United States.  Using statistics from Bliss it is estimated that about 1 in 7 babies in the UK require a neonatal unit upon their birth. Assuming this statistic translates to the United States, this would mean that 568,365 need this treatment in the US yearly.  The United States has approximately 327.2m people living there, meaning that the Pacific Northwest holds approximately 4.5% of the US population, translating to 25,576 babies needing neonatal treatment in the area yearly.  Using Bliss's statistics again, it can be seen that the average stay in the neonatal clinic for a baby is one week. Considering there are 52 weeks in a year, this means that 1/52 of this figure are in the clinics at any one time.  This translates to 491 babies in the area where Sonic the Hedgehog immediately cuts complete power and life support to.

You know there is a problem when the least disturbing aspect of the design is the color of its arms!) to the choice of the song (Gangsta's Paradise is a great song, but it has nothing to do with the Sonic universe!), this first trailer was a total disaster.

At least Jim Carrey really stole the show as ""origin story Robotnik"" and sonic still had solid moments.
