The story line had potential and there was decent acting by Russel, Dern and Jackson as usual but some of the others was sad. Some of the actors in this would completely forget their roll accents in the middle of the sentence. Lousy writing. Like oh yes im sure those cowboys back then had those long ridiculous conversations. The production was the worst. Why does this western have a pop music score? The whole thing in that cabin was completely stupid. Whats with all the above the head lighting when the cabin was lit with candles and oil lamps? In some of the scenes you can actually see light bulbs. Parts of the cabin was lit with super bright (white) light. I didnt know they had electricity back then, never mind in the middle of nowhere, never mind bright white halogen. I know it has the Tarantino style but it just doesnt work in a western.  Personally i look for realism and period accuratcy. I couldnt finish watching this one. My feeling on this movie may be unfair considering im in the middle of re-watching Deadwood.
