2017-07-29T01:06:23,"God created everything perfect and made mankind in his image, then Satan a fallen angel, tempted Adam and Eve the first humans on Earth to disobey God and because of that disobedience they gave birth to the nature of sin and effected the world with sin. We all inherit sin from Adam and commit sin when we do something bad. We are all guilty of sin and fall short to God's glory. Because of our sins we are destined for hell, will have eternal separation from a holy God and will continue to be spiritually dead. But God showed his great love for you by sending his son Jesus Christ to die on the cross to save you from your sins, so if you believe in Jesus as your Lord and savior, you will be destined for heaven, be saved and forgiven of your sins and will be given the Holy Spirit, who will make you spiritually alive. Then Jesus rose from the dead, therefore defeating the powers of death and Satan. Jesus will return and will gather his faithful people into his kingdom on Earth, where true, love, peace and joy dwell that's beyond human comprehension and beyond comparison. God will judge and punish those who have not had faith in Jesus because by not having faith in him they did not allow themselves to receive salvation. I did bad things, I lied, stole, looked at porn, did other terrible things and I still make mistakes but I started to read the Bible and the more I read it, the more my heart and life began to change for the better. Out of the great, love, grace and mercy of God I'm saved from my sins. I'm grateful for everything God's done for me and though the Holy Spirit he has given me, I experience the love and power of God everyday and it's beyond human understanding. God would never forsake or leave you no matter what and would always take care of you. God would comfort you in times of need and would help you in any area of your life. God loves you so much and that love he has for you is overwhelming and is like your the only person in all existence that he loves with all his heart. Have you ever thought about what your purpose is? God would give you a purpose for this life and the life to come. This life is only temporary and goes by fast but the life to come is eternal. If you have questions about God or want me to pray for anything I'm always here for you. Also i have a video called God loves all:message, if your interested.

2017-08-02T04:27:35,"Criticizing males who dislike this movie with emotional insults like ""they must have tiny balls"", is illogical to me. The argument is that if a man dislikes a movie because a woman plays a role, then he is automatically sexist and insecure. What people fail to realize is that it isn't a sense of insecurity or sexism that makes certain men dislike this - it's the fact that it's simply TOO corny.   And people criticizing men in such a manner only lend them strength, as throwing insults towards a large group of people in such a way is inherently disrespectful and will only make them dislike you more.  Not seeing women as a sort of action star figure isn't sexism, and if it is, it isn't wrong. The moment everyone sees everyone as every role is the moment a culture is destroyed, as there is no longer any true substance to any sort of role or character. It's simply ""X person could fit in Y role, therefore you can't criticize it when X is Y, as anything which is X can be anything which is Y, and if you do, you're simply insecure X isn't the person you want.""  Why of course this is natural! And it allows a culture to improve itself through criticism, what we see now is a degradation of culture in the continuing absence of controversy, rather, ""this is a movie. It lacks substance. You cannot criticize ANY of the actors or actresses because its a movie, so obviously, you shouldn't take it seriously."" Well shit. If media can never be criticized, and the herd of sheep that is humanity continues to throw their money at it, it will continue to degrade. Such a shame.  The acceptable form of criticism is becoming a criticism of the presence of traditional cultural values a media has. Nothing is funny anymore, nothing has substance, it's simply slapstick, ""progressive' ideas of culture, which isn't culture, it's an embrace of an appeal to mediocrity and instant appeal.",0,0,Byron Apgar,yIUube1pSC0,-0.0013632872503840225,2017-08-02 04:27:35,False,True

Maybe I just didn't understand it I dunno (I feel like the movies that get the best reviews by critics are the ones that I simply can't relate to for whatever reason whereas the movies that get the worst reviews, I actually like those). I had no idea what was going on the entire time. The plot was nonexistent, the pacing was really slow, the dialogue was sketchy, the acting was stilted, there were too many scenes of the main character smoking & drinking (as if that's the only thing that makes you a badass) and there weren't enough fight scenes (I went into this thinking it was gonna be like a Fast & Furious movie with non-stop action. Boy was I wrong! And since a lot of people are comparing this film to John Wick, it makes me not want to watch John Wick because that film is probably just as bad). I really wanted to like this movie because we need another epic female action flick, plus, Charlize Theron is an amazing actress. But let's face it, Angelina Jolie is like the only female who's actually good at making action flicks (plus, she probably has better screenwriters and directors for her films). Every other actress pales comparison. Anyway, I kinda regret paying to see Atomic Blonde but at the same time ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" was even worse (as was the  ""Carrie"" remake a few years ago and ""Hercules"" with The Rock) so it's not like Atomic Blonde was the worst movie I paid to see (plus, I recently paid to see ""Wish Upon"" which was cheesy but I knew that going in. I purposefully paid to see a cheesy teen horror movie and I'm doing it again with ""Polaroid"" later this month.

Better watch discovery channel. At least there you see the winner being a loser too because that's how reality works on nature. Winners eat Loosers, and Loosers eat Winners. It's the cycle.  Hollywood are not worried about art, wisdom or knowledge. They are just spreading the shit that society is right now on a global level.  Oh Okay, she's a hot heroing? so what?
