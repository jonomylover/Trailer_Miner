Also, did anyone else imagine the little place they were put into -in the start of the book- was small? It made the place seem very small, the way they walked around and they could only see a few doors.  And, when they see all the other people presumably from the other glade, it makes no sense! I mean, there is like a mixture of females and males there, when in the book there was only like 1 boy which was Aris and another group of girls which they do not meet until they venture out into the actual scorch.  It is all so different, it is scary.  Some parts you can see relate to the story, like in the trailer, when Brenda fell I think it relates to when the tower was falling down.¬†  But, I don't think that in the book we see Teresa boarding the ""ship"" with Avia etc.  It does look like a good movie, but hopefully we will see some more trailers soon and it might explain it better.

There was a lot of mystery and confusion. Wih is fine if you know there is a third book that explains everything, but not if you're watching a movie. In a movie, a little mystery is captivating and keeps you watching, too much and it gets too confusing to follow.  The book heavily depended on Thomas's thoughts and interpretations of things, flashbacks and telekenisis. It is very hard, if not impossible, to convey that to a movie without being clich√©.

This one looks like it has an even stronger storyline, and this trailer has set my expectations pretty high.¬† And to everyone saying ""The book is wayyyy better,"" let me ask you. Have you EVER said ""the movie is wayyyy better than the book""? Probably not. Because you can't really compare them. A book and a movie are two very, VERY different things. They are completely different forms of entertainment. You simply cannot include every single detail of a book in a movie. That's why it's called an adaptation, it's clearly the same story but with some changes. What works on a page does not always work well on the screen. The author has said over and over again that he is perfectly fine with the changes, and he's even said that they make more sense.¬† So please, understand that basically all book-to-movie adaptations have changes made to them. You should expect that by now, seriously. Stop expecting them to be the same, and then you won't be disappointed.¬† I have understood for a long time that books and movies simply can't really be compared, you have to go into them realizing that they are two different things.

As¬†an avid reader, I understand why people want the movies to be at least 95% like the books. But also speaking as a film fanatic, I also know movie adaptations are never going to be exactly like the books. But as long as they've kept the general storyline/setting/characters the same, I'm not too fussed (unless they majorly change something). What I'm trying to say is, book readers, don't judge a movie until you've actually seen it (open mind and all that), and film fanatics, know that you may not understand something unless you've read the books, so either do that or research on the stuff you don't understand.",0,0,ObsessedWithEverything,-44_igsZtgU,0.06416666666666669,2015-07-26 18:45:53,True,True
