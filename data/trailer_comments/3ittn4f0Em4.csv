2017-12-16T20:18:17,"What makes this sad is that this had the potential to be a great movie. I mean, the CGI animation for each of characters look impressive, and they look exactly the way how Beatrix Potter had imagined them when I first saw them on the pages of her timeless stories. All of that, totally skewered all by the cringe-worthy juvenile dialogue and the equally terrible nonsensical and idiotic plot. While it may look good upon first sight, these characters just do not have the heart and soul of what Potter's iconic classic characters are. To make a young mischievous bunny boy who snuck into a garden for a quick munch of the tasty vegetables and chased out by mean ol' Gregor, now all of a sudden turned into a wild, cocky, trouble maker who likes to tell stupid jokes. What a truly wasted potential watered-down to the pits of the deep end thanks to the horrible writing and pathetically-bad plot. Trying to break the nature lover girl up with their worst neighbor? How stupid is that? I bet a child could use Beatrix Potter's characters many times better than the brain-dead adults at Sony EVER could. Sony may think this movie is funny to them, but to me, I just think this a great insult to the not only the original creator of these characters, but to folks like me who grew up with these timeless characters! At least The Little Prince movie does a good job and even though they add a new plot centered around a young girl and not just the original story of the Prince and pilot meeting, they make it work by making it a heart-warming tale with charming aspects and so it has the soul and spirit of the original story. Paddington also does a splendid job of modernizing the characters yet stays true to the original story. Peter Rabbit could've been the same. But, from a company that made the Emoji Movie, I certainly shouldn't expect anything better from them.

Not to mention a lot of the complaining comments are from many months before the movie actually came out, and I'll shave my head before I believe any of those people actually saw the movie to see if they were right or not. Because it's a cgi remake of a children's classic, therefore it couldn't possibly be good, right? I'm glad I actually decided to see this movie, because it taught me something- even the worst categories of film can have a shining example of how it can be done right. It's a shame that between hissy fits about people's childhoods and hissy fits about an allergy joke that was later dismissed by the movie itself when the character actually did have an allergic reaction and needed an Epipen¬© and everything, this great movie has no chance to succeed.
