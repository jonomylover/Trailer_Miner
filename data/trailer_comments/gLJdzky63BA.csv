What they fail to realize is, that is what made those movies as great as they are. What I mean by that is, Hollywood has forgotten that special affects are mainly only supposed to be used for what isn't physically possible to do or capture.  So when it's used just for hype, basically flashiness, it takes away the realism and substance.  That entire racing scene from the orig.was real, lol, except for the stunt doubles and due to the realness of it, you could feel it, you felt like you were there, couldn't take your eyes off of it etc. The actors back than had to work with less but involuntarily this brought out the best in them because they had to make up for what they didn't have.

Isn't it weird that all the southern states got to vote within the first 24 states? Could it be she is from Arkansas knowing she would get a delegate lead so then the media could then say it's over? Even though the next bunch of states favor Bernie quite significantly. The media constantly showing the super delegates to shape public perception. How about in Iowa that they won’t release to vote totals because it is believed that Bernie got more votes.

2016-03-17T22:11:17,"To all people complaining about unoriginal movies based off of books or older movies, here's a fun fact: About 90 percent of Disney's animated films are based off of some literary work. It's been a thing for a while, its not a new fad or anything. And if you want a remake to be scene for scene what the original was, go watch the 1998 version of Psycho. Spoiler alert: its not a good film. Shot for shot remakes are a bad idea in general because that is unoriginal on the director's part. That's why remakes/reboots like this can and should make changes so its different enough to stand on its own. Complain all you want, I'm just venting what I think. The 1959 film is one of my favorite movies of all time, and because of that I'm excited for this remake. You're entitled to your own opinions, but you really shouldn't judge a movie based on its premise or trailer because they can only show so much of what the movie has to offer.

The reasons being the eleven Oscar awards American Epic historical drama movie ""Ben-Hur"" (1959,) directed by William Wyler and produced by Sam Zimabalist with super star casting Charlton Heston, Stephan Boyd, Jack Hawkins, Hya Harareet, Martha Scot,  Hugh Griffith & so on is still occupies a special place in the hearts of millions of fans due to superb photography, best acting, costumes and location scenes & marvellous sets. The scenes of boat, Chariot race & emotional scene i.e. meeting of Judah with his mother & sister infected with leprosy touched the bottom of hearts. Really a greatest film ever made and take us to the unmaterialistic world. Regret to mention that, the remakes of those classic movies by Hollywood Directors are doing unjustified to those original movies and also disgraced millions of fans of that era. Rather, they should make movies as per the interest of current generations.
