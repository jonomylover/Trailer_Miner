I refuse to get excited by this but I am due to it being the magical world. This trailer is just not doing it for me.

That way we could see the dual that killed his sister, the relationship between him and Grindalwald a bit more about the history of both of them planning to 'fix' the wizarding world. Yes I know they could still touch on some of these things but they won't be able to do it justice at risk of overshadowing Newt, the protagonist. Plus they probably won't show much of Dumbledore's past anyway as it paint Dumbledore in a bad light. Because, you know, Dumbledore used to be on-board and a big part of what Grindalwald is trying to do in this film.

This movie has all the qualities to be a BLOCKBUSTER and I now know for sure that the good old folks along with the Goddess of Magic herself knows what she's doing expanding the Wizarding World.

The Ridicules-Scene belongs to Lupin and to Lupin alone, Dumbledore always dressed eccentric and not with a fucking suit and Credence died in the first movie, that was the sad beauty of it and made it a good ending, and after all we know it only would make sense that Dumbledore only sees Ariana in the mirror Nergeheb and not Grindelwald even though he loved him - has Rowling written all of this? Or is this a remarkable way of how Studios manipulate movies by insisting on doing over and over again what once worked and what they think the masses will like just like it seems they did with The Hobbit and the new Starwars movies?! Bring back authenticity and real magic, the Beauty, Romance and Epicness of one of the best Worlds ever created.

2018-07-21T21:38:11,Well this trailer looks nothing short of Amazing. The more i see of Depp in the role as Grindelwald the more exited i get. He really is a great casting for a villain. the few bits we've seen so far does sort of remind me of him in Black Mass. There is something evil about him. I think he'll be a perfect fit as long as he can survive long enought to complete this series of movies. I at the very least hope he actually does put some effort into this unlike the last Pirates film where he clearly was only there to get the damn pay check and go home. But it does seem like he is trying a bit more. Hope he can start getting back on that horese again. Johnny Depp is a great actor. An Oscar worthy on infact. But the problem is that he has let himself get typecast way to much for years now. And with him having been deep dwon that dark hole many of us find trough life he hasn't been doing his best job. So i really hope he does what he does best in this film and act! I have faith tough.,0,0,Monkey Powerkey,vvFybpmyB9E,0.20121863799283157,2018-07-21 21:38:11,True,True

He created the register of werewolves in 1947 and the Prohibition of the Experimental Reproduction in 1965. He later worked for the Agency for the Study and Care of Dragons which made him travel to many places and helped him recollect information from creatures all around the world, and with that information he wrote the book called Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

2018-07-22T19:36:15,"The trailers are now a days spoilers; Tis‚Äô true that fan beasts is no potter. But neither is its worthy successor. Believe me animal planet gives it better.  You can‚Äôt live off cgi and vfx and wafer thin plot. And I am not speaking out of blue. Remember breaking bad? It‚Äôs worthy prequel was better call Saul. The more I see this, the more I am disappointed. A bit of plot and bit of directing needs to be changed(thank god the contract with Yates is not permanent). the plot needs to be full of surprises, turns and twists, which is better for an audience of the 3rd decade of 21st century, not the last decade of 20th century. Directing, if has to be based off the potter movies, it must be inspired not ripped off. There is a difference between the movies and its Disneyland mockups. The prisoner of Azkaban here was a nice try, but was at best can be said an authorized ripoff. You are forgetting that times were different back then, so must be the methods and the settings to supplement it. These movies are just more flashy. My biggest nightmares were to leave the potter universe with distaste and indifference. If the Collision Course here is maintained, I am afraid that it might be true sooner than later.  Afterall, there is no dirty of money/resources to make a better movie. We the loyal fans have the good habit of waiting. You may not dole out a movie every year. But when you do, make it really worth the wait. Or if some stats dept. officer is showing you a profit in some economics graph, and thus the results. Then I am afraid it‚Äôs going to be a disgraceful adieu. First, by me(yes the potterheads will roast me), but surely ‚Äòyours‚Äô too.

2018-07-23T18:05:06,"Wow! While I am not a huge harry potter fan. I did see the OG movies; they kept getting better. Hats off, I enjoyed em. Thanks to this trailer I do now. If Johnny Depp turns in something new, the rest of the cast is looks brilliant and the Universe of Harry Potter is one of cinema's best.   When I say I'm not a fan, it is out of respect to fans. As I have not read the books. I did not see the original Fantastic Beasts film. I will now--this trailer has me sold on the film and now the series. No need for more trailers.   A fresh adventure with a great lead and a young Dumbledore well cast. (Depp can shine--also he rarely plays villains, let alone fantastical ones. As for his personal life, I don't care when it comes to film. One MUST learn to separate the art from the artist. Charles Dickens was a cruel man who was downing laudanum (oxy with booze for his Gout.) I still enjoy his books. Except for Bleak House. More like Bleak Brain.  He should be punished for any harm he has caused anyone. If it is just financial I'm sure he'll be fine. I cannot make decisions on which movies I'm going to go see based on the actions of everyone in the cast past or present. There are many, many GOOD people working to bring this film to life so I take art as it is presented and if an actor does their job you should be able to detach yourself.   While the world's love affair with ""Johnny Depp"" the man, may be over, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter appears to be in fine form and on the rise.  A 1st rate series of films that offer an alternative to all the comic book and remake fair we see.   I also see that J.K. Rowling herself is writing the script. That's intriguing. Obviously David Yates knows this world and directed my 2nd favorite Harry Potter film (6). My favorite would be (3) but again, I'm just a casual movie going fan.",0,0,Disco Tex,vvFybpmyB9E,0.23424242424242422,2018-07-23 18:05:06,True,True

2018-07-25T07:34:00,"Not feeling this at all. Just looks like Rowling is stretching out the Potter concept too much... Harry Potter was a fantastic series full of wonder and charm. Everything that made the series work has been taken out of the Fantastic Beasts concept...  Things like its quirky ""Britishness"";  - the audience following of three young children growing into adults; - the audiences own memories of school reflected through Hogwarts;  - the quirky collection of teachers played by various English celebs; - the foreboding and darkness that surrounded the Voldemort legend in the first 4 films; - the transformation from foreboding into a very real threat with Voldemorts return from the 4th film onwards; - the increasingly dark nature of each film as the series progressed; - Ralph Fiennes as Volddmort. - Quidditch. Remove these things and you remove the essence of what made HP special in the first place.  The only thing remotely interesting in FB is Eddie Redmayne as Newt. That's it. Everything else seems to be pale reflection of the original series.

2018-07-29T15:37:41,"I have a theory how Leta Lestrange could be a magical creature, but it's mostly speculation.  From the events of the last film, we know that Newt still has some kind of feelings for Leta, who was the same person that got him expelled from Hogwarts. And by feelings, I mean 'love'. However, in this trailer Leta says, ""You are too good, Newt. You never met a monster you couldn't love."" Considering the fact that Newt still loves her, since he had a picture of her with him when he was in New York, I have two questions. Now, is she in a way referring to herself? And the bigger question: Is she a monster (magical beast)?  There's just another hint to my theory, though. In the shot where Leta is dancing at 1:53, some strange white wisps can be seen levitating in the room circling her. This could a magical enchantment too, but what if it's just a side effect of her 'true' being?  Think about it: Why would a Slytherin (Leta Lestrange) completely open up to a Hufflepuff (Newt Scamander) who just happens to love magical creatures? Well, unless said Slytherin is a beast or at least possesses a dangerous beast. (*cough* Jarvey *cough*)",0,0,musfia begum,vvFybpmyB9E,0.2169938016528926,2018-07-29 15:37:41,True,True

2018-08-04T05:51:19,"I'd be surprised and find it odd if Tom Riddle doesn't show up before this series is over, and I think we will see that there was interaction between he and Grindelwald. Grindelwald is still nearing the height of his power and influence circa 1943, at which time Tom is 16 and already, in terms of skill, intellect and prowess if not yet global reputation, a master sorcerer, and is already in the process of horcrux creation (and just where and from whom did the talented Mr. Riddle learn horcrux making?? Even Slughorn didn't know the exact details, and all indicators are it was some of the most advanced and complex evil magic in the entire storyverse ). Beyond that, Tom is about 19 or close to it before Grindelwald is defeated and captured. 19 is a young man in pretty much every society, and the ""wizarding world"" confers full adult status at 17. Certainly, by the time of Grindelwald's capture, Riddle had already been operating as an extraordinarily efficient warlock, and getting everywhere he desired to go ( especially during vacation seasons ) for several years. Tom Riddle was the actual chosen ""champion"" of warlock-witch dominion that Grindelwald was REALLY looking for (Credence being more of a forerunner and anticipation of Riddle), and I think he will realize that before the series ends. With that in mind, and especially considering Tom's precociousness and brilliance, Tom's youth would have done nothing to deter Grindelwald from trying to form a mutually beneficial rapport with him. We've already seen Grindelwald mentoring and outright seducing a teenish Creedence Barebone, and Creedence was much less mentally advanced and massively less resourceful/capable than teenaged Tom Riddle, who by 16 was already murdering people, framing  and powerfully confounding an uncle, and masterfully manipulating seasoned and formidable professors like Horace Slughorn.  I think it is almost inevitable that some aristocratic high-school aged lackey of the mid-adolescent Riddle would have made it known to certain connected pure-blood parents/relations that they were in the inner circle of the heir of Slytherin; those relations would almost certainly have treated Tom like some manner of chosen one and come under his sway, and introductions to Gellert Grindelwald, whom they surely would have been secret supporters of, would then also have been inevitable. I don't think it is any mistake that the director of the final Potter films and the first Beast films had Grindelwald refer to Voldemort as ""Tom"" in their brief scene together in Hallows 1. The only people who called Tom by his birth name were people who knew him, and who were in a position of authority over him, before he took the Voldemort alias.",163,20,Gibran Lewis,vvFybpmyB9E,0.13157596371882088,2018-08-04 05:51:19,True,True

2018-09-19T08:00:41,"Is it just me who is annoyed the way newt scamander holds and leans his head in many of his scenes? I didn't watch him in other roles as I recall, so I don't know if he does the same in other movies too but as if he holds and leans his head towards his shoulder while bending, lowering his head a bit . His head's position annoys me. It really is irritating. He doesn't hold his head straight like everyone else. Just watch his scenes in the movie carefully. You will understand what I'm saying.  For most obvious example, just look at the picture of this video just before you click it: /watch?v=eh9QbjqbK4E  That look, that position of the head. While watching the video link, I've given you above, look at the scenes I'm talking about below.  In the video it is 0:27,  You don't have to burst your chin to your upper body 0:31 in this scene; this is exaggerated. (0:31 doesn't bother me that much though). It's just when countless of his head moves in the movie happens to be like in 0:27, scenes like 0:31 cut a swathe. Also in the video it is 0:33, when he gives a look while holding a blue beast. Look at his head, just look. It's not straight. 0:43, can't he just look down while holding his head straightly? I mean why doesn't he just bow down his fucking head towards the table in a straight way instead of bowing his head towards his right side? Does it have to be that way throughout the whole movie? 0:51, just why? Why disappear your neck and merge your head with your body and create wrinkles on your face when you have the chance to hold your head straight and do whatever you are told to with that creature while the camera is filming you from your left side angle? 01:08 again, look behind, closely and carefully just look at him. For example, watch the scene from the movie where he tries to catch Kowalski with his wand and gives up just after kowalski hit him with the suitcase outside the bank.

So much you could go into with grindelwald and dumbledore. So much more epic and creative magic you could show other than just bright lights. Like no one gives a shit about newt who the fuck even is this nobody... wow hes some author from a book mentioned once in the harry potter series and now hes some hero no one ever mentioned. cool great writing. Nearly as stupid as the idea of voldemort having a daughter which the very idea makes no sense and completely contradicts voldemort's self serving character for a forced plot money grab.  Most importantly they only get one shot at the dumbledore vs grindelwald duel and I can guarantee that it will be sad and underwhelming... somehow even more so than the dumbledore vs voldemort at the ministry,0,1,ez lyfe,vvFybpmyB9E,0.16100000000000006,2018-11-13 15:51:47,False,True

Maybe I liked it because it had that first Harry Potter feel to it. It was almost like a alternative version of the first. It had more of a adult feel to it.  I like hearing and learning more about the teachers and history and not so much the kid point of view.  Don't get me wrong... I can sit and enjoy any Potter film. I'm surprised I like them.
