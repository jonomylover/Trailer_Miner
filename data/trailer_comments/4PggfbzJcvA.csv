I am a personally no user of liquor or marijuana and I can clearly see the agenda being pushed from the liquor industry, as Halle Berry tells Channing Tatum - ""From now on, I suggest you stick with booze.""   I feel like the first movie was a lot purer from every angle than the second and just because it got a lot of admirations, I think some capital forces decided to join in on the party and sell their ideas of ""what's right and wrong"" by sponsoring the movie and having ""the lovely cast"" do some propaganda on their behalf, which I find disgusting.    The more I observe, the more I am convinced how Hollywood is just trying to push agendas from people with money and I am not talking about a simple product placement of cars, watches and etc. I am talking about some serious social issues that affect many and it seems that Hollywood's agenda is to continue to brainwash ""the zombies"" with lobbyist's propaganda.
