First off, this guy's boat would've been spotted and pulled without permit. There are only several reliable spots to cage dive with great whites and they are heavily protected. Guadalupe island for example only hands out 11 licenses each season. The odds of seeing a great white randomly in an unreliable area, even with significant chum, are extremely small. Companies hang out in same areas too so a random boat would be spotted so fast it'd be silly. Second, when u cage dive real life each cage is double steel lined (each can hold a bus by itself), then u have a master diver with you (only time do not require one is if you are in a surface cage), then there are additional air tanks as well in case of emergency. They are setup in such a way that if both lines somehow did snap u just turn a valve and they fill up two containers which floats cage to surface. Finally, great whites are 100% not attracted to us, they could care less. These two girls (even with boat most likely long gone) could easily swim to surface and head inland. Great whites constantly move around. PS - One air tank would not have lasted that long till night time, not even close, and their ears would have been totally screwed up from a fall that quick bc of pressure change.

But there's also the factor of their air tanks!!  -It is unknown how much air they used before the accident. but with the pressure compressing the air and their heavy breathing and screaming, it's safe to say they depleted it pretty quickly, so their chances of surviving are slim at best.   so overall, judging by its trailer, this movie looks very poorly written. these characters seem so uninteresting, the story just isn't there, and I only imagine the ungodly amounts of filler to make this movie stretch to an hour and a half.  and that's my two cents.",15,8,Bree Holthus,ddYSGGJAKOk,0.19043956043956042,2017-05-31 01:26:33,True,True

Sharks are going extinct because people eat them for food, and because they're afraid of them. Sharks are actually very curious, intelligent creatures. *They're water puppies.* The more sharks are killed, the higher the seal population. These means that fish, the food source for seals, will go down as well, ruining business for many people, and many people in foreign countries will starve, as seafood is their main source of nutrition.   It is Jaws, and movies like this one that shouldn't be encouraged.

A full face mask with no nose clamp, that allows them to equalize and not blow out their eardrums at a rate of decent exceeding 300 feet per minute? I must have it! And, they're diving with what looks like Aluminum 50s, and have enough air to stay at about 150 ft. for over an hour! Even using two tanks, that's incredible! And, changing your first stage underwater, that's a capability I would like to have! But why didn't they send them tanks with regulators already attached? And how to they not get narc'd beyond belief until the second tank magically had an effect similar acid and shrooms, washed down with absinthe? I won't even bother talking about what happens in the hallucination, and the ruptured lungs that would have killed them all instantly... And those ""Deep Sea Divers"" from the coastguard diving singles? WOW!!!

Cable breaks and divers rocket down to 47m in less than a minute, they eardrums rupture form the sudden uncontrolled descent and inability to valsalva that fast. The inexperienced divers are struck with the vertigo induced from the water rushing into their perforated ears, with the panic of suddenly being dropped so deep and the buzz of narcosis, its not unlikely they'd puke in their mask. If they can't figure out how to clear the puke from their mask in their disoriented state they drown in their vomit, if they do, or don't puke in the first place their single 80 tank of air at 47m (unless your calm as zen and a cardio hero) will last roughly 20 minutes of breathing (not a very long movie), they also have depending on your tables roughly 5-10 minutes window where they can ascend without decompression. The ascent can't be too fast without risking arterial gas embolism (AGE) though and without fins you'd need some air in the BC to get up, especially from so deep, if they lose control of their ascent rate they'll be rocketing up risking AGE.

Kate does everything she can to try and make contact with the people back on the ship and and swims out of the cage and what not, while Lisa is all relaxing in the damn cage for a good chunk of the movie. And then she gets her leg stuck so kate once again has to do everything her self. Their both running out of oxygen so KATE grabs the new air tanks that the boat crew sent down. Then once grabbing it she gets her self killed by getting eaten by a shark. And then Lisa thinks she is dead so then she actually tries to do something and she gets her leg out and hears kate and she thinks she still alive. She find kate and they both ascend up after doing the decompression. And then later we find out it was all a fucking hallucination. Kate stayed dead, Lisa still stuck under water, she is going all drunk, and then the coast guard comes and save Lisa. END OF MOVIE.
