2014-08-24T21:32:36," You need to get your labels on right. The dominatrix is not the goddess. That said, Only 144,000 are allowed to know her,  the goddess, the ""twin sister"" of Jesus - she was not made flesh, apparently. (Comic books, are fascinating - morality plays.) Wisdom, is a goddess : see, Prov. 8, kjv. And you would not look upon your Mother as a Goddess, but your wife only. It is why many do not believe that many will go to heaven, for they have blasphemed against Our Mother, which is the mother of Jesus. Mary upon the earth was the feminine side of God, ""incarnate"", in the flesh. She called God, her husband, her Saviour. Our Saviour is the Lord Jesus Christ. The Word WAS God, (God is a spirit), and the Word was made flesh. You do not call man, God - Jesus was made lower than the angels for the suffering of the Cross, and by inheritance is above them. (Be neither a Catholic, nor a Protestant.)   The Church is the Body of Christ. [Mary, the mother of Jesus, is the Handmaiden of the LORD, and the Wife of God : She has no ""earth parents"" but is like the priest Melchisedek  created without biological ""earth"" parents.   Holy Mary is the feminine side of God. Being the Spirit of Grace, much was hid from  Her, as was hid from John the Baptist (who did not know he was Elijah, the second  coming). All things are possible with God. Much is hid from many.] A Goddess is like the character HitGirl from the movie, KickAss : ""Don't worry. I'm on your side"". In contrast, the Dominatrix only cares about herself, and sees the man as a resource, to be used (for carnal, fleshly, earthly purposes), like a disposable commodity. It is why the laws are the way they are, anti-male, pro-sodomite, pro-feminazi, etc. It is why boyscout organizations, men's only business clubs, veterans halls, and sports organizations have been made co-ed, or illegal. Meanwhile, hospitals, schools, outdoor clubs, etc. have been created which are ""female only"". They say ""women and children's rights"" to let boys know tbey might as well kill themselves then be men, seeing men have no rights, only responsibilities. The world is as it has always been - hateful towards Judaism, which is the source of light for them who lie in darkness. Truth is a light. The Word of God is Light. After the Fall, the LORD  said to the woman that her desire would be to her husband, and he would rule over her. So, who did she desire to be her husband? There were at least two ""obvious"" (visible) choices : the man, or the  serpent. Whom did she choose? Pole-dancers are interesting. They remind me of how Moses made a brass serpent and held it up high. And they who looked upon it, were healed. In this movie, Nancy Callaghan is obviously, the Goddess. And who is called, the Goddess, is the Dominatrix. Labels, can be deceiving. How Jewish are you? Many who call themselves Jews, or Christians, are satanists.     Unless you receive the Spirit of Truth, how will you know these things? Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. God is a spirit, and is in Christ. Wherefore the name of the LORD is in Him. Jesus Christ is Lord. See, Romans 10:13, kjv.   The Exodus is here.

Do not males group themselves into team, desiring neither TRUTH nor JUSTICE, but expressing only a desire to ""win""?  And so, it is a game called ""Catholic versus Protestant"" or ""Black versus White"" or ""I'm a mormon, are you?""... They desire not His Words.  Nor do they believe in LOVE. But this will they believe :  Neo-nazism, or eugenics, a belief that genetics determine who is ""godly"" and who is not... Jesus spoke of a parable about a man named Lazarus who looked up at Abraham from hell, and asked Abraham to send somebody to warn his brothers that hell does indeed exist.  But Abraham said to Lazarus that his brothers have Moses to hear, and if they hear not Moses, then neither will they hear if one rose from the dead to speak to them. And so, one can logically conclude that if somebody does not desire to hear the Law of Moses, then that somebody cannot possibly be a Christian... Now many will hear that which is NOT the Law of Moses, but will accept falsehoods as truth... They are satisfied with ""thou shalt not covet"" and never bother to seek His Words, and the Law says, Thou shalt not covet any thing that is thy neighbour's... And hearing this, they do not ask, what is a neighbour?... They desire not his words.  They desire only to belong to teams, and say, ""I go with Pastor Gary..."" ...
