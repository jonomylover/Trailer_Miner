The investigation found that Knight and several others deserted the  Confederate army and returned to their homes in Jones County,  Mississippi. Hiding out in the Leaf River swamps, Knight and his men  made raids, especially on trains. While Knight and his men attempted to  join with Union forces they were unable to do so because both yankee and  rebel viewed the deserters as an enemy. At no time was there any  attempt to separate Jones County from the rest of the state of  Mississippi or the Confederacy.  The term ""Free State Of Jones"" originated during the early 1830s. It was because so many people in the county had moved to other parts of the state that Jones county became almost depopulated.  Also, the majority of Jones Countians supported the Confederacy, even if they had initially opposed secession. Beware of what Hollywood tells you is a true story in history.

Not wanting the truth to be told is proof of why America continues to fail.   However, many so called Americans will never want other Americans to be equal,  have the same opportunity because let's be frank, ""Power, Economic Status, and Skin Complexion"" are the three major points that rule the world. How can some of you just ignore the hypocrisy that shadows are United States of America? So Black People in America just made Slavery all up and because it wasn't the White Americans today who caused slavery, surely, White America today benefits from the exploitation of Blacks.   ""Really"" I say to many of you! There is no such thing as Reverse Racism. How can Black American People be continuously be made Scapegoats for such movies as ""Free State of Jones"" when the Police and the Law exist only because Blacks are targeted and therefore, ""Profitable"" for the Justice System? What about equal schools, better health care, better living conditions, and most of all....REPARATIONS for the torture inflicted. Yes, I said it...because other ethnic groups such as the Jews benefit from the Holocaust. Oh, I forgot, Blacks don't deserve such because in the eyes of America, we are considered, ""Second Class Citizens, Thugs, Sub Human, Neanderthals, Criminals, Low Life's, and Lazy!""  Who built America from ground up.....who helped maintain America in every conflict and war, and who continues to help advance America?  Didn't Black Americans defeat Hitler at the 01936 Olypmics...Jesse Owens......Who invented Peanut Butter...Who invented the First Heart Transplant Operation that saves SCORES every year......apologies, Blacks aren't better than Whites and get treated worse than household Pet's....by the way, Dogs are treated better than Blacks in America.    In summation, how racism is alive and we can be proven it when a Black Man walks down a all white suburban neighborhood, or when a Black Man applies for a job on Wall Street, or a Black Man wants to become a Golf Club Member.....I ask this question to all of my White Americans who blame Black Americans for the issues in our country.......

He lived with an ex-slave named Rachel, fathering several children with her (but he never divorced his Caucasian wife, Serena), and worked on behalf of U.S. Grant‚Äôs Republican administration and against the nascent Ku Klux Klan, and envisioned a world that would only begin to be implemented a century later.""

He warned of textbooks designed to give Southerners a proper education in Northern traditions and at the same time label the Southern cause as evil or unrighteous.

It is true he was a disgruntled soldier, coming to believe the wealthy caused all his suffering (right from Marx's manifesto) and his personal loses in combat made him desert because he didn't want to die. He deserted and fled back to MS and along the way picked up others who were in the same boat. He figured the more the merrier, and strength in numbers. He was destitute, an uneducated man, and opposed authority because he believed the rich always tried to kill the poor. It has been said that it was the freed slaves who organized the ""state"" and he only got credit because he was white.   If this would have been a group of CSA soldiers deserting with no one else involved, we would never ever hear about it. Union soldiers deserted and were hunted, even defecting to the south or Canada creating enclaves yet we hear nothing about them.
