2018-05-04T03:50:35,"None need to be ignorant unless they choose to be thus. Knowledge is to be constantly acquired; it is the food for the mind. With us who look for Christ's coming should be the resolve that we will not live this life constantly on the losing side of the question but in understanding in spiritual attainments. Be men of God, on the gaining side. 1MCP 105.1 Knowledge is within the reach of all who desire it. God designs that the mind shall become strong, thinking deeper, fuller, clearer. Walk with God as did Enoch; make God your Counselor and you cannot but make improvement.‚ÄîLetter 26d, 1887 1MCP 105.2 Take Hold of God and Move Forward‚ÄîGod has given man intellect, and endowed him with capacities for improvement. Then let there be a strong taking hold upon God, a putting away of frivolity, amusement, and all uncleanness. Overcome all defects of character. 1MCP 105.3 Although there is a natural tendency to pursue a downward course, there is a power that will be brought to combine with man's earnest effort. His willpower will have a counteracting tendency. If he will combine with this divine help, he may resist the voice of the tempter. But Satan's temptations harmonize with his defective, sinful tendencies, and urge him to sin. All he has to do is to follow the leader Jesus Christ who will tell him just what to do. God beckons to you from His throne in heaven, presenting to you a crown of immortal glory, and bids you to fight the good fight of faith and run the race with patience. Trust in God every moment. He is faithful that leadeth forward.‚ÄîLetter 26d, 1887 1MCP 105.4 God's High Ideal for His Children‚ÄîHigher than the highest human thought can reach is God's ideal for His children. Godliness‚Äîgodlikeness‚Äîis the goal to be reached. Before the student there is opened a path of continual progress. He has an object to achieve, a standard to attain, that includes everything good, and pure, and noble. He will advance as fast and as far as possible in every branch of true knowledge. But his efforts will be directed to objects as much higher than mere selfish and temporal interests as the heavens are higher than the earth.‚ÄîEducation, 18, 19 (1903). 1MCP 105.5 https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/77.546 https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/77.546",0,0,Brother Nest√≥r; Am√©n,tJfDBSWYqU8,0.21761544011544007,2018-05-04 03:50:35,True,True

Antinomianism takes a biblical teaching to an unbiblical conclusion.The unbiblical conclusion is that there is no moral law God expects Christians to obey.)

If you want to make a fantasy movie, then make a fantasy movie, if you want to make a Robin Hood movie, make a Robin Hood movie and if you want to make a fantasy take on Robin Hood, then I think you need to go back to the drawing board and consider more carefully about how you mix fantasy with Robin Hood. This is not a mix of Robin Hood and fantasy, it's Robin Hood with most Robin Hood removed and replaced with a mess.

2018-05-04T19:56:31,"Guys... have you noticed how wicked and dire the world is becoming as of late?  Take a moment and consider the state of our world:   -The Middle East is at the tipping point.   -The world hates Israel.   -There is a growing demand for a one world economic, political, and religious system.   -There are wars and rumors of war (especially in regards to World War 3).   -Racism is some of the worst it's ever been.   -Hatred and madness is spilling over into riots in the streets.   -Perversion is running rampant.   -The weather is out of control.   -We're mutilating unborn children and mistakenly believing we have a ""right"" to do so.   -Education is in the toilet.   -Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are happening in more and more diverse places at a highly alarming rate.  ... You getting the picture? Something is deeply wrong with our world.  None of what you see going on in the world is normal or good. In fact, much of what you see happening around the globe coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says many of these things would occur before Christ returns. You can investigate it for yourself. The Bible says in the last days there will be: wars and rumors of war; a one world economic/governmental/religious system; Kingdoms against kingdoms and the seas and people raging; Violence and perversion on a grand scale; Earthquakes in diverse places, etc.  ... Sounds *exactly* like our world today, doesn't it? If that weren't enough to chew on, consider this: The Books of John and Acts combined total up to over 120+ historically verified facts. When you consider that, it gets a little difficult to write the Bible off as fairy tales when history and archaeology are on its side...  *Are you paying attention yet?* God is *screaming* at us! He warned us thousands of years in advance that all of what you are seeing would happen- and it is! It's all coming together to the letter! In fact, if you doubt the validity of Bible Prophecy, I encourage you to consider this: the Bible warns that in the last days that Damascus will become ""a ruinous heap."" It will become a no man's land inhabited by no one. Use that as a litmus test of sorts. Keep an eye on Damascus. If it never falls then feel free to throw out the Bible. But when Damascus does fall in the not too distant future... You'll see God is no liar. God also declares that the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus as your Savior. Good deeds won't get you there nor do good deeds erase a bad deed. If you murder somebody, that person is still dead even if you do nothing but good deeds after murdering them. You need a Savior who will forgive you of that murder because you can't save yourself.  Yet, many people will still discount God and His goodness even when shown evidence that the Bible is valid and coming true. A lot of people have difficulty believing in God because of all the evils in the world. However, this discounting of the only Person who can save you may be less of an inborn frustration or complaint and more of a hidden longing, placed there by the very One who planted His own image into the body and soul of every person He created. Where does this deep-seated intuition that suffering and pain are not right come from if we're just amalgamations of atoms, as the atheists say‚Ä¶?  What if, perhaps, this intuition points to something deeper? Something built into ourselves that reflects our true nature and identity? What if this revulsion against suffering and pain is a reminder of paradise, on one hand, and an anticipation of New Jerusalem on the other?  Perhaps it's the cry of the human spirit for God. For our Creator. The only One who can, and will, fix this mess.  As I've said, time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, ""You're just being paranoid like all the other fundamentalists. Haven't we always had these types of problems?"" Sure... But never at this magnitude or frequency! Check the news for yourselves. The amount of earthquakes, bloodshed, madness and horrific weather events are off the charts! Don't be deceived into thinking it's not as bad as it seems out there. The devil wants you to stay anemic and apathetic. Don't let that jerk deceive you. Or win your soul. Satan wants nothing more than for you to roll your eyes, scoff under your breath and put this whole ""God"" business under the rug. He wants you to continue believing that Hell and God and the afterlife is nonsense. That the Bible is all fairy tale nonsense of Jesus riding dinosaurs; that it's stuff only the weak-minded, brainwashed people believe. He'll gladly coax your pride, making you believe you're far too ""reasoned"" to believe in such things. However, Satan believes the Bible. Every jot and word of it. He doesn't see it as fairy-tale nonsense since it details his coming destruction. He just doesn't want YOU to believe it so he can drag your soul down with him when it's time for him to go!  Don't let him drag you down into the grave with him. Don't be played! Hell is a very real place-- a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. A-L-O-N-E. In the dark. Miserable for all eternity. If hell wasn't real, what on earth was Jesus willing to die for to protect us from...? Bill Nye thinks hell won't be so bad; he claims he's willing to hold onto his darwinian beliefs even if it means he's hellbound for it. I hope you won't share in that kind of disillusioned thinking...  Before you're sent to hell, you'll appear at the Great White Throne Judgment. Whether you believe in hell or not makes no difference--that giant throne you want to avoid seeing at all costs will be your destiny if Christ isn't your Savior. At the Great White Throne Judgment the books are thrown wide open and the past is recalled. Details and sins long forgotten or covered up are brought to light. Plenty of people will have a list of good deeds: acts of charity, love, and sacrifice. All their good deeds will be carefully considered... but none of them will be good enough to gain them admittance into heaven. The good deeds they did will have an impact on where they end up in the lake of fire, however. Hell will not be the same for everyone, but it will still be eternal misery... misery you could have easily avoided.  Sinners will wish they had done just a little less evil so their punishment could be a little more tolerable. Pornographers will wish they hadn't made so many videos. Control freaks will wish they hadn't been so angry and abusive. The internet troll will wish he hadn't cursed and slung so many demeaning insults toward a stranger online. And the abortionist will wish they hadn't killed any pre-born infants. All sins will be exposed. There's no way out... unless...  Unless you accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you're a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His free gift of salvation and grace. It's all yours... free for the taking! Jesus is the only way to get out of what's coming soon upon this world. I know you've probably heard ""Jesus loves you"" a million times in your life, and it probably sounds like an empty mantra by now... but it really is the truth! Do you know why you exist? Have you ever stopped and pondered about that...? Nothing in this life comes to be without God's approval first. That means that God thought¬† you were so worth the effort that He created you!  Or maybe you're wondering, ""How do I know that only Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or what about Hinduism or Buddhism? How do I know that the Bible isn't a book of fiction and myths? In fact, what about all the starving kids in Africa? If God is so ""just and loving,"" explain that one!"" These are incredibly valid questions that deserve real answers. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with?  If you have deep questions related to God, or if you're just remotely curious about Him... I encourage you to search out these authors. I'll even list some of their books that address just about any issue or question you could have about God:  Frank Turek- ""Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case""  Andreas Kostenberger- ""Truth Matters""  Louis Markos- ""Apologetics for the 21st Century""  Norman L. Geisler- ""When Skeptics Ask,"" ""I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist""  C.S. Lewis- ""Mere Christianity""  Lee Strobel- ""The Case For Christ,"" ""The Case For A Creator,"" ""The Case For Grace""  Ravi Zacharias- ""The End of Reason,"" ""Jesus Among Other Gods,"" ""Can Man Live Without God?"" ""Why Suffering?""  Philip Yancey- ""Reaching For The Invisible God,"" ""Disappointment With God""  Also, the ""One Minute Apologist"" right here on YouTube offers quick videos that tackle tough questions about God.  **  Why am I telling you all this? Especially when this has absolutely nothing to do with the video you're watching? Simple: to warn you. To offer you a life line. Deep down, if you have discernment and common sense, you can tell something is dreadfully wrong with this world and something in your heart is telling you to get right with God before it's too late. Don't ignore that voice! Listen to it, no matter how small it is. I'm just a beggar telling other beggars where they can go to find the Bread of Life.  Don't let anything stop you from finding God. To quote Erwin Lutzer: ""Standing at the Great White Throne Judgment will be hordes from every country of the world, from every religion in the world, with the best intentions in the world. They will learn too late that God is serious about justice, and if Christ does not bear their punishment, they must bear their own.""  Don't lose your life! Let Christ save you while there's still time.",0,0,OtterloopB,tJfDBSWYqU8,0.08249744769119773,2018-05-04 19:56:31,True,True

2018-05-05T06:47:22,Actually what the fuck is happening at 1:48 ? He shoots a flaming arrow (that would have been blown out because... well blow at a flame. Now imagine what its like for a arrow shot from a war bow)eitherway the arrow hits a closed hatch which then... explodes from the inside? Looking at it closely the arrow is just a crappy fire arrow that you could probably put out by blowing on it. The part of the hatch he shot is indeed closed.  Yet it explodes violently from the inside. That's... kind of confusing. What would cause such a reaction? Looking at the thickness of the metal theres no way it would  heat up enough for anything inside to catch fire. Not only that but it blows out the hatch alongside all the rivets holding it in place. Dear god what was inside that? But then again the whole tank thing looks like its from WW1/WW2. If only because there is no way they could build such a thing in the era it's suppose to be in. I mean look at those large sheets of metal! Look at how perfectly flat they are. I mean that's understandable for a movie but once again... something you'd disguise if you cared.

So now they've got the kid from Kingsman playing Robin of Locksley? Is he gonna be the new bond after Daniel Craig gets too old? He seems to be making his way through the action movie circuit and doing quite well for himself. Although I agree that Hollywood is full of Hacks like those at Disney who are ruining other beloved franchises that should be raking in the moolah. I say that we clean out all of the stupid ass old men, new wave SJW idiots, and the deplorable feminazis that use our entertainment for their political platform. I'd rather not watch a movie that is a political statement masquerading as an action movie. If I want politics I'll go to a town hall or a Government rally, not to a movie where I expect to be entertained not offended by the bullshit agendas trying to be pushed, not so eloquently mind you, down the audiences' collective throats. This is a prevalent issue in Hollywood that should be addressed. When a certain franchise has a set mythology/storytelling device already set up and one hipster new age idiot decides he wants to make the next in a series within said franchise be his ""new art piece"" to make a name for himself rather than sticking to the outlined mythos, then that is fundamentally flawed and wrong.

I imagine I'll be entertained with it, as long as I don't go in a mood where I take it all too seriously. It looks like what they're trying to do, aside from the nonsense timeline where it looks like a mash-up of everything vaguely old European, the plot itself seems more realistic on the vigilante idea. Robin Hood is a vague hero, not necessarily stealing from the king in a saturday morning rivalry with his usual slogans and merry men, but rather as just a vigilante willing to damage ""the man"". He's treated as such. A bounty, a cultural icon, others using his name, and while this has happened to an extent in past, it seems this is the sort of image and idea they want to market and make a big deal of, numerous times in the trailer. The riots, the dialogue, its all about the ""Gasp! Who's this daring crook, and why is he stirring up the rabble!?"". Of course the story will still focus on a heroic guy who gets the girl, and does convenient tricks and plot armor, with a backstory, but I think the angle around him is less of the romanticized hero that robs a false king of his ill-gotten gold, and more of a movement starter to suit the times of our social media outrage, in-groups, and of course the pop culture dark knight vigilante stuff. I could be wrong, this is just a trailer, but if this is the image they want to show... maybe its their aim? Then again, considering how sloppily fictional the setting, at the end of the day this ain't Robin's bow skills at work. I imagine this is just a sloppy popcorn flick wearing the mask of a fable hero. As a fan of folk heroes and such, I love anything new with some effort, but it probably won't be as incredible as already present and successful Robin Hoods.",0,0,jgunner280,tJfDBSWYqU8,0.04302112029384756,2018-05-07 04:39:41,True,True

2018-05-09T18:17:56,"Check your history. Not all black people were slaves. There were Moors in medieval England, some were quite wealthy. Obviously no American accent, but there were many black people around in those days. The problem is that we modern people think that in the past, all races stated in their homelands and didn't travel (someone literally suggested this to me once). If so then how did Northmen (Viking) artifacts end up in Muslim graves? The Moors of Iberia (modern day Spain and North Africa) were an advanced culture. They had books and libraries and universities long before most other civilizations. Look it up and you will find Africans who ruled in India as aristocrats and intermarried with East Indians (their offspring were called Habshi, among other names). In 1991's ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, Morgan Freeman was cast as a Moor who assisted Robin Hood (Kevin Costner). No, the original Robin Hood had no Moors as I recall, but I think this version takes its cue from the 1991 film. Will we ever see a true from-the-classic Robin Hood film? Probably not, because Hollywood makes money off of beefing up old stories. Still, let's watch this first and pass judgement later. Remember Russell Crowe's version of Robin Hood? Many said it would surpass Kevin Costner's version. It flopped, and the 1991 version still holds up today, especially when you consider the great Sean Connery cameoed as King Richard the Lion-hearted at the very end of RH:PoT.",22,9,Locktwiste72,tJfDBSWYqU8,0.17355072463768118,2018-05-09 18:17:56,True,True

I don't get why these can't be their own thing. Maybe they want the controversy and the vitriol for  publicity but that didn't help King Arthur (2017) at the box office. Did it now?    All I'm saying is that if movies like this were allowed to run free they would be better off. Why  limited yourself to a property your going to dishonor anyway. What if rather than a new Alien  movie in 2017, we had gotten a new Ridley Scott Sci-fi IP? Love or hate that movie wouldn't that  have been better?

It would have been epic to have ridley completed his trilogy. Honestly if I was him I would have even if I didnt even make any money on it I still would have made the entire trilogy just to spite the viewers with no brain that hated it.   If only more people were capable of seeing the bigger picture, Ridley scott first outing with robin hood wasnt well recieved  because of the slow start of the story which was building up to the merry men in tights in the sequels... He was building the character up.  I applaude that effort Id rather have a long film which goes into great detail... yeah some might be bored by the slow build up but thats what it takes to create compelling stories that dont just rush straight into mission impossible action scenes with very little restraint.   Probably wont ever get another good historical epic again till some rich producer/director is willing to lose a butt load of money at the box office. Cause most period films cost a good budget and make very little back at the box office because lack of a targeted audience which is mainly due to the fact less and less people are going to the movies now with easier means of viewing film at home.  And high ticket prices which result in you pretty much buying the blue ray itself if you just wait for release.   Eventually someone will drop a 300million dollar movie budget for something epic and will be willing to lose it all or make back half just to show their vision.

Like, sure, it has way over the top action for a medieval movie, couple of scenes with some sub-par acting and the story could always be better, but i genuinely had a good time watching this movie. I had zero expectations going in after reading critics, but decided to watch it anyways cause fuck critics. If you don't watch it looking for ""hidden antifa meaning"" and other bullshit which a lot of commenters here obviously do, and just take it for what it is, it's a pretty cool movie. I'm not an expert or anything, but I generally love a good fantasy movie, and that's what it is. It isn't prince of thieves, and it's definatly not trying to be. It isn't trying to revolutionize Robin Hood or anything, so stop taking so much fucking offense, lol. It's an action fantasy movie based on the story of Robin Hood, and a pretty cool one at that. It has all the things that makes a cool Robin Hood movie cool. Steal from the rich, give to the poor, nasty villain you hate the face of from first sight, cool medieval setting etc. The only thing i wished was better was the love interest, but to be fucking honest, i wish that about every Robin Hood movie and I like pretty much all of them (except the Russel Crowe one, damn that's boring, please don't be offended). Think maybe the cartoon has the best one.  My point is, don't go into to this movie expecting a historically accurate rendering of the old Robin Hood movies you know and love, cause then you're obviously gonna hate it, duh.
