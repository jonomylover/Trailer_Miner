2016-02-11T22:16:26,"ALTERNATE CIVIL WAR ENDING: The South wins the Civil War with British and French help, but in WWI, we (and our German and Austrian allies) manage to eliminate the Confederates, who flee to Europe and Mexico. Shortly thereafter, Canada and Ireland are invaded as unrestricted submarine warfare guts the economy of the U.K. France surrenders to Germany/Austria, Canada is carved into American states (1928, 29-32), and Ireland becomes an American Protectorate. America vows to return to isolationism after the war; Britain vows its Empire will survive. The badly beaten French vow revenge for this loss; in 1929, a French Nationalist (and WWI survivor) named DeGaulle rises to power in a far right party, vowing to rearm, resist, and push the Kaiser into the Baltic. Several far right parties coalesce around DeGaulle, and his speeches become things of spectacle. When civil war breaks out in Spain, he sends more than fifty thousand French Soldiers to eliminate the 'dangerous' socialist Republic. France declares itself ""Nationaliste"" Spain, by 1930, is an ally, under General Francisco Franco. Italy joins into this alliance in 1932. The U.K. flirts with joining, but does not. Meanwhile, the Germans are being bled dry by the 'Great Northern War' which pitted the German Empire and Finland against the Soviet Union in a defensive war against the Soviets expanding into the Baltic states and Finland. With their economies weakened, the Austrians collapse (in 1934) leading to several years of disarray before another government can be seated.The Monarchy is gone, however. In 1935, mass protests and riots cripple Germany itself, and Frederick III is assassinated in Leipzig, ostensibly by French provacateurs.  America, meanwhile, fights a dirty war against Mexican Guerrillas, armed and trained by the fleeing Confederates and Anglo-French mercenaries. Whole villages are quietly eliminated, and thousands of soldiers die in the relentless, tireless war of attrition. As President Teddy Roosevelt laments 'There are no good wars; only good men doing terrible things."" (L.A. Times, 1932)  In the Far East, Japan expands into China, Taiwan, Mongolia, and, on April 14th, 1934,  crosses the Amur River, into Siberia, with a sudden, unprovoked attack on Port Arthur that destroys the Soviet Eastern Fleet completely. This is done to get at Soviet fuel supplies, needed by the Japanese in order to expand further in China. By the end of May, 1934, more than a million Imperial Japanese Soldiers are in Siberia, and Stalin is forced to attempt making a temporary peace with the Germans to move his beleaguered forces east.  July 3rd, 1934. Stalin is killed in the Kremlin as the Germans firebomb Moscow with long range Focke-Wulf 202 Condor Bombers. *** WW2***",3,2,Ineta Life,96EChBYVFhU,0.003517316017316025,2016-02-11 22:16:26,True,True

2016-02-12T19:30:02,"This movie looks AWESOME!!! Although it's kind of sad that a movie is doing a FPS better than most games these days.  Probably one of the few possible flaws in this movie is if the main bad guys (which I'm presuming to be the guy with the buzzcut who knocks you off the bridge and holds your ""wife"" at gunpoint and the long-haired blonde dude, Hate them already so good job trailer) get lame quick deaths like a last minute decapitation or headshot.   I bring this up because in most stories, the villain IS the conflict and driving force of the story and thus they deserve a memorable sendoff (and an agonizing one in the case of despicable villains), but time and TIME again writers and directors just go for cliched, anticlimactic, and BORING deaths like headshots (I especially HATE it when the villain wails on the hero for a good 5 minutes and the hero retaliates with only one or two fatal hits.

First of all, the motion sickness, seriously, this is one of the reasons why people hate shaky cam and not it will happen for practically the whole movie since this is an action film. Second, this is the fact that I find particularly stupid, since your in a first person, you can't see your character's emotions and their hand will constantly be visible, they have to do EVERYTHING within eyesight and I found that stupid in FPS games and I find that doubly stupid in a movie. Seriously, I just cringe whenever I see the characters hands awkwardly flail around his face. And frankly, as a movie, this just feels pretentious. Like they just want to stand out from other generic action flicks so they just decided to appeal to gamers and film it in a 1st person perspective.

Ever since I saw the very first Biting elbows video, I was like ""There needs to be a movie like this, shut up and take my fucking money""  After waiting with bated breath for what seems like an eternity, this movie is finally coming out to theaters. I'm excited to see the way the writers and directors decided to tell the story, since it's all in semi-real time, and the story is going to have to be told in context to the main character and also act as expository dialogue and storytelling, which would be a challenge to say the least, not even counting the first person perspective of the movie - with that added variable, I think this movie is going to be very good. Sure it's going to be a popcorn action packed thrill ride, probably lacking in traditional storytelling - but I think that the people behind this movie will more than make up for the nontraditional approach by skillfully panning to the film's demographic.   regardless if this movie is a one off flash in the pan, or the first of many badass movies from this studio, I think it's going to be successful, if not a blockbuster, this movie has the ability to become a cult classic.

They could have at least *made the mentor/guide/exposition guy¬†female*, or *making¬†the main villain and some of the mooks female - how rare, how non-existent of female character is that?!*,.Then again, if they did, *the feminists would¬†shriek¬†and scream about 'violence against women' and 'male dominance' and other misandric shit*. Then again, a good writer would ignore them when they¬†say type of horse crap. ¬†That would lessen the *'damsel in distress being saved by patronizing, infantizing¬†man/men' bullshit.*It so very easy for me to *reverse, subvert, and generally play around with tropes and clich√©s, and yet people that make stories like **_these_**¬†are called the 'professionals'?

2016-06-22T20:50:43,Just watched this movie and it was good on most things. There was like non stop action! From the beginning to the end there's shooting and death everywhere. I liked the ending it was a kinda big twist but Henry did the decision I would have. The only flaw about this movie is that it's light on the plot. There isn't much story mostly about the mission with action. Still worth watching though. 7.5/10 maybe bigger screen and louder volume would make it more awesome.,1,0,Api Vlogs,96EChBYVFhU,0.35178571428571426,2016-06-22 20:50:43,False,True

No, it's not as ""pretty"" as Fury Road, but the action will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, with hardly any breathing room for anything else.
