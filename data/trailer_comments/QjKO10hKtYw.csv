I am a Godzilla FREAK :D) and become something memorable. Sort of like how the original Jaws transformed the monster and shark monster movie genre. Plus, Gareth Edwards is an amazing storyteller, filmmaker, director etc. who is kind of independent and very unconventional with his stories and films. He is also an expert in VFX and is one of my favorite directors of recent years. His film Monster (or was it Monsters) were excellent! He said himself that this film wasn't at all shot like most major Hollywood films. It was, according to him, shot more like an independent film in away. I can't remember exactly what he said, but I trust in him man :) It would have been awesoem to see Neil Blomkamp be sort of in on this project when it comes to the visuals (not saying they are bad, it's just because Blomkamp is another expert on VFX and is also one of my favorite recent directors.)",2,0,Lukas Sprehn,QjKO10hKtYw,0.3279761904761905,2013-12-10 21:04:17,True,True

If you look at any REAL classic Godzilla film, it was more about the monster than it was about the all star cast. This trailer had a little too much cast for me, not enough monster. The phenomenon known as a Godzilla flick is based mostly around it's destruction of whatever city it is in and the futile fight of the puny humans trying to stop it. If this is another Godzilla 2000 then this franchise will die. IF they release another trailer then I hope they release a monster fucking shit up trailer and not a speech and damage trailer.

Everything looks amazing, and Godzilla looks really really scary, however watching it several times has made me wonder the direction of the movie. Godzilla in the trailer to me really looks impersonal, and that is not what makes a Godzilla movie. A good Godzilla movie makes you identify with the creature, with Godzilla. In a Godzilla movie, Godzilla himself is a character who you are suppose to identify with. I think that's why the first American version of Godzilla did so bad in Japan. America didn't understand the mentality the Japanese had for Godzilla. He's not just some giant monster rampaging the city, this creature is for lack of a better term a person. In some Japanese movies Godzilla is clearly the good guy, in other he's the enemy. So when I look at this trailer I just see a monster. Don't get me wrong, a very scary monster, looks very impressive, but just a monster... I hope I'm wrong though.

Gipsy Danger is about 260ft (79 m). Slattern is about 596 ft (181.6 m).  In the past joked about 'wished Kaijus were real'. I seen that building first hand at San Fran, Imagining Godzilla at that height, slowly moving, the sheer amount of horror can not be translated into words.  I felt fear of godzilla when I was young, but calling that 'fear' would lie compared to this. This is horror.",2,0,Martian Buddy,QjKO10hKtYw,-0.014285714285714287,2013-12-12 11:09:21,True,True

To people saying this movie is dumb because we have the technology to beat him now, you've obviously never even watched Godzilla. His regenerative abilities make him pretty much nuke proof.

There are nearly thirty Godzilla movies and there's no sign of them ending. The 1998 one was atrocious and was probably the only one you have ever seen, so just click off somewhere else to some dumb ass movie like Jupiter Ascending.

2013-12-13T06:41:49,Im hoping this is captures the dark and cerebral mood of the eerie atomic bomb trauma that inspired the original movie after WW2. After 9-11 there was a lot more blinding dust and smoke from a few buildings collapsing than any glossy plastic hollywood action movie. This movie needs to very dark and dusty and eerie. I really hope they keep the views of Godzilla minimal and clouded. That is more emotionally frightening!! Please don't let this be another generic giant monster fighting movie appealing only to 13yr boys...

2013-12-13T19:44:53,"Ok, can I just clarify to people who only saw Godzilla 98 that this is not a squeal to that. This also has nothing to do with Pacific Rim. This is an American made Godzilla film with full on help with Toho, the company that started Godzilla franchise in 1954 all the way to 2004. This movie is suppose to have a far darker tone to original in 1954 film and is suppose to go back to the roots of what made Godzilla an indestructible force of nature and what he symbolizes. And to others who are either mad that they don't see the monster or any feelings to the characters, first its a teaser trailer, second you keep you audience in suspense by not showing the monster, for example Jaws, or the original Godzilla, until the halfway mark or towards the end. I'm just happy to see a real Godzilla film after 10 years, and to me this is how trailers are done. You don't give your entire movie away within 2-3 minutes.

Ok usually when you are about to go into battle like a major battle if you saw the smoke that means that major is about to happen also High-altitude military parachuting (or military free fall (MFF)) is a method of delivering personnel, equipment, and supplies from a transport aircraft at a high altitude via free-fall parachute insertion. Two techniques are used: HALO (high altitude - low opening) and HAHO (high altitude - high opening).  In the HALO technique, the parachutist opens his parachute at a low altitude after free-falling for a period of time, while in the HAHO technique, the parachutist opens his parachute at a high altitude just a few seconds after jumping from the aircraft. HALO techniques date back to 1960 when the U.S. Air Force was conducting experiments that followed earlier work by Colonel John Stapp in the late 1940s[1] through early 1950s on survivability factors for high-flying pilots needing to eject at high altitudes. In recent years, the HALO technique has been practiced by civilians as a form of skydiving. HALO is used for delivering equipment, supplies, or personnel, while HAHO is generally used only for personnel.  In typical HALO/HAHO insertions, the troops are dispatched from altitudes between 15,000 feet (4,600 m) and 35,000 feet (11,000 m).[ ",16,1,Woody Reviews,QjKO10hKtYw,0.042430555555555555,2013-12-19 22:01:27,True,True

All the people making it are fans of the franchise (genuinely) and Toho company have had a hand in it's creation and overseeing some elements. Not saying it'll make it a great film but it sure as hell gives it a running head start over films where half the cast didn't even know what the fuck they where doing with the source material (Enders Game),3,5,James Davies,QjKO10hKtYw,0.11666666666666668,2013-12-25 17:58:07,True,True

2014-02-26T20:27:11,"On trailers like these, I like to look at the details and speculate  Main Trailer: 0:13 The airliner (Airbus A 380 or 340) appears that it made an emergency landing. Mechanical failure? EMP? Glancing blow? 0:25 Linear accelerator? Obviously some sort of underground science lab for physics.... 0:29 Same underground lab? Is it military, or is it civilian and the military is coming in? 0:36 Glancing blow by tail would be my guess, otherwise it would have been completely flattened. 0:40 prisoner? That glass partition, and he wants to ""Talk to someone in charge"". 0:44 If it is deep enough to pass under the carrier, it shouldn't be visible from the surface, especially if there is particulate matter and those search lights would create glare. Also, at that size, it should be crushed by it's own weight, especially on land. (Science SNAFU #1 and #2) 0:50 Thank goodness those destroyers were of to the sides of that dorsal spine. And that wave is going to cause problems.... 0:51 They're fucked 1:01 What is that fluid? That is radioactive waste that the USSR dumped, and it has a very nasty gash in it. Carried on land by Godzilla? Radiation doesn't cause mutations like this.... (Science SNAFU #3) 1:08 More than one creature, or just one? Judging from dialogue it can be guessed that they failed, yet we see the remains of one? 1:18 Shockwave is to slow, and sound comes on to early and shouldn't crescendo like that (Science Snafu #4) 1:25 Big gun? EM railgun? 1:28 Human weapon, or Godzilla eggs? Construction BY Godzilla? 1:29 Vessel or base? 1:31 Something big diving followed by the jets. thank you +Sandwichman1337 for pointing that out. I missed that on my first run through. 1:33 Three USMC assault carriers, so the jets are probably F-35Bs, soon to be used by the United States Marine Corps (Ooh-rah) 1:36 HALO jump. Spotters for artillery or do they have a¬† special weapon? 1:40 Civilian bunkers? 1:44 obviously they can be killed 1:47 Golden Gate. San Francisco. 1:50 The military jets were in flat spins, meaning stalls. I am guessing that they get a very nasty tailwind or glancing blows. EMP or mechanical failure are not likely because they should glide, and I saw an F-35 [probably a B model (I hope to get my hands on one of those) because of the lines on the back of the fuselage at 1:53] pilot punch out. 1:53 Canopy is still closed, so somebody didn't punch out.... Why? Pilot error or mechanical? Or is the pilot incapacitated (High G spins can knock you out)? 2:03 Signal flares. Danger close? 2:11 That Blackhawk has an engine fire and tail rotor failure (judging from direction of spin) 2:18 That classic roar and title....Ôªø  Teaser: 0:01 HALO jump means close-quarters action, so I expect that they have a weapon. 0:15 A whole platoon? 0:28 C-17 Globemaster III. Smoke flares to prevent collision with other jumpers. Also, for that cargo bay, it should be wider if it is a C-17. 0:47 Electrically charged smoke? I see a fair sized risk of the jumpers getting struck. 1:19 I still think that is a Linear accelerator. Obviously some sort of underground science lab for physics, either military or civilian. 1:20 What is the purpose of the train? Probably not armoured because it won't make a difference, but would probably set it down. And why a cargo train? 1:27 Obviously a military bunker 1:28 HAZMAT suit. Bio, chem, or nuclear weapon? 1:32 Crashing, or simply exploding on the tarmac? 1:34 What the fuck is that? nuclear torpedo? Suicide nuke for the ship to ram with? Some other weapon? 1:38 Underground or on a ship? Again, why HAZMAT? 1:40 Yeah, armor on the train won't help.... And that train is FUBAR.",4,0,Jeremy Truesdell,QjKO10hKtYw,-0.0524543276430069,2014-02-26 20:27:11,True,True

2014-12-25T03:19:14,"I don't understand why most people hated it. Although it wasn't the best action/sci-fi movie compared to the other options available, Godzilla wasn't too terrible as reviewed.¬†  1. Godzilla's appearance. Yes, Godzilla got a little screen time as hoped but it was for a valid reason. The movie portray Godzilla as nature's weapon against enormous creature. Its a basic logic of food chain. There can only be one predator who can be dominant. Godzilla, who had stayed dominant for years, needs to establish his power. Thus, acts like a predator, tracking his prey and coming in for the sneak attack. Of course he is not going to get a lot of screen time! He being late for the party makes him adds more to his bad-ass character.¬†  2. As for the characters, I felt that it was imperative that they kill off the scientist. In most sci-fi movies, it is the crazy maniac that drives the plot and the search for the solution to the conflict. The father dying was important for the son to gain closure and understanding of the truth of the creatures. Plus, because of his death, the story line became more original. It became a story of a soldier trying to get home to his family in midst of a crisis. He was willing to do whatever it takes to do so. Everyone else were simply bystanders to nature's course.¬†  3. Military's failure to learn their lesson. The Japanese scientist mentioned that man's arrogance is that they think they can control/dominate nature. This movie depicts that very arrogance. ¬†They don't trust what they don't know. They use whatever they have at their disposal to take care of a threat. They think they are powerful enough to take care of any threat. Thus, they continue to do stupid mistakes because they are incapable of thinking beyond their ego and understanding that their power is limited compared nature. Their mistakes and put into positions where they are powerless was to show how little we are compared to the forces of nature.¬†  Overall, I thought the movie did an okay job of displaying the theme- humans are not as powerful as they seem to be. Nature can take care of itself and should not be tampered with. Switching the perspective from a scientist searching for answers to a soldier. It ¬†made the movie original. A soldier trying to get to his family added a more human element to the mix which made it all the more enjoyable. The action sequences were intense and never a let down. The ending where Godzilla collapses out of exhaustion was realistic and I'm glad they added it. The movie was not a complete letdown as made out to be.",52,11,Sandra Meesala,QjKO10hKtYw,0.07611664820967147,2014-12-25 03:19:14,False,False

Just look at the sky diving scene! The music captures the uncertainty of those soldiers survival from these monsters bellow the clouds.

Still though, I think the trailer is actually better than the movie, but this is one of the best trailers I have ever seen. I actually have a theory about this trailer and how it had an impact on the final movie so if you want to hear it, bare with me.  So in this first trailer we see a few shots.The Halo Jump shows Godzilla slowly walking through the city as the troops fall. The Airport scene where the train breaks (I am not sure if it is actually different but in this it looks like Godzilla's hand going through it.) And also the planes exploding which does not show any monsters. Finally there is the shot of Godzilla concealed by dust and debris.  Each of these shots were changed (In the case of the last one, removed) for the final cut of the movie. Even in the official trailer when Elle Brody is going into the bunker, we see only Godzilla roaring and in the movie it is changed again to include the Muto. Now what I think may have happened is that when people seen this, they were excited, but did not want a repeat of '98. They did not want the military to kill Godzilla, but also the writers didnt want him to destroy everything and not have room for a sequel. So then people wanted more monsters so as to make it feel more like a Godzilla film. I think Godzilla was originally intended to be the bad guy. I think he was going to be the one who was going to attack humanity and it was up to us to stop him. Which I feel would have been the absolute best way to go about it, sort of like '84 but with a different ending.    Now I could be wrong and in all likelihood I probably am, but still, I kind of like to think about it xD",1,0,BattleKid619,QjKO10hKtYw,0.12068965517241381,2017-04-12 11:18:28,False,False
