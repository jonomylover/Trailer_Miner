2016-07-23T20:41:59,"I really hope it doesn't make those empowered women jokes all throughout the film. A strong female film does not need to keep referencing and poking fun at old male-female dynamics to be an inspiring and empowering thing for women. Just by the virtue that Wonder Woman is the biggest badass in the world should be enough without having to blame all the inequality, evil and anything bad that's ever happened ever, on men... Like Mad Max essentially did. This movie looks great, I really hope it doesn't lose itself by trying to make such a strong point about feminism that it forgets to tell a good story.

Captain America was created during the height of WWII, hence his origin story being tied to that period.  Wonder Woman was conceived during the same damn time period, but they changed it for the DCEU.  A big clue would be their costumes being so STRONGLY based on the American flag. FFS, her costume had STARS on it. Stars for WW, Star and stripes for CA -- sound familiar?   Wonder Woman could have been set during WWII and been accurate to her origin without ripping off Captain America. They were both conceived during a highly patriotic period in our nation's history, during a World War, and with an American flag-based costume.  Their origin stories have nothing to do with each other, and DC isn't ""ripping off Marvel."" Only idiots who've never read a comic in their lives think that.

They should've gone with someone who could actually act & who would be more believable instead of just going with the popular pretty girl from the Fast & Furious Franchise but no, they chose to go with a pretty-yet-hyper-skinny broad & decided that relying on CGI & wire work would make her look somewhat tough.

He  was interested in the women's suffrage movement and in Margaret Sanger,  the birth control and women's rights activist ‚Äî who was also his  mistress's aunt.  ...Wonder Woman is an Amazon from an island of women who left ancient  Greece to escape the enslavement of men. And they lived on Paradise  Island and had eternal life. And a plane crashes on their island  carrying a man ‚Äî and Wonder Woman's mother decides he needs to be  brought back to where he came from because they can have no men on  Paradise Island.  ...Marston has all kinds of ties to the early progressive-era suffrage  and feminist and birth control movements ‚Äî sort of an uncanny number and  complexity of ties.   ... One of the things that's a defining element of Wonder Woman is that if a man ¬†binds her in chains, she loses all of her Amazonian strength. So in almost every  episode of the early comics, the ones that Marston wrote [Marston  stopped writing Wonder Woman in 1947], she's chained up or she's roped  up ... and she has to break free of these chains. ... That's [what]  Marston would always say ‚Äî ""in order to signify her emancipation from  men."" But those chains are a really important part of the feminist and  suffrage struggles of the 1910s that Marston had a front-row seat for.  ...In the shadow of what's going on in Europe [the Nazi uprising], it's  very terrifying to imagine kids worshiping this Ubermensch (Superman). And so  [Marston] says [to Gaines], ""Look, if you had a female superhero, her  powers could all be about love and truth and beauty, and you could also  sell your comic books better to girls.

Are you kidding me, I thought the 50s and 60s were over... portray germans as evil nazis in WW2 if you must hollywood - it¬¥s reductive, inaccurate most of the time and if you ask me, harmful when it comes to the influence on modern, historically illiterate movie publics, but FINE, I get it, the horrific crimes of that regime justify even comical exagerations to some extent...  BUT WW1? A war in which the UK, France, the german Empire, the austrian Empire, the russian Empire and probably some more need to take about equal blame for? A war in which soldiers on both sides knew they were all so similar, they hated their own leadership more than the ones they shot at? A war in which the horrors of the trench warfare and industrial use of humans as fuel for the war engine should overshadow ANY silly ""heroism""? THAT war is the one where we ll see a heroic wonder woman beating up normal humans that did no wrong except being on the wrong end of the front line?   Right, right, no one cares about history, do what you like, I get it. Respecting the 10 million that died in that war 100 years ago isnt done that way.

I've been reading Wonder Woman since the 80's and then some amazing TPB and HC from before then. from that I could say full heartedly that Wonder Woman would despise the feminist movement today (third wave feminism to be more precise), but she wouldn't stand on the opposite side either, she would oppose both and create a new movement that doesn't crap all over one side, she would set an example to rid the huge hypocrisy of feminists today and hate of anti feminists today. a key aspect of her character was that she never sided with a specific gender, rather she just called out the bs whenever she saw it despite the disparagement she would face because she was a woman in 'man's world'. the setting and time period of this movie however should have her side with females more often but not as a whole, which I have hope will be delivered by telephone creative team. my fear is Zack Snyder and how he is going to write her gender perception in the modern world. Like before, I believe he is just going to butcher key elements of the character because he has 'a vision' as he did with Superman and kinda Batman already, there wasn't enough Wonder woman in BvS for him to do that to her, but in JL...

She's still skinny af), but I'll give the film a chance, now that Geoff Johns is head of DC films. Not to mention, the film seems to get WW's origins right, the costume actually has color, and that theme song though. The end of the trailer, that was a funny joke, I'm not gonna lie. I hope the film doesn't go overboard with that, there can be 2 or 3 jokes based on WW thinking that women in the 1940s in certain jobs are slaves or something(which would be funnier when WW is in modern day), but if that goes overboard, they'll be reaching Feminazi territory like the terrible Ghostbusters reboot did(now I'm imagining WW beating down any Feminazi she comes across. Has that happened in the comics? I hope.)  But again, DC is straight up ripping off Marvel's films. Justice League rips off a bit of Avengers 1 & Civil War, while Wonder Woman rips off Captain America: The First Avenger. Seriously, a hero that kicks ass in a World War, was gone for a few decades, and came back in modern day. I'll be fair, *tons* of comic book characters did that(especially during WW2), and both characters were made in the same year, 1941(but Capt came first, in March, while WW was made in December). Also, in the comics, Wonder Woman fought in WW2 as well, but this film changed that to WW1. Which is funny, DC's trying so hard to be Marvel, I'm shocked they changed that, but there's still a lot of similarities, like Wonder Woman using an unbreakable shield, and the guy's name being Steve Trevor(seriously, I can't be the only one, that thought the woman said Steve Rogers. And guy even looks like him a little bit).   I don't remember WW using a shield that much.

The only character interaction was ""You're a man, I have no daddy."" and the only part I actually almost liked was the punchline at the end with ""I like her."" I am so confused about what DC has been doing lately. This could have been a much shorter teaser where it showed her finding dude bro, then showed her traveling to the ""real"" world, then showed her in the sword dress, then showed him saying I can't let you murder folks, then show a single epic fight scene, and then show the ""I like her"" closer. Instead, this is just...... filler. Which to me usually says that there isn't going to be any substance to really pull from.  Wonder woman deserves to be more than just an out of touch, single-minded murdering machine, and this gives me no indication that she'll be anything but.  As a woman, as a comic book fan, as a frequent movie-goer, and as a person who values storytelling done well..... I am not excited.

What happen to the Al Pacino's, Robert De Niro's  and the Sydney Poitier's that didn't have the good looks but their acting was phenomenal. Today they put Jennifer Lawrence in a movie and she's nominated for an Oscar. Today HOLLYWOOD nominates base on how popular the actor is, not on how great their role was.  No one in Silver Lining Playbook should have not one an Oscar. Black people are never popular, so we will never win shit. Every now and then they throw us a bone, and it's always a black women, because that eliminates both parts..black and a women. Even the poor Latinos and the Asians get more of a raw deal then us. Hollywood is not a diverse business. The only black movies that get made or comedies, romantic comedies, or period pieces or in another  term black struggle movies. Why we always struggling.

It's just hardwired into everyone's heads that a strong woman is a bad woman, when it honestly isn't. I will personally go watch this movie because it's a change of pace compared to most of the superhero movies where 99% of the time the protagonist is male.  And for the record, I'm a guy myself.

2016-07-24T06:17:50,"1. Wonder Woman predates Captain America. So Wonder Woman is not copying Captain America. It is more accurate to say that Captain America is based on Wonder Woman than it is to say that Wonder Woman is copying Captain America. The only reason it ""appears"" that way is because Captain America has had numerous films, so more people know of him. 2. It is incorrect to say that women could not vote during the timeframe of this Wonder Woman movie. Focusing on the USA, some states, Nevada and Montana, gave women suffrage in 1914. Since WW1 began in 1914 it is safe to say that jokes about women staying in the kitchen and not voting shows your ignorance of history. If you were to say that American woman could not vote nationally until 1920 that is a more accurate statement. 3. DC and Marvel are two different companies. Comparing WW and Justice League to Black Widow and the Avengers is reductive and lazy. Some people, myself included, are able to like two things at once. We don't NEED to choose a side. It is perfectly logical to like both DC and Marvel. 4. Those jokes about women staying in the kitchen are now lame. It's not 2007. Every youtube video has someone making that joke. You're not witty or smart. You are just another douche who has nothing to say on topic so you proceed to make a joke to get a few likes. Grow up. 5. Its best to read the comics before you watch the movies so that you aren't asking stupid questions that are clearly answered in the book.",2,0,afsdafsfd dsgsdfgsd,5lGoQhFb4NM,0.12845804988662135,2016-07-24 06:17:50,True,True

It looks like more of the same as we got from her in BvS and I didn't like it there either.  She's just too perfect and too powerful to the point that it's ridiculous and not even close to believable.  Good characters have flaws and weaknesses even when they are strong and powerful, and I mean serious flaws and weaknesses and in that, we find relatability and form connections with those characters.  There's no connection to be made with a character who is perfect.  I mean, if she's as powerful and unstoppable as she's portrayed in BvS and this trailer, why would there be a need for a Justice League at all?  Like I said, I know my opinion is in the minority, but I this looks like another blunder for DC.  I mean, the visuals are great, the special effects look great, and the music is great, but a good movie needs more than good visuals, effects, and music.

The guy creates stunning visual fight scenes but i hope he sticks to that area of the movies as consultant and never as a lead director.

Wonder Woman fights in what appears world war 1, and Captain America fights during World War 2. These two beginner movies (being the first of the series) seem to be very much alike. But then again in a comic universe people with super-human powers tend to bleed over because there are numbered powers that are truly super-human.

Gal was already 2nd best thing in BvS after Batfleck, now she's looking perfection in this one as she gets more time to express herself. Mamoa is fucking badass in JL footage, even more badass than his Drago in GoT. Miller also shined in that footage. It will be different from TV's Gustin, and I was quite impressed.

I do hope that Danny Huston general character is Ares in disguise, as it would be just so boring to see Wonder Woman fight German soldiers the whole film. I also hope there is a good balance between dark material and humor, however there's no way to tell with this trailer. I don't want too much dark material, that was one of my problems with BvS. However, I don't want too much humor, as this does take place in World War I. There should be an equal amount of both to my eyes.

2016-07-24T16:42:33,"The statement "".. I had no father. I was brought to life by Zeus..."" is very specific and absolutely unambiguous. The general movie-going public, which a 'blockbuster' film of this nature must appeal to in order to achieve big box office, will recognize Zeus above all other Olympian gods. Never mind that he literally fathers her in the New 52, or that Diana was born of clay and Aphrodite's divine intervention in Marston's defining origin story. This approach is a nice combination of canon, minus Perez's take, and makes it abundantly clear to audiences that she is of a mythical and divine nature. That's all Joe and Jane Q. Public need to know. I've been a fan of WW since 1968 and am ready to accept most retellings of her origin. As with many heroes and deities of ancient myth, origins and details change depending on the storyteller, the era and even the region or cultural context. That is what makes such characters mythic. This fledgeling trailer aside,  I would be very, very surprised if Jenkins / Johns screw up this film.

2016-07-24T20:05:06,"What a great looking trailer. Love the music too. I'm trying to piece the plot together. From what I can tell, Steve Trevor is somehow undercover as a German fighter pilot. What's weird is he is wearing the Pour l'Merite ""Blue Max"" medal around his neck. This award was not readily given out to just any fighter pilot. You needed upwards of 20+ kills to earn one. So he is pretending to be a hot shot German ace? He flies a German Fokker E.III Eindecker in the trailer. This plane was out of service by the time the U.S. entered the war so doesn't look like they stuck to historical accuracy. It's Hollywood so that is usually the case. Looks like Trevor is found out and he attacks the German airfield to escape? I'm betting this is the opening action sequence. He then flies over the ocean and crashes washing up on the shore of the Amazon;s home island. But in what ocean? That is certainly not the English Channel and the range on the Eindecker is not far so reaching the Med is out of the question. So how does the movie work that out? And based on the beach scenes in the trailer the Germans appear to somehow follow Trevor to the island and then they come ashore and the Amazons kick their ass. Then Diana decides to help Trevor get back to England and the war and she agrees to help the Allies beat the Germans? Not sure what the motivation for her is here. Maybe because she falls in love with Trevor? Then the rest of the movie is Wonder Woman battling the Kaiser's army etc. to accomplish some currently unknown goal and probably picking up a motley group of friends along the way. The fight scenes and battle scenes do look cool though. WWI is very en vogue right now since it was 100 years ago.   About choosing WWI over the WW2 setting is interesting, but probably because Captain America already went there and there is no controversy over using Nazi symbols etc. since the Allies are fighting Kaiser Wilhelm and not Hitler. However, there will be similarities with Captain America's story. I don't think it is avoidable. But who cares, Gal Gadot is super hot as Wonder Woman and that theme music is awesome!",3,0,Jason Williams,5lGoQhFb4NM,0.15399659863945578,2016-07-24 20:05:06,True,True

2016-07-25T04:07:59,"I feel like they're rushing all of this (my opinion), they already did doomsday and the death of superman storylines, a huge problem I see with this film is that they have to introduce 3 new characters in this universe, if they did it like marvel where they waited 4 years to their big get-together film I feel like this would look so much better, I feel like they should have started their universe in this layout ""Man of Steel (2013)""  ""Batman (2013)"" ""Wonder Woman (2014)"" ""The Flash (2014)"" ""Aquaman (2015)"" ""Cyborg (2015"" ""Martian Manhunter (2015)"" ""Green Lantern (2015) THEN ""Justice League in 2016. With that plan we would be familiar with all these characters and know all their back stories and their motivations, There are other things that are wrong, Batman kills which really bothers me (I know he used guns and killed in the 40s and I know he's killed in the past but only once in awhile and only when he was pushed to his limit. I don't like seeing him holding a Machine Gun mowing down people) Batman is very anti guns and anti killing, to him it's what stops him from becoming the criminals he fights, and what stops him from killing the villains such as the joker if he just mows down people with guns (He's pretty much the punisher at this point lol) Also I feel like he should be just starting out, Like you can't have a 50 year old Batman and a 20 year old Joker it just doesn't work. Also I think Suicide Squad and spin offs should be in phase two. Suicide squad should have the villains from the solo movies from phase one so we would know them and understand their characters and motivations, unlike the ""Suicide Squad (2016) coming out this year where they are all new characters in this universe, Suicide Squad then would be so much more interesting because we would have witnessed them in the phase one films and know who they are. To me that would have been a such better DCEU and then at the end of this universe they could do BvS then the last Superman movie which has the death of superman and Doomsday but unlike in ""Bvs (2016)"" we would have really grown to know and love this superman unlike ""BvS (2016) where literally no one in my theater was sad (and I saw the movie on the Thursday right before the movie officially came out so the theater was all full of fans). To me this whole universe looks rushed and lazy just to compete with marvel. If they just took more time in releasing films then we would have an amazing universe, but as it stands now they will always be the worse superhero universe out of the two (Marvel and DC).",0,10,JacobDoesMovies,5lGoQhFb4NM,0.12017453446024874,2016-07-25 04:07:59,True,True

Mrs. Patty Jenkins: I hope this unbalanced trailer is just a (silly) way to reassure fearful and misogynists execs that the movie will attract male audiences, but the movie has to be different, it has to be about HER and the AMAZONS: so please we want to see more Diana, more Amazons kicking ass, more Robin Wright and LESS Chris Pine.",0,0,T B75,5lGoQhFb4NM,-0.054629629629629625,2016-07-25 07:06:24,True,True

You are nothing, yet God found you worthy to die for.¬†Without believing Jesus is God means you know not God. Sin brings death. the wages of sin are death the Word says. The only thing to fix our seperation from God through sin is the blood of a sacrifice, and that sacrifice has to be perfect or the payment isn't permanent. since we are all born in sin, no one meets that standard. Cleary since the only one to meet Gods standard is God, God goes Himself as Jesus.¬† God became a man, Jesus Christ, and lived the sinless life we couldnt. He willingly took all the wrath of God that was met to be poured on us for all the evil that we are, and He bore it. He took the full force of Gods punishment, becoming our sin and dying with it. Because a perfect sacrifice was the only way to pay a dept for a people as sinful as we are. Someone had to die, so he did it Himself. Cause He wanted us back for Himself.¬†He became payment for a people who could not redeem themselves. Then He rose again, defeating death and the grave. That meant the redemption was guaranteed, For all who believe.¬†¬†We serve a living God who payed our dept. All you have to do to be declared innocent is Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. That His death was enough to pay the penalty for your sins and live a life style of repentance. Which means to change ones mind. To turn away from sin, God makes you a new man in Christ, He is the one who regenerates your person to make you a New Creature. With a new heart and new mind who hates to do sin, and to displease God. When we do sin, which we all do, we will repent and ask God for His mercy and Grace to help us to never do it again.God is real, and weither you believe in Him or not, you will stand before Him. It comes down to you believe on Jesus or you die and go to hell. Theres no way around it and no way to sugercoat it for you. Its one or the other.

I always liked the fact DC was dark to be honest I see all these comments saying stuff about how DC is so dark but I don't know I kind of like that it feels more real and not just like a cotton candy fluff movie.

And it's not because I'm not a Wonder Woman fan.  I wasn't a Guardians of the Galaxy fan, either, and the trailers for that had me anticipating the film for months.  Though my not being a fan has me wondering if I missed something in the Wonder Woman lore that makes her immortal, since she apparently hasn't aged a day since WWII (Or is it WWI?  Heck if I can tell anymore thanks to all the damn military shooter games out today).  Or maybe this is just DC trying to ape Captain America.

For those that don't understand why it bothers some people you should understand that I personally hate it when movies go out of their way to insert vestigial black characters into scripts as an afterthought. They do it for political correctness and to not have all white casts but the effect is to create meaningless characters that are often underdeveloped and usually used for comic relief. So when there is an opportunity to stay true to source material and utilize characters of color that aren't vestigial afterthoughts and then they go in and cut those characters out that becomes annoying.,3,6,Andre S.,5lGoQhFb4NM,-0.11666666666666665,2016-07-27 16:36:42,True,True

2016-07-27T17:23:00,A few points of criticism. I'm not completely sold on the Justice League movie yet with the new trailer. I don't think the actress playing Wonder Woman was the best casting choice as her build is more model then amazon women and her facial features are not stern/sharp like the character should have. Part of why Marvel works so well is that most of the characters are a near perfect resemblance to what the comic character looks like. But those criticisms aside this movie looks like it could be a winner like Suicide Squad. It seems to have its own theme going and the story appears to be more about a journey then the go to save the world movie. Because it's DC and they don't make the best decisions with their movies I remain a bit skeptical but this gives me a similar impression and period style as Captain America. The difference is that this movie maybe solely focused on its own story and not trying to set up others so it might actually beat Captain America since they made his period piece a bit too short setting up the Avengers.,0,0,Kevin W.

Keep on this track and you will be able to compete with Marvel but I think you should still lighten the mood and lighten up on the filters a bit. The entire DC universe doesn't need to look like it's constantly cloudy weather. They did the same with the last few Harry Potter movies.

This....this feels like they actually took the time and effort to get the tone right, the characterization accurate and the lore as close as they could to the source material (or a mix of elements from various pieces of the source material at any rate).  It looks to me as though while Marvel's superheroines have fallen by the wayside or taken second fiddle for almost a whole decade in the MCU,  DC may be putting its best foot forward thus far with the first true blockbuster superheroine movie.  2017 may well be the year of the Wonder Woman.",0,0,Raven Stromdans,5lGoQhFb4NM,0.1820767195767196,2016-07-28 18:10:46,True,True

2016-07-29T14:35:20,"While this Trailer is outstanding in all respects (what it shows, what it does *not* show)  I do have one ongoing concern, and that is the wide apparent gap in WW's strength and toughness as displayed here versus what we saw in BvS.  The Comics generally state her strength and toughness as 2nd only to Superman, and in BvS that was certainly borne out, but here she seems to be at best a notch above Captain America.  The way I see it, her being able to take a hard hit from Doomsday that knocks her thru 1/2 a block of concrete and metal debris and bounce up smiling suggests that WWI-era gatlin guns and mortars should do little more than tickle, no need for a shield!  Hopefully, there is some progression or transformation in this film where she comes into her *full* powers.  Perhaps as a clay golem, given life by Zeus, her abilities have been ample for the challenges she has faced, and are enough to deal with all the trash mobs in the trenches.  But when she butts heads with the real villain in the movie (hopefully Ares), she might get beat down pretty bad initially.  Then it becomes a matter of does Zeus decide to boost her powers so as to be on a more even playfield with his brother?  Perhaps her bracers, which have at times been written as holding back her full powers, open up the throttle?  Or does her actions at stages in the movie warrant a more organic evolution?  Perhaps her clay Pinnochio gains real life in falling in love with Steve and with it her full potential is unlocked.  Or perhaps some other act of selflessness triggers that change (recall Thor getting his hammer and strength back after sacrificing himself to the Destroyer).    In any case, this movie really does need to, by the end, reflect the powerhouse that we saw in BvS.",28,9,Dagget Burmese,5lGoQhFb4NM,0.14938071188071192,2016-07-29 14:35:20,True,True

2016-07-30T03:09:41,In Somalia we have a very famous story one of the most femouse story in Somalia sometimes its said that its real. Its about a very beautiful queen called queen Arawelo she was well known for defying gender roles. She hated men so much that she and her female soldiers started hanging men by their testicles and killed baby boys when they were born. She wanted women to controll the land. Today men threw stones on her grave while women put flowers. The story was not written but was told in oral and men hided.

We see soldiers on the island, how did they get there? What if it turns out to be STEVE himself who betrays Diana or sells her out after making her fall in love with him? He crashed on Themyscira so he knows how to get there and tells those soldiers how to, and maybe someone in Diana¬¥s family dies in the battle with the soldiers so she gets exiled for insisting in helping Steve and returning him to wherever he was from and that¬¥s why she ends up walking away from man kind disgusted with humans but wasn¬¥t allowed to return to Themyscira.

2016-08-06T22:28:04,When I think of wonder woman My dick gets hard Gal does not do that for me. She is a fucking twig with no ass or tits just a pretty face that's it. In the fast and furious movie when she took off her bottom to show her bikini and they started playing the music i was like THERE'S NOTHING THERE how is this sexy......its not Her ass is a pancake. Why not cast an ifbb bikini model or Bridget Regan as wonder woman but they cast her.......really dc. Then superman dies in the second movie when they should have did brainac second and saved doomsday for the third movie. Doomsday looks nothing like the comics or animation and his origin is completely wrong and it should have been superman and doomsday one on one to the death. man of steel was the shit it was the perfect superman movie because its not superman saving louis and saving people but he fights in the movie and learns after he killed zod who he should be. then they cast a stick figure for wonder woman and make man of steel 2 a batman movie when batman is the sorriest excuse for a SUPERHERO of all time when there is nothing SUPER ABOUT HIM HES HUMAN DUMB ASSES. wonder WOMAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE FIT  AND BEAUTIFUL. I not saying she should has a giant ass and ddd cups size tits. She should be A size 4-5 with a tone body medium ass c cups for tits and tone thick legs Like Michelle lewin or Vida Guerra when she did ifbb training. This is just a sorry excuse for dc to beat marvel and it failed. If wonder woman fails at the box office then we know why BAD CASTING but it remains to be seen.

Their Culture is based on Greek Culture and probably has been speaking the same language as the former Greece. These amazons did not have any Contact with the outside World, since the Archaic time or maybe to early Middle Ages. So Britain was not formed, nor their language when the amazons lost Contact with the outside World.  The first thing Diana says to Steve Trevor is ""You're a man!"" in English.  Mayor flaw!!!!

Again, STORY is fine, execution is the improvement. Seriousness is fine, just keep it aligned with how serious the character behaves. Keep Superman the straight man, but let him smile more [I expect coming back from the dead and being a more respected hero after Doomsday is the logical, and seems to be intended direction.] But, and this is a big BUT. Wonder Woman is set in WWI. To shy away from the dark material would be a disservice. I only hope they offer levity in times when it often comes in reality, BETWEEN the action and life/death times, not DURING. And I also hope Johns and Berg keep execs not involved in creating these movies out of it.

2016-09-21T06:00:17,"Origin  Diana is the daughter of Queen Hippolyta, the first child born on Paradise Island in the three thousand year history that the immortal Amazons lived there. The Amazons had been created around 1200 B.C. when the Greek goddesses drew forth the souls of all women who had been murdered by men.   One soul was left behind, the one that would be born as Diana. That soul originally belonged to the unborn daughter of the first woman murdered by a man (whom Hippolyta was the reincarnation of).   In the late 20th Century, Hippolyta was instructed to mold some clay from the shores of Paradise Island into the form of a baby girl. Six members of the Greek Pantheon then bonded the soul to the clay, giving it life. Each of the six also granted Diana a gift: Demeter, great strength; Athena, wisdom and courage; Artemis, a hunter's heart and a communion with animals; Aphrodite, beauty and a loving heart; Hestia, sisterhood with fire; Hermes, speed and the power of flight.   Diana grew up surrounded by a legion of sisters and mothers. When she was a young woman, the gods decreed that the Amazons must send an emissary into Man's World. Queen Hippolyta ordered a contest to be held, but forbade Diana from participating. Diana disobeyed and did so anyway in disguise, easily winning the contest and being named the Amazon's champion. She was given a uniform fashioned from the standard of someone who had visited the island a few decades earlier",0,0,The Encrypted Afro,5lGoQhFb4NM,0.12343750000000002,2016-09-21 06:00:17,True,True

2016-09-22T19:18:38,"My Lord did they pick the best war for everyone's favorite warrior-princess to be thrown into. World War I (if they do it right should be called 'The Great War' in the film) is the most brutal war ever to have been fought. If this was Geoff Johns' doing, he saved the DCEU. Here you have all of these supposed comic book movie fans who really knows little-to-nothing about Wonder Woman saying ""Please, for the love of God why can't they just do World War II!?!"", but they don't have the sense in their heads to remember the LAST World War II superhero movie: Cap:The First Avenger, of course. Now that film is pretty solid, and a very good interpretation of the time period. I mean, you can say all you want about how Joe Johnston 'killed' Jurassic Park, and I'll say it with you, but man did he nail Cap in the old days, but what people don't realize is that if Wonder Woman were set in World War II, a lot of Marvel fanboys, including myself, would dismiss it as a rip-off of Cap 1. I hate to say it, but i would. I like the DCEU, I really do, and did I think Suicide Squad was pretty bad? Yes, of course I did. Batman v Superman? Not so much. That was a solid film, so was Man of Steel, but as for Marvel, they just have a longer track record of outstanding movies. You can't say that about DC. Sure they have the first two Superman films, the first Burton Batman, the Dark Knight trilogy, and Superman Returns. Besides the DCEU, that's about it. When you look back at DC films, you'll see a lot more shit than shine. I mean they made two Swamp Thing movies for goodness sake! And what about that God-awful Supergirl, and Superman III and Quest for Peace? Batman Returns was ok, and Batman Forever was meh, but Bat nipples truly takes the cake for bad movies. Green Lantern? Nope. How about Steel featuring Shaq? We just... don't speak of that. This has to be one of the best decisions DC has made so far, though. And Chris Pine's in it. How is that not awesome?

Even when she talks about men she's not derisive (how women's views on them are being recently portrayed), but still holds her ground in a respectful way and coming from a place of logic and common sense.
