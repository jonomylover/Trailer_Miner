A white American guy Owen Wilson is looking like a hero saving his family, firing guns and all (with the help of another white person, of former 007 fame), in a vaguely ""Asian"" conflict zone...  The exact country and the nature of a conflict are unimportant, fictitious even, they are just the backdrop for a white Westerner's heroic posturing, while the locals are merely zombies running amok with the only intent to kill. This works great in a Rambo movie, but Mr. Wilson is no Stallone. This basically looks like WWZ minus Brad Pitt. That is, the country is so unimportant, that if it weren't for the white guy being stranded there, the whole thing it wouldn't even be worth making a film about, even despite the apparently/supposedly violent conflict going on...    My reaction is that, for anyone who's been to Asia for any length of time, or even visited once, this sounds like a lazy exploitation movie targeting a rather dumb domestic audience who's never been abroad, - All the while pretending to be a realistic portrayal of a conflict (that's how the trailer conveys that at least). Based on this trailer, I wouldn't be seeing this film, and wouldn't advise spending your buck on this.   I am not against exploitation movies, when they don't pretend to be real. I don't mind Rambo - Rambo is Rambo and Stallone is Stallone, even if their stories are dumb, they're still fun.
