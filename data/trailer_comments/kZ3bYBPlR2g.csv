I can't say the same for the three witches though.   Oprah's face is too well known and her manner in this trailer was very much like the persona she often assumes in public i.e. dispenser of wisdom. I can't submerge Oprah and just see the character of the wise witch she is meant to be playing. The same for the glimpse we were shown of Reese Witherspoon - she just looked like an outlandishly dressed, stern looking version of herself. Now we all know that both of these ladies can act so this is either a failure of the director or a casting failure.

Meg is definitely not supposed to be black and I'm not racist in the slightest, but this is one of my favorite books and they ruined it. The comments all say that It just says Meg has brown hair and doesn't specify on race. Well, it specifically decribes her mother as having flaming red hair, creamy skin, and violet eyes. It says Charles Wallace is a tiny blonde haired boy. And even in the movie they made her father white. The book says Charles should be white which he is not in the trailer, and if nobody knows specifically what Meg should look like, well if her mother is white and red haired of all things and her dad is white, how on earth is Meg supposed to be black? And aside from that, it just looks dreadful anyway. And Zach Galifinakis as the happy medium??? I wish this was a joke. I'm tired of them making movies from books and completely butchering it. It reminds of the Vampire Academy movie they made from the books. I can't even watch it because the acting blows and it's just terrible, they definitely ruined that too. Go ahead and say I'm racist, but it has nothing to do with race. They like to fuck it up to try to make everyone happy and end up making it so far from the actual book that the people that have actually read it get angry. Fuck this movie and Oprah Winfrey. If Meg was supposed to be black and said so in the book, I wouldn't have cared. But they're changing the book to make others happy and it needs to stop. It's like the fiasco with Disney wanting to give live action Mulan a white cast. THAT made me irate, because it's literally set in China and that's what it was all about, so of course they should have all been Chinese, or at least of Asian descent. Who seriously cares?? I just want the movies to be made as close to the books as possible, but no. That won't happen.

That's not our world yet, but none of you seem to want us to become more comfortable having roles race-switched, even in scenarios where it's switched to white (which is something people have an issue with because of *context* btw).

(For instance, Jesus is presented as a ""good man"" but not the Son of God, along with several other equally ""good men"". Also, too much ""sameness"" is called an evil, though I think that's a personal preference, not an objective moral. I think it's laughable to hold ""Variety is the spice of life"" up to ""Thou shalt not kill"" or even ""Thou shalt not steal."")  I only read the first book of the series, though I very much enjoyed the read; it was very well written. However, I was in eighth or ninth grade at the time and solid in my Christian faith and doctrine, so it was easy for me to dismiss the theological/mythical aspects to the story as hogwash, but younger children might be confused or even influenced by the story.

The book is notable for its gravity and sense of place. The setting of the Murry homestead in rural New England forms a strong character of its own. That sense of place and reality, even in the fantastical settings, seems missing. The effects and cinematography seem more fitting for a Dr. Seuss, than a Madeleine L'Engle.

I think that if I had to explain color to a blind person, I would relate colors with touch or emotion. Yellow is the color of warmth, sunlight and happiness. White is the color of purity. Black is the color of fear and the unknown. Green is the color of life and prosperity.
