2017-12-04T08:13:48,"No hate but how is this movie similar to Everything, Everything? like yes they both feature a ""sick"" girl yet but for Everything, Everything the main story is about how the mum was lying about her illness whereas, for this movie the main girl actually has a illness and the main story is about how she is going to overcome it and how she's going to try to feel like a normal girl she even states it in the trailer: ""being more than just a disease"" which suggests that she wants to feel ""normal"" (she compromises with her illness as the sun harms her so she feels normal at night as she doesn't have to have this responsibility to take care herself from the sun) therefore, the only way we can actually tell if it's similar as a whole is by watching the movie. In my opinion, I don't see anything that's similar as it looks like two different story. Lastly, I feel like everyone who is hating on the actors should really not be so narrow minded as they're playing a character and so I don't think it's right to criticise their real lifestyle and should only care about the movie. And some facts for people criticising that the two movie is similar - Midnight Sun (2017) is actually adapted from a Japanese movie by the same name that has exact same storyline which was first released in 2006 and also has a Manga series whereas, the book for Everything, Everything was released in 2015 and the movie was released in 2017 more then a decade since the first Midnight Sun (2006) was released.

First off the lead girls have two DISTINCT illness which may sound similar but Katie Price’s disease is something that prohibits her from sunlight (she still can do whatever she wants except not stepping out on the sun, hence she goes out at MIDNIGHT) Madeline Whittier’s disease almost prohibits her from EVERYTHING hence being held captive inside her house her WHOLE LIFE (until she met Olly of course). Katie Price dies in the end while Madeline Whittier finds out she doesn’t have the disease after all. “Midnight Sun” is a remake of a Japanese movie while “Everything, Everything” was a novel written by Nicola Yoon. I can clearly perceive the difference between these two stories, which are quite good in their own ways.   I can’t believe many know-it-alls can generalise easily upon seeing a mere trailer and judging two different movies despite not being able to watch them to the entirety.",0,0,Noellah Jeannica 엔재이,WS-kCiCVEp0,0.21574074074074076,2018-05-04 01:08:18,False,True
