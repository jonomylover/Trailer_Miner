The doll hardly moved (besides rocking in a chair and floating in one scene) , and the movie is just full of shoots of the doll sitting on a shelf or in a chair, and the camera zooming in on it. The movie (plot wise) was essentially ""Oh shit the doll is back, whatever will we do?"" and the wife, with the skeptical husband, trying to protect her child from getting rekt by a creepy ass doll.   Oh, and don't even me started on the jumpscares. Just because your movie is full of scenes of doll close ups, and filler doesn't mean that jumpscares will make the movie scary or atleast, any less terrible.  I don't have high hopes for this Annabelle either. I'm assuming that there, of course, will be more doll close up, and more jumpscares to distract you from the lack of plot.

Once Annabelle started haunting them they called Ed and Lorraine Warren and they locked it up in their house along with other haunted items that they investigated. But no one truly knows what exactly happened to the doll or why a demon has manifested itself onto the doll, these movies are just ideas and made up stories about what could have happened to the doll.

2017-07-09T03:27:24,"Ridiculous, all of you. Facts:  1) I was born in 1970 (the same year the doll was given as a gift‚Äìallegedly). Shortly after birth, I was given the Raggedy Ann doll.  2) My mom knew I had an aversion to dolls, so she discretely ‚Äúgod rid‚Äù of it.  3) ‚ÄúThe Exorcist‚Äù was released in 1973, but I didn‚Äôt see it until years later. When I did, I imagined Linda Blair‚Äôs face was on my bedroom door every night.  4) When I was 19, I became friends with a European model who lived next door to Linda Blair. Because her role in ‚ÄúThe Exorcist‚Äù was a career killer, she isolated herself; and, shall I say, continued a slow, painful death.  5) In my 30s, my grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs. Every day she‚Äôd talk about how the dolls in her living room were possessed by demons that tormented her.  6) After she passed away, ‚ÄúThe Conjuring‚Äù came out. So did my mom when she outed my grandma for being the one to gift me with Raggedy Ann as a baby. I was pissed.  7) I made a voodoo doll as part of an art project. Because this was something I had so much experience with, I wasn‚Äôt surprised at all when the lights went out right as I pushed the first pin into its head.  8) Oh, so many things we don‚Äôt have time for.  9) There are so many faults with the ‚Äúreal‚Äù story inherently, I don‚Äôt even need to waste my time with this.  10) There are, however, sentiments I‚Äôm just dying to get out of my mind to our devolving culture.  Sentiments:  1) Science is clearly fallible. I mean, I‚Äôm pretty sure forensics was a thing even in the ‚Äò70s.  2) Religion is debatable. Being rational, however, I find the Bible to be the biggest piece of propaganda ever used in the Western hemisphere..and beyond.  3) The next biggest piece of propaganda now is Annabelle.  4) The Warrens are, or were, frauds by all accounts worth mentioning. So are manipulated photos and film, BTW. Duh.  5) I don‚Äôt know where my ‚ÄúRaggedy Ann‚Äù went; but the farther, the better.  That thing was FIDEOUS (f-ing hideous).  Oh, and a #666 to end this) Demonic possession is what idiots believe is present because they don‚Äôt possess enough brains to logically explain otherwise. That is, for example, possibly explained by psychosocial disorder, personality disorder, hysteria, toxicity, stages of physical disease, Christianity, hanging crucifixes on the walls, sleep disorders, etc. ad nauseam. Any of these and more can cause a person‚Äôs ‚Äúaffliction‚Äù by them grasping for religious straws and the subsequent physical and psychological manifestations, which become social widely by mediums such as these movies. If you believe in this crap, you are vastly contributing to the devolution of society.  You must have actually voted for President.

They're not supposed to be scary, they're supposed to catch you off guard and keep you on the edge. That's literally it. Think of a horror movie like a roller coaster. Would you prefer a coaster that just goes straight in a line like a subway or one that goes up and down and upside down. Take 0:58 for example. The scene starts out with a jump scare, but then the scary part comes AFTER when Annabel starts attacking the girl. Jumpscares are presents.

This demon form is very uncreative since Insidious demon's look exactly like that. And why do they think demons look like red people? Lol. And when I saw it at the theater even the ignorant nun who is so called ""Christian"" does not believe in demons or whatever, she had so many doubts between the girl with the broken leg, it's ridiculous, and that chair sitting moment which they had to confess their sins was ridiculous to, she should have been concerned or ask questions, that nun does not know what she's doing. And when they got at the barn scene or whatever the scene and area looked really fake and I just laughed very hard about how many boring jump scares there were. And They should have put more into detail about the doll how they let the demon inside it was boring scripting and nothing detailed. Just generic horror flick that get's norms and idiots to like it and say ""This is the best horror film that was ever created"". When you make horror movies you don't go stereotype or generic when it comes to Christianity, I swear all of these horror movies have no clue, and the teenagers are clueless of what's going on. What point are you guys even trying to make about us teenagers? I'm 19 soon twenty next year in June, you think I don't know that demons are not real? I know plenty since I'm brought up and have understand as a Christian, I know all of these things are true. It's just hilarious man, tired of this bull crap I see in EVERY HORROR MOVIE EVEN IF IT'S OLD IT'S STILL BS.  Every character is very ignorant the main characters there's only one character who is not but they have a weak death and unnecessary one that goes away into full details of the movie. If they kept the character who was the guy who owned the house, the movie would have a different approach. And why have to use the girl with the wheel chair and why at the beginning they have to all have dolls? Let the audience think for once about what's going on, challenge them for peace sake.

2017-11-17T19:11:47,"Unoriginal piece of garbage. The movie does not develop its characters, the characters make the stupidest decisions and the jump scares are back to back (for about an hour and 30 min). Jump scares are predictable and clearly ""inspired""/stolen from other movies (for example the vomit possession from Evil Dead). Couldn't finish the movie in the end as there was no compelling story (got to about 1,5 hours) or character development. Good way to check if there is any character development is asking your self mid-movie: Would i care if all the characters died right now? If the answer is no, quit watching.   What saddens me is that this movie is making so much money in box office, which in turn will result in more of this regurgitated garbage getting released. Shimmer of hope this year are movies like ""Get out"": good acting, great story and clever scares. If you don't care for story or character development but enjoy countless unoriginal back-to-back jump scares definitely go see this movie.",1,1,kaskraker,KisPhy7T__Q,0.08463718820861679,2017-11-17 19:11:47,False,False

That makes no sense to me, if she was adopted, her legal name would still be Janice so it makes no sense that her name to suddenly become ""Annabelle""-  that was a lousy attempt at trying to be clever and connect Annabelle to the Conjuring. A prequel was a dumb idea in the first place, I think a sequel to the opening of the Conjuring would've been far superior! I guess that's what they're gonna do in Annabelle: The Sequel (Pt. 3). Maybe they did this to end on a cliff hanger and set up for a pt. 3. But ala, this movie was very confusing, from the beginning I was thinking ""now why would the director have the name of the foster family's daughter be Annabelle? Is he ignoring the beginning of the Conjuring?"". It was entertaining, just confusing. 5/10 and overrated. I feel like the reason this movie and IT are doing strong at the box office, is not because these were good movies, but because audiences are attempting to send a message to Hollywood that they want R-rated horror. I value gore and R rating too, but the output hasn't been well seeing as both IT and Annabelle are extremely overrated. Next will be an overrated Conjuring 3. Oh, and I don't see how Annabelle or IT got a f***** R-rating in the first as there was little gore but more of a focus on jump scares. I guess rated R for run for cover from the jump scares. /rant. :-)",1,3,jam,KisPhy7T__Q,0.11112499999999999,2017-12-03 08:02:06,False,False
