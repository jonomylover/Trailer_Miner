Was my teacher wrong in school!﻿ I'm sorry for the rambling, but I'm just perplexed at the movie industry juicing everything that's good in the first setting then not coming up with original scripts. Don't forget us moviegoers falling for the okiedook. SMH﻿ it's not like its The Lord of the Rings where it's a Trilogy.

He had the chance to escape while he was in the RV. There was no point of bringing Kim with him. Was she used as leverage? I don't know. In fact, it became a disadvantage for him. He could have just ran away with the money and leave LA on an airplane. Abducting Kim just made Bryan chase after him that led to his downfall. Bryan might have just leave him for the meantime once bryan knew that Kim was safe. Then this was Stuart's supposed choice so he could just disappear and keep himself safe.

Preposterous plot with holes you could drive a bus through...the main one being that it becomes clear very early on that the whole escape and evasion of Liam Neeson was unnecessary. The attempt to frame him was absolutely terrible and he would have been cleared in days and the evidence that proved who did do it would have been found quickly and easily by the police, no clever police work required.  Utterly lazy of the film makers and writers to come up with such a pointless mission for him. He ends up destroying property, assaulting police officers, killing people, and almost certainly injuring civilians to find out nothing that wouldn't have been discovered quickly anyway.
