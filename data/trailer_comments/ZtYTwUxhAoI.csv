The trailer alone is well done and it found a masterful way of catering to the modern impatience and ‚Äúlet me see the good parts‚Äù of today‚Äôs trailers while seeming like it will hold true itself. I‚Äôm not saying the movie will be good, but this trailer is  refreshing. It found a way to be a lot like every trailer we get now, yet still has an audacity to actually make you expect/want more. It was exiting and yet vague...    It initially had a rush of a thriller...then you got a taste of that suspense...then it stated ‚Äúhey I am a horror comedy‚Äù  then it reverted back to its thriller tones and finally have premise as to how it is a horror... finally having me expect it to be a comedy horror.

I‚Äôm not overly excited to see this movie but I am something more simple and yet in many ways better....I am interested.

2019-06-21T05:14:54,"Considering how many females are killed in the preview, I will be willing to bet that the ""ritual"" that they perform in what seems to be near he end of the movie, will bring all of them back to life. If they were being killed permanently, the writer would have made all the maids butlers instead. When the characters are actually killed like that, the writers make them males 99% of the time. That's the only way the vast majority of writers know how to write those parts. Not to mention that, in the ""family"" they show more females than males. That almost NEVER happens. Somehow, all the characters that are shown killed will be healed or they are vampires or some such.

2019-08-25T03:53:54,"Is this generation so apathetic that it needs to have the same plotline repeated in less than a year or are young film makers so wrapped up in themselves that they don't pay attention to their peers? I just watched this plot play out for free on Amazon Prime under the title ""The Chicken Party"" that was released in 2018! The only differences being a complete lack of adult participation and the story being centered around cannibalistic rich kids who prey on awkward foreign, ""mid stage"" millennials who have language barriers.   Otherwise, same set-up, same game, same no name ensemble cast trying to get noticed (and from what I saw in this trailer, doing a better job at it than what is on display here. It even has the same gimmick of creating ambiguity over the possible motives of one of the captors.  It is also framed as an unwinnable contest.  As one remake of older horror movies after another  disappoints newer  audiences perhaps it's time to stop asking which new movie is going to prey on your naivete and start asking Why you make such an easy target. See how that theme ties in with this movie's message? There is a whole world of great movies that were made before you you were born. This movie, for example example is just another version of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" from that was first translated from book to film in 1932 and again in 1965 as ""The Naked Prey"" where, once the game began the person in peril had no snappy dialogue. In fact his survival relied on his ability to not even make a sound. That was what created the suspense (so ""A Quiet Place"" was not nearly as original as many thought... just outside of their awareness.)  In closing I offer anyone interested a wee bit of advice... If you want to save money in the short run, watch ""The Chicken Party"" for free on Amazon Prime and wait for this movie to hit the streaming services if you really want to make a comparison. However, for those of you who want to save money in the long run and force movie makers from treating your lack of experience as something to be exploited it's time you expanded your awareness to more than watching the fresh faces you recognize from The WB network falling into the roles of middle aged mothers with empty nest syndrome or In-Law anxiety. Horror movies have long been known as the birth place for young actors and the cemetary in which they wait for their career to finally catch up with their loss of looks and popularity.  The theme on display in all of the titles mentioned here is that of the Rich feeding off of the Poor (which is why it seems to be popping up so often) and you don't have to go too far back to see this being played out in hilariously gory detail as Brian Yuzna's 1989 camp classic ""Society"" is also included free on Amazon Prime at the time of this writing.",0,0,Dunkage,ZtYTwUxhAoI,0.0407695374800638,2019-08-25 03:53:54,False,True
