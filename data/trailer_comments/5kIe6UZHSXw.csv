Why couldn't they use the power ranger series 1 theme tune? It would have been so epic. I also really dislike the liberties they have taken with certain designs like Zordon and Alpha. And why make Rita sexy and scantly clad? It makes no sense.  All I'm saying is, the people who make these movie shouldn't try to rewrite history if they want to make movies like this because the people who go to see them are the people who grew up with the source material.

I think if they bring the cringe and shoddy stuff done in the originals back and their goal is to recreate that kind of charm, then based on the trailers it just might work.

2017-01-19T17:38:57,"EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THE POWER RANGERS TRAILER A Cinema Sins rip-off  1. 0:00 - 0:04 Footage near the end of the trailer is at the beginning, signifying either an inaccurate circle of life theme or shitty editing. Given Hollywood's perception of the general movie going audience, I'm inclined toward the latter. +1  2. 0:06 The stop sign is too close to, and in full view of, the stop sign indicator, negating the yellow sign's purpose. +1  3. 0:08 - 0:10 Then what brought you together? Detention?  +1  Also, if you're merely acquaintances, then why are you ready to fuck around in a restricted area together? +1  ¬†4. 0:11 - 0:13 Character telling other characters what they already know merely to inform the audience clich√©. +1  5. 0:14 - 0:20 Not somehow. You broke into a restricted area together. +1  6. 0:24 - 0:27 That's not glowing; that's peeing in the pool. +1  Also, are they assigned their ranger colors by the coins they carry? Because this scene makes it look like it's by the color of their topmost outer garment. +1  7. 0:36 If she breaks her phone in this scene, then why does she ask the black guy how strong he is in the previous trailer? Scenes don't match up. Even if this scene takes place later on in the movie, it still doesn't work because they got their coins at the same time and should therefore be experiencing puberty--I-I mean their powers simultaneously. +1  8. 0:38 Thank you Captain Obvious. Your contribution is unquestionably beneficial. +1  9. 0:42 - 0:43 Angle of attack differs from angle of impact. +1  10. 0:51 Zordon is the PG-13 version of Pinhead. +1  11. 0:53 - 0:55 Obvious dialogue jump is obvious. +1  12. 0:56 - 0:57 No, you're talking to someone through a communicative device. +1  13. 0:57 - 0:59 So was I of your design. Who signed off on that thing? H. P. Lovecraft?  +1  14. 1:02 Where exactly is Angel Grove located? First it's a suburban area and now it's a mountainous region with a fishing community. +1  Also, If it's _not_ a fishing community, then this is a wealthy area whose residents love to go boating, which is hypocritical to the ""weirdos and criminals"" line from the previous trailer. +1  15. 1:04 - 1:10 Cute line, but there's no way she would actually say this to anyone in ear shot who hasn't experienced it, as they wouldn't believe her.  1:11 - 1:12 See? Now she's going to have to get a psychiatric evaluation and be watched like a hawk by her parents, thus preventing her from ever becoming a Power Ranger. +1  Also, WHOA! How did her mom happen to have a urinalysis cup on hand? Now I want to know what kind of drugs what's-her-name has taken before! Can we get a prequel to see her life of sex, drug abuse, and addiction? +1  16. 1:16 Trying to bring sweatbands back. +1  17. 1:17 - 1:19 Why? Just because they found the power coins? That's pretty shady. +1  18. 1:25 - 1:26 I've seen enough trailers to know that her laugh has nothing to do with that moment in the scene, which means we are once again being instructed on when to laugh because advertisers believe the audience is too stupid to recognize humor when they see it. +1  19. 1:28 - 1:30 How do _you_ know? Is there a prophesy? Please tell me there's no prophesy! +1  20. 1:31 - 1:33 Then do it already! +1  21. 1:33 - 1:34 How are the Power Rangers being knocked off of their feet? You'd think that, with their newfound strength,  they would be able to maintain their balance during a tiny Earth-shattering impact like that. +1  22. 1:36 - 1:38 Damn it, Zordon! Why did you bring an abstract idea into an action movie when you know full well that the philosophical discussions of if evil truly exists since it's an abstract idea, what the baseline ideas are of what defines evil, and what requirements need to be met in order to define someone as evil--never mind pure evil--are never going to take place? +1  In fact, I'm going to go ahead and throw in an extra sin. I'm calling it right now: Rita's backstory will either be insufficient or never support her pure evilness status. +1  23. 1:40 - 1:41 Remember how Rita said that she had killed rangers before in the previous trailer? I'll bet she didn't accomplish it like this. +1  24. 1:41 - 1:43 I don't know. With those powers you have now? +1  Alternatively, she seems to have taken a shining to you, as you're the only ranger she's prominently faced in the trailers so far. Why don't you try seducing her? I'd watch that! +1  25. 1:51 - 1:52 Group walking slowly and in line clich√©. At least there's no explosion behind them, but the clich√© still stands. +1  26. 1:53 Synchronous landing. +1  27. 2:01 - 2:02 How do _you_ know? Is there a prophesy? Please tell me there's no prophesy! +1  Also, protagonist saves loved one from danger clich√©. +1  28. 2:10 - 2:11 Damn it, Zordon! Why did you bring an abstract idea into an action movie when you know full well that the philosophical discussions of if time truly exists since it's an abstract idea, if it can be possessed or owned, who can possess or own it, and should it ever be possessed or owned are never going to take place? +1  29. 2:16 Why do they have their faces exposed while in the zords? That is tactically weak. +1  SIN TALLY: 36 SENTENCE: 10,000 imprisoned in a trash can  1:32 - 1:33 You're a fool, Harry Potter, and you will lose everything. 1:33 - 1:34 She's going to do the superhero landing!

Reshoots, added or removed scenes, more time to perfect the special effects, and other marketing efforts. As for the Rangers, I personally saw much better interaction this time around compared to the 1st trailer. Not too happy with Alpha's design, and I wish they'd enhanced Zordon's voice to give it more ethereal, alienistic quality. Goldar's design doesnt look very original or amazing, and I wonder if he will retain any of his personality from the original show. Finally, I actually don't mind the Rangers having super powers, as I believe Dino Thunder actually did this with their Rangers (and fun tie in: Tommy, the original green ranger- and later on, gold ranger and red ranger- was in that season).

But this looks pretty good, at the very least if it isn't it's probably just going to be decent and still entertaining as heck.   And correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the Power Rangers generally a franchise that's campy and fun. There's story there for sure, but it's not like it's masterpiece. All the older fans of the franchise really just like it because it's what they grew up with. It's nostalgia. So if this film doesn't reliever acting wise or even story wise... it's not that big of a deal. Similar to how TMNT Out of the Shadows' film was contrived and ridiculous but for being a film based largely on the original 80s show, that was fine.

The fact that Rita appears in the Yellow Ranger's home shows that the Villains know the Rangers' true identities, providing an actual serious threat compared to the bumbling idiotic Rita in the original TV show. 3. All design complaints about the Zords aside, they are shown to fire actual ammunition compared to the typical 90s fantasy lasers in the original series. Again, bonus points for reality based weaponry. 4. Those Putties actually look like they are made out of rocks this time. 5. A bit of actual Zord piloting is shown to be done by the Rangers compared to the lazy ""voice command"" piloting style of the original Rangers.

You can modernize without changing it too dramatically. I do not mind the new powers they have. Lets face it, they fought on without their suits in the show and would still whoop ass. It made no sense. Puddies is a great twist having being made up of rocks and soil. Just please do not fuck up the green ranger storyline for the sequel! I bet that is where you are going, but Tommy is too revered as a character to shit on. Just dont skip over him being evil too or passing him up for the white ranger. The green with evil storyline could be a great movie! I get the feeling though that is why Rita now wears green instead of brown. She had the power coin first and the dragonzord when she gave it to Tommy during season 1. Its rumored that the origin of her is that she was the original green ranger on another planet and that Zordon was either the force he is now or was a ""human"" being and apart of the same ranger team. I hope this movie pans out so we can see a green with evil storyline and then a 3rd movie with lord zedd.

And in all reality, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are an alternation of the Super Sentai, the ORIGINAL series. Power Rangers is basically the Americanized version of it, because it's a live action show and dubbing is for animation. In all of the scenes where you see characters in the flesh, that's the reenactment, in the scenes where they're in their transformed states, it's dubbed to the suitable audience. That's my theory, at least. But back on topic, to those complaining that this movie will 'ruin their childhood', you don't have to count this movie as canon, as the original Power Rangers is basically a different continuity than the source material.

2017-01-20T09:01:40,"‚ÄúMen always say that as the defining compliment, don‚Äôt they? She‚Äôs a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she‚Äôs hosting the world‚Äôs biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don‚Äôt mind, I‚Äôm the Cool Girl.  Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they‚Äôre fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men ‚Äì friends, coworkers, strangers ‚Äì giddy over these awful pretender women, and I‚Äôd want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who‚Äôd like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I‚Äôd want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn‚Äôt really love chili dogs that much ‚Äì no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They‚Äôre not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they‚Äôre pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you‚Äôre not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn‚Äôt want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version ‚Äì maybe he‚Äôs a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he‚Äôs a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn‚Äôt ever complain. (How do you know you‚Äôre not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: ‚ÄúI like strong women.‚Äù If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because ‚ÄúI like strong women‚Äù is code for ‚ÄúI hate strong women.‚Äù)‚Äù",0,1,froot loops,5kIe6UZHSXw,0.12489711934156379,2017-01-20 09:01:40,True,True

They made the suits look sleek and ""modern"" instead of keeping their iconic bulky look, and the Zords look like Transformers rejects.  The voice for Zordon sucks, too.

I'm upset because last trailer was fine, it showed enough, I knew that if they made another trailer they were going to show everything....and sure enough they did. Why!?, I've lost the build up to watch this movie, they act like we were going to watch this for the story. In just tired all the movies in hollywood are doing this now. Watch a trailer from the 70s or 80s, very short trailers that would leave some hype for the imagination.

But then they showed the power rangers part and everyone one I was with agreed that the movie looked cool but why did it have to be labeled power rangers. The name is just associated with crapy special effects and little kids. But with this movie they seem to be targeting older people (13-45ish)as their audience. Its contradicting itself.

Here's my theory on how the rest will play out:  Tommy will be the Green Ranger to be Rita's sucessor to try to destroy the Rangers, but when he's turned good, Rita will do everything to strip the ranger powers from Tommy. Difference from TV: Rita actually succeeds. And then Rita gets defeated again and lays low.  Then... Enter Zedd more powerful than Rita. So powerful that Zordon will need the help of 5 new Rangers.  Now if I may make a prediction: they will do the transition for Tommy going from green to white but for the other 4 to join it will be something like this:  Rocky: Gold Adam: Gray or Silver Aisha: Orange Katherine: Purple  the new Rangers will have ninja zords.  So these 10 Rangers fight Zedd and nearly destroys him but Rita saves Zedd and form up.  And finally in a climatic finale Rita and Zedd destroys the zords but upon the Rangers' spirit from within their zords become super with the orig 5  going from Dino to Thunder and the other 5 going from Ninja to Shogun. They were finally able to destroy them, life is good, it goes on and it's back to normal again, except for the Rangers who will always be on alert for the next evil.",0,0,Lemont Johnson,5kIe6UZHSXw,0.10024242424242422,2017-01-24 07:47:17,True,True

2017-01-27T18:18:46,"this movie is gonna be awesome, now before any of you haters start attacking me hear me out. 1. yes this movie's taking itself to a darker tone than the show, but the show was cheezy and silly, think of batman at first he was the silliest and cheeziest superhero anyone ever knew, well what happened? he grew dark and now he's one of the greatest superheroes of all time. 2. the suits actually look impressive, the spandex suits just wouldn't work for this darker toned power rangers, and besides what good is spandex gonna do against knives and bullets? if they do get into a knife and gunfight anyway. 3. most of the movie's designs look pretty cool, and I'll be honest here I really don't like alpha 5's design he looks like crap. OK but seeing them in motion is a bigger difference than seeing them in a picture or poster. 4. all the characters so far seem to be really likable. 5. yes it's an unknown cast, but not all the cast is unknown and they really seem to care for the project and had lots of fun doing it. that's all I had to say.",4,4,Karl Loustalot,5kIe6UZHSXw,0.2636363636363636,2017-01-27 18:18:46,True,True

I mean WHERE in the history of great warriors in this world was this ever a thing. And I only mean the 5 man or 6 man teams where each color is symbolic of your personality. I get the concept was designed for children to help differentiate each character, but this is 2017. Maybe the red ranger or the alpha of the team, is actually female. The pink ranger could have been a dude, or maybe a gay ranger in the mix. What color is the gay ranger? Depends what shoes he's wearing. And you know whoever's not in red or blue is usually the funny one also known as the least favorite of the bunch. Why cant the clown be the alpha? Cause that's not funny. This assorted arrangement was meant for comic books, but today it's stereotyping in technicolor. I know some of you grew up with this thing, as did I, but to a kid with a group of friends, out on Halloween...who gets to wear the cool blue and red costumes? and who gets stuck with yellow or green or purple? Who wants to be THAT guy???. Of course they were very careful with the casting in this movie. God forbid the black ranger be a black guy, or the yellow ranger be the asian guy, but it's ok to make the yellow and pink ranger both female, cause those are girl colors, so they have to be. But no way can the blue and red rangers be both white and the black guy be left with the suckiest color, so let's make a black ranger so that whoever gets that costume wont look like the Donatello/jar jar binks of the bunch! ....  ...dont mind me I just need some coffee...",0,0,wildevil,5kIe6UZHSXw,0.04256097560975609,2017-02-01 16:09:05,True,True

Also this is so unfaithful to the original that they didnt even bother to throw in Paul Shrier or Jason Narvy even as a cameo.

I don't know why but part of the charm of the power rangers suits was the black glass openings whatever you call which gave a cool design and to know that anyone can behind the suit so they'd never know your identity. This seems to be the same problem in other movies with more emphasis on the actor such as mystique in x men where nowadays you just see Jennifer Lawrence with little blue skin moments or in the spectacular Spider-Man movies where we see Andrew Garfield's face even when he's wearing his costume.

2017-03-26T03:26:53,"I had doubts about this movie when it first announced, and now I see why my gut had doubts. The first bad thing they did was give a release date with absolutely nothing to back it behind. Seriously, even Michael Bay wouldn't do something that stupid. The second stupid thing they did was hire Zack Stentz and Ashley Miller, the two writing hacks behind the Transformers and Star Trek films. I honestly think these two don't even bother researching the source material for the films they make, instead they just shit out whatever they come with. Because of them, the movie took WAY too many liberties to where the personalities of the characters don't match the real Power Ranger characters, nor does it match the real Power Rangers origin story. Yes, I can accept SOME changes to a new adaptation (I did that with the Chris Nolan Batman trilogy), but I can't accept characters who do something out of character. You've never seen Jason pranking a rival high school team then have the cops come after him, you've never seen any of the other rangers be portrayed as angsty (or ""screw ups"" as they call themselves), and you've never heard Zordon tell the rangers they're unworthy to be Power Rangers. FYI, I have nothing against the cast, because they can only work with what they're given, and that's not their fault. However, they could research the character they were portraying to help get into character. The next stupid thing they did was hire Dean Israelite as the director, even though most of his films are half-assed, because they often get 5 or 6 out of 10 stars (look up his directing credits on IMDB).  I'll admit I was excited to see this movie after watching this trailer, because it changed my views on if it would be good or not. It made me think that this would be not only a fresh take, but a good take, on the franchise. Now all of that excitement went down the shitter after seeing this piece of shit all of the way through on opening night. I walked out of that theater feeling insulted, and was shocked to realize what I saw was not a Power Rangers movie. Ever since I got home that night, and up until now, I've been getting my thoughts down on paper for a fan-film reboot as a way to make up for this film. I shouldn't have to reboot this ""reboot"", but no, Shat Stentz and Ass-ley Miller made me feel a need to do this, because like the typical leeches that they are, they clearly don't respect franchises like this one. And just so you're aware, this fan-film will have some changes as well, but it will still relate itself to the source material at the same time.",0,0,DrDK144,5kIe6UZHSXw,-0.014298540965207635,2017-03-26 03:26:53,False,True

We don't see the ""Power Rangers"" till the climax and even then they only have one fight scene before they got in their Zords and I didn't really like Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa. A little weird in her talking and was kinda over the top but not in the fun way likemthe original Rita. The Rangers themselves were likable though some more than others. Billy, Jason & Kimberly were the best. Zack was OK (felt sorry for him with what he was going through) and Trini was OK though they weren't as interesting as the others. I liked this movie enough to actually want a sequel. Mostly because I want to see more fight scenes in their suits.

It just looked so AWEFUL. The costumes and make-up for the villains were laughably cheap, the acting was WAY over the top (especially for the villains), the dialogue was cheesy beyond belief, and the girl rangers actually wore SKIRTS! When was the last time that you¬†saw a female soldier wearing a skirt into combat? It was like watching an extremely low budget 1950s/early 1960s Godzilla movie crossed with Plan 9 From Outer Space. Which isn't to say that it couldn't have been great as an animated show. Needless to say, I never watched the series; but this movie actually looks really good! I've heard a lot of really good reviews about it; and they say that about the first 2/3rds of it¬†consist of really good¬†character-development. Well, except for the part about one of the male Rangers briefly accidentally giving a bull a hand-job (apparently, he couldn't tell a male from a female).

2017-04-25T06:23:30,"REVIEW, NO SPOILERS.  This movie was good at first, it wasn't as cliche as I thought it would be at the start.  I mean, sure, you kinda have your cliche school children 'group', but that's what the original power rangers was like.   Aside from the start - it became almost too predictable, oh, this is about to happen? Well, I know what'll happen next. It was literally like that, it was comedy more than anything. You're also dealing with too much cheesy story line, sure, the actors were okay with this type of movie but the story line was the huge problem.  It was like watching Dora asking you where the most obvious thing is, yeah, it's that painful.   I do believe they aimed this at the wrong audience, felt like for kids, but not for kids(?) I don't know what that's all about, the ""Billy"" of the group fitted in perfectly, and he was probably my favourite character of them all, because he fit in his role well and he did a good job with it.  I'd give this movie a 4/10 and that's at a stretch, I would've gotten my money back if I could, obviously point of views are a thing w/ opinions, so don't take my word for it, look at other reviews and check out some clips to note your decision down compared to mine.

2017-05-16T01:13:39,"Okay so before you watch this, there are some issues. This won't contain spoilers. First of all Power Rangers 2017 is nothing like gen 1 90's PR. This is actually a good thing, means it isn't super cheesy. Other good things include the fact that the baddies no longer double as comic relief. It's also a good movie which doesn't milk the past too much.   Now the bad, and rising above all else is the fact that the rangers don't morph until the final 30 mins of the movie, which is just too late. There is little time, so we see 30 secs of fighting in armour before we jump straight to the zords. Speaking of the zords, the sped up final battle is so hectic that we don't really get time to see the zords. Really hoping there'll be a sequel, because if not then there's just too little ranger time in a movie supposedly made for fans.   There is also the matter of American PC. Trini, the yellow ranger, can no longer be Asian, and the black ranger Zach cannot be black. Billy is now black, but still has the nerdy personality of white Billy cause we can't have a dancing and hip hop loving black ranger.   I couldn't care less about the race changes, I'd be perfectly happy with a Samoan Jason as long as he played the part of Jason.....

Nice acting, good cinematography, character development was interesting, the one thing I did have an issue with was that the Megazord looked almost exactly like Optimus Prime from the Bay Transformers movies. I think they should have tried to be a little more accurate with the source material as far as the design of the Megazord. I really liked the suits in action. I had to get used to them, but I really liked them in the end. The one thing I have to have for the sequel is to have Tommy's character be done properly, and his suit better have the gold chest armor. Rita in the suit looked cool, but I didn't see that gold armor which scares me for Tommy not having it when he becomes the new green ranger. Please don't leave that out. This is a must.

Only spoiler I'll share is a moment where Red Ranger talks with Zordon, and Zordon tells him that he's the leader. When Red catches up with the other Rangers he says something along the lines of ""You guys actually waited, especially you?"", looking at Yellow ranger who liked to run off and be by herself. That is the only line that comes out of his mouth. A few lines later Yellow ranger says to him, ""Why are you speaking to us like you're the boss now?"". I literally lost my shit. He said NOTHING to make them assume that he was the leader or being bossy, he only had that one line!!! Like who tf edited and wrote this fucking movie?!!!

I loved every minute of it and even found little things sad that normally I wouldnt have done in films. Thats because of the emotional connections we have to the programmes. The opening scene sucked me in straight away with the yellow ranger and Zordon dying. I loved learning about these characters and their stories. We never got to see this side in the programmes.. they were just school kids and that's all we knew. Loved that they made us wait untill near the end of the film before they morphed to show the togetherness they had to have. That's what made the morphing scene so good.. ""It's morphing time"" - Love when Jason said that. Could have had more passion though üòÇ.  They connected the film to our day and age with an autistic character, bi / gay (?) character and someone that looks after his mum. Also showed Kimberly talking about the issues these days with people sending indecent pictures of themselves and Jason showed if you try hard there's always something else you can be good at going the american football to leading the Rangers. The ratings it received were way too harsh. Too much action and it would have been just a kids film. They made it for us.
