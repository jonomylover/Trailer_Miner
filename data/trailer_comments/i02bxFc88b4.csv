Perhaps this girl helps him find his humanity, or at least reminds him of his daughter. So he becomes protective/responsible for her since now the people he is working for (Brolin of the DOJ)  wants to kill her.

But that plan backfires when the federal police attack them. No-one wanted to bring her back to the U.S., but they didn't want her to die before the cartel war started. When the Secretary cut the cord on the operation the official order is to kill the girl before she can reveal some information that might incriminate the U.S., but Alejandro feels sorry for her and tries to help her. Graver honors his friends dying wish. The idea was by posing as DEA agents they can pretend that another cartel had kidnapped Rejes's daughter and the DEA returned her to mexico. Where presuambly she would be killed and this would spark the war between the cartels.  Also with all the fancy intel and logistics, the U.S. didn't have anyone in the Mexican police force to let them know that they were under Reyes' payroll?    The whole point is that Mexico wouldn't have known who killed those policemen that's why Alessendro and the girl needed to be killed they were they only people that could place the US personnel to the scene.
