2017-03-10T03:24:23,"Since each movie has to be ""bigger"" then the previous one, here is the main idea for F9:   The Rock becomes a zombie that will lead an army of alien that come from Mars, so Dom has to fight alongside with his crew again to save the earth (because they are the only ones skilled enough to drive on Mars!). They get back to their garage and start adapting their sponsored cars (insert product placement here) with rockets and giant fuel tanks in the middle of a bunch of ladys in bikinis and rap music.   They put their plan in action! But before they reach the launch pad they are chased by zombie martians from hell and have to fight for it (insert tons of explosions) they barely win the battle and before they launch into space Dom says ""this is for the family"" (check!) they go into space where they fight more zombie martians with laser weapons, but the tech guy, after babbling some random computer mambo jambo (because science) manages to do some code virus thingy and disables their zombie laser weapon stuff, Dom accelerates and smashes into Mars and goes directly to the planet core where he has to plant a nuclear hip hop bomb, but before that he has to fight The Zombie Rock (c)! They fight! Explosions! Excitement! Zombies!   Dom almost looses to The Zombie Rock (c), but in the last second The Zombie Rock (c) has flashbacks from the other movies in a really nicely edited footage and thinks how good the franchise used to be and stops, looks into Doms eyes and says ""I miss you brother, go, i¬¥ll detonate the bomb and destroy the planet"" *sad music* Dom cries ""No, I want to die with you! Like family!"" (check!), but The Zombie Rock (c) says ""no, you have to take care of your sister and your nephews, remember Brian, he woulnd¬¥t like you to die in Mars with zombies"" Dom cries more and does that cheesy look that Vin Diesel always does ""goodbye brother... "" *cheesy sad music with some rapper singing rapper things like bitches and money and how he¬¥s better than you*  All the other secondary actors are already out of the planet waiting for Dom, the planet explodes! Letty screams ""Dommmmmm!!!!!"" Roman says something Roman would say that is completely irrelevant to the scene ""oh man... no way man... I ain¬¥t sign up for this man, can¬¥t be man..."" That other guy that pretends he understands tech stuff and computers shakes his head in disbelief. But... Here comes Dom flying in his rocket space muscle car, shooting out of the rocks! *epic music* They all say ""look! It¬¥s Dom!"" They all laugh while we hear in the radio Dom say ""I can never leave my family..."" (check!) We see Dom looking back and talking to himself ""Thank you brother... I will miss you"" *nice montage of all the moments in the other movies with cheesy music*  The movie ends with Dom preparing to participate in a drag race in his muscle car, surrounded by beautiful women in minor clothing and rap music in the stereo, so the makers of the movie pretend they understand what the franchise is about.

2017-03-10T20:05:20,"Okay so here it is in short terms  Dom will have to join the new weird blonde girl why? Well she has threatened him if he didn't do it he would kill his family....... so he will need to do it to make sure nothing happens to them. So now his friends will need to help him find out the reason why he is doing it. The rest of the explosions are just for more drama but really doesn't do much. In this clip shown you can see the middle being shot at them but Dom managed to distract the middle and have it chase him and lead it to the submarine as you can will be hit by the middle. Ending will be very simple and lame everyone will be back together eating in the backyard of Doms house or somewhere else in the world enjoying their victory. But as we have seen before this will again not be ending because the new blonde girl had a either a brother,sister,family,friend, or group that will want to get revenge on them. So we will be back with this again next year.

I personally think that this franchise is getting extra juicier and more action-packed, if FaF stuck to just racing then this would be soo boring after a while.

2017-04-17T14:07:34,"Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto and Letty Ortiz are on their honeymoon in Havana when Dom is challenged to a street race at an¬†auto show¬†by local racer Fernando. Dom races for Fernando's car, intending to give it to his cousin, while wagering his own¬†show car. After narrowly winning the race, Dom allows Fernando to keep his car, earning his respect, and instead leaves his cousin with his show car. The next day, Dom is approached by elusive¬†cyberterrorist Cipher, who coerces him into working for her. Shortly after the encounter, Dom and his team, comprising Letty, Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, and Ramsey, are recruited by Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs to help him retrieve an EMP¬†device from a military outpost in Berlin. During the getaway, Dom goes rogue, forcing Hobbs off the road and stealing the device for Cipher. Hobbs is arrested and locked up in the same high-security prison he helped imprison Deckard Shaw in. After escaping, both are recruited by intelligence operative Frank Petty and his prot√©g√©, Eric Reisner, to help the team find Dom and capture Cipher. Deckard reveals that Cipher was the mastermind of previous encounters with the team, such as employing his brother Owen Shaw to steal the Nightshade device and orchestrating the attempted theft of God's Eye, Ramsey's software program. The team tracks Dom and Cipher to their very location just as they attack the base and steal God's Eye. When Dom begins to question Cipher's motives, she reveals that she has held Dom's ex-lover and DSS agent Elena Neves ‚Äì as well as their son, whose existence Dom was previously unaware of ‚Äì hostage in order to keep Dom loyal to her. Elena tells Dom that the child was born as a result of an¬†unintended pregnancy, and that she wanted him to decide the child's first name, having already given him the middle name Marcos. Cipher then sends Dom to New York City to retrieve a¬†nuclear football held by the¬†Russian Minister of Defence. Dom manages to evade her for a short time through a diversion created by Fernando, allowing him to meet with and persuade Deckard and Owen's mother, Magdalene Shaw, to help. The team intercepts Dom after he steals the nuclear football, but Dom escapes, shooting and apparently killing Deckard in the process. Cipher facilitates Dom's escape by hacking into all of the autonomous cars¬†in the city and reprogramming them to auto-drive, wreaking havoc throughout the city. Letty catches up to Dom, but is ambushed and nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes, before Dom rescues her. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes kill Elena in front of Dom. Dom is then sent to Russia to use the EMP device to disable a nuclear submarine, enabling Cipher to hijack it and attempt to use its arsenal to trigger a nuclear war. They are once again intercepted by the team, provided with modified vehicles by Petty. Meanwhile, Deckard, who had faked his death and been extracted by Tego Leo and Rico Santos, former members of Dom's team, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son at Magdalene's behest, with the help of Owen. Once Deckard reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, avenging Elena's death, before rejoining his team. Outraged, Cipher launches an¬†infrared homing missile¬†at Dom, but he breaks away from his team and maneuvers around it, causing the missile to hit the submarine instead. The team quickly forms a vehicular blockade around Dom, shielding him from the ensuing explosion. When Deckard reaches the front of the plane and confronts Cipher, she makes her escape by parachuting out of the plane. Petty and Reisner visit Dom and his team in New York City to report that Cipher is still at large. Hobbs is offered his DSS job back, but he declines in order to spend more time with his daughter. Deckard then arrives to return Dom's son, putting his differences aside with Dom and Hobbs in the process, and is accepted into their family. Dom decides to name his son Brian, after his friend and brother-in-law¬†Brian O'Conner, and they celebrate.",0,0,Ralph Cornelius Castro,jeKBMdYaM3U,0.06851768920734437,2017-04-17 14:07:34,False,True
