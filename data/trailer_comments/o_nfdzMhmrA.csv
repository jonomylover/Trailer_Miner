2017-05-16T16:01:15,"Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[2][8] Not all tumors are cancerous;benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body.[8] Possible signs and symptomsinclude a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements.[1] While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes.[1] Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.[8]  Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths.[2] Another 10% is due toobesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity, and excessive drinking of alcohol.[2][9][10]Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants.[3] In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C andhuman papillomavirus (HPV).[2] These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell.[11] Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops.[11]Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents.[12] Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests.[2] It is then typically further investigated bymedical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.[13]  Many cancers can be prevented by notsmoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty ofvegetables, fruits and whole grains,vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure.[14][15] Early detection throughscreening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer.[16] The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial.[16][17] Cancer is often treated with some combination ofradiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, andtargeted therapy.[2][4] Pain and symptom management are an important part of care.Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease.[2] The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer andextent of disease at the start of treatment.[11]In children under 15 at diagnosis the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on average 80%.[18] For cancer in the United States the average five-year survival rate is 66%.[5]  In 2015 about 90.5 million people had cancer.[6] About 14.1 million new cases occur a year (not including skin cancer other than melanoma).[11] It caused about 8.8 million deaths (15.7%) of human deaths.[7] The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancerand stomach cancer. In females, the most common types are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer and cervical cancer.[11] Ifskin cancer other than melanoma were included in total new cancers each year it would account for around 40% of cases.[19][20]In children, acute lymphoblastic leukaemiaand brain tumors are most common except in Africa where non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs more often.[18] In 2012, about 165,000 children under 15 years of age were diagnosed with cancer. The risk of cancer increases significantly with age and many cancers occur more commonly in developed countries.[11] Rates are increasing as more people live to an old age and as lifestyle changes occur in the developing world.[21]The financial costs of cancer were estimated at $1.16 trillion US dollars per year as of 2010.",0,0,TheXpender,o_nfdzMhmrA,0.12115427675772503,2017-05-16 16:01:15,True,True

Personally, this movie doesn't look that bad, and I think it has clever humor in it as well. People always judge movies by the trailers. When my dad first saw the trailer for Ant-Man, he thought it looked a bit stupid, but when he saw the movie, he actually really liked it. All I'm saying is, don't judge a book by its cover. Give the movie a chance and see it for yourself. If you end up not liking it, that's fine. If you end up loving it, great. If the movie ends up being as bad as people say it looks, then alright.

The colours feel strangely well put together, and some of what we can see look amazing. I personally love the background from 1:45 to 1:48. It's like this pixel waterland with auroras in the distance. It would've been more creative if the pixels were red, green and blue, as those are the only three colours used whenever we see through a screen. I guess it wouldn't have looked as nice though... The firewall was a great pun in my personal opinion.  That being said, the story and characters are most likely gonna be Pre-tty bad. I mean, I can smell the generic fish-outta-water, the love interest, the comedy sidekick and many other cliches to come. Not to mention the concept of emojis... god damn... I bet it'll end with him being accepted and everyone will break their one bland character trait (though some of them can visibly be seen having more than one emotion, because let's be honest we don't want literally just one emotion cause that's the worst thing you could have when creating a character) and express themselves however they damn please.

Tell me, what do you FUCKING see? Blackness. Darkness. A bottomless hole. Starvation. This is what the rapidly growing entertainment media has turned you into. A graveyard, spanning arcs a single body couldn't contain. Death is marked not only on the unseen soil, but also walls and ceilings. You have no space, but you keep eating.  But it sates you not. All you do is toss shovels and produce an ever more growing hole. You feast and you feast upon your own emptiness.   And this is the product. This bile, putrid flesh skinned from plastic screens.  You've turned to gargle even light, produced by foul meaningless icons, just to sate your hunger. Even if you were to vomit, your unquenchable thirst for more would force feed you what your body is in great desperation trying to reject, as you unknowingly cry only to link the tears off of your dirty, blood stained hands.  You have killed everything. You have killed your innocent heart with greed for more. You have killed your mind with creations that exist momentarily. You have killed your pride just to consume more. And you have killed yourself, in an effort to stay alive in this age of blinking attention, all at the hands of a smug, emotionless yellow ball.  You've killed yourself by looking for your own self in the grid of emojis, only to find that you have been staring at your reflection in that black screen in the palm of your hand. The darkness you saw within yourself is now the reality you see in front of your eyes.  This is the result of your ceaseless feasting. You've allowed this to happen. The evil seeds of what you have done, GERMINATES within you. And it spreads. Everything your once beating heart held dear is gone. Replaced with emojis.  This is what you have done. You were weak.

2017-05-19T20:53:51,"Hi. Here's why this movie is bullshit on many, many levels. I’ll be breaking it down in multiple pieces to make it more organised.   EVOLUTION OF THE EMOJI SPECIES  First off, in the trailer you can clearly see emoji’s have parents, looking at the ‘Meh’ emoji. However, in another part of the trailer when the round golden building is being shown, you can see various statues of the emoji’s predecessors, consisting of the :D as the oldest emoji, followed by an 8-bit smiley and ending with the current generation. This raises the question: shouldn’t the parents of the ‘Meh’ emoji be the older versions of the ‘Meh’ emoji itself? Or do emojis slowly evolve over time, with the ‘Meh’ emoji being the slightly more evolved version of his parents? But that wouldn’t be accurate, in the real world (so in the emoji movie, too) emojis drastically change with each update, and they don’t evolve slowly.  Or did the original smileys have multiple kids, with two being the ‘Meh’ emojis parents? That however would contradict another thing we can clearly see: In this universe it is widely accepted that if two emojis have a child, it will take over the characteristics, otherwise the parents of the ‘Meh’ emoji wouldn’t be so concerned about their son not being the same as them. But if that is how this universe works in general, how were the older emojis able to mix their characteristics to create new emojis? Because there never were older versions of the ‘Meh’ emoji for example. Nothing about this is thought through, it doesn’t make sense.   ORIGIN OF THE EMOJI UNIVERSE  Do all phones in our world have a different universe in them, with different civilizations and cultures? What we can be sure of is the fact that all those universes must be fairly modern, looking at the presence of computer and cellphone emojis. But they all seem to have the exact same technology to send emojis, no matter what the operating system seems to be. How have all these emojis, spread over millions of phones, established this worldwide network? One option is that HUMANS have implemented specific programs into these phones, to create these tiny universes. But that wouldn’t make sense. Why would humans implement a whole universe into a phone when they can make a simple program to accomplish the same? How did this universe get created? Do the emojis question this themselves? Do the emojis have their own religion because of this fact? Or maybe even more religions, because every emoji thinks independently so there’s no way there aren’t two emojis who have different opinions on the existence of the universe. Even if the emojis were there for no reason, how did they connect with emojis from other phones to establish this network? This would mean phones have secret compartment in them, specifically designed for contacting other emojis in other phones. And THIS would again implement that HUMANS are behind this established universe. But why are they holding it a secret? We can tell the regular world doesn’t know of this universe because the owner of the phone doesn’t understand why the emoji didn’t turn out as what he wanted to send. Or is this some kind of top secret worldwide government operation to test out how humans can create and manipulate other universes?  Or are all these universes established by a worldwide bug in all smartphones on earth? Are these universes nothing more than a coincidence, like the big bang? This brings us back to if the emojis have their own religion. There certainly aren’t any signs of it being so, but it simply isn’t possible no emoji in that whole universe has thought about the origins of their world. This mystery remains unsolved. And is there a whole world, like a planet floating in its own universe of millions of other planets, or does the town stop at some kind of wall? The emojis function pretty much the same as regular humans, and that would indicate they breathe air just like us. That would indicate they are located on a planet that has evolved like our earth has, over trillions of years. We are given no other information on the earth however; only one specific city. Back to the similarity to earth. This would mean history must have went down like it went down in the real world; but how could this happen when emojis are only used in the last twenty years of the existence of our universe?  This brings us to the next point. Do the emojis have their own perception of time? It certainly sounds far fetched and crazy. But looking at how their universe works it isn’t impossible. For example, when a text is received and the smartphone owner immediately sends something back (= around 20 seconds, maybe) all emojis scramble to the unnamed big golden building, which could take a while. When selected and sent, the relatively slow process of scanning the emoji starts. This process lasts roughly 15 human seconds, but in real life it happens in an instance. This could clarify why the emojis seem to have the same progress in technology and history. But it would NOT clarify why the emoji universe is keeping up with the human world now, slowing down THEIR progress. Let me clarify. At their pace they would be able to explore the universe in a hundred years, but instead of developing new technology at an incredible rate like they did before they caught up with humans they relax and keep up with the humans. In their world, they experience a major holdback of new scientific discoveries because of this. Why? Are the emojis only there to serve the humans? And what is the motive for this? Is it to pay back the humans for creating them, although the human don’t seem to know they did?  The Emoji Universe seems to be influenced by the human world, because the Emoji Universe has human world animals walking around in it. How did evolution go in that universe to end up with human world animals? Or do humans add these animals in an instance with every update? But that would contradict the Emoji Evolution Theory, that every creature has two similar parents that influence the characteristics of their son/daughter. The animals also seem to act human, with understanding basic humour like what the wind emoji and an elephant emoji did as a gag (elephant who farted) and doesn’t function as a normal animal would do in the human world. Looking at how their world is constructed, this is interesting. Their world seems to have to been created like ours, with the same ecosystems and all, but without the vital part of animals doing their job of transforming to what would presumably be the emojis over time. And with the presence of meat emojis the truth is disturbing: the yellow head and human emojis are in charge and control every other species, and kill off animal and food emojis to feed the rest of the society. We know this because no one from their own species would do such a thing in such a developed world.  How do phones work in this universe? Do THEY have emojis in them? That’s another bothering thing. That would implement an infinite loop of alternative universes exist. And this is really where I ran out of things to think of about the Emoji Universe.",129,27,Etcetera™,o_nfdzMhmrA,0.08970785039333425,2017-05-19 20:53:51,True,True

2017-05-20T17:01:46,"If there would be a fidget spinner movie, it would be like this:  Once upon a time in a store, there was a whole community of fidget spinner waiting to get pick. Every fidget was born turning clockwise, but there was one special fidget that was born spinning counter clockwise. During his childhood, he was bullied for being different and everyone told him that he would never get pick when the day come. His life was hopeless at the time. But, when it was the day a fidget spinner was going to get pick, he got pick and everyone was super jealous. They never expected this. They got really mad and decide to hunt him down. They manage to get out of the store and get into the car before it was too late. It took a few minute before the special fidget spinner realise that the other was in the car with him, he got really scared and jumped out of the car. The other didn’t see him jump.  It was a rainy day, so he was alone, wet and cold. He decide to get shelter in the sewer. The other fidget spinner search the entire car before they realise he wasn’t there so they decide to get out and search on the road. At night, the special fidget spinner was still in the sewer crying. The other fidget were not far away, so they could hear him. Once they find him, he panic, but out of nowhere, a girl fidget spinner save him and escape. The special fidget spinner then realise that the girl was spinning counter clockwise just like him. The girl fidget spinner didn’t look surprise after she realise that he was spinner counter clockwise. She said to him that there is a whole community of counter clockwise fidget spinner at her store at the other side of the city. He could be safe there.  (Most of the movie would be them being chase while trying to get to the other store. It’s a romantic adventure)   Once they get to the store the other fidget realise that there are other fidget spinner just like the special fidget. The movie would end with the special fidget giving a speech about being different is ok. Everyone lived happily ever after.

Wreck It Ralph similarities  A character who is supposed to do one thing and nothing else (be a villain or a meh) in order to please the user of the gaming machine/phone. When the character defies this law, people get mad and he goes on a journey to fix his mistake. They find another outcast who feels the same way, (Hi-5 and Vanellope the Glitch) who joins them on a quest to fix things. Then, they end up in a candy themed place they don't want to be in. (Sugar Rush and Candy Crush)   The Lego Movie similarities  A normal citizen people secretly find boring and plain (Meh and Emmet) ends up making a big mistake (making wrong face, falling in a whole and finding the piece of resistance) Then, they find an emo girl character, (Wyldstyle and that weird girl emoji Sony has the nerve to have a romantic interest with Meh) who helps them go on their journey. Meanwhile, a psychotic government control freak chases after them trying to kill them. (Lord Business, Crazy Happy) They send out robots to kill them. (Micro Managers, those weird robots shooting at the emojis) In order to complete their quest, the characters have to go through a very dangerous control center. (Lord Business' tower, the Firewall)  Seriously Sony? It's enough that you make a movie with the stupidest premise and characters you could possibly see in a high budget modern movie, but you can't even come up with a creative plot, or it doesn't have to even be creative, but you couldn't even come up with something *original?* Really?

2017-05-21T01:34:53,"I’ve just seen the first trailer for the Emoji Movie and there’s quite a few things that bother me. I’ll be breaking it down in multiple pieces to make it more organised. EVOLUTION OF THE EMOJI SPECIES First off, in the trailer you can clearly see emoji’s have parents, looking at the ‘Meh’ emoji. However, in another part of the trailer when the round golden building is being shown, you can see various statues of the emoji’s predecessors, consisting of the :D as the oldest emoji, followed by an 8-bit smiley and ending with the current generation. This raises the question: shouldn’t the parents of the ‘Meh’ emoji be the older versions of the ‘Meh’ emoji itself? Or do emojis slowly evolve over time, with the ‘Meh’ emoji being the slightly more evolved version of his parents? But that wouldn’t be accurate, in the real world (so in the emoji movie, too) emojis drastically change with each update, and they don’t evolve slowly. Or did the original smileys have multiple kids, with two being the ‘Meh’ emojis parents? That however would contradict another thing we can clearly see: In this universe it is widely accepted that if two emojis have a child, it will take over the characteristics, otherwise the parents of the ‘Meh’ emoji wouldn’t be so concerned about their son not being the same as them. But if that is how this universe works in general, how were the older emojis able to mix their characteristics to create new emojis? Because there never were older versions of the ‘Meh’ emoji for example. Nothing about this is thought through, it doesn’t make sense. ORIGIN OF THE EMOJI UNIVERSE Do all phones in our world have a different universe in them, with different civilizations and cultures? What we can be sure of is the fact that all those universes must be fairly modern, looking at the presence of computer and cellphone emojis. But they all seem to have the exact same technology to send emojis, no matter what the operating system seems to be. How have all these emojis, spread over millions of phones, established this worldwide network? One option is that HUMANS have implemented specific programs into these phones, to create these tiny universes. But that wouldn’t make sense. Why would humans implement a whole universe into a phone when they can make a simple program to accomplish the same? How did this universe get created? Do the emojis question this themselves? Do the emojis have their own religion because of this fact? Or maybe even more religions, because every emoji thinks independently so there’s no way there aren’t two emojis who have different opinions on the existence of the universe. Even if the emojis were there for no reason, how did they connect with emojis from other phones to establish this network? This would mean phones have secret compartment in them, specifically designed for contacting other emojis in other phones. And THIS would again implement that HUMANS are behind this established universe. But why are they holding it a secret? We can tell the regular world doesn’t know of this universe because the owner of the phone doesn’t understand why the emoji didn’t turn out as what he wanted to send. Or is this some kind of top secret worldwide government operation to test out how humans can create and manipulate other universes? Or are all these universes established by a worldwide bug in all smartphones on earth? Are these universes nothing more than a coincidence, like the big bang? This brings us back to if the emojis have their own religion. There certainly aren’t any signs of it being so, but it simply isn’t possible no emoji in that whole universe has thought about the origins of their world. This mystery remains unsolved. And is there a whole world, like a planet floating in its own universe of millions of other planets, or does the town stop at some kind of wall? The emojis function pretty much the same as regular humans, and that would indicate they breathe air just like us. That would indicate they are located on a planet that has evolved like our earth has, over trillions of years. We are given no other information on the earth however; only one specific city. Back to the similarity to earth. This would mean history must have went down like it went down in the real world; but how could this happen when emojis are only used in the last twenty years of the existence of our universe? This brings us to the next point. Do the emojis have their own perception of time? It certainly sounds far fetched and crazy. But looking at how their universe works it isn’t impossible. For example, when a text is received and the smartphone owner immediately sends something back (= around 20 seconds, maybe) all emojis scramble to the unnamed big golden building, which could take a while. When selected and sent, the relatively slow process of scanning the emoji starts. This process lasts roughly 15 human seconds, but in real life it happens in an instance. This could clarify why the emojis seem to have the same progress in technology and history. But it would NOT clarify why the emoji universe is keeping up with the human world now, slowing down THEIR progress. Let me clarify. At their pace they would be able to explore the universe in a hundred years, but instead of developing new technology at an incredible rate like they did before they caught up with humans they relax and keep up with the humans. In their world, they experience a major holdback of new scientific discoveries because of this. Why? Are the emojis only there to serve the humans? And what is the motive for this? Is it to pay back the humans for creating them, although the human don’t seem to know they did? The Emoji Universe seems to be influenced by the human world, because the Emoji Universe has human world animals walking around in it. How did evolution go in that universe to end up with human world animals? Or do humans add these animals in an instance with every update? But that would contradict the Emoji Evolution Theory, that every creature has two similar parents that influence the characteristics of their son/daughter. The animals also seem to act human, with understanding basic humour like what the wind emoji and an elephant emoji did as a gag (elephant who farted) and doesn’t function as a normal animal would do in the human world. Looking at how their world is constructed, this is interesting. Their world seems to have to been created like ours, with the same ecosystems and all, but without the vital part of animals doing their job of transforming to what would presumably be the emojis over time. And with the presence of meat emojis the truth is disturbing: the yellow head and human emojis are in charge and control every other species, and kill off animal and food emojis to feed the rest of the society. We know this because no one from their own species would do such a thing in such a developed world. How do phones work in this universe? Do THEY have emojis in them? That’s another bothering thing. That would implement an infinite loop of alternative universes exist. And this is really where I ran out of things to think of about the Emoji Universe. THE EMOJI SCAN SYSTEM My second point of interest lays at the scene where the ‘never used emojis’ come into place. As we could see in the trailer, all emojis have to be ready at all times to be sent to another person, otherwise the owner of the phone could bring the device to the repair shop. My question here is: what happens in a situation where the owner of the phone suddenly wants to send a ‘never used emoji’? Isn’t it extremely inconvenient to have the less used emojis not ready at all times? Having the ‘never used emojis’ at the other side of the city would HEAVILY IMPROVE the chances of what they don’t want to happen, to happen. It just isn’t logical. This was another thing that caught my attention: The Emoji Universe seems to use some emojis as non-living parts of their world. Like light switches, doors, locks and bicycles to name a few. How does the emoji scan system work with non-living emojis? Do the living emojis have special versions of these items to scan? Or are all these items already in a scanner, waiting to be sent? The last one would probably be it, looking at the organisation in the Emoji Universe. However, we never see this answered. The same question could be asked with flags, which have to be the exact same shape every time. However it is plausible that the emojis have engineered a wind tunnel which blows the flag in the desired shape, looking at their technology. Cars and other vehicles likely have their own big scanning rooms, but we never see those in the trailer so we can’t be sure of that. PLOT Why doesn’t the father of the ‘Meh’ emoji take over the job of his son? When the ‘Meh’ emoji messes up at the scan, no specific facial recognitions are transferred. His arms, legs, and most importantly his hair are not included in the final scan. This would allow the father, which only has different hair, to replace his son in emergencies. Above all, the parents are aware of the ‘Meh’ emoji’s troubles with staying in his ‘Meh’ character. There’s no excuse for the father to replace his son until a better replacement is found. And now something about the ‘Meh’ emoji: Why is it so hard to remain a meh face for a few seconds? How long has the ‘Meh’ emoji been doing this job? It has never been clarified. But looking at how well he maintains the expressions for other emotions for multiple seconds, it really shouldn’t be hard for him to maintain a ‘meh’ face for a few seconds. There’s no excuse for the ‘Meh’ emoji either. CULTURE Are emojis participating in cannibalism? In the trailer we see living food emojis walking on the street along with the other emojis. But we also see food emojis functioning as actual food. In one scene, in the ‘loser club’, we can see pieces of pizza and some chinese food laying on a table where a cookie emoji sits at. This almost confirms the theory that e",0,0,som Gupta,o_nfdzMhmrA,0.07414743376281838,2017-05-21 01:34:53,True,True

2017-06-06T04:58:13,"Jesus loves you. He is the only begotten son of God, the Alpha and the Omega. God manifested in the flesh as Christ Jesus, who is the great I Am. The word of God was made flesh. He died on the cross of Calvary as an innocent and sinless sacrifice to wash away our sins. He rose again three days later and is the living holy lamb of God. No one gets to God but through him. He is the truth, the way, and the life. Lord and savior! Turn from your sins and repent and be born again by the Holy Spirit. The wrath of God is nigh.  There are more and more floods, plagues, fires, volcanos, etc., that are coming about the world in diverse places. The great tribulation and the mighty wrath of God is at hand. The two preachers on YouTube are a great resource. There are recoded trumpet noises around the world. A trumpet and circular cloud anomaly in the sky was caught on video above Israel. The Lord is sounding his coming, take heed. People will believe the rapture of the church of Christ was an alien invasion/abduction.  https://youtu.be/JCHsqSdMV-4  https://youtu.be/mTOQvDzihTU  Many people have fallen victim to the indoctrination of our society, through merciless repetition and perpetuation in our schools, movies, games, tv shows, toys, news, etc. You probably believe that a bacteria evolved into a tadpole into a lizard, into a camel, then a monkey, then ape, then a human like a Pokémon. Do you know the odds of a cell evolving intelligently by chance?   Check out this video: https://youtu.be/nuMvRExazAw.  The theory of evolution requires a leap of faith in their fossil records in regards to the bridge of man and ape and the missing link. Fossils could be manufactured. Many people use acclimation or adaptation as a means of conjecture for supporting the class species evolution. Yet there is no observable proof of a class species change, due to the fact that they say that it takes millions of years to fully occur, which I believe is false. There is only adaptations within a species (beak of finch, color of skin of man, frog changes color, etc.) This is a leap of faith. So many people are invested in this because the academic society regards it as truth, while the professors get money and prestige, and to go against it would probably mean their career and life's work. Many are too proud to admit the truth.    If you believe in evolution, then you probably believe in the Big Bang theory which is also being pushed on us by society. Saying that our complex DNA sprang forth from unintelligent elements and space dust is like saying that a watch was made by throwing a bunch of rocks into a washing machine, or that a Benz was the result of a Mercedes factory exploding. Without an intelligent force as the source of creation, nothing would be possible in terms of the viability and sustainability of creation. If you think we are the result of haphazard random mutations, then what explains the common intelligent threads among all living beings such as DNA, the phi ratio, golden spiral, and the fact that they are alive?  All of these scientific based theories are undermining the genesis of the Bible and the teachings of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. They want you to think that there is no God and to just live as if YOLO and there is no consequence. Where does your spirit go when you die? They want you to believe that we are just a speck of life on a tiny planet that spins 1000 mph around the sun in a vast universe. Yet we are the center of God's creation made in the image and likeness of our creator, God YHVH (Our flat earth is literally the center of the universe, a geocentric model with a dome) -   https://youtu.be/a_deZIw7qR0 https://youtu.be/TMwys1qft5U  They want you to ""do as thou will"" as propagated by the Satanist Alister Crowley, as well as our American idols and media. The Bible says Satan is the ruler of this world and We wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual wickedness in high places (Ephesians 6:12). The elite who pull the strings are the 33rd degree Freemasons, Jesuits, and illuminati who influence and more or less control our society. They spray chemicals in our air daily, modify the DNA of our food with dangerous pesticides, drug us with pharmaceuticals, keep us busy with unimportant jobs and distractions, and want us to overindulge in poisonous fast food, wine, liquor, premarital sex, and lead us to value material wealth, and exalt ourselves on social media. They want us to believe in aliens and not demons or fallen angels or Satan. They want us to believe HAARP controls the weather and not God. They are cultivating a sinful environment, and we are all plugged in happily and ignorantly destroying ourselves and morals with selfish pleasures and desires. Repent today and turn to Jesus.   They give us a false sense of democracy, an illusion of choice between partisanship. Their goal is propagate hate and fear, and to create a divide among people in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, etc. They want to destroy lives, faith in God, morals, communities, and rule the world with a one world government and the collapse of fundamental Christianity. This is the goal of the matrix. They are building a one world government which will have one religion, don't get the mark of the beast, which could be an RFID chip in your hand or forehead.   This may be hard to accept or you'd rather go with the mainstream and live in sin, but this is the truth as I know it.  Ephesians 6:12   ""We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, rulers of the darkened of this world, and spiritual wickedness in high places.""  2 Corinthians 4:4  ""In whom the god of this world (Satan) hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.""  1 Peter 5:8   ""Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:""  Genesis 3:1-5  ""Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.""  Revelation 12:9  ""And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.""  John 8:44   ""Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.""  John 10:10   ""The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have [it] more abundantly.""  2 Corinthians 11:3   ""But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.""  1 John 5:19   ""[And] we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness""  (KJV Bible)  Jesus is Lord and Savior https://youtu.be/2mgUPt2KI08  Devil's playbook https://youtu.be/tNDz75-9bps  End-Times Scripture https://youtu.be/ZYTnbROuipY  Ent-Time Disaster Signs https://youtu.be/K4SI38ji2rI  World Run by Satanists https://youtu.be/KsXqx56KEyw  Mainstream Satanic Indoctrination https://youtu.be/Pe1QAY3C7n8",0,0,For the Love of Jesus,o_nfdzMhmrA,0.09614731653888278,2017-06-06 04:58:13,True,True

Sure creativity isn't ALL there with OBVIOUS nods to Wreck-It-Ralph and Inside-Out, but other than that, the jokes aren't that bad.  I mean, the main character is 'Meh', not the smiley face. This has me intrigued.  I mean, think of all the situations where if he gets his face done right it'll actually be hilarious? Even though I'd doubt he'd actually do it and the moral of the story will be about the overused 'expressing yourself, regardless of others',  I have high hopes for this movie.  Sure it'll be a bit unfunny in places, sure it'll be real cheesy in others, but don't forget, this is a FAMILY movie. This is a show intending to bring families together, and to bring 'young-uns' up to date with the latest in average technology.

Not just for the reason that it's about the emoji, but because of the fact that it's another generic movie with the same plot as Wreck-it-Ralph, concept like Inside Out but less appealing, and the torture of great actors like Patrick Stewart to voice out as SHIT!(tbh I don't care about the voice actors) What disappoints me the most is that this movie, like animations from Illumination Pictures, were created with less production value and just aims for insane profit from sheeples believing that this will be worth to watch (which is NOT!!!) and tries to blend with millennial culture that just doesn't work at ALL!!

This is the sort of product - because this is not truly a movie, as the word ""movie"" is too suggestive of art - that corporations fawn over. And they did. Believe it or not, three major production studios *fought* to make this happen.  Of course, they wouldn't spend too much: Minions, a product almost as artless as this one, cost $74 million and runs for 91 minutes. In comparison, The Emoji Movie cost $50 mil and runs for 86 minutes. A 91-minute-long Emoji Movie would cost a mere $52.91 million; Sony cares less than the company that brought us screaming yellow screen- fever. They threw as little as they could at it. But that's just the math. In order to fully appreciate how apocalyptic this wretched insult to all things sincere is, consider the following; You, the assumed person seeking entertainment, go to the movie theater expecting to take a break or have fun. And while the blatant advertising (Dropbox is an important plot point, there's a pointless scene with Just Dance, apps all around etc.) and banality may be entertainingly laughable, the very same slithery gargoyles that gave you this product get the money. They count their cash, and they think ""Hey, that worked.""  So they give you more of the same thing. And more of it. And more, until the idiocy is familiar and the ads the norm. It's already happened to music, with the same notes and lyrics repeated over and over again. Here we have the same situation staring us down, except instead of ass and cash the contents are something else they're trying to sell you.  The Emoji Movie is an ad that you pay to see. Of course product placement already exists in film. The Lego Movie and Toy Story both feature products as characters, but those films had heart and personality. Here, there is nothing but product placement. Anything resembling humanity is just padding for the next app to appear. How vile for a product that constantly tells you to ""express yourself.""

I would finally fit in, you know? ah, you fit in, honey. no I don't, mom. I never have. but I could change all that if you just let me! just give me a chance! but what if you get sent out on the phone, making the wrong face? no dad, i'll make the right face! look! maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah? you're so handsome when you make that face. i think he's ready, mel. Meh. come on, dad. let me prove it to you. if you really think you're ready... YES! yes i am! i promise i won't let you down! wow! Congratulations, everyone!

Hi! i mean.. hey.. as you know, i'm smiler, i'm the system supervisor here, because I was the original emoji. Here's how it works. it's nothing fancy! wait a minute... it's really fancy! you each have your own cube on the emoji bar! if alex chooses you, should you be so lucky, your cube will light up! it's showtime! The scanner will scan you, and that scan will get sent right up to Alex's text box. and let me tell you guys, there is nothing like getting scanned for the first time. a har, you're gonna love it. now over here is the favorites section, where you'll find all the most popular emo gees. and of course, you'll find my cube here. whoo. you are smooth. just doing my duty. ha ha ha! what did I say? come on, tell me you aren't just a little bit tempted? Steven, for the last time, I don't want to buy a timeshare. come on, man, it's high five! you know me! i'm a favorite! Alex hasn't picked you in weeks. when he stops picking you, you're no longer a favorite. there's gotta be some sort of mistake, i mean, look at me, i'm an attractive, hand-giving high five! oh! fistbump! come on in! Hey, ladies! FISTBUMP? he's a knucklehead! literally! look at him, I can look like that! ugh, ow, cramp.. big mistake.. oh... help me.. help up a hand.. oh... here you go... thanks mate... hey, little man, how about you create a distraction, and i'll just slip under the rope! uh, oh, is someone lost? smiler, hiya, just leaving. yeah, you know, just killing time before i go back to my cube in the far corner where Alex can't even See Me ANYMORE! you may not be a favorite anymore, but you will always have a place, in a cube! yeah, in the nosebleeds... uh, i'm standing right here? words hurt. The most important thing I can tell you is to just be yourself... basically, happy itself... I am always smiling... places, please! emo gees to your cubes! attention, we've got incoming! gotta be meh, gotta be meh. oh my gosh, my own cube! i can't believe it... oh, i could put a plant over here, and over here could go an inspirational calendar, okay, gotta be meh... look at our son get on there, i'm beaming... with pride! you don't think he'll actually get picked, do you? heiroglyphics. heiroglyphics was an ancient language of picture forms. does that remind anyone of anything. hello. a language of pictures... anyone? early heiroglyphics back in ancient... i gotta reply to addie's text! what should i write? nothing! nothing? words aren't cool. ok, be cool, be cool... alright, alex is not sure how he wants to play this... oh! i would really love it to be me! beam me up! beam me up! i need thumbs up on standby! oh yeah! thumbs up is going in! wait! alex is changing his mind! he's moving! ok, looks like it's gonna be meh... i'm so nervous, i could almost shrug. We are going for meh! initiating scan! okay, you can do this. ah! i can't do this! i can't do it! stop the scan! i can't, it's too late! oh! what's he doing? he's making the wrong face! good for him, little... wait, what? ugh. Abort, abort! Oh, shi... shut it down, shut it down! ah! what is that emoji? all the emo gees present, evacuate the cube! evacuate the cube! i gotta get out of here! i'm trying! oh, jeez. sorry, everybody. that is not what i meant to do! i kinda.. i kinda panicked.. are you even a meh at all? uh, who, me? like you are, is a malfunction! a malfunction? no, i can be meh, just give me one more chance? you know what would be really fun? a board meeting, where we can find out what to do with you! i just wanted to be useful, you know, fit in! now everybody's calling me a malfunction. i am a malfunction. even if you are a malfunction, gene, your mom and dad still love ya. i knew you weren't ready. let's get you out of here and take you home. one day, all of this will blow over, and everyone will almost forget about what you did. Until then, you should probably stay locked up in the apartment. wait, you're gonna hide me away? you're embarrased of me. it's for your own safety. we're trying to protect you, son. gene, where are you going? i'm not going to run away from this. i'm an emoji, and, even though i'm not exactly sure which one... i've gotta have some sort of purpose here, i know it. gene, no! sweetie, please! so, how'd it go, gavel? hey, lightbulb, tell me what's going on in there. what... poop... what is it? tell me turd, tell me truth. what happened? i know it was an accident. We all have accidents you're so soft, poop. not too soft, i hope. i came up here to defend myself, but, uh, you seem pretty happy. So, good news? i'm always happy. Oh, right, yeah, truth. but the only thing that could ever make me unhappy, is if one of our emo gees has made a mistake. which would cause alex to lose faith in the phone... and then, our whole gets wiped out! smiler, i devil pinky swear promise to you that i will never, ever make a mistake in the cube again. oh, we know you won't, gene. We know you won't! haha, you know, the first time you said it it sounded genuine, but then you repeated it, and, and then, now it's weird. we're setting you up! with our best antivirus bots! so they'll, like, uh, they'll just, they're gonna fix me? actually, delete you. but yes! wait, what? if you get deleted, you don't have to worry about department heads, or the future, or lying about being a malfunction! because you're deleted, right? right! good job! bots! no! stop, he's escaped! party time! oh, wait a minute... the air is better here! beer, tea... i'm coffee! sorry... ish... so ish e. my old cube! ugh, pinkeye. mike!",0,0,Ronnie Kenworth,o_nfdzMhmrA,0.22168323716846663,2017-09-28 01:23:09,False,True

It's outstanding plot, supported by a message of being a helpful and productive member of society that can relate to and help others in their time of need is an outstanding emotional masterpiece worthy of an Emmy Award. The voice acting is never boring or unemotional, delivering moving, thoughtful lines that nod towards the true and meaningful nature of this wonderful film, masked under the guise of a children's movie. The animation is top quality, with stunning visual effects and CGi that showcase the constantly evolving and improving animation styles of the modern era. This movie rises above many classic movies, trumping wonders such as the Lion King and Good Burger to achieve its rightful place above at the throne of the greatest movie of all time. Even movies like Gone in the Wind pale in comparison to the emotions and depth portrayed in the Emoji Movie. This one simple yet so elegant masterpiece of a film showcases everything right in the film industry, from the incredibly original and relatable plot line and characters, to the well thought out scripts, scenes and scenarios, not to mention the lovely world building that proves to inspire and create a whole world inside our heads and our phones.
