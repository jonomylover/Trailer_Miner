2017-12-10T03:55:47,"As someone with an actual disability (the kind that probably would have landed me in a freak show in Barnum’s time) I have to say this movie sickens me. I am sorry, but it is pure exploitation.I’m sick of the recent trend in movies to use the subject of someone living life with a disability as ‘inspirational.’ My disability shouldn’t be used as an inspirational story. I live a productive and fulfilling life because there is no reason I shouldn’t. Period. That shouldn’t be treated as surprising or extraordinary.It may have been different if the movie’s central character was one of the actual disabled performers in Barnum’s circus. Or if the movie was about the real life of a disability advocate from that era. Hell, even a made up able-bodied white male circus owner would have been better than this. But it is impossible to separate the fictional character from the real life PT Barnum and his dark exploitative show. Not when it is so recent. All that does is take an already saccharine and insincere message and add an insulting edge to it. It is the equivalent of having Robert E. Lee dancing around singing about how black people shouldn’t let being black make them feel bad about themselves because ‘we are all special.’Like I said: Sickening.",0,0,nia a.,iYPmR1nV0FU,-0.05558581203742493,2017-12-10 03:55:47,True,True
