Forgive me if I'm wrong, I haven't seen the film):  The DUFF was supposed to teach young adults to appreciate themselves and their bodies, despite being ""ugly"" or ""fat."" The acronym was just to put in as a lesson to teach you that IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T FIT IN WITH YOUR GROUP OF FRIENDS. Don't bash on the movie just because it seems to be fat-shaming anyone or anything. And although the girl DOES get the guy, it still teaches you to love yourself.

That was the main point if like everything. I would be pissed if i was the author of the book! Ugh. I finished the book yesterday i read it in two days and it wasnt about a girl who needed a boys approval and changes herself to not be the duff. It was about a girl excepting herself and not caring abouy what others thought of her. And about a boy who learns to be more human and opens up to his problems and becoming a little bit less of a womanizer.
