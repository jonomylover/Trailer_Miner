2013-12-13T05:21:35,People keep saying that there is no god just because the big bang happened. I believe in God just not the exact story of the Bible. I believe a God created everything however I do not believe it was done in 7 days. I believe God chose to shape the earth through the Big bang and all this took millions of years. Then God let the world develop on it's own.Thus evolution is true. I believe Jesus was a good man that was crucified. Not everything said in the Bible could have happened yet I like the message of the book. Be Kind to your fellow neighbors. As for the matter of if there is a heaven or not. It does not matter. I choose to believe that there is something after death. If there is something then I win and I will go there when I die. And if there is nothing after death and we just cease to exist then who am I to complain? I won't exist. Either way it's a win win situation. I am a normal guy unlike those nutbars that keep telling athiests that they are idiots and going to hell just because they don't believe in Jesus. Athiests are cool too. My best friend is an athiest yet she is a vegetarian and an environmentalist. I go to church every sunday and you know what I do? I sleep half of the time. If there was no christianity there would be no christmas or easter. Even athiests put up a tree during christmas go outside and play in the snow just like everyone else. They may not celebrate it for Jesus but still it brings their families together. Maybe we need a little bit of wonder in our lives. If I knew everything to be of scientific origin then where is the fun in that?

Because I actually called on him and seeked to know if he was real in the temple of silence. And low and behold this immense and all knowing spirit that moves through all things, does exist, and he doesn't just exist, you are an extension of him/it/her, you all are, and he knows you and will reveal himself to you IN PRESENCE if you so seek him with good intention. IF YOU'VE EVER called on Jesus, Archangel Michael, or any of the great warriors of the light that come to you in consciousness/presence and sometimes in actual form, YOU KNOW THEY EXIST, end of story.   Blind faith and religious practice is futile. Seeking EXPERIENCE is everything.   Don't let man made fact and religion create beef with the great light beings that can be your source of wisdom and mentorship in this life. Ask for a higher understanding of yourself and your life in the temple of silence, ask to be taught how to tame the mind, live in the heart, these things will turn you into the being you were born to become.   You are a soul having a human experience, not a human with a soul. Your body is finite but your soul is immortal, many of you are smart. But your hearts and your minds are cut off..  Your mind rules your heart, but we are meant for our hearts to rule our minds.  EGO is simply separation from spirit and is unwise and ignorant, learn to let the heart tame the mind and let spirit in. WHEN you allow spirit to COME IN, you learn everything you need to know. This is how its setup.   Theres only one purpose of life, to realize that you are one individual extension of a whole, connected, and to become one with the allness again. Everything in your life is a lesson on how to do this if you so chose to learn those lessons. If not they will simply show up time and time again, waiting for you to learn those lessons and move on to the next set of lessons.   PLEASE, all atheists, I have been where you are, completely cut off from your heart, and with INCREDIBLE beef against all DIVINITY. Just the word GRACE, JESUS, or GOD pissed you off. Let me ask you, WHY? I never knew, until I understood this, YOU have dark consciousness that DOES NOT want to be taken to the light in you RIGHT NOW, i did, and still do occasionally, the journey towards purity is about the dance of light and darkness, but...HEAR these words wisely.   ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE ANY BEEF WITH ANY GREAT BEING OF LIGHT, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, and many more yogis and gurus HAVE DARKNESS IN THEM, it is not a big deal, but man up, face the facts, and contact me if you want to take it out and experience what it feels like to be FREE of fear and guilt and shame and PAIN. Suffering is not your destiny NOR needed. Stop running from PAIN, acting like you are all cool, magically working your Wit and Intellect into this FASAD that you are NOT EMPTY, Be real, I was, you are, give it up. Seriously...give it up, you are not meant to be empty, even if you think you are full, theres SO MUCH MORE security and peace to know.   If you are a compassionate atheist you already know spirit but have a little more work to do disconnecting from the darkness thats causing you to have intellectual beef with the existence of divinity. You are already tasting it, its time to come back to the light...   I will show you how you are limiting the great spirit that moves through all things from entering you and I WILL SHOW YOU how to take out the darkness in you and replace it with the SECURITY of the LIGHT.   "" O how bold one feels, when one is sure of being loved ""   Jesus was a great being, he did (not really how the christians portray 100% but he did) and DOES exist, you can still call on him and he shows up (in full power/spirit), there are millions that call on him that are NOT Christians, they know his strength, power, and wisdom, and ability to mentor and lead you in your life.   PLEASE, rethink your BEEF with the DIVINE and then look in your heart if you believe jesus didn't or DOESNT currently exist. He did not come from earth, he was a soul sent here from another part of this universe who understands communion with GOD to teach us, as others have and like many in this population influx have come here to assist as well. There are many with the passion and goodwill of jesus on this planet right now, but there is alot of darkness, and that darkness has broken down and infiltrated many great beings of light/humans.  MANY MANY MANY atheists are actually great beings of light that have been beaten up and now hold grudges, holding onto energy that blinds them from who they TRULY ARE.  If you are talented with your mind, I can assure you, you are a lightbeing, who's connection to their heart has been severed.   If you are talented as a creative but are an emotional wreck, add, lack of willpower, you also are a lightbeing, who has been disconnected from the heart.   LET the HEART RULE the mind. The mind has polarity, duality, good/bad, right/wrong, it judges everything. Its an unwise and clunky tool without the heart. But the heart, the heart has brain cells, its own energy systems and is meant to rule the mind. The heart is balanced, has the perfect balance of masculine and feminine, it does not operate from polarity but from unity, it has great wisdom, and when you allow it reconnect to spirit it will take over the mind and you will become secure in spirit, wise, compassionate, you will become truly powerful, peaceful and your willpower will return, your optimism will return, your knowledge of earth and sky, of math and of science of art and creativity, you will become who you were meant to become.   BUT, 99% of this world's hearts are disconnected from the mind and the mind roams free, seperated, unwise, clunky, caught up in intellectual orgasms, addicted to sex, unbalanced, without morality, swearing in front of children, being MANIPULATED by the dark brotherhood. And you know what.....  ITS OK! It really is, like I said...we all are eternal and eventually we will all learn how to return to source over hundreds and thousands and millions of lifetimes. But I suggest coming back to spirit in this lifetime.   Its a lot more fun, peaceful, you can meditate and ask for things to show up in your life and you will...its the difference between swimming upstream vs floating downstream, fighting for your place vs knowing your place...  Its alot more fun secured and grounded in spirit.   I can show you how...  I have been on both ends of the spectrum, and I was put there to know the pain of an atheist, even if he hides it externally in his wit and intellect, and the confusion and fear of a christian.   The path is to be fearless.   God is not religious.  Jesus did found any religion.  He said more will come and do what I HAVE DONE, and MORE. He was referring to the great beings that are on this planet right now, some maybe reading these comments.   CUT DOWN your beef with spirit, recognize the ridiculous fear and imagery in your head nomatter CHRISTIAN OR ATHEIST is dark consciousness, accept it and learn how to REALLY let spirit in, REALLY know GOD, really become fearless...  HOW?   Its all in your heart. Get OUT OF YOUR HEAD, drop into your heart (we're talking energetic heart here) and learn how to breath into it, speak from it, think from it, know it, and trust it.   God lives in a heart wide open, and he WILL mentor you and give you PLENTY OF HELP both with great beings of light and physically in this external world helping to align you with WHO and WHAT you need.   Please. Contact me if you want more. I am simply here to help you become fearless and to break down your ego and mind so that you may experience you heart.   THIS IS ABOUT ONE THING, you reconnecting to SPIRIT and your TRUE POWER.  This is about a UNIVERSAL LOVE, a DIVINE LOVE, an understanding of unity, and an elimination of Labels and Religions that create separation. You don't need to be a christian to know the BLISS and GRACE and WISDOM and POWER that jesus can offer you.     Much love,     Benjamin. ",1,0,Benjamin Carroll,WcIXCok9HPg,0.2676560939060939,2013-12-13 18:18:12,True,True

Is it visible? If you don't see then is it exist or doesn't?  The essence of Jesus teaching is following his deeds not just following him. If you accept Jesus then you have to accept to do his teaching, from the way we spoke, the way we did. Even you're not christians, but when you do things that Jesus do then you're doing the right thing. Read bible carefully and see what He teach and what He did.  And whether you believe Him or not, it doesn't mean that He didn't love you all. Whether heaven or hell exist or not, it's not my purpose following Jesus.

Ancient civilizations worshipped the sun as a god. You close your minds in a universe of infinite questions. Most likely, you have the same religious beliefs as your peers and/or your parents. If they were Christian, you would be Christian. If they were muslim, you would be muslim. If they believed in the Flying Spaghetti Monster, you would be believing the Flying Spaghetti Monster. That is not so much the divine truth as it is called, ""fairy tales"". The Bible is a book of horrendous commands and stories.

Even the book of Judges portrays the true nature of the Christian God. Don't get me wrong, some stories are beautiful and some verses are worthy to live off of, but it is not the ""Word of Our Creator"". Atheism is the default of mankind. The material world is where it only counts, the here and now. You have nothing to die for, but you have everything to live for. Make the world a better place because that makes you a good member of the human race, not because you will be rewarded/punished in an afterlife. It is time we throw away the faulty beliefs of our ancestors and see the truth. The world isn't flat anymore. The world is spherical, where the end point is you.",0,0,Louie AC,WcIXCok9HPg,0.12479139218269653,2013-12-18 07:05:48,True,True

2013-12-18T20:27:12,"Atheist don't believe in God because they can't see him or touch him. They believe that this world was created Coincidentally. If they see everything in this world, they will recognise that nothing is created Coincidentally. The computer they use is created by a man. This Youtube is created by a group of people. Everything they use is created by creatures. The question is who create these creatures. Ya, it is right your mother gave birth of you and your mother was one day in your grandmother's womb and if you think like that you will end up to the first women in this world who is the wife of Adam. Who create the first person (Adam) in this world whom we all belong to him. The person can not create himself. Thing of the sun, air, earth and space. why do they look like that? who made them look like that?  The simplest example is to look to your body.  Why does the air you breath go to your lung not your legs?  Why do you eat with your mouth not your eyes?  Who made the air goes specially to your lung? Who made you able to eat only by your mouth?  If Atheist think about this world, they will recognise how this world is very organised and everything has a path to go to, or to come from. Obviously, there is someone who organise all of these... who make the sun rise from the east and set to the west ? Who make that when two clouds meet the rain fall.. why it is only when the clouds meet? why the rain does not fall like that ?  People can not control the clouds meeting neither making the air they breath goes to their legs instead of the lung.  Someone force and organise these things to be like that.. it can be human neither animal or any other creatures.. So, the god who exist over seventh skies organise this world and made it like that.  There is only one God in this world. God of all religions and people. If there is more than one God, the world will be not organised because maybe some gods want the world operate in different ways. So, we conclude that there is only ONE GOD.  People who don't believe in god because it is an abstract thing should not believe in their feeling because it is an abstract thing as well? For example Atheists say prove that the god exist, we cannot see him?  I say to them prove that there is love feeling we cannot see it?  They will reply, but we feel it  In conclusion, we don't see the god, but we feel is exsitence through how the world works, how our body works, how things is organised in this world.   Sorry for the bad english which is not my second language. ",0,0,MsAE93dxb,WcIXCok9HPg,0.07589285714285714,2013-12-18 20:27:12,True,True

That is why the world hates you. 20 Remember what I told you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’[a] If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.",0,0,Sirley Rodriguez,WcIXCok9HPg,0.17708333333333337,2013-12-19 16:27:03,True,True

2013-12-21T19:15:55," Sometimes I grow weary of people trying their uttermost to shut up Christians and what they have to say. I believe that in a country founded on freedom of religion that people should be able to say what they think is true without others jumping on them and calling them Hippocrates, just because they are sharing their belief system. Anyone should be able to say what they believe as long as it is not intentionally said to be hateful. Others don't have to agree with what is said, but at least they should give them right to speak their mind. If a christian states what he thinks about certain sins, in a way that is not slandering toward ones life style then others will accuse them of being judgmental, close minded, and hate filled. He is only trying to say what he thinks is wrong because it is part of his belief system. Christians are not perfect and since they have a moral set of rules, people accuse them of being hypocrites when they break one. It is easier to be a hypocrite when you have many rules to break as opposed to none. It is better to actually have a set of morals to live by than it is to not ,because not having any can lead to  a lot of hate, despair, distrust, and a self destructing lifestyle. Christianity is the only religion that has taught the world the spreading of love to ones neighbors and how to live a moral lifestyle that has been stomped on by others in attempts to extinguish it over and oven throughout the course of history. Christians all over the world have been persecuted throughout history just because of them trying to spread the loving nature of their religion. People accuse Christianity of spreading destruction in history. For example the Crusades. Let me just point out that Christians are not perfect, and especially not mankind, and that anyone can take a peace teaching religion such as Christianity and twist it in order to have an excuse to cause harm. Just because a group of self proclaimed Christians from medieval times did horrific things that do not fit with what the bible teaches, doesn't mean that the bible teaches those or endorses such things. The one religion that has reaped the most destruction is Atheism. I am not saying atheist are evil. I am pointing out certain atheist from history such as Hitler and Stalin. If you don't believe in a God and you believe in evolution and that certain races are superior to others, then what does anything matter, their is no sin. You could do what ever you want to anybody. If their is no God than no one can punish you for doing horrible things to others. You see, the lack in the belief in God can bring many horrific things. Like the killing of 7 million Jews because they were deemed inferior. If their is no God and if evolution is true ,than it makes perfect since to kill of those that are considered biologically inferior in order to speed up evolution. And even if it is a horrible thing to do, no one will punish you. That is the work of the Devil. And is still the work of the Devil today. The media is constantly trying to debunk the bible and we are constantly told Christianity is a lie and that their cant be a God. Everywhere we look evolution is taught and presented as concrete fact. Why is Christianity the religion that is always trying to be stomped on? Because people don't like being taught how to live and people don't want to be accountable for sin. They just want to be able to go on through life and behave however their body desires. You see, sin brings self destruction in peoples lives, that is why it is sin. ",1,0,jonathan ward,WcIXCok9HPg,-0.0024967532467532537,2013-12-21 19:15:55,True,True

He did it himself. He then carried out God's plan then God told him the only way possible to save this world from their sins was to sacrifice himself.

When he was nailed to the cross that's why he said ""God why did you forsake me?!"" He then told God to forgive everyone of their sins because we didn't know what we were doing and deserved forgiveness.

Since his darkened heart could not even know to whom he should beseech forgiveness from, it is incumbent on believer's to refer him to the Bible that He quotes. All believer's from OT Patriarchs (David, etc) down to the apostles. Coffin Doll, please beware, it is the Bible that orders you to fall to your knees and beg Yahweh/Yeshua to forgive your hatred (murder), blasphemy. These are but a few. The old hater inside me really wants to slice you up as a buffoon, and expose your contradictory mental illness, but I will go another route since we all possess some kind of your twisted sin inside. God has, apparently, not taken you through experiences needed to redirect your ignorance. Please beg for that to come soon to spare you from the mauling, swift, chastening that He gives to those He loves - if you are not reprobate. That should be topping your list of angst. God says that ""you need to make your calling and election sure"" - 2 Peter 1:10. I'm just being truthful. I don't know what kind of Biblical/Metaphysical counsel that you have. Sounds pretty lame and incorrect. The scariest thing about that is it is DAMNING. Just want to add that for emphasis. If you are serious about learning the Bible rather than just spewing sludge, Learn what tools you must equip yourself with like Hermeneutics and Exegesis, and what the context is of the Bible verses you quote. In the context of Jesus' harsh rebuking of the Pharisees, Sanhedrin, and the like, he told them that If they love Yahweh, they would love Yeshua (The Son). But it was clear that Satan was ruling their mind, emotion, and will. That's the way it is with sinners. Unless Yahweh regenerates yours. That's why I have not retorted to you in the manner in which you launched your previous post. In closing, It was God's sovereign will and power to actualize what came to pass between the Sanhedrin and Christ. You can't hate the Jews for that because you are really only hating God/Yahweh. Then everyone would go to hell with no exception. As we should. Pretty Amazing!! One last thing that I can't pass over. Jesus was not Black either. Man wants to make Jesus like him instead of (man) being like Him. What idiocy. Mary (Jesus' mother) was a Palestinian Jew. You get one guess as to what Jesus was. I hope you at least check things out for real, Coffin Doll,and don't be sloppy and play the fool by embarrassing yourself anymore. Get into a real New Testament Church.

(we looked actually) and no devil underground either. I think religions are there just to fill a deep need we have to be submissive to things we can't comprehend.. but made humans do incredibly disgusting things, to one-another, no one can deny that. I totally agree that besides the ugly faces of religion, it also brought beautiful things, like music, art, architecture ... through inspiration toward what-ever-god it was at that moment in time/space. I hope for humanity's sake that you people would take your religions with you in the grave, when your time has come, It would end then, but as most of you manipulate, indoctrinate and brainwash your offspring (maybe unconsciously, probably not) to propagate your own and only true belief to hem .. nothing will ever change..

But I really am looking forward to this from both a religious and movie-goer point of view. I really love how this Jesus is portrayed. He's a lively and charmastic man we could relate to and learn about our humanity, hopes, and dreams. Even if this wasn't a movie about Jesus, I would still watch it because the actor does an excellent job in emitting a fresh-but-humbled energy. Most Jesus movies portray him so seriously it's hard to see him as 'one of us'. Those films usually focus on his death and resurrection. Here, this movie seems to explore the life he lived and the people he loved. He's as human as you and me, but obviously special. It seems fitting to see this type of movie since, to be honest, we have all seen stories that have borrowed from the story of Christ. These films showcase 'The One' who will save the human race through sacrifice and hope, whether it's Neo from the Matrix or Superman. Having written that, I think this is a movie that can be appreciated by both the religious AND non religious groups.

2014-01-27T07:56:32,"""In the Beginning was THE WORD. And THE WORD was with God and THE WORD was God.""  ""The"" Implies a singular term, and by translating THE WORD to Latin, we get Uni (One)  Verse (Word).  ""In the Beginning was Uni Verse. And Uni Verse was with God and Uni Verse was God.""  You see? The Bible mentions the Big Bang.  Right after that it goes on to say:  ""And God said 'Let there be Light' and there was Light.""  What came out of the Big Bang?  Light!  What is everything made of according to ""modern science""???  LIGHT!  Light (by which I mean the entire electro-magnetic spectrum) burst forth from an infinitely dense and small particle, forming gasses and dust which became galaxies and worlds, and ultimately the stuff from which life is made.  The Bible says ""He stretches out the Heavens like a tent to dwell in"". And it's true, space-time stretched out from the Big Bang to form a dwelling for all the things that would eventually dwell here.  Jesus said ""In my Father's house are many mansions.""  How do you fit 1 mansion inside a house, let alone many? If the house is Space, and the mansions are Planets, then it makes perfect sense.  The angel said ""Why do you marvel? This same Jesus whom you saw ascend into Heaven will return in the same way.""  This was said after Jesus ascended into a ""Bright Cloud"", the same kind of ""Bright Cloud"" that was seen above Him at his Baptism, and the same ""Cloud"" that led Moses and his people in the desert, ""a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night"".  In the abduction case of Betty and Barney Hill, the first UFO abduction to publicly mention ""greys"", the Hills said that when they questioned the aliens about religion, they got the impression that the ""aliens"" worshiped the UniVerse itself.  If they were ""fallen angels"" then it might explain why the aliens admit to worshiping the Uni-Verse, but refuse to call Him by name.

It is so stupid and you can't see it? Really?  I am an agnostic in the sense that I consider the view of all religions about a so called god or even gods are so childish and foolish; such that we must seek out for answers of our own and discover our true meaning, not by what any religion or stories in their literal meaning, but by the people around us that influence us, lessons every day we learn, challenges that is bestowed upon us, and by our own instinct.  And imagine what would it be like if I said these words back in the day of the Pharisees? I'd be considered blasphemous and maybe be killed like the man named Jesus who stood up for what he thinks is right.  I like Jesus the man, I really do; and I consider him as an early hero or martyr that fought the oppression during his times, like how Martin Luther King or Jose Rizal or Gandhi or Mandela did for their people and country.  I think we might have had the wrong interpretation of the texts written ages ago. Look at the varying accounts of different gospels with one story, it is not consistent; and also the virgin birth and the resurrection story points of the texts are not the main points of the early bibles. It is his story of how he fought the oppression, helped people and his leadership that lead to peaceful attacks against the authority. He is an activist, a peaceful one; and the texts serves as his accounts for what he has done.  As for the resurrection story, the story also varies with different books of the bible. Such that it implies that what it means is that the will of Jesus is resurrected among his disciples or followers that they carry such will and continue to do good deeds as Jesus has already done in a peaceful and meaningful manner.  This is I say as an agnostic: Find who, what, which or where is a god or gods, if he/she or it is even a person, a particle, a quantum particle, an equation, a phenomena, an origin or whatever she or maybe he or yet maybe it. Learn from the true history of the past without the obscurity of fantasies, misbeliefs or misinterpretations. Be a good person for whatever you think is good based on the lessons you learned or learning.  And the last truth: it is on you, not me, not other people nor even the most influential people to you.

2014-02-05T00:07:46," ""Gods Not Dead, and You Can't Kill Him""        A thesis with argumentations    I say to you citizens of the USA and members of the world that discrimination of all walks and ways of life are anything but solved. I am a white, Christian, Southern male who has been born and raised in the American way of life. This way of today is prosperity, equality, and opportunities for all who choose, but I say this growing up with my walks of life I have seen nothing but immediate prejudice and criticism from other fellow US citizens and members of the human race. And it was and still is these fellow men and women of society who proclaimed their own discrimination, inequality, and unfair treatment from others which include those with my walks of life. Now it is by no means for me to pardon all these acts by my heritage, but that does not mean for all those who my heritage in generations past discriminated to continue in my generation to oppress, political and social, myself, ways of life and those who share in my heritage, because of actions that our heritage in past generations committed, to this very day. Now from my own experience I could not walk down the streets in the Capital area of D.C wearing a Christian T-shirt without being criticized or being held against other civilians' prejudice because of my religion. And they said to me and I quote "" Why do Christians even show up all they ever do is hate, disapprove, and chastise everyone?"" To this I say wasn't it Jose Sarria who preached on equal treatment for homosexuals, then what of equal treatment and non-prejudice actions of homosexuals to heterosexuals.   towards this very speech itself even those of my own heritage will shy away from this truth because they know that any acceptance of this truth will end in further isolation, prejudice, and discrimination against them from other groups of people. And what of other faiths? The Christian faith is one of acceptance and forgiveness through peaceful methods. All who deny this base their arguments off of few groups or events who do not display these beliefs such as Westboro Baptist or Crusades. Christianity accepts all people of different walks of life while not approving of the choices but not condemn g them of it but rather accept and love them. So I say to the USA and the world what is the evidence of the eradication of prejudice and what does prejudice mean to you? Remember prejudice has one definition and does not bend to fit others desires. And the President who proclaims his Christian faith but endorses gay marriage I find that he faces struggles of homosexual radicals who pressure society into submission to their grievances which he fears if ignored could cause hate for his own administration which shouldn't matter because this is his last term. I say to these current social reformists look to the women who gained suffrage and how they act today feminists do not act out in pointing out the faults of the male social groups. Where do you stand in comparison for mature reforms? Lastly on the topic of our nation's Constitution, this document was based on Christian principles and if the allowance of gay marriage under the reasoning it is Unconstitutional not to, then you have dismantled the very foundation of our nation which is hypocritical. All these truths to say of pressures and forced guilt on the white, Christian, and/or males of society. I refuse for my generation,when we are adults, to live in a nation that has conquered the prejudice of the past, yet convicts those of prejudice in the future. Let it be known today that the ones who spoke out or are speaking out against prejudiced have forgotten their own truths and had sought out the enemies they had fought against but now use to their own personal gain, I am human, you are human, she is human, he is human, they are human, WE are ALL human!   This is not about politics this is about the endless condescending of my faith because it does not make you feel comfortable to be around or something you don't like. This is about society's efforts to abolish Christian customs because it goes against a current popular trend. This is about you and others hypocrisy on prejudice and judging the faith before knowing it. This is also about your failure to recognize that other faiths have this belief. This is not about politics or hate I say to you look to your self what have you done to hurt the lives of people you meet on a daily basis because their not like you and then compare it to the lives my faith and others have touched positively of people we will never meet again because we accept all and that includes you sir I respect your being but I reject your principle which is something society wishes to think my faith as not doing so God Bless you sir I will be praying for you I wish to see you in heaven with me one day!  First off Christianity is not meant to make people feel comfortable rather than awkward and you would realize that the real purpose is to bring honor and glory GOD and lead people to him. Being a Christian isn't just about being good it is about having a personal relationship GOD. Succumbing to the world to please it is the opposite of GOD's will and desire. Besides if you are a Christian ten you would also realize that homosexuality is wrong making people. Making people feel bad about it is wrong. Christians are here to rebuke the sinful concepts and help those with it to change their ways in love. Also Christian customs are being faded away because it does not make atheists or others who don't agree feel good why do you think most people say happy holidays? I do agree with you On the fact that we shouldn't force it down peoples throats, but at the same time people who don't agree shouldn't have the privilege to take away from us because it doesn't make them feel good and then force their customs to be taught in school. Now the way Phil Robertson said what he said could have been more out of love for Christ but what he said was true and the show from the very beginning has said that they are a Christian family and if you don't like it you can just turn off the television or change the channel or mute the parts you don't like but don't change the show to fit your needs they're contract has a freedom of speech corollary which gives them the right on media to bring up matters such as this. Now the Constitution is a Christian based document, I am a US political science major and if we were to take out all Christian aspects of the document then the country would allow theft, murder, political immorality, end of charities, and rape. Our society wishes to avoid and use these respectively but the refuse to admit they are Christian truths. Also technically all schools public and private are required to teach Creationism and Evolution for the classes categorized by the clause of 1852 for equal education of youth, but not anymore because it makes people feel confused or bad. This is breaking law disobedience a sin. Madame this time is very foreshadowing of the times to come for our faith we are beginning to see persecution in our own nation now it is small but will grow if you please would realize this that would be great no matter what denomination you are.   This is not the time for the groups of society to become hostile towards one another but rather to recognize the truths that all reform groups came to recognize in society during the progressive era rather than the social terror that was plagued by gangs in the 90s. Is it not true that most of us have friends and family. Yet no matter how much we enjoy them we still yet find that there is a flaw they have that you don't like. This is the relationship me and my faith. You don't hate a person for one flaw but love the rest of them and accept that that is just who they are as a person. Officials, clergymen, and citizens I know that this nation is in a Guilded Age but I don't know if the Progressive Era will go to help the masses and not the lives of a few.  Opposers      You immediately shutdown any validity of GOD but are willing to accept scientific theories as truths to the point where in schools they have to teach you they are just theories. My GOD is mighty to save. Society has preached against prejudice but fails with that in Christianity because they view christianity through crusades and westboro baptists. Bad things  will always happen because of what I call sin or what you call and accept as entropy. Besides atheism is completely absurd in that it fails to disprove the Bible and the existence of GOD but time and time again history and archeology only prove the Bible and GOD. Let me ask you this in school the hardest subject you had understanding you tended to hate the most. If atheism only goes by laws of natural tendencies then how is it that you still believed in the teachings of the hard subject but not the Creator. Reason you don't study or make an effort to know him. If the Dead Sea gets saltier every year at an astounding rate why can't humans walk across it considering the Earth and the modern platonic positioning has been around for millions of years. Archeology and historians have even translated the Dead Sea scrolls and found a total of 0 differences between it and the modern book of Isaiah. Don't believe in a Creator tell me what's outside the universe considering were taught that there is no multiverse then tell me that out of all the planets that we have discovered and the rest in the universe that the Earth is the only one hospitable for life and that the  Earth is positioned just ever so perfectly that it doesn't dry up. If you can't create or destroy mass, and there is no multiverse then how am I even here or how is anything even here. You can't explain it without theories that can't be proven and haven't been proven for years now this nation and world needs to realize what's all round them and looking everyone in the eyes. That is a man I call Wonderful counselor, Alpha, Omega, Holy One, Resurrected One, the one and only explanation of all of history of existence and it's future, GOD our Creator.

I know this because I Just finished watching the whole section of episodes about Jesus literally last night. Second, as much as you extremists say that Hollywood is trying to brain wash us with the white Jesus thing. The actual creators of this series are Christians, the guy who plays Jesus is a Christian, and he is from Portugal, many of you probably think he is American or British or something, cause you cant get over the fact he is white... Thirdly, they have to add certain things so that it makes sense as a Show or as a MOVIE. If you cant handle that small last fact, then get lost and stop complaining. And lastly, to all those atheists or other people, if you have nothing nice to say, why do you need to say it. I dont sit here all day saying its stupid in believing in nothing.

2014-02-14T01:33:07,"Personally I feel that any person of any religion who commits a murder even if on a massive scale (war) has no God. For if  God were truly within the temple of men (the body) their actions would be consistent with that of  the one who came proclaiming the truth. Remember God says let vengeance be mine. Romans 12:19  The children of the righteous one or ""wheat"" (Matthew 13:24-30) will be known by their faith in upholding  the gospels & Gods laws. While the ""tares"" or children of the ""wicked one"" lived alongside the wheat though in spirit they did not serve by belief nor in reverence to God and placed self importance of man over observance to the most high.  The son of God that is.. Jesus who is one & the same with the father came to offer himself in human flesh as a ransom through the shed blood of Christ to reconcile man with God. He has provided a safe exit is the ONLY WAY to access the life ever lasting in eternal heaven. Please be aware that the highest form of ignorance is to condemn and dismiss this before properly and thoroughly investigating it.  The dragon (AKA Satan or the serpent) has succeeded in deceiving the whole world before your very eyes. With the support of a beast that uses o form of symbolism to communicate & witchcraft to cast spells upon the masses via the medium of television you have been saturated in a virtual matrix designed to keep you asleep and in darkness. Ephesians 5:14 Awake O sleeper & arise from the dead & Christ shall shine upon you & give you light.  To each man must he decide a path to follow. Choose life and live in Christ. He is the truth and the way. As the master he was rejected and scorned so you too as the servant shall be also. Remember Luke 9:26 ""Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.""  My dear brothers and sister in Christ.Do not be fearful to engage in the spiritual battle for souls brought against you by your enemy and the forces of darkness, Pray often and receive Christ in the Eucharist so that his grace may fill and sustain your hearts so that the light of God may shine through you as a beacon for others to see.

If you believe the bible, they describe him as hair of wool with tanned, brownish skin and he couldn't have long hair since it was shameful for men to have. And if God created the universe, meaning every single planet and star which are billions of times bigger than Earth, why would he take a special interest in Earth, and more specifically why would the creator of the universe care about you...or me and what we do in our personal lives (which include sexually)? And if babies do not sin why not support abortion since they go straight to heaven and dont have to live in this sinful world and thus become sinners? LOL do you people have any logic? *sigh* poor, brainwashed sheep. Believe whatever you want i guess, sorry for sounding smug and insulting its just that these questions have always been ignored when i ask them which led me to become a non believer. I usually get replies like ""ill pray for you"" or ""jesus loves you"", which in turn creates more non believers and more doubters. I am not atheist by the way, agnostic. Enjoy the movie nevertheless. ",26,27,Amber Russel,WcIXCok9HPg,0.07674362674362677,2014-02-27 03:15:40,False,True

2014-02-28T03:10:23,"Some food for thought.  For centuries men have argued over whether a Jesus of Nazareth existed and still we have not reached a consensus, but it’s submitted that no man can argue that if every person emulated this man’s character (real or otherwise) in our daily lives, we would be a far more happier, peaceful and caring civilization with less problems.  Humans have such incredible potential and can be so wise, but yet can be confounded by such simple truths and principles.  The world would rather emulate celebrities, singers, other high profile and questionable characters and things.  It’s troubling and saddening that actors who “portray” doctors in film and television are idolized and worshipped, while the “real life” doctors quietly go about saving the lives of our loved ones and ourselves unnoticed and unappreciated. What have we become.  It could be said that we’ve become such a negative, greedy and jealous people, constantly trying to find fault with one another, engaging in all manner of deception and envying the possessions or position of another.  The laws that God adheres to and the process by which an individual goes through to test the validity and truth of those laws is no different to the process an individual would go through when seeking a knowledge and testimony of any physical law that we know, such as electricity, physics, engineering etc.  The individual (1) studies the law (2) tests or applies the law in action, before (3) understanding and obtaining a knowledge (testimony) of how the law works.  We wouldn’t allow an individual who has never studied and obtained the required qualification and registration for an Engineer to give us a sermon or design our homes or buildings.  Nor should we take heed to anyone who has not seriously and genuinely studied, tested or applied God’s laws (and there are more than 10) and then come to a personal knowledge of their experience or expect that taking heed to anyone who has will result in a personal understanding and testimony for ourselves.  There are no shortcuts, each person must diligently pursue their own course to discover the truth.  Just as one person cannot be a proxy engineering student for another, thinking the other will receive the requisite knowledge and understanding by way of proxy.  It just doesn’t work.  A final point.  Whether a person believes in the laws that govern electricity or not doesn’t make the laws any less valid nor does it affect the consequences if a person misuses the laws.  One will still be electrocuted irrespective of belief.  The same can be said for our Heavenly Father’s eternal laws.  The only difference is, for the most part, the consequences are not as spontaneous as the laws that govern electricity or other physical laws (that would be too easy), but the consequences for misuse will follow irrespective of belief.",2,0,Geoff Ward,WcIXCok9HPg,0.11409722222222222,2014-02-28 03:10:23,False,True

The Church teaches the following about the cessation of the Old Law and about all who continue to observe it: Pope Eugene IV, Council of Florence, 1441, ex cathedra:  “The Holy Roman Church firmly believes, professes and teaches that the matter pertaining to the law of the Old Testament, the Mosaic law, which are divided into ceremonies, sacred rites, sacrifices, and sacraments, because they were established to signify something in the future, although they were suited to the divine worship at that time, after our Lord’s coming had been signified by them, ceased, and the sacraments of the New Testament began; and that whoever, even after the passion, placed hope in these matters of the law and submitted himself to them as necessary for salvation, as if faith in Christ could not save without them, sinned mortally. Yet it does not deny that after the passion of Christ up to the promulgation of the Gospel they could have been observed until they were believed to be in no way necessary for salvation; but after the promulgation of the Gospel it asserts that they cannot be observed without the loss of eternal salvation. All, therefore, who after that time [the promulgation of the Gospel] observe circumcision and the Sabbath and the other requirements of the law, the holy Roman Church declares alien to the Christian faith and not in the least fit to participate in eternal salvation.”  Pope Benedict XIV, Ex Quo Primum (# 61), March 1, 1756:  “The first consideration is that the ceremonies of the Mosaic Law were abrogated by the coming of Christ and that they can no longer be observed without sin after the promulgation of the Gospel.”",0,0,jet2777,WcIXCok9HPg,0.014090909090909095,2014-02-28 06:07:16,False,True

One thing I wanted to share is that it is written that preaching of the cross is foolishness to them that perish, but to us who are saved it is the power of God. It is also written that the non Jewish people seek for wisdom which is so true, they seek the advice and things of man than seeking God. But that is why God says He is putting to shame to the wise , the scholars. That is why many high class people or even people in high places (not all them all them but most of them) don't ever turn to God because they seek after the the wisdom of this world. But those who don't believe are blinded to the truth, man, the world and the devil himself have clearly attacked the true Christian church, especially the devil who uses the world to get his will done. By the way he does a good job of not revealing himself but he does a job of instilling fear and other destructive things or ways to man. Remember the bible is true God has restored His people Isreal after close to almost 2000 years. And Isreal the nation to watch as these last days continue to roll. Last thing the bible says is that a man will rise who will instill a one world government or order where he will be exalted and request to be worshipped and to have a mark. This is VERY close this is the antichrist and will be set by the devil himself, those who worship him worship the devil. You may not believe God but remember His word, and God loves you who don't believe in him, call to Him call out Jesus and give Him your heart, your worries,your burdens, the spiritual burden you seek but can't fill.

We as humans focus so much on the outside. We don't put enough focus on our inside. I was raised catholic and never heard the name Yeshua. Until a ladies voice told me in my ear over and over Yeshua. I had to google the name to find what the word meant. Meditation and prayer of today's standards are different. To pray in today's standards you simply recite prayers and maybe say something from your heart when your stressed. But to speak to Yeshua, you must go far beyond the physical and go deep within. Thru meditation which I learned from a Theravada Buddhist monk. Will open the door way to such a stronger spiritual high. Yeshua has come to me a hand full of times.  I found out thru him that Mother Mary whispered his name to me. She wanted to remind me what Yeshua did for all of us. He has taught us many things. This everyone has heard, "" Yeshua told me he is the Truth, the Way and and the Life"". And you too will be the truth, the way and the life. He's teaching is simple, he wants all of us to become the truth, the way and the life. In the beginning of time. Our souls were most sacred to humans.  Over time worldly things started to be more important. The world fell into a deeper spiritual hole. Ultimately we ourselves are responsible for our actions. No one else.

There are moral laws and rules just as there are the laws of physics. When we disobey Gods commandments we will suffer. Jesus said ""Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength."" ""and thy neighbor as thyself"" And so many don't love God. they love themselves, they certainly don't love their fellow man.  Jesus Christ taught love and people seem to think that Christianity is making people mindless sheep. If you look at what Jesus taught and what his whole purpose was about was to LOVE and to WAKE UP. It was self serving people who killed him and it is self serving people who hate Christianity today. They think it is taking away peoples free will and this is not the case.

If he is all powerful then why doesn't he make everyone be good and why doesn't he prove he's real?"" God wants us to love him. He wants us to really truely love him. Yes he ABSOLUTELY COULD force us to love him and force us to all be good but then it wouldn't be real love or real goodness. The ONLY way he can have our REAL TRUE LOVE is to let us have total free will. Our very short 80-90 year and too often much shorter, lives, is just a test. If we serve God and really truely love him no matter what evil bad things happens to us throughout our short lives here on earth then we pass that test and then our REAL lives will begin. The ones that pass this test are the ones that God knows REALLY TRUELY LOVES him and they are the few that will get to live FOREVER AND EVER with him and then there will never again be any evil or sickness or sadness or anything bad ever again. Those few will live in such a state of bliss that we cannot even begin to imagine what it might be like. Non-believers ALWAYS say, ""you can't prove God exists and if he does exist then why doesn't HE prove HIMSELF?"" Well I CAN""T prove he exists and he DOES NOT HAVE to prove himself to you because he IS the ALL powerful, the ALL mighty and he IS forever. Why SHOULD he prove himself to you. He wants poeple who will love him no matter what and will still believe in him with no proof needed. Thats why he let ALL of us, good or evil, have TOTAL free will because it's the only way to see who will be worthy of all the wonderful, awesome gifts he has promissed, to the few who will pass this test called ""life"", when this short life is over. The world has turned its back on God and more people than ever before now says that he doesn't even exist so why do you THINK so much bad stuff is happening. Maybe he figures that if the world doesn't want him here, then he will just let the world have what it wants.

WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS YOU NEED TO BE SAVED ETERNALLY:  Ephesians 2:8-9 says, ""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.

2014-03-07T18:42:50,"I want to say to everybody here: please be more understanding and be less arrogant. Think before you speak (metaphorically then) and question yourself first before questioning others. Learn to use logic in a correct way (atheists and theists alike) and ask yourself what you are trying to prove.   In my understanding not science nor religion are, but philosophy is the answer to life's most difficult problems. True understanding of reality (the one we experience, not the one we live in) comes from understanding our self. People tend to claim that some things in life (without really questioning the things, themselves or the one who poses them) must be true, because it was said or written by a person to whom they attain certain authority. To some he is either a god or a prophet, to others that person is a scientist, a teacher or a politician.   Modern creationists claim that a compilation of books (being the Bible) is a good base to deliver a correct argument that explains the workings of the world. They make two mistakes. The first is the obvious one, the one where they use the Bible as an authority to prove that the Bible is an authority. There must first be an act of belief before one can continue in this reasoning. The second one is the claim that we can actually really understand how the world works. It is a common mistake, still made by non-creationists as well.   Where is the prove that what we perceive is right and how we reason is correct? Isn't that a leap of faith too? I will point out two things: an illusion feels real but it remains an illusion. How can we know if our real perception isn't false, isn't an illusion? Second, a dream feels right and true when one dreams it, but wrong and irrational when one is awake. So it is possible to experience a completely different form of rationality, which is, when we are awake, not rational at all. Surely we cannot claim then that our awake logic is in fact more rational than our dream logic when we dream?   Some extreme non-believers have the tendency to state scientific facts as absolute truths without questioning them. They assume that what they learned at school, or what they heard from their friends or saw on televisions must be true. They attain a form of authority to a person, assuming that he isn't wrong. This is also an act of belief. A bad argument against this would be that scientists change their views when they are proven wrong. This is true (in theory) but the scientists who are proven wrong are the persons to whom authority is attained. They are not the persons who attain (well they obviously do in other cases). One can compare it with a creationist who never read the Bible but makes claims about it and about reality based on the findings and interpretations of others, who, he realises, could be wrong.   Another thing that is to be said on the subject of science is that most non-creationists believe, for instance, in the existence of black holes. Who has ever experienced the existence of a black hole? Yes one has seen photo's made by Hubble, depicting black holes. Are these photo's real? If so, what do they depict? One sees a black hole in the picture because one is told to. Then how can we be sure about anything? All we have is doubt. This is a subject which has been thoroughly researched in philosophy.   The Bible is, however, a part of our Western identity, it is a beautiful collection of stories, wisdom and lessons, but it is a book written by men for men. That does not make it worthless. The Hygienist movement in the 19th century was wrong to believe that filth is the origin of disease, yet understanding that their actions (removing filth and cleaning cities) have actually reduced diseases (because bacterial life flourished in such environments) should make you understand that our modern day assumptions, which we consider as true, could be wrong. It would be necessary to keep that in mind when claiming that other people are wrong and you are right. This does not make the Hygienist movement an utterly worthless movement in the eyes of history, they, in fact, really have had an impact and brought us partially to our understanding of diseases today (and saved people and cleaned our cities). Some people also make the mistake of looking at the past with an anachronistic view. They then imply a feeling of superiority over the past whilst claiming that those people in the past, who were then wrong according to their anachronistic view, should have respected people with other views in stead of burning them at the steak, whilst judging other people with other views themselves today.  Conclusion. We cannot know anything, the more we know the more we realise that what we know is nothing. We are not perfect and should not act like it. We are not a depiction of the divine and so isn't our reasoning. We are animals whose primary objective is to survive, not to understand. Realise this and act like this. Peace.

2014-03-10T01:39:53,"@ dahim-blackhell benyahia  God's intellect is indeed personified by the Son as is his love is personified by the Holy Spirit.....  ""Accordingly we reply that the term person signifies nothing else but an individual substance of rational nature. And since under an individual substance of rational nature is contained the substance, individual, i.e. incommunicable and distinct from others, whether of God, of man or of angels, it follows that a divine Person must signify something subsistent and distinct in the divine nature, just as a human person signifies something subsistent and distinct in human nature: and this is the formal signification of a person whether divine or human. Since, however, that which is distinct and subsistent in human ‘nature is nothing else than something individualized and differentiated from others by individual matter, it follows that this is the material signification when we speak of a human person. But the only thing that is distinct and incommunicable in the divine nature is relation, since all that is absolute is common and undivided. Now in God relation is really the same as the essence. And as in God essence is identical with the one who has the essence (e.g. the Godhead is identical with God), so also is relation the same as the one who is related. Consequently relation is the same as that which is distinct and subsists in the divine nature. It is evident then that person commonly speaking signifies an individual substance of rational nature; while a divine person in its formal signification denotes a distinct being subsistent in the divine nature. And seeing that this can be nothing else but a relation or a relative being, it follows that in its material signification it denotes a relation or a relative being. Hence it may be said that it signifies a relation by way of substance not qua essence but qua hypostasis, even as it signifies a relation not qua relation but qua relative: e.g. as signifying Father not as signifying paternity. For in this way the signified relation is included indirectly in the signification of the divine Person, which is nothing but something distinct by a relation and subsistent in the divine essence""  Aquinas ( Quaestiones Disputatae De Potentiae Dei)....and so God to love perfectly must share his love perfectly in some aspect that is through the persons of God whereby in a spiration of procession God the father loves perfeclty God the Son through the spiration of the Holy SPirit which proceeds from both..since God cannot love himself perfectly since this is vanity and a sin God needs love a person perfectly as some other in relation but in substance must needs be perfect since God himself is perfect..we are imperfect and so God loves us but we cannot receive his perfection since we are potentiated by him....",0,0,john konnor,WcIXCok9HPg,0.2339285714285714,2014-03-10 01:39:53,False,True

2014-03-10T02:29:57,"This is not CHRIST this is Cesare Borgia.  Jesus is not the Messiah's name. There are no J's in the Hebrew Alphabet. The letter J wasn't even Invented until the 1600s. The first 1611 King James Bible didn't have the name ""Jesus"" in it but Iesous. Then once they took out the Book of Enoch and the Apocrypha they switched the name Iesous with Jesus. Iesous is GREEK spelling of the messiah's name and Zeus was a God(Fallen Angel) worshiped in GREEK Mythology. That's no coincidence. It's also no coincidence that Jesus, Iesous, Zeus are all corresponding related words. Jesus is Esoteric for Zeus. No where in the Bible did God authorize MAN to ""translate"" or change the messiah's name(Yeshua) which means God is Salvation(God is our Savior).  There is only One God and that is the Most High.  1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,  Isaiah 44:6 - Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.  Isaiah 43:11 - I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no savior.  When God sent his Son down he didn't send his ""Biological Son"" he sent his Son meaning his SUN as in his LIGHT to LIFE. Sun/Son are both two corresponding words. Sun comes from the Old English word Sunne just like Son comes from the German word Sonne. Sonne is also Sunne in Middle High German. German is older than the English language which proves my point. They're both corresponding words.  John 8:12 - Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the LIGHT of LIFE.  The Sun here on Earth as we know it is the LIGHT to LIFE.  John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 3:17 - For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  Humans have manipulated and altered the Bible and have deceived the world with Christianity which is a Esoteric Pagan Religion.  The word 'Amen"" is a ERROR ""translated""(inserted) word from the Hebrew word Omein. Amen is Esoteric for Amon which is why you hear some people pronounce it ""Amon"" instead of Amen. Amon was an Egyptian God deity so when you say Amen/Amon you are honoring the Egyptian God deity Amon. No where in the Bible does it say it is Mandatory to use the word Amen after Prayer.  The word Easter was switched with the word Passover. Easter is a pagan ritual that comes from the Goddess of Ishtar and Fertility(Bunnies do not lay Eggs).  Christ wasn't born on December 25th, Nimrod was. Christmas is also a pagan holiday. Santa is really Satan and his little Elves are his Demons. How did they get the name Satan Claws oops I mean Santa Clause* from Old Saint Nick anyways? The five pointed star on the top of the Tree is the Goat Head and when you open your Gifts you subliminally BOW to the Tree. It's all Satanic. The Bible tells you not to put a tree in your house anyways.  Since when did you need a BOOK to know God spiritually? There is only one God people and that is the Most High. God is our Savior not ""Jesus"". The Devil has deceived the whole world with ""Christianity"" what better way to FOOL the Church by blending in WITH the Church?  Study the Torah & Tanakh and you'll see how humans have manipulated the Bible.  You really think God was some blonde hair blue eyed white guy(Cesare Borgia) in a Dress and and some Flip Flops who sounds like Shakespeare?  ""Woe, Unto Thee, For I say, Shall, Behold!' come on people.

John 9:17  4)And when the people saw the sign which he had done, they said, Truly, this is the prophet who is to come into the world. John 6:14  5)And they were bitter against him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his family. Matthew 13:57  Check the verses of bible and you will see that the Qur´an is the last message of God. Because Qur´an says Jesus is only a prophet as Moses, Abraham etc.  And in the Qur´an you can find the birth of Jesus, too. The title of the chapter is ""Mary"". In the bible there is not even chapter titled ""Mary"". Look: Miracles of Jesus in the Qur´an.  ""And mention, [O Muhammad], in the Book [the story of] Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east. And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man. She said, ""Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah ."" He said, ""I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy."" She said, ""How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?"" He said, ""Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.' "" So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, ""Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten."" But he called her from below her, ""Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream. And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates. So eat and drink and be contented. And if you see from among humanity anyone, say, 'Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Merciful abstention, so I will not speak today to [any] man.' "" Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, ""O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented. O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste."" So she pointed to him. They said, ""How can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child?"" [Jesus] said, ""Indeed, I am the servant of Allah . He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet. And He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as I remain alive And [made me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched tyrant.And peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I am raised alive."" That is Jesus, the son of Mary - the word of truth about which they are in dispute. It is not [befitting] for Allah to take a son; exalted is He! When He decrees an affair, He only says to it, ""Be,"" and it is. [Jesus said], ""And indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path."" Then the factions differed [concerning Jesus] from among them, so woe to those who disbelieved - from the scene of a tremendous Day. How [clearly] they will hear and see the Day they come to Us, but the wrongdoers today are in clear error.""  In the Qur´an there are a lot of miracles of Jesus. All prophets had miracles, not only Jesus. All prophets had miracles through God´ help. And yes it´s true that Jesus does´nt have a father. But Adam has no father and no mother. So can we say Adam is God? NO!! And we can not say that Jesus is Son of God, because he has no father.  Another problem: In the bible we can see, that Jesus prayed God. But a lot of christians pray Jesus. xd Lets look  in the bible HOW Jesus and another prophets pray.  1) Psalms 95:6  O come, let us give worship, falling down on our knees before the Lord our Maker.  2)And he said, No; but I have come as captain of the armies of the Lord. Then Joshua, falling down with his face to the earth in worship, said, What has my lord to say to his servant? Joshua 5:14   3)Mark 14:35 ^ And he(Jesus) went forward a little, and falling down on the earth, made request that, if possible, the hour might go from him  4)Genesis 17:3 ^ And Abram went down on his face on the earth, and the Lord God went on talking with him, and said,..  So i can give you another many verses of bible about praying to God. But my questions. Why christians pray Jesus and not God? In the bible you see that Jesus prayed God. And HOW he prayed? ""Falling down with his face to the earth"" ""knees befor the Lord"". So why don´t christians pray as like Jesus or the prophets? That shows that the christianity today is not the real religion of Jesus. And which people accept Jesus and the prophets and pray like Jesus and the prophets? Thats the Muslims. Look the praying of muslims and the praying of Jesus and the prophets. And you will see thats the same :)  http://i.milliyet.com.tr/YeniAnaResim/2013/10/13/fft99_mf3686015.Jpeg  But one day you will die, too. And you will see that Jesus is truth and all prophets are truth and the Qur´an is the last message and Mohammed the last prophet.

2014-03-14T23:44:22,"This is not CHRIST this is Cesare Borgia.  Jesus is not the Messiah's name. There are no J's in the Hebrew Alphabet. The letter J wasn't even Invented until the 1600s. The first 1611 King James Bible didn't have the name ""Jesus"" in it but Iesous. Then once they took out the Book of Enoch and the Apocrypha they switched the name Iesous with Jesus. Iesous is GREEK spelling of the messiah's name and Zeus was a God(Fallen Angel also known as Jupiter) worshiped in GREEK Mythology. That's no coincidence. It's also no coincidence that Jesus, Iesous, Zeus are all corresponding related words. Jesus is Esoteric for Zeus. No where in the Bible did God authorize MAN to ""translate"" or change the messiah's name(Yeshua) which means God is Salvation(God is our Savior).  Joseph and Mary never gave birth to the Son of God. They gave birth to a Prophet named Immanuel. And humans switched his name to make it look like Christ was a Physical Human being when really he was an Extraterrestrial.  Isaiah 7:14 - Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  How can a Virgin be pregnant? Does that make ANY sense? They switched the word Virgin with Almah. Almah in Hebrew means Young Woman so really a Young Woman gave birth to a boy named Immanuel.  Where is ""Jesus"" childhood in the Bible? You can't find it anywhere and no it's not in Luke 2:40 that is clearly talking about Immanuel not Christ. The reason his childhood or teenage pre-adult hood isn't in the Bible and he goes from being a BABY to a GROWN MAN so fast is because he was never a PHYSICAL human being he was an Extraterrestrial. Which is why he could do the things he did, he was HEAVENLY SENT. Humans manipulated the Bible to HIDE this.  Christ was REALLY born in Heaven not Earth. Read Revelations 12:1-6 which talks about the birth of the Son of God in Heaven. This is how the War began in Heaven when the Devil went after Gods Throne. There's a KEYWORD in this verse that says the woman(who gave birth to Christ) was prepared for safety for about 1,200 days which means the war must of took on for that long. Which means there's MORE to what REALLY HAPPENED than what this scripture talks about(because most people will assume it happened in just one day).  No wonder there was once Life on Mars and there are abandoned planets in Space. It all goes back to the past life. The Planets in Space such as Neptunes, Venus, Mars, Jupiter(Zeus) etc are Fallen Angel Planets. It all goes back to the past life when everything was Aligned before Lucifer fell as an Angel. This is why God sent his Son. God didn't send his ""Biological Son"" he sent his SON as in his SUN meaning his LIGHT to LIFE. The word Sun comes from the Old English word Sunne. Just like the word Son comes from the old German word Sonne. Sonne is also Sunne in Middle High German. German is older than the English Language which proves my point, they're both corresponding words.  John 8:12 - Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the LIGHT of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in DARKNESS, but shall have the LIGHT of LIFE  The Sun here on Earth as we know it is the LIGHT of LIFE.  Christ was a LIGHT(Extraterrestrial) that descended from Heaven during the Dark Ages after Lucifer fell as an Angel not a Physical Human Being. PROOF  John 6:38 - For I came DOWN from HEAVEN, not to do mine OWN will, but the will of HIM that sent me.  John 3:17 - For God sent not his Son INTO the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  When the Son of God was telling them they don't have to walk in Darkness he was dealing with the people in the PAST LIFE after Lucifer fell as an Angel during the Dark Ages. The Bible is a book that deals with the PAST LIFE. Egypt is a Structured Symbol from the PAST LIFE. Egypt was the ""Underworld"" V that Lucifer reigned over in the past life that merged with Atlantis ^(God). Before he fell as an Angel.  If you look on the back of your ""ONE"" dollar bill you will see 11:11 SUBLIMINALLY. 11:11 is a Whole Number which consist of Negatives and Positives. One Eleven belongs to God. One Eleven belongs to the Devil. It all goes back to the PAST LIFE when we were all ""one"". Which is why you see the Egyptian Pyramid. The Pyramid is actually a Diamond built into specs from Top ^ to Bottom V. merging together as ""one"" forming a Diamond. It all goes back to the past life when we were all ""one"". Before Lucifer fell as an Angel.  Watch Michael Jackson's video ""Remember the Time"" you will see the Sand Timer in the Beginning of the video this is where the ""As it is Above, so it is Below"" concept comes from. When Atlantis ^ merged with Egypt(The Underworld). How funny Michael Jackson went into the past life in Egypt in his video ""Remember the time"" and there's an ACTUAL statue of Michael Jackson from past life Egypt. Don't believe me, look it up ""Ancient Egyptian Statue Michael Jackson"". He appears as an Alien/Angel to the Egyptians through-out the entire video. He was Incarnated Archangel Michael.  Yes the Egyptians and Hebrews WERE Black. Egypt itself means Kemet which means Black and Fertile land. Yes the Hebrews WERE Black. Read Deuteronomy 28:68 as well as Genesis 15:13 our Black History is right there in the Bible. No where in History did ""Jewish"" people go into Slavery with Ships.  Like I said, the Bible deals with the PAST LIFE. Everything is already written, which is why we experience Dejavu because it ALREADY HAPPENED. Read Jeremiah 29:11 which proves my point that everything is already written. How else do you think the Bible was able to prophecy what's going to happen? Because it's ALREADY WRITTEN.  The true teachings of Christ have been Distorted. Humans have manipulated and altered the Bible and have deceived the world with Christianity which is a Esoteric Pagan Religion.  The word 'Amen"" is a ERROR ""translated""(inserted) word from the Hebrew word Omein. Amen is Esoteric for Amon which is why you hear some people pronounce it ""Amon"" instead of Amen. Amon(RA) was an Egyptian God deity so when you say Amen/Amon you are honoring the Egyptian God deity Amon. No where in the Bible does it say it is Mandatory to use the word Amen after Prayer.  The word Easter was switched with the word Passover. Easter is a pagan ritual that comes from the Goddess of Ishtar and Fertility(Bunnies do not lay Eggs).  Christ wasn't born on December 25th, Nimrod was. Christmas is also a pagan holiday. Santa is really Satan and his little Elves are his Demons. How did they get the name Satan Claws oops I mean Santa Clause* from Old Saint Nick anyways? The five pointed star on the top of the Tree is the Goat Head and when you open your Gifts you subliminally BOW to the Tree. It's all Satanic. The Bible tells you not to put a tree in your house anyways.  Study the Torah & Tanakh and you'll see how humans have manipulated the Bible.  God is our Savior not ""Jesus"" GOD is the one who chose to send his Son so that the world could be saved, his Son didn't SEND himself. Again  John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 6:38 - For I came DOWN from HEAVEN, not to do mine OWN will, but the will of HIM that sent me.  There is only One God and that is the Most High.  1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,  Isaiah 44:6 - Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.  Isaiah 43:11 - I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no savior.  John 10:30 - I and the Father are one.”  You really think God was some blonde hair blue eyed white guy(Cesare Borgia) in a Dress and and some Flip Flops who sounds like Shakespeare?  ""Woe, Unto Thee, For I say, Shall, Behold!' come on people. God is an Advanced Alien which is why your Luciferian Government has been preparing you all for what is yet to come with all these Deceptive Alien movies such as War of the Worlds.

In these days when humanity has become so immersed in the materiel world and grasping, and has become cynical about hopefulness amidst the violence and hatred in this world, this film opens our experience to the person of Jesus described in the Gospel. I am grateful to Christopher Spencer and Roma Downey for allowing Divine Grace to guide them to make this film, which I am sure will inspire people to come to know and love the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

The God's word warned us in Revelations how the devil is going to deceive many people with his false trinity where he ""acts"" as the father, the antichrist acts as the son, and the false prophet acts as the holy spirit, and thats exactly what he is doing now, working through each and every last one of you causing you to persecute God, my heavenly father, and my Lord and savior Jesus Christ.

May peace, love, and grace for every one of you may be contained throughout all the days of your lives friends. I only wish for you to turn from your evil ways and come to God before its everlasting to late. Lastly, the Bible says in Romans 14:11 ""For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God"". So for all of those who blasphemy my Father and my Lord, those who don't believe, those who reject him, each and every one of you(including we his children), in the end at judgement day, Jesus will separate the sheeps(God's children) from the goats(satans servants)although some will go to hell and others will go to Heaven, we all will get down on BOTH kness in front of our Lord and confess to God our Father. This is why I'm here friends, to spread the Gospel and good news with each of you, I don't want none of you to go to hell guys I LOVE YOU, and so does God my Father.

2014-03-20T11:53:56,"I do not disagree that Jesus is the Germanic name that is far fetched from Iesus in Latin of which is from Roman consolidated scripture.   Iesus of course is from Yahushua, aka Joshua in English.  That is the true name of our Messiah.    In regards to Jesus being Zeus.  As a very long time researcher in Christian history, I noticed that the drawings on mosaics from the 2nd Century A.D, the depiction of Jesus was closer to Zeus with masculinity, bearded and strong as the pagans depicted Zeus/Jupiter in the Roman empire of which is one and the same pagan god.  So the depiction of Jesus continues from Jupiter's pagan looks and continues through the ages.  This is due to the unknown image of how Christ really looked like and the widespread mental ideology of new pagan converts.  They tend to view Jesus like their old gods.  This was further exacerbated under Constantine I when the pagans would bring idols into churches and there sprung the Roman Catholic Church with her other doctrines and deities.  Next, it is not untrue that Jesus in the modern world bears significance to Cesare Borgia of whom Jesus was painted in the image of Cesare, of whom was an unscrupulous and evil Italian state prince during the Renaissance.    Therefore, a lot of our perceptions of Jesus is wrong and we need to cut out these visual occult imagery.  The only way to Jesus is by faith.  Remember St Paul and then re emphasized by Martin Luther that we are justified by faith alone?  Therfore if you have faith in Jesus, if you believe all of his teachings and follow his Words, and pursue and prioritize Jesus first place in our lives as God, we are saved and will enjoy relationship with our loving Father.  The rest about seeking prosperity and healing is just secondary and should never come first place to seeking the Lord.  Please do not fall into the trap of modern day Christianity of humanism.  ",1,1,Constantine Joseph,WcIXCok9HPg,0.04208699902248289,2014-03-20 11:53:56,False,True

2014-03-22T15:05:26,"This is not CHRIST this is Cesare Borgia.  Jesus is not the Messiah's name. There are no J's in the Hebrew Alphabet. The letter J wasn't even Invented until the 1600s. The first 1611 King James Bible didn't have the name ""Jesus"" in it but Iesous. Then once they took out the Book of Enoch and the Apocrypha they switched the name Iesous with Jesus. Iesous is GREEK spelling of the messiah's name and Zeus was a God(Fallen Angel also known as Jupiter) worshiped in GREEK Mythology. That's no coincidence. It's also no coincidence that Jesus, Iesous, Zeus are all corresponding related words. Jesus is Esoteric for Zeus. No where in the Bible did God authorize MAN to ""translate"" or change the messiah's name(Yeshua) which means God is Salvation(God is our Savior).  Joseph and Mary never gave birth to the Son of God. They gave birth to a Prophet named Immanuel. And humans switched his name to make it look like Christ was a Physical Human being when really he was an Extraterrestrial.  Isaiah 7:14 - Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  How can a Virgin be pregnant? Does that make ANY sense? They switched the word Virgin with Almah. Almah in Hebrew means Young Woman so really a Young Woman gave birth to a boy named Immanuel.  Where is ""Jesus"" childhood in the Bible? You can't find it anywhere and no it's not in Luke 2:40 that is clearly talking about Immanuel not Christ. The reason his childhood or teenage pre-adult hood isn't in the Bible and he goes from being a BABY to a GROWN MAN so fast is because he was never a PHYSICAL human being he was an Extraterrestrial. Which is why he could do the things he did, he was HEAVENLY SENT. Humans manipulated the Bible to HIDE this.  Christ was REALLY born in Heaven not Earth. Read Revelations 12:1-6 which talks about the birth of the Son of God in Heaven. This is how the War began in Heaven when the Devil went after Gods Throne. There's a KEYWORD in this verse that says the woman(who gave birth to Christ) was prepared for safety for about 1,200 days which means the war must of took on for that long. Which means there's MORE to what REALLY HAPPENED than what this scripture talks about(because most people will assume it happened in just one day).  No wonder there was once Life on Mars and there are abandoned planets in Space. It all goes back to the past life. The Planets in Space such as Neptunes, Venus, Mars, Jupiter(Zeus) etc are Fallen Angel Planets. It all goes back to the past life when everything was Aligned before Lucifer fell as an Angel. This is why God sent his Son. God didn't send his ""Biological Son"" he sent his SON as in his SUN meaning his LIGHT to LIFE. The word Sun comes from the Old English word Sunne. Just like the word Son comes from the old German word Sonne. Sonne is also Sunne in Middle High German. German is older than the English Language which proves my point, they're both corresponding words.  John 8:12 - Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the LIGHT of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in DARKNESS, but shall have the LIGHT of LIFE  The Sun here on Earth as we know it is the LIGHT of LIFE.  Christ was a LIGHT(Extraterrestrial) that descended from Heaven during the Dark Ages after Lucifer fell as an Angel not a Physical Human Being. PROOF  John 6:38 - For I came DOWN from HEAVEN, not to do mine OWN will, but the will of HIM that sent me.  John 3:17 - For God sent not his Son INTO the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  When the Son of God was telling them they don't have to walk in Darkness he was dealing with the people in the PAST LIFE after Lucifer fell as an Angel during the Dark Ages. The Bible is a book that deals with the PAST LIFE. Egypt is a Structured Symbol from the PAST LIFE. Egypt was the ""Underworld"" V that Lucifer reigned over in the past life that merged with Atlantis ^(God). Before he fell as an Angel.  If you look on the back of your ""ONE"" dollar bill you will see 11:11 SUBLIMINALLY. 11:11 is a Whole Number which consist of Negatives and Positives. One Eleven belongs to God. One Eleven belongs to the Devil. It all goes back to the PAST LIFE when we were all ""one"". Which is why you see the Egyptian Pyramid. The Pyramid is actually a Diamond built into specs from Top ^ to Bottom V. merging together as ""one"" forming a Diamond. It all goes back to the past life when we were all ""one"". Before Lucifer fell as an Angel.  Watch Michael Jackson's video ""Remember the Time"" you will see the Sand Timer in the Beginning of the video this is where the ""As it is Above, so it is Below"" concept comes from. When Atlantis ^ merged with Egypt(The Underworld). How funny Michael Jackson went into the past life in Egypt in his video ""Remember the time"" and there's an ACTUAL statue of Michael Jackson from past life Egypt. Don't believe me, look it up ""Ancient Egyptian Statue Michael Jackson"". He appears as an Alien/Angel to the Egyptians through-out the entire video. He was Incarnated Archangel Michael.  Yes the Egyptians and Hebrews WERE Black. Egypt itself means Kemet which means Black and Fertile land. Yes the Hebrews WERE Black. Read Deuteronomy 28:68 as well as Genesis 15:13 our Black History is right there in the Bible. No where in History did ""Jewish"" people go into Slavery with Ships.  Like I said, the Bible deals with the PAST LIFE. Everything is already written, which is why we experience Dejavu because it ALREADY HAPPENED. Read Jeremiah 29:11 which proves my point that everything is already written. How else do you think the Bible was able to prophecy what's going to happen? Because it's ALREADY WRITTEN.  The true teachings of Christ have been Distorted. Humans have manipulated and altered the Bible and have deceived the world with Christianity which is a Esoteric Pagan Religion.  The word 'Amen"" is a ERROR ""translated""(inserted) word from the Hebrew word Omein. Amen is Esoteric for Amon which is why you hear some people pronounce it ""Amon"" instead of Amen. Amon(RA) was an Egyptian God deity so when you say Amen/Amon you are honoring the Egyptian God deity Amon. No where in the Bible does it say it is Mandatory to use the word Amen after Prayer.  The word Easter was switched with the word Passover. Easter is a pagan ritual that comes from the Goddess of Ishtar and Fertility(Bunnies do not lay Eggs).  Christ wasn't born on December 25th, Nimrod was. Christmas is also a pagan holiday. Santa is really Satan and his little Elves are his Demons. How did they get the name Satan Claws oops I mean Santa Clause* from Old Saint Nick anyways? The five pointed star on the top of the Tree is the Goat Head and when you open your Gifts you subliminally BOW to the Tree. It's all Satanic. The Bible tells you not to put a tree in your house anyways.  Study the Torah & Tanakh and you'll see how humans have manipulated the Bible.  God is our Savior not ""Jesus"" GOD is the one who chose to send his Son so that the world could be saved, his Son didn't SEND himself. Again  John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 6:38 - For I came DOWN from HEAVEN, not to do mine OWN will, but the will of HIM that sent me.  There is only One God and that is the Most High.  1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,  Isaiah 44:6 - Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.  Isaiah 43:11 - I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no savior.  John 10:30 - I and the Father are one.”  You really think God was some blonde hair blue eyed white guy(Cesare Borgia) in a Dress and and some Flip Flops who sounds like Shakespeare?  ""Woe, Unto Thee, For I say, Shall, Behold!' come on people. God is an Advanced Alien which is why your Luciferian Government has been preparing you all for what is yet to come with all these Deceptive Alien movies such as War of the Worlds. The part where the Aliens come out of the Sky and start Zapping people and making them disappear is the Rapture and it's coming soon!﻿",10,5,iPromoTruth,WcIXCok9HPg,0.0683292423498609,2014-03-22 15:05:26,False,True

2014-03-22T22:31:24,"Drunk With Blood includes a separate account for each of God's 158 killings. These stories fill the pages of the Bible, yet they are seldom read in church and are ignored by most Bible believers, which is a shame because God is so proud of his killings: ""I kill ... I wound ... I will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh."" Deuteronomy 32:39-42 You've probably hear of a few of God's killings. Noah's Flood,Sodom and Gomorrah, David and Goliath, maybe. But there are over 150 others that are unknown to pretty much everyone, believer and nonbeliever alike. Did you know, for example, that God: *Forced friends and family to kill each other for dancing naked around Aaron's golden calf? *Burned Aaron's sons to death for offering him strange fire? *Burned complainers to death, forced the survivors to eat quail until it literally came out their noses, sent ""fiery serpents"" to bite people for complaining about the lack of food and water, and killed 14,700 for complaining about his killings? *Buried alive those that opposed Moses (along with their families)? *Burned 250 men to death for burning incense? *Rewarded Phinehas for throwing a spear though the bellies of an inter-tribal couple while they were having sex? *Ordered, assisted in, or approved of dozens of complete genocides? *Accepted human sacrifice in the cases of Jephthah's daughter and Saul's seven sons? *Helped Samson murder thirty men for their clothes, slaughter 1000 with the jawbone of an ass, and kill 3000 civilians in a a suicide terrorist attack? *Smote the Philistines of several cities with hemorrhoids in their secret parts? *Killed a man for trying to keep the ark of the covenant from falling and 50,070 for looking into the ark? *Approved when David bought his first wife with 200 Philistine foreskins? *Killed King Saul for not killing every Amalekite as he told him to do? *Slowly killed a baby to punish King David for committing adultery? *Killed 70,000 because David had a census that he (or Satan) told him to do? *Sent a lion to kill a prophet for believing another prophet's lie, another lion to kill a man for not smiting a prophet, and some more lions to kill people that didn't fear him enough? *Killed 450 religious leaders who lost a prayer contest with Elijah and burned 102 men to death for asking Elijah to come down from his hill? *Sent two bears to rip apart 42 boys for making fun of Elisha's bald head? *Killed 27,000 Syrians by having a wall fall on them, sent an angel to kill 185,000 sleeping soldiers, interfered in human battles to kill a half million Israelite and a million Ethiopian soldiers? *Killed King Ahab for not killing a captured king, and then sent King Jehu on a series of mass murders to kill all of Ahab's family and friends who had ever ""pissed against a wall?"" *Killed Jehoram by making his bowels fall out? *Killed Job's ten children in a bet with Satan? *Killed Ezekiel's wife and told him not to mourn her? *Killed Ananias and Sapphira for not giving Peter all their money? *Killed King Herod by feeding him to worms?

2014-03-23T01:25:54,"This figure that majority of the world portray to be Son of GOD is nothing but an illusion. The people need to create an image so they can convince the world of an existence as to where we and the other unexplained have derived. Why depict him as a white accented man ? How does that bring about the true meaning of God? How would other races understand the true concept of God if they show him as a dominant white raced person? There is where other religions will be created to suit how these people see themselves and how they want their creator to be someone who is like them that will not judge nor condemn how they appear.  There was a Son of God. Yes, this is true because we are all apart of God. His children. And most of the consequences we meet here is because we already inflicted these consequences among us, it is just inevitable. How I see this whole God sent his son thing is that God gave a man knowledge. All the knowledge that he had, in a sense the one referred to as ''Son'' was the first of everything to appear in a time where people were able to record and remember. The first doctor, philosopher, scientist, hippie, teacher, first person to oppose society just a man who knew what to put together to create an image that would make people be amazed by what unfolds in front of them.  The cases that were called miracles were just simply knowledge being expressed that no man at that time knew about. Say for instance a scientist we have today was in those days the knowledge he knew would make him appear as if he is some kind of deity to the people that knows nothing. And how would this scientist know? He would know because he already did experiments to prove what he now practices. Even in todays world as modern as it is there isn't a day that pass and we do not learn something new that makes us go into a state of shock or doubt.  This man came from experience and the experience he had was given to him so that he was able to come back and express it towards the people. Even we as humans have that. We have instincts that would tell us the outcome of a situations before it happens. And why is this? Because we already have experience. We were all born with what we already know but just that as we grow we realize it in more depth.  Majority of the religions are stained with false information and the only way we can truly know is to gain our own experience. Seek our own paths to find what we need to know not just swallow what they give to us. How would we know what we are doing is right. Why would God give to us what he can not handle in other words why would he give us choices if he will send us in a pit of eternal fire if he gave us a choice? Some religions teach us to fear God because if we do not do what is right when in reality its a form of mind control. Do what we say to keep the order. If God was this no tolerant man there wouldn't be choices there would be absolute or as we say perfection and what good is perfection? It takes away the whole concept of living and learning for if it was one decision there would not be different paths everyone would be the same way. Square and unoriginal.   What you dont realize is that we as a people created our own image of what a God was or is. Once someone/something appears and stands on firm ground with what ever they do, believe in it to the fullest extent despite the oppression and accepts death gracefully without hesitation while still holding on to what they believe we honour that person forever because they stood unrooted and represented what others felt ashamed to do.

Phil:1:6.         That's a great verse for someone as truthful as I can be and vulnerable as I can be on youtube-yes I'm taking a risk but for Christ it is all worth it.  Everything is indeed a loss compared to living a life for Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit.  I am not the man I ought to be but thank God I'm not the man I used to be.",1,0,sean hancock,WcIXCok9HPg,0.28494623655913986,2014-03-23 20:47:51,False,True

Be as YOU are! None shall interfere or enforce you amongst your beliefs. But need I tell you this from the heart and out of love.... God is the anointed one and is the messiah who is coming again SOON. So when he comes–be prepared. When the world is corrupt enough and he returns and all that is recorded in the Book of Revelations has happened– do not be willing I change faith at the moment of God's Glory. You hear stories of miraculous dominion which have taken place. For example: A child was in attempt for allegedly suiciding himself and the radio changed stations... He today is a saved Christian; and he knows the truth of Christ. People on Family Guy mock Christ and deliberately scheme and blasphemy His name. There is Contemporary Christian music playing and all other references available so that you will not parish and you false believers and 'advocates' are so stubborn to at least think and do the littlest and look up at the creation and clouds moving as I did to test my faith and believe for a brief moment....

2014-03-26T23:42:22,"Not a very scripturally accurate video - obviously sponsored by those who wish to suppress the truth that the Last Supper was the true date for the hebrew passover, but the jews had already changed the laws to reduce the number of Holy Days which interfered with their money making schemes.  Luke 22:7 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. 8 Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.” 11 and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’ 12 He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.” 13 They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. 15 And he said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.  The video goes to great lengths to disguise the fact that the Last Supper was in fact the Passover as the 13th day of the month came to a close, they ate the Passover on the evening of the 14th after the sun had set.  Even unto this very day, the traditional jews keep Passover on the 15th after the 14th day sunset. Whilst the rest of the world doesn't even bother to keep any Passover meal as commanded even by Christ Himself when He said, Luke 22:19 And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”  Unfortunately, today the world is consumed by consumption and the mighty $. Humble servitude and obedience has given way to selfishness and pleasure, so people are more interested in bunny rabbits and easter eggs and other such foolish pagan rites and practises. Instead of celebrating the festival on the correct day, instead the people keep easter thursday, good friday, and easter sunday - which is convenient for the minimal disruption to the business world, whilst completely ignoring the Word of God.",2,1,delawarecop,WcIXCok9HPg,0.13431677018633542,2014-03-26 23:42:22,False,True

The book has  been translated but the teachings and context are still exactly the same. Anyone who doesn't believe in Jesus why come on here, keep it to your self. If you want to be saved, pray to him. Keep your muslim religion else where. Jesus taught love and respect and honor, he showed sacrifice and kindness. No other religion has that.  The order up until and after Jesus is clear. The Bible was written thousands of years ago, for you skeptics doubting it (note the quran came out hundreds of years after the Bible and after Jesus, note it's stories are similar and note it changes names and characters and stories. Muslims dominate Egypt and Palestine, as well as other Middle eastern countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan etc. They rage war on anyone who is against them, they kill and put fear into others, this is NOT the way of God, note that these areas were areas where God punished in the Bible such as Egypt for disbelieving in him, remember the Pharaohs? They would never accept God, and later would not accept Jesus even in Isreal some of them declined to believe. Without Jesus's sacrifice we would all be doomed. As God is pure and love, I know for a fact no one here can be that pure no matter how hard we try, so we need Jesus. This Quran, this is the book of evil, an opisite, an army the devil is gathering to come against Christs believers and to discieve people into believing in another god and not the true God the father and Jesus the Son. Remember what the Bible says about in the end how many will loose there faith and how people will follow false prophets and religions, it was written before the quran, it was prophisiszed. They wont want to here it because they have been so well tricked, but there religion is evil, they persecute there women, they scare there followers into never leaving, they promise them upon dying in the name of there god that they will receive virgins in heaven, do you really think in all heavens glory that it would need to offer such things as women?

But thats really not the point, critizing a great actor like Diogo Morgado because he is portuguese and doesnt have the proper look to portray Jesus is bullshit! First of all, portuguese people are some of the darkest people in Europe next to romanians and turkish people, we have the same blood, proved to be more arab than european. If you come to Portugal you will see this is a popular look, hell, when it comes to our men most of them if they choose to grow a beard they will all look like one of the apostles! So choosing a portuguese man to play the part was perfect he does have te right look, deal with it. Second of all, its not really the colour of Jesus that mattered, people!! he was an extraordinary man who carried a great message and changed people's life even if you are an atheist you should appreciate the story and be moved by it even if you dont believe in it. So if you ask me there was no better actor that could portray the purity and goodness in jesus like Diogo did, i couldnt care less about his skin colour, the story is believable! Its an amazing performance that very fiew actors could have pulled off, Im a portuguese woman with indonesian and mexican backround engaged to a black african man, so hey even if jesus was asian i couldnt care less it's all about the message!

2014-04-08T22:54:03," JESUS in the QURAN   The Islamic view of Jesus lies between two extremes. The Jews , who rejected Jesus as a Prophet of God, called him an impostor. The Christians, on the other hand, considered him to be the son of God and worship him as such. Islam considers Jesus to be one of the great prophets of God and respects him as much as Ibrahim (Abraham), Moses, and Mohammed. (Peace Be Upon Them) This is conformity with the Islamic view of the oneness of God, the oneness of Divine guidance, and the complementary role of the subsequent mission of God's messengers. The essence of Islam - willing submission to the will of God - was revealed to Adam, who was passed it on to his children. All following revelations to Noah, Ibrahim, Moses, Jesus, and finally Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Them) were conformity with that message, with some elaboration to define the revelation between man and God, man and man, man and instructions. Thus, any contradictions among revealed religions is viewed by Islam as a man-made element introduced into these religions. The position of Jesus in the three major religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - should not be an exception. Although the Quran does not present a detailed life-story of Jesus, it highlights the important aspects of his birth, his mission, his ascension to heaven, and passes judgements on the Christian beliefs concerning him. The Quranic account of Jesus starts with the conception of his mother, Mary, whose mother, the wife of Imran, vowed to dedicate her child to the service of God in the temple. When Mary became a woman, the Holy Spirit (the Archangel Gabriel) appeared to her as a man bringing her news of a son. We read the following dialogue in the Quran between Mary and the Angel: ""When the angel said, ""Mary, god gives you a good tidings of a Word from Him whose **** is messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, -high honoured shall he be in this world and the next, near stationed to God. He shall speak to men in the cradle, and of age, and righteous he shall be, ""lord"" said Mary ""How shall I have a son, seeing no mortal has touched me? ""Even so, he said ""God creates what He will"". When he decrees a thing He but say to it, ""Be"", and it is. (Al-Imran 3:45-47) In a chapter (Surah) entitled ""Maryam"" (Mary), the Quran tells us how Mary gave birth to her son, and how the Jesus accused her when she brought the child home: ""Then she brought the child to her folk, carrying him, and they said, ""Mary, you have surely committed a monstrous thing. Sister of Aaron, your father was not a wicked man, nor your mother a woman unchaste. Mary pointed to the child; but they said, 'Hoe shall we speak to one who still in the cradle, a little child. And he said, 'Lo, I am God's servant, God has given me the Book and made me a Prophet Blessed He has made me ,wherever/may be; and hi has enjoined me to prayer, and to give the alms so long as I live, and likewise to cherish my mother; He has not made me arrogant and wicked. Peace be upon me, the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I am raised up a live. ""Maryam 19:29-33) in the same chapter, following the above quotation, God assures Mohammed (PBUH) and through him the whole world, that what is told above is the TRUTH about Jesus (PBUH), although Christians might not accept it. Jesus is NOT the son of God: He was obviously enough, the son of Mary. The verses continue: ""That is Jesus, son of Mary, in word of truth, concerning which they are doubting. It is not for God to take a son unto Him. Glory be to Him, He nut says to it, 'Be, and it is. (Maryam 19:34-35) After this strong statement about the nature of Jesus, God directed Mohammed (PBUH) to call the Christians to worship the one God: ""Surely God is my God, and your God, so surely serve him. This is the straight path"". (Maryam 19:36) The rejection of the very idea of God having a son is restated later in the same chapter with even stronger words: ""And they say, The All-merciful has taken unto Himself a son. You have indeed advanced something hideous. As if the skies are about to burst, the earth to split asunder and its mountain to fall down in the utter ruin for that they have attributed to the All-merciful a son; and behaves not the All-merciful to take a son. None there in the heavens and earth but comes to the All-merciful as a servant"" (Maryam 19:88-93) The Quran recognizes the fact that Jesus had no human father, but this does not make him the son of God, or God himself. By this criterion, Adam would have been more entitled more entitled to be the son of God, because he had neither a father nor a mother, so the Quran draws attention to the miraculous creation of both in the following verses; "" truly the likeness of Jesus, in God's sight is as Adam's likeness; He created him of dust, then He said upon him, 'Be' and hi was. (Al-Imran 3:59) The Quran rejects the concept of Trinity God the Father, God the son, God the Holy Spirit - as strongly as it rejects the concept of Jesus as the son of God. This is because GOD IS ONE. Three cannot be one. The Quran addresses Christians in the following verses from the Surrah entitled ""An-Nisaa"" (The Women) People of the Book, do not go beyond the bounds in your religion, and say nought as to God but the Truth. The messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only the messenger of God, and his word (Fulfilment of his word (Fulfilment of His command, through the word ""Be"", for the creation of Jesus) that he committed to Mary, and a spirit originating from Him (was given life by God). So believe in God and His Messengers, and say not 'Three'. Refrain, better is for you. God is only one God. Glory be to him-that He should have a son! To Him belongs all that is in the Heavens and in the Earth; God suffices for a guardian. The Messiah will not disdain to be a servant of God, neither the Angels who are close to Him. Whosoever disdains to serve Him and walks proud, He will assuredly muster them to Him, all of them. As for the believers, who do deeds of righteousness, we will pay them their rewards in full, and He will give them more, of His bounty; as for them who disdain and walks proud, then He will punish with a severe punishment, and they shall not find for them, apart from God, a friend or helper."" (An-Nissa 4:171-173) The denial of Jesus's divinity (and. For the matter, of Mary's divinity) is presented in the Quran in the form of a dialogue, at the Day of Judgement, between the Almighty Jesus. All the Messengers and their nations will gather before God and He will ask the Messengers how they were received by their people and what they said to them. Among those who will be questioned is Jesus: ""And when God said, 'O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say unto men, ""Take me and my mother as gods, apart from God""? He said, 'To you be glory! It is not mine to say what I have no right to. If I indeed said it, you would have known it, knowing what is within my heart, though I do not know your knowledge; you know the things unseen. I only said to them what you did commands me: ""Serve God, my God and your God."" (Al-Maida 5-116) Given that the Quran denies the Trinity and the son ship of Jesus, what, according to the Quran, was the real mission of Jesus? The answer is that Jesus was a link in a long chain of Prophets and Messengers sent by God to various nations and societies whenever they needed guidance or deviated from his teachings of Moses and other Messengers. As he was miraculously supported by numerous miracles to prove that he was a Messengers from God. However, the majority of the Jews rejected his ministry. In another verse of the Quran, Jesus confirmed the validity of the Torah which was revealed to Moses, and also conveyed he glad tidings of a final Messenger who follow him: ""And when Jesus son of Mary said, 'Children of Israel, I am indeed the Messenger to you, confirming the Torah that is before me, and giving good tiding of a Messenger who shall be the praised one.""(As-Saff 61:6) Note that ""praised one"" is a translation of ""Ahmad"" - The Prophet Mohammed's ****. Careful study of the New Testament shows that Jesus refers to the same Prophet in John 14:16-17: ""And I will give you another Counsellor (ThProphet Mohammed). To be with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth."" The usual explanation of this Prophecy is that the counsellor referred to is the Holy Spirit, but this explanation is excluded by a previous verse in John: ""Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counsellor will not come to you."" The characteristics of this counsellor, as can be derived from the prophecy, are that he will stay forever with the believers, he will glorify Jesus; and he will speak that he hears form God. All four characteristics apply to the Prophet Mohammed. He came six centuries after Jesus. He came six centuries after Jesus. He came with a universal and everlasting message, fulfilling the prophecy that the counsellor will stay forever with the faithful. He glorified Jesus as a great Prophet. The Quran attributes to Jesus miracles not mentioned in the Bible's Old and New Testaments, as well as specific verses in the Quran show how the Prophet Mohammad is rejected by Jews and Christians out of prejudice and misunderstanding, rather that carefully study the Bible. It is a sad fact of history that not many are following the ""straight path"" to which people were called by Jesus. He was only followed by a few disciples inspired by God to support him. The non-believers plotted - as they would against Mohammed, six centuries later - to kill Jesus. But God had better plan for him and his followers, as the Quran tells us: ""And when Jesus perceived their unbelief, he said 'Who will be my helpers in the cause of God?The apostles said, 'we are Gods helpers. We believe in God; so bear witness of our submission God, we believe in that you have sent down, and we follow the Messenger. Inscribe us therefore with those who bear witness. 'And they devised, and God devised, and God devised, and God is the best of divisors. When God said, 'Jesus, I will take you to Me and will raise you to Me, and I will purify you (of the falsehoods) of those who do not believe. I will make your followers above the unbelievers till the Resurrection Day.""(Al-Imran 3:52-55) As the above verses indicate, Jesus was taken and raised to heaven. He was not crucified. It was certainly the plan of the enemies of Jesus to put him to death on the cross, but God saved him and someone else was crucified: ""And for their unbelief, and their uttering against Mary a grave false charge, and for their saying, 'We killed the messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messiah of God""…yet they did not slay him, neither crucified him, only a likeness of that was shown to them. Those who are at variance concerning him are surely in doubt the following of conjecture; and they did not kill him of certainty…no indeed; God raised him up to Him; God is Almighty, Allwise. There is not one of the people of the book but will assuredly believe him before his death, and on the Resurrection Day he will be a witness against them."" (An-Nissa 4:156-159) The Quran does not explain who was the person crucified instead of Jesus, nor elaborate on the Second Coming of Jesus. However, explanators of the Quran have always interpreted the last verse of the above quotation to mean that Jesus will believe in him before he dies. This understanding is supported by authentic sayings (Hadith) of the Prophet Mohammed may the peace and blessings of Allah him and upon all His Messengers",1,0,Ayoob Al-Omairi,WcIXCok9HPg,0.13078272005772007,2014-04-08 22:54:03,False,True

2014-04-11T02:05:53,"To the few Muslims who commented a while back: I mean to say this in the kindest way possible.  Note, the Torah is the first five books in the Bible. The Gospel is the New Testament and words about Jesus. Yes, it means OUR Gospel.  D23. 5:50, 10 AH.(From the Qur’an) ""And let the People of the Gospel JUDGE by what God has revealed in it. If any fail to judge by what God has revealed, they are licentious."" (Licentious means disregarding accepted rules.)  D24. 5:68-71, 10 AH. (From the Qur’an) ""O People of the Book! You are not (founded) on anything until you PERFORM the Torah and the Gospel, and what was revealed to you from your Lord.""  A2. The Family of `Imran (Ali `Imran) 3:48, 2-3 AH. (From the Qur’an) The Angel Gabriel is speaking to Mary about Jesus before Jesus' birth and says: ""And he (God) will teach him the book and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel""  5:46 (From the Qur’an) “And in their footsteps we sent Jesus the son of Mary confirming the Law that had come before him. We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law.”  And many many more.   But they believe that it was corrupted. Why would your God command you to observe a book He knew would be corrupted? The book is sound. You do believe that He is all-knowing. I have researched all of this. For your sake. I have always been Christian.   Also, your book states that the Gospel is from God. And that God’s words cannot be corrupted.   S. 6:115 Pickthall (From the Qur’an) The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfillment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all.  False Prophets will come. Yet you believe this False Prophet. So look carefully at his words. Even the devils acknowledge Jesus.  James 2:19 (From the Bible) You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder.  Acts 19:15 (From the Bible) 15. And the evil spirit answered and said to them, ""I recognize Jesus, and I know about Paul, but who are you?""  Luke 4:41 (From the Bible) 41. Demons also were coming out of many, shouting, ""You are the Son of God!"" But rebuking them, He would not allow them to speak, because they knew Him to be the Christ.  Luke 8:28 (From the Bible) ""What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!""  About False Prophets:  Mathew 7:15 (From the Bible)  15. ""Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.  Matthew 24:11 (From the Bible) and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.  Jeremiah 23:16 (From the Bible) This is what the LORD Almighty says: ""Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you; they fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.  This was to show that False Prophets often know Jesus’s name and use it to deceive people. But just in case you are going to conclude from this that it’s because of devils that people call Him that, I include this:  Mathew 16:16 (From the Bible) 16. Simon Peter answered, ""You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."" 17. And Jesus said to him, ""Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven.  It would not have been a blessed statement if it was not true.   And, I include this one, just to let you know God loves you. There are many parables He teaches about how those who come back to Him, or come to Him from the dead will be welcomed: If you are not in Christ you are dead.   John 13:34-35 (From the Bible) 34. “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. 35. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”  Feel free to ask me any questions.

2014-04-14T02:30:38,"This is not CHRIST this is CESARE BORGIA.  Christianity is a LIE. The True teachings of Christ have been Manipulated and Distorted by PAGANS and LUCIFERIANS.  Jesus is not the Messiah's name. There are no J's in the Hebrew Alphabet. The letter J wasn't even Invented until the 1600s. The first 1611 King James Bible didn't have the name ""Jesus"" in it but Iesous. Then once they took out the Book of Enoch and the Apocrypha they switched the name Iesous with Jesus. Iesous is GREEK spelling of the messiah's name and Zeus was a God(Fallen Angel also known as Jupiter) worshiped in GREEK Mythology. That's no coincidence. It's also no coincidence that Jesus, Iesous, Zeus are all corresponding related words. Jesus is Esoteric for Zeus. No where in the Bible did God authorize MAN to ""translate"" or change the messiah's name(Yeshua) which means God is Salvation(God is our Savior). You don't translate NAMES anyway but WORDS and their MEANINGS.  Joseph and Mary never gave birth to the Son of God. They gave birth to a Prophet named Immanuel. And humans switched his name to make it look like Christ was a Physical Human being when really he was an Extraterrestrial.  Isaiah 7:14 - Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  How can a Virgin be pregnant? Does that make ANY sense? They switched the word Virgin with Almah. Almah in Hebrew means Young Woman so really a Young Woman gave birth to a boy named Immanuel.  Where is ""Jesus"" childhood in the Bible? You can't find it anywhere and no it's not in Luke 2:40 that is clearly talking about Immanuel not Christ. The reason his childhood or teenage pre-adult hood isn't in the Bible and he goes from being a BABY to a GROWN MAN so fast is because he was never a PHYSICAL human being he was an Extraterrestrial. Which is why he could do the things he did, he was HEAVENLY SENT. Humans manipulated the Bible to HIDE this.  Christ was REALLY born in Heaven not Earth. Read Revelations 12:1-6 which talks about the birth of the Son of God in Heaven. This is how the War began in Heaven when the Devil went after Gods Throne. There's a KEYWORD in this verse that says the woman(who gave birth to Christ) was prepared for safety for about 1,200 days which means the war must of took on for that long. Which means there's MORE to what REALLY HAPPENED than what this scripture talks about(because most people will assume it happened in just one day).  No wonder there was once Life on Mars and there are abandoned planets in Space. It all goes back to the past life. The Planets in Space such as Neptunes, Venus, Mars, Jupiter(Zeus) etc are Fallen Angel Planets. It all goes back to the past life when everything was Aligned before Lucifer fell as an Angel. This is why God sent his Son. God didn't send his ""Biological Son"" he sent his SON as in his SUN meaning his LIGHT to LIFE. The word Sun comes from the Old English word Sunne. Just like the word Son comes from the old German word Sonne. Sonne is also Sunne in Middle High German. German is older than the English Language which proves my point, they're both corresponding words.  John 8:12 - Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the LIGHT of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in DARKNESS, but shall have the LIGHT of LIFE  The Sun here on Earth as we know it is the LIGHT of LIFE.  Christ was a LIGHT(Extraterrestrial) that descended from Heaven during the Dark Ages after Lucifer fell as an Angel not a Physical Human Being. PROOF  John 6:38 - For I came DOWN from HEAVEN, not to do mine OWN will, but the will of HIM that sent me.  John 3:17 - For God sent not his Son INTO the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  When the Son of God was telling them they don't have to walk in Darkness he was dealing with the people in the PAST LIFE after Lucifer fell as an Angel during the Dark Ages. The Bible is a book that deals with the PAST LIFE. Egypt is a Structured Symbol from the PAST LIFE. Egypt was the ""Underworld"" V that Lucifer reigned over in the past life that merged with Atlantis ^(God). Before he fell as an Angel.  If you look on the back of your ""ONE"" dollar bill you will see 11:11 SUBLIMINALLY. 11:11 is a Whole Number which consist of Negatives and Positives. One Eleven belongs to God. One Eleven belongs to the Devil. It all goes back to the PAST LIFE when we were all ""one"". Which is why you see the Egyptian Pyramid. The Pyramid is actually a Diamond built into specs from Top ^ to Bottom V. merging together as ""one"" forming a Diamond. It all goes back to the past life when we were all ""one"". Before Lucifer fell as an Angel.  Watch Michael Jackson's video ""Remember the Time"" you will see the Sand Timer in the Beginning of the video this is where the ""As it is Above, so it is Below"" concept comes from. When Atlantis ^ merged with Egypt(The Underworld). How funny Michael Jackson went into the past life in Egypt in his video ""Remember the time"" and there's an ACTUAL statue of Michael Jackson from past life Egypt. Don't believe me, look it up ""Ancient Egyptian Statue Michael Jackson"". He appears as an Alien/Angel to the Egyptians through-out the entire video. He was Incarnated Archangel Michael.  Yes the Egyptians and Hebrews WERE Black. Egypt itself means Kemet which means Black and Fertile land. Yes the Hebrews WERE Black. Read Deuteronomy 28:68 as well as Genesis 15:13 our Black History is right there in the Bible. No where in History did ""Jewish"" people go into Slavery with Ships.  Like I said, the Bible deals with the PAST LIFE. Everything is already written, which is why we experience Dejavu because it ALREADY HAPPENED. Read Jeremiah 29:11 which proves my point that everything is already written. How else do you think the Bible was able to prophecy what's going to happen? Because it's ALREADY WRITTEN.  The true teachings of Christ have been Distorted. Humans have manipulated and altered the Bible and have deceived the world with Christianity which is a Esoteric Pagan Religion.  The word 'Amen"" is a ERROR ""translated""(inserted) word from the Hebrew word Omein. Amen is Esoteric for Amon which is why you hear some people pronounce it ""Amon"" instead of Amen. Amon(RA) was an Egyptian God deity so when you say Amen/Amon you are honoring the Egyptian God deity Amon. No where in the Bible does it say it is Mandatory to use the word Amen after Prayer.  The word Easter was switched with the word Passover. Easter is a pagan ritual that comes from the Goddess of Ishtar and Fertility(Bunnies do not lay Eggs).  Christ wasn't born on December 25th, Nimrod was. Christmas is also a pagan holiday. Santa is really Satan and his little Elves are his Demons. How did they get the name Satan Claws oops I mean Santa Clause* from Old Saint Nick anyways? The five pointed star on the top of the Tree is the Goat Head and when you open your Gifts you subliminally BOW to the Tree. It's all Satanic. The Bible tells you not to put a tree in your house anyways.(Jeremiah 10:1-4)  Study the Torah & Tanakh and you'll see how humans have manipulated the Bible.  God is our Savior not ""Jesus"" GOD is the one who chose to send his Son so that the world could be saved, his Son didn't SEND himself. Again  John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 6:38 - For I came DOWN from HEAVEN, not to do mine OWN will, but the will of HIM that sent me.  There is only One God and that is the Most High.  1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,  Isaiah 44:6 - Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.  Isaiah 43:11 - I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no savior.  John 10:30 - I and the Father are one.”  You really think God was some blonde hair blue eyed white guy(Cesare Borgia) in a Dress and and some Flip Flops who sounds like Shakespeare?  ""Woe, Unto Thee, For I say, Shall, Behold!' come on people.

And, these “flipbooks” now include audio/sound, just like audio “books.”  Isn’t that what they are? The “movie” starts out on paper, written down as a story, then storyboards are made/drawn. Then the lifelike “paintings” begins, the recordings, the lit up “flipbook(s)”, which are now “painted” onto film, or now, digital media/storage devices. What a “neat” way to “read” a “book”, hands free, “read” out loud and bending/stooping in front of something in a “living room (There is an “altar” in todays “living rooms”, this term, from what I’ve “learned”, is mocking as well).” These “books”…..are better than “that book/tree/Branch (The Scripture/Word of Truth, Dan 10:21, Jas 1:18).” These “entertainment products/screens (and “actors”, pretenders)” are really “TOOLS” and FOOLS. The “pictures/paintings” delivered through/to all of them, distract, ensnare, deceive……..and mock……you….AND our Creator. “They” (Creator Hater, Illuminati/bankers of the world, satanists) have made “movies” using the various Names used to refer to Him, in titles of these “movies.” Here are some, if not all of them.  “The Words” (2012), “The Creator’s Game” (1999), “Creator” (1985), “In the Name of the Father” (1993), “Sins of the Father” (2002 “tv”), “FATHER-The Movie” (2012), “The Father’s Love” (2012), “The Father Effect” (2010), “Bruce Almighty” (2003), “Evan Almighty” (2007), “The Mighty” (1998), “The Maker” (1997), these last two mock very much, “The Maker (A ghastly looking “monster” plays this “Maker?” And, it’s all stop motion?)” (2011) and “Most High (This one “surprised” me immensly. A “movie” about being  VERY “high?”)” (2004). BUT, even though there have been “movies” made using those Names, which are quite a handful……..they are nothing compared to the list of “movies” using that three letter “name”…….G-O-D.  There is a site where someone compiled a “movie” list with this word/”name” in it, there’s over two hundred.  It’s “dog” spelled backwards for one thing. Another thing, that first “letter(symbol)” “hides” something.  Also of note, l-i-v-e-d , spelled backwards (Take out the “d”, as well (e-v-i-l). Also….sounds like “livid.”)?  “They” have NO PROBLEM with this “name.” “They’ll” capitalize it, make it stand out, put it on “money”, on “products”, use it in other words (goddard space center, godiva chocolates) etc., etc.  This “name”, rhymes with the second part of an Ibree/Hebrew word. Even though some of the “movies” listed above do mention some of what is written in His Books, that industry, deals with absolute covetousness/idolatry/pride: zoomania, technomania (manias/obsessions, paraphilias), phobias , ""isms"", VANITY…..AND GREED.  The book of Revelation is last for a reason, it “seems.” Revelation also means……an epiphany, a revealing/disclosure…….should you wonder why?

BECAUSE HE HAS DONE MANY WONDERS IN MY LIFE SINCE MY CHILDHOOD.  he saved my family from slaughtering riots in nigeria, when all our neighbours who were christians were burnt alive by extremist muslims.  HE RESCUED ME FROM my peril as a child when i knelt down and cried in tears and insane sorrow in pain, asking him to let me be with my mum who was not with me for YEARS.....and i was being maltreated by my relatives.

At first I thought it looked really good and would be an accurate description of Jesus and his life but NO, it portrays a NEW-AGE Jesus and the creators of the movie are occultists and believe in reincarnation and love of ones own self more than God and others etc. They also believe that humans are their own God so don't be deceived! I almost was until I did my research. It's disappointing I know, I really thought God would use a movie to attract more people to Christianity but God doesn't need to. The Bible is good enough for him and The Son of God movie is just a work of Satan. He can make bad things look good and wants to trick people as much as he can in the end times. The movie doesn't even mention sin or teaches that Jesus's died for our sins, it's about a new-age Jesus who came to teach people to love themselves. It also makes out that Jesus and Mary Magdeline  were in a relationship. This is TOTALLY FALSE!

Besides, this is a trailer about the Son of God, not a trailer about the other ""gods"" you're believing.

This film is made to recall the Son of God's sacrifice, a sacrifice no man can do. So just enjoy watching it, not worry about spending your money.  Jesus said, ""You can't worship God and money.""     PLEASE, just respect us. If you're gonna comment, don't be ignorant and don't comment about your ""gods"". I ASK YOU, IS THIS ANOTHER ""god""'s MOVIE??!!

Now, not only am I positive that God exists, but I know where God is. He is in all of us, with no discrimination. He loves us all equally, no matter who we are or what religion we practice. We are one. For more explanations in regards to my comments, read the book Unify. It was released this month. While writing the book, I used the Bible, Quran, and Torah in order to back up what I am saying in the book. I read those books on purpose because I do not want to mislead anyone. If anyone wants to prove me wrong, please read the book and I am willing, if I am wrong, to accept that I am wrong. I will give you your money back and I will apologize to you. In the book Unify, on page 120, it explains how Jesus says in John 14:19 how we are one and for the people who still believe Jesus will come back, I am not saying this, Jesus said it himself that the world will not see him anymore.. This is what he said ""Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me, Because I live, you will also live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you."" Please read your book like a logo with hidden images.

2014-04-30T22:09:52,"JESUS in the QURAN   The Islamic view of Jesus lies between two extremes. The Jews , who rejected Jesus as a Prophet of God, called him an impostor. The Christians, on the other hand, considered him to be the son of God and worship him as such. Islam considers Jesus to be one of the great prophets of God and respects him as much as Ibrahim (Abraham), Moses, and Mohammed. (Peace Be Upon Them) This is conformity with the Islamic view of the oneness of God, the oneness of Divine guidance, and the complementary role of the subsequent mission of God's messengers. The essence of Islam - willing submission to the will of God - was revealed to Adam, who was passed it on to his children. All following revelations to Noah, Ibrahim, Moses, Jesus, and finally Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Them) were conformity with that message, with some elaboration to define the revelation between man and God, man and man, man and instructions. Thus, any contradictions among revealed religions is viewed by Islam as a man-made element introduced into these religions. The position of Jesus in the three major religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - should not be an exception. Although the Quran does not present a detailed life-story of Jesus, it highlights the important aspects of his birth, his mission, his ascension to heaven, and passes judgements on the Christian beliefs concerning him. The Quranic account of Jesus starts with the conception of his mother, Mary, whose mother, the wife of Imran, vowed to dedicate her child to the service of God in the temple. When Mary became a woman, the Holy Spirit (the Archangel Gabriel) appeared to her as a man bringing her news of a son. We read the following dialogue in the Quran between Mary and the Angel: ""When the angel said, ""Mary, god gives you a good tidings of a Word from Him whose ** is messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, -high honoured shall he be in this world and the next, near stationed to God. He shall speak to men in the cradle, and of age, and righteous he shall be, ""lord"" said Mary ""How shall I have a son, seeing no mortal has touched me? ""Even so, he said ""God creates what He will"". When he decrees a thing He but say to it, ""Be"", and it is. (Al-Imran 3:45-47) In a chapter (Surah) entitled ""Maryam"" (Mary), the Quran tells us how Mary gave birth to her son, and how the Jesus accused her when she brought the child home: ""Then she brought the child to her folk, carrying him, and they said, ""Mary, you have surely committed a monstrous thing. Sister of Aaron, your father was not a wicked man, nor your mother a woman unchaste. Mary pointed to the child; but they said, 'Hoe shall we speak to one who still in the cradle, a little child. And he said, 'Lo, I am God's servant, God has given me the Book and made me a Prophet Blessed He has made me ,wherever/may be; and hi has enjoined me to prayer, and to give the alms so long as I live, and likewise to cherish my mother; He has not made me arrogant and wicked. Peace be upon me, the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I am raised up a live. ""Maryam 19:29-33) in the same chapter, following the above quotation, God assures Mohammed (PBUH) and through him the whole world, that what is told above is the TRUTH about Jesus (PBUH), although Christians might not accept it. Jesus is NOT the son of God: He was obviously enough, the son of Mary. The verses continue: ""That is Jesus, son of Mary, in word of truth, concerning which they are doubting. It is not for God to take a son unto Him. Glory be to Him, He nut says to it, 'Be, and it is. (Maryam 19:34-35) After this strong statement about the nature of Jesus, God directed Mohammed (PBUH) to call the Christians to worship the one God: ""Surely God is my God, and your God, so surely serve him. This is the straight path"". (Maryam 19:36) The rejection of the very idea of God having a son is restated later in the same chapter with even stronger words: ""And they say, The All-merciful has taken unto Himself a son. You have indeed advanced something hideous. As if the skies are about to burst, the earth to split asunder and its mountain to fall down in the utter ruin for that they have attributed to the All-merciful a son; and behaves not the All-merciful to take a son. None there in the heavens and earth but comes to the All-merciful as a servant"" (Maryam 19:88-93) The Quran recognizes the fact that Jesus had no human father, but this does not make him the son of God, or God himself. By this criterion, Adam would have been more entitled more entitled to be the son of God, because he had neither a father nor a mother, so the Quran draws attention to the miraculous creation of both in the following verses; "" truly the likeness of Jesus, in God's sight is as Adam's likeness; He created him of dust, then He said upon him, 'Be' and hi was. (Al-Imran 3:59) The Quran rejects the concept of Trinity God the Father, God the son, God the Holy Spirit - as strongly as it rejects the concept of Jesus as the son of God. This is because GOD IS ONE. Three cannot be one. The Quran addresses Christians in the following verses from the Surrah entitled ""An-Nisaa"" (The Women) People of the Book, do not go beyond the bounds in your religion, and say nought as to God but the Truth. The messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only the messenger of God, and his word (Fulfilment of his word (Fulfilment of His command, through the word ""Be"", for the creation of Jesus) that he committed to Mary, and a spirit originating from Him (was given life by God). So believe in God and His Messengers, and say not 'Three'. Refrain, better is for you. God is only one God. Glory be to him-that He should have a son! To Him belongs all that is in the Heavens and in the Earth; God suffices for a guardian. The Messiah will not disdain to be a servant of God, neither the Angels who are close to Him. Whosoever disdains to serve Him and walks proud, He will assuredly muster them to Him, all of them. As for the believers, who do deeds of righteousness, we will pay them their rewards in full, and He will give them more, of His bounty; as for them who disdain and walks proud, then He will punish with a severe punishment, and they shall not find for them, apart from God, a friend or helper."" (An-Nissa 4:171-173) The denial of Jesus's divinity (and. For the matter, of Mary's divinity) is presented in the Quran in the form of a dialogue, at the Day of Judgement, between the Almighty Jesus. All the Messengers and their nations will gather before God and He will ask the Messengers how they were received by their people and what they said to them. Among those who will be questioned is Jesus: ""And when God said, 'O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say unto men, ""Take me and my mother as gods, apart from God""? He said, 'To you be glory! It is not mine to say what I have no right to. If I indeed said it, you would have known it, knowing what is within my heart, though I do not know your knowledge; you know the things unseen. I only said to them what you did commands me: ""Serve God, my God and your God."" (Al-Maida 5-116) Given that the Quran denies the Trinity and the son ship of Jesus, what, according to the Quran, was the real mission of Jesus? The answer is that Jesus was a link in a long chain of Prophets and Messengers sent by God to various nations and societies whenever they needed guidance or deviated from his teachings of Moses and other Messengers. As he was miraculously supported by numerous miracles to prove that he was a Messengers from God. However, the majority of the Jews rejected his ministry. In another verse of the Quran, Jesus confirmed the validity of the Torah which was revealed to Moses, and also conveyed he glad tidings of a final Messenger who follow him: ""And when Jesus son of Mary said, 'Children of Israel, I am indeed the Messenger to you, confirming the Torah that is before me, and giving good tiding of a Messenger who shall be the praised one.""(As-Saff 61:6) Note that ""praised one"" is a translation of ""Ahmad"" - The Prophet Mohammed's **. Careful study of the New Testament shows that Jesus refers to the same Prophet in John 14:16-17: ""And I will give you another Counsellor (ThProphet Mohammed). To be with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth."" The usual explanation of this Prophecy is that the counsellor referred to is the Holy Spirit, but this explanation is excluded by a previous verse in John: ""Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counsellor will not come to you."" The characteristics of this counsellor, as can be derived from the prophecy, are that he will stay forever with the believers, he will glorify Jesus; and he will speak that he hears form God. All four characteristics apply to the Prophet Mohammed. He came six centuries after Jesus. He came six centuries after Jesus. He came with a universal and everlasting message, fulfilling the prophecy that the counsellor will stay forever with the faithful. He glorified Jesus as a great Prophet. The Quran attributes to Jesus miracles not mentioned in the Bible's Old and New Testaments, as well as specific verses in the Quran show how the Prophet Mohammad is rejected by Jews and Christians out of prejudice and misunderstanding, rather that carefully study the Bible. It is a sad fact of history that not many are following the ""straight path"" to which people were called by Jesus. He was only followed by a few disciples inspired by God to support him. The non-believers plotted - as they would against Mohammed, six centuries later - to kill Jesus. But God had better plan for him and his followers, as the Quran tells us: ""And when Jesus perceived their unbelief, he said 'Who will be my helpers in the cause of God?The apostles said, 'we are Gods helpers. We believe in God; so bear witness of our submission God, we believe in that you have sent down, and we follow the Messenger. Inscribe us therefore with those who bear witness. 'And they devised, and God devised, and God devised, and God is the best of divisors. When God said, 'Jesus, I will take you to Me and will raise you to Me, and I will purify you (of the falsehoods) of those who do not believe. I will make your followers above the unbelievers till the Resurrection Day.""(Al-Imran 3:52-55) As the above verses indicate, Jesus was taken and raised to heaven. He was not crucified. It was certainly the plan of the enemies of Jesus to put him to death on the cross, but God saved him and someone else was crucified: ""And for their unbelief, and their uttering against Mary a grave false charge, and for their saying, 'We killed the messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messiah of God""…yet they did not slay him, neither crucified him, only a likeness of that was shown to them. Those who are at variance concerning him are surely in doubt the following of conjecture; and they did not kill him of certainty…no indeed; God raised him up to Him; God is Almighty, Allwise. There is not one of the people of the book but will assuredly believe him before his death, and on the Resurrection Day he will be a witness against them."" (An-Nissa 4:156-159) The Quran does not explain who was the person crucified instead of Jesus, nor elaborate on the Second Coming of Jesus. However, explanators of the Quran have always interpreted the last verse of the above quotation to mean that Jesus will believe in him before he dies. This understanding is supported by authentic sayings (Hadith) of the Prophet Mohammed may the peace and blessings of Allah him and upon all His Messengers",0,0,Ayoob Al-Omairi,WcIXCok9HPg,0.13078272005772007,2014-04-30 22:09:52,False,True

In the real Bible, Jesus doesn't beg anyone to spend time with them. After all, He is the Lord and has all authority to command who He wants and what He wants. Therefore, He commands Peter and Andrew to follow Him and they immediately leave their boat and nets and obey Jesus' command. Just as all the Apostles who were commissioned by Christ to go into all the world and make disciples, that is, learners. He didn't tell anyone that He came to ""change the world"" nor did He ask for their help to do so. SERIOUSLY?  Christ came into the world to save sinners from the righteous wrath of God, which is the just penalty for our sins. He never said He came to change the world. He said He came to transform people by giving them new hearts and new minds through repentance and faith in Christ alone.  ""What are we going to do?"" dramatically says -- ""We're going to CHANGE the world...""  *rolls eyes*  I believe in the real Christ, not some pretty boy, british potato nosed Caucasian wishing to make the one true Son of the most high LIVING God a mythological shmuke who is no different than those of the false Greek god's. Why hollywood, why do you do this? If anything Jesus wasn't even what we considered to be attractive, didn't have long hair, or had white skin. HE WAS A JEW. Wow.

2014-05-19T18:01:47,"Hey, here is some food for thought. What if Science and Religion work together, mixed up into Spirituality? Don't get me wrong, I'm not speaking of Scientology, for me that's total BS. Science probably hasn't yet advanced enough to show us our Soul with a picture, if it ever will. And since, we live in a Capitalist world, I don't think it would be wise to show these proofs, the real proofs of our creation, which are backed up by our Governments and the biggest companies and organizations around the globe. The money at risk is basically the whole Capitalist system.  I will not ask you to try anything or read anything. These are my own questions which I am sharing with you. You will not change my thoughts, although I like hearing other peoples point of view.  Picture this, a world without any type of religion. Who will govern? You prefer a human, which we all know is greedy and selfish from birth? Everyone having a lack of faith in something better than just life and death. Would kids be joyful knowing that when they die they just get stuck in the ground or burned and thats the end of it?  I do not like when people say, GOD does not exist BECAUSE bad things happen. Thats just lack of trying to find another excuse, try harder.  Imagine for a second that GOD is eternity, infinity, the UNIVERSE as we know it. Now go to Science. Imagine GOD as an infinite amount of ENERGY, might as well call it LIGHT. So powerful we cannot begin to describe it other than just call it GOD. Now go to religion. JESUS as a great amount of that same ENERGY brought to our world, EARTH, in a simple human vessel. Just to show us what the example of PERFECTION is. Because JESUS was, indeed perfect as the writings describe him, I was not there. Now the catch. We are but a small amount of that same ENERGY in a simple human vessel. As the writings say, GOD blew us into a mud ""mould"". What if he passes on that ENERGY to our ""mould"" and life begins.  With life, there is death, as we know it. What if at death, our SOUL or ENERGY as I have described, goes back to its original place, GOD, the UNIVERSE, thus completing the RELIGIONS, SPIRITUALITY and SCIENCE terms. In Science as we have proven over time, ""ENERGY CANNOT BE CREATED OR DESTROYED"".  As I stated, these are my thoughts, I have only read some pages of each religion. As soon as I had control over my beliefs, ( was forced into the Catholic religion as a kid, never liked hearing a HUMAN read a writing and telling me what HE believes it says, I prefer to think myself. ), I started looking at the similarities in the different point of views in each RELIGION, including ATHEISTS, which actually is a RELIGION. As RELIGION is just a way of life, what your principles and actions are based on.  We can never be truly RATIONAL because we each have our own beliefs and thoughts. But I do like hearing others opinions and without ever contradicting them, question, without motive, their thoughts.  So if you took the time to read each of my words, please do so, I will gladly chat with you, thanks.",0,0,Humberto Cossio,WcIXCok9HPg,0.09431818181818184,2014-05-19 18:01:47,False,True

She said, 'My Lord, how shall I have a son, when no man has touched me? He said, 'Such is the way of ALLAH. HE creates what HE pleases. When HE decrees a thing HE says to it 'Be,' and it is;""—Qur'an, Surah 3:38-48  Muhammad also speaks of the resurrection of Jesus:  ""Thereupon she pointed to him. They said, 'How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?' Jesus said, 'I am a servant of ALLAH. HE has given me the Book, and has made me a Prophet; 'And HE has made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and has enjoined upon me Prayer and almsgiving so long as I live; 'And HE has made me dutiful towards my mother, and has not made me arrogant and graceless; 'And peace was on me the day I was born, and peace will be on me the day I shall die, and the day I shall be raised up to life again.' That was Jesus, son of Mary. This is a statement of the truth concerning which they entertain doubt.""—Qur'an, Surah 19:30-35  Oneness of God  (The Purity of Faith) Say: He is Allah, the One and Only. Allah, the Eternal, Absolute. He begets not, nor is He begotten. And there is none comparable unto Him.   It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, ""Be"", and it is. Verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord: therefore serve Him; this is the Straight Way. [The Holy Qur'an, Surah 19:35-36]  Allah says in verses 72 to 75 of Surah Al-Maeda (the 5th chapter of the Holy Qur'an): Certainly they do blaspheme who say: ""Allah is Christ the son of Mary."" But said Christ: ""O Children of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord."" Whoever joins other gods with Allah,- Allah will forbid him the paradise, and the Fire will be his abode. For evil-doers there will be no one to help. [The Holy Qur'an, Surah 5:72]   Certainly they do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of the three in a Trinity. There is no god except Allah alone. If they desist not from their word (of blasphemy), verily a grievous chastisement shall befall the blasphemers among them. [The Holy Qur'an, Surah 5:73] Also in the Gospel of Mark chapter 12 verses 28-29 it reads: One of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, he asked Jesus, 'Which commandment is the first of all?' Jesus answered, 'The first is, ""Hear, O Israel! the Lord our God, the Lord is One.""  Here Jesus was again refferring to what according to the present day Bible was written in the Old Testament in Deuteronomy chapter 6 verses 4 and 5: ""Hear, O Israel! the Lord our God, the Lord alone.

Jesus is a gentleman, he will not come into your hearts if you do not want him there, he will not force himself onto you. The reason to all of your pain and sorrow is because of satan. He is the father of all sins of all lies and every single downfall In your life.  For all of you who say that Jesus and God are two different people, just look at it in this perspective.  Time; you have the past, the present and the future.   The past is the past, but it still is classified as time.  Just like The father; the father is the father but still is classified as God.   The present is the present; yet it still is classified at time.   Just like The son. The son is the son but still is classified and God.   And finally The Future.

Some Christians try to force our religion on to people which only sends them the other way. In the end it comes down to what is between you and God. God gave us free will, a chance to make a choice from what we want to believe. A lot of people become lost or drift away from God which in todays society is not a hard thing to do. When lost it can be hard to find him and most just try to get help to get through a life crisis and leave it at that and when it doesn't work they give up and say he's not real like most atheist I'm sure, but if you try with all you power to be close to God then I promise you he wont leave you hangin.

Constantly u see a Prophecy and then latter see it come to fruition. There are over 300 prophecies to preceded Jesus. Jesus and His life fulfilling them all. Their are alot more concerning his return and we live in a period of time where he could return any minuet. He will also restore Israel in due course as the scripture is very clear about. The Bible/scripture also makes it clear that he was ""The Exact Representative or his Father"" and that he was the Son of God.  His core purpose was to be a sacrifice for the sins of every person who accepts Him as the one and only Savior and thru Faith in that and Faith alone we have eternal life . He did not come with a whole lot of sayings - rather he came to proclaim truth and be the perfect example.  LKayto be careful about your own attitude. Obviously you have never made a connection or understood who Jesus is. Because if you did and understood God's love seen in Christ, you would never make those comments. In fact without knowing him you can never come into the fullness of who you actual are.He has a purpose and a destiny for ALL that earnestly seek him. Obviously you don't need him, but Regardless whether you feel people are needy or have miserable lives, from where I stand, the picture of the world is not a pretty place. I see the world/people that have rejected Jesus and his message (divine truth) and i can't help think how empty most people lives are. We all need him - because eternity demands it and it is only through him that we gain the right to enter into his kingdom. At the point of death its too late and if you understood the alternative - Hell - its such a terrible place that you would not wish it on even your worst enemy - and its for eternity.

2014-05-31T02:04:36,"In The Holy Quran :  `Îsâ Ibn Maryam ( Arabic: عيسى, translit.: ʿĪsā ), known as Jesus in the New Testament, is considered to be a Messenger of God and al-Masih (the Messiah) in Islam :30 who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (banī isrā'īl) with a new scripture, al-Injīl (the Gospel). The belief that Jesus is a prophet is required in Islam, as it is for all prophets named in the Qur’an. This is reflected in the fact that he is clearly a significant figure in the Qur’an (appearing in 93 ayaat [or, verses]), though Noah, Adam and Moses appear with even greater frequency. It states that Jesus was born to Mary (Arabic: Maryam) as the result of virginal conception, a miraculous event which occurred by the decree of God (Arabic: Allah). To aid in his ministry to the Jewish people, Jesus was given the ability to perform miracles (such as healing the blind, bringing dead people back to life, etc.), all by the permission of God rather than of his own power. According to the Quran, Jesus, although appearing to have been crucified, was not killed by crucifixion or by any other means; instead, ""God raised him unto Himself"". Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim (i.e., one who submits to the will of God), as he preached that his followers should adopt the ""straight path"" as commanded by God. Islam rejects the Trinitarian Christian view that Jesus was God incarnate or the son of God, that he was ever crucified or resurrected, or that he ever atoned for the sins of mankind. The Quran says that Jesus himself never claimed any of these things, and it furthermore indicates that Jesus will deny having ever claimed divinity at the Last Judgment, and God will vindicate him. The Quran emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human being who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. Islamic texts forbid the association of partners with God (shirk), emphasizing a strict notion of monotheism (tawhīd). An alternative interpretation of this theology is held by Messianic Muslims.",0,0,Ayoub Id Abdellah,WcIXCok9HPg,0.06457219251336899,2014-05-31 02:04:36,False,False
2014-05-31T02:28:35,"I just watched this movie. It got alot of things wrong from the bible. Jesus wasnt some sniveling wuss that didn't know what was happening was happening. He knew he was there to fulfill the scriptures. I don't like how the actor rendered Christ.  A few key things the writers omitted or god wrong  Christ rebuked Peter for not wanting him executed. Mathew 16:21-23 From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. “Never, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to you!” Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan - You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.”  Jesus mentioning the temple falling for instance. He was not threatening to do it himself as this movie portrayed it. Jesus told many things that were going to happen and told us the reason that he told these things.  John 13:19, ""I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will know that I AM He.""  The temple fell 70 years after the crucifixion and was not mentioned in the bible, because it had not happened yet.  They also made the scribes and pharisees look as if they didnt know prophecy from their scriptures.

I did buy a seventy dollar Geneva, just today. Of course the english alphabet in 1560 hadn't fully developed into what it is today, but, this Geneva book has a lot of firsts/history to it. Once you get past the ""j"" is still an ""i"", the ""y"" isn't used at the end of words, the ""s"" looks like an ""f"" without the line across it, the ""v"" and ""u"" are used differently, the roman numerals are used for chapters and some words are spelled another way, you start to really enjoy a closer to ibree translation, you start to notice how this translation is really better than all these modern versions. I knew of this based on the Geneva from 1587 that's used in e-sword. The margin notes and commentary expound on what isn't picked up on by the reader. The apocrypha is included, the translations for these books, are also a major reason I decided to get this book. When you start reading the apocrypha books, you can start to realize that maybe these books were taken out.....to keep people ""in the dark"" about certain things. By the comments, and the amount, posted about this ""movie"", it's very easy to figure out, that people don't do enough research, and if they do read the ""old testament"" (it really is the tanakh, or rather the miqra in Ibree, this name is the true ibree name for it though), they haven't ""picked up"" on anything it says/relays.  Isa 57:5  Inflamed with idoles vnder euery greene tree?

Jackson:  Chapter III The Savior ""God"" Cults  Comparative hierologists (the comparative and historical study of religions) have discovered records of about thirty savior-""God"" religions.  These cults spread over all the world in very remote times, but they show evidence of a common origin.  The various savior-""Gods"" had the following similar traits:  1. They were born on or near Christ Mass/christmas. 2. Their mothers were virgins. 3. They were born in a cave or stable. 4. They worked for the salvation of humanity. 5. They were called saviors, mediators, healers, etc. 6. They were overcome by evil powers. 7. A descent into hell was made by them. 8. After being slain they arose from death and ascended to heaven at easter. 9. They founded religious institutions. 10. They were commemorated by eucharistic rites. 11. Many of these savior-""Gods"" were believed to make a second coming to the world.  Of the thirty or so discovered, here are some of the most notable ones:  1. bel of babylonia 2. osiris of egypt 3. prometheus of greece 4. mithra of persia 5. krishna of india  Chapter IV Bel: The Babylonian Christ  In the British Museum there is an ancient tablet from Babylon, dating back to about 2000 B.C.  This document is a description of a passion play relating to the god bel.  (The same divinity was called baal (basket-baal, base-baal, foot-baal.........something I've added) among the ancient Hebrews.)  This dramatic performance consisted of ten acts, or scenes.  My additions/comments: These acts or scenes, are about the exact traits listed above.

2014-09-17T16:09:13," Three parts of the bible muslims should read before they comment, because these days they seem to be all over the place making wild and mostly negative comments about other peoples religions without first examining the works and fruits of their own faith. ""The children of the bonds-woman shall always be against the children of the promise."" ""You will know them by their fruit."" ""If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life."" Last passage in the bible. Muslims seem to think they worship the same God. Jesus preached love and harmed no one. He killed no one and did not have an army, cut off peoples heads, have multiple wives, and tell men there were virgins waiting for them. He said salvation is a gift and that we enter heaven through faith, not works lest any man should boast. You people seem to be intent on sitting up on some imaginary moral high horse and telling everyone else they are going to hell whilst you are creating it here on earth. Pride is a terrible thing.

This very principle is said in Hinduism and all other religions either directly or indirectly :)  It is really sad that people interpret religion wrongly. I am a Hindu and this is what my religion says: ONE OF THE EASIEST WAY A SOUL CAN REACH GOD IS THROUGH ""LOVE"" . THERE ARE OTHER TOUGH  WAYS ALSO LIKE,            UNDERGOING THE LIFE BY SUFFERINGS BASED ON A SOUL'S KARMA, BUT THIS WAY IT WILL TAKE       UNIMAGINABLE AMOUNT OF TIME BECAUSE A SOUL ""CONTINUES"" TO DO GOOD AND BAD KARMA WHICH WILL ADD UPTO ITS ORIGINAL SIN.           DEVOTING ONESELF TOWARDS GOD AND PERFORMING VERY INTENSE PRACTICES TO REACH GOD WHICH IS CLOSER TO IMPOSSIBLE FOR NORMAL HUMANS.  WE HUMANS REALLY DOESN'T BELONG IN THIS WORLD(YES WE ARE SEPARATED FROM  HIGHER LEVEL OF ENTITIES DUE TO SOME SIN ).  EARTH IS JUST A PRISON AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PRISONS(PLANETS) WHERE MANY SOULS ARE TRAPPED  AS A PUNISHMENT SO THAT WE COME OUT OF IT AS A PURE ONE!!!  THERE IS NO DEATH FOR A SOUL, IT LEADS A LIFE ON EARTH ONLY BASED ON ITS KARMA(COMBINATION OF GOOD AND BAD)  SO WE HAVE TO FINISH OUR PERIOD AND REACH THE PLACE WHERE WE TRULY BELONG. EVERY RELIGION WAS ORIGINALLY FORMED TO GUIDE A PERSON TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PRISON(MAYA)  BUT EVIL INSIDE US TRIES SO HARD TO MAKE US MORE SINFUL AND RETAIN US HERE.  SINCE WE ARE SEPARATED FROM GOD (DUE TO OUR SINS), WE HAVE BOTH THE QUALITIES OF GOD(LOVE) AND EVIL INSIDE US. IF WE FOLLOW THE GODLY QUALITIES IN US (WHICH IS WHAT DECIDES THE KARMA) WE CAN SURELY GO BACK TO OUR TRUE HOME!!!  ATHEIST FRIENDS, JUST BECAUSE YOU GUYS DOESN'T BELIEVE IN A HIGHER ENTITY GOD, YOU WONT BE PUNISHED!!! BUT PLEASE BE KIND TO EVERY SINGLE LIVING BEINGS AROUND YOU,WHICH WILL SURELY HELP YOU GUYS TO GET TRUE HAPPINESS AND IF YOU FOLLOW THIS THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFETIME, YOU WILL SURELY REALIZE THAT THERE IS GOD INSIDE EVERYONE.  GOD DOESN'T WANT US TO BELIEVE IN HIM  BUT ONLY WANT US TO BE FREE FROM OUR KARMA THROUGH THE WAYS LIKE LEADING A LIFE FULL OF LOVING AND CARING TO EVERY OTHER ENTITIES AROUND US, BY NOT GIVING TROUBLE AND CAUSE PAIN PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY TO THEM, BY UNDERSTANDING FELLOW BEINGS PAIN AND DO OUR BEST TO HELP THEM OUT IF WE CAN :)",2,3,jen g,WcIXCok9HPg,0.12966819985569983,2014-12-24 15:35:06,False,False

Los ateos militantes critican las interacciones de la iglesia y los dogmas religiosos en la vida pública, pero ellos hacen una verdadera y constante labor de contra-evangelización en los medios, en la calle, en el arte. Incluso tienen tiempo de entrar aquí sólo para cuestionar la veracidad de la vida de Jesús y mofarse de los cristianos. Hablan de lo que no saben, pero eso lo hacemos todos. Lo triste y lo preocupante para el conjunto de la sociedad es preguntarse, en pleno siglo XXI, cuando realmente la iglesia ya ni pincha ni corta y los valores cristianos están denostados, ¿qué obtienen estos activistas pro-ateos? ¿Qué beneficio y regocijo interior encuentran al convencer a los que creen de que todo es mentira? ¿Qué satisfacción encuentran, en definitiva, en la decepción de los creyentes? Para mi la respuesta es muy sencilla: es como cuando en el colegio suspendías un examen, pero si todos los demás niños lo hacían, de alguna forma te sentías mejor. Ya no pueden decir que la iglesia influye, que prohíbe, que limita... ya no queda ni rastro de eso. Sólo un vacío del alma y una necesidad de sentirse acompañados en la nada existencial.

2015-02-01T13:00:24,"Day in and day out, nothing ever changes, unless you make the change, I sometimes think what it would be like to be someone like Bill Gates or any other Billionaire, but I think their lives are not a happy life, sometimes I think that they too, wish they could just fly away to somewhere where they could find peace within themselves, and peace all around them. So I guess life is all about finding your true self, and I found it, that's why I wrote the Source of Life, to help others find their true selves, their true Buddha nature........   When all of you, whoever you are, look yourself in the mirror, say to yourself ....... "" I am merely a representation of what you are willing to believe"" In this saying you will come to understand, that this is how the world see's others. But the truth is far more amazing indeed. Now ask yourself. ""Who is the chosen one?"" Answer......... YOU...... All of you, even the cat and dog, and all the other creatures that make up this Planet, and all the creatures throughout the Universe. We are all chosen by the source of life (God) we are all the Messiah, it's just the religious organisations will have you believe other wise, in order to stop you being free, for true freedom comes from the source of life (God) then through your heart and mind.   The human mind is of two parts, the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. The conscious mind lives in our brains, but our subconscious mind lives outside our body, in fact, the subconscious mind is our true self that is part of God. To know what perfection is, is impossible, but it's right in front of us the whole time, that being the subconscious mind, the source of life (God). We live in a world where our conscious mind is our main mind we use to think with, but our subconscious mind holds the secrets to our true selves that being part of the source of life (God).   When it is time for our body to die, our subconscious mind becomes the conscious mind and we become one with the source of life (God). It is interesting to note, that when people have a brain operation if they are conscious throughout the operation which in some cases they do an operation while the patient is still conscious, the surgeon will ask the patient to speak while the surgeon touches parts of the patients brain, the patient can not speak, but after the operation patients often say that they could think for themselves with no trouble at all while the operation was being carried out. So there is proof that the subconscious mind lives outside our bodies, but is connected to our conscious mind.   The subconscious mind is also connected to the highest dimension, the source of life (God) as well, but not our conscious mind. Our conscious mind live in this dimension which is filled with doubt and disbelief.Believe This.... Ultimately, when you view it from the highest dimension, there is no time and no space, there is no future and no past, it all is occurring in one fascinating moment of expression, but time is an illusion that has purpose.   To answer the question about animals having a subconscious mind that is connected to the source of life (God)? The answer to this is yes. Also Bugs, Fish and Birds all have a subconscious mind that is part of source (source of life God). And if you think that this planet is the only planet that has conscious minds that are connected to the subconscious mind that is the source of life (God), you got another thing coming, you can bet your bottom dollar that the universe is teeming with consciousness in the forms of whatever the subconscious mind source of life (God) made.   About wanting and getting things you like and want. Believe from your subconscious mind that you already have them, and it will happen.   The Conscious mind is a mind that is victimized by hate and suffering in order to get along, but remember, the religious organisations killed Jesus, who was a man that was one with the source of life (God) and even to this day, the religious organisations will kill whoever stops them from keeping this man made power. But the Subconscious Mind source of life (GOD) from time to time will down load wisdom on whom The Subconscious Mind chooses.... The source of life (God) is like the wind, you do not know when it will come, or for whom it will come, but when it comes to you, you will be filled with awe and greatness and Love. The conscious Mind can never know the Subconscious mind if the conscious Mind lives by the religious organisations belief systems, only when you free yourself from the religious organisations grip will you be one with the higher Subconscious Mind, the source of life, your true self, (God).",0,0,Samurai Jack,WcIXCok9HPg,0.10509982282134177,2015-02-01 13:00:24,False,False

But they replied: 'How can we speak with a baby in the cradle? ' [19.30] He (the baby) said: 'I am the worshiper of Allah. Allah has given me the Book and made me a Prophet. [19.31] He made me to be blessed wherever I am, and He has charged me with prayer and charity for as long as I shall live.

I know one thing for certain... no one on this thread is the Son of God, and thus does not speak for him.  The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector.  9 He then addressed this parable to those who were convinced of their own righteousness and despised everyone else.c 10 “Two people went up to the temple area to pray; one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee took up his position and spoke this prayer to himself, ‘O God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of humanity—greedy, dishonest, adulterous—or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week, and I pay tithes on my whole income.’d 13 But the tax collector stood off at a distance and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast and prayed, ‘O God, be merciful to me a sinner.’e 14 I tell you, the latter went home justified, not the former; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”f    As to my personal opinion:   Jesus IS THE FINAL COVENANT, who came not to cast down or replace the Law of Moses... but to succeed and perfect it. The two great commandments that contain the whole law of God are:  Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind, and with thy whole strength  Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.  The first three Commandments are summed up by the First Great Commandment Jesus gives, to love and honor God with all that we are.  The next Seven are summed up in the Second Great Commandment Jesus gave us, to love our neighbor as ourselves.  To do these two things is surely worth more than all the sacrifices and burnt offerings one could make. I pray that you live a life of true love of the glory of God, cherish each other, especially your enemies, for if we only loved those who love us... what reward is there in that?  Pray fore peace please... beware of the temptations this Lent, the same that the Devil used to tempt Jesus Pleasure, Fame and Power are temptations to us all that we must overcome to enter the Kingdom of God.   Peace be upon you all... Muslims (Sunni and Shia, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, non-believers, Christians and all the People of God, may he call us ALL home to love and serve His will. He will reign, and His lamb will rule.   But enough words: One of my favorite quotes that reflects how powerful Christ's perfect example of life is in changing the world through his loving EXAMPLE instead of force:  ""Preach the Gospel at all times and when necessary use words."" - St. Francis of Assisi ",0,0,Dan Bader,WcIXCok9HPg,0.25908354683864887,2015-03-05 01:31:03,False,False

That Jesus has got it in the back of his mind that this isn't something peculiar to himself. So when he says, ""I am the Way, no Man comes to the Father but by me.""

Now you're probably interested in what I have to say, so you can define me wrong, but this is not that kind of comment. And I actually do believe in a Bb theory, which is unbelievable but true. Tre truth is every one of us grouped as Christians sees God difrently. And don't be to stubborn about disproving God as your science ,as well as it tryes, it fails a lot of times. And I believe in it, eaven though I will probably newer see that earth is round, or I will newer see that explosion. I can only listen to what other people say most of the time. I trust to believe that most of it is true do to my rationality but again you will only see numbers or pixels on different machines showing you your proof. That of course is more pixels than prof for our God. But faith was always a wide spread thing. And it wasn't product of psycho people. It was a thing that was spouse to bring peace to mind and 'soul' not to offend you if you don't think you have one. Only ones that wanted money and power turned it into that. Do you think Christian wars were about God. Nah they were half rapers, half people from prisson that wanted to reduce their sentence by killing. Money.... Books of almost all religions were stating that killing is newer the answer and non of them supported it. There is our 10 rulles right? And no one that says that they are Christians don't follow our Bible to fullest. Don't lie?? It's impossible, try it. It's the people that ruiend it. That burned people because they were witches and homos, or more ridiculous reasons. That tortured them. And they still do today. Not because of God. They can't do it publicly anymore. Try holding a country secret and being caught by enemy. Se how good of a run you'll have. Half of Africa is starving and not just that many more. Not because of Christians, because majority of people are always and will always be like that. So no we can't prove God. We can have a reason to die. We can find hope in it in darkest times. And there are no atheists in the fox holes. Yea not everyone is having a great time and they need something to hold on (not me thankfully). So a one that spends it's life believing in 'imaginary' friend can still be friendly neighbour that dosent hate you if you're a Jew or a black guy dating a other black guy that works in abortion clinic. It's like feminism. Some take it really really wrong and call them self that. And the debate here was about proof pff. If God is not real the one who believes and dosent will die, as so will the entire universe once we run out of Dwarfs, and there will be no difference. And living your life is important to you but if you look objectively if it will end, and it will, one way or another unless you become a super PC, or find where string lead us if they do you will be gone and there will be no difference at all. Nothing matters because there is no future. And I can take a gun, hurt others and live like a king because why care about anything or anyone. I'm gona die so are they....

Another main character - Paul was there to appeal to Catholics. This movie was made even to appeal to ""New Age movement"" followers, because it distorts Jesus purpose TO SAVE SINNERS into ""Save the world"". There is a lot of New Age teachings and symbolism in this movie that has nothing to do with Bible, and despite it pretending to tell the story of Jesus, it seeds nothing but distorted lies with producers having ZERO respect to Word of God- The bible. Yes this movie might convert some into Christianity, but as a seed that grown in a bad soil (without proper foundation of true teaching of God) thous fast converts may easily get scorched and loose their faith pretty soon. What is the best way to destroy the seeds as to let them sprout and die? This is how Satan catches and destroys with souls with traps that show lie.

2019-05-10T14:07:11,"Hello my dear friends. Introduction to Islam (Submission to God) ""The only religion approved by God is Islam (Submission)"" 3:19 On first impression, many who read the above statement will immediately say: hold on, what about Judaism and Christianity? After all, these religions were also authorised by God!  However, if we discard all labels (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) and inspect the ideology of any of these divine revelations we would note the following relevant issues:  1- Contrary to what many believe, the word Islam is never used in the Quran as a title for the religion belonging only in the Quran nor a religion that is exclusive to the prophet Muhammad! The word Islam simply means Submission to God. It is necessary thus to stop thinking of Islam as the religion exclusive to the Quran, and in stead recognise Islam as a spiritual state of submitting to God alone.  2- All the prophets of God submitted to Almighty God and called their people to submit to the One and only God. The only true religion as far as God is concerned (after discarding the labels) is Submission to God (Islam).   3- It can also be said that all the labels we know today like Judaism and Christianity are man made. As an example, when Jesus Christ preached the love and submission to God, he never claimed that he is initiating a new religion which is called Christianity. In actual fact Jesus proclaimed that he has not come to change the law (of the Torah) but to confirm it (Mathew 5:17-18). The term 'Christianity', as a separate religion independent of Judaism, was not used except long after Jesus was dead.  In this light, Islam is not the religion of the Quran alone, nor is the religion brought by the prophet Muhammad. It is written in the Quran that Islam (Submission to God), is as old as Abraham (22:78), and that all the practises of Islam were first given to Abraham and his sons long before Muhammad was born.  ""He has legislated for you of the religion what He has instructed for Noah and what We inspired to you and what we instructed for Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: ""You shall establish the religion and be not divided therein."" 42:13    ""Abraham was neither a Jew, nor a Christian; but he was a monotheist submitter. He was not one of the Mushrikeen (those who set up partners with God)."" 3:67  ""The only religion approved by God is Islam (Submission)."" 3:19   The above Quranic verses confirm the truth that as far as God is concerned there has always been one religion. The one religion was decreed to Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad.  All the Scripture revealed to mankind from God advocate one and the same religion. Submission to God alone is also described as Monotheism (Hanifeyah), see 3:67, 6:79, 10:105, 98:5.   The principal command from God in all Scripture is to worship God alone devoting all the religion to Him and rejecting all other gods/idols:   Old Testament:  ""You shall have no other gods besides Me"" (Exodus 20:3)  New Testament:  ""You shall worship the Lord your God. and Him only you shall serve"" (Luke 4:8)    The Quran:  ""You shall know that: ""There is no other god beside God"" 47:19  Submission to God is the religion whereby we recognise God's absolute authority, and reach an unshakable conviction that God alone possesses all power; no other entity possesses any power that is independent of Him. The natural result of such a realisation is to devote our lives and our worship absolutely to God alone.   The above Quranic verse (42:13) confirms that the religion that was revealed to Muhammad in the Quran is not different from what was revealed to the previous prophets.  Within the religion of Islam God decreed specific rituals and practices designed to teach man to worship his Lord. These acts (Prayer, pilgrimage, etc.) were first taught to Abraham:  ""We made them (Abraham and his sons) leaders who guide by Our command and We inspired them to work good deeds, to observe the Salat and to give the Zakat."" 21:73   Millions of Muslims today believe that it was Muhammad who taught them how to pray and conduct their other rituals. This belief is erroneous since it violates the truth of the Quran. In the Quran we read:  1- The practises of Islam were first given to Abraham and his sons (Prayer, pilgrimage, Zakat ... etc see 21:73, 22:26-29). This took place long before the time of Muhammad.  2- Across the ages, as normally happens, many of these rituals were corrupted and the element of idolising human messengers and saints crept in. All the practises were thus restored to their pristine purity in the Quran. God also promised that the Quran will never be corrupted (15:9), thus all believers will always have access to the pure way of worshipping God.  3- Muhammad and all believers were commanded to follow the creed of Abraham, which is defined in all verses which have the words ""Millat Ibrahim"" (creed of Abraham), as Monotheism and the refrain from associating partners with God (16:123). See Millat Ibrahim.   4- God also tells Muhammad (and all believers) in verse 5:48 that within each revelation there are specific laws and rites that are specific to the receivers of this particular revelation. Hence the command is issued in 5:48 that Muhammad should follow the rites given to him in the Quran and not the rites of previous people.  ----------------------------------  Essentially, if there is only one religion decreed by God there must be One 'truth'. Do we conclude that there should be one revelation? The answer to this question is that 'truth' and 'revelation' are not absolutely equivalent terms. Because 'truth' is an absolute term it is situated independent of form, whereas revelations are relative to time, people and place, and thus require a form. But to speak of form is to speak of diversity and thus plurality.  The need for different revelations at different times and for different people is justified by means of the following:  1- Mankind has gone through enormous development through the ages physically, mentally and spiritually, that there was always the need for various revelations at different times and for different peoples. Although the various revelations are united in message and truth, yet we find that God never addresses identical revelations to two different people. This being so, it can be said that the diverse revelation do not, and should not contradict one another, for although they differ in form, the religion decreed in all of them (Monotheism) is one.  2- If there appears any apparent contradictions between different revelations, they are in human receptacles and not in the divine message. This is a result of human inability to interpret such revelations and more importantly the failure to preserve the 'truth' contained in the revelation, which always tends to be impaired and altered with the passing of time.  Ultimately, the apparent contradiction is no more than one between corrupt scripts and interpretations of the original revelations, and not between the revelations themselves. Inevitably, and through corruption in the transfer and application of a Scripture, together with the social and cultural factors that always widen the gap between the factions, we are left with a multitude of corrupt religions. These sub-religions in many ways hardly bare any resemblance to one another, or to the original religion decreed by God.  For that, there becomes a necessity for mankind to receive another revelation that puts them back on track with God's law that has been badly corrupted.  3- We find that up until the advent of the industrial revolution and the fast travel era, the world was still a wide expanse of disjointed lands and peoples. Many people would have not even heard of those Scripture that have already been revealed in various other parts of the world. This is why a new scripture would be revealed to new communities who have not received the Scripture.  However, after the revelation of the Quran, there became no need for any further revelations. Not because the message of the Quran is much different from the message of the Torah or the Gospel, but because of the following reasons:  a- A divine promise has been endorsed in the Quran that it will not be corrupted like previous Scripture. As a result, and if the message would remain intact in one Scripture, there becomes no need to reveal further Scripture.  b- With the advent of the modern fast travel means of today, the whole world became a closer knit unit. People do not have to travel to hear or receive information, it is brought right up to them through the various media channels that were not available a few centuries ago.

2020-02-10T18:48:57,"The Free Gift of Eternal Life  I hope the message of salvation helps you. God bless. Don’t take any of my word for it.  How to receive eternal life right now for free and be absolutely 100% sure that you will go to Heaven someday! All scripture is from KJV (King James Version)  Let’s get started; God’s simple, Biblical plan of salvation is NOT from any religion whatsover. It’s NOT from Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Jehovah’s Witness’s, Mormons, Seventh Day Adventists, Buddhism, etc.   It’s simple and free to receive eternal life according to the Bible. You’re saved by believing the Gospel. What exactly is the Gospel? The word Gospel means “Good News”   There’s some BAD NEWS that you must know before you believe the Gospel.  1. You must realize that you’re a sinner in need of a Savior.   The Bible says everyone is a sinner including you and I. We cannot save ourselves because we are sinners and we cannot get into Heaven by works. Being a good person or living a Christian lifestyle does NOT get you into Heaven either.   As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: -Romans 3:10  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; -Romans 3:23  The payment for our sins is death, eternal separation from God. Sin is NOT paid for by doing good works, turning from sin, going to church, water baptism, living a Christian lifestyle, etc. It’s nothing but the blood of Jesus.   For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. -Romans 6:23  He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. -John 3:36  More scripture: John 3:18, 2nd Thessalonians 1:8-9  Do NOT trust in yourself or good works because God’s standard for us to go to Heaven is 100% sinless perfection. No sin, not even a lie can enter Heaven (Revelation 21:27) The problem is, none of us are perfect, None of us are good enough to go to Heaven because we all have missed the mark of sinless perfection. That’s why it’s completely impossible to save ourselves.   You MUST be born again in order for you to go to Heaven.  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. -John 3:3  What does it mean to be born again? It’s to be born of God’s spirit. You get born again by believing the Gospel.   The purpose of God’s Law is to show us we are guilty sinners in God’s sight and we need a Savior which is Jesus Christ (Romans 3:19-25, Galatians 3:24-26) That was the bad news. Now for the Good News.  2. The Gospel aka The Good News is that Jesus Christ (who is God in the flesh) died on the cross for our sins at Calvary, shedding His blood; Christ was buried,and was resurrected on the third day.   The Bible tells where the Gospel is. It is in 1st Corinthians was 15:1-4. The Gospel is about the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is the only true Gospel you believe and trust 100% This is the Gospel that saves you. This is our assurance for salvation.   1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;   4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  -1st Corinthians 15:1-4  But God commandeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. -Romans 5:8  For he (God) hath made him (Jesus) to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. -2nd Corinthians 5:21  This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. -1st Timothy 1:15  But this man (Jesus), after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; -Hebrews 10:12  More scriptures: John 1:29, Romans 5:6, 1st Peter 2:24, 1st Peter 3:18, Hebrews 10:10, 1st John 2:2  3. By faith in Jesus Christ ALONE for salvation, you are immediately saved.  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. -John 3:16  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hearth  my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. -John 5:24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. -John 6:47  And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. -Acts 16:30-31  More scriptures: John 1:12, John 6:28-29, John 6:40, Romans 10:9-10, Romans 10:13  You’re NOT saved by good works/good deeds, water baptism, praying a prayer, turning from sin, going to church, fully surrendering your life to Christ, asking Jesus into your heart, confessing your sins to a priest, living a Christian lifestyle, etc. None of those things will save you.  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  Not by works, lest any man should boast. -Ephesians 2:8-9  And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. -Romans 11:6  But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Romans 4:5  Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost. -Titus 3:5  (More scriptures: Isaiah 64:6, Acts 13:39, Romans 3:20, Romans 3:26-28, Romans 10:4, Galatians 2:16, Galatians 2:21, Galatians Chapter 3,  Galatians 5:4, Philippians 3:9)   You’re NOT saved by works because eternal life is a FREE GIFT from God (Romans 5:15-19, Romans 6:23, Ephesians 2:8-9) Because eternal life is a free gift, you CANNOT earn it by works or by living a Christian lifestyle. The free gift was paid for in full by the shed blood of Christ. The forgiveness of sins (past, present, future) is through the blood of Jesus Christ.   Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. -Romans 5:9  In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; -Ephesians 1:7  Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. -Hebrews 9:12  More scriptures: (Romans 3:25, Ephesians 2:13, Colossians 1:14, 1st Peter 1:18-19, Hebrews 9:22, Revelation 1:5)  Salvation is NOT found in good works or a religion; but in a person Jesus Christ. Jesus is the ONLY way to Heaven. No religion can save you.  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -John 14:6  More scriptures: Acts 4:12, 1st Corinthians 8:6, 1st Timothy 2:5  Salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Jesus Christ alone. No religious works or efforts involved! Simply believe the Gospel (1st Corinthians 15:1-4)    Jesus paid it all, we paid 0. Salvation is dependent on Jesus’s death, burial, and resurrection in your place, and NOT on anything you could do because we can’t earn it. Simply receive the free gift of eternal life by faith. Eternal life is a guaranteed promise from God and it cannot be taken away.   In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; -Titus 1:2  How to get saved: (THIS IS NOT A PRAYER YOU PRAY, the sinners prayer DOES NOT save you. Just simply believe.)   Simply admit that you’re a sinner. Believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, He was buried, and was resurrected on the third day.   Trust Jesus Christ as your Savior today!   The nanosecond you trust Jesus’s death, burial, and resurrection, you are saved and sealed forever (Ephesians 1:13-14, Ephesians 4:30)   Salvation CANNOT be lost! Remember to read your Bible (King James Version, KJV) Don’t put your trust in man, put your trust in the Bible.  All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. -John 6:37  And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. -John 6:39  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. -John 19:30  These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. -1st John 5:13  More scriptures: John 10:28-29, Romans 8:38-39, Hebrews 13:5  http://www.jesusisprecious.org/fundamentals/gospel.htm  http://www.jesusisprecious.org/fundamentals/imputed_righteousness.htm  https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g  https://youtu.be/fL87OKrch6k  https://youtu.be/9b8JlDqURk4  https://youtu.be/35IkHeJ9U7w  https://youtu.be/p9rm9m_NSG4  https://youtu.be/wCR9CjoJVsU  https://youtu.be/DUliTy79-ac  https://youtu.be/ah9I17Z1CWE  Understanding Repentance by Thomas Cucuzza Part 1:  https://youtu.be/TV6FaRd4Hj8  Understanding Repentance by Thomas Cucuzza Part 2:  https://youtu.be/g9OgHf2d-zw",0,0,Hunter F,WcIXCok9HPg,0.171187996031746,2020-02-10 18:48:57,False,False

(Amen please answer) صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ المَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّالِّينَ 7  3. The Magnificent Seat Verse; Ayat al-Kursi:  2:255 Allah, there is no god except He, the Living, the Everlasting. Neither dozing, nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Who is he that shall intercede with Him except by His permission! He knows what will be before their hands and what was behind them, and they do not comprehend anything of His Knowledge except what He willed. His Seat embraces the heavens and the earth, and the preserving of them does not weary Him. He is the High, the Great.  اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الحَيُّ القَيُّومُ لاَ تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلاَ نَوْمٌ لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الأَرْضِ مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَاءَ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ وَلاَ يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا وَهُوَ العَلِيُّ العَظِيمُ   4. Unique Oneness - Al-'Ikhlas سورة الإِخلاص In the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Most Merciful بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ Sub.: Allah is One, there is none equal to Him 112:1-4 112:1 Say, 'He is Allah, the One, قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ 1 112:2 the called upon. اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ 2 112:3 Who has not given birth, and has not been born, لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ 3 112:4 and there is none equal to Him.' وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُواً أَحَدٌ 4 Say: He is one of God (1) God, the Exalted (2) did not give birth nor was He born (3), and He was not sufficient for one (4)  Note: It is falsely misleading for Christian to say that Jesus is the son of Allah - as fact not as metaphorically – firstly Christians having no evidence from the lost book of Isa (Jesus), not even with their current 4 bibles in their hands and the meaning of their slander is that (the Creator has a male organ that intercoursed in sex with Mary, and she bore Isa -Jesus-) !!!! Glory be to Allah, the Great, for He is in the same status as He was before he created the universe and humans  Secondly: The noble Prophetic sayings, which is the explanation of the previous Qur’anic verses and others verses by Muhammad the Messenger of Allah, may Allah grant him peace, before the Angel Gabriel and whoever attended from his Companions. This includes 12 pillars of face  1. Islam is to testify that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (as Abraham, Moses and Isa Jesus etc) 2. The prayer is evaluated. 3. Zakat is paid 4. And fasting Ramadan, 5. The house made a pilgrimage if you could. 6. Faith is to believe in God 7. And his angels 8. His books 9. And its messengers 10. And on the last day, 11. You believe in goodness and badness 12. Spiritual Perfection (Ihsan) is to worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, and if you do not see Him, He is seeing you.  Third: This above Prophetic saying was explained by scholars such as Abu Hanifa (80), Malik (179h – 795ce), Al-Shafi’i (204) and Ahmed bin Hanbal (241), and narrated by Al-Hafiz Al-Tahawi (b.229 d.321) on their behalf and via hundreds of scholars who say In about 344 paragraphs as follows:  In the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Most Merciful,  We say in witnessing to the Oneness of Allah - believing in the support of Allah, the High, – that indeed:   1. Allah, the High, is One 2. Allah has no equal. 3. There is nothing like Him. 4. Nothing frustrates Him. 5. There is no god except Allah. 6. Allah is Ancient without a beginning. 7. Allah is Eternal without an end.",0,0,Ahm Kml,WcIXCok9HPg,0.20379844961240307,2020-04-12 09:37:27,False,False
