I know 20th Century Fox wants to revive a well known novel into this current generation's movie, but there are times that I fear that some of the characteristics of Poirot, the plot, etc might get chopped and mixed into something that isn't going to stick 100% of the original. Yes, the TV series has also the same potholes in that situation.

This is the Queen of Crime - one of her gems: Poirot is one of the most complex, fascinating detectives ever written. Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov, and now Branagh have taken a crack at Poirot. But David Suchet is Hercule Poirot, hands down. Unfortunately, I automatically think Branagh pales in comparison, to Christie's Poirot, but that's just me. This looks too modern/2017-ish. The ambiance isn't here. Even if the plot sticks to the book perfectly, I don't sense Christie here, unlike the adaptations with Ustinov and Suchet, if that makes sense - not trying to insult Branagh/cast/writers etc. Though I do hope people viewers who watch this get excited, read her books, and watch Agatha Christie's Marple (Rutherford, Hickson, Lansbury, McEwan, and McKenzie , to decide which actress u like enjoy the most) and Poirot.

Agatha Christie wrote this book to show the humane side of Poirot highlighting a major conflict of belief. And Suchet did it justice, by the end of the episode I was bawling and applauding because very few actors have left me in awe of their performance. Suchet is Poirot. There will never be another. Saying that, I won't dismiss this movie before watching it. A lot of effort goes into movie making. To discredit it after watching a trailer seems to be rather unfair. My first book was Agatha's and my childhood was filled with a lot of Poirot watching. Now, I'm not a fan of many people in the world. But I AM a fan of Mr. David Suchet!! Good luck to this movie.

His Hercule Poirot is very groomed in his waxed moustache, managed hair, and clothing. Not to mention his very thick accent, showing that French is his first, and more preferred, language. Now what do I see with this Hercule Poirot? Messy hair, bushy unkempt moustache, crooked tie, and an accent that is very 'light'. He looks like he's going to rob the train, not solve a murder. Also the line ""I am probably the greatest detective in the world."" that is quite unlike Poirot's character. If anything he says ""I AM the greatest detective in the world!"" as he is proud of his intellect and has the accolades to attribute to it.

I absolutely adore the larger than life take that they're doing with this. I feel like most movies and adaptations these days have to be all dark and gritty, and though a lot of Madame's works are fairly dark, there's always a sorta lightness/colorfulness that I associate with them. I can tell this movie is definitely gonna play up the classic, idk how to word it, not ""goofiness"", and not even ""lightheartedness"" but...just take a look at the website for the movie, and you'll see what I mean by how it feels like they're portraying it as if it were a game. And thats a good thing! I love it and I can't wait for this to come out! Also, yeah, I'm not the BIGGEST fan of Branagh's Poirot, but we still have to see how he does.

But the general was a suspect while the doctor helped Poirot investigate (well yeah he was technically a suspect too but u kno what I mean). Would Poirot let the guy he suspected from the beginning (along with Mary Debenham) investigate with him and hear all of his suspicions? Would he trust a fellow suspect to examine the body?

It doesn't let anyone absorb inside the movie from Poirot's view. And he was also...not the Poirot type we Poirot fans know. Secondly, the actor for Macqueen is really most terrible at acting out his character--Josh Gad! Sure he's very good at Jolly characters, but not a rather serious character like Hector Macqueen. It's very different from the Macqueen I imagine. Thirdly, they changed too much from the book. I think they rather hurried through the part about interrogating the passengers, (which is actually the part for you to think)and they changed Monsieur Bouke too. I think a good suspense is to change when you must, but the key parts mustn't change.

Yes, it is reasonably similar to every single other adaptation and it may distracting having so many big names in the film. But I can see why Mr Branagh made this film. Christie become a niche forgotten figure in the 2010s and even though I wouldn't recommended her writing to very small children, I think that 13-14 year should read Murder on the Orient Express. It's a lesson in creativity, suspence, style and descriptive writing.

There were few  unnecessary scenes that weren't in the book (which is not a bad thing it just shows director's creativity and all). The dialouges were somehow   awkward but maybe it's just me who feels that way. What made the film bad for me could be that in the book we have a lot more about interviews with the passengers and whole story was more humoristic when film is more concentrated around Daisy and Armstrong's tragedy.  Well it's just mine opinion. Everyone who's going to see the film should judge by their own. The whole realization was fantastic though.

Anyway every actor is terrific, but the real hero is the story. The climax is really ""unthinkable"". Agatha Christie is really a mastermind. As for Hercule Poitor, he is a real competitor to Sherlock Holmes. And I am sure in future he will also return like SH. Overall I enjoy the movie. One last thing. The love, pain and agony of losing a loved one or see suffering of a loved one is very strong emotion. It can only a feel by a person who has gone through the experience in his\her real life.

In the 1974 version, Poirot figured out who the murderers are without any confession from the passengers. There were also more reasons as to why some things were said (the grease on Helena's passport, Why Mrs Hubbard kept saying 2nd Husband, ""Grunwald""), the face to face with Princess Dragomiroff was also incomplete and lacking information (the old version led Poirot into figuring out who Elena and Debenham were).

When Branagh says: ""I'm Hercule Poirot, probably the most famous detective in the world"", I had enough. I was sitting and waiting for the movie to end. I don't recommend at all. The only scenes I liked was when the train was leaving Istanbul, we could see some great takes of the evening city and also at the end when the train was approaching Brod, we  could see some nice takes of the mountains covered in snow.

2018-01-27T22:52:39,"The movie ""Orient Express"" (all versions) was inspired by a real person, called Eugen Alimanescu, a romanian police commissioner. At the time it was called ""Justice"", ""The invincible"" or ""The Iron Commissioner"". In 1946, several crimes took place in the selection of the ""Orient Express"" train that traveled on the Paris - Bucharest - Istmabul route. These took place in the Romanian train sector, and the victims were, in turn, a Swiss diplomat and a Soviet diplomat. As cases risked taking other interpretations given the quality of the assassins, a quick resolution was required. Eugen AlimƒÉnescu, a romanian police commissar,  was responsible for solving it. He succeeded in detecting a few elements common to the two crimes, so he deduced that they were committed by the same murderer, perhaps a very stylish one considering the place where they were. Disguised as a businessman, Alimanescu managed to identify the killer and dragged him into a race. Without anything, the murderer tried to rob the ""businessman"" Alimanescu and at the same time to kill him. He was shot (injured), and at the hospital in Arad where he was taken to get his first aid, he died. Not before confessing the two crimes committed on the train.",0,0,viralshield,Mq4m3yAoW8E,0.09166666666666666,2018-01-27 22:52:39,False,True
2018-01-27T23:39:12,For those of you who don‚Äôt feel like seeing it the plot is under read more       So basically the passenger that died killed the daughter of mr. and mrs. Armstrong which caused mrs. Armstrong to go into shock which also caused her to go into labor and she died along with her baby. Mr Armstrong sent a letter to the detective but committed suicide before the detective received it. Everyone on the train had a connection to either the Armstrong family or the victim himself. Everyone had something against the victim. Basically every passenger killed him. Hence the 12 stabs he had.  The detective didn‚Äôt report them to the authorities though because he believes justice was served here.

I often said to myself that I will stop looking for rating that film critics gave to particular movie. This film is breaking point, I shall no more check ratings of the movie cause I finally understand what they are. A lie. Their whole perception is distorted. For example this is perfect film. Yes Godfather is also and that is clear, so why it is not clear to them about this film is strange indeed. For example we have two man. First one eats the apple so he know what is apple. The second one is trying to describe apple but they never eat it. First person who is healthy in mind eats apple. The other who try his best to perfectly describe it but never eats is not healthy in mind and is like movie critics. At least most of them. So from now I will 100% ignore their opinion, its like concept about something you never have experience of. They watch movie, but their perception is distorted. Its quite good to ignore them.
