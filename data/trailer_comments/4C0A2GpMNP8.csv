Yes it's a continuation of them - in a sense - and not a re-telling of the originals but I worry it lacks the substance of what was so exciting about the books (the magic, mysticism, history and just general depth). Ok fine, they have to adapt it to suit general audiences but 1 of 2 things concern me; 1) they haven't put enough substance in the film to set it aside from other mainstream action-adventure films (and makes it a bit bland) or 2) they try and cram way too much into the film and confuse the audience (ones who haven't read the books and can't follow the story), of which options I can't say which I'm mostly worried about. If they plan to do a number of sequels to expand on it all, then great. With all that being said, I'll reserve judgement until I see the film; Idris and Matthew are both fantastic actors and I am genuinely curious about the whole continuation and imagining of Roland's journey; hopefully it won't disappoint.",0,0,Stephen Vickerman,4C0A2GpMNP8,0.2140625,2017-05-03 16:10:57,True,True

2017-05-03T19:56:02,"I just came to read all the racist comments from angry white people as usual. ""Wahhhh hollywood hates white people"". Meanwhile practically every single character in the movie is white except 1 guy. As usual white folks aren't happy unless 100% of every movie is 100% white characters.   I already figured it out too, the problem is white people cannot empathize with non white characters, period. Diversity in movies and TV is still relatively new to them, sure you have your low budget black movies and black shows for a while now. But non white characters popping up in big budget movies that are usually whites only is still unusual to them, and they can't accept the change. See us non white folk have long ago  learned to adapt and empathize with white characters, cause for ages that's all there ever was. I.E. blacks and browns love movies like the LOTR trilogy even though their isn't a non white face in all of middle earth. Why? because we don't need non white characters to be able to enjoy the movie or find some empathy with the characters. Now finally we are starting to get more diverse characters in movies, very few mind you, and very slowly,  and yet still white people cannot handle it because they have not learned to embrace change or empathize with people who don't look like them, and they never needed to before so this is not something they can learn to do overnight, i understand that.  But this is the very crux of the situation, empathy, plain and simple, whites who are the majority of Americans, simply do not have it for non white people, be it movies or otherwise.",0,0,blacc beard,4C0A2GpMNP8,0.027793238507524222,2017-05-03 19:56:02,True,True

Elba's performance just makes him look brooding. The Man in Black should be terrifying, menacing, and mysterious. Here he just isn't. Jake should be entirely different. Even modern NYC clashes with the feel of NYC in the books. The Tower looks like something out of the Hobbit--with its beams looking like CG blobs.  The worst part is the Matrix-esque choreography or the fight sequence (which ultimately NEVER happens in the books). In the books the gunslinging was gritty and dirty and grounded in some sort of reality. Here he's literally THROWING BULLETS and CATCHING THEM WITH HIS GUN. WHAT?  The first book in the series depicts the world as a wasteland. Here it looks lush and overgrown. Yes, later in the series you see forest, but the world is an irradiated dump with terrifying mechanical bears w/ satellite dishes on their heads. I see nothing that resembles the setting of the books here.

Fuck that, Roland would walk right over jake's corpse to get to his goddamn tower and it wouldn't matter if Jake's world was long dead or brimming with life. He was an addict. A knight with a quest for the holy grail who forgot the reason the grail was supposed to be important in the first place and then, along the way remembered it piece by piece. It was an evolution of watching an animal who was once a man become human once more and that's what I loved.

I'd rather see Roland stagger messily through the incident at Tull, bloody, stabbed in several places, forced to murder an entire town, than see him drop-load his six shooters, kill a baddie, then say a one-liner... Maybe I'm just being a bumhug. Hopefully one day some brave group of souls will get the chance to tackle this appropriately, perhaps as a series, each season representing one of the books. It's a shame really, Matthew McConaughey would have made a fantastic Man in Black in a proper version of the tale.

2017-05-04T13:31:56,"For those of you who have not read ""The Dark Tower"" series, Roland of Gilead (the gunslinger) is like a Jedi knight in the old west, who uses pistols instead of light sabers. He is absolutely one badass mammy-jammy, period. Some of the things he does in the novel-series are mind boggling awesome.  I've read 95% of all Stephen King novels. ""The Dark Tower"" series is, by far, his very best work. At least six of those seven series novels I literally couldn't put down, and I read them within a few days. ""The Dark Tower"" overlaps into A LOT of his other works, mainly The Stand (""the walking dude"" is¬†a bad guy in The Dark Tower also), Salem's Lot, and many, many others. SK did a superb job in The Dark Tower of mixing all these other books into TDT, in a way that makes sense.  Having said that, it's difficult to watch this trailer without a critical eye. What I mean is, there are significant differences in TDT novels, and several things I've seen in this trailer. Still, it looks like it will be a good movie (definitely), but as an avid admirer of TDT novels, and as always happens when I read a novel first, and then watch the Hollywood adapted movie afterward, I know I'll¬†be disappointed in the end and as always happens, I'll wonder why in the hell Hollywood didn't just simply follow the novel's structure and be done with it??  Bottom line, I'll definitely go see it. One tiny detail is (for example), it looks like the movie is going to bypass the numerous, single doors standing up on a beach...each one opening into a different world and on the beach are these freaked out shellfish called ""lobstrosities"" (just one example).

When I went back for seconds I asked the staff for extra sesame seeds because my last order had none.  They told me they don't put sesame seeds in because some people might be allergic.  I then asked, ""But you put sesame oil in, don't you?""  They answered, ""No."" for the same reason.  Again, it was a good dish.  But for God's sake,  ""HOW CAN YOU CALL IT SESAME CHICKEN WHEN THERE IS NO SESAME???""  Idris Elba? Great actor.  Phenomenal actor.  The Dark Tower? An AMAZING EPIC STORY!!!  When The Shawshank Redemption made the screen, the character portrayed by Morgan Freeman in the book was a white guy.  An Irish guy, actually.  That is why his nickname was Red.  The race change had no effect on the story or the context.  However, in The Dark Tower, it is EXTREMELY relevant.

Back when this movie was all speculation and rumors back in the day I heard they were going to cast Havier Bardem which while he doesn't have the pull that Idris does today it was pretty close to the image I had of Roland in my head ).  When I heard Mccaunaghey was in it I thought he was going to play Eddie (Although he may be getting on in years for that role, he might suit Randall Flag better.). Dunno about the boy, but I'm sure any child actor can play Jake. What really miffed me about the advert is it seems like not only is it going to be a bit of a departure from the opening act of the dark tower series, but the editing the action sequences and the music just makes it seem like it's going to be another brainless action flick that'll be on par with the cringy likes of this years King Arthur.

2017-05-23T13:16:25,"A couple of issues. First, Idris Elba is way too buff to be the Gunslinger. Idris looks like a marine and he is good looking. In the books, Roland was often referred to as ""long, tall and ugly"". I always pictured Clint Eastwood...lanky, but not overly intimidating looking. Skilled, not physically imposing. Casting Matthew McConaughey as the man in black is another curious choice. He's too cool...he's like George Clooney.  I would have gone with Javier Bardem for Roland...have him drop 20 lbs for the role. Bardem looks like an addict and that's what Roland truly is. Brad Dourif would have been my choice for the man in black...he played Grima Worm Tongue in the Lord of the Rings. The Man in Black is a liar and a scoundrel...a super natural weasel. Brad Dourif could be that guy. In the end, Hollywood is twisting the story into a perceived market. It's what they usually do. Money over art.

My concern here is, was Idris Alba the right PERSON to play Roland. He is a fine UK actor and was outstanding in Luthor, loved his performance. But is Roland¬†black here for the sake of it? With¬†the ""PC"" thing of making a character ""non white"" or ""no longer white"", we have¬†had rumours of Mr Elba set to play James Bond and Dr Who. Making the character black for the sake of it. Why not make him Chinese, Indian, or an Eskimo? Is Roland white in the books? The gunslingers in those towns, in the World Moved On, based on Wild West towns would have all been white Americans. Susannah/Detta/Odetta was black, and is stated as so. ¬†¬†Roland, Eddie and Jake are white. Mr Elba as Roland in this post apocalyptic world has a big dose of Denzel Washington as Eli about him. There are many actors who could have portrayed this role more like the book. Not quite a Clint Eastwood way, but closer to that kind of world. In a way this ""let's make the character black"", ""let's have a¬† white character played by a black actor"" is¬†the most offensive things of all. Offensive to blacks and white. Offensive to Chinese and Indians. And probably offensive to the¬†Eskimos¬†as well.

Hollywood made a movie out of each of the Lord of the rings books, the took the Hobbit, which is HALF the length of the other books and made three movies out of it. This is Stephen King's opus, and they want to make ONE 1:35 movie out of it?  As the director and producer I would be ashamed.  They have probably never even read the books. To be done right, a movie from the first two books, then a movie from the next three, then a final movie from the last two. This would be the minimum number, simply out of respect for the series.  So many of Stephan King' books tie into this series: Hearts of Atlantis, Salem's Lot just to name a couple. So Hollywood Producers, directors and writers, read the books FIRST, then make the movie.  I am SO tired of the ""Poetic licence"" taken by Hollywood now-a-days. Either make the movies true to the books, or don't make them at all. If I have offended Hollywood, then good, I do not apologize for it.  You have been making sequels for so long that a great original comes along and you have no idea how to treat it.
