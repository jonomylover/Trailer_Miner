2014-11-27T16:58:11,This looks like a fun movie. I may see it! Also... wow... I've read a few old comments and there seems to be people online who think movies like The Hangover is original. I grew up in the 1980s and as far as The Hangover goes... it's a bit similar (not* saying they are exactly the same but a bit alike) to Bachelor Party with Tom Hanks. Also* not* saying Bachelor Party was an original concept either. I haven't done a ton of research on films like those... but just saying The Hangover films are not a new idea.
