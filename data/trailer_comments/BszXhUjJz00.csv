(Sorry if none of that makes sense, going by the danish edition). The plot doesn't look like it will have anything to do with the story it's named for (sensible, since Star Wars stole half of that story decades ago), but at least the movie is adapting some great moments from all over the series instead. However, I'm pretty disappointed in the overall production design - how does the actual Valerian movie end up looking less like Valerian than the Fifth Element did? With the same director?  My biggest worry is Laureline's actress, though - she seems to be playing a COMPLETELY different character, which is a crying shame. (Also way too young for the role, imo.) The classic dynamic of warm, open-minded and clever Laureline lovingly mopping the floor with uptight dork Valerian would have been AMAZING and fresh in a movie - instead it looks like we're getting a standard-issue tough girl don't need no man (until they inevitably fall in love).

2016-11-11T06:30:56,"Damn that sea monster scene was the best. I don't understand why she had  to beat him though. Probably she's the type who like to leech off her  males like a jobless person who leeches off their parents and also throw  his boyfriend away once he has no more money. Also suddenly she points  at back and there are monsters running. And why the hell are they on a  space ship like bed in the middle of the beach ? It's like total  randomness everywhere.    Can we ever get a movie where a guy punches a girl and it's like ""hahaha  she totally deserved it"" for once, instead of getting OMG it's a rapist male sexual harrasment violence barbaric thing  ? She could've just stabbed him and went I still love you. because  feminist trash girls and feminist worship corrupted white knights. Must  be like population humans are 100/ woman are 50 and they all want to  take advantage of men , among 50 men at least 25 are female worship  white knights. so 75 approves feminist.  only 25 are not blind. That's why we can't get rid of feminist. Obviously everybody wants to cover the female raping males news.  Female - ""Please cover up that I raped you and also stole all your money  then I'll let you fuck me because money turns me on but I will not like  it if you treat me like a prostitute because I'm women and women never  reasons out logically. I need to be seen as a pretty innocent cute girl but I do love to sell  my body by wearing sluttiest clothes to tempt all old grandpas with money then throw them after leeching because I'm a jobless  trash.  You do know that I wear these slutty clothes to tempt males to touch my butt and then make them seen as sexual predators right ? Also did I mention women are innocent because unlike males who only look  girls as sexual material but do fall in love, we women don't like male body or want to make love but want to leech off  males. It's just funny that these men still aren't gay and too scared to be called gay if they don't love me.  Like I asked this rich guy to date me but he said no so I asked him are you a pussy or just a fag. and he immediately started  crying and gave me money."" Brainless white knight male - ""Ok. That actually turns me on. I'm gonna  act manly by actually becoming a slave to a female and get all my life force leeched out and die."" People who are smart males - ""These people are dumber than any dumb and  dumber movies and fucked in the head harder than 1 cup 2 girls.""",0,1,78l we4,BszXhUjJz00,0.15555555555555559,2016-11-11 06:30:56,True,True

2016-11-13T15:55:04,"On one hand, I really liked Fifth Element, as well as Leon the Professional. On the other hand, I'm really not feeling the young leads - without any context given in the trailer, it feels more like those crappy wish fulfillment YA flicks (Divergent, Maze Runner, etc.) rather than a thoughtful sci-fi. Nevertheless, I really like the presence of Ethan Hawke, John Goodman, and hell, Dane DeHaan too (just wish his character was older in-story)!  Two other things:  * I don't know what the source material is like (and I'm not finding out now because I want the storyline of the film to surprise me), but some footage here makes me hopeful there's more of an ""European"" approach to relationships, so to speak. Countless Hollywood films (and others, taking after them), have a large chunk devoted to establishing romantic relationship between two leads in a very specific and perfunctory way, from first meeting to first sex scene, more-or-less, which ends up feeling really stilted and cookie-cutter, practically interchangeable from film to film. Hoping you'll take your chance to do things differently, and expose your viewers to a broader range of human experience!  * Sci-fi writers are often mocked for overly willing to use crazy numbers,  but here, you might've actually been too conservative in regards to the city of Alpha. You say there are thousands of species in it, and yet its population is 17 million, which is smaller than modern-day Shanghai, Beijing and Karachi (24, 21 and 23 million). Is this some extra-advanced population control at work, or are all other species like elephants, with long lives and slow reproduction cycles? )  Either way, wish you luck!

Star Wars, Mass Effect, you name it they probably in some way ripped off or were inspired by Val√©rian and Laureline, the 1960's comic series, with Star Wars even stealing entire scenes and frames straight from the comic strips. Virtually no one gave the creators any credit for years even though they had basically created the entire sc-fi genre that we know today. Does it look like a generic space opera? Yes? But guess what? All those generic space operas took from Val√©rian and Laureline.

2016-11-14T13:19:04,"FOR THOSE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE LACK OF PLOT RELATED INFORMATIONS IN THIS TEASER READ THIS: ""Valerian et Laur√©line"" is originally a french comics series telling the story of Valerian, a time-space traveler who meets during one of his mission on Earth a young peasant girl from the XI th century: Laureline. Laureline discovers that Valerian is a time-traveler, and so he is forced to take her with him back to the future. Laureline being an independant and impulsive smart-ass girl with a good brain she turns out to be the perfect companion for the always so-cool dependable and diligent Valerian who works for ""Galaxity"", capital of the Terran Galactic Empire. They stick together and we follow their adventures through space and time, adventures filled with monsters, political plots, discoveries, and unforgettable encounters (...and way too much sexual tension).  And it's great! This is the plot of the comics series, so maybe ( I hope!) it will be the same for the movie!

In 1978, this movie was groundbreaking and launched a platinum album the double gate Heavy Metal Album, Featuring songs by Nazareth, Black Sabbath, Sammy Hagar (Heavy Metal), Devo, and Don Felder's Heavy Metal which was a huge hit.  This movie, great expectations for this one.  I was a film major, and yea, I could tear apart many, many scripts but one day I realized, they're just movies and just enjoy them for what they are worth.  Some more than others....or less..

Wtf did they do with this? Fuck no! I can't stand that ""cara"" girl, her face absolutely does not fit the character, plus she has bad hair the whole entire movie, so there's no comb and Pantene anymore? She's not tender and she has no emotions. What the fuck with this? Why ruin this?!!! why? I grew up watching the Cartoon version, and I swear the ending/ and the story line is one of the most beautiful in the world! These actors are shit!!!! I feel like crying. This must be a punishment from God.  And also about this trailer, what the fuck with that stupid slow/sad music? is this suppose to be a clown funeral? wtf with all these incompetence?
