2015-05-17T19:15:25,"Oh, dear.  Why?  Sorry, CGI just ain't scary, unless it is used sparingly and incidentally, as in the traveling matte shots and warped photographs in The Ring.  Even the distorted corpses in that film were done with practical dummies, courtesy of Rick Baker.  You can just TELL.    The original ""Poltergeist"" worked because of Spielberg's storyboards and the actors' down-to-earth, convincing performances.  The suspense was in the shots and the editing--such as the scene with the surveillance camera on the staircase, with the closeup on the iris focusing on the wraiths, which were added later via optical effects.  And the actors were wizards at responding to images that weren't there--likely because many of the set pieces and props (such as the craggy tree and the clown) were done practically.  And the clown in the original, except for a split second when he attacks--didn't have a demonic face--he just SMILED.  And he gave me nightmares for weeks.  Clowns died in 1982--what kid has been seen with one since?  So many questionable choices in this trailer.  A huge, walk-in child's closet with French doors?  So much for claustrophobia.  The imperiled daughter is revealed as an apparition TWICE?  The effectiveness of the first stemmed from our imagining the place where Carol Anne was trapped--when they tried to manifest her as a demon in the first sequel, the scene got laughs.  She is frightening because she isn't seen.  Where did she go?  Where IS she?  We fret for her because she is an innocent victim who is tricked by the demons, who manifest as children to lure her--but we never see what she saw--we have to imagine it.  And when she returned, she was scary enough without resorting to playing freakish Autodesk games with her face, because we knew she had witnessed the devil but wasn't talking about it.  That's scary stuff--without any cartoonish CGI of her getting tossed around the foyer.    And the casting--what a mess.  I must admit that I was excited to see Jane Adams and Jared Harris reunite after Solondz's ""Happiness"", but I didn't expect it in this kind of venue (Sam Raimi does have some taste, clearly).  But in the original, slovenly,  chumpy Craig T. Nelson won everyone over--because no one believed he could land this trophy wife, played to perfection as a hippie-turned-yuppie by JoBeth Williams.  Now we have to accept Sam Rockwell--the ultimate sleazy rapscallion of LA--as a tract home Average Joe, with second-rate moppets as kids?  We all knew there was no way Craig T. and JoBeth would ever produce a flaxen-haired cherub like Carol Anne--which is why she was even creepier, and why we shared their despair in getting her back.  I think they choose these two kiddos based on how well their malnourished hair would respond to static electricity--I took one look at the Carol Anne replicant they chose for this reboot, and couldn't wait for the T.V. to eat her.  The scariest idea in the original Poltergeist--the moment that I suspect inspired the idea of the film to begin with--was the moment when the analogue TV broadcast went off the air, in the witching hour of 2AM or so, and the dark room is suddenly filled with white noise and ghostly static--creating flashing Rorschach apparitions on the walls of the bedroom.  Everyone who lived through that era had experienced that spooky experience--it was amazing to us that no one had made a horror film with that image before, and when we saw it on screen (with Spielberg producing), we knew we were in for a hell of a ride.  Raimi's name is clearly being exploited for similar effect, but thirty years too late--TV never sleeps now, which in itself might have made for an interesting horror story, but the era of Poltergeist went out with Cable Television.    Horror film reboots of classics are all about showing you what was left to your imagination in the originals.  CGI has afforded filmmakers the ability to show ANYTHING--and because they can, they think they should.  They're wrong--the horror film masterpieces of the past achieved their greatness by respecting the fact that what the human mind can imagine is more terrifying than anything that can be shoved in our faces--and when the audience is allowed to collaborate in the film-making process, you can achieve something sublime.  The nightmares never end.    What's coming out of Hollywood these days is no different than the compressed junk being produced for iTunes--it's disposable product, made to excite some neurons long enough to make a buck, then disappear from memory.  How depressing this is for younger audiences, who have been conditioned to settle for such junk.  Thank god we have films from the past still available--I hope kids watch them.  I bet the original Poltergeist still works for them, despite the absence of cell phones and Facebook--because I know that films such as Psycho and The Innocents still give me nightmares, and they came out before I was born.    The only hope I have for this remake is that if will generate some renewed interest in the original--I just pray that they don't sabotage the phrase ""they're here""--and sully our memories of Heather O'Rourke's chilling delivery forever.",0,0,srkbear1,8u2KUpPNIf4,0.07690677966101694,2015-05-17 19:15:25,False,True

You can have the world's greatest visual effects and story plot for a film, but if you don't have the right chemistry between your actors. Then the audience won't invest their time in connecting with the characters and what they're going through.   Something the original movie exceed in, every actor/actress that played the family and surrounding characters all managed to bounce off each other.   I don't know if it was due to the actors/actresses ranges being better or more believable or just the direction of the director being better.   After watching the new Poltergeist for a 3rd time now, originally seeing it in the cinema, I still can't connect with the actors/actresses in this film. It felt more like a mashup of actors thrown together with no believability this was a family.",0,0,APRICEPRODUCTION,8u2KUpPNIf4,0.29480519480519474,2016-12-09 13:54:45,False,False
