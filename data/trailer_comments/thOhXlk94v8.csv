2019-11-08T18:37:57,"Someone help me out on this one.  Years ago, I saw a horror movie that _absolutely_ terrified me in _all_ the right ways, right up until they brought God out of the box. It has a woman who owns a wicker mask.  In the first act, she has an episode that lends credence to the notion that her sanity is uncertain.  In this episode, everything turns dark and sinister, and there is the occasional jump scare, and when it clears up, she and her husband go to see her doctor who increases her medication in the hope that episodes like this will stop happening. Later in the movie, she and her husband are driving through the countryside.  It is late at night, and in cliched fashion, the car runs out of gas.  Neither phone has a signal, of course, so the husband goes for gas and leaves the wife with the car, of course. Well, in cliched fashion, things start to take disastrous turns.  Randomly, the trunk opens.  She has to steel her nerves, and goes back to close it, and the moment she does, she finds several conspicuous gashes across the back.  Fighting down panic, she scrambles to get back inside the car, and the moment she does, a man wearing her wicker mask climbs out of her trunk and starts trying to kill her. She fight him off, jumps out of the car and runs into the woods where several tense moments show him stocking her until she finds a house where four young adults (two male, two female) are playing games. She comes within sight of the house and tries to call for help, but he catches her then, and again, starts trying to kill her.  She manages to fight him off just long enough to get a scream out and this gets the attention of the young adults and they come running. This drives him off. They find her and bring her inside. Now the man with the wicker mask realizes that he has witnesses he has to eliminate and sets about doing so.  He stabs one of the young ladies through her lower jaw, and in so doing, demonstrates that he is not a hallucination.  As her boyfriend is pledging revenge for her death, he is shot by a crossbow that has been bought to protect the house, and dies. I don't remember how the other young man dies, but the other young lady manages to call the sheriff, arms herself with the rifle that has been bought to protect the household, and secures it against any more incursions.  Unfortunately, this means tying up the young lady this man has originally been pursuing and laying her on the couch. Of course, one possibility that has been teased so far is that this man is the woman's husband who has some sort of nefarious purpose.  This is not defeated when the husband finally calls, having gotten back to the car and found her not there.  For some reason, now both phones finally have signals.  Also, he neglects to notice the gashes across the back of the car; gashes that are not exactly inconspicuous.  He calls and the young lady with the rifle answers and explains the situation.  So he comes to the house in the car that now has gas. The car pulls up, he gets out, and for some reason, he takes a cautious note of approach, like he thinks the stairs are booby-trapped, or something.  He examines them as he climbs a few, and there's this really dramatic moment when this hand latches onto his shoulder and we hear the woman with the rifle hiss, ""Get your ass in here!"" Then the two have a conversation in the living room while he _acts_ like he's trying to calm the situation down, apparently under the impression that this young lady is overreacting.  He tries to persuade her to set the rifle down.  He tries to persuade her to leave.  She explains, _""You_ can leave whenever you want but _we're_ not going anywhere until the sheriff arrives."" So he leaves, gets back into the car, and we see the man with the wicker mask in the back seat.  So we now know that these are not the same man, and for just an instant, we now fear for the husband's life.  For just an instant, we tease the possibility that he's just an _idiot_ because he didn't _notice_ the gashes across the back of the car.  But then he looks at the man with the mask and says, ""Fucked up, didn't you?"" And that's when our hearts break.  A voice inside says, ""No!!!!!  I didn't want to hate the husband!!!!  I wanted to believe he was just an idiot!!!  I didn't want to believe that he was actually evil!!!"" The man with the wicker mask takes it off, saying, ""Yeah.  I dropped the ball."" So these two co-conspirators compare notes.  The man with the mask finds out that, as should come as no surprise, the Sheriff is on the way.  And then they make their move. I don't remember exactly how, but the husband ends up dead. The man with the wicker mask and the young lady with the rifle end up wrestling in the living room with the young lady with whom this whole thing started writhing on the couch.  This second detail seems fairly inconspicuous at the time.  Really, I don't know why they added it.  You see, it would've been a perfect ending that would've made for a perfectly complete story if the young lady with the rifle had just knocked out or killed the guy with the mask, or kept him busy until the sheriff had arrived.  Then they could've just taken off the mask and had some surprising reveal where his backstory connects with hers.  But no.  That would've made too much sense.  Instead, it turns out she's having another episode, and oh, look.  It's not a psychotic episode.  It's _a possession!_ Her bonds snap and she rises off the couch and floats in the air!  Her face is now the face of _the Devil!_  Her voice is now the _voice_ of _the Devil!_  She says, ""Is this a _private_ party or can _anybody_ join?"" Right here, the movie is no longer scary.  God, or rather, the Devil, is out of the box.  Why did they have to do this?  Why did they have to suddenly go supernatural?  The movie was doing great without it, and now, suddenly, it's doing terribly. But anyhow, does any of this sound familiar to anyone?  I _want_ to call this movie _Wickerman,_ but all the movies I can find with this title look nothing like it.",0,0,Fauler Perfektionist,thOhXlk94v8,-0.025498338870431913,2019-11-08 18:37:57,True,True

However, he didn't do it because he found out that they were going to dispose of him upon completion and instead went on the run, invisible, and was hunted down etc. Does anybody know what the book was called because I cannot remember at all and cannot find it anywhere. I read it around 2000 so it's at least 20 years old now and I want to read it again. It's on a long list of books I read growing up that I want to reread.
