2017-06-17T15:19:48,"I know what your thinking. This film is going to be great. It will be about a boy who has to cope with looking different and then people will accept him because he is actually a genius. But on the inside this is one of the most generic films this year. You have heard the same narrative before in things like diary of a wimpy kid and middle school the worst years of my life and while this film will most likely execute the trope better, it is still the same trope. Secondly the main character does not need to be disfigured to suit the role you could just as easily had an average person and the story would not change. Remember no matter how much creativity is put into a work, while it does deserve some credit it is still a company. The only reason the main character is disfigured is to pull at your heartstrings and provides nothing but a unnecessary conflict at the start of the movie and then becomes the typical movie I was talking about earlier. Also the other reason they use this in particular is because it is based off a book. They want you to think things like ""oh I read that in 6th grade, so maybe I'll watch the movie that the book has produced"" when really a. If something has to play off nostalgia it may be compensating for something missing and b. If you read this book in 6th grade it might be aimed and suited for a younger audience and not have a complex enough plot line for adults and teenagers to enjoy. I am not saying that this WILL be a bad or even mediocre film I am just saying it has got the hallmarks of one.",0,0,Henry Maccabee,Ob7fPOzbmzE,0.015364583333333345,2017-06-17 15:19:48,True,True

2017-11-12T02:55:35,"This looks like such a great movie; However, I am a pediatric audiologist, and I have to ask: where is this child's Baha? A Baha (AKA bone anchored hearing aid) is a special hearing device for individuals who have hearing loss secondary to external/middle ear abnormalities. This child appears to have atresia/microtia: small/malformed ears with absent or small ear canals. With this type of presentation, I would expect this kiddo to have a substantial hearing loss that would have a severe impact on the development of speech/language and general communication, but it can be easily remedied with a special type of hearing aid. While this movie is doing GREAT things to bring awareness to his condition, I sincerely hope that they bring awareness to the importance of hearing aid as well. Most of my patients are ashamed to wear any type of hearing aid because, let be honest, school-aged children are brutal. Demystifying a hearing aid by portraying it in popular movies/media has the potential to make a world of difference in these children's life.

Auggies eyes are supposed to be low on his face and look as though someone pushed his bottom eyelid down ( not shown in the movie) and he was supposed to have scars all over his face! Summer is Biracial but Auggies didn’t know that her dad was black or African American!!!

He was not waring a Helmet,  he  lost that a long time before he first went to school.  We should not be abIe to tell easily he is smiling, should run across his face.  He should have a mouth like a turtle. They only got the scar and burnt face look. The reason why I am saying that in a angry tone becuase I was not shocked and it looks like a poor representation of the book. subtle references were all over the place to help you imagine but sort of ""wonder"" too. But I know I might sound like hypcrite but that was just poor effort to potray that!! I admit their is no precise picture exactly but you do know for sure its a mush, sqaushed up disaster on his face. When told about his face the characters act like they won't be suprised and braced, but when they see August they get shocked, scared or a bit of both and the adults try to act professional about it and then they get used to it. That is what I thought we would expect on screen.    I was just reading the book, I liked it so much, I liked the atmosphere and I went to see the trailer right now as it was a big coincdence it is coming out when I was reading the book. I was surprised they did not read the book much or it is just a mad man's spin off Iand feel disapointed I mean very sad watching this trailer. I mean I kinda wanted Also Summer looks like a white person, with green eyes and always looked tanned but then when August goes to her house, she becomes suprised to find out she is biracial.   Also, I am going to say the book has to much of a story to tell what I should have been hoping for is a series with all their perspectives but august's one being the heavist one just like the book.  I use to think  book readers who then go on too watch it on TV like Hobbits, Game of Thrones, complaining were just over zelous and over reacting over slight spin offs and changes to the story.

Now to my 5th grade year. Both me and my best friend got the book and 365 Days of Wonder for Christmas. We read that book over and over again. We even read a quote a day all year starting on Janruary 1st. Next my 6th grade year. I wrote an essay about Wonder, which was the 3rd school project I had done on it. My teacher wrote a comment on my writing that it made her cry. Seventh grade next. I did a series of 5 mini projects with it. My teacher was so amazed with what I was able to do with that assignment. Now 8th grade. My best friend and I went with our moms to meet the author. We listened to R.J Palacio talk about her reasoning behind writing the book, then we met her and she signed our books. Now here I am, my freshman year of high school. I have read the book 16 times and completed 5 projects (all As I might add) on Wonder.

And it proves that in a lot of ways those who stand out from the crowd are the stronger individuals... Because they have to overcome what the majority think... In order to prove that their voice matters too. We are all human we all matter... And so does the planet and the animals and birds on it too...nature.  My thoughts are currently solely based off of the trailer...I will be owning this movie very soon. The stories that touch a person's soul and open the hearts and minds of many are to me the best movies in this world.

2017-12-03T21:28:25,"This movie really hits home, with all my clothes on I look like a normal person, but if ever I go to the beach, people literally walk away in fear. Because with colon cancer and Crohn’s disease I’ve had 33 operations on my abdomen and chest, my entire upper torso is horribly scarred, from numerous infections and so many operations. It doesn’t bother me in the least, I’ve beaten cancer three times already, and I look at them is battle scars, reminder of the strength it took to beat this horrible disease, but other people see me and literally turn away in disgust. I won’t even begin to tell you the horrible things people said to me, especially since my small bell now protrudes through my abdomen, and I need to use a catheter to empty my intestine through that towel a.k.a. stoma, eight times a day at least. But again I’m lucky that I can cover it up with a T-shirt, wearing your scars on your face for all the world to see must be the most challenging thing anybody could ever face, I have several friends that, for various medical reasons, have severe facial deformities, and I know the hell that they’ve gone through, and how cruel people can be. Absolutely boggles my mind how anybody could be so cruel and evil to judge and harass people based on something that is totally beyond their control. I always say there’s a special hell for people that cruel, because the people that I know with the so-called deformities, are the strongest most remarkable loving people I’ve ever met my life, and I don’t see any deformity whatsoever, I see courage and strength, and beauty in their own unique way. The worst thing you can do to somebody who doesn’t look like everyone else is to stare at them, trust me, I know how it feels, if you’re curious, then by all means, please ask politely, and I’m very happy to explain it, but when people come up to you and say things like “oh my god what happened to you, that doesn’t look normal!!!” (I’ve heard that one more times than I can count), are usually respond with “what happened to you?, Did your parents drop you on your head when you were just the child? “. I’ve learned to grow thick skin as most people who stand out from the crowd do, at first it hurts, but after a while I just got angry, and begin telling people off, and now I could give a shit, because it’s my life to live not theirs, nobody has the right to judge me except God himself! Getting back to this movie, if it is good as the preview seems, two things are going to happen, first, I guarantee you I will start bawling my eyes out, because it will bring back so many memories for myself, and for those friends of mine who suffered so much, and secondly, I’ll be bursting with pride for the character, and for the people I know, for their incredible current and strength, but also to honour The often downright cruel struggles they face on a daily basis growing up, and even as an adult it doesn’t get much better. The world needs to learn compassion and love, we need to look past exterior appearances, and get to know the person inside. Because I’ve met a lot of beautiful people are just rotten inside, I don’t care how good-looking you are, if you’re arrogant you’re the ugliest person in the world to me, I care what’s on the inside, and I’m not saying that because I’m ugly, are used to be a model in my early 20s, so I’m not ugly, far from it, the only difference being after 3 battles with colon cancer, my hair never grew back, so now I’m bald as a bowling ball, but so much stronger from the experience! The only thing I big all of you, please, if you see somebody who has any type of deformity, for God sake do not stare at them, you have no idea how horrible it makes them feel, if you want to know anything like I said just ask politely, some people may be a little offended, but in my experience most of us are quite glad to give you an explanation if you’re polite about it.I understand it’s human nature to look at the things that we don’t understand or find out of place, it’s an instinctual thing to do, but it’s up to you as to how you go about it, because you can either make a persons day, or make them feel like a piece of shit, what type of person are you?",0,1,Hells Fury,Ob7fPOzbmzE,0.014608351717726712,2017-12-03 21:28:25,False,True
