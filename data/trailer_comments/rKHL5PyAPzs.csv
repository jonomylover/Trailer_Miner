2016-10-09T23:48:48,"In spite of the lackluster quality of the entire film, Underworld Awakening I actually enjoyed the direction it took. How it shifted the conflict from vampires and lycans by including humans as an even more significant threat. Based on the trailer I'd say this element has been removed. Also as fun as it may be to watch, Selene has virtually achieved godhood. In the previous films yes she acquired enhanced abilities by diablorie however she was shown to still struggle, which I do not imagine seeing in blood wars. I fail to for see anywhere for the story to progress beyond this film. The genre has truly been overplayed and tapped to the point of it being a dry vein. I plan on watching this as a final farewell to the Underworld saga. I'd love to see the creative forces behind it consider telling stories about other supernatural creatures.",0,0,Ophelia Sorenson,rKHL5PyAPzs,0.1130952380952381,2016-10-09 23:48:48,True,True

During the last fight scene too, if Selene could just grab Marius' backbone just that easily with one dodge from his attacks, why didn't she do it before?

Where the f@$! is Michael??? I know he's in BWs only now he's no longer played by Scott Speedman but by a new actor which is a bummer but what kind of role will our favorite hybrid have in Blood Wars, big or small??? I really do not like this new vampire guy they got tagging along with Selene at all!!! I totally hope that they do not plan on replacing Michael with this new wannabe!!! 2). Why the hell are The Lycans still being portrayed as villains??? Didn't Rise of The Lycans firmly establish that The Lycans are actually the good guys after Lucian freed them from centuries of slavery by the vampires who are suppose to be the villains of the whole saga due to the events portrayed in the 1st 3 films??? Why is Selene still waging war against The Lycans when she now knows that Lycans were not responsible for killing her Human family & that they are just as much victims of the treacherous vampire covens as Selene herself is???

Hollywood really threw this franchise down the tube. is kate beckinsale refusing to share top billing or something why are all the characters disapearing from previous films . i really dont get why they cut out the relationship part of the movies since it was like the main focus on the first two then completely forgotten in this one and last one. this movie has a lot of unanswered questions. like where is the human cop from the last one. why does it seem like the humans completely forgot that werewolfs and vampires exist. and also why have none of the main character made any headway in stopping a war that has last over a thousand years and 5 movies. there is no progression in these films at all. waste of a lot good characters and actors. review score 3/10 it just adds nothing new to the franchise and takes away a lot of the most interesting that were already there.,1,0,dragonhatcher12,rKHL5PyAPzs,0.09989478114478113,2017-01-06 23:56:59,False,True

2017-02-21T11:43:32,Just finished watching this movie and must point out the 3 major crucial things it lost:   1) It lost its storyline. Underworld always had a very detailed build up in regards to storyline plot. Everything would eventually unravel as the movie carried on. Like it has for the 1st 3 movies. Now it was just mostly filled with needless action scenes. Like every 10 or so minutes they were in another battle. It was just mainly blood and gore and this movie didn't stand on its own.  2) Another thing I loved about Underworld was its racial and cultural diversity. Yet in this version it lacked that heavily. The only thing you got close to in diversity was people pretending to be Elves from Lord of the Rings. Before like in the 1st 3 movies. It really detailed the landscapes as well as the people inhabiting it. This version just used poorly revised old gimmicks and sequences shown from prior movies.  3) It lost is Gothica feel. Before you felt immersed in its world. It had a heavy Gothica feel to it. Now its literally under shows like Shadowhunters(which I find terrible) meets Vampire Diaries(which I also detest). Shows like The Originals would easily outclass this movie and it uses far less violence. The movie lost its tranquil feel. It had a more futuristic approach to movies like *Interview with the Vampire*; which I loved. Yet now it's just Rambo with light bullets and mystical elves.   I kid you not. When you watch this. You'll see they just rewashed all the major scenes from prior version of the movie into this one. Yet they failed terribly at doing so.   I'll just stick with the 1st 3 movies and pretend like I never saw these last 2.  Franchise probably should of died on a high note after *Rise of the Lycans*. Yet they ruined a great thing by dragging it on like *The Matrix* and *Blade*.,4,0,Mind Yours,rKHL5PyAPzs,0.07543010752688172,2017-02-21 11:43:32,False,True
