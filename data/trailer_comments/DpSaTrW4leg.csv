2014-06-19T04:39:17,Wow! This trailer was a-freaking-mazing! This basically further set the tone of the movie and I like how it kinda shows how the war will begin and towards the end of the trailer it shows how it will end also I think there will be 2 showdowns at the end 1. Caesar and Gary Oldman's character Dreyfus and 2. Caesar (again I know) and Koba but I think more than likely Oldman's character might die before he gets to Caesar either by apes or Malcolm who looks to be on the apes side then Koba may try to kill Malcolm witch will make him and Caesar fight all in all I'm super excited to see this! Trailers looked great! The action looks great! I can't wait to see if my ending predictions come true or not but in the end the apes will Be the last species standing!...in the movie only of course lol,1,0,JK 2627,DpSaTrW4leg,0.36217948717948717,2014-06-19 04:39:17,True,True

2014-07-12T15:57:46,"LETS READ THE MOVIE..... Starting in 2018, the wake of the ALZ-113 virus causes the collapse of human civilization. Ten years later, Caesar leads and governs a new generation of apes in a community located in the Muir Woods. While walking through the forest, Caesar's son Blue Eyes and Ash, the son of another chimpanzee, encounter a human. The human, Carver, panics and shoots Ash, wounding him. Carver calls for the rest of his small party of armed survivors, led by a man named Malcolm, while Blue Eyes calls for the other apes. Caesar orders the humans to leave. The remaining humans in San Francisco, genetically immune to the virus, are living in a guarded tower within the ruined city. Prompted by Koba, a scarred bonobo who holds a grudge against humans for his mistreatment, Caesar brings the apes to the city where he orders the humans to never enter ape territory again.  Malcolm convinces his fellow leader Dreyfus to give him three days to reconcile with the apes to gain access to a hydroelectric dam in their territory, which could provide long-term power to the city. Dreyfus, distrustful of the apes, arms survivors using an abandoned armory. Caesar allows Malcolm to work on the dam's generator, provided they surrender their guns. As Malcolm, his partner Ellie, and son Alexander work, they bond with the apes. Meanwhile, Koba discovers the armory and confronts Caesar, questioning his allegiance. In response, Caesar heavily beats Koba, but refuses to kill him and forgives him. Koba returns to the armory and, after murdering two human guards, steals an assault rifle. He then kills Carver, stealing his lighter.  The dam is eventually repaired, restoring power to the city. During the celebration, Koba, unnoticed, lights the apes' home on fire. Caesar notices Koba right before Koba shoots him in the arm, unseen by anyone else. In the panic of the shooting and the fire, Koba claims that Malcolm's group is responsible and orders the apes to war against the humans. Malcolm's group hides as Koba leads the apes to San Francisco. They plunder the armory and charge the tower’s gates. Despite heavy casualties, the apes overrun the tower and imprison all the humans as Dreyfus flees underground. When Ash refuses Koba’s orders to kill unarmed humans, citing Caesar's teachings, Koba kills Ash and jails all apes loyal to Caesar.  Malcolm's group find Caesar barely alive and transport him to his former home in San Francisco. Caesar reveals to Malcolm that Koba shot him, realizing his notion that all apes were better than humans was naive. As he enters the city to find medical supplies so Ellie can operate on Caesar, Malcom encounters Blue Eyes and reunites the two. Blue Eyes then frees the caged humans, as well as the apes loyal to Caesar. The freed apes join Caesar and confront Koba at the summit of the tower. Traveling with the apes, Malcolm locates Dreyfus, who informs Malcolm that his men have made radio contact with more survivors on their way to help fight the apes. While Caesar and Koba battle, Malcolm tries to prevent Dreyfus from detonating C-4 explosives underneath the tower. Dreyfus eventually detonates them; the resulting explosion kills Dreyfus and collapses part of the tower. Caesar overpowers Koba and, while lifting Koba from a ledge, refuses to save him and lets him fall to his death.  Malcolm informs Caesar of the impending arrival of human reinforcements. Caesar tells Malcolm the humans will never forgive the apes for the war they started and tells him to leave with his family for safety. As Malcolm slips away into the shadows, Caesar stands before a kneeling mass of apes, ready to lead them into war.",0,0,Freddy Ripper,DpSaTrW4leg,0.05205627705627705,2014-07-12 15:57:46,False,True

2014-07-18T20:07:05,"I just watched this movie yesterday, and overall it was amazing, but there was one part that really bothered me. Near the end, the apes are attacking a fortified human position with guns they just picked up and never used before. Never once do we see an ape reloading his weapon, just firing off endless streams of bullets from their rifles they are holding one-handed and without aiming. We are supposed to believe they are able to defeat a base filled with heavily armed humans who have been training with their weapons, and many of whom are ex-soldiers.  I would have liked to see the apes win by outsmarting the humans like in the first one, instead of this unrealistic mass assault. ",0,0,Dan K,DpSaTrW4leg,0.155,2014-07-18 20:07:05,False,True

2014-07-19T02:26:12,"Starting in 2016, the ALZ-113 virus causes the collapse of human civilization following martial law, civil unrest and the economic collapse of every country in the world. Ten years later, Caesar leads and governs a new generation of apes in a community located in the Muir Woods. While walking through the forest, Caesar's son Blue Eyes and Rocket's son Ash encounter a human. The human, Carver, panics and shoots Ash, wounding him. Carver calls for the rest of his small party of armed survivors, led by a man named Malcolm, while Blue Eyes calls for the other apes. Caesar orders the humans to leave. The remaining humans in San Francisco, genetically immune to the virus, are living in a guarded tower within the ruined city. Prompted by Koba, a scarred bonobo who holds a grudge against humans for his mistreatment, Caesar brings a large group of the apes to the city where he conveys the message that while the apes do not want war they will fight to defend their home. He then demands the humans stay in their territory and states the apes will too.  Malcolm convinces his fellow leader Dreyfus to give him three days to reconcile with the apes to gain access to a hydroelectric dam in their territory, which could provide long-term power to the city. Dreyfus, distrustful of the apes, arms survivors using an abandoned armory. Malcolm then travels into the Ape Village but is captured by Stoned and his gorilla guards. Malcolm is then brought to Caesar by Stoned and Maurice. Malcolm tries to talk to Caesar but much to his anger is knocked down by Stoned. After he is allowed to speak with him, Caesar allows Malcolm to work on the dam's generator, provided they surrender their guns. As Malcolm, his partner Ellie, and son Alexander work, they bond with the apes. Mutual distrust of both sides gradually subsides but trust momentarily ends when Carver threatens Caesar's sons with a concealed shotgun. The sides reconcile as Ellie is allowed to treat Caesar's ill mate Cornelia with antibiotics. Meanwhile, Koba discovers the armory and confronts Caesar, questioning his allegiance. In response, Caesar heavily beats Koba, but since he does not kill other apes he forgives him. Koba returns to the armory, steals an assault rifle and murders two human guards. He then kills Carver, stealing his lighter.  The dam is eventually repaired, restoring power to the city. During the celebration, Koba lights the apes' home on fire. Then while unseen by anyone else, Koba and Caesar lock eyes as Koba shoots Caesar in the chest, causing him to fall to his presumed death. In the panic of the loss of the Alpha and the fire, Koba takes charge, placing the blame on Malcolm's group and orders the apes to war against the humans. Malcolm's group hides as Koba leads the apes into San Francisco. The apes plunder the armory and charge the tower's gates. Despite heavy casualties, the apes overrun the tower and imprison all the humans as Dreyfus flees underground. When Ash refuses Koba's orders to kill unarmed humans, citing Caesar's teachings, Koba kills Ash and jails all those known to be loyal to Caesar.  Malcolm's group find Caesar barely alive and transport him to his former home in San Francisco. Caesar reveals to Malcolm that Koba shot him, realizing his notion that all apes were better than humans was naive. As he enters the city to find medical supplies so Ellie can operate on Caesar, Malcolm encounters Blue Eyes and takes him back with him to the house. Caesar grows nostalgic examining mementos from his childhood home as Malcolm learns of Caesar's past. Blue Eyes then returns to the tower, freeing the caged humans and the apes loyal to Caesar. After leading the apes to the tower unseen, Malcolm encounters Dreyfus, who informs him that his men have made radio contact with more survivors, located at a military base up north, on their way to help fight the apes. The freed apes join Caesar and confront Koba at the summit of the tower. While Caesar and Koba battle, Malcolm fails to prevent Dreyfus from detonating C-4 explosives underneath the tower. The resulting explosion collapses part of the tower. Caesar overpowers Koba, knocking him to the edge of the tower. While lifting Koba from a ledge, Caesar refuses to save him, claiming he is no longer a true ape, and lets him fall to his death.  Malcolm informs Caesar of the impending arrival of human reinforcements. Both lament the lost opportunity for peace. Caesar tells Malcolm the humans will never forgive the apes for the war they started and tells him to leave with his family for safety. As Malcolm slips away into the shadows, Caesar stands before a kneeling mass of apes awaiting the battle to come.",0,0,Andrew Wiggins,DpSaTrW4leg,-0.03577301251719856,2014-07-19 02:26:12,False,True

I had the misfortune of seeing this trailer before the new transformers movie. Anyone else agree with me?",0,0,SiD taylor,DpSaTrW4leg,0.3036363636363637,2015-07-01 16:49:01,False,False

2019-05-18T19:47:30,"The study published by Science Advances a public, primitive, date to come: the planet of apes is in the process of extinction. According to the latest estimates, 60% of primate species are in danger of extinction because of their human activities and 75% of populations are in decline. As for the great apes, the situation is even worse: 4 out of 6 species are close to extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Scientist working with gorillas since the 2000s, I was optimistic, a few years ago, about the protection of large primates. But I become from day to day more anxious. Deforestation, which destroys habitat for monkeys and other rainforest species, is accelerating. Realize: it disappears by day on Earth the equivalent, in the forest, sometimes and half-city of Paris! At this rate, in 2030, only 10% of the current tropical rainforest will remain. Then, the great apes will not be able to live there anymore. They are particularly vulnerable because of the very low rate of generational renewal: an orang-utter makes a small one every 8 years, a western gorilla every 4 years, a mountain gorilla every 3 years. The weaning times are very long. Long learning is essential for great apes living in unstable forest habitat and with complex social relationships and cognitive abilities. For example, consuming certain types of foods available only at varying intervals, or acts that require tools. Diseases are an extra burden. In the early 2000s, the Ebola outbreak killed 90% of Congo's gorillas and is now critically endangered. Humans, cousins ​​of great apes, are at risk and at risk of transmitting pathologies: a simple human flu is redoubtable for a primate that does not have the right antibodies. For this, we scientists only approach them at 7 meters, and tourists at 10 meters. Industrial agricultural production is harmful. Notably, palm oil plantations in Indonesia, which are deadly for orangutans: more than 60% of their habitat has been lost for 40 years. On the African continent, oil palm plantations have arrived, to the misfortune of local species. But it is also the wars, the mining traffic or poaching that are currently rolling the great apes. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the population of gorillas has been divided by four in the last twenty years. The war, arms trafficking and coltan (colombite-tantalite ore) decimated them. Poaching is a plague that gets worse every year. In the Central African Republic where I work in the WWF-managed Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, something unimaginable and shocking happened: last June, while we were working, a poacher approached 40 meters away despite our presence with the gorillas. He killed Sousa, an adolescent gorilla I knew from a very young age, and tried to slaughter his father with his silverback, Mayele, who came to the first shot. The WWF eco-guards had to keep it overnight and after we had recovered the body, otherwise they would have come to take it and sell the meat. Faced with all these dangers, there are things to do. First, raise awareness and encourage local economy projects based on forest preservation, such as ecotourism in countries where infrastructure permits. It's about getting the message to governments and people in Africa: a monkey has a greater value alive than dead. A tourist pays up to 700 dollars for an hour spent with gorillas! No wonder that ecotourism money is the country's second largest income in Uganda. As for the Central African Republic, do you know who is the most photographed person in the country? It's Makumba, a western gorilla, very difficult species to approach",0,0,amosa mwig,DpSaTrW4leg,0.07272076353598089,2019-05-18 19:47:30,False,False

2020-04-26T18:09:11,"Indeed, I am! I think everyone here is from Plague, Inc. As sick as it may sound, how many of you have been using Covid19 as your virus? I've been using it..and, replicating the exact pattern of it. The numbers aren't good and it usually takes anywhere from 500 to 650 days to completely wipe out the planet. The ""cure"" speed seems to be along the same lines as the news says it will take too. This is basically a handheld ""Event 201"" we playing. Some of the news reports are hilarious though..like ""Politician causes Polygraph to Explode!"" Sound familiar? Sounds like that same retoricol bullshit Trump gives us on a daily basis! It is an interesting and addictive sim though.. you have to admit. The developers really put allot of thought into it. Did anyone notice the colors of the chem trails or boat wakes? If they're white, they're still uninfected..but, if the trail goes RED, from continent to continent, right after, you'll see a bio sign pop right up! It took me a few hundred runs to pick up on that. I guess it's because I'm playing on my phone and it's so small. It's a neat game though and you can play it anywhere. What's scary is that, it mimics real life. The governments collapsing, anarchy,global cure efforts, etc. Who made this anyway? N.I.H.? The CDC?..or worse, The WHO?
