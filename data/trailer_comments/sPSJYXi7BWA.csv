In the book it'll get to points where Tommy is just an annoying over the top guy, and then it'll draw from his past laying out his said story of being an immigrant from Eastern Europe that went to France, Louisiana and finally California. How he loved America and was drawn to films which showed American culture, and how he was beaten and bullied for his love of America. When he was in France he worked in a kitchen where he was constantly verbally and physically harassed, and his friend was deported (they were both illegal).

I mean, good laugh, but so bad! Either way, some time later my sister came to me and told me about ""The Disaster Artist"". I hate watching films in theatres, but I decided to give this one a go. James Franco is basically identical to Tommy Wiseau. This movie is so well done! It might not make as much sense to you if you haven't watched The Room, so I'd say do that before going to see it. Trust me, as bad as the movie is, it will make it that much better. This is one of the best films I have ever seen. It can be funny to the point you can't help but burst out in laughter, then, it goes to a point where you're unsure if laughter is appropriate. It is so well put together and it just a masterpiece in it's own right. It won't get awards or compare to something like The Silence of the Lambs, but in my opinion it is absolutely fantastic! Watch some reviews. Watch The Room. Watch this and be amazed. Fantastic :-)  Edit: It's so crazy as well, Tommy Wiseau is so mysterious. You ask yourself so many questions during it because he doesn't reveal nothing about himself. It's all speculation.

I still cannot believe The Academy of Motion Pictures passed James Franco over for his brilliant performance as Tommy W. The whole thing is so realistic about the way everybody apparently laughed at Tommy's pain and struggles. Typical and awful. Even as he was paying all those peoples salaries. He literally bankrolled his own movie. The laughing as Tommy kills himself really hit home with me. Because in our society SO many people who suffer Mental Illness ARE mocked, laughed at and told to just kill themselves. This is a cold reality and now the current practice of treating depressed people like villains when really they suffer debilitating pain, is NOT the direction to go.  I really hated that part and it bothered me so much!!!--although it is so tragically accurate.  I love the essence and spirit of Tommy and his best friend just deciding to up and move to LA and follow their Dream. The sense of Tommy literally appearing almost out of no where and reaching out to his friend-I thought is a rare almost neverland dream come true-Then the cold stark reality of just trying to make it. The jealousy and friendship deteriorating is very sad.   This movie is incredible!!! James Franco-performance of a lifetime! Absolutely! Knowing his own brother was acting alongside him is really special. They will have that forever.
