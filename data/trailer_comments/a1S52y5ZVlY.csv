I love The OA and The Discovery as they seemed possible (except for The OA at a certain point, no spoilers). But this movie turned into a horror film, which I did not expect. I wanted it to explore deeper into the science or provide a logical premise that is new and surprising so that we can leave the movies in awe and mindful curiosity. For example, Interstellar left me blown away as I am into astronomy and physics and quantum physics and all that was presented seemed plausible. A movie like that makes me curious and it seems even feasible in its science.

I have not seen the original one yet so I can‚Äôt compare it to the original movie, but I thought it was pretty good. The concept of the story is cool I like how when they Flatline they bring something back with them and the only way to defeat it is to make amends to the person that they hurt in the past.
