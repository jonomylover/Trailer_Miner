2016-09-11T16:10:24,"I have kept waiting for it going back to the plot line of heroes vs the villains regardless of species instead of vampires vs Lycans. The fourth one disappointingly undid the first 3 and mostly reset the plot line as if nothing beyond the first 15 minutes of the first movie ever happened. I hoped there would be another one after the 4th but that it would get back to that plot line and be something like Selena, Michael, the daughter and maybe a few others vs All the Vampires and Lycans and establishing and new order. Could have done a lot with factions fighting over the daughter to use her or destroy her.  SThis looks like more of movie number 4.  I don't get it.  From the first movie they new that normal xenophobia was boring and did the plot twist that is part of a story arch that got abandoned before it was finished.  I don't get why they trashed that in the 4th and 5th movies. My guess is that they are going to trash that arch they started with the daughter as well even though should should have been a wholly unique and powerful being based on the series internal logic .  Apparently Speedman will never be in another underworld because he is busy doing, oh that's right, nothing. There is an alternate universe out there where this was a pretty good series.

I mean after a long wait have to admit Awakening the way it played out was onto something a very modern current day feeling of how Vampires and Warewolves would have to face the power of advanced technology (humans) becoming more powerful than either combined with the ability of advanced science and systems. I really think that storyline of a war based upon 3 major species (humans fighting back after generations) shouldn't be abandoned I think that has to continue as the follow on movie beforeit slips away. Or a company say like Fox and Marvel have done and completely take over the screen and render Underworlds future theme useless. If they don't carry it on another industry will. I hope it is Underworld followed these films from day one and loved every last one :D Being a writer myself in the middle of planning a 7 book saga (one day I hope to go somewhere I know my idea) I would focus on the last plot and not merge to many movies with sub movies making it a visual DLC of hell and waiting to see.
