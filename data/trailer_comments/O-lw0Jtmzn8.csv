2014-03-07T22:35:38,"Let me make one thing perfectly clear: I don't give a damn that Annie is black, she could have been any race and I wouldn't care. In fact, this girl seems to have a lot of character and will probably fit the role well. I also don't care about the modernization of the film, remakes have never bothered me so long as they make the film it's own unique thing.  What worries me is this: 1) the casting of the adult characters feels off. Jamie Foxx seems to be doing okay in the clips but he doesn't have quite the same charm as Albert Finney did. Also Cameron Diaz...that's probably the worst casting I can think of. She doesn't even feel like she's trying in this role, and every time I saw her on screen it made me cringe. 2) the singing sounds autotuned. I mean, it's not ""Friday"" levels of autotune, but you can definitely pick up on it. It'd be nice to hear the girl singing naturally, as I'm sure she has a lovely voice. 3) Some of that dialogue, mostly from the comic relief Cameron Diaz, is kind of embarassing. I won't hate the film because of it, but whenever I hear characters say ""girlfriend"" or bring up facebook, it immediately dates the movie and feels silly. It's like those movies in the 90's that threw around ""radical!"" and ""bodacious!"" I don't hate them, it just sounds funny.

The remake of The Manchurian Candidate starring Denzel Washington was fantastic, and his performance was by far superior to that of Frank Sinatra in the original.  One last note, this version was written by the much loved and lovely Emma Thompson, who penned and starred in the beloved Nanny McPhee, and will no doubt do it justice.

2014-03-29T20:04:04,"The reason Annie was a red head in the original Annie was because it challenged (at that time) present views on the Irish community. It challenged discrimination and prejudice by the fact that Annie had red hair and was thus Irish. This was a community that was subject to prejudice at the time. By making Annie African American we are not insulting the previous adaptations, we are modifying them for the present. The symbol of red hair has lost its meaning for present audiences. We no longer see it as a mark of a different community. However, once we look through this lens and examine this new adaptation we notice how poignant and significant having Annie being African American is. It re-solidifies how this movie is about a girl from a disenfranchised community of people. And I can say clearly from the comments on this video, twitter and beyond that racism is alive and well. Annie wasn't just about a cute little red head. Her red hair made her a target. For its original run some members of the audience would have been disgusted with how Annie was a red head. Annie's race in this movie has made her an even larger target. That's why this is important.",47,2,Juen,O-lw0Jtmzn8,0.043242913000977524,2014-03-29 20:04:04,True,True

I prefer the story taking place in the 1933 time zone since it was the time of the great depression, therefore it was common for children to be orphaned or abandoned by their parents because they couldn't afford to take care of them. In today's time zone, parents would be able to get benefits to look after their children until they get a job. So it really doesn't make much sense.   Plus, the older version made better sense of how differently the millionaire's world is compared to the slums of the orphanages, making you feel more emotional towards the orphan children who hardly had anything. As you can clearly see in the beginning of the trailer, the orphans seems to have comfortable beds and some toys, so what can i really say to that?   Also, the way they are just randomly singing in the city kinda reminds me of Enchanted.",0,0,GirlWithThe ArtFolder,O-lw0Jtmzn8,0.07375000000000001,2014-05-12 00:33:25,True,True

2014-08-01T21:50:08,"Annie's red hair was part of the main protagonist's struggle to be accepted. There was a specific reason for this appearance choice - no one wanted to adopt a red headed girl back then. Even today, ginger's have a silent negative stigma. What made the original shine is that her personality out shined her genetics.  You can't remove the iconic red hair and keep the same impact. This is something the makers of this film overlooked as a subtext. Since a black girl can't grow red hair, you can see how having a black Annie won't have the same affect. It would be like if they remade ""Fight Club"" with a completely sane main protagonist. It wouldn't be the same.  Aside from that, having a black Annie is a pointless change, that's technically, in itself, IS racist! On the surface, it may seem like they are promoting diversity, but it's exactly the opposite - The message that's being sent out is ""if the main character(s) of a film are not the same color as you, then it isn't worth watching or enjoying"". I'm sure everyone that's praising this for it's progressive attempt wouldn't be singing the same tune if they remade the movie ""Coming to America"" with a white main cast.

Rogers in World's Great Men of Color in the 1940s -- have made other obvious errors in defending the thesis (Rogers is confused about who Cleopatra's father was, for instance) and make other claims (like that her brother, whom Rogers thinks is her father, had obvious black features) without evidence. Such errors and unsubstantiated claims don't add strength to their argument. 				 A BBC documentary, Cleopatra: Portrait of a Killer, looks at a skull which might be from a sister of Cleopatra -- or rather, the documentary looks at the reconstruction of a skull, since no actual skull was found in the tomb -- to show features which have similarities to both Semitic and Bantu skulls. Their conclusion was that Cleopatra could have had black African ancestry -- but it's hardly conclusive. 				 Conclusions: More Questions Than Answers 				 Was Cleopatra black? It's a complicated question, with no sure answer. It is likely that Cleopatra had ancestry other than pure Macedonian Greek. Was it black African? We don't know. Can we say for sure it was not?

Because during the time it was set/made there was a huge stigma surrounding the Irish immigrants moving to America, and so they gave the young, innocent, hopeful face of Annie characteristics most often associated with Irish people. So yeah, the beloved Annie everyone on here is complaining about being changed? She was originally representative of a 'face' everyone hated/distrusted. So now I ask you a question: what does this say about the casting decision of this film in comparison with modern day society? My answer - take a look at the comments section. I'm really disgusted right now - it's time for everyone to shut up and appreciate this film and extremely talented young actress for what they are worth. Oh and also - don't be so racist. Because to everyone saying 'i'm not racist just don't want a black annie' - ask yourself why. Like really, look inside and ask yourself why, and the general answer you will find is that there is so much internalised racism in our system and society that you idiots can't even see when you're being a disgusting, racist, stupid scum of the earth.

I watched every episode of Good Times, and before that would watch the Jeffersons at night with my family. If Kid Dynomite was remade to be white or Wertimer remade to be black and George J white, I think that would be crazy. But the issue with that is that those were only a couple of black shows in a sea of shows embodied by white culture.  That's where the reading between the lines lies.  Black people didn't have the opportunities to be in the silver screen like white people did for decades before. There were no movies or shows embracing iconic characters as black people. Now they are all used up and it's really hard to come up with new ones because there's only so many possibilities of stories and characters. So remaking a classic (geared more so toward a black audience) is fine.  They were geared towards white audiences for decades and decades. It's a good story. Why not share it between cultures?

Could for example, an orchestra using modern sound recording to play the original score?   To me the issue is not that Sony changed Annie's Race, it is that Annie is an iconic figure. To me Annie is, and always will be an Depression Era story. Yes I know the comic pre-dated the Depression)   If Sony wanted to do an story that paralleled the original but addressing the issues of Modern minority children they could have called it something else, like Annie Revisited, then I might have gone to see that. But their lame attempt to Capitalise on the icon by an attempt to ""modernise,"" including messing with the masterful original musical score is a farse. For example putting a drumbeat to ""Hard Knocks Life"" was just pathetic.

Jesus christ what's next? Pretty soon we are only going to be allowed to buy and sell dark meat and it will be considered racist if we want an all white meat chicken sandwich. I'm probably going to be considered racist for making this comment. I wonder how long it will take for it to become a law where all relationships must be interracial. I like the white Annie movie and I think it is simply weird to make a black version. I also drink white milk more than chocolate milk. But believe it or not I'm not racist.
