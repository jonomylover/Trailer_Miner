Now, I don’t know the actress in the original (I wasn’t born in that era) but in that scene, in my opinion, it seems as if she doesn’t know how to act. The remake, on the other hand, had much more emotion as you’d expect from this type of scene. I mean imagine, the “adoptive parent” builds a relationship with kids they thought was theirs just to find out the harsh reality. Not to mention the kids also build a relationship with that parent so it’s hard for them as well. I watched the original and her covering her ears and her (slim to none) crying seemed unrealistic; it made her look heartless.

My favorite part were the clips playing during the credits.  Eugenio has yet to master acting in English. Sentence structure is different in Spanish than in English, so when acting, your comedic timing will be different.  Eugenio needs to practice his enunciation, I could not understand a bunch of things that he said. This is in part because he tries to act like he acts in Spanish, which is by delivering lines in a fast-paced manner, which does not work in English.  This movie is written with a bunch of Spanish jokes that are not subtitled into English.   This movie is also written for a Mexican/Latino public. Comedy varies from culture to culture. I have not watched it, but I think the dubbed version is better.  Eugenio does not fit this role, he is too old and not attractive enough. There is no chemistry between Farris and him.   The emotional build up is not enough for the emotional climax that it pretends to have.   The characters lack depth, we know nothing about them beyond ""they're rich"" and ""they're poor.""   Eugenio needs to either go full English, full Spanish, or start doing drama. Comedy does not work in multiple languages, whereas drama does (see Man on Fire or any drug lord show).  I speak both English and Spanish, and I did not find this movie funny whatsoever (except for the last clips).",0,0,Chris Ramos,OLAJ0ooorDU,0.054513888888888896,2018-05-17 04:29:23,False,True

Im not hispanic at all but i loved to see a look into the exchange between two different cultures as well as between two different economic classes. The onscreen chemistry between anna and eugenio is just palpable right from the first scene they have together! Although Papi was the antagonist, he was still somewhat likable and hilarious, and all the characters were shown in a positive light, even Magda. The movie was pretty well done in my opinion, and i dont get the terrible reviews. People say the story is mediocre, but this is a romcom. It can be mediocre while remaining incredibly entertaining and worth watching!",0,0,Lusty Not Busty,OLAJ0ooorDU,0.17809580770107084,2020-05-12 11:56:35,False,False
