The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s Amy's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Amy Schumer truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Amy's existential catchphrase “My Vagina!” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Amy Schumer's genius wit unfolds itself on the screen. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  And yes, by the way, i DO have a Amy Schumer tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

I respect overweight people just as much as anyone else, but saying “it’s okay to be fat” is a terrible message to be sending people. Obesity leads to numerous health problems later in life, and encouraging that is a moronic excuse so lazy people can make no effort to make themselves healthier, so instead they just act like being fat is okay. Why isn’t there a smokers acceptance movement? Both smoking and obesity are incredibly dangerous lifestyles to live, but nobody is encouraging people to continue smoking and to accept people as smokers.   So so we’re clear, I am in no way encouraging people to bully overweight people, treat them with as much respect as you would anyone else, I am just saying it is dangerous to encourage people to not make an effort to get healthy.",0,0,MildGonolini,cVx9EFK3DWE,-0.05090909090909091,2018-02-11 21:30:40,True,True

Reality check, people don't normally like fat people because your unhealthy, you probably wont live as long, and the chance of you having any healthy children is slim. I don't hate fat people, i'm just not attracted to people that are unhealthy and only have maybe 20 years to live, its not because society told me that i'm supposed to hate fat people.

Her confidence goes over the top to make a point for the movie, but it is true that more women should have confidence regardless of whether they fit a typically airbrushed and humanly unattainable image currently en vogue.  Over the centuries and continents, the definition of female beauty will always change.  But our confidence should be steadfast.    Others are attracted to confident people, whether Madison Avenue would agree they have the “right” to be confident or not.  Why should women leave it up to the fashion industry (or anybody else) to decide if they are a worthy human or not?  No one was born morbidly obese.  We were all born at a healthy enough weight to be delivered.  If we were worthy humans as babies, why would extra pounds added later suddenly make us subhuman?  If Amy lost 40 pounds ya’ll would be singing her praises.  There are a lot of Shallow Hals (and Shallow Hollys) out there.  Personally I don’t think Amy’s weight is that high.  That could disappear in 2-3 months.  I’m glad she is a little pudgy & relatable.  In real life, despite her real (current) weight, Amy IS this confident character she portrays.  It may be because she was not always pudgy, so she has a vision of her best self in her memory banks, and bases her confidence off of her basic self, not the current extra 40 pounds, which can come & go.  Also her self confidence is based on other factors besides her appearance.  You would HAVE to have a lot of unshakeable confidence to be a stand-up comedian and actress.  She has a lot to be self confident about.  She is talented, smart and hilarious.  This movie will do good.  I hope to see more women having more confidence going forward.  God says we are all worthy.  Oh, but the majority have turned their backs on God — ooops!  Mistake.  Our Creator is where true confidence originates...  PS:  I think it’s awesome how the super thin girls don’t know how to respond when a larger female has more confidence than they do.  PPS:  I find is hypocritical that some of the same ppl who gush online over the beauty of people who have been disfigured or are disabled in some physically obvious way, will turn around and criticize a very beautiful woman for carrying extra weight.

A better protagonist would see this nearing the climax and realize that all women, even skinny women, are affected by beauty standards. Another important thing, the protagonist shouldn’t have to bump her head and rip her hair out just the “see she’s pretty”. A better plot would be if the protagonist creates a social commentary on beauty standards. She would realize that she’s beatiful just the way she is through lessons she observes through events, strangers, and close friends, like finding a skinnier girl crying in the bathroom about low self esteem and social pressure to fit a mold.

The only thing I would advise against- is to judge yourself to be attractive to other people.  That's their choice, not yours.

Of course there is a level of beauty and attractiveness over this in terms of face and body (minka kelly kind of : ) for example) but this does not refute the beauty of this lady.

If you look back in time like the 70s and 80s women were by no means obese but they were not skinny either. The idea of women being skinny came after the stupid industry in Hollywood started promoting it to be beautiful and sexy. I really don't know what people want, if they see a fat person doing nothing they criticize and if they see people at gym doing something about it they laugh at their bodies. Come on just get a life! If you're fat and works for you: good! If you're skinny and works for you: good too!

I dislike Amy Schumer and I wasn't expecting much but I saw it because I liked the premise. It is filmed like a disney channel film, often cheesy, pretty much nothing artistic about the lighting, the soundtrack, the best friends trope and hot guy trope and dumb blonde trope etc. But I truly think this film was made to be a rom-com, and that's why I also don't think the feminist criticism of it- that it shouldn't be painted as comedy that heavy woman finds herself attractive- holds any truth here. It wasn't completely filmed as if to mock her, as if she's delusional. It was just that- a romantic comedy. Both style wise and fat-acceptance wise. I liked it. It was strangely inspiring. And I think if there were to be ""bad"" films like this out there at least they should have a good message like this one.
