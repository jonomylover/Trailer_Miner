2016-08-17T20:32:23,The Hunger Games is a trilogy. The first movie is interesting. This  adventure movie makes you feel you are in a very weird world. The main  purpose is to survive the hunger games that some people have been  selected to represent their districts. Most of the performances  represent crazy people. The cast included Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss  and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. I think it is worth it to watch it.,22,0,Diana Benzo,mfmrPu43DF8,0.06666666666666667,2016-08-17 20:32:23,False,False
