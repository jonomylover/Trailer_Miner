[did anyone else notice? that the wife and mistress were both using brosnan for the bad boss but are never referenced together? as if the plot would fall apart if mentioned, aside from the plot hole mentioned above] why didnt brosnan and or the brit cop, invite jackie to see all what they are doing to find the bad guys? so in the end, jackie is just as bad but he heralded as a hero by the audience.  nobody else gets this? maybe brosnon should have invited jackie in on the hunt and let the old man surprise them with his skills.  good acting, good directing, nice dialogue, stupid plot holes. if jackie's character was deleted from the movie, it would have not made any difference. no one would have noticed.  finding the bombers was all the movie needed.  jackie only brings the movie down and there wouldnt have been a plot hole.",0,29,tom ster,om9YCk7ufHs,-0.0744444444444444,2017-12-10 07:00:17,False,True

I'm afraid, the film makers were trying too hard to make another ""Taken"" movie. If I was the screen writer, I would add more flashback  scenes about the relationship between the father and his daughter. You have to explain why the father went so far as he did in this movie. Sure, he loved his daughter because she is his daughter. But what exactly makes her so special that he risks his freedom to avenge his daughter? In the real world, you would go to prison when you hunt down criminals by yourself. So why did he do that. I would have love to see more than just another ""Liam Neeson"" character played by a Chinese actor. This film should have been carried out more carefully.

The reason I bring this up is that he was supposed to be 61, making him born in 1931 and thus was in his 30s during the Vietnam War.  Very doable to be in special forces at that age.  However, in 2017 a 61 year old person would have been born in 1956, and thus would turn 17 when the conflict ended in Vietnam, too young to be in special forces.  In the book he served with the Americans so it had to be before 1973.  So in the book they did not have the GPS and cell phone technology.  Plus there were no CCTV on every corner in London.  So the movie takes place in the present but never explain how a 61 year old fought in special forces with the Americans in Vietnam.",0,0,Jane Felix,om9YCk7ufHs,0.15714285714285717,2020-06-01 01:25:33,False,False
