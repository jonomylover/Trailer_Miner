Jesus answered   and said unto him,    Verily, verily,   I say unto thee,    Except a man   be born again,    he cannot see   the kingdom of God.    (John 3:2-3).    ***The fact that Nicodemus came to Jesus by night may reveal the timidity of his faith. (12:42). However, his faith was developing. (John 7:50-51)<---Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?) (John 19:39)<---And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight).    ***(Born again): The Greek word translated again can mean either ""from above"" or ""anew."" The new birth, or regeneration,    (Titus 3:5)<---Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the (Holy Ghost), is the act by which God imparts spiritual life to one who trusts Christ. Without this spiritual birth, a person cannot perceive spiritual things, (1 Corinthians 2:10)<---But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God). (1 Corinthians 2:13-16)<---Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ), nor can he or she enter the kingdom of God. (Verse 5).    (BORN AGAIN):    (Gk. gennao anothen) (3:3,7) Strong's #1080; 509: The Greek word anothen translated here as again could also be rendered ""from above.""  The birth that Jesus spoke of was either a new birth or a heavenly birth---or both. It seems that Jesus was speaking of a heavenly birth because he later used the analogy of the wind, coming from some unknown, heavenly source, to depict the spiritual birth. But Nicodemus clearly understood Jesus to be speaking of a second birth--being born again. Jesus explains this new or heavenly birth in 3:6-8, contrasting being born of the flesh with being born of the spirit.",0,0,mlzanercik,5MwW1NAsnR8,0.004997086247086243,2019-05-14 13:20:29,True,True

The point of the first movie (Maleficent) is that there is a lot more to the story then a petty fairy who tries to kill a little girl for the sole reason of not being invited to her party. So no Disney didn‚Äôt just make her good and then changed their mind to make her evil again. They gave her a backstory, and made her more human and relatable. We now can empathize what she went through, and see her eventual ‚Äúevil deeds‚Äù in a new light. She was always to become ‚Äúevil‚Äù with a sequel or not, thats the story we know.

2019-05-15T01:42:08,"Seems like she's become ""evil"" in the eyes of outsiders while trying to protect Aurora's joint kingdom while using some means that are definitely not ""good."" As in her means  would not be like a hero but more of an antihero so Aurora rebukes tells her she needs to stop and they get into a fight. All the while this other kingdom tries to take over. That's my best guess and probably how her title mistress of evil came about. Basically the lore of her title.  I wish they did something about her name though. I mean Maleficent literally means evil while she is (not saintly but) good.  Either if in the first movie she was named something else and adopted that name to scare off the enemy king or this movie it explains that this is how her name became the dictionary definition of evil to other countries and that is the origin of the word.

2019-05-15T02:17:53,"ourforgiveness.c*o*m  ""End Times"" Friends, harken unto my words. Bible prophesies are being fulfilled, the early birth pains are on the rise ""For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these¬†are¬†the beginning of sorrows.‚Äù¬†(Matthew 24:7-8). Christianity is being suppressed worldwide by the increasing number of new laws that oppose conservative christianity values, by self-deceived philosophers who make no mention of Christ as the means for salvation; and by New Age propaganda such as: spirituality, consciousness, chakras, meditation, enlightment, law of attraction, scientology, and prosperity preaching. ""Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves"" (Matthew 7:15). ""And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light"" (2 Corinthians 11:14); he is a liar, and a murderer. Be not deceived, ""Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them"" (Matthew 7:20). For the Lord has said "" My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:¬†And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand"" (John 10:27-28). I encourage you friends to do some basic research, and you will see that a cashless society is at the horizon. And the microchipping of humans is already here, and sooner than later the following words shall come to pass ""And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name"" (Revelation 13:16-17). Ask yourself how much do you love money, ""For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows"" (1 Timothy 6:10). Now, who among you seeks after power and fame?, ""For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?""(Mark 8:36). Time to wake up friends, the world is not going to get any better, even if religious leaders try to unify and coexist; for Jesus said ""Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword"" (Matthew 10:34), meaning, He came to separate the believers from the non believers. He also said, ""...I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"" (John 14:6). Jesus is the the ONLY way to Heaven brothers, all other religions are false and will not save you from endless torment, for what communion does Jesus have with Allah?, or what righteousness is there in Shiva or Belial? Nay', Isay. ‚ÄúNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.‚Äù¬†(Acts 4:12). We need to encourage and persuade other faiths to embrace the good news of salvation that is through Christ. Do not be deceived friends, but rather examine yourself and see what is causing you to love the world, for it is written: ""Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.¬†For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world"" (1 John 2:15-1). Your life, my beloved, is but a mist ""Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away"" (James 4:14). Therefore, do not waste any more time with foolishness. Some of you have children, think about their souls, think about the hard times to come. Awaken my brothers, and let the Almighty God redeem your soul, arise from the shadows of darkness and sing to the LORD, be not ashame of righteousness, justice, and holiness. Strive ye to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Behold!, now is the time of grace, Now is the time salvation, Take it! while it is still offered.    To the believer: ""Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."" (2 Timothy 2:15). And remember to pray for the lost souls, even as satan uses them to oppress and persecute us, ""For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.""(Ephesians6:12). Our commission, brethren, is to preach the Gospel of Christ. And let us also bring hope and comfort to the weak and destitute. Be wise therefore how you present the Gospel to different types of people, and do not compromise your purity.   To the spiritually lost: Turn to God and ""If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."" (1 John 1:9). And ""...if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."" (Romans 10:9) ""For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."" (Luke 11:10)  read the New Testament. ***  All glory be to the Most High God.  Jan 20 2019",1,0,ourforgiveness *com,5MwW1NAsnR8,0.13300537618245953,2019-05-15 02:17:53,True,True

2019-05-15T03:21:16,"If you read this it was meant for you! Act today no one is guaranteed tomorrow! Time is very short!‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèªYou are Loved more than you know!! Question: ""What are the essentials of the gospel message?""   Answer:  The word gospel means ‚Äúgood news,‚Äù which is the message of forgiveness for sin through the atoning work of Jesus Christ. It is essentially God‚Äôs rescue plan of redemption for those who will trust in His divine Son Jesus Christ in order to be reconciled to a just and holy God. The essential content of this saving message is clearly laid out for us in the Bible.   In the apostle Paul‚Äôs first letter to the Corinthians, he lays out the content of the gospel message, ‚ÄúNow, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures‚Äù (1 Corinthians 15:1‚Äì4).   In this passage, we see three essential elements of the gospel message. First, the phrase ‚Äúdied for our sins‚Äù is very important. As Romans 3:23 tells us, ‚ÄúFor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.‚Äù The reality of sin needs to be acknowledged by all who approach the throne of God for salvation. A sinner must acknowledge the hopelessness of his guilt before God in order for forgiveness to take place, and he must understand that the ‚Äúwages of sin is death‚Äù (Romans 6:23). Without this foundational truth, no gospel presentation is complete.   Second, the person and work of Christ are indispensable components of the gospel. Jesus is both God (Colossians 2:9) and man (John 1:14). Jesus lived the sinless life that we could never live (1 Peter 2:22), and, because of that, He is the only one who could die a substitutionary death for the sinner. Sin against an infinite God requires an infinite sacrifice. Therefore, either man, who is finite, must pay the penalty for an infinite length of time in hell, or the infinite Christ must pay for it once. Jesus went to the cross to pay the debt we owe to God for our sin, and those who are covered by His sacrifice will inherit the kingdom of God as sons of the king (John 1:12).   Third, the resurrection of Christ is an essential element of the gospel. The resurrection is the proof of the power of God. Only He who created life can resurrect it after death, only He can reverse the hideousness that is death itself, and only He can remove the sting that is death and the victory that is the grave‚Äôs (1 Corinthians 15:54‚Äì55). Further, unlike all other religions, Christianity alone possesses a Founder who transcends death and who promises that His followers will do the same. All other religions were founded by men and prophets whose end was the grave.   Finally, Christ offers His salvation as a free gift (Romans 5:15; 6:23), that can only be received by faith, apart from any works or merit on our part (Ephesians 2:8‚Äì9). As the apostle Paul tells us, the gospel is ‚Äúthe power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile‚Äù (Romans 1:16). The same inspired author tells us, ‚ÄúIf you declare with your mouth, ‚ÄòJesus is Lord,‚Äô and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved‚Äù (Romans 10:9).   These, then, are the essential elements of the gospel: the sin of all men, the death of Christ on the cross to pay for those sins, the resurrection of Christ to provide life everlasting for those who follow Him, and the offer of the free gift of salvation to all.   What Does Faith Mean?   Faith is one of those words that is commonly used but not always understood. Some of that confusion comes from the many different ways the word faith is used in everyday conversation; a quick look at Dictionary.com shows seven different uses! One common way that people use the word faith is to refer to belief in something despite lacking any evidence for it. But is that what the Bible means by faith? The answer is a resounding no! So, when the Bible uses the word faith, what does it mean?  The closest that the Bible comes to offering an exact definition is Hebrews 11:1: ‚ÄúNow faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.‚Äù From this particular passage we see that the central feature of faith‚Äîconfidence or trust. In the Bible, the object of faith is God and his promises. A clear example of this is Abram's encounter with God in Genesis 15. In response to God's promise of countless descendants, Abram ‚Äúbelieved the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness‚Äù (Gen 15:6). Commenting on this, the Apostle Paul writes, ‚ÄúNo unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised‚Äù (Rom 4:20‚Äì21). Thus, faith means putting your trust in God and having confidence that he will fulfill his promises.  Faith is more than intellectual agreement. To use an old illustration, imagine you are at Niagara Falls watching a tightrope walker push a wheelbarrow across the rope high above the falls. After watching him go back and forth several times, he asks for a volunteer to sit in the wheelbarrow as he pushes it across the falls. At an intellectual level, you may believe that he could successfully push you across the rope over the falls, but you are not exercising biblical faith until you get in the wheelbarrow and entrust yourself to the tightrope walker.  Genuine biblical faith expresses itself in everyday life. James writes that ‚Äúfaith by itself, apart from works, is dead‚Äù (James 2:17). Faith works through love to produce tangible evidence of its existence in a person's life (Gal 5:6). Put another way, the obedience that pleases God comes from faith (Rom 1:5, 16:26), rather than a mere sense of duty or obligation. There is all the difference in the world between the husband who buys his wife flowers out of delight and one who buys them simply out of duty.  Faith is so important because it is the means by which we have a relationship with God: ‚ÄúFor by grace you have been saved through faith‚Äù (Eph 2:8). Faith is how we receive the benefits of what Jesus has done for us. He lived a life of perfect obedience to God, died to pay the penalty for our sinful rebellion against God, and rose from the dead to defeat sin, death, and the devil. By putting our faith in him, we receive forgiveness for our sins and the gift of eternal life.  So, faith means relying completely on who Jesus is and what he has done to be made right with God.",0,0,King Of the Couch,5MwW1NAsnR8,0.12678072468656884,2019-05-15 03:21:16,True,True

You want evil Maleficent? Oh, we‚Äôll give you evil Maleficent!  Sigh... fine.  I appreciate that Disney has amped up the production quality of its sequels, as opposed to the laughable direct-to-video sequel period of the 90‚Äôs (thanks, Eisner), buuuuuut... a sequel is still a sequel. A safe investment. A regurgitation of material that, in this case, wasn‚Äôt that good to begin with.  And to be clear, this is a sequel to a live-action remake of an animated adaptation of an original fairy tale. Yeesh.  I mean... not to sound too entitled, but could we at least get a couple more live-action remakes of animated classics before we start getting sequels to remakes?

And five of them   were (wise),   and five   were (foolish).  They that were foolish took their lamps,   and took (no oil) with them:  But the wise took (oil) (in) (their vessels)   (with their lamps).    (Which we know here is that, the Oil represents the HOLY SPIRIT!! And as it says in (Hebrews 1:9)<----Thou hast (loved righteousness), and (hated iniquity); therefore God, even thy God, hath (anointed thee) with the (oil of gladness) (above thy fellows). (Acts --5:32--)<----And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath (given to them) that (OBEY HIM). (2 Thessalonians 2:7-8)<----only he who now letteth will let, until he be (taken out of the way), (Which is the Holy Spirit). And then shall that Wicked one be revealed, (Who is the Anti-Christ). (Hebrews 13:5)<---- for he, (Jesus/Holy Spirit), hath said, I will never (leave thee), nor (forsake thee). (1 John 4:4)<--- Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is (he), (Jesus/Holy Spirit), that is (in you), than (he), (Satan), that is (in the world).  (The Holy Spirit Filled, Wise Virgins, will be taken and will not have to deal with the Anti-Christ, but the FOOLISH virgins will, and will have to be Killed to get into the Kingdom of Heaven.  (Revelation 6:11)<----- it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their (fellow servants) also and their (brethren), that (should be killed) (as they were), should be fulfilled.  (Revelation 20:4)<----and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God). (Jesus): I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I wish you were cold or hot. So then because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth. (Revelation 3:15). (You have to be on fire for Jesus and not for this world or YOU WILL BE LEFT BEHIND!!!)    While the bridegroom tarried,   they all slumbered and slept.  And at midnight there was a cry made,   Behold, the bridegroom cometh;   go ye out to meet him.    Then all those virgins arose,   and trimmed their lamps.  And the foolish said unto the wise,   Give us of your oil;   for our lamps are gone out.  But the wise answered, saying,   Not so;   lest there be not enough for us and you:    but go ye rather to them that sell,   and buy for yourselves.  And while they went to buy,   the bridegroom came;   and they that were ready   went in with him to the marriage:  and the door was shut.    (The Door was shut): Speaks of being shut out of the kingdom of heaven. The unwise virgins were not ready when Christ returned).    Afterward came also the other virgins,   saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.  But he answered and said,   Verily I say unto you,   (((I know you not))).*****    (The repetition of LORD, LORD, indicates strong emotion).  (Matthew 7:21-23)<----(JESUS): Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  And then will I profess unto them,   (((I never knew you))):******  depart from me,   (ye) that (work) (iniquity).

2019-05-16T23:26:57,Those aren‚Äôt Ravens. Those  are other dark fairies like Maleficent you can see that there are bodies attached to those oversized wings. In the shot were there all flying together. Which makes me think that the film this time is gonna center around Maleficents lineage. For in the first film we are lead to believe that Maleficent is the last of her kind. Which is proven false by the trailer. Another thing is that first shot of the trailer were you see a silhouette of a horned figure that isn‚Äôt Maleficent because the horns are standing straight up there not curved at the sides like Mals. Which leads me to believe that that scenes takes place in the beginning of the film (and is a flashback) were those men are trying to steal something from what I think is the Moors. Then I think you‚Äôll see some type of altercation and find out that figure was Maleficents mother and the fight is the reason why Mal was left alone from birth. Which is shown at the beginning of the first film. I also think the this new queen is gonna actually be the main antagonist because from what it looks like she feels threatened by Maleficent and tries to kill her while they‚Äôre seated at the table. For u see that during that moment in the trailer Maleficent starts off seated then notices something is wrong which is the guards are being sent after her (most likely by the queen) then she rises up and blasts them with her magic. Lastly I think that Maleficent seeks out her kin initially to recruit them for the final confrontation which is shown at the end of the trailer were the dark fairies are fighting along side Maleficent by spraying that reddish mist in the air. (I also think that The queen knows about the other fairies and she seeks to wipe them out which I think will be the driving motivation for the plot) Leading me to think that she becomes something similar to their queen or leader gaining the title mistress of evil. Due to perhaps her kind having a tendency to give in to evil urges.,0,0,Janluther P,5MwW1NAsnR8,-0.011102403343782652,2019-05-16 23:26:57,True,True

Yes come July hopefully we'll see Scar striking a deal and forming his alliance wit them, also more of his time as ruler of the Pridelands. Yet what about after? What about when Zira got banished? What about Janja's clan? Are they in fact decended from Shenzi? Is Shenzi Janja's mother? Is Banzai his father? Is Ed the father of Cheezi? Sucks that may never happen I feel.

I was disappointed that he was reduced to a prop with no character and no purpose but to be pretty. Maleficent wouldn't even let let let him ride his own horse, she knocked him out and had him carried as a piece of luggage. How ignoble. The movie had much going for it but it was grating how the feminist revisionism sought to make amends for superficial female characters in earlier eras (though not in _Sleeping Beauty)_ by going to an extreme in the other direction and dehumanizing the men. The men shown to be unnecessary to the women, who were willing to live together happily in the forest without men forever. I was almost expecting a lesbian wedding between Maleficent and Princess Aurora at the end of the first film. We may just be a remake or two away from seeing that.  I really liked the rationale for Maleficent's curse and her backstory, so I hope this sequel builds on it's strengths with complex and surprising.character development.
