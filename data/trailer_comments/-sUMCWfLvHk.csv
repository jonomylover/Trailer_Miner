Lyriq was also in Four Brothers movie with Mark Wahlberg, r&b music singer Tyrese Gibson, music rapper Andre Benjamin of Outkast, Terrence Howard, Chiwetel Ejiofor¬†and Taraji Henson. Taraji was wrong for trying to kill Lyriq Bent and his black woman. When Lyriq was trying to start his own business. Taraji wasn't supporting him because he didn't have money. But then when Lyriq started making money with his business. Taraji got mad because he became rich LOL. Lyriq decided to be with another woman LOL. I don't blame Lyriq for leaving Taraji because he got tired of Taraji's bad behavior. Taraji's bad behavior towards Lyriq Bent is so typical of black women. Black women wonder why black men hate them LOL. The young black girl who was Gabrielle Union's daughter in Breaking In movie played Taraji as a young girl in Acrimony.
