Juno was just horrible (I really like Ellen Page but hated her character as well as everything about Juno) and I tried to give United States of Tara a chance because I like Toni Colette but I was very disappointed.   This movie will probably have the usual Diablo Cody dialogue of contrived pop culture references and how younger people are more insightful and know more about life than older people. Even the title is so contrived.   And this is definitely NOT original. Like some other commenter state...Mary Poppins.    I am definitely skipping this one and I really like Charlize Theron.    Diablo Cody is so unoriginal and all her scripts are better suited for Hallmark made for tv movies or the once popular After-school-specials back in the old days.,0,0,S.

2018-01-18T09:53:03,Women in underdeveloped and developing countries do 14 hours jobs and take care of kids without any social support or health care. But sure go ahead and make a movie about how previledged women in richest countries of the world are exhausted of motherhood. Well done Hollywood. Keep up the good job of making women everywhere in the world essentially hate their bodies. Hey you simply can't manage a job and motherhood simultaneously . I am done watching mothers going crazy on screen. My mother is a Professor and she brought up 3 kids in an underdeveloped country just fine. I don't need this Hollywood nonsense.,0,0,P.
