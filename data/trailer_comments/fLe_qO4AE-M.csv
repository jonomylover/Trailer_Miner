2013-12-11T18:28:44,"This movie is nothing but another Hollywood whitewash.  This movie is based on the Japanese sci-fi novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" and the original character in it was a young Japanese soldier. Instead of giving the lead role to an Asian American actor Hollywood continues its racist practice of marginalizing nonwhite actors to just stereotypes and supporting actors in favor of white actors.  Warner Brothers previously did this with Argo where the real life person that Ben Affleck was playing was Latino, they want to do it with Akira by whitewashing the Japanese characters and now they have done it with this movie here.  The ironic thing is that in the original novel there was a female character who was a white American meaning you could've still have a white person in a lead role if you followed the characters' ethnicities as in the original novel but the fact that Warner Brothers and Doug Liman whitewashed the main character from a young Japanese character to Tom Cruise shows that Hollywood is a white supremacist institution.﻿",8,13,DaRunningMan,fLe_qO4AE-M,0.08977272727272728,2013-12-11 18:28:44,True,True

The action of Edge of Tomorrow unfolds in a near future in which an alien race has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world.  In the beginning of the story, Cage is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again and again.

Afterall, in Groundhog Day Bill Murray is possibly the most talented human being in North America by the time he gets tomorrow... 4) I'm looking forward to this. Also looking forward to Prototype.

Though, that still didn't stop _Groundhog's Day_ from being a good movie.  To be perfectly honest, people _do_ come up with similar premises quite independently. I know I sure had an idea similar to the ""dream-hacking"" concept donned in _Inception_ while still in high school back in 2003.  And gamers/writers everywhere probably sighed at seeing _Wreck It Ralph_ come out with ""their idea.""  It happens.

2014-01-29T16:02:44,"well for those who says its like a certain game that's because the the author of the book ""All You Need Is Kill"" is a gamer and written in the afterword of the book ""I like video games. I’ve been playing them since I was a snot-nosed kid. I’ve watched them grow up along with me. But even after beating dozens of games on the hardest difficulty mode, I’ve never been moved to cheer until the walls shake. I’ve never laughed, cried, or jumped up to strike a victory pose. My excitement drifts like ice on a quiet pond, whirling around somewhere deep inside me. Maybe that’s just the reaction I have watching myself from the outside. I look down from above and say, “After all the time I put into the game, of course I was going to beat it.” I see myself with a shit-eating grin plastered on my face—a veteran smile only someone who’d been there themselves could appreciate. The ending never changes. The village elder can’t come up with anything better than the same, worn-out line he always uses. “Well done, XXXX. I never doubted that the blood of a hero flowed in your veins.” Well the joke is on you, gramps. There’s not a drop of hero’s blood in my whole body, so spare me the praise. I’m just an ordinary guy, and proud of it. I’m here because I put in the time. I have the blisters on my fingers to prove it. It had nothing to do with coincidence, luck, or the activation of my Wonder Twin powers. I reset the game hundreds of times until my special attack finally went off perfectly. Victory was inevitable. So please, hold off on all the hero talk. This is the sort of thing that went through my head while I was writing. Without the help of a great many people, this novel would never have made into this world. It’s a dark story, with characters dying left and right, but I’m happy with how it turned out.""",2,0,death72,fLe_qO4AE-M,0.1304138321995465,2014-01-29 16:02:44,True,True

2014-02-28T07:55:12,"These are some of the differences between the movie and the novel (All You Need is Kill) (spoiler warning at the last points) - The setting is in Japan - The male protagonist is a 20 (ish)-year-old Japanese recruit named Kiriya Keiji. At the end, the U.S force soldiers gave him the nickname ""Killer Cage"", that seems to be where Tom Cruise's character's name comes from. - The ""Jackets"" (power armor) is full-body like those seen in Iron Man or Starship Troopers: Marauder. - Rita (Emily Blunt's character) wields a giant battle axe, not a sword. And her armor is bright red from head to toe. - In the novel, Rita never trained Cage. They meet, fully aware of each other's ""condition"" for a grand total of 2 ""rounds"" (The novel ends at the last one, Cage's 160th try). - ** MASSIVE SPOILER ** The ""reload"" ability belongs to the alien race (called Mimics). Roughly speaking, they possess the ability to ""send"" their memory to the past when they suffer too much losses, or if they don't achieve an acceptable victory. Rita and then Cage, by sheer luck, killed the ""transmitters"" and somehow were able to ""hijack"" that ability, sending their own memory to their past. Cage's loops only happened because in every single loop, Rita was able to kill a crapload of Mimics to guarrant a ""reload"". So an early plot hole spottable from the trailer is: Why did the Mimics ""reload"" when they clearly have blown up Rita, a legendary soldier with topmost kill count, and the one with knowledge of their secret? (In the novel, they purposefully target the two protagonists after learning about them) - ** SPOILER ** The novel's ending is not happy.",0,0,Jeremy Carl,fLe_qO4AE-M,0.0828817733990148,2014-02-28 07:55:12,True,True

This was a movie starring Tom Cruise who is a great actor and does wonderful action movies. The Edge is about time travel and good vs evil and man vs himself all in one.  This movie was fantastic. I will not spoil anything, there are 500 other reviews for that. This was what guys should watch not(insert Tyler Perry movie here/Twilight/Transformers).  This movie doing poor in theaters, same with Pacific Rim, signals the end of guy movies and Sci-Fi. The new male audience is less intelligent...I call them the Apple crowd.  This IS A MUST WATCH!!!!  Excellent performances, top notch camera work and great sci-fi/action flick. Guys need to be men again. Sad movies are not made for men any more.
