All other items must be treated in some way. Bag all clothes and linens and remove from room. Reduce clutter off the floor so that all areas can be thoroughly treated. Be careful not to transfer bed bugs from room to room by carrying things throughout the house. If the mattress and box spring are in very bad shape or heavily infested, they should be replaced or covered with a Bed bug proof mattress cover, or a Bed bug mattress encasement. We also carry Bed bug box spring encasements. Infested bed sheets and garments should be washed and dried in a household dryer on high heat (the heat will kill bed bugs), or discarded since these items cannot be treated with insecticides. In really bad infestations, where the bugs may be infesting personal items (stuffed animals, soft toys, blankets, books), you may need to contain the items in an air proof bin and add vapor strips to the bin to eliminate the Bed bugs on these items.",0,0,Patrickann777,aPzvKH8AVf0,-0.19749999999999995,2017-05-29 04:32:43,True,True
