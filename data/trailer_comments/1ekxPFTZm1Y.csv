2015-08-09T10:12:22,so happy to see more Irish in films Celtic history has been destroyed and taken by many unrelated people's and nations.  Italians and Irish should be friendly to one another as northern Italy was for a time Celtic land.  if you go to Dubrovnik Croatia Ragusa has many native freckled red people I am not sure if they came after the fall of Rome from the Germanic tribes or after Napoleon but there are many Celts that live in Old town Cavtat Croatia.  hopefully Hollywood will reinstall the Celtic legacy of middle Europe and Asia Minor.  and they are not just in Ireland there everywhere these Celtic where extremely adventures. ,0,0,Moonsabie,1ekxPFTZm1Y,0.1990909090909091,2015-08-09 10:12:22,True,True

Looking forward to seeing it as I'm in it playing a 'rude' Irish immigrant in the Thanksgiving Day Feast scene ... I'm a wee bit 'testy' and quite naturally fond of me liquor, and if I made the cut and therefor remain to be seen in close attendance to the resonant Irish voice of Irish Singer, Iarla O'Lionaird, as well as being being soundly chastised by Father Flood, played by Jim Broadbent. Ach, it was a grand day … touching you might say for it brought me back to my roots, somewhat, for it was in 1952 that we emigrated to Canada from Scotland. I hope you'll take the time to see the movie when finally released and to let me know how you felt about it.",3,1,David Robertson,1ekxPFTZm1Y,0.15664335664335663,2015-10-23 20:39:33,True,True

Instead it focuses more on the settling aspect of the story. You see this immigrant struggle so much with the concept of home. This is the protagonist's journey towards finding her identity, her home, her heart. You see her struggle with America.  As an immigrant myself, i identify with this movie so much. The hopes of the country, the bitter reality, the longing to be home, family, friends, new life, new job. The movie and Saroise perfectly captured the entire transformation. I know art is what is perceived by the eye and mind BUT i really really wished people would stop saying it is a love triangle drama. It is not. It was not shot that way.

Where are the real difficulties of living abroad in a different culture, where no one understands the little things that belong to you, where foreigners are often seen as a threat...? It seemed to me a little condescending that after a limited period the main character had already forgotten her past to fully embrace her new life. It takes ages – if that is ever possible – to overcome that feeling of longing, the sense of not belonging somehow... one's soul divided between two countries.
