Well, apparently, you're suppose to say a prayer before you play with the board, and if you don't, you could attract evil spirits or even demons. We didn't know this rule at the time. So we just started playing. I asked if I was talking to my grandmother, it said no. So immediately I told my friend to stop pushing it, and when he said he didn't, I didn't believe him. So, I asked it who I was talking to. It didn't tell me who. All it spelled out was ""YOU'RE FUCKED"" and then me and my friend stood up, and just looked at the board while the FUCKING THING WAS SPELLING SHIT OUT BY ITSELF. It was spelling ""You're going to die tonight"" ""You're mine bitch"" ""Fuck you"" all this crazy shit, then the board lifted up by itself and flung to the wall. Immediately me and my friend ran out of the fucking house, and we stayed at my house. Well some crazy shit started happening there too, until eventually we found out how to destroy it.
