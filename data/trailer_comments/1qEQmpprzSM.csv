I looked into what the white rabbit symbolizes and here’s what I found “The White rabbit represents the hollow. And hollow defines emptiness and the opportunity to be filled. If you are furthering your own spirituality at this time, you will have the support. If you are delving into the unknown through fear with inner courage you are being commended. Do not fear the changes you are making dear one. The rabbit reminds you to step forward through your fears, as you will begin to experience the mystical, metaphysical and supernatural aspects even more, now or in the coming times.” I’m going to assume that the family isn’t as connected as they should be and through encountering themselves they learn to love each other more. Them showing up is the change that they need to grow a stronger family bond thus realizing that all we need (all they need) is us",38,12,Mir Redd,1qEQmpprzSM,0.15833333333333333,2018-12-25 14:30:09,True,True

You can see some imperfections in a few scenes on them,  maybe the boys face was burned or maybe it just didnt form properly.

(i.e. the mom trying to get her son on rhythm, the father getting the boat, etc). Then after seeing all the rabbits — a symbol for procreation/family/lineage/fertility— I think there's a metaphor somewhere about this new generation of middle-class suburban Black families still trying to hold onto Black urban culture when they're far removed from it (i.e. The parents playing ""I got 5 on it"" while driving to a vacation house with their white friends at the beach).

2018-12-26T05:35:09,"Theory: What if the plot is not about you being your worse enemy but it's a parallel universe where being good and pure is the norm vs. a society where evil and temptations are widely except. Take for instance how the characters are portrayed, the normal/good family are viewed in a light. You can see it in how they are dress, bright and light colors, and almost every frame where they don't encounter their doppelgangers, it is bright/good. While in this parallel universe they dress in red which could represent evil/temptations. Their norm is doing whatever deep dark desire they have, for example the doppelganger boy has a fixation on fire. There's like 3 shots were he's seen with fire, the one where he was walking through the fire, when he was in the closet with the other boy, he was holding a lighter I think, and the third shot where they showed a close up on his face and it was burned. That could represent his evil desire. The doppelgangers could be seeing the normal family as threats to their norms and understanding of the world and that's why they're hunting them or the complete opposite. The doppelgangers might be there to show the good family that it's ok to embrace their dark/evil tendencies. There's 2 parts of the trailer that can support this: 1. Where the evil mom doppelganger tells the good family to 'be careful'. Why would she warn them if they were against them? And the part where the two boys were in the closet playing with the fire and looking at each other. The doppelganger didn't look threatening but as if he was showing the good boy their possibly shared fascination with fire. The doppelgangers seem to be somehow connected with the scissors. There was that scene where they were holdings each other's scissors which could symbolize being unified/separate idk.

Most likely its a metaphor for families in the Black Community having to resist the urge or the struggle with resisting falling into the temptation of becoming the so-called ""demonic"" version that *WHITE* Society will be deemed as unfit, unstable, unacceptable, or unsuitable for Americanized *white* Culture and Standards... Its a Black-American Family.... more BLACK... than actually AMERICAN... maybe considered TOO BLACK by some.... And a result of Isolated Toxic Tribalism in the Black Community/Black Family structure/unit.... Think of it...  It all started with a old-school ""RAP"" song about ""Drugs"" that was just suppose to be a cool song and was harmlessly & inadvertently trying to come across as ""cool/hip/innocent"" to young black children of THIS Generation who have no idea what that ""LIFE"" was about... But Black folks 35+ know and we consciously struggle with ""THAT LIFE"" and the temptation it brings with listening to the lyrics of old school hip hop songs that remind us of where we come from and how far we've come in spite of whatever modern injustices occurring in the Black Communities.... It's like, ""Should we let them listen to it? Should we change the station? But the song is dope! But is it actually about dope?? Wait... what should I do??? My kids are here listening to it...😬""...  Its like fighting this other evil version of themselves is a representation of there inner-struggle to fight the urge and resist there own default toxic tribalistic nature against a semi-water-down institutionalize-rascist society in 2019...

2018-12-29T14:02:34,I'm realizing something after having a conversation with my cousin. She was saying White directors just don't know what to do with us in horror films. So they just kill us off because we get too loud and make too much sense of the insidious horror. They don't even know how we will react in such situations in horror films. This makes sense for a lot of Hollywood with these horror films. White directors think the way they do because it's their reality. This is why I'm thankful for Jordan Peele because not only is he black but he is casting black characters and we are getting great horror/thrillers that are not cheesy in any way. We need more black directors serious and passionate about horror that can actually cast black people. Maybe this is why some black people don't like scary movies because they don't find them realistic and don't find the characters relatable but Jordan has been doing something.,753,34,Andre Taylor,1qEQmpprzSM,0.015789473684210534,2018-12-29 14:02:34,True,True

2019-01-10T14:00:05,"Well, somehow i feel this movie is similiar to one of Japanese Comic(Manga) named ""Summer Time Render"".  It's about  people having attacked by their body double in some island.   The Protagonist/ MC of this Japanese comic is a teenage boy whose friend died in accident many years ago, many believe she is died by accident from drowing in the sea.  However after years, he met his friend again, but this time there are two person with exactly the same body and face that looks similiar to his friend.  Turn out One is the real one, however the other one is the fake. They realized that the fake one is the one behind the drowning accident years ago and it is trying to kill his friend as it trying to replace the real one. However even after years missing the girl miraculously alive out of time. The MC then figured out that something terrible about these creature. It not just one but many. Turns out many human populace in that island also has been killed and have been replaced by these creature whose able to copycat their body exactly like their victim.  Even the protagonist started to being targeted by his body double.   This body double, whatever they're called also desrcibed exactly like this movie version explained. They're us, they think like us, they know where we we are, and they're  not going to stop until they kill us.  I don't know what, but when i see that the Comic has already released years before this, i can't give any creative vibe for the author of this Movie.
