2016-09-20T14:21:45,"While I don't understand why distributors can't take the time to upload multiple versions of a trailer to different social media platforms, I thought I'd clarify WHY there is a brief five second ""teaser"" before the actual trailer. This is done because on sites like Facebook or Twitter, an ""auto-play"" function is typically the default video playback option. So the studio's thinking here is that they have five seconds to summarize the trailer so that someone scrolling past the video will have their interest caught more efficiently than perhaps seeing an establishing shot, etc. It's a more recent marketing tactic, but it's definitely becoming prevalent. Like I said, I don't understand why the studios don't just take the time to upload a version of the trailer with the extra preview at the beginning specifically to sites like Facebook and Twitter, and then leave the original version to sites such as YouTube. I guess, like I said earlier, it's just to ensure that even if someone shares the video from YouTube on Facebook, they can captivate as wide an audience as possible. Of course, this leads me to question if studios will begin shortening trailers as a whole. You know, rather than spoiling the whole movie in two and a half minutes. The movie trailer industry is great at what it does, but I feel like we need a huge overhaul in regards to the way we go about marketing films these days. Almost every trailer is structured the same, and too many of them continue to spoil plot points or surprising scenes that would've been better seen only at the theater. My suggestion is that, rather than trying to summarize the plot of the film, trailer companies begin to market the aesthetic and tone of the film. Perhaps through showing a snippet of a dialogue scene, and then showing a brief montage of interesting scenes from the film without any actual context.",0,0,Colby King,7BWWWQzTpNU,0.16048387096774192,2016-09-20 14:21:45,True,True

(2 Corinthians 4:4) among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers  (John 14:30) I will not speak with you much more, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has no hold on me.  The world is quite literally under Satanic influence (Revelation 12:9) and as a direct result, his spirit feeds this world. It is a blanket that covers the earth and affects every living human. This power and control give Satan and his followers (demons) a significant amount of fearlessness. However, the one thing they fear is the one thing they cannot control: their eventual deaths (Revelation 20:10). At this moment, Satan and his followers are imprisoned in a cell called earth (Revelation 12:7-12).

Read some spoilers in the post and was kind of fuckin hyped for the movie. Loved the concept, this is going to be a dope movie... But, this trailer kind of ruined that feeling for me. Simply by the look. What I'm sayin is I disike that it lacks true grit, I guess. It looks like the characters are in a five star hotel and not a space-ship.

I can tell you, I've read Jon Spaihts' (amazing) script and the trailer doesn't spoil anything. I was surprised of a few things that happened in the script and none of those surprises are in this trailer. This trailer simply shows you that two people have woken up on a spaceship and they soon fall in love. Sure, there's going to be action, it's set in space, it'd be really boring if it just focused on Jennifer and Chris' characters.  Can't we just be happy that, in the midst of all the remakes & sequels we've had this year (far too many to count), we're getting a film that is fresh and original. It's not like Wall-E, it's not like 'Titanic in space' and it's not like Gravity. Just because they feature romance and it's a sci-fi doesn't mean it's going to be unlike any other film we've already seen.  Who cares if you don't like Jennifer Lawrence or Chris Pratt? In my opinion, I find Pratt to be annoying but that won't stop me watching this film as I've been looking forward to it for the past year.  See the film, don't see the film, it's up to you. Please don't moan that it's spoilt everything because it hasn't, I promise you. It's impossible to include the whole film (90-120mins long) in 2min26sec long trailer.

The Republican Party is two-faced and gutless, and illegals are everywhere. I want it all fixed!  I don't care that Trump is crude. I don't care that he insults people. I don't care that he has changed positions. I don't care that he's been married 3 times. I don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly and Rosie O’Donnell. I don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslin terrorist. I don't care if the guy has bad hair.  Our country has become weak, bankrupt. Our enemies are making fun of us. We are being invaded by illegals.  We are becoming a nation of victims where every Tom, Ricardo, and Hassid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in.

I just want this thing fixed.   Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money controlling him; he doesn't have political correctness restraining him; all you know is that he has been very successful; a good negotiator; he has built a lot of things; and, he's also not a politician.   He says he'll fix it.

Maybe he's ex military and sold everything he had in order to get a ticket on this ship in order to hatch his plan.

2016-09-30T07:49:32,"Neisseria meningitidis, often referred to as meningococcus, is a gram negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia, a life-threatening sepsis. The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their nasopharynx.[1] As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly Africa and Asia. It occurs worldwide in both epidemic and endemic form.[2] N. meningitidis is spread through saliva and respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, and chewing on toys. It infects the cell by sticking to it with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc and has several virulence factors. Meningococcus can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease.[3] It initially produces general symptoms like fatigue, fever, and headache and can rapidly progress to neck stiffness, coma and death in 10% of cases. Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis are easily confused with those caused by other bacteria, such as Hemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.[4][5] Suspicion of meningitis is a medical emergency and immediate medical assessment is recommended. Current guidance in the United Kingdom is that if a case of meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia (infection of the blood) is suspected intravenous antibiotics should be given and the ill person admitted to the hospital.[6] This means that laboratory tests may be less likely to confirm the presence of Neisseria meningitidis as the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body. The UK guidance is based on the idea that the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reduced chance of death. Septicaemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis has received much less public attention than meningococcal meningitis even though septicaemia has been linked to infant deaths.[7] Meningococcal septicaemia typically causes a purpuric rash, that does not lose its color when pressed with a glass (""non-blanching"") and does not cause the classical symptoms of meningitis. This means the condition may be ignored by those not aware of the significance of the rash. Septicaemia carries an approximate 50% mortality rate over a few hours from initial onset. Other severe complications include Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome, a massive, usually bilateral, hemorrhage into the adrenal glands caused by fulminant meningococcemia, adrenal insufficiency, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.[5] Not all instances of a purpura-like rash are due to meningococcal septicaemia; other possible causes, such as Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; a platelet disorder) and Henoch–Schönlein purpura, also need prompt investigation. N. meningitidis is a Gram-negative bacterium since it has an outer and inner membranes with a thin layer of peptidoglycan in between. It tests positive for the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase.[8] Habitat[edit] N. meningitidis is a part of the normal nonpathogenic flora in the nasopharynx of up to 5–15% of adults.[9] It colonizes and infects only humans, and has never been isolated from other animals. This is thought to stem from the bacterium's inability to get iron other than from the human sources transferrin and lactoferrin.[4] Subtypes[edit] Disease-causing strains are classified according to the antigenic structure of their polysaccharide capsule.[10] Serotype distribution varies markedly around the world.[11] Among the 13 identified capsular types of N. meningitidis, six (A, B, C, W135, X, and Y) account for most disease cases worldwide.[12] Type A has been the most prevalent in Africa and Asia, but is rare/ practically absent in North America. In the United States, serogroup B is the predominant cause of disease and mortality, followed by serogroup C. The multiple subtypes have hindered development of a universal vaccine for meningococcal disease. Virulence[edit] Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the outer membrane of N. meningitidis. This acts as an endotoxin and is responsible for septic shock and hemorrhage due to the destruction of red blood cells.[13] Other virulence factors include a polysaccharide capsule which prevents host phagocytosis and aids in evasion of the host immune response; fimbriae mediate attachment of the bacterium to the epithelial cells of the nasopharynx.[14][15] It infects the cell by sticking to it mainly with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc.[16] Meningococci produce an IgA protease, an enzyme that cleaves IgA class antibodies and thus allows the bacteria to evade a subclass of the humoral immune system. A hypervirulent strain was discovered in China. Its impact is yet to be determined.[5] At least 8 complete genomes of Neisseria meningitidis strains have been determined which encode about 2,100 to 2,500 proteins.[17] The genome of strain MC58 (serogroup B) has 2,272,351-base pairs. When sequenced in 2000, it was found to contain 2158 open reading frames (ORFs). Of these, a biological function was identified for 1158 (53.7%). There were three major islands of horizontal DNA transfer found. Two encode proteins involved in pathogenicity. The third island only codes for hypothetical proteins. They also found more genes that undergo phase variation than any pathogen then known. Phase variation is a mechanism that helps the pathogen to evade the immune system of the host.[18] The genome size of strain H44/76 is 2.18 Mb, and encodes 2,480 open reading frames (ORFs), compared to 2.27 Mb and 2,465 ORFs for MC58.[17] Both strains have a GC content of 51.5%.[17] A comparison with MC58 showed that four genes are uniquely present in H44/76 and nine genes are only present in MC58. Of all ORFs in H44/76, 2,317 (93%) show more than 99% sequence identity.[17] The complete genome sequence of strain NMA510612 (serogroup A) consists of one circular chromosome with a size of 2,188,020 bp, and the average GC content is 51.5%. The chromosome is predicted to possess 4 rRNA operons, 163 insertion elements (IS), 59 tRNAs, and 2,462 ORFs.[19] Genetic transformation is the process by which a recipient bacterial cell takes up DNA from a neighboring cell and integrates this DNA into the recipient’s genome by recombination. In N. meningitidis, DNA transformation requires the presence of short DNA sequences (9–10 mers residing in coding regions) of the donor DNA. These sequences are called DNA uptake sequences (DUSs). Specific recognition of these sequences is mediated by a type IV pilin.[20] In N. meningitidis DUSs occur at a significantly higher density in genes involved in DNA repair and recombination (as well as in restriction-modification and replication) than in other annotated gene groups. The over-representation of DUS in DNA repair and recombination genes may reflect the benefit of maintaining the integrity of the DNA repair and recombination machinery by preferentially taking up genome maintenance genes, that could replace their damaged counterparts in the recipient cell.[21] N. meningititis colonizes the nasopharyngeal mucosa, which is rich in macrophages. Upon their activation, macrophages produce superoxide (O2¯) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Thus N. meningitidis is likely to encounter oxidative stress during its life cycle.[22] Consequently, an important benefit of genetic transformation to N. meningitidis may be the maintenance of the recombination and repair machinery of the cell that removes oxidative DNA damages such as those caused by reactive oxygen. This is consistent with the more general idea that transformation benefits bacterial pathogens by facilitating repair of DNA damages produced by the oxidative defenses of the host during infection.[23] With a fatality risk approaching 15% within 12 hours of infection, it is crucial to initiate testing as quickly as possible, but not to wait for the results before initiating antibiotic therapy. A small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is sent to the laboratory as soon as possible for analysis. The diagnosis is suspected, when gram negative diplococci are seen on Gram stain of a centrifuged sample of CSF; sometimes they are located inside white blood cells. The microscopic identification takes around 1–2 hours after specimen arrival in the laboratory.[3] The gold standard of diagnosis is microbiological isolation of N. meningitidis by growth from a sterile body fluid, which could be CSF or blood.[5] Diagnosis is confirmed when the organism has grown, most often on a chocolate agar plate, but also on Thayer-Martin agar. To differentiate any bacterial growth from other species a small amount of a bacterial colony is tested for oxidase, catalase for which all clinically relevant Neisseria show a positive reaction, and the carbohydrates maltose, sucrose, and glucose, in which N. meningitidis will ferment that",2,1,Sen,7BWWWQzTpNU,0.002107237422771401,2016-09-30 07:49:32,True,True

Listen, the guy wakes up years ahead of schedule, and then with nothing to do, he walks around and stumbles upon a pod with the Jennifer Lawtrence character in it. Thinking she was hot, she started to stalk her on the internet, and like tracking her entire life watching all her videos and articles. He then wakes Aurora up, effectively forcing her to live out her life with him.  And then didn't tell her that part and so she didn't know, and after a while she sleeps with him. I kept waiting for the part where he realises he's actually the antagonist instead of the protoganist but no. After she finds out about the dude after months of him cyber stalking her and then ripping her out of er life to force her to live the rest of her life solely with him, she starts running like hell.She's literally running from him but she can't escape. So he chased her down. And because he didn't respect the need for space that she needed after finding out what he did, he broadcasts his 'apology' over like the speaker thing and his apology was something like: what i did was wrong, but you are so beautiful, can you really blame me? I thought that this was all going to lead to the film using his actions to discuss Jim’s sense of entitlement and his violation of Aurora. But no. And plus, Aurora is constantly sexualised, and is always in some bikini or something sexy for the camera to leer at. Jim though, is never ogled. Instead, his nudity is presented as a joke. She’s ever-ready for sex, doesn’t own sweatpants, and is smart and funny, but not so smart or so funny that Jim feels threatened by her. When it comes to fixing stuff, she’s so clueless her only job is holding the flashlight. Even her rage over Jim’s betrayal feels part of his fantasy. His guilt demands to be assuaged, so she has to be angry at him, but not for too long. After all, they still have space banging to do.",25,13,Georgia Jansen,7BWWWQzTpNU,0.1045591974163403,2016-12-21 12:39:07,False,True

2016-12-30T09:56:33,"Guys I'm going to be honest I LOVE the movie in terms of visual effects, the story is interesting, but for the same thing that I liked a lot the information they gave was very superficial, I would have liked them to give more ... if you too leave you with many gaps, leave your questions here and between all of us try to solve them ... if they did not give us enough information, we try to fill them with our theories and I will leave some doubts here ...  1. In the movie let us know that the ship is in ""automatic"" form so from there you stay that ""Irresponsible"", however advanced the technology could be made by humans so it is exposed to have failures , What I would have thought to myself is that for example the first 20 years were piloted or supervised by crew members, after 20 years these people were put in capsules to hibernate and woke up new people from the crew previously trained to do The same (so did not die in the ship and all workers would come alive to the new planet, clear 20 years older).  2. There were only 5000 passengers, so I think it was a limited number so the selection of people to travel would have liked more information about how the election process was, what were the requirements etc ... The character of Chris made it ""discount"" because he was going to render his services on the other planet so we can think that it was like barter type, we give you a place and you give us your job in the future. Aurora had the neatness of the Gold Class so they let us think she has a lot of money to afford her own trip.  3. I read in several forums that said that Chris's character had hired him to render his services in the new world but that would be kind of stupid because the knowledge he had would be 120 years old when he arrived ... But to this I I say no, if we consider that it is a new world where they are going to start from 0 to say type when the man lived in the caves but he was going to have many years of knowledge, do not they?  4. I have a Theory: That the Character of Chris woke up was not a mistake, the ship knew that  had a problem so decided to wake up someone who knew how repair it, an Engineer but with this doubt my theory is coming a bit down ... If the technology was intelligent enough to wake up someone to repair it, would not it have been better to wake up instead of a passenger to one of the crew? The only thing that would support my theory is that the crew knew how to detect the problem and not fix it and that's where the knowledge of Chris's character would come in!  As I said it is a movie that I call quite the attention and I would like to see what opinions, doubts or questions have about it, greetings People = D",6,1,Sagapoalex,7BWWWQzTpNU,0.23608676046176047,2016-12-30 09:56:33,False,True

Furthermore, the barman's malfunction depicts that they are not reliable enough.  Robotic repairers would have perhaps failed, just like the barman & the malfunctioning cleaner robots.  There are 5000 passengers and over 200 crew members, which would more than likely encompass engineers etc.  Another negative comment was ""One medical capsule for 5000 people!"" Its just a fucking movie.  They could have made 5000 medical capsules & made 4999 of them out of service due to damage, to follow through on the story line.  It comes to the same thing.  My countries population is 23 million, but is there 23 million operating theatres & 23 million surgeons to serve everyone!  There isn't even 23 million beds - nowhere near it!  This type of critique should be reserved for a documentary on a prospective spaceship for intergalactic travel, such as the one depicted in this movie.  This is only a movie, not a real prospective spaceship.  Another negative comment was ""Water pool on space craft!"" Almost every 5 star hotel & resort has a pool.  Why wouldn't you have one in a spacecraft?   Its almost a necessity in space, as a form of fitness.  Another is complaining about the joystick used in a scene, which I wasn't even conscious of.  You want to flush 99% of a movie because of one scene?  Get a life duds.",5,5,falconeranatolia,7BWWWQzTpNU,-0.11944444444444445,2017-01-10 14:36:28,False,True

The Autodoc can suspend someone back to sleep (""hibernation"") so that someone can live to see homestead 2 and not die on the ship. The only problem is that there is only one Autodoc. This is all given information at the end of the movie.  HOWEVER. If they were smart, they could space it out. Space out the time. One person can be in hibernation for 40 years, then they will be woken up by the other person and trade off. Aurora can go into hibernation first for 40 years, then Jim wakes her up and then goes into hibernation himself. Sure at the end they'll end up being in their 70s or so by the time they get to homestead 2, but the point is that they both live...

He and the girl are both good looking and there's been put a lot of effort in the CGI fest that this movie is. But the love story is so generic as well, I quit watching this movie when I wasn't even halfway through.  About the technology and physics this movie seems entirely impossible. I get that it's set in the future, but nothing about the technologies seemed probable, next to that the physics in this movie seemed completely inaccurate. Take for example the seen that the ship's gravitational systems have a failure. The Aurora swims in the pool and the water starts floating in a bubble.

I mean, fair enough it does put her in a position of possibly being stuck alone with a guy she might not like, and who probably wants to sleep with her but as it turns out she really is attracted to him., His despair and loneliness is completely understandable and her shock and anger at finding out he lied to her is too. Leaving aside the question of why a ship with 5000 passengers has only one med bay, when Jennifer Lawrence's character is offered the chance to go back to sleep she realises that the adventure she had planned, leaving her friends behind to write the ultimate time travelling story, was an empty attempt to live up to her father's legacy and unlikely to bring her any happiness.Having been faced with the terrifying prospect of being alone herself for the rest of her life if Chris Pratt's character died, she has an insight into what drove him to wake her and is able to forgive him.

The movie ended too quick.  If they returned back to sleep then it would have been possible to make a sequel.

The trailer says at the end, ""There's a reason we woke up early."" From this point on, I was expecting the android to be that reason, to be a twist in the plot since the android was there and active when Jim woke up first. What a bummer that the rest of the movie played out as nothing more than a romance and the cause of Jim waking up was simple malfunction due to holes in the ship from meteor strikes.

Many things shown  in this movie made me wonder if there would be a better alternative for a  certain function, but the more I look into it, the more things made  sense. The scientific aspects of this movie are amazing and more  accurate than I expected. The low gravity interactions with objects are  well choreographed. The artificial gravity created by the spinning  sectors of the ship are theoretically accurate as well.  <Spoiler Alert> Amazing  movie, but it does have its flaws. Jim could have easily opened  everyone's hibernation pods, just as he opened Aurora's. Then, he could  have more company and Aurora wouldn't hate him as much. Also, at the end  of the movie, it would have been better to see Jim and Aurora's  children or grandchildren welcoming everyone who just woke up and I was  anticipating that. This trailer is rather misleading in making you think  that alien interaction was involved, but none were. It wasn't as  amazing as I had hoped, yet it was better than I expected.  9.5/10 - would watch again.",10,2,░KenLinx░,7BWWWQzTpNU,0.2784863945578232,2017-05-05 08:54:17,False,False

Cast Away in space? It tried to be all three but it didn't blend the elements of any of them very well and in the end the movie had no guts to do something a little different. It could have been good, it really wanted to be the problem has everything to do with the writing and maybe a little directing. SPOILERS AHEAD They wrote themselves into a WTF Problem by saying the pods never malfunction, ever. The titanic conundrum. They make it sound like spare parts would really help them out and that's all it is. BUT they briefly mention how when they were put to sleep it they were in a facility and it sounded very controlled and technical. Something their Pods couldn't do. But instead of that being the focus of the problem it's just ""It doesn't break so don't bother with spare parts"". If they wanted it to be more of a space thriller they should've started the story with Aurora waking up and we the audience only know what she knows. Just that he was alone for a year and her pod malfunctioned. It would've been a lot creepier and focused on the emotional development of Aurora being trapped on a ship with a man that essentially hid the truth to develop a romantic relationship with her. After she found out they could've focused on her coming to terms with their situation and sympathizing with Jim as she learns how he felt being so alone. Later in the story instead of Jim just finally figuring out a solution so he can begin to fix problems they just write another character into the story holding a skeleton key and really contributes little to the narrative other than ""Oh yeah remember the ship is malfunctioning? Here's what you have to do and I died with only 10 minutes on screen and you're supposed to feel bad for me because I had a lot of health problems."" Even though there are a few scatterings of minor malfunctions with the ship they kind of just ignore it. Until the problem gets severe. Even then they waste time to save an Android instead of using that time to save the ship.  There's no creepy atmosphere there's no real feeling of these characters feeling alone it's kinda written as boredom rather than complete loneliness. This movie has no guts to end Jim so Aurora can further understand his complete loneliness while also learning from it.   Nope it's just 116 minutes of different genres slapped onto pages with little tendrils trying to tie them together in ways that really don't work.

Lastly, the trailers gives too much vibes from Mass Effect, and specifically with Mass Effect : Andromeda, and that only about the cryoponds,  but to my humble opinion, it is even more dark and serious than the game and with a totally different theme in the story line plus, a romance/friendly/platonic? relationship between the two.

Xperia Z2 was a good try. But even HTC got everything better there. If they made something with standart specs + SONY extraspec camera and better or same stereo like the HTC one m8 has id be buying that sh*t. Although an SD slot is important. Not as much as the IP68?

2019-04-09T18:43:44,"Passengers, quite simply, shows us the difference between humans and robots. While the latter may lay claim to cognitive intelligence, they fall short and come nowhere close to our capacity for morality, empathy, love and the entire gamut of human emotions - some of our finest and worst qualities as humans; especially as regards decision making, which often have several different complicated layers other than the logical.  When Jim contemplates waking Aurora prematurely, it was borne of a selfish need for companionship, but which to Arthur, the android bartender, seemed only logical - a fitting solution to a pressing problem without the unnecessary handicap called morality. Again, when Aurora falsely declares that there aren't any secrets between Jim and her, Arthur sees fit to correct that impression, not for the sake of right or wrong, but because of how illogical the claim was.  He's indifferent to how either feels. He is incapable of comprehending them, seeing events only through the narrow lens of logic. Whereas Gus, a human, could empathise with both of them - Jim, for the years of isolation he would have had to endure due to no fault of his, and Aurora, for her righteous anger at the one who decided her future without her consent.  The movie portrays in stark tones this messy business called humanity, all its strong points and imperfections. It doesn’t always make sense nor is it perfect despite the best intentions (Avalon's malfunction paints a ready picture). And perhaps, therein lies the answer - it's not meant to make sense nor be perfect, we are just to do our part, our share of good (hopefully not bad!) and move on.",19,5,Akinlabi Omo-Oso,7BWWWQzTpNU,0.056933719433719415,2019-04-09 18:43:44,False,False

Now begin walking and Stop after just 6 steps.....  Congratulations,You have now completed your journey. Yes that's how far they travelled from Earth to the other planet which took over a lifetime .So travelling 4 times around the earth per second (Remember SUPERMAN and LIGHT is twice as fast) It would take about  2,500 lifetimes to cross the Milky Way from end to end ...
