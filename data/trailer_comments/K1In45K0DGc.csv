Whereas THG and Divergent are about Dystopian future societies and focus on fighting against the political corruption with sci if elemnents.

TMR the reasons are completely unknown, it's straight up  mystery, sci fi and horror, I mean they are dark, violent and actually creeped me out many times to the point that I thought they could have been in the adult section of bookstores and libraries.

An apocalyptic event can be the reason for why it formed. But it's not about the event itself. Maze Runner doesn't have some totalitarian government who do terrible things to stay in power like Hunger Games or Battle Royale. And it's not about society that creates unethical life-styles of how you will live, that they believe is perfect but isn't like Divergent or The Giver. It's about how scientists try to deal with a disease that was originally created to control the population after a sun-flare attack and destroyed most of the earth.
