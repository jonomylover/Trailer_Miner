I'm not saying there are many things wrong in the original, but this movie really needs a remake.

We, the consumer, CAN hold Hollywood accountable for what it shows us and if we hold them to a higher standard they CAN deliver.  By sheer math, for now, they just don't have to. Making an average yawn-fest out of a recognized name is safer than making something that is fresh and creative because there are much fewer financial statistics and the market is less predictable.  This means they can intentionally put in a minimum of effort and make back the amount they want with very little risk.  Hold Hollywood accountable! Like the good things, shame the bad.",24,2,Fungorrr,pGemfKLV1JA,0.08147786458333334,2014-02-06 21:14:25,False,True

2015-05-02T03:41:45,"I liked the original Robocop...but there's a lot to like about the remake, you know.  Personally, I loved the inclusion of Robocop/Alex Murphy's family as major, plot-driving characters.  They weren't even _seen_ or heard from in the original, and it bugged me that Robocop's family never tried to check up on him...that I know of.  Then, the ED-209s.  They made _sense_ in the remake, being military androids deployed for military purposes outside the U.S.  They even had smaller, but equally threatening counterparts (ED-208s?  I forget.) filling up the ranks.  The original had the singular ED-209 proposed _as_ _a_ _freaking_ _police _droid._  (Though, that was possibly for comedic overexaggeration, since the original movie never had ED-209 do all that much for how big and threatening it was.  Considering ED-209's defeat the hands of a simple staircase...yeah, it was supposed to be silly.)  The acting in the remake was _phenomenal_ as well; I don't think there was a single bad performance in the film.  (Not to say the original was badly acted!  I'm not saying that!  It's just noteworthy that the remake was well-acted.)  And...well, if I gush anymore I might have purist fans trying to yell at me.  (To balance this opinion, I was not much of a fan of Disney's Maleficent, preferring the original, animated Sleeping Beauty.  That remake wasn't a bad movie; I just didn't like it as much.)  TL;DR, the 2014 Robocop is actually pretty good.
