Miles had gained his powers right before Peter died and he was even there to witness Peter's death. He then was on his own and tried his hardest to become the next spider man. He had a good solo. THEN SPIDER VERSE HAPPENED. Peter was more of a Jedi ghost to Miles, Through newspapers and internet pictures, not right there with him at the start of his career. Later in his life he DID meet Peter even before SPIDER-VERSE. It was a run where Miles even fought alongside Peter against the monster that killed Peter in the first place (Green Goblin). It's not annoying but weird to me that they couldn't kill off Peter for this movie.

I appreciate that they're going for a comic book look, but it's like they found some Ben-Day and halftone pattern plug-ins online and just slapped them on top of their existing animation and called it a day. Seriously, there are shots in here that look like they're supposed to be 3D and I'm not wearing the glasses. Some are just ridiculously blurry. No, not blurry. More just the same imagery on top of itself multiple times and then shifted slightly. What is actually good animation is buried under this garbage.  There there's whoever is voicing Peter. Jake Johnson according to Google? Sorry, but he sounds so flat and awful. You guys know this is an animated film right? I'm so fucking tired of hearing on camera actors, who can seemingly only act if they're on set, stumble awkwardly through a voice over role. Seriously, you couldn't have gotten Dan Gilvezan or Christopher Daniel Barnes or heck how about Neil Patrick Harris? You know, somebody who is older and has played Spider-Man before. Which is clearly what this version of him is supposed to be.  I'm also confused where this film is going. From the first teaser and the title, I thought this was going to be about the comic book event. But I guess they're just using the term ""Spider-verse"" because you got Peter, Miles, and Gwen in the same universe. But then why not just call it Ultimate Spider-Man? And what about the line about how ""in your universe there's only one Spider-Man...""?

And the animation style is gorgeous! Never seen anything like it. I can't even tell if it's 2D or 3D. It feels like a hybrid of both. And more than anything else I've seen this looks like a living breathing comic book on the big screen and that's really excited.

He understands and relays to Miles that the goal is to just protect innocent people, not save the entire world, just be the ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"". And in the end, he's wearing cargo pants, meaning he still loses pieces of his costume that he has to remake. 3: So glad Miles is finally on the big screen, and they nailed his character. He's a kid who gets embarrassed by his parents, but is sassy enough to still be confident as Spidey and question Peter's teaching methods. 4: Gwen Stacy isn't going to be just the girlfriend or smart nerdy girl, which is a major jump from her last cinematic appearance. Now we don't have to deal with the ""fridging"" problem. 5: I hope they really pull off the villains well, because it seems like there's gonna be a lot of them.

I don't like how they're portraying Peter Parker, I don't know what it is exactly, but something just feels off to me, I don't know if it's the voice actor, or the way he's teaching Miles, or what, but something is off.  2. I don't like them shoehorning in Spider-Gwen, this should've just been Miles's movie, the chance to bring him to a wider audience and have them get to know his character better and maybe even make him a better character in terms of not always being a copycat Peter Parker, now it seems (like classic Sony) they're trying to squeeze too much into one movie.  I hope these two points are dead wrong and it will turn out that Peter is the Peter we know and love and the inclusion of Spider-Gwen is natural and actually necessary to the plot of the movie, but given Sony's track record, and the fact that they needed Marvel's help to make good Spider-Man movies again...

For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  This means it's easy to get saved and gain eternal life. It's a matter of confession and belief. You must confess that God's Son, Jesus Christ, is Lord, and believe He died for your sins and God rose him from the dead.  Once you believe, all it takes is a simple prayer. Maybe something like this:  ""Lord Jesus, please save me, and give me eternal life. Amen.""  If you prayed that prayer sincerely, and you believe that God's Son Jesus died for your sins and that God rose him from the dead, you have eternal life... and you can never lose it! It's not about what we do, it's about what He did for us.  Ephesians 2:8-9: For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  John 5:24: Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  John 6:37: All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.   Now, once you believe, you become a child of God. You'll never see hell (even though our actions rightfully disqualify us from Heaven, once you believe, you accept the gift of eternal life and your sins are payed for, therefore you'll never go to hell). But, you can be an obedient or disobedient child. If you live a good life, you'll be blessed on the Earth, but if you live badly, God will chasten and punish you on the Earth. Even so, you will still go to Heaven.  Also, Jesus is the ONLY WAY to Heaven. If there were another way, He wouldn't have had to die for you and everyone.  John 14:6: Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Now, if you doubt the Bible, feel free to reply. The prophecies about Israel alone prove The Bible. If you want to hear about them, reply below and I will reply back.",1,2,Jesus Died For You,g4Hbz2jLxvQ,0.1297682709447415,2018-06-06 22:26:37,True,True

2018-06-07T00:49:46,"[Black] People are getting excited about Spider-Man being black. As a black person who's very  ""aware""  of certain things I'm not going to get my hopes up yet. Why? Well, because even though everyone knows that Spider-Man is a superhero - in this case (unlike previous movies) he's not really going to be the sole star/hero of the show. He'd be sharing the spotlight with experts in the field of ""Superheroism"" and whilst the initial impression is, hey black people we gave you a superhero - they (the experts) will be the true stars / heroes and (positive) center of attention. My concern - since proven right in the past - is that  he will portrayed as the typical black person who: is naive (novice) / has self-doubt / is academically-challenged / has is siting on his gifts and talents and, therefore, needs to be mentored by a non-black person that will be responsible for educating / refining / gentrifying / uplifting / empowering .. him because - of course - he (the black person) would not be able to accomplish those things on his own or from other members of his (black) community.  Based on the trailer... there seems to be a somewhat subliminal black-on-black opposition  and crab-in-the-bucket thing going n when the (black) father is the one who's against (black) Spider-Man (his son). My concern is that people's subconscious would be triggered to think that he's another annoying black man trying to hold back progress for the good of the people.    ...and, yes, the conspiracy theorist in me is not wondering if someone is pushing more black superheros because their aware that more black folks will be willing to spend their ""liquid"" finances on cosplay and Halloween costumes.  That's not to say that I'm fighting anyone's hustle... I just want to be sure that black people are not exploited, mocked and taken for fools in the process. That said - though I'm no expert I have a great appreciation for animated shows - and great appreciation I mean LOVE... I no longer have the love I used for T.V shows and movies because of the very same issues mentioned above (and then some) but this movies has a lot of potential.",0,0,Empress Niques,g4Hbz2jLxvQ,0.08103693181818182,2018-06-07 00:49:46,True,True

In the first trailer when they have Miles visiting Peter‚Äôs grave he‚Äôs wearing his standard black suit but when he‚Äôs training with Peter here he‚Äôs wearing a cheap Halloween type suit. At first I was thinking we were just going the ‚ÄúSpider-Men‚Äù route and we have a displaced Peter from another dimension but maybe this is this universe‚Äôs Peter and he actually dies midway through the movie.

But the second trailer shows Spider-Man in his 40‚Äôs, possibly, and alive. Which kind of is a bit of a spoiler and missed the chance to surprise us. Oh man Spider-Man‚Äôs dead?

(Washing of regeneration/HOLY SPIRIT/What it means on being BORN AGAIN):   ***The regenerative activity of the Holy Spirit is characterized elsewhere in scripture as cleansing and purifying.   ***(Ezekiel 36:25-27)<---Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.   ***(John 3:5)<---(Jesus)<---Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.   ***The Greek term for regeneration literally means ""being born again""---indicating a new birth effected by the Holy Spirit.   ***(John 3:6)<---(Jesus)<---That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.   ***(Romans 8:16)<---The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:   ***(Galatians 4:6)<---And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son (((into your hearts))), crying, Abba, Father.   ***Thus God saved us through one process with two aspects:   ***(1): The washing of regeneration  And   ***(2): The renenwing of the Holy Spirit.   But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man has not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. (Romans 8:9).   (Jesus): But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. (John 14:26).  Then opened he/Jesus their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures. (Luke 24:45).   (So, Jesus has to open your mind so you can understand and comprehend what the HOLY BIBLE is saying).   (Jesus): Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. (Revelation 3:20).   (Jesus): I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.   (John 8:24). JESUS=Son of God=God.  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.(John 3:3).   (Being born again is being born of the HOLY SPIRIT of God. And if you don't have the HOLY SPIRIT you will go to HELL and end up in the LAKE OF FIRE).   And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. (Acts  5:32).

So Miles is being tutored by Peter and maybe one by one more Spider Dudes show up? But there was that one clip where Peter is fighting a purple Spider guy (maybe) but then in one clip when they're training they meet Spider-Gwen. Also Peter seems to where his suit in public so maybe people know his identity. I saw Kingpin in there too. So maybe with the more Spider Guys showing up there might dimensional traveling or alternate villains show up too. I kinda hope I'm wrong so I'm more surprised bit also some details are true.

2018-06-07T21:15:29,Thing is in first trailer miles morales is standing in front of peter parkers grave so could that mean this old peter could have died after mentoring miles and he's the true heir after peter parker. This could also mean why miles is so desperately in search for the prowler and goes through any other villain trying to protect or have any info on him hence kingpin and green goblin. This is just my thoughts and off course i know in miles' universe peter is dead but i just thought the dialogue between miles and peter first meeting was a little odd like he's never heard of whos behind the mask before and what would happen if he relived peters death twice.

You ignored my advice and rejected the correction I offered. So I will laugh when you are in trouble! I will mock you when disaster overtakes you - when calamity overcomes you like a storm, when you are engulfed by trouble, and when anguish and distress overwhelm you. I will not answer when they cry for help. Even though they anxiously search for me, they will not find me. For they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the Lord. They rejected my advice and paid no attention when I corrected them. That is why they must eat the bitter fruit of living their own way. They must experience the full terror of the path they have chosen. For they are simpletons who turn away from me - to death. They are fools, and their own complacency will destroy them.

2018-06-08T05:42:09,"*Hey you!*          Hi, I'm TakeTheJurny, just a fellow small Youtuber with a big dream >_< I can't explain how much this means to me that you are giving me your time just to read this comment, and I know you probably are ready to go see a different video or maybe just look at your phone but, it really does mean a lot, because in our society time is very precious. So thanks for reading. Now that I've got your full attention. *M-MHM* I have worked very hard on my Youtube but I fear that the new rules and regulations and the terrible ""adpocalypse"" are going to be hard to surpass by taking the classic ""Make a viral video"" seems. So I have decided to comment here, on a viral video, and yes some may say this is advertising, and perhaps it is but please, hear me out. Right now there are 31,139 comments on this video. If every single person that commented on this video saw this comment and took a look at my channel and subscribed literally my dreams would come TRUE!!!! I mean, think about that for a second, we all, working together could make MY DREAMS COME TRUE! and I'm not even asking everyone to subscribe because I only want people who truly enjoy my work to sub, and I'm perfectly fine with that! I'm just trying to find the fastest and easiest way to give everyone a chance to see my work and enjoy it, as well as better my chances for growing as a Youtuber! Now let me rephrase my dream, just so you truly understand my goal...(also thanks so much for still reading!).   *FLASHBACK NARRATION SCENE OF ME AS A LITTLE KID*  I had a rough childhood. My father hurt me and my mom for 13 crappy years, crazy right? It finally shook my mom and she left, but I loved my dad still so much I stayed even though it totally sucked because he'd constantly hurt me, and I don't want to get too detailed because, well, kids might be reading-- anyways, that plus I was always outcasted from my classmates in school and I was pretty much stuck watching Netflix and eating to have fun at the time. It was always hard for me to see the bright side of things and I was losing hope as I sunk deep in to a sort of young depression. That is until I found something.. So I had never really watched Youtube at the time and I thought it was kind of boring tbh. But I was crying that day and looking for enjoyment. Then it was on the screen. ""Markiplier's Let's Play Slender The Arrival!"" I was so excited because I LOVED Slenderman so much, so with that in mind I clicked, not knowing what was to happen...but what would happen, would change my life forever. (Hey just another thumbs up for still reading!! I know it's a lot sorry!!).   As I watched Markiplier, as I listened to his positive glow and saw his bright booming smile as he squealed at different things about the game. I noticed something starting to change. I had stopped crying. I was also now smiling, focused and laughing at the video! Ever since then I kept watching his videos WHENEVER I was down, or sad or unhappy. His videos never failed to lift me up and cleanse me of my darkness. As he wandered down dark corners bravely, I wandered with him. Like a family. I wanted to share this feeling of happiness. This feeling of peace even in chaos! I wanted anyone like me to see this so that they would be happy too, so that we could all be positive and for once have some sort of universal truth of peace and a wonderful family. I want to do what he does. I want to make YOU smile when no one else is. YOU laugh on a bad day. and YOU can be my family when yours isn't there for you. (SORRY I'LL HURRY THIS UP! Dang you still reading? wow!)   So, my dream is to be what Markiplier was to me. A light in a person's darkness. I just want to make everyone laugh and bring everyone together. So that's why I made my Youtube. TakeTheJurny, because life is a Journey. Now I just want to say that this is not spam, this is a choice.

Disney's Tangled was supposed to have a look like this originally when it was still called ""Rapunzel Unbraided"", to make it look like a painting in motion, but they went for the generic CGI look instead.

2018-06-09T03:19:52,"Okay so here's my own personal theory with whats going on here especially with the two different Spiderman voices: The Peter we see in the diner with the burger looks much older than most incarnations, rather looking in his 20s he has graying hair it could be in his 40s+. We also see later on at the Gwen Stacy segment that he doesn't apparently have a full costume and neither does miles. Yet later we see Miles explaining the multiverse with ""Two Spidermen"" to who we assume is another Peter.  So I think whats going to happen is that there are 2 universes that will be delved upon (probably a LOT more with this Gwen Stacy reveal), Old Parker (with Miles) and Young Parker (no miles). In the old Parker universe he is near the end of his career, he has all the suits from the comics and the public knows who he is. Miles gets bitten and goes through his origin, EXCEPT Peter takes him on as a sidekick or protege. However in some sort of fight (possibly ending with miles being sent through to the Young Parker universe) Old Parker will die (thus the Peter Parker grave stone in the first trailer). Beforehand I think Old Parker may introduce Miles to the idea of a Multiverse (assuming that this Parker is a future 'Version' of the 616 one and has done interdimensional stuff before). For whatever reason, Miles will be sent to a universe where there is still a inexperienced spiderman. The one who asks ""How is this possible"".  Alternatively this could be the the other way around, Miles lives in the young Parker universe as a rookie but is sent to old Parker universe and learns.   Probably wrong but that's my take on things.",1,0,Emulator,g4Hbz2jLxvQ,0.10660919540229888,2018-06-09 03:19:52,True,True

2018-06-09T16:25:32,"Year 257,834 of no fap: My brain has grown to gargantuan size and is now about the size of a bowling ball. I am now able to see into the future where I will rule over all of humanity as a deity. My cognitive capacity has eclipsed that of Albert Einstein by one hundred million megafaggots.However, due to the fact that my brain is still growing, my muscle tissue is rapidly deteriorating as my muscle tissues are transforming into brain cells to support my immense intelligence and as a result, I will soon be reduced to a vegetative state where I will be able to warp space-time through my new knowledge of quantum physics.My knowledge of astrophysics has rocketed one million years ahead of anyone on the planet. Through this new knowledge, I unlocked the ability to warp gravity. With this new ability I was able to rip a hole in the space-time continuum to create wormholes that I have placed on the edge of the Kuiper Belt that lies beyond our solar system. In one of these wormholes I have discovered an alternate universe.In this universe I have discovered an earth in which homosexuals staged a coup d‚Äôetat against the international government and have taken over the world. I have studied the peoples for many years and have come to the conclusion that this is what our earth was meant to be. When I return to our earth, I will use my powers and research to create an advanced society of Chads that will become a level five galactic race that will rule over all other beings.You may be asking, what beings shall we rule? Do not fear, I have used my intuition to devise a perfect plan. First I will release a mega nut with the force of to big bangs. And then, with my understanding of the solar nebula theory, a solar system identical to ours will form through the colliding of planetesimal particles to form exoplanets that will resemble the planets in our solar system.I will then accelerate time by warping the time in the universe therefore speeding up the evolution process. I will then travel to the exoplanet version of earth and impregnate the first female with my ultimate hypernut that will travel with the max velocity of five Saturn V rockets.",2,0,I'm The Smartest Human Being,g4Hbz2jLxvQ,0.1909090909090909,2018-06-09 16:25:32,True,True

I don't really like this version so far, but the 90s Peter Parker beeing my alltime favorit hero of all time makes me obviously bias. As a mentor he might be pretty interesting.  Gwen could be great. I liked the Spider-Gwen character in the comics so there is potential.  The villans so far look stupid. I never liked the Ultimate Green Goblin monster and the Kingpin (if this even is him) is a little much too. Especially because it looks like his size doesn't even matter when he is thrown around just like anybody else is.. The kid in the cape.. don't recognise him. He looks cool so I'm optimistic.  Music, artstyle, animation.... everything looks really good.  conclusion: I am hyped and I hope Sony will do more awesome stuff like this with the license instead of chasing the big movie crowd.

Me and hubby always debate cuz he is a DC fan and I am more Marvel but I do admit DC was always winning in the animated movies and shows department. So hopefully Marvel step its games up and this actually gives me hope for that. Marvel animated shows that were good were the 80s Xmen and Spiderman.

2018-06-18T00:01:38,So is this just an excuse to cast a black person as a new spiderman. I am not racist in any sense but I do not recall this happening in the comics an older Spiderman teaching a new kid. I am not saying spiderman can not be a black person but when you start making films that purposley cast black actors or change male roles into female just to please years of biased in films. I would be more happy if they came up with their own unique identities for new characters for these people not use exicting ones but change race or gender.  It is just lazy hollywood knowing we know a series already so if we created a new world people would be disinterested.,0,2,Fender Mustango,g4Hbz2jLxvQ,0.13669507575757575,2018-06-18 00:01:38,True,True

2018-06-27T20:59:09,"It seems that Into the Spider-Verse will be introducing viewers to Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) as he grows into his role as Spider-Man, mentored by an older, more inveterate take on Peter Parker (voiced by Jake Johnson) than any we‚Äôve seen before.  Not only will Miles Morales ‚Äî the Afro-Latinx teen who became the first non-white iteration of the swinging superhero with Marvel‚Äôs Ultimate line of comics in 2011 ‚Äî be taking to the streets of New York in Into the Spider-Verse, but there‚Äôs also a glimpse of Spider-Gwen. She‚Äôs another popular take on the character in yet another universe where Gwen Stacy gets the radioactive spider-powers instead.    I‚Äôd be remiss in not pointing out that the art style of the film is absolutely gorgeous, with a textured, brightly colored vibe that looks like someone blended a comic book with Pixar-style 3D animation.   The new trailer also gives a bit more context about the setting of Into the Spider-Verse for fans who might not be as well-versed in the universe-hopping shenanigans of comic books. According to Morales‚Äô voiceover, the film takes place in ‚Äúanother universe, that looks and sounds like yours ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not.‚Äù (So don‚Äôt expect to see Tom Holland‚Äôs incarnation of the character swinging through the streets.)

2018-08-04T05:05:59,I have a little theory. The Peter Parker is from a different dimension. Why you may ask? Well Peter is suppose to be dead. Maybe the reason he can't pay for his food is because he left his wallet back in his dimension. Also when Miles sees Peter he looks like he's seen a ghost. Also one last thing at the end when Spidy mentioned comic con Miles is so baffled by it because it doesn't exist in his dimension.

If the director makes a mistake the entire team shouldn't have to suffer too. That's like if the quarterback of your favorite NFL team said something horrible, the rest of the team shouldn't have to suffer because of someone else's actions.

There's dumb and there's Marvel comics human dumb.   I mean let's say you do arrest or shoot him.

2018-12-06T21:27:36,This reminds me of the lego movie. Not anything with the story but with the way they animate it. In the lego movie they limited themselves to using only real lego pieces (with exceptions of clouds and the real humans) and in this movie you can see they use a weird dot effect(1:45) which was on comic books because it was cheaper to print it like that. Also there are BOOMs on the screen (0:00) like when a superhero punched someone it went pow.

2019-01-22T11:34:13,"My thoughts after seeing the movie are listed below:   Well, where do I start with this movie? Being an almost flawless origin story exploring Miles Morales struggles and his coming to terms with new founded super skills, it was set beautifully through the comic book animations. The film is the best film of 2018 and I really want to watch it a 5th time.    Well, I'm not really familiar with the comic books about Miles Morales, but I do consider myself an amateur Spider-Man fan, growing up watching Tobey Maguire defeat his opponents in the Sam Raimi trilogy. But this one was by far the best Spider-Man movie anyone could really ask for.     The humor is spectacularly displayed through the animation world of Spider-Verse, which to replicate in live action would be quite impossible. The input of thought bubbles was an amazing idea to see the progression and the thoughts from Miles. Seeing Miles Morales own clumsiness as he battles through what he calls puberty, and his old middle age Spider-Man mentor Peter B Parker's crusty experience and his self-doubt of being able to teach Morales adds to the humor. And adding onomatopoeia, including having bagel as onomatopoeia was also quite humorous.    This film well and truly explores the coming of age of a new Spider-Man who has more powers than the original. Focusing the spotlight on an Afro-Latino teenager, we are subjected to a soundtrack for the movie with a genre that is currently really popular even amongst young teenagers being hip-hop. The film doesn't fail to adequately describe how Miles Morales, a normal unexpecting teenager in the streets of Brooklyn, learns how to deal with superpowers that he had probably never wanted. But to really find himself, he goes through an emotional rollercoaster that triggers him finding himself.     My review would not be based much on the other characters but more on what this film was set to do; introduce Miles Morales. So in the film, for each different Spider-Men we see, we have a brief summary of their background, which allows for more character development. Except Miles' story is still being produced. The film's plot was almost flawless. The reason why I would say this is not because it was really much of a flaw, but something I would recommend on improving. Throughout the film, we can also see Miles' family problems, in being that Miles favors his uncle, Aaron Davis more than his own father, Jefferson Davis. We could see through the characters emotions that he has a special relationship with Aaron Davis, but the audience could not really sympathize with him much (well really me). SPOILER ALERT, when Aaron Davis was shot dead by Kingpin, we could see the hysteria caused by the non-diegetic sounds and the sadness dying in the arms of Miles. But personally, I couldn't really find that emotion. What I felt was that it was due to a lack of screen time for Aaron Davis. Its simple, we don't see him enough to miss him enough. A great example of this would be Wonder Woman. When Wonder Woman meets the pilot, she becomes acquainted with the pilot and the pilot shares a lot of screen time. When he dies at the end, both the audience and character feels the loss and empathize for the person dead. However, I felt that this was Spider Verse's most major flaw, and it is not even a flaw, just to show you how good this movie is.    What I did feel amazed by is how after the death and his failing to prove himself, he gets back up. Perhaps,  the thing that brought tears to my eyes was when Jefferson Davis gives Miles a mini-speech behind the door at the academy. The non-diegetic music adds to the sadness, and the father confessing to him about how much he pushed Miles because he sees a spark in him that is amazing really touches the heart. Obviously, this boost only sparks his powers, with which he finds out by taking a ""leap of faith"".     Being a spectacular Spider-Man film, which beautifully describes how a teenager finds himself, I would have to conclude by saying that Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse a solid movie.",34,2,KoreanJunkie365,g4Hbz2jLxvQ,0.25094619666048235,2019-01-22 11:34:13,False,True

2019-02-27T16:48:26,"Watched it yesterday, it's been a long time since I laughed and cried at the same time with a movie. The way it invigorates and reaffirms Spidey's cultural relevance  without abandoning its tone and sequential narrative is a work of deliberate art (the only one worth praising).  It gave me powerful Ninja Theory's DmC:  Devil May Cry vibes (the psychedelic palette, transitions between dimensions, the inverted falling scene, pretty obvious), along with anime film Paprika (a color explosion, almost literally). Truly amazing movie.   The only downside was, as usual, how Americans misinterpret anime style and conventions: (All good with a character like Peni Parker, but it really looks like a bad emulated anime style, and it shows A LOT as usual) They fail at character frames, proportions, eyes' size and expressions... and it seems they always will (Amerimanga SUCKS horribly), but Spider-Man's Noir conundrum with the Rubik Cube hypercompensated those shortcomings for me.  Great, great piece of work; let's hope nobody starts ripping off this style... I think Steve Ditko would've been proud.",0,0,Horus SC,g4Hbz2jLxvQ,0.07608695652173915,2019-02-27 16:48:26,False,True
