A white woman pretends to love a black man only to auction him off for a racism based brain transplant surgery. I wept watching the movie. I wept as I understood how cruel, uncaring and antipathetic the Caucasians are towards the non-whites. Then in November last year, I got to watch this movie. In the eyes of God, all humans are equal. Hence we get to see here how two individuals of different races face the same problems, suffer the same miseries and ultimately survive together. I was thrilled watching this one. In the end, the two fall in love. This goes to show that what GET OUT preached may not be completely true. Oh God! How wonderful your creations are. Some people who are obsessed with TITANIC and its cast are repeatedly bringing in references from that damned movie. Some are saying DiCaprio should have been cast instead of Elba. Some are saying both the man and woman should have been white, as interracial tales are uninteresting. If you ask me, I would not have given a fuck about this movie if it were not interracial.

2018-07-16T03:26:34,I wish the director would do more research for this movie. The film is to take place in Utah in the Uintah mountain range. I live at the base of this range. And there is no river that large as the film portrays. And no lumber mill any where near that size in the mountains. At best there are small sawmills but in small towns. You would stumble across a hay field first or a small community. It's only 20-30 miles to a town north or south. Never would it take 3 plus weeks to get out even in winter. It took me only 4 days to cross this range in summer mind you.

If the movie were to continue after they started dating, I'm sure the relationship would fall apart within a month.
