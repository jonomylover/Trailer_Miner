I'm pretty sure that this movie  will be a big hit for the last Captain America Trilogy before moving on to Marvel Cinematic Universe series. The Russo Brothers (who did The Winter Soldier last year) will make this movie great and I prefer the brothers side because when they did the second great Captain America sequel, it makes it perfect and this will be the finest. I was hoping to see Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) or Spider-Man (Tom Holland) in the sequel, but later on until they appeared in the next trailer which will be awesome. So anyways, the trailer is pretty cool and I can't wait to see it. No reaction to my thoughts, but this will be good. Don't think too much trailer people, believe yourself.

""This isn't freedom, this is fear"", ""I thought the punishment came after the crime"", etc..   Thus, If Cap has gone rogue, he has a good reason and is probably correct for it, even if it is against corrupt authority. I am totally on Caps side, but I have to say this trailer makes him look like the bad guy and iron man like the good guy.. 2vs1 beat down doesn't look good.

They show no story in the trailer about black panther or spiderman. I mostly care about spiderman. we know so little of spiderman. And this is such a big mess. They r all making stuff and just throwing it there. While there are new characters, cap is worried about bucky, falcon is worried about cap, they are all mixed up with different avengers, spiderman and black panther play in here, and cap still has to worry about cross bones! Nevermind Avengers infinity war! They gotta make the plot up to fit into infinity war. And in infinity war, there r so many dam characters! Not complaining about that but too many plot twists! there r ant man, doctor strange, vision spiderman, scarlet witch, black panther, falcon, war machine, hulk hawkeye, captain america, iron man, black widow, thor,wasp, AND the guardians of the galaxy! Plus villians. I love the movies but it's too much. But, I wouldn't have a problem if it all was like the comics! Where companies would share! There r no punisher, xmen, fantastic 4, ghost rider, blade. They don't even use daredevil.

2015-12-03T03:38:13,"Hokay... First of all, let me say, that was just a fantastic trailer, I can hardly wait, it really cant come out soon enuff! 8(   BUT I do have sum overall concerns...  As you may or may not have seen, the trailer reveals the basic(but not complete) character structures of the divided teams during the square off scenes. And while the Black Panther reveal wuz absolutely freakn killer, there wuz sadly absolutely zelch footage of  characters like The Vision, Spider-Man, or Ant Man. If you include The Scarlet Witch that's three very new characters(TV,SW,AM), two of those three (TV&SW)have had very little screen time. And on top of that you have the introduction of not one, but TWO of completely new and high profile Marvel characters which are The Black Panther and Spider-Man. Taking all that jazz into account and you end up compiling several more unknown dynamics into the structure of the overall storyline . So there's actually ALOT more actually going on than everyone going ballz crazy over the apprehension of The Winter Soldier because of his past actions who ironically and quite possibly could be taking up the Captain America mantle at the end if Steve Rodgers ends up biting the proverbial bullet, which is entirely possible given the original storyline. And I say ironically because while Bucky has been in two previous Marvel movies already, he has little actual screen time and even less dialogue time. Because of this I fear the strong brothers in arms bond that Steve & Bucky share which consequently is one of the main factors that kick starts this ""Civil War"" showdown(so very important lol), probably will not be as emotionally charged and consequently might not be conveyed to the audience as strongly as they had hoped for between the two. BUT I highly doubt it will be the same case concerning the similar yet different brothers in arms bond between Stark & Rodgers which of late seems strained with possible unresolved tensions and resentment. And because the audience is so much more familiar with the two being the current two largest marketed Marvel Studios  characters and all, making their square off felt and recieved on a much higher level. That scene towards the end where Rodgers and Stark confront each other and say (Cpt) ""I'm srry but he's my friend"", (Strk) ""So wuz I"" followed by Bucky & Cap teaming up to take down Iron Man wuz just down right chilling.(also wanted to note that it seemed Bucky handled Capt's shield with great precision and adpt skill, giving more credence to the theory that Bucky might be assuming the Capt. America mantle at sum point either at the end of Civil War or sometime in the near future...   SO! Basically, regarding the plot you have the Bucky being the primary catalyst for the for the Civil War, meanwhile you also have the introduction of Baron Zemos and he's up to to God knows what while all this sh*t is going down, but is probably the  deciding factor that inevitably ends up uniting the fractured Avengers under a common enemy or goal. That in itself is already a sh*t ton of different dynamics in the story, but compounding it even MORE so when you factor in some kind of decent or semi-reasonable/logical back story and motives for Spider-Man and especially The Black Panther, and the Wakandian(?) Kingdom. I mean that ALOT of story content. Which probably will lead to two things. 1) The run time of the move will most likely exceed 3 hours (which in my opinion isn't necessarily a bad thinglol). 2) Thats a Hell'va lodda characters and possible confrontations which means sum characters are most likely gettin killed off. It's theorized that just like in original Marvel Civil War comic story that Steve Rogers (Cpt America) will be killed. Also, in the trailer it certainly looks like Rhodey (War Machine) has either sustained critical and mortal damage during battle or has actually seemingly been killed from the way Tony is holding and mourning Rhodey. . Also, I really hope they finally kill off Hawkeye lol. Sorry, It's not that I dont particularly like his character, but unlike the comics its just that he's the least interesting hero character in the Marvel Cinema Universe. That funny yet annoying and devilishly witty charismatic bit that his character has always been known for in the Marvel Comic Universe. Which I always thought to be rather strange considering so far Marvel Studios has rather successfully been able to transfered or even amplify humor from the comic book pages to the big screen.",0,0,J SiN,xnv__ogkt0M,0.0973751125112511,2015-12-03 03:38:13,True,True

I think this scene is showing him holding back a bit and trying not to fight. I think this might be in the beginning or middle of the movie when he's hesitatent about actually fighting his friends. but as the movie progresses, especially after rhodes (war machine) gets as injured as he looks in the trailer, he becomes more violent and ready to fight. we'll have to see when the movie comes out.",0,0,Matthew Morrison,xnv__ogkt0M,0.05882352941176469,2015-12-03 23:58:32,True,True

Second of all she of all people knows what it's like to try to rescue a best friend from a Villain's mind control. (Hence why I liked how Hawkeye took Cap's side on the matter.)

We're seeing much of the Avengers because the new team that's in place is led by Captain America. Unlike in ""Winter Soldier,"" Captain America isn't part of S.H.I.E.L.D. after the old Avengers went their separate ways in the first movie. So if we're going to continue following Captain America, we're going to end up seeing the new Avengers as well. As for Iron man, who was part of the old Avengers team, the comic book focuses on his rivalry with Captain America, so that's why we're getting more of him too. Thor and Hulk are no longer part of the team, either. The actual ""Avengers 3 (Infinity War)"" is much bigger than this.

2016-02-05T04:10:05,"Here is my take on Bucky possibly yelling Steve's dead at 1:59.  If you look closely at that scene they're in the same covered area seen later in the trailer when both Steve and Bucky are double teaming Iron Man. When Bucky is moving his mouth, it looks like a one on one fight.  So maybe something happened to Steve mid-fight (dead or most likely seriously injured-Iron Man has a lot of fatal gadgets)?  Or is it before Steve shows up?  Maybe War Machine shows up to even the odds and him and Steve are fighting away from the camera?  It does look like Bucky has enough rage to pull out Tony's core, which would kill him.  That's some kind of symbolism for ""look at what you did to my best friend, I'm going to do the same to you!""  But that could be just his mouth moving seeing how he's in the middle of a fight, punched Iron Man, and trying to pull out his core with all his strength.  The guy is probably breathing heavy.  For what it's worth, in the comics Bucky does take over for Steve as Captain America while Steve goes into a temporary retirement.  He eventually comes back and Bucky goes back to being Winter Soldier (good guy).  In Captain America: Winter Soldier there were a couple of foreshadowing moments of Bucky holding the shield up and facing the camera when fighting with Steve (they even took a moment to zoom in and show it clearly).  He also does use it like Captain America would (using it as a shield and throwing it).",0,0,SINStrykerSF,xnv__ogkt0M,0.11333333333333336,2016-02-05 04:10:05,True,True

2016-02-25T02:23:01,hands down a must watch for 2016 and this is just a solo flick in phase three of MCU and being first film to be exact... I'm a fan of both DC and Marvel but DC all I have to say is that I have been disappointed with your movies so far except for Christopher Nolan's films and the Man of Steel movie... you guys have a mountain to climb and by throwing in the dawn of justice with like 7+ different characters with no back story whatsoever is just makes me cringe at this idea specially when you're throwing on top of that also a couple of villains and to top it off not include your already established flash that's just some true head scratchers... I want both BvS and CACW to both be successful films but DC I feel like you're just trying to catch up and that is not a plan for any success... you have two iconic characters which everybody around the world knows DC you better not fucked this up... but we will have to wait and see.

We care about these characters and having them face off against each other over morality issues is gonna yank on our heart strings. Warner Bros thinks its just because the heroes are facing each other and thats what fans wanna see so lets just have Batman and Superman fight and lets throw in a shit load of other heroes so we can get jump started on the Justice League movie because our spread sheets show that a lot of people turned out to see the Avengers movies. I would have rather gotten another solo Superman movie that expanded and fixed what we got in Man of Steel, instead we are getting this half ass movie.

And it actually involves an explosion during a fight between superheroes and super-villains in Stamford, Connecticut, that results in the death of hundreds of civilians. (This preceded the Sandy Hook shooting).  Tony Stark pushes for super hero registration to ease the public pain over the tragedy (much like our Democratic party with firearms registration).  Captain America is against registration because it jeopardizes the safety, identities and families of superheroes. (Much like the Republican party and the NRA wishes to abide by the American constitutional right to defend ourselves with firearms).  AND THIS MOVIE COMPLETELY SHITS ALL OVER THAT CONCEPT???

2016-05-07T05:02:37,This is a Movie Review so if you are scared of opinions then don't bother reading.  Also I am not the best typer.   The VIDEO REVIEW is on my channel so if you want to see it go check it out. :)   Civil War was a film that I've been looking forward to since the first Avengers came out in 2012. It has been a long wait and finally it has come. I thought the movie was above average but I also did notice a couple of issues with it. It has amazing action and spectacular characters. Iron Man and Cap both have great motivations to be fighting each other. The new characters such as Black Panther and Spider Man are some of the best characters in the movie but my personal favorite was Ant man. Paul Rudd shined in this movie as some of the best comic relief during some serious moments. My only problems were that the movie is too stuffed in the beginning but becomes more focused going to the second half. Also that the villian was pretty lame with just not really being intimidating nor important. Last but not least is that Marvel isn't really willing to take that many risks with their characters and I elaborate more on that in my video review if you want to see that. The video review does not have spoilers. 8/10 Great and above average but with some flaws.,0,0,Virtual Tyler,xnv__ogkt0M,0.2327551834130782,2016-05-07 05:02:37,False,True
