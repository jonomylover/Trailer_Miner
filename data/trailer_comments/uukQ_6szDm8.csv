2016-08-26T03:46:29,I think this has the potential to be good...hopefully the trailer didn't show all the jump scares and scary scenes. Thats what really sucks about horror movies. They need to put all the scares in the trailer JUST to get people to come see it and since everyone knows the scene when there will be a jump scare its not nearly as effective.   I know they film some scenes strictly for the trailer to save some mystery but not all movies do that and there's still a majority of ruined scares in the trailer. I am hoping that this one is different though because I adore anything to do with the Ring or Ringu. It's a really good way to freak people out and it's a super original horror concept. With all the modern movies its just about killers or ghosts and demons. Not a lot of originality. \: But the trend will move onto something else eventually like it always does.,0,0,Lenaya Carter,uukQ_6szDm8,0.056481481481481466,2016-08-26 03:46:29,True,True

2017-09-27T05:26:13,"Everything wrong with 'Rings' (SPOILERS) not that you should care...    First let me just say this movie is a perfect example of what happens in Hollywood where too many people have their hands on something and have slices of creative control. You end up with this mess of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be, does it wanna be a sequal? A reimagining? An origin story? A piece of shit?    They invent this 'tail' thing for the movie (where you make a copy of the tape and tell someone to watch it and it lifts your curse) anyway they do basically nothing with it, except at the start. I can think of a million interesting things they could have done with that through side stories or something.    They barely show an entire run through of the ring tape without cuts to character reactions, part of what made the original movies enjoyable was when you get to watch the tape in its infinite weirdness, as the character watches it, they don't seem to want to do that I'm this film, instead they want you to see how the characters face looks as it plays...    Just as big bang theory dude is dying in the car and the girl grabs his hand, it builds it up like his character is gonna have some important last words that will lead to something, but instead nothing comes from the scene.  Bar a final destination style electrical post falling onto the car? (am I watching ring or final destination, wtf)    All jump scares feel wrongly timed, and are also not scary at all (one jump scare is a little millipede crawling out of a fucking hole in a wall...)    There's no character development, after the introduction of characters, they don't continue to develop, the writers and the director basically say ""here's your little life, now you can't grow for the rest of the film"" not only that but, there's no comrodery between characters, not only can nobody in the movie act, but they can't seem to build relationships convincingly either. I feel like these people just met each other an hour ago...    The fact that the main girl has brail scarred into her hand, and just as the guy leaves a message to tell her it's brail.. She meets a blind guy, lmao, it's laughable.    I could list a million more things but I cba, this film is junk I won't waste no more time on it.

Maybe I am forgetting some things, but here is my list of what isn't in the movie (trying to keep it spoiler-free): 0:33 The house with one light on. This could be a quick transition shot, but I don't remember that. 0:36 Was anyone sending Julia emails telling her to watch the video? That isn't how it plays out in the movie at all, so I would think no. 0:47 The webcam with water coming out of it. I am pretty sure this didn't happen. 0:59 Julia never says ""That's when she is coming for me"" standing around the fire. 1:00 No one has a ring on their back. 1:36 The arms don't wrap around her like that. 1:41 And the HUGE one that really made people realize there was a ton of BS in this trailer, the fact that no one's hands ever fuse together like that. 1:43 No one is standing in the building when everything starts flying up into the air. 1:48 The ""mom"" scene doesn't happen. In fact, I don't think there is any reference to Julia's mom at all. 1:59 The blind man never said ""You've opened up a door, and now no one is safe"". Why did they do this?
