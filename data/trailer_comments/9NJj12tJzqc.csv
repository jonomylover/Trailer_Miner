And no, its NOT hate, its the truth.  Read it for yourself if you want to.....   THE OVERHAULING OF STRAIGHT AMERICA By Marshall Kirk and Erastes Pill  *A large-scale media campaign will be required in order to change the image of gays in America. And any campaign to accomplish this turnaround should do six things.  *Where we talk is important. The visual media, film and television, are plainly the most powerful image-makers in Western civilization. The average American household watches over seven hours of TV daily. Those hours open up a gateway into the private world of straights, through which a Trojan horse might be passed.   *In no time, a skillful and clever media campaign could have the gay community looking like the veritable fairy godmother to Western Civilization.  *At a later stage of the media campaign for gay rights-long after other gay ads have become commonplace-it will be time to get tough with remaining opponents. To be blunt, they must be vilified.   *Without access to TV, radio, and the mainstream press, there will be no campaign. This is a tricky problem, became many impresarios of the media simply refuse to accept what they call ""issue-advertising"" -- persuasive advertising can provoke  a storm of resentment from the public and from sponsors, which is bad for business.

It's not a choice and people don't just wake up one day and say ""I wanna like guys or girls or both"". I hate it when people always wanna use the word faggot because liking the same gender for guys has always been seen as weak or more feminine. So I'm really happy that they brought to attention with this movie. Hopefully a lot of people watch it. even people who hate gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. And to anyone making jokes and calling these people names for literally no reason that I can see, If you hate them that much then why are you in this comment section or looking at this trailer in the first place? Just think if the rules were switched and being straight was thought as bad or weak or stupid? You don't usually choose your sexual orientation. Your born that way.

This is a film trying to shed light on sexuality by bashing down the stereotypical barriers and at the same time trying to correctly convey a certain location and how those inhabitants are affected by it and those around them. I seen someone say something about all black people's morals being affected by Christian faith and I think that basically says that other races' outlook on homosexuality isn't and I think that's racist within itself, even if that's not the intention of the statement. In fact, most reasons why homophobia is rampant still to this day by all races is because it stems from religious beliefs. You think white people aren't raised to live by outdated ideas about masculinity? You don't any kid, regardless of race is safe from being subjected from bullying via homophobic actions? While I cannot speak for the black race myself for obvious reasons, I've had a few different black friends (a term I hate to use but makes sense for this argument) that say that they know more ""down low"" black men with gfs/wives/kids than they do of other races. That may be an outrageous statement to some, but in my area there is truth in it, even if it's not completely accurate. I know several gay or trans black men from either work or mutual friends, and IF the black community is harder on their homosexual men than other races, I truly feel sorry for those people. I work with a pair of black twins, one of which is gay. The heterosexual brother and other members of their family beat him down physically simply bc he came out. Maybe this film without relying on flamboyant stereotypical gay men, can really say something about those black men and that's quite alright. But to say others aren't pressured into keeping their secret to themselves without fear of persecution by loved ones is the silliest thing I've seen all day.

2016-11-16T20:23:07,"it wasn't that good and the handjob scene was so damn awkward... I really thought it would be good too. The movie is just too slow and instead of filling up the movie with a good story they spent a lot of time just trying to capture cool looking scene or just wasting time with long unnecessary scenes and stares. the movie just didn't have enough of a story. I felt like I barely knew who the characters were by the end. This directors had a GREAT idea in trying to show how a boy grows up in the black community and how most biys grow up in general, especially the loner types with a bad home life. But there needed to be more of a damn story! This movie had the chance to be the next Forest Gump, the characters were interesting and charismatic, the whole idea of the movie was showing how life is but IMO they ended up not telling any story worth watching. And the part that made no sense to me was that there was one scene where Chiron gets older and he checks out Teresas  breasts and she awkwardly notices. So that insinuates that hes just becoming attracted to girls, but then at the end of the movie Chiron insinuates that he never had a care for girls because Kevin was the only one that felt right for him. So is he straight, Gay, Bi but couldn't let go of his first ""love"" if you can even call hi that? The movie didn't do a good job in explaining his sexuality in fact all it did was make it seem as if Homosexuality is just a lust thing since all Chiron had to get was a handjob from Kevin to make him fall in love or something. Is it me or was this movie have major plot holes and just lacked more of a story?",9,7,Eddy,9NJj12tJzqc,0.19702380952380955,2016-11-16 20:23:07,False,True

2017-01-14T19:14:10,"This is truly one of the greatest films ever made. That's a bold statement but it's  deserving. It is perfection filmmaking by Barry Jenkins. The performances across the board where outstanding. Everyone's performance felt real and genuine. Mahershala Ali and Naomi Harris really steal the show in the supporting cast along with Janelle Monáe. And as for the six actors who played Chiron and Kevin, kid, teen, or adult, they all were perfect. The film also had an amazing script, jaw dropping cinematography, and a haunting score. The characters were rich and complex and felt like they were real people. The film is filled with realism and often is very hard to watch but at the same time it is so captivating and you can't take your eyes off the screen. Even the little details were perfect. The lighting, sound mixing, editing,  visual metaphors, and character details were so thought out and meaningful. The films plot is simple but effective. We've seen films where we watch the main character grow up in front of our eyes such as Boyhood but it's done with such class here that is gives off a completely fresh and new feel. The way the film is broken up into three chapters also gave it an interesting spin. The chapters are broken up nearly ten years apart so us the audience has to piece some things together in order to understand the development of the characters. The atmosphere also gives it this unique feeling. It's beautiful but very haunting and it really stays with you. Miami (where the film takes place) feels like a character. Not to mention the movie has not only a fantastic score but some of the best uses of music in any movie particularly during the third chapter which also has one of the best scenes in any film of the past decade. There are so many little nuances and things to talk about for hours after the viewing. On its surface it may not be relatable to many people but when you break it down it has something that anyone could grab onto. Whether you've had a tough time growing up, living in poverty, being homosexual, being bullied, not having a father figure, having a parent who is addicted to drugs, self discovery, becoming someone you're not, being different, covering yourself up, standing up for yourself, accepting forgiveness, or being a human being. This is a human story.  It's absolutely mesmerizing. Beautiful, brilliant, poetic, sad but uplifting. It is perfect in length and never gets boring. It doesn't drag and ends leaving you asking questions and wanting more. Needing to experience it again. It's subject matter is important but it never tries to beat you over the head with it. It leaves you speechless. It does something that true art should do and that is leave you having discussions. MOONLIGHT is a MASTERPIECE.

This is unlike ""Captain Fantastic"" and ""Fences"" when the whole cast did well. 2. This is obviously a shameful Oscar bait. African American poverty, drugs, homosexuality, coming-of-age, broken family. What more do you need to complete the stereotype? 3. Does it add anything new to the discussion on these issues? Nope. 4. Poor pacing. It used to be innovative for draggy and slow pacing to add the necessary shine to art-house films. But that was in the late 1990s. Get over it. 5.

What I saw was a young boy being bullied because he was small, dressed differently, and had more of a responsible attitude.  I saw a mother keep telling the boy how much she loved him but she wasn't willing to make the change needed to show him love.  I saw a boy discovering and experiencing sex.  I saw a boy sharing love (not sex) from another boy that was set in the same environment.  I saw one boy give in to the crime life that would most likely send him back to prison whereas the other boy realized his mistakes and focused on making a new life for himself.  The acting was good.

But for an independent film this made a splash. So props to the director. Although it's not the kind of movie you can watch twice in my opinion It's just wayyyyyy too many awkward silences in this movie. It has about a full hour worth of awkward silence time.

It feels like a documentary which I love. But this won't be for everyone. It's tough to watch this film more than once because you don't feel like you missed anything . One ,because it's not much talking at all going on. So it's an engaging movie until you seen at least once. Just my opinion , I hope I didn't give the film away still a must watch.

2017-02-26T07:17:12,"What happens when everyone is Chiron:  When Chiron was Little, he wanted to be himself, but only got hurt when he tried, so badly hurt he would forever carry the pain of these wounds. Chiron would cry so much that sometime he felt he might turn into a drop of water and roll out with the multitude of drops into the black depths of the ocean. One night when he went to the beach to cry some more, looking blue in the moonlight, he was touched by the only man who would ever touch him, and change the trajectory of his life. When that man hurt him even more, Chiron stopped crying. He became like all the other Rambo-fuckers and drowned his sorrow. Instead of being himself he became black and never tried to be anything else. Black reconnected with the only man who would ever touch him, who was also black, and together they caressed in the moonlight.  Moonlight: the light of the moon - have a second job in addition to one's regular employment  Black: of the very darkest color owing to the absence of or complete absorption of light - of any human group having dark coloured skin, especially of African or Australian Aboriginal ancestry  Chiron: is symbolized by the “wounded healer”. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.",0,0,S E,9NJj12tJzqc,-0.000287356321839067,2017-02-26 07:17:12,False,False

Every year the Oscars just feels like it's getting more and more politically correct in it's winners.  So winners are chosen not on the movie but on if some subject matter or group of people are in it and the SJW are behind it.  So even before movie was out it was going to be an Oscar winner by having a story of a gay black man battling poverty and gang violence.

2017-02-27T16:17:42,"I do want to understand even though I will not be watching.  Understanding is key for me.  I found comments in this review helpful:  To insist that stories about poor, oppressed or otherwise marginal groups of people are really about everyone can be a way of denying their specificity. The universe is far too granular and far too vast for any one of us to comprehend, and Mr. Jenkins is far too disciplined a filmmaker to turn his characters into symbols.  He does not generalize. He empathizes.    And perhaps the most beautiful thing about “Moonlight” is its open-endedness, its resistance to easy summary or categorization. I guess I’m back where I started, trying to decide what this movie is about. As with any original and challenging work, the answer may take a while to emerge, but what strikes me now is less the pain of Chiron’s circumstances than the sense that, in spite of everything, he is free. A bullied, neglected and all-but-silent child, he grows toward an understanding of himself and his world, and though it is agonizing to witness his progress, it is also thrilling. To be afforded a window into another consciousness is a gift that only art can give.

To be honest with you, La La Land was kind of overrated. Everyone was talking about them, saying how good they were, when really it was just mediocre acting. At least, in my opinion. Moonlight was hardly ever mentioned compared to La La Land, yet there was a hidden beauty about it. But everyone always goes for the typical, romantic shit. Sure the movie idea is original, but the concept is the same, just like with every musical. There's a guy, a girl, like to sing and dance, eventually falls in love. Typical. Moonlight highlighted struggles in two very different communities. The gay community and the black community. It is a struggle for gays in this day and age just as it is, but when it comes to black gays, it seems like there is extra criticism from everybody, especially the black community. We see gays as somewhat aliens. And a lot of black gay men go through struggles and hardships like the ones depicted in this movie. Emma Stone was right when she said this is ""the best movie ever"". It deserved all of the awards that it, and its actors received. So all you white people, and haters need to chill.

2017-03-01T20:32:44,So I finally watch this film and I really don't see what the big deal was. Spoilers Mahershala Ali was not through the whole film first of all. I'm baffled why he was nominated for the Oscar in the first place with this performance. He is a good actor yes but was this an oscar-worthy performance no. Same thing with Manchester by the sea. I don't understand why Casey Affleck got the Oscar his performance was average and he should not have beaten Denzel Washington. The storyline for Manchester by the sea was okay but I did not see an oscar-worthy performance by Casey Affleck. Anyway back to Moonlight I did not see the big deal about this movie I don't understand why it won best picture and I don't know why Mahershala Ali  got an Oscar for his very small performance that did not leave a big impact in this movie truthfully. The only oscar-worthy performance I did see in this movie was by the crack head mother.,1,0,mimi4sure,9NJj12tJzqc,0.18382352941176472,2017-03-01 20:32:44,False,False

It's not like I got lost-- I knew what was going on at every moment and the movie was predictable as shit-- it just hurt to watch. The camera was irritatingly jumpy, even in scenes without action, and I know _why_ they shot it like that; but I think the movie would've felt just as dramatic without the blatantly documentary-ish effects. In my opinion, this movie was no different or groundbreaking than ""Precious"" or ""Coach Carter"" or ""Training Day"", or any other successful film that focused on people of color. In fact, the only question I ended up asking myself wasn't, ""Why did it win best picture?"" Rather, I asked myself why it won _any_ awards at all. It's just a recycled trope and story that's been adapted a thousand times over. Every year a movie like this comes out and every year it wins a truck full of rewards, for no legitimate reason besides ""oh look, it's an all-black cast""! If I didn't know it was award winning, I would've thought it was an independent, b-movie film. The only interesting element was seeing Chiron's interaction with the kid and realising the endless cycle it created. But again, this has been done _to death_. Overall, I'd give this movie a 5/10.

It's just about growing up with forgiveness, love and pride - about different facades of character (for example, Chiron as hardcore drug dealer, but before the ending scene ___ (I don't wanna spoil you) etc)  And also it's very poetical - all the frames and effects and design contain meanings of their own and not just beautiful decorations.

I am a white male and cannot say what they go through what so ever but I grew up in the harshest neighborhood and wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. I can’t imagine what it’s even like as a black man but I have gotten my ass beat out of me by a bunch of black people in that neighborhood just because I am white and I will never stop fighting for equality because their color didn’t beat me. Their souls beat me just like the soul of a white man or Latino could have. Yes their anger because of what my color represents is what drive them to do so but it only fuels more anger and rage and the war amongst race and someday men of all ethnicity’s are going to have to say enough is enough.

This movie isn't good solely because the main character is a black gay man; this movie is good because of how it was structured compared to most Hollywood films. Like Quentin Tarantino, and Stanley Kubrick before him, Barry Jenkins offered an entirely different three-act structure that exploits the life of Chiron; with each act basically telling its own story.

How tough his life is ! It's like every road leads him to be social evils. Sorry for my bad English. I am not an native English speaker. I highly recommend this movie and it deserves the Oscar.

2020-04-19T00:44:56,"SPOILER ALERT - comment for already viewed -  This movie is indeed very poignant as it brings us into a world where almost everything is harsh and brutal for this quiet young boy being raised by his erratic and troubled mother.   When he begins to come of age, his mother has only gotten worse as has the cruelty and abuse of a bully who's been tormenting him since childhood. And right up through the love scene on the beach the story held together nicely. But then the characters and the storyline became disjointed and lost their heading, and, frankly, their believability. Right after the tender love scene where we see Chiron laugh for the first time, the next day at school the bully pegs Kevin to beat down Chiron. Not only the timing seems contrived, but that Kevin could be so cruel after establishing an emotional connection of so profound meaning with Chiron. It was thrilling to see Chiron become so enraged when he walked into class and smashed the bully with that chair and kicked him. Oh, how he deserved it! Everyone, the teacher, the school principal, knew the abuse Chiron had been subjected to. I just can't believe Chiron would be sent off to an adult prison, and I can't believe his transformation into a drug slanging thug. And then that Kevin would call him out of the blue ten years after that inexplicably cruel beat down as if nothing had happened... These elements deflated what the first half of the story had so carefully built. In spite of this I still give it thumbs up because the parts that were good were very good.  And I wouldn't want to discourage those who made this film. I think studio executives probably forced changes in the script that resulted in these problems.",0,0,robbes7rh,9NJj12tJzqc,-0.005162231559290396,2020-04-19 00:44:56,False,False

2020-05-14T17:44:50,"It was the balance between tenderness and care on one side and the harsh realities of an abused childhood on the other that might make you cry.   The world Chiron comes from is harsh and dark. Your mom’s more interested in buying and smoking ‘rocks’ than she is into degrading you, and she seems pretty into that. The walk home from school is more likely to end with a black eye than anything else. Be sure to watch for the pain in his face. It’s only a couple times you see him smile.   It was a chance encounter with an older man that provided Chiron with the first source of a calm presence in his life. It was Juan’s example of kindness to a young Chiron that you see glimpses of throughout the story.   The story for me, ends in an awkward place. It felt like there was more to unravel before ending.   It’s a story of pain, but it’s equally a story of the power of gentleness to mend a broken heart. It’s a story of how much those negative influences can bring a young man down and send him on a path leading to a life of pain, it’s also a story of being saved by the right influences. His life doesn’t turn out like a dream, but he’s here and moving forward thanks in part to the small kindness he received as a young man.",0,0,David Stys,9NJj12tJzqc,0.0674192665571976,2020-05-14 17:44:50,False,False
