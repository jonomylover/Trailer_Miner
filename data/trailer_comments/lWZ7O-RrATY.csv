That's what this movie is talking about when it says we need to change the future.   People are so overt and unapologetic these days about their malevolent behaviour, as if there's no future and it's their way of hastening the destruction of a world and order they know is evil, and that has abused them. If humanity is to have a future, I think people are going have to abandon this retreat into the reptilian brain that was led by neocons, neoliberals, and the religious right, and get back to the strategy that till recent decades has nurtured humanity, and gotten us this far. That is, to reside in the mammalian brain, the sole reason for existing which is to nurture, and in the prefrontal cortex, the sole reason for existing which is to control the reptilian brain.

2015-04-26T20:09:36,"I would like to see them make a film adaptation to ""Big Thunder Mountain"". With the right director and screenwriter, it could be the best live-action Disney movie based on a theme park attraction since the FIRST Pirates of the Caribbean movie (The only good one of the series). Something like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom/Raiders of the Lost Ark, Prometheus, Pirates of The Caribbean, Congo and to a certain extent The Missing rolled into one! Maybe the story/plot could be about a team of paranormal investigators and scientists embark on a expedition to investigate a Mountain in Utah called ""Big Thunder Mountain"" that is supposedly haunted and cursed based on a local legend. When they arrive at a the town of Tumbleweed, a small town near Big Thunder Mountain, they meet a mysterious and grizzled yet highly-skilled and wise frontiersman/gunslinger who forewarns them not to up into the mountain, but they ignore his warning. When they do arrive and enter into the mountain, they soon encounter great supernatural horrors and threats and find themselves trapped in the mountain but the same frontiersman they mocked and ignored comes to their rescue and now must trust and depend on him to escape the mountain which turns into a perilous and terrifying quest to not only make it out of the mountain alive but to also save the town of Tumbleweed as well as the rest of the world from a destructive and apocalyptic terror that awaits them as well as free the town of a curse that was brought onto them by the mountain nearly 200 years ago. The threats they encounter while trying to survive the mountain are a undead/zombie-like, and evil tribe of Native American warriors, demonic spirits/entities, inhuman creatures, natural disasters, a ghostly and sinister train, and even a band of evil treasure hunters/bandits seeking for lost Spanish gold buried deep within the mountains.

Twelve Years a Slave, Selma and Belle were good inspirational films but this is the perfect movie to motivate and speak to us all in these pessimistic times, encouraging us to optimistic and never give up; even if you're from the hood.This movie reminds us that if we have no investment, we see no potential, because it's been shut out and hung out to dry. These young people are not lazy. If they were lazy, they wouldn't have gone rioting in the streets, setting fires, tipping over vehicles, smashing windows or looting local businesses when in reality, they were screaming out for help. They don't want to be lazy. They have the potential, they have the drive, they have the passion, they want to show it, they want to express it. But at the end of the day, investment must be the foundation. Flowers and trees can't grow without roots, seeds, water and especially light. We need to shine a light on these communities again. If we invest more and provide more opportunities for these communities, then yes we dare to say that Ferguson, Baltimore, Southside Chicago, and Detroit can be Tomorrowland because we took the effort to be the dreams that we've dreamed of, be the wishes that we've wished for and be the hopes that we've hoped for.

2015-10-17T00:35:37,"This movie is simply amazing, but not in the way most people would think. Oh, it's a great movie and I enjoyed it a great deal. As I watch movies part of my mind is enjoying it. Another part of my mind, the subconscious, watches movies analytically. Let's just say it's a left -brain, right-brain sort of thing. The best way I can explain this movie (and many others) is their using very sophisticated social psychology. In short, they are using fiction to subjectively instill political fiction. In other words, mental conditioning. They use direct and indirect subjective stimulation to believe in all these left-wing claims of doom and social activism. They even state outright about Obesity. The little speech given at 1:40 minutes was sure a zinger. They were so bold that they attacked big corporations with Disney being one of the mega corporations. That shows their level of confidence that all the politically correct fiction won't affect them. And it won't because it's very big money pulling the strings of all the leftist politically correct movement factions.   After Walt Disney died, the Disney corporation gradually morphed into a massively politically correct propaganda machine. This became really obvious when Disney started implementing the so called gay rights. Walt Disney was one of America's greatest patriots. Not just politically, but socially in supporting the strong family bond and all the other American values. Now everything has changed and has become the exact opposite of what Walt Disney created. It has in fact become the biggest source of mentally conditioning our young. Who could possibly believe that something so innocent-looking could be so destructive. The bombardment of mentally conditioning our young is the cause of all those shootings. How perfect can you get to have such a benevolent-looking source of influence make so many people (mostly young) be so violent? The simplest way to explain it is extensive mental and even physical child abuse. We can see when it's most obvious like; 5 years olds being accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault; being handcuffed and even tasered by police. Some time back leftist teachers could even give their class ritoline. It's not like they're hiding it.  Their mental goal is to prevent people, especially children, from thinking for themselves and not to question. It's become Orwell's 1984, but with a lot more glitter. Shiny machines, lots of bells and whistles and all that color on screen that dazzle us.The leftists have diverted attention away from the book 1984 by doing the opposite of Orwell's gloom and abstinence. If you really want to save the world, you had better start thinking for yourself and question EVERYTHING! The world isn't coming to an end, we are seeing the building of a massive Golden Cage opposite of Orwell's filthy dungeon.
