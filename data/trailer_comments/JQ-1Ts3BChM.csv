Although not as good as the first one (for me) it was very nice to see the whole cast come back together for a nostalgic trip. You just have to sit down and watch it as a light hearted flick rather than the big blockbuster productions we've been getting. I will admit that there seemed to be a little more touchy feely scenes in here than the first one, which almost made it surpass the first for me (almost but not quite). Can still relate to the family too. It's not exactly Greek culture but more of an ethnic family culture in America. We're all guilty of it. Irish families, German, Italian, and for me my polish family. We're just proud of our heritage :). Overall I would say yes give this movie a go and don't overanalyze it.
