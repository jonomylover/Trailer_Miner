The only main overweight person was the villain not sure if that was a low blow at body shaming the obese or if I am over analyzing.  However every cop, pedestrian, driver, business man, fire fighter and park goer were all white.  They didn't even try when in their 'China Town' area to add some people of different skin tones.  For a city that gets hurricanes therefore near an ocean ontop of being a metropolis in size there is not one single tan, brown or black person to be seen.  I'm not sure how much it costs to add a few more skin tones to an animated film but I am sure hardly any time and money is required to diversify a city.",0,0,Bobby fakerton,e5qIZ89hj_A,-0.02269345238095238,2017-08-31 01:26:45,False,True
