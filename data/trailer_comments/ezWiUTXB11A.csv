2016-04-16T04:31:23,"Nat Turner was a murderer who led other murderers. His group even murdered handfuls of young children. In total, using knives, axes, hatchets, sabers, and various blunt objects they brutally and mercilessly slaughtered around 50 to 65 people in about 36 hours. As a result of his 1831 killing spree, not only did Turner hand slavers the dubious excuse to kill innocent blacks that weren't even involved in his murders,  but Turner also did more to tighten the chains of bondage than any man in American history including marking the beginning of the end for the Southern anti-slave movement. This movie will most likely not present truth or real history, but propaganda and false vindication for those that are obsessed with the hue of their skin and use their color to both horde over others and to gain unmerited advancement at the expense of their fellow citizens.  This is the second motion picture titled ""The Birth of a Nation.""

2016-04-16T10:20:45,"This looks like an incredibly, well-directed film that hits hard emotionally, but there are definitely concerns about the timing and message this film is sending.  Last year I took a history course at university, and we were discussing the story of Nat Turner.  We read excerpts about the events that unfolded as he plotted revenge against the slaveowners for the injustices of slavery.  But there was a discussion that still gets to me every day:  My teacher celebrated the death of every white person killed by Nat Turner and his followers.  This went beyond slaveowners, but to children as well.  While I understand the terrible treatment slaves went through as they were torn from their homes and brought to America, I don't believe the children of slaveowners ""deserved"" to die.  It's not as though they chose to be slaveowners, but were rather born into it, being taught to accept and believe the immoral teachings of their parents (most likely just the father considering the time).  When I voiced my point of view to my teacher, I was quickly dismissed and labeled as ignorant by the rest of my peers.  The way I saw it, the children were victims of their own family's wrongdoings.  The way my class saw it (or most of them, at least), was that if they were white and associated with these slaveowners, the children deserved to be killed.    Long story short, I believe people need to think critically about who or what is to blame, and what is actually ""right or wrong,"" if there even is a clear answer.  No one ever tries to understand situations from multiple points of view.  Social media is quick to make us decide what is right and wrong, who is good and who is evil.    Just look at the election.  Obviously, liberals hate Trump.  He's the worst possible figure in their eyes.  Social media is quick to label Trump and his supporters as ignorant, uneducated racists.    Do I agree with their arguments?  No.  Do I understand them, at least to a certain extent?  Yes, at least more than most of my liberal peers.  Trump supporters are frustrated.  They're frustrated w/ how politically correct our nation is becoming.  For one, they don't see a movement like ""Black Lives Matter"" as being one for equality, but one for a complete shift in power.  Many will disagree with me, but I absolutely see this point with the way Social Media portrays it.  Another example includes immigration.  They are frustrated with the topic of illegal immigration turning into the topic of ""immigrants are people too.""  -Yes, immigrants are people, my grandparents included.  But they came here legally.  It's not an argument of whether or not you're human beings.  Of course you are!  The argument is about uncontrolled and illegal immigration into the U.S.!  The approaches that liberal movements have been taking are just trying to guilt everyone into taking their side.  They are literally ""silencing"" the opposition.  In Black Lives Matter, there was literally a trend going around saying ""if you stay silent, you are part of the problem.""   I realize I'm digressing, but as you can obviously tell, I am frustrated.  I'm a liberal who believes in the foundation of being a liberal, but disagrees with the strategies and courses of action we've taken.  And with that, I'm going to stop my 3am rant and go to bed before I write an essay.  Just be human and think logically guys.  Understand before choosing a side.  One of the most ironic terms is the term ""liberal.""  It had great intentions, but now people who join automatically believe they are open-minded.  The process starts the other way around.",2,0,Niko Santiago,ezWiUTXB11A,-0.014548319327731082,2016-04-16 10:20:45,True,True

that all these curses shall come upon  thee, and overtake thee:16 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.17 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.18 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.19 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.20 The  LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that  thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and  until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings,  whereby thou hast forsaken me.21 The  LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed  thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it.22 The  LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an  inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with  blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou  perish.23 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron.24 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.25 The  LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go  out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be  removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.26 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.27 The  LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and  with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed.28 The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:29 And  thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou  shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and  spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.30 Thou  shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt  build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a  vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.31 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.32 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long: and there shall be no might in thine hand.33 The  fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou  knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:34 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.35 The  LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch  that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy  head.36 The  LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee,  unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there  shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.37 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.38 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.39 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.40 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit.41 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.42 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.43 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low.44 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.45 Moreover  all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and  overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto  the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his  statutes which he commanded thee:46 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.47 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;48 Therefore  shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee,  in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.49 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;50 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:51 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.52 And  he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls  come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he  shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the  LORD thy God hath given thee.53 And  thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and  of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege,  and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:54 So that the man that is  tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his  brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his  children which he shall leave:55 So  that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom  he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the  straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy  gates.56 The  tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set  the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness,  her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her  son, and toward her daughter,57 And  toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward  her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of  all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.58 If  thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written  in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE  LORD THY GOD;59 Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.62 And  ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven  for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy  God.63 And it shall come to pass, that  as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so  the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to  nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to  possess it.64 And  the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the  earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which  neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.65 And  among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of  thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling  heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:66 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:67 In  the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou  shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart  wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou  shalt see.68 And  the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way  whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye  shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man  shall buy you.",0,0,Yarad Yisrayl,ezWiUTXB11A,-0.0870986394557823,2016-04-16 12:41:17,True,True

African Americans have been far more rebellious attacking thousands of white people in those rioting 'protests' over the country last couple of years then they ever where while in slavery, which is really more interesting then one small rebellion of not even a hundred people (out of millions of slaves) during slavery which murdered innocent law abiding US citizens, families, woman and children. I really cant believe they are promoting more racial tension and violence with this movie, its immoral and wrong, we should be coming together as a country to prepare for the coming fight against Russia, China and Islamic terrorist, not gearing up to kill each other over the color of our skin. Also the title is very unoriginal and doesn't make since because the Nat Turner rebellion happened around 30 years before the Civil War, and there wasn't any real rebellions after that, not even during the War of Northern Aggression. So the events of this movie doesn't take place around the Revolutionary War or the during the War Between the States, so I mean how did Nat Turners Rebellion birth a nation? Also a little fun fact, only around 1% of whites owned slaves in America, where as 28% of free African Americans owned slaves in America, so there was a decent amount of black slave owners in this country and white people alone shouldn't have to carry that burden. In fact, the federal government monopolized that slave trade by making it a law that all slaves coming into America had to be sold in Washington DC first before being sent out across the country, in that way they got to tax the sale and make mad money. Americans where encouraged  to by slaves by the US government in order that farmers could produces more natural resources and the country could stimulate finical growth quicker. Whites, Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans all owned slave, but the US Government was the slave dealer and they hold the true responsibility for Americans early addiction to slavery, I mean do you punish the heroin addict or heroin dealer?

2016-04-16T14:18:52,"It will be interesting, to say the least, to see how Hollywood frames the story of Nat Turner; to see how they will frame the rebellion in which half of the slaughtered victims were children and infants. If Hollywood's past films are any prediction of the nature of future films, then this will turn out to be a lopsided presentation — beyond the most obvious reason. There is nothing wrong with portraying the horrors of the American institution of slavery. On many plantations, blacks were treated worse than livestock. They were starved, beaten, raped, and abused in numerous ways. All of that deserves to be remembered. The problem, however, with relying on Hollywood to be the keeper of America's conscience is that most if not all of its black historical films are intended to serve as finger-wagging for today's headlines (e.g., incidents involving the police, the Black Lives Matter movement, etc.). In other words, we are being told that the systemic problems of 1831 are alive and well in the 21st century.  This is problematic because it glosses over thousands of significant details in the intervening years, from Reconstruction to affirmative action. Within that time-skip, black Americans jostled not only with whites but with themselves, struggling to select leaders whom they believed would best protect their interests. Too often we hear about Malcolm X and absolutely nothing about Booker T. Washington; too much about the brutal actions of Nat Turner and too little about the pulsating, sober intellect of Frederick Douglass.   Not all black Americans thought (or think) alike; yet that is not the image with which we are presented by Hollywood. In neglecting black historical figures whose philosophical ideas differ from today's mainstream progressive-liberalism, Hollywood reveals itself to be no less manipulative than many of the white plantation masters who took it upon themselves to determine what it meant to be black in America. If we had more Hollywood films about Booker T. Washington — replete with national advertising — we might, at the very least, be compelled to divide our attention between the historical abuses inflicted on black children in the 1830s by white masters and the daily slaughter of black children by black gangsters in today's most ""progressive"" and ""liberal"" cities; and in so doing, we might then be compelled to ask ourselves where and with whom the responsibility for that tragedy truly lies.",0,0,Donut Baker,ezWiUTXB11A,0.033280141843971635,2016-04-16 14:18:52,True,True

Yet liberals  blinded by a 'righteous' sense of social justice and equity will ignore Turner's actions (the first victim of his uprising was an elderly women who he personally caved in her skull with a fence post, and soon after slit the throats of infants in their cribs) and decree him a hero, thus the hypocrisy of Liberalism, to glorify their sides deeds (no matter the implications, history, or transgressions) and crucify their opponents for even the slightest 'fouls', is abundantly clear.

2016-04-18T00:05:34,"LIFE AND DEATH ARE BEFORE YOU!   Sin equals the death of the soul which is hell   Ezekiel 18:20 THE SOUL THAT SINNETH, IT SHALL DIED. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.   Ecclesiastes 7:20 For THERE IS NOT A JUST MAN upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.  Where do the spiritual dead go?  Revelation 20:14-15 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. THIS IS THE SECOND DEATH.  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.   HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS! Jesus who is the very Word of God, the very Son of God, took on flesh and became a man to save us from our sins!   John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.    John 1:14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.   Luke 1:35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.  He lived a perfect life of righteousness and purity. He is called The Lamb without spot or blemish, because he did not sin. He healed the sick, cast out devils, performed miracles, and taught men the way of righteousness. He was betrayed by a pupil and friend, who is called Judas. Turned over to the authorities, he was examined, beaten, and whipped. They spat on him, struck his face, plucked out his beard, and eventually crucified him, nailing his hands and feet to a wooden cross.   1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:   1 Peter 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:   He took the punishment for every sin ever committed by every person that ever existed as if he had done it.  It does not end there.  He died and was buried. He spent 3 days and 3 nights in hell.    Matthew 12:40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE HEART OF THE EARTH.   He was burning exactly as one who enters the damnation of hell.   His soul was not left in hell.  He rose BODILY from the dead and showed himself to his disciples (his close friends and students).   Acts 3:13-15 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let [him] go.  But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; And KILLED THE PRINCE OF LIFE, WHOM GOD HATH RAISED FROM THE DEAD; whereof we are witnesses.    He ascended into heaven where he is now at the right hand of God the Father.  Jesus is with God and is God.   Listen to what he says.   John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.   If you believe this you will have eternal life.   John 3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath EVERLASTING LIFE: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.   John 11:26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me SHALL NEVER DIE. Believest thou this?   If you believe, you will have life that lasts forever and you can not lose it no matter what you do or how bad you are?   Ephesians 4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby YE ARE SEALED unto the day of redemption.   1 Peter 1:5 4-5 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,  Who are KEPT by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.   It is the SHED BLOOD of the LORD Jesus Christ that cleans us.   Hebrews 9:22  And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.    Colossians 1:20  And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.   Surely this comes at a heavy cost to us? Must we do works of kindness to qualify or earn this salvation? It is 100 percent free!    Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the GIFT OF GOD: NOT OF WORKS, lest any man should boast.  Ephesians 3:7 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the GIFT OF GRACE of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.   IF YOU BELIEVE THIS, All you need to do is call on the LORD! Simply pray, ""LORD I am a sinner, I believe that you sent your son to save my soul, I accept him and only him as payment for my sin, Jesus save me!"" Say this and you will never go to hell and heaven will await you upon leaving the earth.",1,0,Leopard-King,ezWiUTXB11A,0.133469387755102,2016-04-18 00:05:34,True,True

How about one showing how blacks were sold by other blacks into slavery in America? I guess Hollywood would rather continue to show only part of history so we can continue to blame only white people for slavery when North America only accounted for 6% of the slaves sent to the Americas. During the Atlantic slave trade Brazil had more African  slaves than any other country. I urge people to do some research of their own and look this stuff up. Enough with blaming just white people for black slavery. Yes only about 2% of whites in America actually owned slaves. I will admit that some white people were a part of slavery in that time, but so were the blacks, middle-easterners, hispanics, etc. Yet despite all of this the ONLY movies dealing with black slavery I see are white people and their black slaves. This a movie about a man who got a group of about 70 black slaves together and went from house to house murdering over 50 white people indiscriminately.

Yes, it might be a mixed of facts and fiction in order to dramatize the movie, after all, movie studios still have to make money. But if it gets people interested in history and to research what happened and read and talk and even open up dialogues between different groups (without the insults) of why people feel the way they do or even how history came to be written by our forefathers (the events that transpired), I think this movie shouldn't be negatively shot down (nor praised as I have not seen it yet). History is rarely ever clean, simple or easy to read about. It's just what it is, it can be more times hard, brutal and bloody and it has always been this way and even though it's hard to think things like this could have happened and it will make people cringe in horror at the fact of how history can be brutal and even barbaric and savage, history can still be a powerful tool for positive change and progress, as long as we don't forget where we came from and we don't try to sweep it under the carpet so that people feelings aren't hurt nor rewrite history books to appease anyone for fear of insulting anyone's fragile emotion (defense mechanism most use: forget the past, live in the present) . We should never be afraid, or shy way from facing the truth that through time different groups of people have suffered pain (And yes there were good and bad people, just like there were good and bad white, black, Asians, and so many other people). History also has a lot of great stories of human accomplishments and stories of perseverance, sacrifices, and challenges that had to be faced before success and freedom could be attained by groups all over the world. And if you don't want to see the movie, then pick up a history book, a biography, talk with historians, professors, and research facts on your own and educate yourself about what truly happened and even watch documentaries. There has to be a bridge to connect the new generation so that they can become independent thinkers and remember the many pebbles that it took to build the road they walk on today... And even though it's not a smooth road and there are many bumps, it's the road that they can still improve on by learning and educating themselves on the truth that exists and every journey starts by asking questions that will lead them to a new and sometimes scary adventure through time. Don't let the fear stop you from finding out the truth and accepting that what we take for granted today was hard earned and fought for by the many people who sacrificed and died themselves.

In the 1700's and 1800's 95% of the people in American South were tradesmen and sharecroppers and didn't own much except a small house and maybe a small farm.  It was the very small amount of elites who the the film industry portrays as evil.(in which they may had been)  You had hardworking Southerns who believed in human rights and just wanted to make a modest living.  Both Confederate and Union soldiers were fighting for their homes and many were fighting because they were forced to fight or wanted to succeed to just avoid unfair trade tactics and taxes.  When are we going to see a historic movie that shows Ga, SC, NC and Va getting burned to the ground as troops set homes on fires and killed innocent people of all backgrounds and all ethic groups. The history books leave this out but his really happened as well. Peace and United today we all stand as one nation for we all should be treated equal.  Those who don't know history are bound to repeat it.   BTW my family is originally from Southhampton Va and they never owned any slaves and to this day they would help anyone in need.   Too much Spanish Moss on those trees at the house, or as they say in southern Va ""hoose""    Spanish moss is only found in small pockets deep in the Dismal Swamp and at First Landing State Park in Va Beach in the state of Va.

Some of my innocent relatives in the 1800's were murdered by Nat Turner who had nothing to do with slavery.  Will this movie show this: The rebellion began when Turner’s small band of hatchet-wielding slaves killed his master, Joseph Travis, along with his wife, nine-year-old son and a hired hand as they slept in their beds. Realizing they had left one family member alive in the house, two slaves returned to the Travis home and killed “a little infant sleeping in a cradle” before dumping its body in the fireplace. As they swept through the countryside, Turner’s men freed slaves as they continued the killings. Upwards of 75 of them joined the uprising over the ensuing two days and killed dozens of whites. source: History Channel         Killing babies and innocent white sharecroppers???
