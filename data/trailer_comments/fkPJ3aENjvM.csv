2016-09-30T21:10:01,all these super hero names are incorrect. the movies true inspiration. is those we shun those who are the  wallflowers' are actually more capable and smart then we ever give them credit for. they could be anywhere. they are good people who follow a code that is more perceptive and more pure then anyone else can understand. those like him who are socially awkward and smart as hell. those are the kinds of friends you want. and they could be anywhere. they could be here there. or even right next to you. i could be one you could be one anyone could be one. the internet is like wearing masks. anyone of us. might be these socially awkward people that moved against the tide and wanted their morals to be understood. morals that our corrupt would can not understand as it slowly degrades our minds that follow the flow of whats 'acceptable'  the character the accountant factually could be medically diagnosed with Asperger or any number of similar 'disabilities'. this is what the rare few of them can become in theory as capable. not danger. but this is the progress they can make by measurement. and these are the observations they can make. the willpower and strength of mind that they have. so next time you see someone using that autistic meme insult feel free to laugh at just how wrong they are. this is the extent of the kind of progress effort and capability. they truly have. they win by thinking as 80% of their time. not by fighting or speak. they could plant a small metaphorical seed of info and it could be stronger then any armed occupation could have over people. and all they had to do was consider what you desired to hear and what you wanted to know. they mold their actions and how they react by observing what another does and then react with a matching reply to the situation from such.  this is all realistic. this is what this movie means. this is proof the 'smaller of us' are the more influential.,0,0,Aidan Ryuki,fkPJ3aENjvM,0.12142857142857141,2016-09-30 21:10:01,True,True

Kendrick has yet to show her teeth in full I believe (she has talent that's for sure) so lets see here. Fingers crossed she can show us a little at least.
