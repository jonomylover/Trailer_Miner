So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. If you want to get more out of life, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty.‚Äù",2,1,ryan bonner,QlSAiI3xMh4,0.24425990675990678,2016-04-27 21:10:09,True,True

2016-04-28T00:52:43,"FINALLY someone made a big(ger) budget movie with at least recognizable actors and enough mindless Hollywood window dressings to potentially capture the attention of an otherwise rather willfully ignorant American populace. I wrote a book inspired by this nightmare this awhile back because you can't imagine a scarier enemy than one who is omniscient and omnipotent; and omniscience and omnipotence is certainly the end game of the New World Order George HW Bush talked about on September 11, 1991. His full speech is here on Youtube, if you're curious.  If you want a more realistic portrayal of the truth, and a very horrifying movie experience, watch CitizenFour, available on iTunes, it is excellent and probably less biased than any film by Oliver Stone, although I greatly applaud what he's doing. Trying to get people to comprehend the massive behemoth they're funding with their own tax dollars as their cities rot and their educated get crippled by massive loan debt is an uphill battle, and most simply can't handle factual documentaries.   Most people also do not connect the dots between the things Snowden warned of, the never-ending war on terror that grants perpetual wartime powers to the government, and the FBI's current battle to cripple encryption. You would think people would care, given that they're paying for all of it, and that even if they trust a group of faceless ""protectors"" (or just bored pervs) with access to their every digital conversation, and real life conversation within range of an internet connected microphone (every phone and laptop these days), there may come a day when these people are replaced by new people who are not as trustworthy. This is why you never grant absolute, unquestioned powers to a governing body. Would you trust a drone capable of killing you hovering outside your house, controlled by a police officer who could see inside your home, internet connection, and hear your every conversation every second of every day? It's not there today, but anyone with an imagination and even the most casual awareness of what's happening on the news can see how the police force will be evolving from body cams in the future.   One must also consider the fact that the American government's sloppy war on terror is at least partially to blame for some of the problems we now face in the form of ISIS. Before you tear my head off, do a little unbiased research. I fully support American troops, and find them incredibly brave. I also love America enough to get angry when I see its Constitution getting shredded before my eyes. One can support America without supporting a rushed, sloppy war on terror or the government who used the fear associated with 9/11 to start it. There are also some sources claiming people within our government past and present FUND terrorists simply to get rich and maintain power...which is pretty much the job description of any career politician who does not believe in limited government and the separation of government from the free market, is it not? Google ""libertarianism"" if you don't understand what I mean by ""limited government"".   Did you know the F-35 military program yielded next to no benefit to everyday Americans and yet could have funded all of their college educations for 20 years according to Mike Gilmore, a Pentagon weapons tester? Think about that the next time you consider college tuition cost. We're funding people to play with war toys and spy toys and are okay with it at the cost of our economy, world standing, education, and childrens' futures.   The debate over Snowden is simply a debate over the need for checks and balances in all branches of power and an informed populace who can influence their government without merely submitting ignorantly to whatever the government chooses to do, now and in the future; shadow governments with never-ending wartime powers are under no one's control but their own whims. And if you trust humankind enough to grant a group of humans absolute power, then I would suggest you are massively ignorant of both human nature, and all of human history. But most people cannot even begin to desire to imagine such a horrific worldview, lest their brains explode. Major motion pictures watered down with Hollywood drama and just enough sprinkling of facts like this, even if a bit cheesy compared to much richer documentaries on the subject, are certainly a step in the right direction, so I don't understand the hatred in the comments about this being a glossy Hollywood movie.   If only they would make a movie stating the obvious, that two planes do not cause three buildings to implode (google ""World Trade Center 7"" if you don't recall the building that mysteriously imploded across the street, even when towers 5 and 6 stood after being pummeled by exponentially more debris), nor would a plane be able to fly fast enough or low enough to vaporize against the Pentagon; maybe then people would really wake up and question the role of their current ruling class. Dynasties are not the answer. Trump is not the answer. Socialism is not the answer. What America was founded upon is the answer, and what the war on terror is really a war against the founding principles of America. America government was designed to have checks and balances. The public was meant to be informed, and elect those who represented them, not billionaires or dictators. Perhaps the general public should educate themselves with the ideas behind the Constitution.

Shame on Oliver Stone for putting his name on this filth and honoring this traitor as a hero.¬†What he did was denounced by President Obama, and President Obama is a kind and well intentioned man. The only people who'll like this piece of trash movie are conspiracy nutters who think that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax and that reptilian shape shifting lizards were behind 9/11. And shame on those of you calling him a patriot. There's nothing patriotic about releasing your own country's intelligence information which can now be looked at by other countries. There's nothing heroic about ""exposing"" the hero's trying to fight terrorists or fleeing to Russia. The true patriots are those who have given an arm and a leg to protect your rights. The true hero's are the firefighters, cops, and city residents who helped save people from the twin tower rubble, and Hillary Clinton who as a Senator helped rebuild New York City and unite New York city after the tragedy. You people have really pathetic definitions of hero and patriot. I guess that's what happens when you watch too many youtube conspiracy videos with the hypnotizing music in the background. If you think that this guy is a hero for hurting our national security or that 9/11 was an inside job or that Obama was a bad President when the data says otherwise, then you should seriously consider getting on some kind of medication or checking into a mental facility.

Even if they had 1 MILLION (but realistically less than 10,000 on 10 hour shifts)  people working for this part of the government, that would mean that each person would have to watch 300 cameras and text message conversations at once. And  if you were always being watched then why haven't half of you been busted for pirating movies and music? The govt could make serious bank on this surveillance system if they used it for petty crimes and to watch people jerk off, but they don't. They use it to prevent serious disasters.

"" Nobody should ever need to justify why they ""need"" a right, the burden of justification falls on the one trying to tear that right away.And even if they did, you can't give away the rights of the people right because you think that ""having nothing to hide"" is a reason not to have it.  The right to privacy is the tight to self. You decide what to share about you, and what not to share about you. As long as there have been windows, there have been curtains. Privacy is a part of basic human nature, and most reasonable people are grateful for the fact that we've been provided with the tools to keep said privacy secured. By your logic, you wouldn't give a damn if I broke into your computer, phone, or home because you have ""nothing to hide"" from me anyway. In truth, it doesn't fucking matter, because your property is YOUR property, not someone else's to go through.  Not to mention the fact that the NSA themselves admitted to twelve specific instances of employees ""misusing"" their surveillance programs (https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/press_room/2013/grassley_letter.pdf). I don't quite believe that you wouldn't give a damn if someone broke into something containing your personal information and shared it with others or some such related thing.   Also, historically, intelligence programs have COMPLETELY violated protocol, causing mass disruption in multiple LAWFUL CONGREGATIONS OF CIVILIANS, including Civil Rights movements (e.g Martin Luther King Jr.), anti-war and violence activists, Puerto Rican Independence groups, and others. COINTELPRO is one of the most well known intelligence agencies for this.

It is part of your contract with whatever organization you sign up for (armed forces, CIA, NSA, etc.).  It says that you will not in any form release classified material to the public.  It also states the punishments for doing so.  If you sign it, then you are bound to it just like anything else you sign in a contractual agreement.  This is fact, this is reality.  What he did is just like giving away your football teams play book to opposing football teams.  When enemies find out how we do things, they have the upper hand.  Given enough info, we not only lose battles, but wars.  Knowing the enigma code in WW2 was a major factor to our victory over Germany.  Alan Turing, who made that possible, was a cryptologist, the same thing Snowden was.  When he told the public what he did, he let the world know.  All it would take is one terrorist changing how he operates based on Snowden's info.  When enemies change tactics, it can often take a long time to gather any more information about him.  Information like what he is doing and when.  So, then attacks happen because we weren't able to get the info necessary to stop the attack in time.  We live in a strange time as our freedoms pose us a major risk too.  I'm not sure how you can secure everyone here and NOT monitor cell phones and internet.  Most of what he says is probably BS.  Think of how many emails, text messages, and cell p hone calls go on each day.  There is no way in hell that any organization could hire enough people to monitor all of them in real time.

The data is even tied to all your known IP NIC card devises you have ever used and they share it with the government without any warrant or cause. They even changed the rules on prepaid cards. You have to show state issued ID that is stored and forwarded to the government. So they know who you are all the time and what you buy.

2016-05-03T21:33:25,"The worst and saddest feeling about watching porn is when you spend time  laying out 10-15 tabs of your favorite porn scenes hoping to go through  all of them, but end up nutting on the 3rd scene.... You then accept  the fact that you failed and tried to move on with your life, but you  come to your senses and realize that you just nutted to an ugly bitch  who's the most likable thing about her was her ass. So you say ""Oh, hell  naw"" and reopened those 9-14 tabs because your ego won't let you go to  sleep with that L. After a 30 minutes break of regenerating semen, you  decide to go back at it. You beat scene 1, then scene 2, then the THE  3rd!, THE FOURTH!!!...you're on fire, you feel unstoppable. You feel  like you can take those 14 scenes down easy. But on the 5th scene, your  neck starts to get tense. Your back start to hunch like Quasimodo and  your nutsack got tighter than a balloon knot... You on the verge of  cumming, but you don't worry. It's all good this time. Unlike the last  bitch you nutted to, this one is bad af.  You were looking forward to  level up to the 6th scene, but after this bitch did some crazy  upside-down-sideways-behind-the-back-under-the-leg shit on the dick, you  said ""GODDAMN!!! Fuck these other 9 scenes, I'm finna nut to this bitch  right here!!!""....... That's where you fucked up... You decide to nut, but you quickly tried to hold and push the nut back  in because something worse than the ugly bitch happened. In the middle  of your orgasm, the camera cuts from the sexy bitch and got fixed right  on the guy's hairy ass. You got pissed and tried to rewind it back to  the girl but your weak ass left hand keeps fumbling with the mouse. By  the time the girl is in view, it's already too late. With the nut now  leaking out, you tried to reach for something to clean it up, but you  forgot to prepare fresh napkins. The only napkin near you was the one  you used on your first nut. You still tried to use it to clean yourself  up, but it's way too wet. It still hasn't dried from the first cum  explosion yet. Now, having nothing dry in arm's reach to clean yourself  up with and feeling defeated, you slowly lean yourself back in the chair  and just sat there for a good 2 minutes, just looking at the cum oozing  from your cock onto your right hand... As you're looking at all the  mess, the computer has been inactive for 2 minutes, so the screen went  black. You lift your stare from your cum covered hand back up to the  monitor to close the tabs, only to catch your sad and depressing  reflection on the screen. Feeling low and dispirited, you close all 10  tabs 1 by 1 with a struggling left hand while your right hand is still  holding your semen dripping penis. You then sucked your teeth and got up  to go rinse your dick in the sink. While you're in the bathroom  scrubbing off the cum stuck in between your knuckles, you caught a quick  glimpse of yourself AGAIN in the mirror.......... pausing for a moment,  you stared at your depressed and hopeless reflection staring right back  at you. You began contemplating your life's purpose while a single tear  trickled down your left cheek.......... You finally shake your head in  disappointment and went back to the bedroom to sleep in the shape of an  L.",1,0,Derrick,QlSAiI3xMh4,-0.028566246150201383,2016-05-03 21:33:25,True,True

2016-08-07T11:34:02,"Totally looking forward to the amount of inaccuracies this film will spout about section 702 & 215. For a detailed, accurate understanding the following citations do very well at dispelling such common myths. 'In Defense of FAA Section 702: An examination of its justification, operational employment and legal underpinnings' http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/indefenseoffaasection702_inglis-kosseff.pdf ""If NSA employees fail to follow any of the detailed limitations on their ability to collect or use the Section 702 data, they are subject to a number of internal compliance positions, including the employees‚Äô supervisors, NSA‚Äôs director of civil liberties and privacy, NSA‚Äôs general counsel, and NSA‚Äôs inspector general. And while concerns about potential abuse properly inform the diligence with which controls are designed and enforced, numerous and extensive investigations conducted by outside parties before and after the sensational claims of Edward Snowden in 2013 have yet  to document a single case of abuse of Section 702 data by an individual or a systemic abuse by the NSA. Indeed, as Geoffrey Stone, the Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of Chicago and a member of the President‚Äôs 2013 NSA Review Group, stated in an op-ed in March 2014: _From the outset, I approached my responsibilities as a member of the Review Group with great skepticism about the NSA. I am a long-time civil libertarian, a member of the National Advisory Council of the ACLU, and a former Chair of the Board of the American Constitution Society._ _To say I was skeptical about the NSA is, in truth, an understatement. I came away from my work on the Review Group with a view of the NSA that I found quite surprising._  _Not only did I find that the NSA had helped to thwart numerous terrorist plots against the United States and its allies in the years since 9/11, but I also_ _found that it is an organization that operates with a high degree of integrity and a deep commitment to the rule of law._ _Like any organization dealing with extremely complex issues, the NSA on_ _occasion made mistakes in the implementation of its authorities, but it invariably reported those mistakes upon discovering them and worked conscientiously to correct its errors._ _The Review Group found no evidence that the NSA had knowingly or intentionally engaged in unlawful or unauthorized activity. To the contrary, it has put in place carefully-crafted internal procedures to ensure that it operates within the bounds of its lawful authority.""_  And the conclusion: *A complete examination of Section 702 reveals a program that is painstakingly designed* *to protect the privacy of US persons to the greatest extent possible while also* *gathering valuable intelligence for national security.* *Section 702 achieves the twin goals of the Constitution‚Äôs* *preamble: providing for the common defense and securing the blessings of liberty.* And as noted in an extensive 2013 analysis, the United States is the only nation in the world where ‚Äú. . . _such surveillance is subject to review by courts presided over by_ _federal judges,_  _with appeals possible to the US Supreme Court._ _The law enforcement agencies tasked with complying with FISA_ _are required to provide regular compliance reports to the_ _Congressional committees with responsibility over national security.‚Äù_ Given the Constitution‚Äôs mandate for limited but effective government, this burden is both appropriate and well imposed. It remains the gold standard in a world searching for the means to achieve the dual aims of security and the defense of individual liberties. *The critics of Section 702 have failed to provide persuasive evidence that Section 702 is either unconstitutional* *or bad public policy, and therefore have not made the case for modification or repeal of the law. For that reason, Congress should* *reauthorize Section 702 without any significant amendments.""  Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board: Report on the Surveillance Program Operated Pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act' https://www.pclob.gov/library/702-Report.pdf (page 50):  'Minimization and Related Requirements: What Are the Limitations Regarding How the Data is Acquired, Who May View It, How Long It Is Retained, and with Whom It May be Shared?' ""Section 702 requires that all acquired data be subject to ‚Äúminimization procedures.‚Äù210 Minimization procedures are best understood as a set of controls on data to balance privacy and national security interests. Specifically, under FISA, minimization procedures must be ‚Äúspecific procedures . . . that are reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the particular surveillance to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons consistent with the need of theUnited States to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information.‚Äù 11Minimization procedures must also contain special limitations on the dissemination of U.S... person identities with respect to certain types of foreign intelligence information,212 as well as allow for the retention and dissemination of evidence of a crime to law enforcement entities.213 These statutory requirements obligate the Attorney General to adopt procedures that balance the at times competing interests in protecting the privacy of U.S. persons and the Intelligence Community‚Äôs production of foreign intelligence information to meet national security requirements. In addition, although the minimization procedures must be designed to protect U.S. persons‚Äô privacy, the procedures will at times provide controls on data that protect the privacy of non-U.S. persons as well.""

After watching the trailer, I decided to added a quick fact about the stud everyone knows as Snowden. On October 26 of 2004, located at Fort Bragg North Carolina, I found myself in a unit by the name of ""The John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Training Center. Here I was in a specific training course named Special Forces Preparation Course Phase one. Here is where I witnessed Edward Snowden during our morning formation, walk out in front of about 50 soldiers, walk up onto a 3-foot-high platform, and with a wooden mallet he struck a copper colored gong (Big round saucer) signifying he quit the course. Edward Snowden was never seen again in any other special forces training courses that I can recall, to include never even going to the actual SFAS to actually begin the Special Forces Training. After Mr. Snowden Quite his butt when ""Needs of the Army"" like everyone else that signed a contract to go through the course. Where he went from that point on I can‚Äôt say, but I love Hollywood and the stretching of the truth and making someone seem cooler then what they really are. My personnel opinion from being around this man, he is a snake in the grass looking for the easy way out of everything (Don't trust him). And by the way, I also was in basic training with Snowden, and for the life of me I don‚Äôt recall him having broken legs, LOL Some people love the spot light and are willing to lie through their teeth to get it.

2016-09-20T21:30:41,"An asymmetric rule of law is the rule of tyrannical men.  The biggest problem in the defense of liberty today is moral decline. Immoral persons appear moral only when the law advances thier appetites' desire - An honorable measure of things is lost when man measures things with his person as the measure. Such a corrupt population will accept corrupt JUDGES, corrupt politicians, corrupt journalists, corrupt military, and corrupt police.  If we fix ourselves fixing our world becomes possible.  But the difficulty is that NOW we are some somewhere in transition.  This can be resolved by once again recognizing that for criminal culpability to attach to the violation of criminal law the act must have been performed with criminal intent - that is intent not driven by an actually higher law.  Under this Snowden's actions do not appear to warrant punishment under criminal law. Snowden's action would still make him civilly liable if his actions damaged the owners of the information by distributing it to others who were not rightful owners of the information.  It appears to me that the information was a public good in that it became more valuable the more widely it is possessed by individuals. If so then Snowden's publication of information created more value than it destroyed. =========================== Is the above the true balance of things regarding the complaints against Snowden?

There were probably others like him but Snowden stands out the most and whats more distrubing is that these Systems of Surveillance have always been label to be random ramblings of crazy old conspiracy theorists. If the extent of power these systems have are exactly what the movie and news media portrays then this has been going on since the wake of WW2. How can we truly stop something that has been building up and lied in wait for something like 9/11 to happen to justify letting these systems loose. I bet before 9/11 systems like these were kept semi in the dark but when 9/11 happened it gave the these systems justification to be fully out there. The government don't need to be cloak and daggers anymore with this and I'm pretty sure on some occasions government officials can out right admit to this type of hacking with little to no consequences.

If you steal top secret information from the CIA, you are gone. Nobody is that smart all the time when you have to fear 24/7 for your life. If the USA want a human being they get him. just like every other nation. I mean how can you believe that? That is just odd and by the way he never said anything that really lead to anything. USA is spying on their citizens. Well and now? Yeah, now you know it and it were not the UNited States of America who had to tell you, nope. You got it nice and sweet from good looking smartass Edward. Oh and by the way his parents were both in the military. Oh sure, all great psychos or heroes or both had parents who worked for the Military. Well I do not buy anything from anonymous nor assange nor snowden. Sorry, if they would give any precise information out it would be ok. Just like damn PANAMA PAPERS... 400 selected journalists get information and decide which information gets out to the media. Fine no problem. After a wek or so it was clear to me (learned from the newspapers) that Putin has money somewhere bla bla oh yeah and some low US people and others. Period. Oh but look at that. When you go to the homepage of the investigative journalists people you find out it is located in washington. And then you click on funders and you see rockefeller and ford and so on (all US funders i think cause all looked like american names but i am from europe so maybe also others are funding that check for yourself). I needed 30 minutes to find out that panama is crap just like so many other things. So if nearly everything you see in the news headlines is Bullshit, well then tell me why snowden is a headline and didn't meet his deadline? :)) oh i am sooo creative. Sorry but it is true if you think about it without prejustice. I really wanted a hero like everyone of us wanted or still wants.

Once you start pushing the boundaries of what they've decided ""Freedom"" is they will began their end game, witch began to really speed up after Trump got elected. Its Nov 12, 2018 now and its beginning to get crazy here. The Progressive Left with their identity politics just won back the House and i imagine will begin worthless and meaningless investigations on President Trump. Not sure how this will turn out but ZERO benefits will come of it, only more hate and division among ourselves and the powers at be know this. The censorship of Conservatives on the internet is beginning, i hope its better now in the time you're reading this, and some, like Alex Jones, have been completely exiled from 95% of the internet outlets. The Left have came up qith umbrella Terms like Hate Speech and Assault Weapons to start censoring and banning of any and all Terms, words and phrases ""They"" deem hateful or offensive. Also any weapons ""They"" want to put under their Assault ban. It was once known as ""Assault Rifles"" but they quickly seen this wouldn't work witg pistols. Is it just a coincidence that we just had two mass shootings done, with legally bought handguns, at a synagogue in Pennsylvania and at a bar in California.They've already scared the County to death over AR-15s and now they must show what a few Glocks with extended magazines and them can do to a bar full of people or a place of worship full of people. But to pull off this final plan of turning the worlds last great place of hope they need new generations that are indoctrinated and brainwashed  by leftist teachers and professors from the 60s and 70s flower power movement teaching our kids and students their propaganda and beliefs of identity politics.  Now we have a generation of millennials who are spoiled sensitive brats that know nothing about the world and are in protest to have their rights, like free speech, taken away, i hope they dont win this fight and yes i do believe it will turn to a fight bc people will not just hand over their guns and give up their rights so easyly. They are in an attempt to get rid of truth and facts like science and Biology proves. People want to be able to identify as whatever, whoever and of whatever race or ethnicity tbey want and at whatever age they wish to be. There is a 69 year old man sueing to be 49 again legally. Now some may laugh at this and think no big deal just let him be whoever he wants at whatever age he wishes, but we cant start down this road of delusions. We, right of  center Conservatives, said this when men wanted to be women legally and look where its led, men winning women sports and beating. Up women legally in MMA fights. I sure hope its better where you people who are reafing this are, that is if some  algorithm hiset search this comment out and deleted it because it is now illegal to talk about your government and open forms like YouTube or is it called StateTube in the future when this is being read. I can only hope the this comment is being seen as only a reminder of how crazy the Left were back in these days and you all are seeing this from a hindsight point of view laughing.

I didn‚Äôt respond but even 15 years later I still feel like I could have done something and I didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt want to deal with going up against anyone or any confrontation. I don‚Äôt know if it was a woman getting raped for sure but I could have done something the way that Edward Snowden did. The man raping the woman would probably have been very upset with me in the same way that the US government is upset with Snowden. At least he did something. There was this person who was not willing to stand idly by when he knew something was wrong. He is the hero I never have been. At least he won‚Äôt look back thinking about what he could have done. The US government was breaking the law. Sorry, but just because you are in a certain type of position where you can break the law in lsecrecy doesn‚Äôt give you the license to do it. The rapist was breaking the law in secrecy too. He felt that just because it was dark and he was behind some bushes where nobody could see him that it would be fine to force himself into this woman. Obama and Trump are both rapists of the American people. They think that as long as nobody can see them it‚Äôs fine because they are above the law. But now it‚Äôs out in the open thanks to Ed. Reminds me of the Rodney King beating too. Thankfully there was someone there who wasn‚Äôt willing to stand idly by while the pigs were killing Mr. King. They filmed it. They took action. I am sorry that I didn‚Äôt in the case of that poor woman who was being raped behind some ‚Äúfirewall‚Äù of darkness and shrubbery. Most people will leave this world never having done anything special. At least Mr. Snowden will be able to look back knowing he made a difference. In Moscow he may end up being snowed in but God, surely will have a place for this angel who was willing to not stand idly by, but to speak up in the same way Jesus did. Snowden may end up crucified but that won‚Äôt matter. This was a life well-lived in service of the Truth. Big thanks!
