2018-08-23T03:56:25,"Several things, 1st Idris Elba has given some of the most incredible performances over the past decade. His mark is carved in stone as one of the best actors EVER. His skills are well rounded and his diversity is impressive. I'm not saying he has reached God status like Tom Hardy or Gary Oldman but he is definitely one of my favs of all time. Now for the movie. Is there really enough material here to warrant another stranded on a mountain after a plane crash movie. I mean the ENTIRE movie shows nothing but a solid white mountain, and there is only so much that could ever happen. U don't think that maybe, Alive covered all of this already. Or The Edge, Call of the Wild I could go on for days. Unless Idris is going to whip it out and start slapping her face with his bologna, or Bigfoot is going to pop in for a cameo I honestly can't see any possible way to call this ambitious in any way. And by the way, I must admit I have to eat my words regarding Kate Winslet. I was completely convinced that Kate would have exceeded the weight limit for a small plane by now.

2018-08-26T18:17:08,"Breathtaking! And yet another reason why I don't like to fly...This movie is so Beautiful and scary! At one point I couldn't watch and turned it off because I actually thought they really would die out there...but then I checked YouTube :)  --suffice to say this ending is even better :) Of course this never happens in real life. An ending like that. Two things structurally really stood out to me as logical breaks-- 1) Walter (Beau Bridges?) died and there isn't any talk about Walter dying or grieving over him or if he had family? It was just like Poof! Walter's gone. End of Walter. 2) Walter's Dog! As a dog lover the way this gorgeous yellow labrador was basically ignored and not pet or comforted just seemed highly bizarre to me. Both characters kind of cared about ""Dog"", (who really suffered a plane crash too), but just every now and then. It seemed as if ""Dog"" was mostly off camera keeping warm :) and THAT ""Dog"" did not go 3 weeks without any food. Thank goodness!  Anyway, I have had doggies all my life from German shepherds and now a fluffy mix and they all need love and affection. All the time. Not just when it's convenient. Just my take.  I DO love this movie though ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ Kate Winslet is very realistic and lovely.  Idris Elba is like WOW! Such a Beautiful voice, is exceedingly handsome ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ and he does a remarkable job of acting like he doesn't care.  I think these two had great chemistry. It was so cold and heartless when Kate Winslet's fiance gives her that cold hearted speech about how he made a deal to love her, ""even if she'd lost a limb..or something."" Ugh! Seriously!!! So glad she doesn't stay with fuddee duddee him.  The snowy scenery is truly gorgeous.
