So great that I admired her for her performance: first one Selena, second, third the cell, fourth out of sight, angel eyes and then finally for the half heart the movie Enough. I did say only 4 and 1/2 we're actually great, enough was an amazing performance on Jennifer Lopez's card part. Playing a woman who is a victim of domestic abuse, trying to escape her abusive husband with her daughter that part was very much important to the film what was sad was that the part where the wife turns around and goes after her attacker:  the husband and then kills him. That part was just a mockery of the real life women who are involved in situations like the one her character was in. Most times that women who fight back their attackers even kill them in self-defense they end up going in jail and their children are put in foster care system oftentimes which is sad the child ends up growing up hating the mother. The movie Angel Eyes was a very powerful drama mystery romance film, you have one character who wants nothing more than to forget the tragedy of his past and just focus on the future and then there is the other character who doesn't want to forget the past because she can't see the future unless you deal with the past.
