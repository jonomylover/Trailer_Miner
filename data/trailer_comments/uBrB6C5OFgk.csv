2020-05-03T01:39:56,"this is a great movie. I don't know why they sell it as horror, it is a lot more comedy than horror. a girl gets murdered and her day repeats and she gets murdered again. she has to figure out what's going on to stop the day from repeating. getting to the solution is where you see the comedy. and she ""grows "" as a person. she realizes as she keeps repeating the day that she is not a nice person and each day gives her a chance to be nice to people she has hurt. yes, there is horror in that she doesn't get murdered in the same place at the same time, so you see her get brutally murdered several times, in different ways, but horror is only about 10% of the movie.  also, there is a sequel, but it is not a sequel, I don't know why they sell it as a sequel. the sequel is part of the first movie. or a continuation of the first movie. it, literally, starts at the end of the first movie.
