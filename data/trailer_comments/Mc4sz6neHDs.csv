But there's always a catch. If anything, I realize they have to include the proclivities of celebrity life to attract the younger generations of people who need every pair of Nikes and Jordan's and all the new iPhones and iWatchs they need,   But if we had it my way, the true sci-fi thriller,  We would've seen him trying to find a cure for his cancer, even if his body didn't have it, then we would see that the corporation that does these mind transfers somehow caused his cancer, to trick him into funding the corporation with billions of dollars and then when his mind was erased as his donor body's memories resurface, the corporation would deem him useless or expendable.   Then they could do this with everyone they want to get rid of, without worrying about a body to clean up, and Kingsley finds out about this, tries to stop him, even with his memory psychosis, and in his last stand, publishes his study for the cure of cancer but including annotations about what this corporation has down to him.
