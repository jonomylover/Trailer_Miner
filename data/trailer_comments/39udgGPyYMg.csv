THEN I SAW THE TRAILERS FOR GOTG!! and I was like 'LOOK HOW GOOD JAMES GUN IS WITH COLOURS' and then I see what taika is doing with thor.... and I was like: 'surely they can't be sticking with the shit civil war colours for homecoming.....'  and now THIS TRAILER!!! dude the colours!!! its so slight but it's so effective and the highs are golden and really pretty, there's way more contrast in the colours and you have interesting colours in the lows and everything!!! its such a simple change but it made me happy because i hate the look of civil war with a passion...  if you don't believe me, look at the webwings shit from the first teaser and compare it to this!! it looks great now!",0,0,nalbisgames,39udgGPyYMg,0.14944472202034886,2017-03-28 14:15:47,True,True

2017-03-28T14:21:12,"Officially hyped!  Looks like a great original story, without the origin; which is utterly unnecessary at this point. I think this trailer gave a bit too much away about the narrative of the film, in terms of how the story progresses. However, the idea of Spider-Man having already been well established (5 movies in 12 years will do that for a guy) is where this movie seems to start from. In fact he starts at his peak: He has a custom suit, tailored by bloody Iron Man; he knows the Avengers and has gone toe-to-toe with half of them; and he has a massive social media fan-base!  Then some stuff goes down with Michael Keaton's 'Vulture' and a boat full of people; which Spider-Man (with his sweet-as, techie-gizmo suit) thinks he can handle. Turns out Vulture ain't no jobber, and wrecks the boat's day. Iron Man shows up and saves everybody, because he has also been in 5 movies, and only needed one origin story. He chews out Spider-Man for being a stupid, cocky idiot and not calling him, when he is literally in the same city, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! He takes the suit back and now Peter is back to looking like he did, when he fought the Ultimate Warrior; back in 2002.  He then has to mess up Vulture's day, to prove to himself (and everyone) that he can he is still Avenger material; even after the whole emo Tobey Maguire phase. There a fight on a plane; because that's realistically the only way he can fight someone that can fly higher than the skyline. He, presumably, saves the day (Hooray!) and Stark is willing to let him join the club.",0,0,lamprdo,39udgGPyYMg,-0.014155982905982908,2017-03-28 14:21:12,True,True

Then he commits a big heist on a carrier ship and steal something important while spiderman fails. Also he commits a stupid mistake risking lives and tony gets angry. Spiderman loses his suit.

Now in the final fight one of the 2 things will happen. Either vulture fakes a crime and makes ironman go somewhere else while vulture is executing his main plan far away. Or vulture lays a trap and captures ironman where he watches a bomb sorta thing about to go off.

A trailer is not a summary you read behind yhe blu ray dvd you buy. A trailer is a showcase of the shorten route of storyline its gonna go, cinematography and vfx its going to include and in some cases( civil final trailer) a guest surprise character where everyone goes HOLY CRAP its partly both marketing and how the whole drill goes. Maybe some will complain how back in 80's or 90's they don't need to do this and they gross millions and more comparing to their budget. Just so you know, even stsr wars a box office phenomenon had a huge risk flopping. Firstly it wasn't a trend, second it had high budget and a lot of post production support in technicalities it was a big surprise back then even the way they commercialize the first film was just decent due to insufficient funds. Marvel who is now own by disney which is one of the big companies today ruling yours and every kid's parent's wallet has mastermind business leaders planned out every detail on selling their product to you. Showing a trailer of spoilers will not hinder but instead rise up their sales tremendously thanks to supporters and those who are dumb enough to go watch it to prove a point on how this will spoil the whole movie.

I think this is the only thing from the trailer that bugged me. Otherwise the trailer is very good. In my opinion the first trailer was a bit better, mainly because it did what it had to do. Just show us Spidey and his awesome gadgets, tease the villain and that he is a teenager and that's it. Nothing more nothing less. I expected this from this trailer, but we got more information than we needed. For me personally it didn't spoil a lot, but it kinda made the movie more predictable. I know he is in high school, dealing with life and being a superhero and Tony is keeping an eye on him and he is dragged in a fight with a villain, of course the Vulture. That's the basic i knew before the trailer. Now i kinda figured the movie and how it's going to end...

2017-03-28T19:35:34,"To people who keep saying 'I've seen the whole movie by watching the trailer', grow up. What do you expect, this is a superhero movie and in most superhero MCU movies, the plot is simple. Hero goes through trauma, gets powers or abilities and becomes superhero, new threat rises, hero battles threat and loses round one, loses confidence and gives up, only to have his faith restored and fights the threat again and wins. Average superhero plot marvel uses all the time. This trailer shows this give or take. The only thing we find out is Stark intervenes in the boat scene and helps Spider-Man, before taking his suit because he disobeyed him. Hell, I had that already guessed from the first trailer. If you have the whole story people, answer me these questions? Does Spider-Man successfully land the plane on his own? Does Stark help him? Does Spider-Man take on shocker and Vulture single handedly? What happens to Shocker and Vulture at the end of the film? Do they die or will they live and reappear in the future? How does Spider-Man even defeat two villains teaming on him? What is Vulture's goal in this movie? Is it to kill Stark or destroy his legacy or is it even both? Is there an ulterior motive? Does Peter really get the girl in the end or does he ditch his homecoming date Liz Allen to save the day Spidey style like in the comics? What makes his homecoming dance so significant to the film's plot? Will any other Avengers' guess star in this movie. Is J.Jonah Jameson is this movie? What is Flash Thompson like in the movie? What easter eggs are there? Just a small amount of questions I came up with. This trailer shows us just enough to get an idea of the plot of the film and give us a taster of what to expect. Don't nitpick when there really isn't anything to nit pick about. CGI may not be up to scratch but the film is about 3 months off yet, so it's not like this is the final product.",17,2,Jon Arbuckle,39udgGPyYMg,0.05694133452754143,2017-03-28 19:35:34,True,True

In the last trailer it ends with a cliffhanger about that boat scene, now in this trailer we know the result of that scene. Which is pretty bad marketing in my opinion. It would've been great to see the movie and watch that scene without knowing the outcome. Knowing the outcome of that scene takes away from the experience and overall will make my viewing experience not as enjoyable. Something similar happened last year with Civil War and the scene where War Machine gets injured. I knew the outcome, so it took away emotion from the actual movie. Also we see that Stark asks Peter for the suit back which is another kinda large spoiler in the sense that it's probably the high point of a character arch that spider man will go through in this movie. Although we don't see the result of this arch in the trailer, we see event causes problems for our character, which is a HUGE part of a character arch.

2017-04-01T18:14:35,"The reasons Spiderman has had three reboots in the past 15 years is because of film complications during production of the sequels. First, it all started in 1996 when Marvel almost went bankrupt, in an era to save the company, Stan Lee decided to sell the Spiderman Film Rights to Sony Productions. This saved the Marvel Company from becoming bankrupt, and Sony later made three Spiderman movies starring Tobey Maguire, in a rush to make the fourth sequel, the company couldn't agree on a strong plot that’s when Sony cancelled the Spiderman franchise. In later years during 2012, Sony thought that they might give Spidey another chance, and that’s when they made the Amazing Spiderman movies with Andrew Garfield. After the second Amazing Spiderman sequel crashed and burned in the box office, Sony decided to cancel it again. Marvel at this point had already set up the MCU and was begging Sony to let Spiderman join their MCU. After lots of planning, Sony and Marvel decided to share Spidey and thus now letting Marvel add him a new spot in the MCU.",0,0,Jensen Evans,39udgGPyYMg,0.20179063360881544,2017-04-01 18:14:35,True,True

I like that Andrew's SpiderMan made his own suit. That showed genius and that we was frugal with what cash he had. Also IronMan made the Iron Spider Suit, now if we get to see that ever, it's not gonna be as special.  I like that what could be called the ""Gwen Stacey Arc"" had ended, we could have moved on to a new chapter in his career.  I like that we had established villains already. Hobgoblin, Electro, Rhino, plus the rest of the 6 underway.  And while I fully recognize that Civil War movie was WAY different from the comics, SpiderMan was already an established hero by the time that story rolled around and he got roped in and SCREWED by Stark.   This SpiderMan seems weaker by comparison, SpiderMan does not take unmasked lectures from other heroes, he tells'em to stick it and keep doin his thing.  Does the suit make the man, we all already know the answer, but I don't feel like the question should have ever been asked.

This film was amazing and is a great to every Comic Book and even movie can put there. Finally after so long they got it right, and thank the lord Sony gave the rights back to Marvel! Let's start off with the actors. THEY WERE ALL GREAT...most of them. What can I say about Tom Holland that I along with everyone have not said already! HE IS INCREDIBLE AS SPIDEY! Not only is he incredible, but he is the best Spider-Man ever, and the best Spider-Man we will ever have. The way he talks, his emotions, his life, his age, his humor, his wittyness, his passion, live, care, and the way he acts is just perfect! He really shows how he was destined to be Spider-Man and Peter Parker! He has some emotional scenes that were done extremely well, but where he shines is his childlike behavior. For so long we have gotten Super Heros that hate their powers and life, and see them as a burden they have to carry. It is so nice and fresh to finally have someone who is happy and excited with their powers! Let's be honest, if we found out we had super powers, we would go crazy. And that is exactly what happens to him! Peter/Tom/Spidey go nuts about his powers, and he gets so anxious, happy, excited, and yes even childish with them! Exactly how Spider-Man should be, especially considering that he is a young kid. They play it realistically, which makes him even more relatable. He is immature and young with his powers, so everything is a thrill ride and learning experience for him, and to watch that is just amazing. And yeah he messed up.......in so many ways😂😂But that is hilarious and sad to watch, and it is done extremely well. Peter along with the other kids of the film....act like kids! It was great to see! It is like going to a regular High School and going through your day. It seems real and relatable. They act like young kids going through their daily lives and that was so satisfying to see. Tom Holland is spectacular as Spider-Man and Peter Parker! I said it from the begining, HE IS THE BEST SPIDER-MAN EVER! Zendaya was great in this film! She was not in it too much, but she delivered extremely well. She was hilarious and added something unique to the film. She added mystery, humor, and something else I cannot put my finger on....BUT I LOVED HER! Michael Ketton was awesome in this! I loved his motivation and how interesting he was. He is soooooo menacing! You understand where he is coming from, but he scares the shit out of you😂 Michael was awesome as Vulture! Marisa Tomei is great as Aunt May! She cares for Peter so much, and she emotionally grips you with her love for Peter. She is funny, charming, caring, attractive and extremely protective. She is perfect for Aunt May and her scenes with Peter are great! Jacob Batalon was great as Peter's best friend! He was hilarious and made everyone in the audience laugh! Tony Revolori was a different Flash, but he was good. Not in it for too long, but he was good. And Robert Downey Jr....you all knew he was going to be great like come on he never faiis as Tony. He is a mentor and Father Figure for Peter, even though he is not ""the best"" at it. He is still a little bit of a sick to Peter, but you can tell he cares so much about him. He shows up when he messes up and tries to set him straight. His scenes with Peter are amazing to watch and it feels so real and capturing. It feels like a father is setting his son straight. That is their relationship, Father and son. RBJ/Tony was great in this film. He is not in it for that long, and you see more Tony Stark than Iron Man, but he delivers as always. Now he is a negative. Luara Harrier is not bad in the film, but she seems so forced and randomly placed their. I feel she serves no real purpse in the film and that she was just placed their for a love story. I was not a fan of the romance, but I understood it and appreciated it is that makes sense.       The action was superb and had an exciting atmosphere that created a very fun and crazy tone. The style of action and fighting really brought another mostly fresh take and door opening to the MCU. A lot of exolosions, alien guns, missles, , web slinging, punching, hard hits, and more was included in the film, and man was it awesome! I have always loved the way Spider-Man fights. To see him beating up bad guys, swinging from building, flipping, and so on was just thrilling! The action scenes were fantastic and the way their were filmed and choreographed was amazing. Loved the action! The movie looks splendid and solid too. You really feel like you are in New York City with him swinging or walking around. All the set pieces and locations they picked were spot on and incredible. The action was what I like to call ""Spider-Man"" action, which is the most or some of the most unique Comic Book action and action in general you will ever see. Every action sequence felt real yet Comic Book like. This movie is ridiculously fun, like I mean this is one of the most fun and entertaining films in a long time or ever! I had a blast watching this film, to the point where my be in exploded (not really but it felt like it did)! I was incredibly entertained watching this movie! And my God is this film hilrious!? THE WHOLE AUDIENCE WAS DYING FROM LAUGHTER EVERY SECOND! I was not able to breathe! It is incredibly funny, charming, witty, clever, and unexpected! Every joke landed for me, and that last scene.....THAT LAST SCENE😂😂😂😂😂IT WAS SO UNEXPECTED AND CLEVER! It shocked the packed auditorium, but we alI died of laughter. I have not laughed that hard in a long time! That is one of my favorite movie endings for a Comic Book movie ever, or movie ever. AMAZING! And also note that my audience was gasping at certain parts! Their is a moment in the film that is so unexpected and shocking, THE WHOLE AUDEIENCE GASPED AND WAS TALKING! I heard a few people say something like ""OH SHIT""!I LOVE THAT SCENE! Seriously like I am going to remember that moment because of the atmosphere, reaction, and scene. It was so tense!       All in all, I FRICKIN LOVED SPIDER-MAN:HOMECOMING! It is one of my favorite comic movies ever and one of my favorite movies in a long time. I recommend everyone to go check this movie out, if you weren't going to already for some reason😕. If your a comic book fan or movie fan, this movie will blow your hearts away and satisfy you. A great film that anyone can love. Great Job to the cast of Spider-Man:Homecoming for the great marketing, promoting, interviews, merchandise, hype, and overall great movie. Thank you Marvel for giving out another hit and saving Spider-Man! This is one of the best Comic Book movies ever, the best film of the summer so far, and the best Comic Book movies in years. The perfect Spider-Man movie, and damn near a perfect film!

But _Homecoming_ is my favourite of the bunch. 2017 has been a great year for the Superhero genre, and _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ does nothing to buck that trend. It's got everything a Spider-Man movie should have: Heart, humour, action, spectacle, a grounded school life, coming-of-age themes, and all this while firmly rooting itself in the Marvel Cinematic Universe -- without relying on the framework of the past to hold it up. _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ is spectacular, and it stands up both on its own, and as a part of the larger universe. _Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it.
