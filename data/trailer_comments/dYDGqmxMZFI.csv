The Transformers don't talk especially Optimus Prime, Bumblebee is obviously not gonna to talk because he still using that stupid ratio voice in 2:00, the Transformers look really weird especially Bumblebee, Mark Wahlberg's character had talk in the entire trailer, the female lead character has no cuts or dirt marks on her face because Michael Bay is making her an eye candy and a damsel in distress, and the trailer really didn't make the movie more interesting because all the explosives and destructions are the same like the other Transformers trailers.  The only good thing happen in this trailer is the Dinobots of course, I mean Grimlock looks so badass but I hope they gave some actual personality and a lot of screen time but I doubt it because the 4th movie is going to be like the last two movies.

The story was engaging, the special effects were obviously jaw dropping, the characters were brilliant and cheesy, strong female characters, massively expanded universe with lots of exposition. The origins of the Transformers was explained, but left questions that may be revealed in the next installment.  The Autobots were each given loads of screen time, had plenty to say, Galvatron was amazing and sounded just like G1 Megatron, his story was amazing especially how he was the real one in control. Lockdown was a really great villain - ruthless, brutal, an utterly cold killer who was, refreshingly for a villain, ambivalent towards humans. Poor Ratchet and Leadfoot... their fates really made me hate Lockdown.  Michael Bay has outdone himself this time and has really breathed new life into Transformers. This film is completely different in tone to the previous three - Mark Wahlberg had a really good performance, his character was very relate-able and much easier to sympathise with than Sam Witwicky who I found obnoxious.  Of course it was cheesy, but it's Transformers so why would you expect otherwise? My jaw dropped, I got goosebumps, shivers down my spine. I was blown away by this film. Funnily enough though I watched the first Transformers film from 2007 and I said to myself ""this is stupid, it barely shows the Transformers! If only it showed them more, it would be amazing.""

2014-07-22T12:10:13,"I did enjoy this film, but the whole time I was watching it, I felt as though there was something missing from it - although there were MANY things it did better than all of its predecessors, it seemed as though it had lost some of its heart. The dreadful ""comedy"" from the previous films is gone. The human characters are, generally speaking, much better this time around; I do miss Shia LaBeouf, but Mark Wahlberg plays a more heroic character who actually gets in on the action rather than hiding and screaming for Optimus or Bumblebee every five seconds. Meanwhile, Kelsey Grammer makes a great human antagonist while Stanley Tucci plays a fun, likeable and genuinely hilarious billionaire inventor. Lockdown is a genuinely compelling villain who brings tension to every scene he appears in. Optimus' character has changed from a righteous leader to an aged, weary and ruthless loner, having lost his faith in humanity throughout his time on Earth. The story - specifically, depicting humanity's discovery of 'Transformium' and Megatron's return in the form of Galvatron - is exciting and original, even if it disappoints many fans with the lack of Unicron (but heck, he's guaranteed to turn up sooner or later anyway). And speaking of the Transformers in general, there are only about 10 in total again, much more akin to the first film than the second and third (which each featured around 30). But despite all this... I dunno. Where was the epic main theme, or the cheesy (but awesome and memorable) quotations? There wasn't even a single scene that seemed intended to provoke any form of sadness or emotion of any kind. Although the action was possibly the best the series has seen, the film's darker tone sometimes made it feel so flat and soulless that it actually started to bore me towards the end.  If Michael Bay can find a compromise between the tones of this film and the previous ones for the next film then he'll be onto a winner, but with Age of Extinction I feel as though he tried so hard to make it more mature that he killed its spirit.",0,0,Scrummy64,dYDGqmxMZFI,0.15340476190476188,2014-07-22 12:10:13,False,True

Decepticons have gathered once again, but in much greater number, and launched an all out attack on Earth. This time they aren't trying to make humans their slaves but to kill them all with no exceptions as an act of revenge.   Only a few Autobots have remained to defend people and It's obvious that they won't be able to succeed by themselves.  Sam decides to sacrifice his human form and turns into a Transformer himself knowing that's the only way to help Autobots defend against the horde of Decepticons.   How would he do that? Optimus Prime hands Sam his Matrix and Sam stabs himself in the chest. Shortly after he falls down on the floor dead. He then starts to decompose into a billion of nanobots which then reassemble into a robotic organism that is Transformer.   Sam (now a badass looking robot) continues to fight alongside Optimus and BumbleBee in an epic fight to save the Earth and the Humanity.",12,6,Krešimir Kocijan,dYDGqmxMZFI,0.009629629629629629,2015-08-02 14:48:01,False,False
