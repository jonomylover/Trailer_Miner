He moved when he was 3 years old. And attended uk schools of drama. Come on. HES an ENGLISH ACTOR. You want specifics perhaps i need to be more clear.

His teammates said he saved about 100 people all by himself, but Desmond said ""it couldn't have been more than 50"" so they took the average (50+100)/2=75.

2016-07-29T15:11:49,"Don't forget Hillary the same person who was responsible for Benghazi, and innocent American lives lost. Also consider she wasn't even in the position of commander in chief and still couldn't protect our fellow American. Read this first before making assumptions about Trump and how some people say, ""I don't trust Trump in office."" The hardcore facts are Hillary can not own up to her mistakes, she often blames others. For example emails being leaked, she blames them on Russia and China, when she dodges the point of what she says in those emails. When Benghazi happened a week later she decided to collapse and hit her head and not taking responsibility for her mistake not doing her job right. My second point that she says what the people want to hear. For example forcing insurance companies to make transsexual surgeries covered. Why waste money on things like that when some one has to pay a deposit in order for them to get a heart transplant. Stop wasting money on passing bills to get transsexual bathrooms and gay rights. That money can be used for our future generations education, job creation, road work, building public facilities which less fortunate people can use. Last point to make short. Why are we bringing terrorists in this country???I have traveled to majority of these middle eastern countries and they hate foreigners like us, they spit at us. They wont let us live in their country, why should they be allowed in ours? With Hillary another tragic day like 9/11 will occur. We need put national security first and build up our economy, and a president who wont be scared to tell the truth. The truth will hurt some, but its better to be hurt than dead.#trump2016",0,0,Ralph Northam,s2-1hz1juBI,0.03008658008658008,2016-07-29 15:11:49,True,True

2016-07-29T18:45:27,"Desmond T. Doss  He was a company aid man when the 1st Battalion assaulted a jagged escarpment 400 feet high. As our troops gained the summit, a heavy concentration of artillery, mortar and machine gun fire crashed into them, inflicting approximately 75 casualties and driving the others back. Pfc. Doss refused to seek cover and remained in the fire-swept area with the many stricken, carrying all 75 casualties one-by-one to the edge of the escarpment and there lowering them on a rope-supported litter down the face of a cliff to friendly hands. On May 2, he exposed himself to heavy rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a wounded man 200 yards forward of the lines on the same escarpment; and 2 days later he treated 4 men who had been cut down while assaulting a strongly defended cave, advancing through a shower of grenades to within eight yards of enemy forces in a cave's mouth, where he dressed his comrades' wounds before making 4 separate trips under fire to evacuate them to safety. On May 5, he unhesitatingly braved enemy shelling and small arms fire to assist an artillery officer. He applied bandages, moved his patient to a spot that offered protection from small arms fire and, while artillery and mortar shells fell close by, painstakingly administered plasma. Later that day, when an American was severely wounded by fire from a cave, Pfc. Doss crawled to him where he had fallen 25 feet from the enemy position, rendered aid, and carried him 100 yards to safety while continually exposed to enemy fire. On May 21, in a night attack on high ground near Shuri, he remained in exposed territory while the rest of his company took cover, fearlessly risking the chance that he would be mistaken for an infiltrating Japanese and giving aid to the injured until he was himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a grenade. Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his own injuries and waited 5 hours before litter bearers reached him and started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank attack and Pfc. Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby, crawled off the litter; and directed the bearers to give their first attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was again struck, by a sniper bullet while being carried off the field by a comrade, this time suffering a compound fracture of 1 arm. With magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a splint and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station. Through his outstanding bravery and unflinching determination in the face of desperately dangerous conditions Pfc. Doss saved the lives of many soldiers. His name became a symbol throughout the 77th Infantry Division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of duty. He also received the medal of honor.",1,0,Sebastian Delgado,s2-1hz1juBI,0.08849673202614379,2016-07-29 18:45:27,True,True

2016-07-30T02:40:22,"ank and organization: Private First Class, United States Army, Medical Detachment, 307th Infantry, 77th Infantry Division. Place and date: Near Urasoe Mura, Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, April 29, 1945¬†‚Äì May 21, 1945. Entered service at: Lynchburg, Virginia Birth: Lynchburg, Virginia G.O. No.: 97, November 1, 1945.      Doss receiving the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman   Citation    He was a company aid man when the 1st Battalion assaulted a jagged escarpment 400 feet high. As our troops gained the summit, a heavy concentration of artillery, mortar and machinegun  fire crashed into them, inflicting approximately 75 casualties and  driving the others back. Pfc. Doss refused to seek cover and remained in  the fire-swept area with the many stricken, carrying all 75 casualties  one-by-one to the edge of the escarpment and there lowering them on a  rope-supported litter down the face of a cliff to friendly hands. On May  2, he exposed himself to heavy rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a  wounded man 200 yards forward of the lines on the same escarpment; and 2  days later he treated 4 men who had been cut down while assaulting a  strongly defended cave, advancing through a shower of grenades  to within eight yards of enemy forces in a cave's mouth, where he  dressed his comrades' wounds before making 4 separate trips under fire  to evacuate them to safety. On May 5, he unhesitatingly braved enemy  shelling and small arms fire to assist an artillery officer. He applied  bandages, moved his patient to a spot that offered protection from small  arms fire and, while artillery and mortar shells fell close by,  painstakingly administered plasma.  Later that day, when an American was severely wounded by fire from a  cave, Pfc. Doss crawled to him where he had fallen 25 feet from the  enemy position, rendered aid, and carried him 100 yards to safety while  continually exposed to enemy fire. On May 21, in a night attack on high  ground near Shuri, he remained in exposed territory while the rest of  his company took cover, fearlessly risking the chance that he would be  mistaken for an infiltrating Japanese and giving aid to the injured  until he was himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a  grenade. Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his  own injuries and waited 5 hours before litter bearers reached him and started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank  attack and Pfc. Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby,  crawled off the litter; and directed the bearers to give their first  attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was  again struck, by a sniper bullet while being carried off the field by a  comrade, this time suffering a compound fracture of 1 arm. With magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a splint  and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station.  Through his outstanding bravery and unflinching determination in the  face of desperately dangerous conditions Pfc. Doss saved the lives of  many soldiers. His name became a symbol throughout the 77th Infantry  Division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of  duty.",2,1,5588joebeck,s2-1hz1juBI,0.08839181286549706,2016-07-30 02:40:22,True,True

Astonishing story, once he was caught by polizai (Russians who supported Germans) they where too busy, the weather was bad (blizzard) so they shoot him in the back, but the wound was light. In few moths he met those polizai in convoy ambushed. He said that it was surprisingly easy (for 16 year boy) how quickly and easy he killed 4 armed men with dagger jumping in their wagon from the roof of the barn. During breaking from encirclement by regular German units. his detachment was forced to cross the road - 100 m of open place close to German  positions. 2 machine guns provided covering fire taking all enemy fire without any cover - 12 machine gunners where killed one after one, he was second in the line to replace dead gunners when convoy crossed the road.

Rank and organization: Private First Class, U.S. Army, Medical Detachment,  307th Infantry, 77th Infantry Division. Place and date: Near Urasoe  Mura, Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, 29 April-21 May 1945. Entered service at:  Lynchburg, Va. Birth: Lynchburg, Va. G.O. No.: 97, 1 November 1945.  Citation:  He was a company aid man when the 1st Battalion assaulted a jagged  escarpment 400 feet high As our troops gained the summit, a heavy  concentration of artillery, mortar and machinegun fire crashed into  them, inflicting approximately 75 casualties and driving the others  back. Pfc. Doss refused to seek cover and remained in the fire-swept  area with the many stricken, carrying them 1 by 1 to the edge of the  escarpment and there lowering them on a rope-supported litter down the  face of a cliff to friendly hands. On 2 May, he exposed himself to heavy  rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a wounded man 200 yards forward of  the lines on the same escarpment; and 2 days later he treated 4 men who  had been cut down while assaulting a strongly defended cave, advancing  through a shower of grenades to within 8 yards of enemy forces in a  cave's mouth, where he dressed his comrades' wounds before making 4  separate trips under fire to evacuate them to safety. On 5 May, he  unhesitatingly braved enemy shelling and small arms fire to assist an  artillery officer. He applied bandages, moved his patient to a spot that  offered protection from small arms fire and, while artillery and mortar  shells fell close by, painstakingly administered plasma. Later that  day, when an American was severely wounded by fire from a cave, Pfc.  Doss crawled to him where he had fallen 25 feet from the enemy position,  rendered aid, and carried him 100 yards to safety while continually  exposed to enemy fire. On 21 May, in a night attack on high ground near  Shuri, he remained in exposed territory while the rest of his company  took cover, fearlessly risking the chance that he would be mistaken for  an infiltrating Japanese and giving aid to the injured until he was  himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a grenade.  Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his own  injuries and waited 5 hours before litter bearers reached him and  started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank  attack and Pfc. Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby,  crawled off the litter; and directed the bearers to give their first  attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was  again struck, this time suffering a compound fracture of 1 arm. With  magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a  splint and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station.  Through his outstanding bravery and unflinching determination in the  face of desperately dangerous conditions Pfc. Doss saved the lives of  many soldiers. His name became a symbol throughout the 77th Infantry  Division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of  duty.",1,0,Jared Maxfield,s2-1hz1juBI,0.0656125356125356,2016-07-31 16:47:23,True,True

2016-08-01T06:14:05,"Below is the citation for why Desmond (character film is based on) received Medal of Honor-medal, read and cry.   He was a company aid man when the 1st Battalion assaulted a jagged escarpment 400 feet high. As our troops gained the summit, a heavy concentration of artillery, mortar and machinegun fire crashed into them, inflicting approximately 75 casualties and driving the others back. Pfc. Doss refused to seek cover and remained in the fire-swept area with the many stricken, carrying all 75 casualties one-by-one to the edge of the escarpment and there lowering them on a rope-supported litter down the face of a cliff to friendly hands. On May 2, he exposed himself to heavy rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a wounded man 200 yards forward of the lines on the same escarpment; and 2 days later he treated 4 men who had been cut down while assaulting a strongly defended cave, advancing through a shower of grenades to within eight yards of enemy forces in a cave's mouth, where he dressed his comrades' wounds before making 4 separate trips under fire to evacuate them to safety. On May 5, he unhesitatingly braved enemy shelling and small arms fire to assist an artillery officer. He applied bandages, moved his patient to a spot that offered protection from small arms fire and, while artillery and mortar shells fell close by, painstakingly administered plasma. Later that day, when an American was severely wounded by fire from a cave, Pfc. Doss crawled to him where he had fallen 25 feet from the enemy position, rendered aid, and carried him 100 yards to safety while continually exposed to enemy fire. On May 21, in a night attack on high ground near Shuri, he remained in exposed territory while the rest of his company took cover, fearlessly risking the chance that he would be mistaken for an infiltrating Japanese and giving aid to the injured until he was himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a grenade. Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his own injuries and waited 5 hours before litter bearers reached him and started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank attack and Pfc. Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby, crawled off the litter; and directed the bearers to give their first attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was again struck, by a sniper bullet while being carried off the field by a comrade, this time suffering a compound fracture of 1 arm. With magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a splint and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station. Through his outstanding bravery and unflinching determination in the face of desperately dangerous conditions Pfc. Doss saved the lives of many soldiers. His name became a symbol throughout the 77th Infantry Division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of duty.",1,0,silphaatrata,s2-1hz1juBI,0.08849673202614379,2016-08-01 06:14:05,True,True

Though we can acknowledge that such a figure as ""Pvt. Doss"" is incredibly heroic and should be commended for their valor, this is not a message or a goal for all of our soldiers. This case study is not widely applicable to the vast majority of soldiers, especially those whose military occupational specialties are in combat arms.   There are a number of military occupational specialties that allow individuals to serve without firing a shot. Except for the Marine Corps, which expects all of its service members to function in the capacity of a rifleman and their own specific MOS, every branch of the military offers non-combat roles that allow individuals to serve their country without killing anyone.  This film is not necessarily a social justice warrior piece of propaganda. Such a story is incredibly moving and can certainly serve to display the struggles of our brave servicemen. That said, if it overly brutalizes or crudely displays the personalities and actions of the soldiers, then it probably is. But don't make assumptions.  The reason I'm writing this is because I don't want a bunch of idealists in our military. With Trump or Clinton at the helm, you should expect to get your hands dirty if you're in combat arms. While we can afford a Pvt. Doss here and there, an army of pacifists has never won a war. And to the special snowflakes reading this comment: MLK and Gandhi didn't fight wars. They had struggles, but there was no concentrated military effort seeking to capture, kill, or destroy them.

However, I invite all the critics to read more into the real Desmond T Doss, the humble, unassuming man who just wanted to serve while holding dear to his faith at all cost. It's fascinating that some of the negative comments reflect the actual cynicism Doss' fellow soldiers and superiors showed towards him as well. They threw boots at him in the barracks, shamed him, called him cowards, made him clean the latrine, even tried to kick him out and threatened to kill him! When those very same men nominated Doss for nothing less than the Medal of Honor, and when surviving WWII MOH recipients appointed Doss to represent them in 1962 at the White House, their loathing had turned to respect for the man beyond reproach....and you would discover a man of biblical proportions.   ""But the Lord hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and the Lord hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things."" ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.""  I, for one, am humbled and am truly privileged to have discovered Desmond Doss. All my complains, whining, hurt feelings, and vindictiveness are suddenly nonsensical. I can't help but being inspired to be a better, truer person.  I wished I had met him. He had led a quiet life in a town next to mine until his passing in March 23, 2006. A true soldier, and a saint.",1,0,kramotakra,s2-1hz1juBI,0.12222222222222223,2016-08-06 05:25:21,True,True

2016-09-27T09:48:50,"I have known about this real character for some time. When I first came across his story, I decided to do research in order to find out if he really existed and if what I had initially heard had any merit in fact. What I discovered exceeded the initial account about his life I had heard. His whole life was a walking contradiction to the world in which he lived. This man's character and actions as a whole is legendary in the most positive sense of the word. How he was able to live in this world and make it to the end of a long life span is really remarkable because of how he demonstrated through daily action what he said he believed. It is curious how his story is only really known to a specific community of people in our world. This movie appears to finally bring his miraculous life and integrity to a greater audience. It is incongruous that his story is being revealed on a big stage in our society and culture at this distressing time in our country and world. However, his life as he lived it was incongruous with the world and time in which he was living.  We need more people to imitate this man's life.  This trailer appears to get the facts right as far as it can in a trailer. In order to fully appreciate this movie and understand the nuances I saw in the trailer and therefore believe will be in the movie, I suggest you web search Desmond T. Doss. I think that by learning everything you can about him will greatly enhance your experience as you watch the movie. If you don't, I think the amazing things you hear and see in the movie will cause you to greatly question the credibility of this being a true story.  Many comments I read make assumptions from this trailer that are fact incorrect.  I think the quality of this trailer really speaks for itself. It shows great cinematography, a good script, good acting, and potentially a well edited story line. I am not a member of the specific community from which this man came. However, I strive to be his brother in the community in which I believe he is a great example. I intentionally attempt not to reveal to much about Desmond T. Doss. I believe he is a man that deserves being discovered by each individual. If you are interested in being blessed by getting as close as you can to someone of great integrity and stability in this time of chaos and division, than he is worth putting in the time of researching him and seeing this movie.  Also, this story is not about Mel Gibson.  If you don't want to support or be connected to another human who you don't agree with, try disconnecting.

2016-11-14T02:13:34,"In honour of remembrance day, I went and watched ""Hacksaw Ridge"" at the theatre Friday night with some friends.   I thought it was going to be good, but that's an understatement;   WOW what a movie!  It's my 2nd favourite movie of the year hands down, and so fitting for what's going on in our world today.  There are so many levels to it that I was able to connect with and apply to my own life which I seem to do from any thing I watch or read these days.   With never having served in the Canadian military, I truly can never fully understand or appreciate what men and woman have to go thru in war. I have the utmost respect for any human willing to lay their life on the line for their country and communities, military/police/fire fighters etc.   Even though there are many things that greatly saddens me within these institutions, especially the taking of human life, as I believe all life is precious; no one deserves to have their life taken too soon. I do believe in justice and I believe the best system we can have here for that, is some type of prison system where the person has lost their freedom to do what they want. Maybe for more severe crimes more sever prisons....Siberia/The Arctic spring to mind. haha  But it saddens me that so many people will disrespect and burn their countries flag without having a healthy perspective of what their fellow countrymen go thru in trying to serve and protect the best way they know how, even if it is misguided at times. Sure we got good and bad soldiers, cops etc, but we should never blame all for evil of some. There is a reason the divorce rate is the highest amongst marriages that involve those who server in military or some form of police. The trauma and things they have to see, do and go thru, it can easily break your mind/heart. In the USA, 20-22 vets commit suicide every day, so these are serious issues.  We are a broken world filled with angry people and thats what we see and feel throughout history. And you especially see that anger in war and where those who are supposed to serve and protect you are the very ones who are hurting and abusing you. But like the movie illustrates, you can coward and blame others or you can do your best to fight for whats right, even when you feel the whole world is against you.  What is the answer to all that?   For me it's walking in my faith, and that was one of the most amazing theme's of Hacksaw Ridge. How no matter the obstacle, how serious, life and death the situation was, he relied on his faith and it got him threw it; even though sometimes it wasn't till the last second! He didn't blame others for the problems of the world, he just wanted to serve and save lives the best way he knew how.   He lead by example even though he took the beatings the world threw at him from his dad, his own military, to the Japanese, all who wanted to hurt him and even kill him. By leading by example, others wanted to now come up to his level instead of him coming down to theirs. You see this near the end of the movie in the most amazing way.  Spoiler alert...so dont read any further if you are going to go see it, but to see his fellow soldiers wait on going up the ridge for the next assault, because they saw the protection and blessing that God had on his life, they wanted his prayers because it was a miracle what he did the night before!  Before that day, they had assault after assault and failed miserably, with endless dead bodies and a demoralized people. After his prayers, well the American army finally took Hacksaw Ridge. It reminds so much of the old Testament and when God walked with Israel and they succeeded in their battles and when they didn't, their enemies won the battle.   James 5:16...... and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

2016-11-15T15:21:34,"Excruciating,  brutal, dark, intense, gripping, but also well thought out and breathtaking this movie shows why we need Mel Gibson as director today. This film doesn't hold grudges, it is hardcore in your face brutality, but he wanted to show all horrors and pain these conflicts bring and boy did he succeeded in that. Everything is worth of admiration here. Phenomenal performances, especially Hugo Weaving who was on fire in this and astonishing Andrew Garfield, great directing, visual storytelling, awesome special effects and huge props to sound mixers and sound editors because they've done magnificent job in transporting us into the heart of the battle. It is sometimes tough film to sit through, but not without well paced humour, sense of catharsis and spirituality.  If there are gripes about the film it is that some aspects were little bit cliche, especially romance part and some parts of the battle felt exaggerated to pump that american patriotism. In the end Hacksaw Ridge is not recruitment propaganda, it doesn't try to indoctrinate you to become adventist or shove some crazy ideas into your mind. It is just inspirational, full of hope and strong spirit that always overcomes the depression and that place when people are at their lowest. 4,5/5",25,0,ogorjefan,s2-1hz1juBI,0.2162624926513816,2016-11-15 15:21:34,False,True

A caring veteran who doesn't believe guns and his purpose is to safe many soldiers which takes place in Japan. His performance was very intense and maybe, he could be position in the Oscars, but only if they decision because he done amazing job. Not as much of being a weak superhero character in ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but in the good position which I'll be in the next future films. The entire battleground sequence is pretty bloody and reminds like another epic mature war sequence like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and our main character focuses his job to save many soldiers as he can.

2017-03-17T23:21:54,"Well in contrary to most peope here I do not think this movie was a masterpiece, neither is it one of the ""best films ever made"" nor does it deserve an Oscar. While Desmond Doss¬¥ story is indeed a quiet unique and moving one and the main actor delivers a great performance, the rest of the movie just represents the pale generic American war movie you¬¥ve seen a dozen times already + a portion of Gibson¬¥s beloved violence. I have to shake my head when I hear people here telling ""woah the war scenes were sooo real"" which is a dilletantic statement just because visual violence plays a big role. Gibson just created a over-the-top point blank gore fest with gibs flying everywhere around and effects ala Michael Bay instead to potray the true horror of war on a more deep level and perhaps also for both sides (how Refreshing would that be!). Also makes the movie from a military tactical/strategical viewpoint absolutely zero sense, which is especially true for the Japanese side. And eventually - like in your typical America¬¥s hero war movie - you of course have a total dehumanizing and demonization of the enemy - the Japanese who are potrayed like blood-lusting animals constantly busy to do blatant and nasty stuff just in order to serve as a vehicle for American heroic deeds.  If you¬¥ve felt also unsatisfied after watching this movie but are looking for a great movie about the Pacific theatre I¬¥ll recommend you to watch Letters from Iwo Jima which does a great job on the potrayal of good and evil on both sides in war and also The Thin Red Line which is famous not just for its cinematography and psychological aspect but also for the ""Battle for Hill 210"" the first combat scene in the movie which is one of the most realistic war scenes ever created in film.",2,1,Crockett C,s2-1hz1juBI,0.1608730158730159,2017-03-17 23:21:54,False,False

We went to one of the many cells they have in every major city to stay the night but I was refused. The Jew walked out of the cell with me and we shared a room and he treated me.  So don't hate Jews.

It is a great film though and the history behind it is brutal but beautiful. Lots of people do think that saving private Ryan is the best war film ever. No. The first 15 mins are the best I have ever seen, but the rest of the film just loses it for me. No war film is perfect, hacksaw ridge is a great film but not perfect. A perfect world War 1/2 film for me would be one that is historically perfect, visually perfect and a story that most normal people have never heard of before. Also no dramatic shots, so the only time you can see the opposing solider is when the main characters can. You also can only see just over the trench. Also no disrespect but I am tried of American solider movies, a British or French or even a german army perspective would be more fresh. Maybe even have two perspectives from a allied and axis view.

I wish Desmond Doss was alive today  just so I could hug him. Those 75 men who should have died, lived on, had family and their families had families so on, this man wasn't a hero, he was a saint. And don't forget that he wasn't the only one. *SPOILER* During the movie, when he became friends with the soldier that kicked him, reminded me of a story my grandfather told me when I was a young boy. I asked him about war, wanting to know his story. He laughed and said ""even your father wasn't brave enough to ask that, but since you asked, heres some tips. He said don't make friends in war. I asked why? He said I had 2 best friends, we went through allot, and one morning we had to run up a beach. My friend on the left got his face shot off, and my friend on the right got shot down like a dog"" Then he said ""Don't be a hero"" Funny that, He was a war hero. Those words stuck with me forever. Love you granddad. Lost but never forgotten. He only got shot once, and that was by his own man, shot on the back capturing a village in france, He crawled onto a road and a medic drove past, the medic got out, and refused to help him, shortly later another medic came, and drove him 2 the hospital close to the village they we're capturing. after he had healed, he went to the pub of the village they had just captured and seen the medic who left him and he took his pistol out and almost shot him had it not been for another man pushing his hand up. He never slept properly, I remember hearing his screams in his sleep. I never knew what he went through because allot of it he never said, but who would? Just watching this is a small eye opener.

By looking at this trailer the sh_t seems gritty as hell, which means it is probably a close representation of what it was actually like to be there (God bless our fallen soldiers from WWII - and all of our wars to be honest).   I applaud Gibson and everyone else who was a part of this film - especially the actor playing the main character. As for the real life soldier who actually DID this???? I am humbled by the fact that he existed in this same life and reality as I do, but that I could never measure up to him... I salute that  man.   I have NO PROBLEM going into battle or marching straight into the jaws of certain death. I've had some experiences in my life that make me the first guy to volunteer for whatEVER suicide mission is at hand and is needed to help us survive. I have zero fear of death. I can tell you that, because I used to be a boy in life and the kind of person we all start as, where when the going gets tough, and some sh_t comes up that NOone wants to do and probably won't came back from....we would hope we didn't get picked for that mission lol. I remember being that person and what it felt like and I can guaranTEE you that TODAY? NO ONE could ever even be CAPABLE of keeping me from being the first man in line to go do some sh_t that everyone else is too scared to do.   I'm a real man our here. All the little boys can take notes. As for THIS soldier.... This guy is about 100,000 times the man I am, because he wouldn't fire a weapon. By God if I need to go over some hill and kill me some enemies, you strap me up with the right guns and ammo, and you can't stop me from going after that target. I refuse to die a coward. A death while being brave is all I yearn for in this life and will probably be denied it since I'm a civilian now (used to be in the military).   To have the balls to march into battle with NO WEAPON in hand.....and refusing to fire a weapon....I take my hat off and bow down to this man. He redefines brave. Honestly, I suspect he wasn't even all human....the level of power and bravery he exhibited must be on the level of immortal angels walking the face of the earth. I bow down.....",1,0,kin kane,s2-1hz1juBI,0.19922839506172835,2019-04-14 00:52:24,False,False
