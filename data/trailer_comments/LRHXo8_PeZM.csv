It's too bad that they never got to work together.  Maybe if someone produced a sequel to Gentleman's Agreement, RDJ could play the grown up Tommy, Phil Green's son, played then by Dean Stockwell, and Mr. Peck could be shown in flashbacks.  It'll be as if they were in a movie together.",0,0,Cris Guia,LRHXo8_PeZM,0.28,2014-10-19 15:15:01,False,True
