Even though it resembles more similar like homosapiens but there is a limit . like team work , kill, communication and leadership on their own kind , but we humans consider ant as a single sense species only like wise,  cosmos see as a ant .The advance technology like atomic energy/research,genetic research, nuclear weapons/teleportation,time travel, supernatural power, mutant,(Avatar)etc .. are nothing from cosmos view .See for many decades science and religion are two persons ruling the whole world by the law , not the sports/politics/business etc ...which we people didn't understand , it's a hidden truth . Everything happens in earth is fully responsible by this two idiots.If u want any answer about a problem in earth ask them, they knew it ,even the past history and predicted future also they will have records.These two idiot says that from big bang to big crunch will happen, how come they knew it , do they have any super power ha ..... y would we follow them, they are also humans like ours.i wish to speak in Tamil ""Enna avanugaluku rendu komba molachirukuthu "" "" yara nenga "".I am not sure about it but one thing I guess if a person or object / thing  travel at a speed of light itself he could only possibly be reaching 3 to 4 galaxy beyond our milky way galaxy then how come they predict beyond that .They are lying lier.Catch them .",0,0,SHRI Ashok Coimbatore,AaPKmotIpgA,0.06351611351611351,2017-02-09 08:23:38,False,False

When I was on a type of medication called Zolaft, it made me see things that I saw in this movie it gave me terrible hullicanations. For the longest time I would not sleep I would not eat, I just isolated myself. I was so afraid and I thought I was crazy lol. I don't see those things anymore though.. which is good. I would see my wrists cut open, and blood on the sink I would see people's skin turned inside out.. and I sometimes saw myself hanging on a rope, but slowly as I looked at myself my mouth was slowly carving open into a smile. then my eyes opened they were black.. excorsist things came through my head if I tried to sleep. nightmares all the time non-stop. I even had voices in my head telling me to kill myself. I did some crazy things before those pills came along I looked up satanic rituals. and it thought maybe that was my issue because ever since I've done that I became really depressed and suicidal. but now things have changed I still have my self doubt and still feel like I'm not worth anything but I'm atleast off that medication. thanks to the hospital they proceeded to tell me that I was not crazy and that nothing was wrong with me it was only that the medicine did not go well with me and they also said that most of the people that take that medicine almost commit suicide.",0,1,Katie Wilson,AaPKmotIpgA,-0.030833333333333345,2017-04-16 13:31:36,False,False
