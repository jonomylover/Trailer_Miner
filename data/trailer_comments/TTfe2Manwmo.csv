It is possible, that, as a life long film fan and cinematographer, I may have some very legitimate critiques of this trailer and the premise of this film, all of which will immediately get shot down as ""sexist"" or ""butthurt males"" or ""your just mad its all women"", when none of that is the case.  For me, a great deal of these issues comes down to the lazyness of Hollywood, executives, and writers.  Its all about ""lets remake xyz with an abc cast"", and thats just lazy because hollywood is trying to push out films to capitalize on a certain societal trend to make money, not because they genuinely care about forwarding the prominent role of women in film.  You have this amazing cast, why not write a unique, original story that is specific to them, rather than just recycling a male dominated story with a female cast, because, TO ME,  that doesn't move any of the underlying issue forward.  Wonder Woman wasn't' a female version of a male story, it was its own unique empowering story that always had a women at its center, it was built around her, it had her in its DNA.

2017-12-29T01:51:26,"I'M TRIGGERED BECAUSE I'M A MAN !!!!!  OK let me explain to the women in the comments section why men are so triggered by GENDER SWAPPED FILM REMAKES! . It's because it's perceived as an attack on films that are mostly popular with men as if the film in question wasn't good enough and now women want to change that film because they think they can make a better version of it, because they are trying to prove that they are better than men for some reason when we should all really be equal.   The Ocean's franchise is a MAN'S FILM PERIOD ! nearly all the cast were men from the 2001 version because the original Ocean's 11 which was released in 1960 was surprisingly ALL MEN. The other reason it was so popular was because the cast from the 2001 version was an excellent choice of actors, it made all the comradery and banter in the films so much more enjoyable to watch, The cast for Ocean's 8 however is questionable it appears as if Sandra Bullock has rounded up any willing female actors who need a big break to get into the film industry, or who have been in shit films for the last few years and want some success google the cast you'll see what I'm talking about.  The fact is that there is no real reason for trying to make another Ocean's film 16 years later with an all female cast ... because it doesn't make sense for 1 and 2, it's not a spin off of Ocean's 11 yet the core story looks just like Ocean's 11 and is now called Ocean's 8 for some reason? , and 3 there is no new plot line or continuation from Ocean's 13 to distinguish the film in anyway so it is confusing to understand what this film is suppose to be. However after watching the trailer I checked to see why it was called Ocean's 8 and all I could find on Wikipedia is that it's described as "" both a sequel to and an all-female soft reboot of the Ocean's Trilogy and a spin-off of Ocean's 11"" and it's called Ocean's 8 out of choice LOL .... again I'm totally fucking confused.      The problems I'm concerned about with Ocean's 8 is that if it is the same plot as Ocean's 11 or has the best bits of the trilogy for that matter, then why would I pay to watch it if I already know what's going to happen, are they trying to sell it because their an all female cast I mean what are trying to prove ?, it's like saying I'll go and pay to watch The Amazing Spiderman ... but why If I've already seen the Spiderman Trilogy with Tobey Maguire ?. To me you may as well slap a advisory note on the trailer before it begins saying ""FOR WOMEN ONLY"" because you'd have to pay me be a lot of money to watch this shit.   "" Please be advised all opinions and views portrayed in this review are CORRECT! and any thoughts you may have on the matter are WRONG! as I simply don't give a shit and because you  don't understand what your talking about!

If you truly accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, He will let you know what is right. Once you accept Him into you heart it is amazing how clear things become. I cannot tell you what to do about anyone. That is up to you. As I said before, we are all sinners. Once we have Jesus in our heart we will still sin, but if we truly have Him¬†in our hearts, when we sin and realize it we will want to run from it, not to it. To God all sin, any sin,¬†is just as bad any other sin. Lying, adultery, lust, fornication,¬†murder, stealing, and yes, homosexuality. James 2:10. A homosexual is no worse in God's eyes than ANYBODY else and you (and your boyfriend)¬†matter as much to Him as the people that sit in the front pews at church week after week. As a matter of fact there are many parables about how you matter MORE to Him as a lost sheep than those that already belong to His flock. Remember, satan is the father of all lies. So you really cannot believe ANYTHING satan tries to tell you guys. He will say and do anything to take you with him to the lake of fire for eternity (eternal, conscious punishment, not parties and fun with friends). Look up people that have died and gone there (and come back)¬†and see what they say. Jesus loves you, but He will also judge you one day.
