2019-01-31T19:00:59,"I'm so glad they've made this movie, but ad campaign wise? I feel like this trailer is going to compel a lot of already pro-life Christians to flock to the theaters, but no one who needs their minds changed. Anyone pro-abortion would see this trailer and roll their eyes and scoff at all the Christianese and pro-life buzz phrases. Everything from the declaration that it's from the same makers as ""God's Not Dead,"" to the dialogue they included about being a baby from conception and the prayer committing the babies' souls to God is going to drive pro-abortion people away from the theaters, not invite them in to have their perspectives changed. And don't get me wrong, that dialogue belongs in the movie. Just maybe not the trailer, if they actually want to reach the lost. For the trailer, they should have focused more on the angle of finding out what really happens in these facilities, and emphasized how this is a true story. The vast majority of pro-abortion people are not going to want to pay to watch this movie based on this trailer, especially when all the spoilers and plot points are given away already. There's no mystery left here. No intrigue. No ""I wonder what happens in this movie?"" Even the procedure that changed Abby's mind is framed up nice and special in the trailer so that everyone knows THAT'S the moment, and everyone at the movies will know what's coming and it won't be as shocking and jarring as it should be.

2019-02-01T18:32:06,"Thank you so much for making this film! I read the book ""Unplanned"" and it totally changed my life. It helped me to understand Planned Parenthood and the Pro Life movement in a new deep way I did not expect. It showed the humanity of both abortion workers and pro lifers and what can lead someone to think Planned Parenthood wants to help women. Its a story of ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"". Abby's story proves people can change. Abby is one of the strongest voices for life because she has seen both sides and helps women after they have had abortions, abortion workers and women AFTER the baby has been born.

2019-02-02T22:07:38,"As a Catholic Pro-Life Woman, I wish I felt more positive. Some people who read this comment may assume that because I don't wholeheartedly support this film, that I support abortion, or disregard Abby Johnson as bigoted and her story as one-sided.  I do not.  I am an advocate for the safety, health and dignity of all unborn children and the mothers that carry them. Abortion is always a tragedy and those involved and targeted deserve much better. That being said, I am concerned about this film because I believe that the story, struggle, recovery and wisdom of this brave woman will not be given at least an equal placing amongst the message it's trying to send.  As proud as I am of Abby Johnson for being brave enough to hand over her story to the cast and crew, who in turn are brave enough to bring it to life, especially within a pro-abortion world like this, I am not convinced that this film will accomplish its mission. I was looking forward to this film until I saw a statement, from Abby Johnson herself, that the reason for this film's existence was for conversion. In an interview with the directors of the film, they admitted that this film was here to explain the harms of abortion.  As a college Creative Writing student, I can wholeheartedly say, from experience and spectating, that message-driven or purpose-driven stories will always fail to connect with whoever views them, or will only connect with those who understand and not with those willing to give it a chance. This is because storytelling and most forms of art are revolved and are remembered by the journeys, feelings, revelations and respectability of the characters within them. Characters who react to their hardships in the *world.* Storytelling is a way to bond over experience, emotion, desire and acknowledgement of hardships. It is one of the last platforms of unification amongst humans today. I have gotten to know people during my lifetime and heard stories from others that have chosen abortion, even if they know what abortion does, because they did not have the needs to continue the pregnancy, the people to support them, or the means to provide for themselves and stay healthy during the pregnancy.   If a storytelling platform is used for a piece that's main mission is to ""convert"" or to explain to them why they should believe something, by definition, it's propaganda. Audience members and citizens do not go to films or consume any type of entertainment for these reasons. I once heard a saying, ""God does not wish that anybody would perish, but we know that He doesn't force people to turn to him."" If we give people material that is about why they should change their minds, we are communicating that we don't accept them as they are, that we don't trust them to understand our side, and that our side is more important. Instead of being character-oriented, it's self-serving. This type of attitude and treatment, especially towards citizens who don't identify as pro-life, will always divide more than unify. And Abby Johnson's story and struggles are wholly undeserving of such injustice. It can be a fantastic accomplishment if it brought awareness to all struggles surrounding the issue and was dedicated to the perseverance, self-respect, emotions and recovery of the human beings involved, but the purpose of ""conversion"" does not convince me that this will be the case.  I hope that I am wrong about my prediction that this film will not succeed. I hope that Abby Johnson, and the filmmakers, and their followers will continue to fight for the rights of unborn children, and the care taking and empowerment of their often vulnerable, struggling mothers. I hope that this film does inspire some pro-lifers to behave less hostilely towards people who believe differently from them. And yes, I know that because of this pro-abortion world, many people will unfairly judge this film, some without even seeing it. But although this admittedly does look more human-oriented and less black-and-white than most faith and Christian-related films today, I am scared of the outcome because of the statement of purpose from those responsible for it. If we truly want to invite people into our world, we need to make stories about people. Faith-related films such as *The Prince of Egypt* and *Silence* have non-religious fans because they accomplish that. Being a storyteller makes me more human because it makes me more aware and open to human hardships. It doesn't have to have a solution, sometimes just recognition is enough. We will be far better off with trusting our audience's judgements and opinions than trying to format them under our worldview, however noble they might be.",2,0,G.C.

There are 1.2 billion Catholics in this world and there are in excess of 2 billion Christian's in this world and there are well over a billion Muslims in this world who also do not believe in abortion.... and there are many other people who are non religious but who are pro-life because they know how evil it is to tear up a little baby in its mother's womb and/or to take a human life no matter how small or formed.  Do you know the difference we could all make if even half of us stopped making purchases from these companies. When enough of us hurt their bottom line and their profit, they will stop their practices. On top of that we share in the guilt of what they are doing if we knowingly continue to buy from them, unless of course it is a medicine or something you can't absolutely avoid, or something that is free.  Apart from all essential medicines and things like that, I myself have stopped using these companies, and yes, it requires some sacrifice, and yes it requires us to be white Martyrs of the 21st Century, but can anybody tell me that a pair of shoes or a burger or a of soft drink, or accommodation on a holiday you can get somewhere else, or an item on sale at Amazon, is worth Killing babies to have. In many circumstances there are alternatives anyway but even if there are not, I will not do this, even sometimes it will cost a little more. and financially I am not very well off. But I want to put God first. I want to put Jesus first. I want to put these babies and their mother's first.  It is great to go out and watch this movie and to go the prayer vigils, like 40 days for life, etc, and to pray for an end to all of this and for the souls of these babies and their parents, but there is more we can do.... so much more.... but yes, it will hurt.  But think of the Sacrifice Jesus went through on the Cross for us. And think of the sacrifice these little babies are going through when they are TORN APART and mutilated, and being robbed of their lives laid out ahead of them.... And think of the sufferings of their mothers (and fathers too) either or physically (for the mothers) and mentally and spiritually after she [they] realises the truth of what was done.  Please, participate in this, spread this with everyone all over social media and in your circles, and let us do more practically to end abortion, and even more so, as to not participate in it with our money, the money we spend and what we choose to spend it on.  God bless you all good people, and keep up the fight :-) :-) And remember brothers and sisters, love is not just a mere emotion or feeling. Love is an act of the will. And thus, sometimes that act hurts Again, think of the Passion and the Cross of Jesus. True Love can hurt.",3,18,Gary Haber,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.1520988574267263,2019-02-03 00:01:19,True,True

As I have met some pretty happy to not know people. I still leave the choice up to the women. If they decide they want the kid, great! Raise it with care or give it up to hopefully, a good family. And if she doesn't want it, that's her choice. I am still shocked though that in this day and age when Artificial wombs are a thing now that Prolife organizations don't get behind that. I mean if you could just transfer the fetus to that and then it develops people would both get what they want, the child saved and the woman to go free.

We need to be aware that attempting to use the law to underpin the particular stance of our religious beliefs is outrageous. Your god, your church, your religious beliefs, have no place in my life, or the lives of millions of others. The law has to be dispassionate and logical - it has to provide the best basis for the populace.  And if the majority want access to birth control and abortion they should have that access. It's not mandatory - no one who'd choose to use birth control would attempt to force it on you, or force your religion to accept it.

We have progressed to (compassionate?) suicide for terminally ill.  Human life no longer has any value to godless man.  It is a deviation from the ten commandments legislated into law. Legalized murder of innocent and progressing to all human life. This does not stop with unborn children and terminally ill. complete legalized murder for marginalized or undesirables just hasn't been legalized yet.   Why not vote for another Liberal or any progressive government. Coming soon  to a city near you. This is progressive liberalism. Progressive liberalism Is a ever creeping sickness of the mind can justify any perversion. Compassion to these people means that  SJW feminist feelings count yours do not.Their body their world matters not yours or any other. That is compassion. Sacrifice the child for personal freedom. Sacrifice humanity for the environment! The new liberal SJW feminist compassion in Newyork is womens right to have an abortion at any stage. Her freedom not the child's. The doctors pull those babies apart limb by limb piece by piece. If you don't care about a life,consider the pain those babies go through. O' God may they repent? These little people haven't been born yet and all they will ever know of existence is pain. One more nail in the cross of Jesus! What difference does it make if it is killing a life at conception or any time there after?  Life starts at conception. If these legislators are aborted by pulling them apart limb by limb like most of these babies are  would be no less immoral than killing  innocent  life.  These legislators or the mothers life is no more valuable to God than that human life is after conception.  Their life is probably worth less considering that they have no qualms at taking an innocent human life. Let us pray that this abomination will be made to stop. We complain about Islam and Sharia Law.  If  these people won't accept Christian moral values, perhaps its about time to welcome Sharia Law.  At least they don't kill their own innocent. The pink victory symbol they erected is a obelisk (A phallus),symbolizing potency of the sun god Ra!  It is satanic!

God’s Wrath Against Sinful Humanity  God’s Wrath Against Sinful Humanity is being revealed 17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. 18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; 19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. 20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things. 24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves: 25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.  26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31 Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.",0,0,Wade C,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.1574601370851371,2019-02-06 19:24:35,True,True

Abortion is not murder, a fetus is a bunch of cells under scientific definition. It would make a difference if the fetus felt emotional but it doesn’t. Sense when did people’s beliefs over rule science and something that potentially change someone’s life for the better. Planned parenthood makes abortion available to those who need it.  If you don’t want an abortion don’t get it, but don’t make others feel like shit because of a PERSONAL long thought out decision. Abortion is for mothers who want a child to come to the world loved and cared for properly, because guess what, it’s a another freaking person. Would you rather to have a kid come to a world into a un loving home, a place with barely any food on the table, with abusive parents, and have to deal with that all by themselves? Is that better than waiting to be able to have a child in the first place?! Plus taking away a women’s RIGHT to have a SAFE and LEGAL abortion doesn’t make abortion rates go down, in fact it increases the amount of UNSAFE abortions then for increases the risks of death. And before you say “oh well it wasn’t safe before” then your wrong on that one again. Abortion is scientifically proven to be one of the safest procedures out there. I understand your beliefs, I’m a Christian myself but I also believe in science. And in this case it FAR out ways your delusional cries for something that will never go away.

There is nothing about this trailer that will draw those who need to see it most to the viewings, it is only going to appeal to those of us who already know how horrible abortion is. And putting ""from the producer/director of God's Not Dead"" is definitely a turn off for unbelievers and pro-abortionists who need to see the movie. It is a turn off for me as well. I did not like that movie, I found it pretentious and the characters could have been done so much better. Leave who made this movie out of the trailer next time,  emphasize who the woman (the main character of this movie) is, that this is her real life story. That everything they said and did and saw is factual. As it is, the trailer makes me think this movie is nothing more than a Christian twist on a LifeTime TV movie. I want this movie to succeed. I want the truth to be out there. But this trailer came across as more grandstanding for the movie maker (who seems proud of a movie they made that I am sure turned no one to Christ and was only liked by some Christians) than a missionary work to bring people to Christ through the truth, and to show the horrors of what Planned Parenthood believes and does every day. Not stating that this story is real in the trailer has just given many pro abortionists ammunition to say, ""They are just dramatizing Planned Parenthood! You are just religious freaks who think a clump of cells can feel pain.""

(Because most families who doesn't have access to birth control end up having a lot of children yet unable to provide for all of them, which results in poverty). Elective abortion without any underlying medical condition is considered illegal, in which the anyone willingly involved in the abortion is punishable by law. To be honest, as a doctor myself, I don't understand how in people's comments doctors refused to give patients access to birth control (especially the permanent ones such as vasectomy or tubectomy) for the reason that ""you might change your mind later""? Like, there's this thing called informed consent, which is a signed statement that the patient has given their consent for a certain procedure to be done to them, & that the consent was given *after* they were being informed about that particular procedure (the objective, what is done, the risk & benefits, etc). This absolves the physician from risk of lawsuit in case the patient does change their mind. This is definitely should be an option, instead of legalizing elective abortion. Planned parenthood should comprise preventing unwanted pregnancy, planning how many children you want to have, how many years apart between siblings, what should be done when you want to stop having more children & a support system how to survive an unplanned pregnancy without any harm not only to both the mother & the baby, but also the family.",0,0,Yudhityas Paramita,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.17154761904761903,2019-02-17 17:59:52,True,True

2019-02-18T17:09:59,"Thought experiment, if abortion continues to be legal, by all means do it, but I would like it to be illegal to declare the baby not alive in the moment of conception, and I would like pro abortion define abortion as ending the baby's LIFE, what ever the mother reason is, valid or not valid. Remove all pursuit and campaign of answering the question whether the baby is a living being or not, but continue to legalize abortion. That way, no dishonor to the baby's life, no dishonor to the mother. Fair right? I do wonder what will happen hypothetically if that is to be implemented in real life.  Personally, I think in some situations and countries, it is a necessary evil like war. Murder is evil. A soldier defending a country and killing their enemies is ending a life, its still under the umbrella of evil perhaps a lesser one than murdering someone out of vengeance or hate, but it was necessary to win the war. Legalizing abortion is not condoning whats right, but as a dam of damage control. Because if its not legal, women will try to get it in more dangerous ways. Does it make it right? Not for me. Is it glorious? No. Worthy of praise? No. Practical and necessary? Yes. I don't believe all things legal equate to moral. So its not so much the act of abortion that enrages me, its the denying the baby is a living thing. My point is, some necessary things require dirtying your hands, and trying to deny the dirt and erasing it is disingenuous. So...abort the baby, but please acknowledge its life.  By the way, I am Christian and I do believe because this world is broken by sin. The analogy is like this. The world is threatened to be swallowed by a giant wave (sin/death/evil). Legalizing abortion is the dam that keeps the damage of the wave at bay (because without Christ the next best guardian is the law), but the wave is still there. A woman is raped, the rapist sins against her. The woman is pregnant, chooses to abort the baby, that is also sin because it ends life, but maybe her intentions are not evil, but both rapist, woman and baby are affected by sin. But the believer's hope is that wave...no longer have power over them, which is why ideally, believers given the choice, would not choose abortion, because they have a different law in their heart. Woman gets raped, rapist sins against her. Woman relies on the power of Jesus to not abort the child, cycle of sin is broken.  Well, in an ideal world, no one aborts the baby, because means to take care of the baby, to raise them to healthy happy adults are always in reach. But the world is far from ideal, some laws are necessary, because the means are not always in reach. But for those whose hope is in Christ, I pray they would not make that choice, I pray they put their faith that God provides and that God is the shepherd of their life.",2,0,A.Krishna,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.08509070294784578,2019-02-18 17:09:59,True,True

I don't care if people scoff because this movie is making its intent loud and clear because this country has been murdering babies in the womb for decades and painting it as ""reproductive health care"" and a ""woman's choice"" as buzzwords to hide the fact that it's a life made in the image of God.  We are fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14) and children are a heritage of the Lord (Psalm 127:3).  The Creator God that created all things (Genesis 1:1) and who gives eternal life in Jesus Christ (John 3:16) is not pleased with the murderous intent of unborn children in this country.  This move needs to be seen (regardless if they take a few liberties or not) because Planned Parenthood has been trying to cover up their wickedness for much too long.   (On a side note, the whole foundation of Planned Parenthood was started by Margaret Sanger, a woman who promoted Eugenics.  This is the practice of selective breeding-basically wiping out children you find undesirable.  Sanger was against any children that she deemed ""feeble-minded,"" as well as any children of color.  This practice was really promoted by Francis Galton, Charles Darwin's cousin, who took Darwin's evolutionary writings to the next level; if there was survival of the fittest, then it was only ""right"" to breed out those that weren't ""fit.""  This is the reason most abortion clinics are in minority and low-income areas, to follow Sanger's original plan.  According to statistics, there have been more African-American deaths by abortion than from urban crime, diseases, and accidents in the last three decades.  Ungodly ideas have consequences.  When you start out thinking that man isn't made in God's image and is just a random chance product of evolution, then you naturally have no problem killing those that you find undesirable.

And then that same baby was born 10 weeks early fighting for her life. I saw her humanity. I saw what an incredible little fighter she was. The things i felt about her when she was inside, are all true on the outside. You can get to know your little ones while they are in there, and those personalities just explode once born. My husband and I went through infertility struggles to even conceive our first child with a miscarriage in there. But I still think of that little baby we lost every day.

2019-02-28T13:15:38,"I have always been pro-choice, and I still am for abortions performed in the first trimester.  Arguments that life begins at conception don't work for me; that is my ""religious"" belief, but for you to understand how I know a 3 mo. old embryo isn't ensouled, you'd have to be dead. (It's a spiritual plane thing.)  In fact, abortion is a religious issue because the whole question involves the point at which ensoulment occurs, not when a heartbeat starts, or brain activity.  Any embryo has that whether mammal or reptile, and humans don't consider any of them ensouled. For that reason, government needs to keep hands off; separation of church and state.  HOWEVER, abortion at any point beyond 12 weeks (and maybe even 8 weeks) is unacceptable, as the question of when ensoulment happens must be considered possible once a certain level of fetal development is reached.  Not only is late-term abortion out of the question, but post-delivery!  The only times when post-delivery death is advisable is extreme birth defects (infants have been born without faces, brains, unrecognizable human bodies) or genetic diseases/conditions that are not only incurable, but mean a limited lifespan in excruciating pain.

Apart from its timely message, this is actually kind of a beautiful movie in its own right.  I don't generally cry at movies, but the final scene of this one brought me, as a parent, (pretty close) to tears - bittersweet tears.  The movie does not shy away from some of the less savory demonstrations that attach to the pro-life cause; it is credible.  But it pays particular attention to the quiet, patient, untiring, and ultimately successful vigil sustained by 40 Days For Life outside Abby Johnson's Planned Parenthood clinic.  Unlike some pro-life presentations, this film carefully, perhaps reverently avoids much in the way of graphic depiction.  Its most shocking scene is extraordinarily brief -- and a real gut punch.  But this and its few other graphic scenes are not gratuitous; each serves to illustrate carefully an important point about the reality of Planned Parenthood's gruesome practices.  Unplanned surely sharpened my outrage at the duplicity, the horror of Planned Parenthood's tactics and strategies.  But in the end it points towards healing, hope, love.  I urge all who wish to educate themselves further about the power of choice – the choice Abby Johnson made and has courageously pursued – to go see this movie in a theater near or even far from you, and bring as many friends and compatriots as you can.",0,0,Brian Flanagan,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.14296218487394952,2019-03-01 02:55:05,True,True

Fact- only 1% of all abortions, are done to save the mother. Fact-100% of all abortions are lethal. Fact- you don't have to be religious to abhor abortion. Fact- women's right's have become a euphemism for abortion rights. Fact- too many abortion's are clearly happening because women have become sloppy at taking care of their bodies, too immature to be doing an adult thing(for procreation)and just not responsible. Fact-women are routinely and casually using abortion as birth control.  .5% is due to rape 3% fetal health problems 4% education or career 4% physical health problems 7% not mature enough 8% don't want single motherhood  19% done having children  23% can't afford a baby 25% not ready for a child 6% other ------------------------------------------------------ .001% incestuous  .065% woman's life in danger .085% rape .288% physical health .666% fetal abnormality  6.268% social or economic reason 92.330% no reason ( elective) The abortion movement is propped up with junk science and misleading terms like pro choice. A human fetus is a human baby, it is a human organism. It's not just a blob of tissue, it is unique, and even if humankind were to persist for billions of years, there would never be another one just like the babies murdered every day. If anyone says it's needed to prevent overpopulation,  wrong, the current birthrate in America is 1.9, well below the replacement rate, which is 2.1 per child bearing mother. To keep our population steady, the birthrate would need to be 2.1 or higher.( when you can fit the entire population of earth inside the state of texas).I'll  get hate for this, but at this point I have no fucks to give. Rapists and pedophiles don't get the death penalty, it's considered cruel and unusual punishment,  so why must unborn babies be given the death penalty for the sins of their fathers. And saying abortion prevents poverty is horrendous, and if you follow this line to the end, what's to say that the elderly or sick won't be next? If you want to prevent pregnancy keep your legs closed or use birth control, spermicide and condoms in conjunction. Quit murdering babies as a form of birth control,that's not what it's meant for.",2,1,D. D.,gBLWpKbC3ww,-0.041071428571428585,2019-03-03 02:19:48,True,True

When I woke up I was told I was pregnant. Before all of this I was a virgin. I was having nightmares and all I wanted was to not remember that day. I asked the nurse what my options were.  She said that I could keep the baby, but with that come the fact that HIS/HER FATHER has rights to his child. So the man who caused me so much pain and took away my sense of security has rights! I did not want to deal with that, he was a violent man and to this day i am still scared of him. The next one was adoption. she did say i would have to have the father give up his rights as well. She told me I could say i did not know who the father was but if it ever came out there could be some serious problems later on. The last option is abortion. I chose to put my child up for adoption. Luckly for me the judge in my case took away all of the mans rights to his child. But other women are not so lucky. so please tell me what are they supposed to do?

So while I always get asked the question of “what about rape and incest?” I get annoyed that they try to justify the vast majority of killings by using situations that are way less than 1% of baby killings.  Let’s be honest here, a huge majority of baby killings are done because the sex was chosen but the pregnancy was not wanted.  Most of the women who chose to kill their babies just wanted the sex but didn’t want the pregnancy because it would be too much of a burden.  That’s the truth of the matter, and out of 1000 killings, 999 are done to relive the burden.  The other one is done because rape, incest, and other situations like medical complications or danger to the mother’s health.  But the law allows for it, so there’s no issue of not being able to do it, so be honest and just admit it’s killing babies, not a lump of cells.  Heck we all are huge lumps of cells.

Johnson had helped Kaminczak get a job at the Bryan Planned Parenthood clinic. Later, when Kaminczak left her husband, she’d slept on Johnson’s couch.  According to Kaminczak, who talked to her friend regularly last fall, Johnson quit Planned Parenthood for entirely nonreligious reasons. Kaminczak said Johnson’s reasons boiled down to workplace drama. Kaminczak had been promoted to assistant director at another clinic, she said, and she and Johnson had kept up via e-mail. Those e-mails contained graphic talk about Kaminczak’s sex life, as well as “inappropriate discussion” of their respective employees. One of Kaminczak’s “problem employees” saw the messages on her boss’s computer and, when Kaminczak pushed for her to be fired, complained to regional supervisors.  Kaminczak wouldn’t be more specific about what was in the e-mails, but she said that it was bad. When Planned Parenthood read the exchanges, she was fired for “inappropriate use of work e-mail.” Johnson was placed on a “performance improvement plan,” which meant she had to meet with Diane Santos, the regional director, every week “to discuss her performance.”  “So Abby was feeling really pressured, and everyone was treating her differently,” Kaminczak said. “She was so pissed. She felt like she’d given them everything, and this was just a slap in the face.”  That, Kaminczak said, is why Johnson resigned.  “I talked to her right after she saw that abortion,” Kaminczak said. “She was super-excited about it—she said it seemed a lot more humane then the normal procedure, like the patient was in a lot less pain.”  She wasn’t bothered at all?  “I mean, I asked her that,” Kaminczak said. “She said no. And I asked her if people at the clinic were going to be OK with it, and she said, ‘Well, if we hire this doctor, and this is how he does things, I guess they’re going to have to be.'”  Kaminczak’s story might help explain the three-week gap between Johnson’s leaving Planned Parenthood and her coming out for the coalition. “She called me two weeks before this whole thing broke,” Kaminczak said, “and she told me she was thinking about going to the coalition. She had been having serious money problems—she’d been talking about bankruptcy—and she told me that Shawn [Carney] had promised her $3,000 speaking gigs if she came over.”",0,0,dsimpki,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.0578907203907204,2019-03-05 23:08:00,True,True

Look up ""abortion"" and ""miscarriage"" in any dictionary. A miscarriage is an abortion. What doctors (and parents) do to infants in the womb is infanticide. Had Roe v. Wade been waged over infanticide rather than abortion, it would have never made it to the court room. In fact, by employing the word ""abortion,"" Roe v. Wade was won before it ever got to court.  The Greek word ""brephos"" employed in the New Testament for infants already born is the same word used for infants in the womb  (Luke 2:12 and Luke 1:41), without specifying the precise moment they became a ""brephos."" Therefore, our only option is to then accept that they became such at conception. Thus, intentionally killing a brephos at any point is ""brephocide"" or, more properly, infanticide.  The same is true regarding the Old Testament Hebrew word translated ""child.""  The point being, we Christians need to stop using the non-Christians' watered-down, politically correct terms such as ""abortion"" and ""gay."" It's infanticide and sodomy. There is no power in the former terms against evil and our first mistake is in acquiescing to the ungodly's terminology.

If someone was holding a tank of 100 embryos and a live, human baby over a cliff, and they said you had to choose which one was dropped, which would you pick? The baby. Because a chunk of cells isn’t alive. Can you remember when you were a newborn? no? so imagine months before that. It’s a choice. Also, if someone was dying and needed a kidney, you can’t force anyone to give up a kidney. even if the person is dead. because the person has total control over their body. which means forcing a woman to carry a baby gives her less body autonomy than a corpse. Thirdly, even if it was outlawed, do you think for a second that there would be no abortions? no. Abortion isn’t murder.

2019-03-22T07:29:33,"Even before I was an atheist (i'm mentioning this because it a pureflix film, so its got to have some christian shit in it), i never fully agreed with being against pro-life. I understand the reasoning behind the Pro-life agruement (hell its been shoved down my throat since the conversation got started), but I don't agree and I think that this movie will make it hard for children in a christian household fell like they don't have a choice. You can argue that the 'baby' or 'fetus' has not choice, but think of it this way:   I get pregnant and know I am not in a place in my life to have a child (the reason doesn't matter. it is mine and that's what matters). I look into adoption and see that the United States foster system already has thousands of children who are not adopted and more than likely not be. It is a slim chance that a few month old will be adopted and after four years, the chance goes down even more. What do I do?  I would never have a late term abortion--unless it was a true medical emergency. Call me selfish. I am. I am twenty years old and I don't know if I want to have natural children anyway. Don't take away my option to make another child's life good when I'm ready. (Also, for those of you who see this and say I shouldn't have sex, okay. at this point in my life I have not had sex yet. That argument doesn't work for me at the moment. Also, you can be abstinent and still become pregnant. I know that it is rare, but there is still a chance.) Also, Planned Parenthood does so much more than just abortions. It give free birth control to women who couldn't otherwise afford it. It does screenings and so much more. If movies like this are done, we need to look at everything. Lastly, Pureflix, why is this rated R? If you want a message to get out to people, don't limit your audience.

2019-03-22T13:56:00,"I know this is a long comment, but for those of you that will listen. I hope that this may provide you clarity as to the views of pro choice women and people. =Edited for easier reading=  Planned Parenthood is an organization that, yes, provides abortion procedures to those the need or want it, but they also provide low cost if not free birth control, condoms, and sex education among other things like sti/std medication and annual exams. Honestly I'm not a sexually active person, but I'm grateful of the services they provide for their community.   Having a baby could seriously interfere with their education, work, or finances if they could not afford a baby at the time. If they already have kids it could make it harder to care for the children they already have. I know that for many young people in high school and college, having a baby recklessly could ruin their chances at pursuing their education, if not completing a high school education. It's a similar complication for people that work even a nice salary job, not planning when you have a child meticulously could ruin your life. For some women they want a child and they have everything going and disaster strikes.   Late term abortions are not some random decision like, 'oh i wanted this baby, but now i don't, oh well, let's pop it out and toss it in the can 😏' Late term abortions typically have to happen, because either the child is already dead in the womb, the child is killing the mother, or the child has congenital defect that will kill the child shortly after birth. It is a genuine life or death decision. To know that as much as 61% of the women that get abortions are already mothers they have their children, this one was not planned for or is unable to be had, but in the future they may want anouther. Think of it like this, a woman has a pregnancy that she in unable to handle for one reason or anouther it will kill her, the child could live and not have a mother and become a ward of the state, or she gets the abortion and lives to see her family again, to later have a successful pregnancy down the road.   I know of a young woman that was a mother in a very Christian community that had been (if i remember the details correctly she had 2 kids already and wanted a 3rd with her husband) with child and she had gone to her doctor and he told her that it was not viable for her to go to term and it would cost her life, well she was thinking of getting an abortion and trying again. However because the community was so closeknit they all found out and they shamed her into not getting the abortion and going to term. She ended up dying with the child. They called her brave and that she was gone too soon. She left two children and a husband, she left her entire family because of the shame people put on this woman for wanting to protect her own life.  I wish I could take this woman's account at face value, and taking it as such, the doctor that botched her abortion this badly should have been sued for medical malpractice and emotional labours they caused this woman if this were what happened. Coworkers of hers were genuinely concerned this woman may have stolen medical records, building entrance codes, or co-workers’ resumes and that she may have given them, along with doctors’ names and security precautions, to her new allies, who often seek such information. She was the director of a Planned Parenthood, there is no way she got her position without having seen an ultrasound guided abortion. There are bills being presented that want to criminalize and possibly offer the death penalty for having an abortion.  I've always been someone that wants to let people choose thier own lives, wanna be gay? Do it. Wanna be straight? Do it. Wanna end up in jail? I recommend against it, but sure do it. You can't control what other people do.

Making abortion illegal will not stop the women, just kill thousands that will go to some underground doctor and have abortion performed in dangerous conditions. Women are programmed to want children and when they get pregnant, that goes into overdrive. And no one will love this child more than his mother.

At least, it's not for us to interfere.   The best thing to do right now, is to advance science to the point, when women that don't want the child, can have the  embryo extracted and put in artificial womb to gestate and later adopted.

That's not your fetus, you're not carrying it, and you are not the one who has to experience the after effects of pregnancy.    If you actually considered the child or the mother you wouldn't be forcing the mother to carry the child to term. It's immoral. The mother is the most important part of the process yet you clearly don't care about her at all. Abolishing abortion will just lead to black market abortion, possible suicide, possible depression, but will definitely lead to a stressful pregnancy and more likely than not lots of complications.    I've actually known someone who was an unwanted child and they said they'd rather have been aborted because she was neglected and abused. It doesn't matter what your intentions are if it ends up being bad anyway. You don't know what will become of that child.

2019-03-24T23:09:00,"This is the dumbest fucking shit I have ever seen.   How dare you ""pro-life"" idiots prioritize a fetus in the womb over a BREATHING, LIVING woman. Most of these women that have these procedures are teenagers, rape victims, or are not financially stable enough to provide for a child and KNOW this. Would you rather a child go hungry because their mothers couldn't provide for them? Or live their lives in adoption centers, which, by the way, still contain over a million unadopted kids? Not to mention that the ban on LGBT couples adopting children still holds strong thanks to you heartless lot. They do NOT have abortions into the third term--and that NY bill that you all are foaming at the mouths over is only if the woman's LIFE IS IN DANGER. Abortion is NOT some happy go-lucky thing that a woman wakes up and just decides. It's a grueling process that costs time, money, and emotional strain due to idiots like you screaming at them outside of Planned Parenthood about how they're all ""murderers."" Guess what? Planned Parenthood isn't the ""Only Abortions Here!"" clinic. It's called PLANNED PARENTHOOD for a reason. Most women who go into the clinic do so for pregnancy testing, STD testing, birth control (they may take it to prevent painful periods, conditions, or endometriosis), gynecological check-ups, and FAMILY. PLANNING. I was in Catholic school for over twelve years and was taught nothing but lies about abortion and the statistics behind teenage pregnancy in favor of ""God's values."" Girls are not these ""sluts"" you see them as that have premarital sex for funsies and abortions for ""convenience"" because they want to, over and over again. Abortion is something that takes a woman a LONG ASS TIME to decide, because it is money-draining, and she will be faced with you idiots yelling at her outside the gates. If your Catholic schools would teach about safe sex for teenagers that are most likely going to engage in sexual behavior, there wouldn't BE a need for these teenagers to have abortions due to unsafe sex and the inability to gain access to birth control, condoms, etc. Abstinence does not work out in the realm of teenagers whose entire lives have been focused on ""don't do this,"" because as we all know, the more you tell a child not to do something, the more they. will. do it. Would you rather them have safe sex without the consequences of pregnancy LEADING to abortion, or would you rather them get pregnant and deal with the aftermath in shambles with their lives ruined? Teenage pregnancy does not ruin lives so long as you make safety a priority. This isn't some ""pay the consequence"" bullshit, because a CHILD is not a ""consequence,"" and I hope some of you can at least agree with THAT.  Half of you probably listen to false information via Trump about illegal immigrants, who allows kids detained in ICE to be sexually assaulted. You don't care about THOSE children when you're rallying for their parents to be deported. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/26/thousands-migrant-children-report-sexual-assaults-us-custody-border-detain/2988884002/ https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/while-in-ice-custody-thousands-of-migrants-reported-sexual-abuse  You ""Christian"" parents don't give a damn about YOUR children, either, when they come out as LGBT. You either kick them out and disown them, or place them more at risk for suicide/depression with your ""religious"" rhetoric. What happened to ""love thy neighbor?"" Oh, right. You all just cherry-pick the Bible's phrasing of ""no man shall lie with another man,"" which was actually deeply lost in translation over time and originally was put into context of pedophilia.  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj57Li-7pvhAhVOLK0KHUzqCt0QFjABegQIABAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Flesley.edu%2Farticle%2Fthe-cost-of-coming-out-lgbt-youth-homelessness&usg=AOvVaw2AqP7Xdoc01YWG7q7NQ6UK  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/  Seems like you don't give a shit about ""life"" when it's outside of the womb.

Now we try to make it prettier and more noble by calling it ""pro choice."" At least we were honest in the 70's. My heart and attitude were changed by God as He convicted me of my need for a Savior and then reoriented my life in a way that reflected His heart and not mine. I did go through an adoption with our first grandchild. Thankfully, I protested lovingly with our children in support of life against a local obstetrician who was doing more abortions than delivering live babies in the 1980's. When a family member became pregnant and even considered abortion(suggested by boyfriend), her siblings reminded her of what they were taught as children ref the taking of a baby's life. And that family member took that to heart, and went through excruciating emotional pain in a choice to carry her baby to term, admit she was not mature enough or in a place to provide for a child, and lovingly let go of her son to someone who was incapable of having children. Letting go of one's child to be raised by another is exceedingly hard,  but I would say allowing one's child to be killed is not only hard but destructive to one's heart and soul.

This is obviously 110% bullshit. The vast majority of abortions are done in the 1st trimester and only include taking pills and mild suction. Removal of the fetus via c-section is not a plausible situation to happen in an abortion clinic. And even if it was the fetus would not have been struggling or fucking crying because it is just a bundle of cells that cannot survive outside the womb.

2019-03-27T05:43:09,"For fuck's sake, how do these stupid movies keep getting made? The 'God's Not Dead' people made a shitton of money with their religious propaganda and now they can't seem to fucking stop.  None of you idiots posting are Pro-Life; You are Pro-Birth. You see women as nothing but incubators, and believe that the act of sex should be punished by forcing them to have children that they do not want.  ""Oh, but you can give it up for adoption!"" Do you know what the adoption facilities are like? How hard they make it for people to actually adopt kids? How many kids are stuck there until they grow out of the system because people only want newborn babies and not the literal thousands of older children who have been stuck there for years? Not to mention how horrible they are to LGBT couples who try to adopt.   ""New York's law says you can kill a baby right before it's born!"" Yeah, if it's going to either die anyway, or if it being born (Vaginally OR C-Section) has a high risk of killing the mother. No abortion done after the 20-week mark is done just because the mother doesn't want it; how about you do some actual research, hm?  There's a lovely idiot down in the comments who made this inquiry: "" Isn't it more of a tragedy when a child dies rather than an adult because the child never really got to experience life and all it has to offer? (College, marriage, etc) What makes pregnancy any different?"" Yes, it's a horrible tragedy that child never got to experience a lifetime of monetary debt and the weight of societies expectations of you, of course, why didn't we think of that! Really, that's the examples you chose? OF COURSE it's horrible when a CHILD dies, but not a goddamn clump of cells. A Heartbeat is not a Brain, so it's STILL not a child even if it has a heartbeat.  Abortions are expensive, and the percentage of people who do them just because they can are ridiculously low, like 0.001% low. Women who get them do it because either their birth control failed (another thing you psycho pro-birthers keep trying to make harder to get, because god-forbid a woman wants to have sex with her partner and NOT get pregnant, but that's just blasphemy to you nutjobs, isn't it?), they are not mentally/physically/financially stable enough to have a child, or they have done the tests available to check for certain conditions, such as Downs, and chosen to terminate so the child won't have such a rough quality of life, which would also be a drain in many ways on their parents. (Obviously I have nothing against any person who has any type of disability, but life is rough enough without them, and I feel bad for them knowing that the majority of them will never live a full life due to having to be dependent on someone forever, not to mention the parents who have to care for them for the rest of their lives as well) Then of course there's your cases of rape, and if any of you thinks a woman, or a young girl should be forced to carry and deliver her rapists child, and think you're going to heaven? Like the 11-year-old girl who couldn't get an abortion because of bullshit in her country, just look up '11 year old gives birth"". Do you think this is okay? Do you really really think that getting an abortion would've been WORSE than an actual living feeling thinking CHILD carrying and birthing her rapists child?   Abortion should be easily accessed for those who need it, and honestly for those who want it, because we women should not be punished for having sex. Men are seen as great heroes to other men when they fuck multiple women, but a woman who has more than one partner is seen as a whore or a slut. It's disgusting.  There are billions of human beings on this planet; We are currently in no danger of becoming extinct (unless we kill each other via war, but that's another topic) We do not need to worry about consistently procreating, whether or not that is our basic function, we have supposedly grown and evolved past that point.  You will never change my mind, I will always be Pro-Choice. I support your choice not to get an abortion, to keep your child, to give your child up for adoption, whatever, but I also support HER choice to abort her pregnancy, to not give up her life and dreams just to kneel to society's idea of what a woman should be doing.  I don't want kids. I don't want to bring a kid into this world that is steadily going to hell-in-a-handbasket, I don't want to pass on my medical/mental problems, and I don't want to give up my life, my time and my distant dreams to raise a kid that I would forever hold resentment for.  No child should be born to someone who would resent them, and the majority of people who get abortions know that they would feel that way. It's not wrong to not want kids, to not like kids, and to know yourself enough to know that having kids will not be good for you. I'm okay with people thinking that I'm selfish for not wanting kids, because I don't give a damn what you think. It's MY life, not yours. You don't get to tell me what to do with it.   By the way: What the FUCK happened to separation of Church and State? Because it seems to me that Religion is having way too big of a hand in lawmaking right now, and needs to fuck right off. You have your freedom of religion, but when your Religion steps on the freedom of others, that's not right. Not everyone subscribes to your Sky Daddy, and this is not a Christian Nation no matter what you loonatics would like to believe. You have your right to practice whatever religion you want, but I have the right to not practice a religion at all, which I don't.   Keep Religion out of Politics.

When I was 18 till 19, I suffered thru seizures and  NO doctor had a clue as to why! They told me I drank too much (weekends. 2-3 six-packs between 3-5 friends, when I didn’t hafta work the next day, since I had my own place) I was told I must be on drugs. I was even told they weren’t seizures at all. Then, the ambulance calls to my job to get me n take me to hospital cuz I’d passed out and seizing at work. This went on till I lost my job because they had no idea what was going on but couldn’t take the chance I’d pass out into the fryer or something. Even my mother ;we’ll get into her later) said I MUST be on drugs cuz there was nothing wrong with me (tho she wasn’t a doctor, nurse or anything of the like) Finally, one doc took my seizures seriously. I was admitted to the hospital (which shudda been done ALL the other times) with a blood sugar level of 17! Meanwhile, I had to have an abortion because the doctors all said the baby and I would both die. They’d no clue why I was seizing but couldn’t give me ANYTHING to try and stop the seizures. So, in I went. I didn’t even know I was pregnant. But, I went ahead with the procedure after taking to my guy n his family. Months later, they decided to admit me and test. THEN they found, after a painful angiogram (they’re not only for the heart) I had an insulinoma. It’s pretty rare. I had surgery to remove 1/3 of my pancreas and not a prob since. Had I not been ABLE to have the abortion, my 4 beautiful children wouldn’t have ever been born. Neither would my 2 precious grandchildren. As for my mother?

She didn’t bother to even flush the fetus. I don’t know how far along she was or at what stage the fetus was at all I know if that when I came into the bathroom right after her I saw it and felt awful. I saw it in the trash can or toilet and just remembered...that...that human and that doesn’t belong there. So I put it in a tiny container with a paper tissue on top. My mom came home and saw. It was awful that she was forced to go through that and I was forced to see it and still have no idea what was happening. The second time was done at planned parenthood I believe. We just were way too poor to have a another mouth to feed the poor thing would’ve been miserable just living it was to. My sister still was only 13.... then at the age of 14 my sister decided to keep her third one, because she finally decided that she didn’t want anymore to kill? No because she wanted the father to stay and was trying to force him to with a that baby. He didn’t not even for a second. I mean don’t get me wrong she loves the baby even through we were still pretty poor at the time we gave everything we could. And because of these things I’ve witnessed I just could never do an abortion and I’m not really Christian much like my family. It’s just emotionally I couldn’t handle not knowing that I killed something most people would also kill to have or that I’m lucky to even be able to make one. But that’s also why I’m able to see the other side of the story I’m not too blinded by a religion that says it wrong that I can see both sides. Most of the time the cost of a baby is not available for young teen moms and neither their family. And putting the poor child in the foster care where it might never have the chance there either is more devastating. So it either give the child away, kill it, or have it and more than likely have it still stuffer. All three option don’t look good at the time to some. And maybe that’s why choose abortion cause it seems more of a stable one and done thing that they can forget, but they don’t. They give you a picture of a baby to see always.... that can never be forgotten. Instead of worrying for years if you did the right thing not knowing if the baby got the loving home it deserved or even with you that the baby is happy and loved. I just don’t think personally I ever could do it. But these might be the reason or can...or have to. So please don’t blame them cause of your religion, cause not everyone has the time to see it through your religions eyes, nor will.

Those people need to not be parents. If your response to have a gay kid is forcing them to change through conversion camp or abandoning them, don't have a family and abort every pregnancy. Some people say adoption is an option. It is, but if those kids don't get adopted, they grow up in the system. Not to mention they  can feel unwanted by their parents and their society. Imagine going to an adoption fair. You are judging every kid you pass by snd they know it. They know when you quickly pass them, you have said ""no"" to them. Imagine what a kid has to do with that rejection. I know some of you say that killing a fetus is wrong, but so is killing a child. And, every time this country has gone to war, we have killed families with kids who have nothing to do with whatever reason we are at war with the country.

While that is the procedure the company thrives on, it also teaches about safe sex and CONTRACEPTION. Two VERY important and positive things. In general, it provides help and healthcare in areas different than pregnancy termination. Getting rid of planned parenthood would not just get rid of abortions, but all those other extremely helpful women’s healthcare resources.

I live in Indiana. planned parenthood was shut down in a number of counties surrounding us and not only did we have a Chlamydia outbreak but also a resurgence in HIV and STI patients. Many women (and men) that did not have the most stable income were forced to drive HOURS to get cancer screenings , mammograms, pregnancy ultrasounds, and many other services for cheaper health care costs.

I personally would never, ever chose to get an abortion, even in the worst of possibilities, but I don’t think there should be any obstruction towards women in the early stages of pregnancy to receive an abortion if they believe that option is what is best for them. Whether a baby would ruin their plan for life, the baby was conceived from rape, a result of incest, etc. And I whole-heartedly believe abortion should not be questioned when the mother’s life is at stake. However, this movie really does point out a big issue with Planned Parenthood, and I can be grateful for that. Although Planned Parenthood isn’t quite the devil that this trailer hyped it up to be, they sometimes can lead women to believe an abortion is their only option in one of the most vulnerable times in their lives. If anything, I am glad this trailer will raise awareness of that and spark change. But Planned Parenthood does so many other wonderful things for women’s health! Please stop protesting against the organization as a whole if you are a pro-life individual, as they provide many life-saving and useful services such as cancer screenings, STD testing and treatment, infertility services, and so much more!

It's always an awe inspiring thing to be a part of.  What has moved me into the pro-life guy I am today is not just the experiences but also the behavior of those who advocate abortion. I find them to be often very callous and uncomfortably cavalier in their attitude towards ending a human life. I honestly think some of these people, like the cartoonish super villain Kermit Gosnell, actually ENJOY performing abortions. But at the end of the day, all you have to do is follow the money.

All done for no reason except to prevent as many people as possible from seeing it. Why is that? What are they afraid of?

One of the great things about the movie is that it is not about ranting and raving (there is only one hateful pro-life person in the movie, whose technique is rejected by the larger 40 Days for Life group whose goal is to love and support the women getting abortions as well as to form bonds with the workers to help change their minds and hearts.)  I think the trailer will turn off any pro-choice person that is considering going and that is a shame.  The movie has considerable value to educate Christians about the true nature of Planned Parenthood, but it would be even more wonderful to have pro-choice people see it.  With the one exception I mentioned (to acknowledge that they exist), there is no hysteria in the movie, just a lot of patience in the people who for the love of God and human beings are working to turn our nation away from abortion.  The movie tells the truth but does not attack people.   A great script, high production values, good acting, character development and deep insight.  Telling a true story with respect and love for the people--both victims and those who support abortion without really understanding it.",12,1,vogsNM,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.2520164609053498,2019-03-31 03:08:25,False,True

The Psychologists always start with 'So What do you hope to get out of this session today' and after the girls and women say what they hope for about having a Baby, the Psychologists ignore what they say and launch straight into negative aspects of having a baby - these FREE Family Planning and FREE Planned Parenthood sessions are a TRAP and 100% of women and girls attending these FREE SESSIONS went their with the intentions of HAVING their BABY!! I suspect that over 50% of Girls and Women, fall into trap of then being bullied by their partner not tot have the child due to the fact that these Psychologists direct the negative speak about financial strain and the guy has rights to say no and you have your future ahead of you towards the male in the room. I would say around 25% of girls and women do not realise they have simply been programmed into doubting themselves, and thinking negative thoughts about having their child, and once they are bullied by their partners, they fall into the trap of attending the appointment out of desperation for not being bullied anymore and due to the programming the Psychologists did to them while they were in those FAKE Family Planning and Fake Planned Parenthood sessions. After the girls and women arrive at what the Planned Parenthood & Family Planning buildings that have no signage and are hidden from main roads, they are quickly ushered into the room in which they are anesthetized, so that they don't have time to 'Blackout' or change their minds - when these Women and Girls wake up in the after surgery room, there are usually upto 20-30 other women and girls in there - it is like a Production Factory - and all they hear when they wake up is 'SCREAMING & CRYING' and the sound of their own 'SCREAMS & CRIES' as they all realise what they were just manipulated into doing, and their is NOTHING but pain and suffering in the after Surgery rooms, with girls and women secretly consoling each other when their partners and the Psychologists are out of the room saying 'I was Bullied into having an Abortion' and others saying 'Me Too'!  - None of the young girls or women in the after surgery rooms actually wanted an ABORTION and as for these Women's Lib people who are directly related to the people who make money of the PILL, Condoms and Abortion Clinics, they were promoting MENS rights in the Planned Parenthood and Family Planning Clinics - hidden from the general public and knowing that the young girls and women would be too embarrassed to speak out about having an abortion and be too poor to take the clinics to court! This Movie is properganda created by Jewish people who are making money off poor girls and women by running chop shops, fake Planned Parenthood and Family Planning clinics, Fully funded by YOUR JEWISH governments who HATE non-JEWs and want to see your numbers dwindle, while they pop out 7-8 babies each, to slowly out number you all - WAKE UP people, stop turning a blind eye to this propaganda - The Jewish always use Anti-Christian properganda as a way to turn peoples attention away from what THEY are actually doing to you all - they are permitted to do anything to you to make money including manipulating you into having an abortion, selling illegal drugs to your children, selling your children alcohol, manipulating you into thinking your children are mentally ill, putting arsenic in the cattle feed that they then sell you as pink looking meat in their major Woollworths and Coles supermarkets in all their Shopping Centers like 'Westfields' which only houses Jewish run businesses - this is how they drew you all away from shopping at your local Non-Jewish shops and businesses!!

You could not just walk into a clinic and get it done if you had the money.  If it was not for the fact that a friend of hers told her that the doctor she had found to do the procedure would leave her bleeding on the table after the procedure I would have been one of those children in those blue barrels.  The shameful truth is that when my first ex-wife had gotten pregnant when we were dating I was now my father looking to kill my child.  There was no one there to save my child from me or my ex-wife.  I am a child murderer and every day that I live I REGRET my SELFISHNESS.  I regret that I was not strong enough to stand up for her right, to this day I do believe it was a little girl, to live as I do.  So no matter what this Molech worshiping organization says about ""the rights of the mother or woman"" you are STILL MURDERING A CHILD AND SACRIFICING THEM to YOUR LUST DEMON!  To YOUR MAN-MADE god.

And 2ndly, l myself do believe abortions are one of the most effective ways for occultists to draw the most innocent blood from unborn babes to get as much power as poss to continue to rule this world.....and perhaps help keep with population control.  Esp of the undesirables, blacks, Latino, poor ppl, etc. (which is where these clinics are located along with liquor stores and lottery tix shops) .    With that, what poss result do these psycho, stupid ass, unholy Christian bigots expect with their harassment of the mothers at 0:33 ?!?!      Perhaps they should intervene  WAAAAY BEFORE that stage!!  Hear of preventive measures much?!?!    What does the America church expect who did away with the institution of marriage and buries their head on whoring around, and who DISCOURAGES marriage??? (at least from my experience  in the black AND white Amer churches in  the DC area.)  One Northern Va. wanna be mega white/mixed church was SOOOOO SHALLOW, they ONLY acknowledged you if you were thin, fit, and looked like Barbie or Ken.  And if you were weird and geeky looking (like a tall, fit blond, nice but weird acting guy l knew) they only laughed at you.  How holy of a church is this?!?!  Unfortunately, the black church with 90% women (where MANY are unmarried), 90% feminine men, and the rest are deacons isn't much better  😠🤔🙄🙄🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️      the Amer church is a perfect recipe for abortion and satan.!!!  on the sly acceptance of whoring around, SHALLOW ass marriages, instant divorce, mass hatred, and the expected outcome of  abortions and murder.  I wonder how much influence does Satan even have in the weak Amer. church?    So to successfully prevent abortion.....TRY appreciating humans (flaws like yourself and all) and not just their money or looks.  and then try marring your OWN man or woman,  then perhaps try staying married for longer than 7 days.  and lastly, use a condom before hand.   basic common since which is never common anymore.   🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🙄🙄    Look up Alpha Pregnancy and pro-life org like that.  They don't go cursing out pregnant women trying to start a fight (or blow up) abortion clinics.  They reach the mom time she get's knocked up.   And research and visit some small, store front Afr church, Orthodox Jew temples, or perhaps the Hebrew Israelite or Mormons who  actually value marriage and family and actively  have in church match making programs for GROWING HUMANS WITH HARMONIES!!!      What possible positive outcome can any sane, logical, normal being expect to get when you're being yelled at and cursed out by demented, evil, Christians (like that nasty guy at   0:33), pro choice, or pro life fanatics.....except maybe slapped or cursed back out after being verbally attacked?!?

The crown of thorns entwined on CHRIST’s head,  streams of blood trickling down HIS face as he bled,  is the image of the curse of mankind's sinful deeds.  Barabbas (murderer) and all sinners are the wretched-guilty, CHRIST freed.  CHRIST took Barabbas' place on Calvary; CHRIST took our place.  Mankind's sinful judgment, our death sentence Christ faced!  The name ""Barabbas"" means son of ABBA, FATHER.  Through HIS death, HE bought all HIS adopted sons and daughters!    So  mankind, through repentance and acceptance of the gift of the redeeming (ransom) BLOOD, can become the adopted sons and daughters of our HEAVENLY FATHER!

2019-04-02T01:35:46,"A great review from Rotten Tomatoes audience critics: STEVEN F says, Better than we expected. LBH, ""Christian"" movies have a reputation for not being made to the highest production standards. Wooden acting. Saccharin or unlikely plots. Hysterical or overwrought drama.  So my wife and I were pleasantly surprised to see Unplanned this morning at a matinee, where our emotional and intellectual attraction was fully engaged throughout.  This is a well made movie that is honest about the complexities of abortion, and fair to nearly all parties involved.  Early on the movie demonstrates it is a serious, balanced and factual look at the very difficult issue of abortion when it brings us into the procedure room where the protagonist (actress Ashley Bratcher playing the real-life Abby Johnson) witnesses an actual abortion on the screen of an ultrasound for the first time.  Despite having worked her way up the ladder over 8 years in to the position of Director of her local Planned Parenthood clinic, she had never actually seen the procedure, even though she had chosen to abort her own pregnancies twice before.  Lying on one's back enduring a painful medical procedure with eyes closed apparently is not the same as watching an 8 week old baby on a sonogram monitor being probed with a vacuum tube that the baby struggles to evade only to ultimately be sucked away in a hose full of bloody tissue, an empty black hole on the sonogram screen being all that remains of the terminated pregnancy.  This experience in the operating room, witnessing a baby struggling to live only to be sucked into a bio waste container, changes Abby's life immediately. Call it her Red Pill moment. She flees the OR to a nearby closet where she cries uncontrollably.  The rest of the movie walks us through her slow transformation from a reluctant seeker of abortion services 8 years earlier as a college student, to her ascendancy to the Directorship of the same Planned Parenthood facility where her two abortions were facilitated.  We see the terror and shame experienced by the abortion clients as they exit their cars to a cacophony of screaming. well-meaning, but utterly failed abortion protesters holding angry signs with photos of aborted fetuses. And we see the much more effective, praying Christians softly reaching out to Abortionist and abortion seeking client alike, trying to get to know them, speaking in love, showing everyone the utmost respect.  My wife remarked that Abby was ""a slow learner"", as it takes a full 8 years for her to wake up to the truth of what an abortion is, despite that she is surrounded by family (husband, mother, father) who gently disagree with her participation in the abortion industry.  And what an industry it is, one billion dollars in revenue, supported culturally, financially and politically by some of the wealthiest and most influential people in the world.  I mentioned that almost everyone is treated fairly in this movie. I think the leadership of Planned Parenthood is consistently portrayed in a bad light, cold heartedly driving their staffs to double the number of abortions in order to raise PP's highest margin product - abortion - the ""fries and Coke"" of the Women's Health industry. There is very little affection or sympathy shown to the leadership of Planned Parenthood, so I guess one could say their portrayal was unfair. But nowhere was it nonfactual, lest this movie would have never been released. Given the enormous financial, cultural and political resources available to the litigious abortion industry it is not possible that any procedures or facts related to Planned Parenthood would have been allowed in to this movie without iron-clad vetting before hand.  The abortion industry does not want you to see this movie.  They sued Abby Johnson shortly after she quit Planned Parenthood in an attempt to shut her up.  They got this movie's official Twitter account banned on the weekend of its release as its follower count climbed to 7,000.  And I have read that the mainstream media (ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, NYTimes, etc) universally rejected the advertising monies offered to them by this movies producers.  But the days of MSM blackouts are over.  Remember that Twitter suspended the official Twitter account of this movie @UnPlannedMovie on its opening weekend as its follower count climbed to 7,000?  Well, as of this writing, that count is just shy of 300,000.  I urge every person who is not a 100% political partisan abortion advocate to see this movie. If you've ever wondered if the millions of women who have had abortions have regrets. If you've ever wondered if there are kind and prayerful people who understand the pain of weighing an abortion who want to offer any help they can. If you've ever wondered if the abortion procedure is not as painless and easy as Planned Parenthood says it is. You will benefit from seeing this movie.",1,0,sandman4224,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.027469405594405593,2019-04-02 01:35:46,False,True

She had the abortion. After... she was in shock. Her eyes wide. She couldn’t speak. I had no idea what abortion does to a woman’s health. Emotionally, mentally and yes, physically. Women continue to suffer long after the abortive act Is physically finished. Some for the rest of their lives. I reach out to others who believe that abortion is a woman’s health decision. It is not. It is a life altering decision, one that hurts, not helps. One that most post-abortive women regret. Keeping a child is also a life altering decision. One with challenges, yes.  But... you will never hear a woman say that they regretted keeping their child alive, that an abortion was something they wished they had done. I can’t change what I did to my sister.

2019-04-02T05:10:02,"Hi K K. I too had an abortion around the same time you did, and another 5 yrs earlier when I was 17. The guilt was so heavy, for over 30 year! It affected many parts of my life such as my health, addiction, relationships, my  finances, etc. K K, I asked for forgiveness but I could not forgive myself. That was a big part of my problem. I also was not ready to follow Jesus because I was too busy enjoying life on my own terms. When life got too tough to handle my way, I finally screamed out to God in prayer. (You don't have to scream though. God hears us when we whisper and when we pray quietly. he is looking for pure hearts, hearts that are seeking Him and seeking the truth of His love and His Word.)   I asked Jesus to help me, to forgive me, and to come into my life and change me from the inside out because I really needed Him. If you said a prayer like that to Jesus, then you are saved and you are forgiven of all your sins. This is what Jesus calls salvation, or being born again, or born of the Spirit. If you did that, you were given a new spirit and you are saved and forgiven. Also, at that moment the Holy Spirit, Jesus' spirit, comes to live inside of you. God communicates with your spirit through His Holy Spirit. If you haven't asked Jesus to come into your life, please try it. It is just a simple prayer like I mentioned above.   After that, you need to be fed spiritually. Just like our bodies need food, our spirit needs to be fed spiritually with the Word of God. In the bible God says, faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. Find a good church, a church that preaches and teaches the Word of God from the bible itself so you can learn how to follow Jesus. Ask God what church He wants you to attend.    Below is a bible verse from 1 John 1:9 that teaches us how God forgives us. It is the truth. God is faithful. He is a good, good God. He never lies. He loves you K K. It starts with asking Jesus to come into your life as mentioned above. Just pray to Him from your heart.   ""If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness"". (That is what God says about how He forgives us.)   I am praying for you now K K.

2019-04-03T00:11:07,"What if I said there is a difference between legalizing Abortion and someone else paying for it. What if it was legal but YOU had to pay as with any medical procedure. The battle is NOT really about life or babies but rather ACCESS and who pays for it. You see if those who support Planned Parenthood and Abortion knew that it would be legal, but that no federal money would be spent to grant access, then only private funds or charities could pay they'd be very upset since it is not the simple fact that it is legal, or providing 'services' but rather that it has a steady stream of income to provide the service and once provided what happens to the products such as organ or stem cells or whatever they do with the remains.   Meaning, it is a false argument to say the battle by the Pro Abortion side is keeping it legal. Imagine if that were the fact, but no federal money was spent to provide 'access', you'll see the true reasons come out then as to what they are really fighting for.   Cutting off federal spending and forcing Planned Parenthood to be the business it is, not a non-profit as it makes profits and its customer is really the US federal government. If that line were severed they'd still be in business but a lot of other providers might open up as competitors, such as companies from China as in China you can go to the hospital and give birth and int he same hospital they also provide abortions, because I have been stating it is merely a medical procedure anyone could provide potentially.

She found one, gave me two pamphlets...one on the condition the baby might have, the other on abortion. It felt like the wind was knocked out of me. I looked at what my baby might have and became terrified. I vividly remember being very scared and shocked that I was contemplating abortion for a planned baby within marriage. The next appt. the doctor encouraged an amniocentesis to confirm. Thankfully I didn't trust this certified doctor. I researched amniocentesis procedure and concluded it terribly unsafe and unnecessary. I left that doctor office and hospital for good. My baby happened to come naturally at 27 weeks. She was 2 lbs. Her head was the size of a tangerine. Her teeny tiny body in the nicu was covered with electrical cords. We tearfully hoped our little girl would make it. 6 weeks later she was 4lbs and declared stable to be brought home. Disturbing to think of the horrors at abortion clinics. The peaceful setting of the nicu saving lives in contrast is exact opposite. I've met 1lb baby survivals. My uncle was a 3lb survival, born in 1960s, his body frame fills the doorway, he's so tall! I love my happy helpful hilarious bubbly beautiful baby girl.  She is a proud older sister to 3 siblings. Her name means shining light. Best decision I made in my entire life.

2019-04-04T01:43:17,"MY OPINION : While i think having an abortion might be traumatising, scaring and should be generally avoided. There are cases where having an abortion could be the best option. I agree with the fact that terminating a pregnancy even though you can take care of the baby is wrong but everything is not that simple. Giving birth to the child is not enough, you need to take care of them, love them, financially support them till they can support themselves, teach them to be good people, educate them and so many other responsibilities that come with having a baby. What life is a child going to have when the parents themselves are unstable.  I know there are many options once you give birth but it doesn't guarantee quality life for the child, it could actually in turn be much more traumatising for them.  Having a child just because society believes that having an abortion is wrong is not going to help either, this could stem resentment, the mother or parents could start seeing the child as a burden, the child would not get the love and attention they deserve. And these are just some of the reasons, there is also the fact that having a child impacts a woman's life in so many ways.. ways i cant even begin to explain. Having a choice is important not only for the future of the parents but also the child.  I hope to never be in a position where I have to choose whether to abort or keep the baby but thats MY choice that doesn't mean that women who do get abortions or are thinking about it should be looked down upon.  It's a tough decision that should really be thought through because choosing life doesn't always guarantee a smooth ride.",0,0,Disha Shenoy,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.15700231481481483,2019-04-04 01:43:17,False,True

When I asked for a referral to a Dr (meaning an OBGYN) I was given a list of Abortion Clinics.  This is the world we live in. How mortifying that this is how women are expected to think in such linear terms when becoming pregnant at any time other than a white picket fence 1950s timeline. We are told: Have baby = life ruined. Have abortion = still thrive  and achieve all of your goals.   That is how we are programmed. How very sad.   And then at the same time so many women struggle to conceive. 🙁   I am not saying that I know what the right choice for every woman is. That would be absurd. What I am saying is; Where are the examples of both sides? Where is the real conversation about real lives? About choices on both sides? Where are the stories of the MANY women who SUCCEED against the odds, keeping their baby even when it is not under “ideal” circumstances by society’s dated standards? Why does feminism still hold on to those dated standards, instead of challenging them? Shouldn’t feminism be proudly acknowledging that women CAN have a baby at a time that isn’t 100% ideal and still have a wonderful, beautiful, successful life? Why does the Pro “Choice” Movement only talk about and celebrate 1 of the 2 choices? 🧐 There is a “Shout your Abortion” campaign......but not a “My baby didn’t ruin my life”’ campaign. LOL Young girls need to hear both sides. Instead, abortion is shoved down all of our throats like its some kind of liberating act. You know what would be more liberating? A more honest and less one-sided conversation praising abortion.  For the ladies who were pressured by society and family to have an abortion because they’re told it will ruin their life and career ......but they had their baby and ALSO achieve success. Where is their movement? For the ones who *Gasp* had a baby AND still made it in their educations and careers? The one climbing the corporate ladder with a baby on her hip? The one who is a stay at home mom and loves every second of it and wouldn’t trade it for the world? They aren’t aliens. It’s happening every day all around us.

2019-04-04T15:53:55,"Just 18 days after conception, the baby’s heart begins to beat. At six weeks, brain waves can be measured. At eight weeks, the vital organs are functioning and fingerprints have formed. At nine weeks, the unborn baby is able to feel pain. Over 700,000 abortions each year are performed after this point in the pregnancy. By the beginning of the second month, the unborn child, small as it is, has begun to look distinctly human, though the mother may not even be aware that she is pregnant! By the time the baby is eleven weeks old, he or she breaths (fluid), swallows, digests, sleeps, dreams, wakes, tastes, hears, and feels pain. Babies born prematurely can survive outside the womb as young as 20-25 weeks old. Yet, all that is necessary to make the baby a grown human being is already there from the moment of conception. All it needs is time to mature.  Former Surgeon General, Dr. C. Everett Koop stated “We now know when life begins because the test-tube baby proves that life begins with conception. What do you have in the dish? An egg and a sperm. What do you add to it to get a baby? Nothing.” Though it is wee, it is still a real person, just as a crumb of bread is still real bread. No one who has been given the gift of life should dare despise the day of small beginnings.

2019-04-05T03:02:27,"I've always been against abortion.  I was adamantly against it when I was a child, even when my mother hatefully screamed in my face about a woman's right to choose.  I suggested such a woman should choose not to have sex.  She said it was impossible.  I would eventually learn that a lot of women hated me for that, and I was content to remain alone and single rather than get involved in the clusterf**k that was the lives of most of the people I knew.  The attitudes of people on this issue are fanatical.  I mentioned one day that it was my birthday, and someone said that I had just had my birthday just months before.  I said it was my real birthday, the anniversary of my conception.  Everyone went silent and gave me a funny look.  I was a little confused until I realized I had made a very controversial political statement among people who seemed to have strong opinions.  You can't serve two masters, and you have to realize how people who favor abortion will hear your point of view, even if you try to soften the blow, or express your opinion in the most indirect way, like celebrating the anniversary of your conception:  they will hear you calling them murderers, and baby killers.  There really is no other way to put it because that's what it is, and it will eventually have to be treated that way.  I had to listen for the rest of my life to my mother's repeated attempts to justify abortion, and she sort of hated me because I had always taken a hard line against it.  At times it seemed as though I broke her spirit.  I was sorry for that, but I could not back down on such an important issue.  If sexual pleasure is to be considered so important that murdering babies is an acceptable trade off, why shouldn't any pleasure be an acceptable excuse for murdering anyone?  If the inconvenience of an unwanted baby is an acceptable reason for killing, why shouldn't any inconvenience be an acceptable reason for killing anyone?  It's hard to live in a world so full of murderers when they hate you for being opposed to murder.  I hate that I have become so accustomed to living in a world where most people hate me, where they must hate me, or they will hate themselves.

I have been to planned parenthood for regular exams when I didn't have insurance, and I also went there later for pregnancy verification, which I needed for insurance to cover prenatal care. When I got my pregnancy verification, the staff at PP were very supportive, offered materials about local groups that helped with baby supplies, and were in general very congratulatory and happy for me. There was not even a remote suggestion that I should get an abortion. My adult daughter also used planned parenthood for her exams and for birth control when she didn't have insurance as well. Luckily we now both have insurance and have regular doctors, but the majority of what PP does is NOT abortion. And the majority of people who work there are not monsters devaluing human life and acting like corporate witches.    Want to end abortion? Here's how you do it. Create a society without extreme poverty. Demand decent low-cost housing and the demolition of all substandard public housing projects. Guarantee the same level of excellent public education to all citizens, regardless of income (Finland does this, and has one of the best education systems on the planet, if not the best). Provide universal health care and a universal basic income to all citizens. Provide early and extensive sexual education and free birth control to all citizens. Provide low-cost or free public  higher education or trade programs. In essence, turn this society into a place where no person has an excuse to get mindlessly pregnant and then no choice but to abort. You can't keep turning the country into a shithole where 9 guys own everything and poor kids are going to schools with mold infestations and no books and your government claims to care about ""life"" while selling white phosphorus to Saudi Arabia and then expect people to care about unborn fetuses. We don't even appear to care about the living children who exist in this country - why would anyone care about ones that haven't even been born yet?

We have to change people's mindset from the inside out so that they would never consider an abortion whether it's legal or not.

Box office receipts for Friday April 5, 2019, the 8th day of its release, place Unplanned at #8 nationwide. Now showing on an expanded 1,516 theater screens across America, Unplanned pulled in another $1,040,000 at the box office with a strong per theater average of $656, bringing the total in box office receipts to $10,307,510 which far surpasses the negative expectations for the pro-life movie that the abortion lobby and its media partners predicted during their all out pre-release war to block Unplanned from being shown or advertised in most major media outlets. Comparing Unplanned's stellar showing at the box office thus far with the recently released pro-abortion propaganda documentary RBG which attempted to sell the life and career of rabidly pro-abortion Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a champion of liberty and women's rights, it is abundantly clear that Americans' pocketbooks are choosing a Pro-Life message over that of abortion industry dogma. While RBG received Oscar nominations and idolatrous worship across the same secular media platforms that have vigorously tried to blacklist and boycott Unplanned, Americans are using their feet and their dollars to tell the media and the movie industry that the days of selling to America an unchallenged pro-abortion message without consequences are over. After 8 days of box office ticket sales, RBG had only accumulated a total of $702,044 compared to Unplanned's 8 day total of $10,040,000. It took RBG 45 days to earn $10 Million in box office receipts and that was only done with the assistance of every major liberal newspaper, magazine and tv news channel promoting it as some sort of ""glorious and heroic"" masterpiece. While the pro-abortion lobby which controls the Academy Awards made sure RBG received two Oscar nominations for Best Documentary and Best Original Song, Americans can expect Unplanned to be treated by the Academy Awards with the same contempt that it showed towards Mel Gibson's masterpiece The Passion of The Christ. However, at the end of the day it is neither money nor awards which matter. What truly matters is how many lives are saved from the for-profit abortion mills of Planned Parenthood. Like Nazi Germany's concentration camps during World War II, America has already seen an entire generation of human babies of all races and genders wiped from the face of the earth in the abortion mills of Planned Parenthood. Unplanned is a banner being courageously waved in the air by those who are desperately racing to save as many human lives as possible from Planned Parenthood. I am making my stand in this generation!

Out of curiosity, I had asked the Lord the same question a few years ago and a few days later I was led to read Genesis 9. I found my answer in verse 4 which tells us that the life is in the blood.  God said the same thing in Leviticus 17:11and 14 -'for the life of the flesh is in the blood'. Therefore, it does not matter whether an abortion is carried out at an early stage,  it is still the taking of a life.  In case someone reading has had/performed/facilitated or supported an abortion, please understand that insisting on being right does not change the fact that a life was put out. Life is life.

I thought men should not be making decisions about women’s choices for people and situations they have no knowledge. I guess I have become “woke” in a non leftist way and have learned there is no magic wand and somebody actually has to go inside, and snip off the tiny little head, arms, and legs of a living human being.

I have since come to believe this is outright murder of a tiny defenseless person.

While Unplanned finished in the Top Ten over the weekend at #8, the Pro-Life movie spiked up to #7 at the Box Office on Sunday. A review of the leading entertainment news websites demonstrated the continued discriminatory pro-abortion-influenced blackout and blacklisting of UnPlanned. UnPlanned was not mentioned in any of the primary reviews of box office results for this weekend on either Box Office Mojo or Variety. This does not lesson the profound impact that Unplanned is having at movie theaters or among the choices moviegoers were making during the weekend. Unplanned has now accumulated a box office total of $12,467,510 during its initial 10 day run in movies theaters. The nearly $12.5 Million box office total doubles the Production budget of $6 Million for Unplanned. It also places Unplanned at #6 all time for movies produced by Pure Flix, the Christ-based movie production company that has revolutionized the introduction of a steady stream of Christian movies for American moviegoers who desire a more family-friendly and pro-Biblical experience when they are choosing the movies and theaters they spend their money on. https://www.boxofficemojo.com/studio/chart/?studio=pureflix.htm",3,2,MrJamesHartline,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.13095238095238096,2019-04-07 17:09:09,False,True

2019-04-10T03:40:50,"I am really glad and surprised the comment section of this video is not disabled. It's so bad people that will generalize the meaning of this movie, the so-called pro-life. It is extremely simple. You do not need a movie or(truth be told) an emotional manipulation factor(which is what this movie is, an over-compensation) to motivate you to lean to any side, pro or against other than facts. If you get pregnant and there is a good chance that quality of the life of the child will suffer enough(like you being inexperienced and/or uneducated and/or financially incapable etc. etc.)  and have NO OTHER CHOICE, then seriously, go for the abortion option as soon as possible, before BY FACT the child has grown up enough to have a nervous system developed fully and thus be able to feel the pain of an abortion.  It might sound kinda cruel(and imagine that this is coming from a vegan) but truth is life ain't always sunshine and rainbows, but if you knew that well enough you would probably almost never get pregnant in the first place(exceptions don't apply to this whole thing obviously). The child will never know and it would be extremely unlikely to even have a happy-successful life to begin with, inside this cruel as fuck world/planet, which is literally and mostly filled with uneducated lazy and mentally handicapped people which, exactly because of that fact would-will casually misinterpret your and your child's intentions(for its entire lifespan) thus causing so much pain and suffering to you and it and everyone's around them including themselves(feedback loop). So for everyone's sake, don't fuck up just because you like sex more than being a responsible individual and a member of society, because, in the end, it's both your lives' at stake and even more at times. First, strive to become a responsible enough adult and then sure go ahead and have as many children as it's wise to have(this sounds a bit weird for most but think about it) otherwise don't bother fucking other people's lives with your immature choices, it's REALLY, LITERALLY, that simple!",1,1,George Indestructible,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.07091666666666668,2019-04-10 03:40:50,False,True

All people would get the sterilization device installed, and they can control the device via their smart phones. When the decide they want to make people,  they open the PhrrTility App on their Cell phone,  type in their password, and activate the device. When they want to avoid making people, again,  just open the app, and disable fertility in their own body,  via bluetooth 5.1 Everyone can be sterilized, or activate their fertility, completely at will,  right from their smart phone.   Android or Apple. The  implanted biotech device would also provide information on your heartbeat,  oxygen levels, temperature, right on your phone. It could be a voluntary thing,  or made mandatory for all citizens.

2019-04-12T06:30:38,"I just saw this movie today after my mom asked me to go with her. I didn't know what to expect and honestly wasn't really keen on seeing it. I went into it thinking it was going to be a really controversial, extremely conservative, boring documentary, but it definitely wasn't. No matter where you stand on the subject of abortion, you SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE. Just go into it with an open mind, and maybe you'll come out knowing something you didn't going in. If you are strictly pro-choice are you going to walk out of the theater completely changed? Maybe not. But what's so great about this movie is that it's raw and real. It's not sugarcoated. It is definitely hard to watch at times, just FYI, but that's what we need. It shows what goes on inside a Planned Parenthood and how the decision to get an abortion or even to become pregnant in the first place affects people's lives, and that's the kind of awareness we need. Of course no media outlets are promoting this movie and honestly that's just sad. My point is is that no matter what side of the aisle you're on, if you go see this movie I guarantee you won't regret it. I think you'll come out with more of an open mind on the topic, that's all. I'm so glad I saw it. The acting by the lead girl was amazing btw, hope to see more of her in the future.

2019-04-12T07:13:41,"I was just reading an article about this movie, put out by someone who is obviously very left, very pro choice. The article quoted an expert on fetuses who was laughing at a scene in the movie where a fetus was being aborted at 13 weeks, and said that the “fighting for its life and twisting in pain” was so unrealistic because fetuses don’t even really feel pain at that stage, they’re not at that point in development yet. Ok. Fine. That may be true, I cant claim to be an expert on what a baby fees at 13 weeks. But then, I thought about what the pro choicers passed in New York and what they are trying to pass in other states. Late term, in some cases, full term abortions. The problem that has come about as a result of legalized abortion is that it just keeps getting worse and worse. I have a one year old daughter. Around 22-23 weeks is when I started to feel her kicking, rolling around, later hiccuping, reacting to changes in light, a few times I even felt her jump when I spoke loudly after a long silence, startling her. They’re never going to convince me that babies cant feel pain or discomfort at that stage and that there’s a good enough reason to not do everything possible to save a late term baby in the event of complications. There will never be a good enough reason to just euthanize a full term infant just because some doctor says it’s ok or because some poor excuse for a woman changed her mind last minute and decided “wait, don’t think I want to be stuck with this after all.” Activists cry and boohoo over animals being euthanized when they are no longer viable or convenient. They call capitol punishment inhumane. And yet feel nothing  over the loss of an innocent child. Disgusting what abortion has come to and I’m glad there are still many people out there wanting to keep attention on the issue.",0,0,VR Shepherd,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.025086580086580088,2019-04-12 07:13:41,False,True

2019-04-16T02:24:22,"tbh it looks like a good movie, however, I'm still not anti-abortion because I believe the right should not be taken away from women. and under certain circumstances, women may need to get an abortion. For example, what if the woman was nowhere near ready for a baby and it was forced on her from society that it's so wrong what she's doing and she should feel horrible when getting an abortion. when in reality, she is probably making the right decision so when she is ready to have kids she can financially support them. Or if the baby was going to be born with brain damage and stuff, you can stop it early on (or even 6 months in) and stop your future baby from living a life where it seems as they would be suffering (I don't mean get an abortion if your kids gonna have autism-you can if you want, I mean harmful things). All in all, everyone has their own opinions, but if anything comes up when your voting (I can't vote yet) and it has something to do with a women's right to have an abortion, please vote that a woman can have that right. even if you don't agree with it, that's your opinion, and your feelings are affecting others are great costs.",0,0,Girl that cant Sing,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.08590225563909774,2019-04-16 02:24:22,False,True

2019-04-18T08:06:43,"3 most popular pro-choice arguments debunked  1. Birth poses a threat to her body, so it's self defence to kill it  Don't you think that birth poses a threat to the child's health as well? Women's pelvic bones can seriously damage the fetus. Brachial plexus injury occurs in 1-3 children per 1000 births. Every year there are 10 000 born children diagnosed with cerebral palsy every year (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_injury). As you can see on Wikipedia, birth can cause them bone fractures, brain damage, bruises or meconium aspiration syndrome which can lead to pneumonia and pneumothorax. In fact, birth poses greater danger to children than to mothers. No danger for the fetus would occur if the baby didn't need to travel through cervix and vagina out of the woman's body. Do you think we should cut her in half so the child has a 100% of being born uninjured? Just as I don't approve cutting the mother in two, so the child can get out easier and with no risk of head damage, I do not approve killing the fetus, crushing its skull and tearing it apart limb by limb to lower the maternal mortality rate, which is already very low (12 deaths per 100 000 women in developed countries (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality)).    2. No one is allowed to use my body against my will  That's true, but if you don't want anyone in your house, you and your partner shouldn't lead them in the first place. If you don't want them, wait at least 9 months for them to come out and don't shoot them. Do you think that if someone else in case of rape and basically you and your partner in case of consentual sex stuck one's head in your window and can't pull it out, should you be allowed to legally chop off their head in order to have a view out of a window again?  We have to think about the definition of responsibility. Responsibility is ability to willingly make an action to prevent or make something to happen. Is fetus a burglar who voluntarily and consciously got into you against your will? Is fetus responsible for being inside the mother? Unlike its mother who really is responsible in more than 99% (excluding case of rape), it is not. Only two people responsible for conception of a child are the parents. Everyone who's allowed to have sex knows of the risks of getting pregnant and catching an STD. Would you blame others for catching an STD?   I am sorry that someone you and your partner threw off a cliff is holding your hand, but you can't let them fall (actually in reality you don't just let them fall but you actually kill them). Wait 9 months unil they climb up. You both deserve equal protection and no one can kill any of you.    3. It's not human  What determines when it's human?   Heartbeat? What about the people living with an artificial heart and a pacemaker?  Brain function? Fetuses have a slightly different brain function because they dont use all of their senses yet and dont move much. Its like a sleeping person. And newborns have lesser brain function than us as well.  If you say that before 6 weeks it's not human because it has not fully developed arms is a bad argument because there are people without arms. Without legs, even without hearts who live with a artificial hearths. Every human is a living integrated cluster of cells filled with human DNA. Nothing more.  Shouldn't we than kill children because they have no permanent teeth, so they are not fully human?  If you think that fetuses aren't fully human, because their brains aren't fully formed, human brains develop until 20 or 30 years after birth (https://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/02/18/at-what-age-is-the-brain-fully-developed/).  Every single one species on this planet came into being as a single cell who in most cases didn't resemble the final mature individual. Development of the human organism both prenatal and postatal is on Wikipedia (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_human_body). You can clearly see that every scientific article regards embryos and fetuses as humans who just aren't fully mature yet - just like children.",1,1,Ivana Kasardová,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.07594254230617867,2019-04-18 08:06:43,False,True

This is straight from Planned Parenthood Website  If you're under 18, you may or may not have to tell a parent in order to get an abortion — it all depends on the laws where you live.   Some states don't have any laws about telling your parents or getting their permission. But some states say you have to get permission from a parent or older family member to have an abortion. Other states don’t make you get permission, but your parents will have to know that you’re getting an abortion.   You may be able to get a judge's permission to have an abortion without telling your parents. This is called ""judicial bypass"".  The exact rules are different in different places. Find information on parental involvement in your state below.  And know that you’re not alone. If you’re pregnant and want to have an abortion, call your nearest Planned Parenthood health center as soon as possible. They can help explain the laws in your state, let you know what your options are, and give you tips on talking with your parents.  It's important to take action right away. Abortion is very safe, but there are more risks the longer you wait. There are also time limits on abortion in some states. And if you need a judicial bypass, it can take a while to get through the process.  (Updated June 2018)  Alabama  Your state requires that one of your parents give permission for your abortion.

2019-04-26T18:57:33,"My first thought when I heard about this movie was well, who better to give a well-rounded look at abortion than someone who has confidently walked both sides of the issue?  This is a woman who worked hard and grew her career quickly but then when she directly assisted with an abortion was traumatized by what she saw, and completely changed her viewpoint which lead her to tell people about what she witnessed, and how it was nothing like what she was told.   I think if anyone was confident about a huge part of their life and job, and then was in shock to that degree over facts they learned, then they would probably want to tell someone.  No matter what view you have on abortion, you should admire this woman for her courage for speaking her truth.  She is doing it in spite of many reasons not to, and to me, that sounds like courage - from what it sounds like, the same courage she tapped into while building her career. Really, if people don't deserve and arent' free to know facts from people who know them, and there are people trying to hide facts in order to push an agenda, then most people would call that fraud, or conning someone, or brainwashing, and those things are generally considered HUGE violations of individual rights.

Or the child stays with their mother who doesn’t love them because they weren’t wanted. So in the end either the mother kills themselves or suffers and won’t ever be able to get better or the child is given birth and suffers. Don’t give me the crap that sometimes it works out. It’s not always the case. Being pro life is being only pro birth because after that, it’s just misery for the child. You’re risking lives for a fetus that can’t feel pain. Or feel.

2019-06-06T14:14:02,Ugh. This movie frustrates me. I understand that some people are pro life but they don’t need to make women and anyone else feel like a monster for getting an abortion. Getting an abortion is so hard for people and movies like this make them feel even worse. When I watched the first half of this trailer I was happy to see a movie that was actually supporting abortion but I was completely disgusted for the second half. The fetus can’t feel anything until roughly 14-20 weeks. I would never get an abortion but don’t make people feel like monsters for getting one. People mess up and that’s okay. Abortion should not be used as birth control but it’s fine to be used. It disgusts me even more when young girls will actually die from carrying a baby inside of them and aren’t allowed to get an abortion. Also if someone is 20 years old and doesn’t have the money to take care of their child and it wouldn’t be safe for the child then get an abortion. It’s not a bunch of old white mens choice on what a woman should do with her body.

Pues ese FIAT !!! fue la acción más grande de valentía y trascendencia hecha por persona alguna en la historia. Ese fue EL SÍ A LA VIDA DE MARÍA.   Recuerden lo que dijo nuestro Señor Jesucristo: Uds. harán cosas más grandes que yo !!! Pues sepan que millones de personas como Jesús o como Moisés pudieron salvarse y venir a hacer grandes cosas por su gente pero se les negó abruptamente esa posibilidad.

En conclusión se ha combinado 2 momentos de nuestra historia, el actual de la guerra cultural o MARXISMO CULTURAL con las antiguas persecuciones.  Lo único que nos queda frente al poder del dinero (y mediático) de la CULTURA DE LA MUERTE es luchar con sus mismas armas, LAS REDES, LA INFORMACIÓN ABUNDANTE QUE DEBE SER COMPARTIDA y si encima oramos para obrar con sabiduría pues entonces estamos más que listos para ésta guerra cultural y nos queda de otra que unirnos entre aquellos que no pensamos igual pero que LA DEFENSA DE LA VIDA, DE LA FAMILIA, FE, CULTURA O PATRIA NOS UNE !!!  Fuerza hermanas que están muy asustadas por ésta cultura de la muerte que las presiona para que maten a sus hijos, nunca olviden que NUNCA ESTARÁN SOLAS y si pueden traten de oír el corazón de sus pequeños bebés que suena tremendamente fuerte y demostrándole al mundo que ESTÁ LLENO DE VIDA y que tiene el orgullo de llevar su sangre y que sólo con el amor y esfuerzo de uds. vendrá para ser una personita de bien, que tanto necesitamos en la actualidad, que ellos sean su MOTOR y MOTIVO para seguir adelante...

Abortions increase the risk of cervical and breast cancer as a pregnancy is terminated unnaturally.. It also increases the chances of miscarriage with future pregnancies.  It also causes higher chance of needing c-sections due to other complications that arise do to the harm done to the mother during a lot of the abortions and their methods. Low birthweight and premature babies etc...  Of course abortion clinics will not spell out all these risks to a pregnant woman as they would lose income to their clinics.  Then there is the issue of who has the majority of abortions, first it is usually black women, followed by Eastern European.  With the number of abortions done yearly it puts certain population growths into decline. As they say a nation that kills its own children is a nation without hope. Many of those children could be the nations future inventors etc... the ones who find cures for cancer etc... When you do not look at a small child as a life it is a shame would you then not look at a sapling as a life and pluck all the saplings from the forest, once all the trees grow old and fall there would be no future trees.

No religion, no mother, no siblings are allowed to make it. It's her body, her choice.

So everything ended up like a Hallmark movie.   In their case, it was a moment when they just ignored the precautions, and ... just happened. Fortunately, the end was a happy one, but we all know - that isn't always the case. There are raped minors, there are dangerous situations for both of them, illnesses or malformations that can ruin much more than just one life. We need to expand sexual education programs, we need to educate people to understand the risks. We need to fight sexism and extreme religious intolerance that only lead to abuse, forced marriages, lack of education... We need access to health programs, and also maybe to reform the adoption procedures, to help mothers that cannot afford a child to carry to term then help a family to adopt and give a warm shelter to that baby...

Now I have a different view because most of the women that’ll get abortions are liberal anyways and who needs more fascists in this world to tell you what is right from wrong. They really think the fetus is part of their body and they have a right to get rid of that part of their body. Well, nobody is saying you can’t lop-off part of your body if you so desire. Why don’t they sever their arm or leg which is part of their body? A fetus is not part of their body. It floats in the water and when the water breaks it’s time for delivery. That’s why they’re empathic about their need for a sex-ed curriculum because of their lack of understanding of the human anatomy. It grows in your body but it is not part of your body. Duh?  The fetus is not a clump of cells that magically transform to a baby upon delivery. Duh? A fetus feels pain and anguish and has a heartbeat at six weeks gustation. The fetus is human life. Duh? Even the lefty gods have decreed it so. (that’s their scientists which they believe without question) Some states have overturned the Roe vs Wade decision because of that determination by the scientists that state the fetus is a living human organism at six weeks when a definite heartbeat can be heard. In Ontario Canada where I’m from, abortion is paid for by the taxpayer through their Ontario Health Care Insurance premiums (OHIP). As far as I’m concerned, I’m not against abortion if it is by a lefty but I refuse to pay more taxes for idiots who can’t come up with birth-control or invest ten bucks to buy contraceptives (condoms). Why should the taxpayer foot the bill of thousands of dollars per abortion because some lazy ass forgot to buy condoms and don’t tell me what about rape which only represent less than 1% of all abortions.

And frankly, as an ex fetus who doesn’t feel or remember anything from the womb, I wouldn’t feel too much loss from being aborted at that stage, especially if my mother had financial or health complications.  Again I know there will be hate but I want to remind you I’m more than happy with everyone’s decision to not abort. I simply think sometimes it’s in others best interest and they at least deserve the choice. (I don’t hate children. I absolutely adore them but I simply don’t see them as the same as a fetus which are basically underdeveloped muscle tissues. Also I’ve volunteered at orphanages before and the absolute sad state of some children... they don’t ever receive the same quality of a parents love and most never get adopted. Don’t subject more poor youth into this system.)",5,4,Michelle Tran,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.14135802469135803,2019-07-14 21:24:18,False,False

If you are so proud to be anti-abortion then please tells me how many children have you adopted that needed a home? A family?... how many children have you helped that are going through foster care? How many children have you stood up for when you see them being physically, mentally, and sexually abused in a family who wasn’t ready for them? Good for you for having a great life in a family who loved you and was ready to lay their lives down for you but the reality is that so many children probably wish they hadn’t been born because of the terrible life they are growing up in. Tell me are you the type of person that would help a single 19 year old mother take care of her baby while she went to school without conditions? Because I know single young mothers and half of them don’t have the help when they have so many people in her life that can help. What about the women who were raped? Forced to have children in a toxic/abusive relationship? What about women who know that the pregnancy could kill her causing this baby to no longer have a mother? The reason it’s a choice for all women is because the whole world is not full of great people. Open your eyes and realize that not everyone on this planet are “angels”. Fathers leave, pregnancies become life or death, families become dangerous, pregnancies happen because some rapist couldn’t keep it in his pants, babies get deathly sick and may not survive the birth itself. Stand up and speak for the children that are already here and leave these women to make their own damn choice. It’s their bodies, not yours. You were lucky enough to have a great, loving, prepared family, good for you.

It helps prevent unplanned pregnancies and eliminates the need for most abortions and prevents the cruelty experienced by fatherless kids from the get go but hey...monotheists need to create problems and ignore modern day solutions in order to stay relevant. They also tragically ignore the consequences associated with fatherlessness among the lower class because these so called conservatives like to posture themselves as being informed feminists and saviours, while conveniently pretending poor boys without fathers don’t suffer; they always ignore this fact completely (and conveniently) because the lower level of societies don’t bring them the cash. So, a movie about the benefits of birth control methods wouldn’t be the kind of movie that makes money for them. Sadly, when it comes to monotheists, human tragedy only counts when it is defined by their religion and this means massive blind spots and a lack of valuable information.

Like a cell (embryo?) vs sentient being (human). To this day no one has the answer. I believe there are two possibilities. A kind of spirt enters the fetus at X weeks or it enters the baby at X weeks. This is why many children express past lives. I am pretty sure that an embryo is not yet sentient.

I don't think anyone is stopping you guys for believing abortion is wrong or not for you, but not everyone shares your views, opinions and thoughts. Giving someone an option is what it means by legalising abortion. It isn't by force, and it isn't because you had a child in you that might come out deformed and forcing you to abort. No! It's about giving women the option to choose, some rape victim could choose not to be reminded by the ordeal for full 9 months, if it so happened she got pregnant in the process.

2019-08-11T17:12:29,I am a male.! I agreed to two women having abortions. And it was at the same time. I really didn't truly want to. But the one said her father and mother would kill her. No they wouldn't they might not have been happy. But they would have forgiven her eventually. As far as the other girl she has had abortions before she didn't seem to think it was no big deal.. But now I've had to live with this pain. I let my own children down. And decided that they should not live. No one should have that right. They are still humans inside the womb. And they do feel. There's nothing I can do to turn back the hands of time. But I thought if I was given the key to the whole world. That I could have or do as I please. I would gladly say no just to have them by my side to call me Daddy. Don't let no one talked you into this. And I've learned a lot about God since then and I've got to learn more but he and Satan are as real as we are. And God would not be happy and he isn't happy but he forgave me. But I have not forgiven myself. I look at the two children I have right now 25 + 28 and I imagine what the other two would have looked like they would have been 31 years old. I couldn't even imagine being without these two. I have let alone the two you are the Executioner you decide whether they live or die.. Even if it's a rape. It is your choice. But you can always give the kid up for adoption. It's not worth going to hell. And it's not worth the pain of not having them. Just because it's by a father that does not want you or the child. That child will not grow up to be like him. He will grow up the way you raised him or her. And they could even take care of you when you get older. This is such a touchy subject. But God gives us free will I just like to say think about it.! before you do it. There is no turning back. If you don't want the child. Give him or her a chance to live. and put them up for adoption. There's so many people that want children and can't have them. but it's no problem for the person that don't want the child. Because you will never live it down or I should say never forget. I had no one to tell me that the baby could feel everything or even that it had a heartbeat and little fingers that were developing. I actually didn't think it was a live until after it was born. I know that sounds stupid but I didn't know no better and that's no excuse. But you have the choice you know the truth because of the internet. Don't make a sacrifice 2 the evil one Lucifer. It makes him happy when we do this it takes from God this is part of the spiritual war that we are in. And don't think that God would agree of you doing this because it was a mistake. that baby so picked you as a parent for a reason. And that's. God loves all his children including us. Go to him call on him and call to  Jesus and ask him for help and the knowledge and will to make the right choice. God bless you all. And God bless every little child that was sacrificed. you may not think it's a sacrifice but it is. please make the right choice you are not being judged it's your choice. it's a choice and if we decide for the baby to be put to death. You may think you will never think about it again but you will and it will haunt you in your dreams. Pray hard. Use the pill use protection and don't put yourself in this position of a decision that you will regret and that other people will judge you. good luck and God bless. having 15 minutes of lust is not worth the pain.!

Those clinics were made for women that are desperate, that don't want a child, not for some ""corporate"". Hell, they are free.   Second: Replazing scientific facts with sementalism is idiotic.

Good to know Christians love sperm so much though ;).    Trust me, if abortion was actually murder, you'd see most doctors and nurses walk out of their workplaces and protest non-stop at the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court and Capitol Hill.  What's more, a 1000 homeless people died in the time it took to make this waste of millions of dollars bullshit films.

The baby did nothing wrong to you and there is adoption options if you do not want to keep it. Again that is my opinion but people have to make their own choice whether right or wrong.

2019-09-23T13:13:05,"my mom was 16  when she had me, she was terrified scared and embarrassed and sadly abortion was brought up. But her family rallied around her and decided against it thank God. She decided to put me up for adoption with a loving family who couldn't have children biologically but wanted so desperately for the blessings parenthood brings. She gave them the most amazing gift. This is something planned parenthood never even attempts to do. Abortion should be the absolute LAST resort for desperate women. Anyway, 18 years later I met my birth mom in person. Now I am 32 and we have a great relationship that never would have happened if I was aborted. So many families could be blessed with the chance of adopting a child. People like me deserve a chance like anyone else. The baby in a womens belly doesn't have a choice in their existence. The mother and father made that choice for them... They chose to have unprotected sex, and the result of that leads to human life. That choice shouldn't be easy to remove jlike a cyst or mole. That choice shouldn't even be made at all. When there are so many people out there who would love to give a child a home.....😞   This movie was great. Its a shame it was banned in Canada where I am currently living. It seems the people on the left pretend to be tolerant until you put their agendas and beliefs into question. Then they turn from ""tolerant"" to  ""fascist"" pretty damn quick. Yet movies making fun of Christians, conservatives, movies with rape scenes, constant murder and war are completely appropriate. However,  the honest story of a women who actually was a big part of Planned Parenthood is going ""too far""..... weird how that works huh?   I guess the powers at play dont want people to know the real reasons and motivations behind planned parenthood.

As to be expected it is laden with misogyny, and the only solution offered by the pro-lifer to a woman seeking an abortion: You don't have to do this. Have your baby and serve your God-given duty as a mother. Any country that is pro-life is a social disaster for women and the unwanted babies they're forced to have. Imagine walking down the street and a gang of ally kids beat the crap out of your pathetic god-fearing ass, steal your valuables, and the only thing you see is the anger in their eyes. In a country like the United States where even the modest recipients of welfare are regarded as parasites. There's a reason there is no pro-life movement in Romania or Albania where women were subjected to decades of the states' pro-life policies.

2019-10-31T01:37:16,"At least for me, when it comes to either side on this debate, the pro-life (or as I like to say, ""pro-birth"") or the pro-choice group, the difficult thing for me is that the main arguments for both sides end up being complete bull#$%^: Pro-Life ""Abortion is murder"" argument: Considering that the definition of murder is ""the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought,"" even if you believe it is unlawful in all circumstances, that it involves the ""killing of a human being"" (which I do, BTW), there is absolutely NO way that you can prove that all abortions are done from ""malice aforethought,"" especially in the case of the woman who are undergoing abortions, and thus this argument falls apart. Pro-Choice ""My body, my rules"" argument: Considering that when we're talking about another living human within the mother's womb (just as I believe it isn't hard to say that a kitten with a cat's womb or a puppy within a dog's womb is still a cat or dog), when you make a choice here, it isn't JUST about ""your body"": its about the BABY's body too, and thus this argument falls apart. Personally, I'm one of those folks who believe that abortion should be ""rare but legal"" (e.g. in cases of rape and incest or the mother's life is at risk), but in the end, I just want to say that if anyone wishes to really make any good progress on issues like these, it is critical to 1) not straw-man the other side 2) give reasonable arguments which aren't full of bull@#$% and 3) to simply BE THERE for these poor women going through these climactic times in their lives.

That's under 10% of ""forced"" pregnancies that it's reasonable to abort the fetus asap.  But what's sad is 42% of women between ages 17 - 37  will have an abortion BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT READY ---- Even though they fucked their brains out and were not raped (18.3% of that number with multiple men at the same period. And these are not prostitutes. These are girls next door etc.)  The Pro choice movement is bullshit. It's  a murder cult of women who see their natural ability to conceive as a disadvantage. The bare minimum of under 10% pregnancies that occur because of failed contraception or via rape has been used to allow 90%+ of abortions to go through with almost 5 in 10 pregnant women who can't wait to murder a living being but  available to take care of a dog @ $100  a week for 10 - 12 years, walking them, bathing them, kissing them and paying for dog sitters.

But something that others need to realize is that plenty of pro-choicers don't like abortion. A lot of us think it's sad. BUT what we realize is that banning abortion has never actually reduced the number of abortions, it just stops women from having safe, clean places to have the procedure. For example, when Romania banned abortion in 1966, the motherhood mortality rate doubled (source: https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/16/what-actually-happens-when-a-country-bans-abortion-romania-alabama/ ). Bans also disproportionately affect poor women, while rich women are always able to bribe someone to have the procedure done safely. If you actually want to reduce abortion, fight for better access to sex ed and birth control. But history has shown that bans DON'T WORK and instead only put women's lives at risk.

I understand people don't want to go through pregnancy either, but that's a really small price to pay for saving a life.  I'm a feminist.

Well if you were just curious about that part, you can see real abortions @ abortionreality.com (actual videos of real abortions) or if thats too much for you, you can watch an animated video of how an abortion procedure is done at https://www.abortionprocedures.com/",1,1,Charlie ZA,gBLWpKbC3ww,0.18562500000000004,2020-01-01 23:32:35,False,False

Johnson's whole reasoning for supposedly switching to anti choice was based on a lie so... she never witnessed that baby ""fighting for its life"" when she was asked to ""help out"" on an abortion... Doctors at the clinic say she was never asked to help out with abortions, and an ultrasound abortion hadn't even been performed the day she claimed she witnessed it... She also had no evidence to support statements she made about PP and its supposed financial abortion incentives. She's kinda bullshit. Don't know why this movie was made as it grossly overexaggerates this story and paints Johnson as some kinda right wing messiah. Planned Parenthood's most common procedure isn't even abortions - only 3% of all procedures actually are.

Just for them to abuse that child or throw them in the even more abusive foster system, would you rather a child be aborted in the first trimester before they even have the ability to feel pain? Or would you rather a child ,that could have been aborted, physically and sexually abused, being mentally scarred for the rest of their life. Abortion isn't always right and I know that, but people have abortions for different reasons, maybe it shouldn't be as accessible as it is now but we should never be taking away the choice entirely. Under law, if you were to agree to give a kidney transplant to someone in need, at any point in time you have the ability to back out of that agreement, that person may die if they can;t find another donor, but you are not legally required to lend your body to someone else in need.

I'm pro abortions, as I am also pro men not wanting to be dads. Carrying a fetus is not something that should be forced on anyone, nor should someone tell another person to simply just never have sex. I am really tired of everyone trying to control how another human being lives when in reality they're not harming anyone. Since an unborn fetus if removed from the womb would not be able to live, therefore it's not truly alive. And that is my opinion on it. And for the goofy fucks who say stupid shit like ""They're not asking to die."" just hush lool because they're not asking to be alive either. Do any of you remember hovering over woman stalking them asking to grow inside their body? Also even when people do want to die, a lot of you are against that as well.
