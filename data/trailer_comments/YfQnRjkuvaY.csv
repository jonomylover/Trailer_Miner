2015-04-25T01:23:14,"A comment section filled with foolish Shymalan haters. Allow me to share a revelation I've had while looking at his movies and reactions. Neither, he the writing or acting is the problem, YOU are. You were so blown away by the twist of the Sixth Sense that all you wanted to see out of him was the twist in his later movies, so you ignored the plots of his later movies and thus when something happened you did not like you called it a twist and hated the movie, and then condemned him for it.  After watching his stuff, I have come to the conclusion that his movies are far too smart for their audiences. These days, audiences don't watch movies to learn or be inspired, they just want everything spoonfeed to them. Audiences today are like evil deities, they expect something to go their way and whenever some comes that challenges them they retaliate. Your always asking for something new, so when something ""new"" comes out you enjoy it, and almost immediately afterwords hate it and call it cliche. The truth is, there are only so many stories that can be told and have been told for thousands of years. So what if something has been done before? I want to see how it will be executed here.  I suggest you people rethink the way you look at movies and come to the sad fact that you have to give yourself to a movie, an movie does not give itself to you. And two more things, the plot twist of The Sixth Sense has been done before, and Avatar The Last Airbender was nothing but an attempt to make money off the success of Anime in America and is not really that good.

The grandad has a disorder where he can't control when he pee's and poop's so he wears diapers that he collects in the shed when he poop's in them.  At the end the girl discovers that they aren't her real grandparents via a Skype call with her mom and then finds her actual grandparents dead in the basement they weren't allowed in.  The grandad is left alone with the boy and takes off his dirty diaper that he just pooped in and rubs it in the boys face and the girl is left alone with the gran and the girl eventually stabs her to death and the boy repeatedly slams the granddads head in the fridge door, killing him.

2015-09-17T18:45:10,"This movie was just really bad- warning my comment is pretty spoiler-y like boring  wasn't scary but didn't have enough going on so it could be funny. Like the ""horror"" was funny but there was hardly any of it and the characters so unappealing I honestly didn't care if they made it through or not. And did they just forget about the germaphobe plot point for 90 percent of the movie bc i'm pretty sure people who are afraid of germs don't just lie down on the floor and in the dirt and flush the toilet with their hand as opposed to the foot. Also how do the kids not have ptsd after murdering two people and having shit rubbed in their face. And they implied the daughter went back and EDITED THE FOOTAGE of her murdering someone. What the fuck. Then they rap about it like nothing fucking happened!? Plus the art choice with the font to show what day it was oh my god how awful- like couldn't have used a calendar or something? not MONDAY NIGHT big red letters scary sounds jfc idk if that was supposed to be a ""child's editing"" but it was bad either way. Plus delivery of exposition through interviews in the kids ""documentary"" is the laziest, most forced thing i've ever seen. Also the kid who played the brother in the movie, during the flashback with their dad, had brown eyes, not blue, so there's that too. Also this movie's half-assed excuse with mental illness to blame for the state of the ""grandparents"" not only is really harmful to anyone who isn't neurotypical, but is so half-assed and poorly researched that it makes me sick. The kids not having any signs of post trauma stress disorder, and even fucking singing about what happened just makes things so much worse. Like it was an attempt at comedy but just came off extremely forced and brought up more plot holes. Like HOW DO THEY NOT HAVE PTSD OR ANY SIGNS OF TRAUMA AFTER BRUTALLY MURDERING TWO PEOPLE. It just pisses me off ?? Also the kid didn't have any shit on his face in shots immediately after the whole incident happened which was like ok. Don't go see if you think it looks funny, or scary, bc its very little of either.

The grandparents always felt off throughout the movie. Something was wrong VERY wrong with the whole situation, but you couldn't put your finger on it until the mandatory M. Night plot twist. Also, the acting was really good. OMG NANA WAS SO SINCERE WITH EVERYTHING SHE SAID UGH. There was one pretty bad thing though. There was a obvious plot hole.

If you want to expect the oven scene with those pain shouts from the girl, sorry for you to hear this, because it was replaced with the old man rubbing a shity diaper over the kid's face. Yeah, ""terror"". Seriously? The trama was quite good, but the characters fucked it all, with 'depresion times' and 'I-don't-have-a-fucking-idea-what's-going-right-now' moments. I expected more on this movie, but is actually the same crappy ""horror"" movie of nowadays, with a few screamers but with more 'toilet humor' (even I question myself, why some people likes that type of ""comedy""). Even the scene where the girl (that was a pain in the ass) frightens his bro is scarier than the other scenes of the movie. There where moments where I wanted to get up, say ""You know, fuck it all"" and go for a refund because this movie was, is and ever will be the same bullshit with themes poorly explained and stupid characters that are like ""Oh yeah, we just recorded how our ""grandma"" was naked while she was scratching the fucking door with her nails in midnight, and how our ""grandpa"" tried to kill somebody and having allucinations because he have schizophrenia, but everything is good because that's why they're old and they make us cookies, yaaay~"".

Their mother left when she was about 19 because she got into a huge fight with them that turned physical with them slapping each other. She ran off with this guy who she had kids with. The dad left when the boy was about 8 and the girl was 10 all because the boy lost a school football game. The kids meets the grandparents and they're pretty fucking strange. The grandpa shits himself and burns his diapers and is paranoid to the point of attacking strangers in public and also seems to have suicidal thoughts. The grandma also has weird episodes at night where she pukes, scratches the wall, and even walks around the house at night. The girl tries to interview the grandma about the day her mom left twice causing the grandma to freak the fuck out. Also, this other girl keeps stopping by to check on the grandparents because they both volunteer at some mental institute and haven't been showing up for a few days. It is revealed the main girl is insecure about her looks and does not look in the mirror, this does not affect the plot in any real way though... One night, the children are talking to their mom and tell her that they are really freaked out about their grandparents behaviour. The kids show the mom the grandparents on camera and it turns out they aren't really the grandparents and they have been staying with complete strangers for a week in their real grandparents home. These people seem to have escaped from the mental hospital, they murdered the real grandparents (the girl finds their bodies) and have been living their ever since. One night while playing a board game the couple go bat shit crazy. The old dude rubs shit from his diaper on the boys face. They also discover the women who kept coming got hung from a tree. The old women attacks the girl in which she takes some glass and stabs the old bitch to death. The boy slams the old guys head in a refrigerator. The cops arrive and save the kids.

Just to show grandma can take a step right each time???). The mum's interpretation is the best thing in the movie. But whats that scene at the end?
