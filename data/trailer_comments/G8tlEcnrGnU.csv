If nobody cared about drug problems there would have not been any movies made about it either. And if you pay closer attention, all the movies are basically the same old movie, just with different actors and backgrounds, but the basic set of plots and course actions are the same one(the same form of violence, faces of good & evil shit, the voices, words, sound effects, explosives, bullets, and all the predictable outcomes) over and over.

There is no joy in the story that is being told here but despite all that it is utterly brilliant.  This is the story of an FBI agent ( Emily Blunt ) who is seconded into an elite unit that deals with the drug barons on the Mexican border but not is all it seems. She is told very little and what she does know she doesn't like. This film is intense. It really does grip you. The first half an hour , especially the scenes when we are in Mexico , are stunning . The director , Denis Villeneuve , pulls no punches whatsoever and along with some great performances from Blunt , Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro this is a visual and sensual treat.

Mood/atmosphere is really important and I don't see enough of that in today's movies anymore. This is true craftsmanship. There are flicks where by the end of it you are done with your popcorn, then there are films where by the end your popcorn was left untouched because your heart has been stuck up your throat through the whole running, films where you are not a viewer but a passenger.   IMO, it takes full score 10/10 cinematography 10/10 sound 10/10 acting 10/10 dialogue  Action and suspense is one thing, but one scene kinda stood out to me, the part where the silhouettes of the soldiers disappearing into the darkness of the foreground at the twilight of dawn.  The film didn't treat you like an idiot either(another example of less is more), e.g ""you will be committing suicide"" just one line unfolds so many things, it starts with understanding the ownership of the gun, then your mind goes wild with even further prognostications, when it was stressed at the max already.  Some parts are less believable though, like (off the top of my head) the strength of the gangs on the highway or the men at the villa, rubberband, or dying man *casually* drive, *turn* and stop like that.

Therefore, she had me convince that she needed to go home!!  A MUST SEE for Adults unless you want your teenagers to realize the drug war in Mexico.  Also, the Police Officer, (must get his name) with the kid, he does great, especially, when Del Toro tells him to get out of the police car, the look that he gives is quick, realistic and outstanding which only certain actors can execute.   I would love to see Dadi Pinero acting with Benicio Del Toro Sanchez...Sicarii, Jewish assassins from the first century AD, however in Mexico it means ""Hitman"" which the Movie states it in the beginning.

2016-02-27T16:08:15,"The writers and directors did a good job showing viewers what it would be like for an FBI agent to join a CIA operation.  There is a difference in boundaries that each department uses.  This is why the female character has such a hard time following orders.  Del Toro's character is operating off of revenge and he's willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish his mission.  The CIA leader played by Brolin takes advantage of this and Blunts character figures that out and feels it's immoral.  Good display of good people having to make difficult choices and decisions for a greater good.  At the end however one will question if all these decisions even help the greater good.

2019-03-25T11:00:38,I really liked the movie!   However!   Emily Blunt’s character had unrealistic concerns about the actions of this elite unit.   The shootout at the border where agents blasted two carloads of armed cartel hit men seemed to bother her.  What were the agents supposed to do at that border?   She never explains why she so objected to the team defending themselves and protecting their prisoner.  Altering her character to being an active valuable asset to the team would have made the movie just as good.  Making her some moral SJW was the only negative of this movie.,0,0,906 Sparky,G8tlEcnrGnU,0.013020833333333336,2019-03-25 11:00:38,False,False
