And, all the conversations he had with Ruth there made it magical (even if it was just his delusions). The car catching fire makes it seem like Ira just gets into an accident that night and they rescue him a few hours after. Probably, meaning no meeting's with a Young Ruth. Sophia met Luke outside of a party at a restored Barn. She never mets up with Ira prior to coming to his rescue (with Luke). From the trailer it looks like Sophia has an office job instead of being a Sorority College Student. I'll still watch it, however.
