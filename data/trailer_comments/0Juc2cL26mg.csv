2019-03-03T16:51:51,"Personally I believe that the supernatural may indeed be present at the Winchester House, however I also believe it's nowhere near as bad as the movie portrays.  You can never trust most movie makers with the facts. They will always obscure the true story behind  exaggeration and sensationalism.   At the same time I understand 2 lines from the movie. Helen Mirren saying 'You leave my family alone.' and 'Your anger will never defeat us.' My own family dealt with the supernatural for almost 20 years where I spent my early childhood. A number of these encounters involved physical violence.  In the end, the supernatural is a touchy subject when it comes to film portrayals. And many times the facts end up distorted or completely fabricated for the sake of 'thrills'.",0,0,Riley Williams,0Juc2cL26mg,0.03070175438596492,2019-03-03 16:51:51,False,False

2019-03-25T03:58:20,"Honestly I hated the political agenda of this movie that even infected the representation of Sarah Winchester. If you read this:  https://www.prairieghosts.com/winchester.html you'll see a section that mentions that she specifically built it as a maze out of her chaotic improvisational planning methods and to keep the spirits of evil murders and law breakers who had been killed by a Winchester rifle confused.  She was stupid rich and had been lead into some evil occult using hysteria by the reliance on a medium.  I'm not saying that it's not possible or even likely that she invited one or two things into that house or that she could possibly be one haunting it, but she also blamed the great earthquake on the spirits, and I've never in my life even heard a rumor that suggest ethereal beings and lost souls could perform such a feat. I had to go out of my way to find somewhere to complain about this, simply because I hate historical revisionism and bss aackwords political agendas shoved down my throat in what otherwise was a decent movie.  Just drop that nonsense of how boom sticks are bad, rather than the broken world we inhabit with other broken people who are all capable of great and/or terrible things Winchester Lever Action rifles saw use in the Civil War on the Union Side, and primarily as a hunting rifle people needed in order to be able to eat. Factory farms weren't exactly a thing until the mid 20th century. Farms existed, but if you wanted a steady supply of protein for large populations someone was going to have to hunt. Lorenzoni repeaters had been a thing since around 1660, Revolvers since at least 1597, and bows/arrows, spears, clubs, and knives have been used far earlier than that.  I only have myself to blame for getting peeved off by that ""inspired by a true story"" sticker getting slapped on there. When I was a kid I was too apathetic and lazy to actually dive into the history books and learn about the real events that inspire such films, and rather than realize that inspired usually has an invisible ""loosely"" following it, I actually accepted it as fact and let it change my perception of world when they really shouldn't.  I feel like more than ever the majority of people aren't growing out of that same state my mind inhabited as a child, and I have this overwhelming desire to call out such things when I see them because I've know too many naive people.
