2016-02-16T23:16:01,"""Everybody's worth saving.""   Ugh, shit like this makes me cringe so hard. Can we _for once_ have a movie, book, etc. where not _everyone_ is saved? If works of fiction like these come without consequence in finales that are supposedly meant to be the most intense in their lineup, it inevitably becomes so predictable and boring.  *[SPOILER ALERT BELOW]*  Yes, and while I haven't read the book, I'm aware that Tris dies in Allegiant; but still. I'm going to generally assume that most of the people (if not all of them) in the story went and got a happy ending without any real repercussions involved (save for Four's grief over Tris' death), right? For God's sake, at least have a sizable amount of people die during this ""Genetically Pure/Genetically Damaged"" war or make it so the end result did not create a perfect system.  *[END OF SPOILER]*  To be perfectly honest, I'm getting so sick and tired of such frequent ""good guys win"" or ""perfectly happy ending"" outcomes for (again) books, movies, etc. and would actually find them more tolerable as long as more ""imperfect"" endings are used. If you want an example of what I'm talking about, just have a look at the ""Legend"" YA trilogy by Marie Lu. Great series overall, and while it's finale is ultimately a heartwarming one, it's not fully upbeat and ""fluffy"", either, and has an element of glumness to it. There's all sorts of deep conflicts involved in said trilogy that most other YA novels do not implement in favor of a more flawless kind of structure.  Anyways, my rant is now over; have a lovely day, everyone. And for those who are anticipating this movie's release, I hope you guys enjoy your watch.",0,0,VideoGameLova1,Gvq6cMtT5nA,0.19767711962833914,2016-02-16 23:16:01,True,True

There was no running across red deserts and the use of these sophisticated laser guns neither was there an invisible wall, which would only exist in a fantasy world....and this book is NOT supposed to be some fantasy world! It's supposed to display a normal world that we live in, none of this crazy ass, futuristic technology. There was no flying car thinys....there was trucks. And they drove in a truck to an abandoned railroad, NOT an invisible wall. The Bureau of Genetic Welfare isnt supposed to look like what everyone imagines a building in a future world would look like, its supposed to be a normal building that used to be an airport. They are ruining the simplicity of the book. Why are they trying to display the story in a futuristic world? Because it did not. Sure, the story is something that will most likely never ever happen to our world today, but that doesn't make it a futuristic story. Seriously? And, in the book, Tris didnt even know what tablet-like devices were, like the one that David gave to her to read her mother's journal and now its all about the technology and like she already knew all about it. And then the Part 2 name change to Ascendant? Like what the actual fuck??? Why cant they just do Allegiant Part 2? They are ruining the books by doing this. Its almost like they are disrespecting them, because the books are very well written and i respect them as super good books. In fact, so good that i have read the whole series over three times. I am obviously still going to see this, since im a hard core fangirl over it.

It kind of sucks when your favourite character gets 0 importance.  Insurgent was a bad adaptation of the book but an okay movie if you don't think about the book. They didn't focus on anyone except four and tris.  Allegiant is also gonna be really different, because 1) The books don't have enough going on in them to be split into two movies. 2) The trailer looks different. 3)Insurgent was different too.  I'm just hoping even if it's different it's good because insurgent was a disappointing adaptation. And I hope we get more of Christana at the least because all hope is lost for Uriah.
