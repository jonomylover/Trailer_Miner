They kinda tried to break it with Infinity War, but we all know deep down that a second part of Infinity War is gonna undo everything so it doesn't really matter. DCEU takes risks.

2018-11-19T22:13:07,"Cool trailer, but I wish they hadn't shown so much, for example, with as much as they have shown in trailers, they easily could have very easily not shown Black Manta without any loss in the quality of the trailer, but of course it would have been a great reveal when people see the actual movie.  I am keeping my fingers crossed for this one, not only did I love Aquaman when I was a kid, but I've been a fan on Jason Momoa since he joined the case of Stargate Atlantis, but I'm afraid that they might be going for broke and trying to squeeze so much into this first movie that it ends up crippling it. I mean just from the trailers we see how Aquaman's parents met and fell in love, him as a kid in school, him training to use his powers, face off with Prince Orm, his face off with Black Manta, a giant undersea battle set piece (maybe two, hard to tell from the footage) not to mention panels taken directly from the Trench series of comics and I'm not sure how they are going to include all of this without either shortchanging all of it, or making the movie 4+ hours in length.",0,1,John Patz,2wcj6SrX4zw,0.07320833333333332,2018-11-19 22:13:07,True,True

It seems they're gonna manage to work it in by having both be examples of the xenophobic extremism Aquaman's trying to stop, so at least we're able to get that dichotomy figured out. Willem Dafoe seems like he's having fun, so good for him. Shame is, he's at this point definitely never going to be the Joker of the DCEU. Which actually is kinda sorta fine by me; I haven't really been all too excited about the DCEU, so I'm a little relieved that they wouldn't have the hypothetical brilliance that a Dafoe Joker would be in it.

As of right now he does not have a new contract, however with that said both Henry and his agent have commented on Twitter about his staying with the Dceu and the fact that his agent described him as still having ‚Äúhis suit and cape hung up in the closet‚Äù Henry doesn‚Äôt have. New deal yet but he is very much still Superman. DC films is moving forward with birds of prey and batgirl and supergirl films so realistically it doesn‚Äôt leave room for Superman film for a while. Aquaman is coming next month both Wonder Woman and shazam are going through reshoots and the joker is filming now. Birds of prey is still casting and the studio is looking to film the flash in spring 2019. No word on the Batman other than Ben Affleck is most likely gone amid his recent issues.

2018-11-22T14:53:47,"There were tons comicbook companies, graphic novels, fictional magazines before Marvel and DC...      Most of the so called original characters DC fan boys claim to be original are all copies of other sources.. let me give you some of the list..  1: *Batman* is a copy of *black bat*(tony quinn),shadow(1930),zorro and bat whispers).  2: *Superman* is a copy of *Gladiator*(1930,by Philip Wylie).The orginal superman wasn't flying btw.  3: *G.lantern* and his corps are copies of *lensman*(1937-by edward elmer smith).  4: *M.manhunter*, *red tornado* are copied from *Aarkus*(vision-1940,marvel)  5: *cyborg* is a huge *Deathlok* rip-off.  6: *Aquaman* is a copy of *Namor*.  7: *joker* is copied from *gwynplaine*(the man who laughs-1928).  8:  *Timberwolf* is copied from *Wolverine*, Timberwolf got his healing ability in 1994 at Zero Hour reboot and he got his claws in 2004 at Threeboot.Originally, Timber Wolf was superhumanly fast and agile, but when the serum changed him into a wolf-like lycanthrope, he gained claws, enhanced senses, the ability to heal quickly from injuries, and superhuman strength. As a byproduct of his wolfen form, he is often prone to outbursts of savage fury.. To long story short DC turned timberwolf into Wolverine after Wolverine came out..( I guess DC tried to make people think that wolverine is rip offs)..  9: Both *antman* and *atom* are copies of *doll man*(quality comics-but dc bought them in 70‚Äôs-80‚Äôs).  10: *Solomon* Grundy is copied from *hulk*, Solomon Grundy came before hulk but if you do some research you'll find out that DC made Grundy look like Hulk after hulk became popular.  10: Both *elongated man*, *plastic man* and *mr fantastic* are copies of *thin man*(marvel-1940).  11: Both *green arrow* and *hawkeye* are copies of *arrow*(by Centaur Publications.-1938).  12: Bane (1993) copied from Crossbones (1989).  13: Black Lighting (1977) copied from Electro (1964).  14: Lobo (1983) copied from Wolverine (1974).  15: Raven (1980) copied from Phoenix (1963).  16: killer frost(1978 )copied from iceman(1963).  17: Static shock(1993) copied from shocker(1967).  18: Black Racer (1971) copied from Siver Surfer (1968).  19: Black Spider (1976) copied from Spiderman (1962)  20:Bumblebee (1977) copied from Wasp (1963).  21: Enchantress (1966) copied from Enchantress (1964) (Marvel).  22: Imperiex (2000) copied from Galactus (1966).  23: Killer Croc (1983) copied from Lizard (1963).  24: King Shark (1994) copied from Tiger Shark (1968).  25: Suicide squad [59's wasn't a villan group ] (1987) copied from Freedom Force (1985).  26: Swamp Thing (07-1971) copied from  Man-Thing (05-1971).  27: Commander Steel (1978) copied from captain America (1941).  28: Atomic skull (1976) copied from Ghost rider (1972).  29: Doomsday (1992) copied from Hulk (1962).  30: Guardian (1942) copied from captain America (1941).  31: Red rocket (1987) copied from IronMan (1963).  32: lord Havoc (1990) copied from Dr.Doom (1962).  33: Dreamslayer (1990) copied from Dormammu (1964).  34: Tracer (1990) copied from sabertooth (1977).  35: Gorgon (1990) copied from Doctor octopus (1963).

2018-12-05T09:47:38,"TL;DR Captain Marvel trailers are seriously whack so far.   Captain Marvel really needs to deliver a trailer like this to get people on board. The CM trailer 2 just was lacking in so many departments that this trailer epicly succeeds in. The music in CM trailer 2 sounds way too basic and generic and doesn't convey the message Marvel is trying to sell, this top secret heroe(heroine) who was there ""first"" and remained shrouded in mystery for decades, someone who is top 3 as the strongest heroe out there, a character who lays the foundation for a lot of what the MCU is and has become. And that has me worried that the film is going to have a underwhelming score. Music is important for these kinds of films seriously.   She's being hinted out as the reason and the inspiration of assembling the Avengers, the reason behind Nicks quote """"I am Iron Man"". You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet."" Carol Danvers is what he referring too.(Along with Pym and Steve). She is being hinted out as responsible for Phil Coulsons Iron Man 1 quote in ""This isn't my first Rodeo, Mr. Stark."". She's pretty much being designated as the origin story of the MCU and yet what they've illustrated so far has none of the weight of that arc.    Two trailers and yet the film remains typical. When it isn't suppose to be typical, it's suppose to be epic, of grand scale, revealing. The plot of the film is one of Marvels biggest and most famous story arcs, the Kree-Skrull War/Invasion and yet it's looks sidelined or secondary. Instead focusing too much on origin story(which really is attention grabbing no more). You might say but Aquaman does the same, but it doesn't in many ways, Aquaman has a lot of intrigue beyond being a superheroe because it's based on real legend/mythos and lore. Poseiden, Trident, Atlantis, etc you know stories tied to Gods and Olympus. And Atlantis is basically uncharted territory in film so it offers something newish and unique. Captain Marvel doesn't have that kind of hook because there is no more substance beyond her being a superheroine, nothing iconic for the audience to attach too. it's a film and plot focused on mystery and yet has no mystery aside from how was she around if she's never been heard of? And where has she been all these years? The marketing focuses too much on HER being the First Lady of the MCU and being a female superheroe when it kind of falls flat because we got Wonder Woman from DC, we've had Black Widow and we got The Wasp. It's not unique/different no more, has no hook.    The marketing should be focusing on what is fresh and intriguing and that is the Kree-Skrull plotline. This is suppose to be BIG and feels so small. There's so much origin to many of the elements of the MCU, this is a film with so many connections to so many characters across multiple franchises and again the volume of that is not being emphasized enough. We got Ronan The Accuser, Korath The Pursuer and the Kree not under Thanos control yet, the film even throws another curveball by making the Kree apparently good guys? Noble Warriors Heroes? So how do they go from that, to the cold and evil beings under Thanos control? We got Nick Fury who has yet to lose his eye and apparently the story behind that will be touched on, we have a rookie Phil Coulson and we have the Skrulls invading earth by impersonating humans of average and high status. I get that the film doesn't want to reveal too much about the Skrulls since a big part of the films identity is the mystery of their stealth invasion, but the marketing needs to convey all the other important and attention grabbing elements and it doesn't and instead focuses on something that isn't working and that has been done already.    Another bomb that the marketing is dropping with this film is the trailers focus on Feminism or female empowerment. I'm sorry but how many guys flock to theathers to see chick flicks that aren't comedies? Not many. Relying on the female demo doesn't produce numbers. Only very few films can achieve success marketing towards girls/women and relying on them and those are films that are either event films or based on big properties. Like Twilight, 50 Shades, live action Disney princess films etc etc etc. There's too many films that have marketed themselves to a female audience that ended up being their downfall, this is why a lot of female centric films now rely on trying to market themselves towards the male demo, because boys and men are the ones who flock to theaters consistently, who are the ones primarily making these films money. Even Wonder Womans marketing had little focus on Feminism or female empowerment and instead just showcased her as just another bad ass heroe, they didn't treat her like she was different, which is kind of the whole point of equality. The marketing made sure to grab the male audience attention and it's not until you actually see the film where you see all the deeply sown female empowered themes and messages.    Again there's too much marketing on what's not interesting ""oh look a superheroe but she's a GIRL!"" and not enough of all the stuff that is interesting, Ronan, Korath, Skrulls, War, Invasion, Nick, Carols amnesia/brainwash and a pre-Thanos dominated Kree. Another ball the marketing keeps dropping is the lack of practical and grounded action sequences, everything is super CGI based and rarely can a film grab a casuals attention relying on character driven CGI spectacle because it's harder for the audience to immerse themselves. Films that have super CGI based action pieces have elements of practicality and groundedness. The Matrix, Terminator, Sin City etc even all Avengers related films have Cap, Hawk, Widow etc to ground the film. Iron Man has a lot Tony or uncgi villains like Whiplash, even when we get Iron Man he's usually defeating human characters who fight him in a practical and grounded manner, shit Iron Man 3 had a whole 3rd act that relied on Tony and Rhodes fighting suitless. Point is CGI based action sequences need a level practicality and groundedness to balance it out. If not you get things like Warcraft, Sucker Punch, Justice League etc that were over-cgied. And only few films can bring in audience with CGI being the main draw and those are films that were special and groundbreaking that it had to be seen, like Avatar, Inception, Doctor Strange, Planet Of The Apes etc.    Lastly Brie Larson. None of the trailers have shown any range to her acting abilities, none of the trailers have shown personality to the character beyond ""i'm confused"". The moment in trailer 2 for CM where she and her bestfriend and comrade do the Shaka/Hang loose sign to eachother was very dope and illustrates and says a lot and there's not enough of that in this marketing, the trailers lack soul. Even the template of the MCU is severely lacking in these trailers, we only get Nick playing with the cat at the end as the only fun/funny moment. Thor, Spiderman etc oozed fun and funny moments yet CM lacks.   Every box that Aquaman checks (Music, action, fun, laughs, soul, plot, character depth etc) Captain Marvel misses.   And to the defenders of the trailers so far, y'all need perspective. I've seen many Brie Larson films, I personally know she can act her ass off and can portray many tones and I've read the comics but guess what the average film-goer aren't familiar with neither Brie Larsons acting ability or the source material. That's what the marketing is for to get people beyond you or me interested in the film. The ""don't judge based on a trailer"" mantra isn't going to change anything and does little to change the average film-goers mind. Shit i'm a fan and yet i'm severely underwhelmed by Captain Marvels trailers and if wasn't for me being in the loop with the character and the actress I would probably skip it until word of mouth got out.   Marvel needs to take a hard look at what's being said about this films marketing and how are audiences beyond the hardcore Marvel fans and MCU narrative dedicated are reacting to it. It shocking to see the same studio who gave us Thor 3, Spiderman HC and Infinity War trailers that check all the necessary boxes epic music, intrigue, character, laughs, fun, stakes etc deliver something so subpar. Just get the marketing team behind Infinity War to work on this films promotion, LIKE seriously why the fuck is this shit so concerning. Idk this is so unlike Marvel that it has me scratching my head and a bit worried the film won't deliver on all it's promises. This film feels so phase 1 MCU and that is not a good thing in todays landscape. *Fingers crossed* to being wrong.

I think Mamoa is neat in this role. The fact that  Mera is actually his companion in the movie and not a love interest  that's just there where we need schmaltzy scenes, and gone when the  action starts, is helping a lot. It helps to add a great dynamic between their relationships. The action is some of the best superhero stuff  I've seen done in live action. I could say it gives Man of Steel and  Infinity War run for their money. I did not like the cheesy usage of pop music in couple of scenes. Not a fan of that kind of music.

They spent night together and get a baby boy after 2 month as fish gives birth in 2 months. Then one day a storm comes and they both get drowned into it, while baby get saved at sea shore and a couple raises him as their kid. Eventually as time goes, kid gets to know that he has got some unusual power with which he can speak to water animals and even water cannot drown him. Also powers are fast swimming and can actually take out water from mouth anytime, because his mother was princess of water world which is Aquaworld. He finally goes there and comes to know that his parents are alive and aquaworld is in danger because of crocodile's attack.  Interval  As he fights with it and becomes the AQUAMAN of the Aquaworld. Then Aquaman tries to take connect this Aquaworld to real world outside on land but US army captures all Aqua creatures and experiment on them. Then we come to know that without water they do not have any powers. So aquaman goes to Atlantic ocean and gathers all sea animals and take all the water to this world to save aquaworld. Aqua world is saved and water is taken out from city as Aquaman saves humans as well. Then comes the twist we see the father of Aquaman makes a deal with US president and Kills Aquaman from behind.

Made Aquaman (generally the butt of all jokes) to this character you are rooting for    Con's:  Some jokes missed the mark (progress still as some were great)  A soundtrack or two felt out of place (rest were placed well)    Overall: 8/10, Definitely the right direction.

It is as predictable, cliched, corny love-storied as any 'epic' flick should NOT want to be. (Hate the total knockoff of the Black Widow character) Speaking of corny, I like how DC films are attempting to follow Marvel's lead in squeaking in those one-liner jokes, but c'mon??? There's more eye rolling here than a teenage girl slumber party. However if you go in there with the mindset of seeing a parody of a superhero movie, then you will find this flick quite hilarious.

2018-12-21T09:54:27,"Just saw the movie. (A very honest review) First half was disappointing with awful storytelling. Nicole is awesome. That aquarium scene is badass. But the chase scene in Italy, it was disappointing because of the pathetic background music. The script really could've been better in the first half. When Mera takes Arthur in her ship, the VFX didn't really impress me at all, not because it was bad, it's everything but bad, but because the story, those moments weren't at all compelling, engaging for the audience that I didn't even feel like I should appreciate those great effects. The first half barely impressed me. There were some fun moments. It's watchable.  The second half is like a whole different movie. My goodness!!! Right after they go to the trench for the Trident, the movie is gold. Perfect. The story, all the moments are engaging, compelling, you're thrilled to see every scene. To see Arthur meeting his mom, to see King Atlan, to see Arthur getting the trident, to see him in his fucking suit. That suit is a piece of work. The suit is fucking awesome. No character in the comic book movies has a suit that looks so good and so badass at the same time. No character has that. And everything after is awesome. Literally everything. The 3rd act/climax is the biggest and the best of all Superhero movies (Marvel and DC both). I literally wanted to jump off my seat. Arthur was so freaking badass. They legitimately made Aquaman look cool, like the coolest hero in the big screen in this climax. This is the vibe the superhero movies should give. And the CGI effects in the final ORM vs King Arthur fight. HOLY FUCK!!! It was like that scene was taken out from some epic video game with great graphics. And in the end, when Aquaman swims above and floats in the air, that's like the coolest thing I've ever seen. That was fucking badass.   This movie is big. This movie is ambitious. It isn't perfect, but it's fucking awesome. Almost all the time, the superhero movies have a disappointing climax. This movie has the greatest final fight of all time. 7/10 from me. I don't believe Aquaman wasn't nominated for the 2019 Visual Effects Oscar. They did watch the movie in 2d? Black Panther and Ant-man got nominated instead?

Making Batman killing around people was a heinous crime from Snyder. He killed the Batman for its hardcore fans. Only some morons, Snyder buttlickers would find Batman breaking his only rule to kill goons 'cool'. It's everything, and perhaps only thing he stood for when he decided to wear the cape at 1st place.   SS - Hot mess, still enjoyable viewing if you don't take it seriously.   WW - Holy mother of god it was amazing. Perfect storytelling, screenplay, character development, tone, decent fight scenes, and important to women (and men, too) for what it stood for. Pulling off the mythological aspect while keeping it so grounded wasn't as easy as one would imagine.  JL - I wish it never happened. I wish they hired someone complacent enough to direct this film instead of someone who had to be fired during production. Say what you wiill about JOss, I'm not his fan, either, but he pulled off 2 Avengers films. Zack was yet to make a film that majority could like. It was destined to fail, it didn't fail due to Joss no matter what Snyder trolls tell.  Aquaman - Absolutely bonkers of a film. I loved that it distanced itself from the mess of a Snyderverse. I also loved how Wan went full into details with this one, no holds barred. Turning it into a great fantastical, underwater adventure instead of restricting it to boundaries of a superhero film, it goes beyond and then some. I definitely can't wait for sequel as I couldn't get enough of it, and the fun I had. It's not perfect, but it's still freaking awesome.

In the start of the movie, Aquaman took a Kornet rocket to the stomach (and yes the rocket exploded), and after a few seconds he said ""ow"". Ow is generally said when someone gets a small injury. So assuming ""ow"" for a regular human is tripping, and ""ow"" for Aquaman is taking a rocket to the stomach, we now know that Aquaman is about 3,000x stronger than a regular human. This also means a human can take 3,000 trips at once and Aquaman can take 3,000 Kornet rockets at once. 1 Kornet rocket penetrates 1.2m of steel, 3,000 rockets penetrate 3,600m (3.6km/2.23mi). This means that Aquaman can safely destroy 3.2km/1.98mi of steel, at once, without risking his life. And I know that there was another theory going on that Gru could weaponize his dick, but let's assume Aquaman's dick is as powerful as the rest of his body, as the rocket that was shot at him at the start of the movie was only about 1ft away from his penis.

The action is so incredible, camera work o point, just gonna say that the third act is so mindblowing, holy moly.  The structure of the movie is fast paced, specially in the begining.  Outstanding music composition by Rupert Gregson-Williams, very unique.  Movie has lighthearted tone, some jokes land, others feel forced  Connection to previous DC films is kinda wanky, events are mentioned, other stuff contradicts, but movie stands on its own which is the important part.

Like, they'll always mention how Aquaman is not for everybody, or has flaws, or didn't hit it out of park for everybody every single time- as many times as they can even though if they enjoyed the film, even if majority enjoyed it, but they will never mention those things about Marvel films. Some of them will even call Thor: Dark World a great film. Do you guys think every single Marvel movie hit it out of the park for every single fan? If that's the case, then why did I only like CA:TWS, IM, BP out of all the 20 films?    If that's not the case, then why not mention that not every people liked CA1,3 IM2,3, A2, Thor1,2, DS, GOTG2, SM:H, etc like you guys do with every DC film? Aquaman is about to hit 1 billion, it crushed Disney's Marry Poppins, and 90+ rated Bumblebee when nobody expected it, it clearly shows more people have liked Aquaman than most of MCU films, but hypocrites like John Campea and Collider douchebags will never mention it. Because it is DC, and not their favorite Marvel. Heck, they didn't even mention how people completely despised 1st Captain Marvel trailer. Almost as if they are too biased, or under contract to not speak anything about Marvel. Grow up, guys, and treat every movie impartially.    I didn't like MOS, BvS, JL, but I LOVED Aquaman.

Wonder Woman was amazing and gave me hope that there was still something good in these movies. But after seeing Aquaman, I was blown away. I have always admired James Wan because he is an incredible director in The Conjuring franchise and the other rest of horror movies. In fact, The Conjuring is one of my favorite movies. I had my doubts on him about this movie because the DCEU was doing incredibly horrible. When critics started giving their opinions about the movie a few weeks before it was released, some of them weren't good at all and I felt like the movie was going to suck like Justice League. I was about to literally not go see the movie because I felt it would be bad as well. But it was nothing like I imagined. It's extremely well done and amazing. But one of the things I liked about it was how they interpret gender roles. In Wonder Woman, we all know that Wonder Woman/Diana Prince is the hero of the movie and let's be honest, Steve Trevor is the damsel in distress. The movie did very well in portraying femininity of course. What I loved about Aquaman, is that they portrayed both genders equally. They made Atlanna a powerful character but without putting Thomas (Arthur's dad) in the damsel in distress position. And as for Aquaman and Mera, they portrayed their genders equally powerful. It's like they needed each other to complete the journey. Arthur wouldn't have made it without Mera, and Mera wouldn't have made it without Arthur. Each character has their own power that makes them powerful and equal.",0,0,Bruce Humphrey,2wcj6SrX4zw,0.23557692307692304,2019-02-03 15:10:42,False,True
