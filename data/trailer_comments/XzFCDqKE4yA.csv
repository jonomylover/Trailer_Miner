This did not just happen in London, it sparked off in other cities around the UK such as Birmingham etc.  Search it up: UK RIOTS 2011﻿  https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=UK+RIOT+2011&rlz=1C1DVCI_enGB510GB511&espv=2&es_sm=122&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=uxJFU8nsJtKy7Aae64HQBA&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&biw=1280&bih=695",0,0,IgnitionFilmsz™ | We are the change.,XzFCDqKE4yA,-0.09694444444444446,2014-04-09 09:26:02,True,True

That is talking about policemen, armymen, military officers, NRA members, armed civilians, emergency personel, etc.   In a matter of hours, long before the Purge ends, the whole country would be razed by civil war. Depending on the intensity of the conflict, and how prepared each faction is, mayhem would only scalate becoming more and more destructive by the minute. In other words, cities will burn in flames. Roads would be rendered impassable. Important builds left unattended would lay in ruins.   By the end of the Purge, every mayor city in the country would rack up damages in the billions of dollars. With every important institution severely broken, even unable to recover, the economy would plummet to the ground. With all kinds of professionals, and other valuable workers lost in the Purge, the remaining industry would have serious problems recovering.

I feel like there would be more general robbery and maybe riots but not crazy people with masks hunting people down for fun. And even if they were I doubt that people like that could last a year doing no crime and then go all bloodlust. Or maybe this is like the serial killers gay pride parade and they all come from all over the world to participate. I do really like the concept though even though I haven't seen it yet, so i can't judge the movie I guess. I like seeing the vendetta/ revenge aspect though cause I feel like that would defiantly be a thing and I'm guessing it wasn't really explored in the first movie.",1,0,Chey na,XzFCDqKE4yA,0.1547008547008547,2014-06-24 00:43:30,True,True

2014-07-08T02:05:15,"Well really none of it makes sense. Let's say that the government decides to make crime legal for 12 hours of the year. Since I didn't see any evidence of people not being able to exit the country, then why wouldn't everyone just leave? I mean, honestly, even if you didn't have a passport, I am sure you could find a way to get out of the country, especially if your life depended on it. Then those who are left in the country, would be the people looking to ""have fun"" and those who couldn't get out (which to me would seem like a very small number). Therefore I really wouldn't see the point of committing ANY crimes. The majority of people would be gone, and if you were someone looking to have fun, you would have to deal with all of the other psychopaths out there looking for fun too. I mean, it seems to me like it would be smarter to commit crimes on days OTHER than the purge. I mean, the point of crime is surprise. No one is going to rob from a home, when the residents can shoot you down with no legal reason necessary. And the ones who are NOT looking to have fun, but still couldn't get out of the country, could easily just drive (or walk) to an isolated landscape and hide. I mean, it is only TWELVE HOURS. It isn't like they would be able to find you or even know of you if you hid well enough.

2014-07-14T15:38:48,"I think these movies are fundamentally illogical, and here's why:   Would the average person just start committing violent acts during the purge just because they knew they wouldn't be put in prison? I'm not some kind of humanist who thinks people are good deep down, but this still seems really unlikely to me. Suppose that 5% of the population were morally capable of committing violent crimes during the purge; if the other 95% were well-armed, the bad people would be severely outnumbered. In fact, we probably wouldn't even know which people were among that 5%, since they wouldn't be stupid enough to try anything anyway. And who's to say that neighborhoods and communities couldn't hire trusted cops (or soldiers, or MMA fighters, etc.) privately to provide them security during the purge hours?    But let's suppose that some people still ended up committing violent crimes during the purge. They wouldn't be put in prison, but does that mean that their behavior would have no repercussions? I think it's likely that private companies would emerge whose sole purpose would be to investigate violent acts committed during the purge, kind of like a private court system. Maybe they'd be composed of retired or active detectives, judges, etc. After reaching a ""verdict,"" they would post the names of the people they found guilty on their website for all to see and would name the crimes committed. The ""convicts"" could then be economically ostracized. No one would hire them for a job; no apartment would rent to them; the electric, gas, water, and internet companies wouldn't provide them services; all the local stores would have their names and faces posted so the cashiers wouldn't serve them; etc. etc. And the businesses who did serve them would themselves face the ire of their customers.   Then maybe there would be other companies who would build apartment complexes specifically for these personas non grata, and would offer them a contractual arrangement whereby they would provide them food and shelter for x number of years, and in exchange, they could not leave the complex without permission and would do some kind of work for the companies who own the complex. It would be a prison system of sorts, but far more humane, and entirely voluntary (as it would certainly be preferable to starving to death in the streets).   By way of this purely non-coercive system of justice, you'd bypass the public court system entirely and would disincentivize violent behavior during the purge. ",0,0,Armin Tamzarian,XzFCDqKE4yA,-0.08904660154660153,2014-07-14 15:38:48,False,True

The actions that the U.S. American government usually does, it will not surprise me if there really implement a system like the “Purge” in the U.S. soon.  Oh and just the comments that you write here without thinking, you really think that nothing happened with them?  Exactly this comments are used from the government for study the people, for have your opinions and reactions to this movies and they will make profiles and statistics about that, to see where your limits are and to see what shit they can show you and do to you without your complain.  Well, when I work for example for the US government like a psychologist or a brain scientist, and the government ask me about my opinion when I read this comments here or the statistics, I will tell them very clearly. Mr. President, with most of the population from this country you can do anything you want, because the People are totally stupid and blunt and they are notice absolutely nothing, they are totally superficial and inwardly dead.  Movies are not entertainment for the people they are a distraction to the facts of real life and they have the capacity and the mission to act as opinion Influencing. Any movie that is made today is matched with whole Departments of psychologist and brain researchers, so that the movie met the right purpose in the population. A movie like this example could also be used to see if such a concept positively arrives at the population, without making it actually public, that you are really planning to implement such a sick concept in a country.  Before you write so many shit in the Internet, thing about that how many people and witch people gone read that and then better write nothing. Only write when you write you real opinion, what you really feel and write the bad things not even as a Joke.

2014-08-28T15:04:34,"Do you understand how the economy works? Everybody wouldn't be rich, it would just be a restructuring of the classes. If poor and middle class people die, with the rich being left, then that would incentivise companies to increase prices, effectively creating a new middle class from the lower upper class. The only way to counter this would be to hyper-inflate America's economy, which is also a terrible idea. Also, with the middle and lower classes decimated, many industries would cease to exist (until a new middle class was formed from the bottom of the upper class) such as mining, agriculture, manufacturing, education, office work. This would destroy many of the rich peoples companies, as they have no workers. There would also be huge costs associated with the clean up after the purge. Imagine the costs and manpower required to clear cities and towns of millions of bodies, and repair billions of dollars worth of damaged infrastructure. The emergency services would also be completely overwhelmed. Hospitals would be flooded with victims (Ever seen a hospital in a war torn country? America would look like that), and many doctors and nurses would have died during the purge. Insurance costs would also sky rocket, and many insurance companies may even refuse to insure you for purge related incidents. What about people in hospitals too, for instance some one in intensive care? because I am pretty certain no medical staff would risk staying in a hospital as they are prime looting targets considering the millions of dollars worth of drugs and high-tech medical equipment. Government spending would have to increase to deal with the replacement of this, and to deal with all the people now on welfare because they became disabled during the purge, or now need counselling due to emotional trauma. Taxes would likely have to rise. What if a fire started during the purge? That could burn out of control for at most 12 hours, and by the time fire fighters are able to respond, the blaze could be out of control, lasting for days. Imagine what would happen if a fire blazed uninterrupted for 12 hours in New York city, it would costs billions of dollars, and kill and injure thousands.   Crime would also not go down, because most crime is not a one time incident, it is a habit and can be affected by factors such as economic status. Don't you think crime syndicates would take this opportunity to smuggle millions of illegal weapons into the country, and further maintain their grip on communities through terror killings or extortion. What about culturally significant buildings such as museums, landmarks, and art galleries? Would America's culture be allowed to vanish overnight? Other illegal activities would also be allowed to occur. Imagine the vast amount of drugs smuggled in from south of the border unimpeded. Other countries or groups could launch terrorist attacks without anyone stopping them. The purge would allow criminal groups to become larger, and more dangerous. Businesses, especially small businesses would be cripples, as they may lose huge amounts of resources, or staff. This would be terrible for the economy as these business now longer exist, therefore they don't pay taxes and the employees and employers must now receive welfare money. The American stock market would crash, as people would not want to invest in companies so liable of falling overnight. Large companies would also likely have to pay extremely high insurance costs. There would also be a huge amount of police inquiries needed. You don't think people would just suddenly stop the crime once the purge ends? It would continue for at least another 24 hours. What about people who were murdered just after the purge? It would take a huge amount of police resources to try and uncover whether the action occurred during purge time.   The Purge would be incredibly inhumane, and would destroy America's economy, and society. ",0,0,iamGLAD,XzFCDqKE4yA,0.04224347190100615,2014-08-28 15:04:34,False,True

I would love to see The Purge mixed in with other movie ideas, Purge Fan Fiction Crossovers. The first one I'd like to see is one dealing with The Expendables, where they are caught in the wake of a new experimental weapon, and are transported from Earth Prime to the world of The Purge. There, they have to survive, and defend as many innocents as they can, before they can find their way back to Earth Prime. The second idea would deal with Batman, where he is hit by an experimental weapon, but instead of dying he is transported to the world of The Purge, where he must defend the innocent, and discovers that the Bruce Wayne of Purge Earth is evil, and becomes Batman only for the night of The Purge, where he hunts the poor using his gadgets and fighting prowess, and the Bruce Wayne/Batman of Earth Prime must fight and stop him, Bruce Wayne must battle Bruce Wayne! The third idea would deal with Black Widow and Hawkeye, where they accidentally trigger a new Hydra device, and are transported to Purge Earth, where they discover that Hydra agents are there testing new weapons on people, all under the guise of being people who are Purging. The Black Widow and Hawkeye must stop them, and survive the other hunter teams out to kill them! The fourth idea would deal with Daredevil and The Punisher, where they are transported to Purge Earth, and must discover how they got there, and survive long enough to find their way home! And finally, I would like to see the crew of The Serenity, transported back to Earth That Was, and must find the parts to fix their crashed ship, and survive the night against hunter teams.

They have to be ruthless and lack an ability to empathise so that no one else can stand in their way or hinder their progress. It speaks of the true identity of which these global elite have and the things they are willing to do behind the scenes to maintain their power and wealth.

Proverbs Chapter 1 Next >>  1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 2 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; 3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; 4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. 5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 6 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. 10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. 11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: 12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: 13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: 14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:  15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: 16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. 17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. 18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. 19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. 20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: 21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, 22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. 24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; 25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: 26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. 28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: 29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 30 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. 31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. 32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. 33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.  ",1,0,ellen crates,XzFCDqKE4yA,0.1310956790123457,2015-03-24 03:54:27,False,False

In nature, whether through disease, starvation, or predators, the weak are culled from the herd so that only the strong survive. Weakness is removed from the herd leaving it to be made up of the strong. Survival of the Fittest = Those who are fit/able to survive, do. Those who are unfit/unable to survive, do not.  In the case of ""The Purge: Anarchy"", weakness and strength are determined by wealth. The ""strong"" (ie: the wealthy) are able to survive due to being able to afford the means to do so. The ""weak"" (ie: the poor) cannot afford the means to insure their own survival and thus they do not survive. As a result, their numbers are thinned and a reduction in the population of the ""weak"" (ie: the poor) results in a reduction of crime and unemployment... thus, a healthier ""herd"" (ie: society).",0,0,Gary Robb,XzFCDqKE4yA,0.103125,2015-09-19 09:31:51,False,False
