2019-04-29T08:58:56,"This movie is so much more than a romantic interlude between an honest MAN and a single woman.  It's also about depression, family, fatherhood, longing, single motherhood, integrity, love, etc.  Without ruining the plot, one (out of the many) parts of the movie that really struck me to the point of shedding tears was how during a brief time Josh Brolin's character filled the void that was left in the boy's life:  Fatherhood.  I cried because I realize how unfortunate some people are that grew up without a strong father figure.  I have a cousin and a good Black friend of mine who sometimes remind me that they wish they had a father/father-figure around as kids. I can't even fathom the void and desperation they felt growing up.    I realize now how fortunate I am that my father (imperfect as he was) taught me things that some in society might find perhaps insignificant ; things like doing an oil change on the car, fixing stuff around the house, playing baseball, cooking with him on the weekends so that mom could relax and de-stress, etc.  As a teen, I honestly hated being dragged in the early morning to help my dad do an oil change on the car.  *However, I did not realize back then that my father was teaching me so many basic life lessons while working on the car and chatting about substantive issues such as relationships, love, responsibility, dreams, aspirations, school, etc.  More importantly, we were further bonding as father and son during those moments.   And that is what impacted me the most about this movie. It brought back a plethora of memories and emotions about my father.*  The kid bonded with Frank Chambers (Brolin's character) in such a short time because he was missing that father-figure in his life. In any case, I can honestly say that having a strong father (yes even strict) made me the man that I am.  It allowed me to navigate and better adapt to the time I spent in the military, it allowed to succeed in college and initiate a good career, and it made me strive to become a better person through discipline and action.",1,0,Veritas Est Lux,QOQL3Xi8dPE,0.18642857142857144,2019-04-29 08:58:56,False,False
