These movies are entertaining and have a great deal more depth than the action and comedy oriented sequences that fill the trailer. The heart of it is also about education and information, the comedy aspect is merely to bring the kids in. I am surprised PBS didn't try to make a serialized educational cartoon based on the Museum films. That is why I like Ben Stiller, he does these lovely movies you can bring your families to during the winter break and not worry about it being overly vulgar.
