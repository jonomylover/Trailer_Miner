For example, in the original, there's a sense that the organized society (albeit a failing one) still exists, with medical services, the police, fire department, etc, still somehow muddling through. In the intro to the Road Warrior, however, we learn in the intro sequence that the society has crumbed down due to wars over oil, and that the events in the original film were all part of that decay. A the movie progresses, however, we clearly see that the last vestiges of an organized society have all been wiped out. In Thunderdome, furthermore, for the first time there's a talk of radiation and nuclear armageddon and there's even a clearer sense of ""before"" and ""after"". Now, a franchise is rebooted, and from its trailers it looks like its' going to be a cross-over between Thunderdome and Road Warrior. However, I personally would prefer to see more of the original (1979) Mad Max world, with a semblance of a still-existing, albeit crumbling, organized society. Perhaps, the 2014 Australian movie Rover was more faithful to the original 1979 Mad Max film than the Fury Road, which obviously harks back at its sequels, will ever be.",0,0,mishimi,hEJnMQG9ev8,0.04861111111111111,2015-04-07 08:19:06,True,True

Being an Australian myself, i always jump at the opportunity to see awesome movies made by Australians and seeing trailers for this movie has sickened me quite deeply, seeing a Australian franchise whos characters were identifiably Australian has now been ruined to catour to an American audience that the original movie probably wasent targeted at in the first place. Its truly unfortunate that things like this happen in the film industry, i dont know what other reason there would be to have the characters be American other then to appeal more to an American audience, all i do know is that its going to lose some Australian fans over this.

At the April 30th, 2014 test screening in Burbank, CA. Director George Miller told attendees that the reason for a reboot was that too much time had passed between the last Mad Max film to do a sequel or a film set between, along with doing such would mean a plague of continuity issues and creativity restrictions. George also commented that he didn't want to do a ""remake"" as he had no intention on retelling a story already told. A reboot allowed him to bring the universe and wasteland 30 years up to date while keeping Max as the moviegoers remember him, a man with nothing to lose after the loss of his family"".  ""From Warner Bros. press release: ""Mad Max: Fury Road Seminal director George Miller returns to the post-apocalyptic universe he created three decades ago with the cultural phenomenon Mad Max. Tom Hardy reinvents Max Rockatansky in Mad Max: Fury Road, Millers extraordinary new take on the legendary character for a new generation of fans.""  ""The storyline borrows from the setup of the original trilogy, particularly from the second movie but in its own new universe. Set years after the new Max (Tom Hardy) lost his family during the early days of the societal collapse.

Been a fan of the series for 30 years since i saw the first 2 on video and part 3 in theaters at age 4.   Here are some reasons:   The first 2 were r-rated adult oriented gritty sci-fi action picks with style and class, part 3 was a PG-13 family film, fun with nice performance by Tina Turner if a bit watered down compared to the first 2 even it's not as bad as AVP or Robocop 3 or mediocre as Terminator Salvation.   I'm glad George Miller is back as director and they got a nice writer for this, although Mel will be missed but Hardy should be a nice replacement. I'm also glad it's back to the R-rated formula as we already had one PG-13 MM movie and that was 30 years ago as it was enough, i mean nice to see them go back to the adult oriented gritty formula of the first 2 classics. I mean we had R-rated hits recently like Kingsman, Equalizer and American Sniper proving there is an audience for these kinds of action films. Hell even Predators proved when it went back to the R-rated formula after the dismal AVP showed there can be love for an adult orienited r-rated series.   Plus some old school practical effects with new stuff mixed in and all that.",1,0,Johnlindsey289,hEJnMQG9ev8,0.12373737373737376,2015-05-09 18:32:14,False,True

George Miller the original director returns as the father of post-apocalyptic cinema. The textures and the colours of the movie maintain the atmosphere of the old ones. The action is smart and fast. You will be on the edge of your seat all the time. The designs of the cars are original as fuck. The concept artists and the VFX artists did a great job, an amazing one. The writting is very good. You wouldnt expect such an original screenplay and dialogue from a blockbuster but thats thanks to George Miller and his writters team. The stunts are amazing they did a hell of a job with the camera movements. The characters have each one their own arch. The acting is specific to this kind of world. The world created feels like poetry. Cinematography is punk as hell. Conclusion: 5 stars. A beautiful ride.",0,0,Senior Adrian,hEJnMQG9ev8,0.3420676691729323,2015-05-14 23:31:16,False,True

Haunted by his turbulent past, Mad Max believes the best way to survive is to wander alone. Nevertheless, he becomes swept up with a group fleeing across the Wasteland in a War Rig driven by an elite Imperator, Furiosa.

I love the marvel universe just as much as the next guy, but strictly from a cinematographic standpoint, Mad Max was far superior. Joss wheaten is a capable writer, but he is nowhere near a great visual storyteller. His shots are rather bland and not cinematically motivated. They may look ""cool"" because of all of the flashy cgi, but if you take them for what they are, they are nothing special. George Miller on the other hand utilized a lot of interesting film techniques in the movie. His manipulation of frame rate in the edit allowed for a unique rhythm in pacing. His use of a centered framing style helped keep the audience oriented and concentrated on the action. His use of color helped to differentiate the universe from a sea of bland desaturated post-apocalyptic wastelands in films. Miller showed a solid understanding of the craft of filmmaking and I think that is commendable. He was also able to create very entertaining and dynamic character arcs that showed lots of development (Furiosa finding out about her home, Nux's change of heart, Max's eventual willingness to help) without shoving the emotional moments down the audiences throat. He let these characters be defined by their actions, as they should be. I enjoy both films but Mad Max was a  quantifiably more artistic and cinematic.

Visuals? 10/10 without a doubt, they were amazing, specially in 3D, the fast paced car action in 3D were amazing, a movie like this should be experienced in theaters. Action? 9/10, repetitive at some points, but as i said, worthwhile Story? i can't rate it, considering there wasn't any story actually going on, the point of watching this movie is the visuals and action scenes. its about immortan joe, wanting to get back his female property/ or what ever they were considered to him, they escaped with furiosa and the action begins from here.

To me this feels like a more mature version of Mad Max but that may just be me. I compare the Movie The Empire Strikes Back-though at the time not as much CGI was possible, but I use that movie to judge on the full balance of humor, set pieces ect. That movie, just like Fury Road has the right feel it needs.What I mean is its fantasy but it dosen't feel cartoony. I think adults will be pleased.

I wish that I could rip out that part of my brain that remembers things. The lines were beyond corny. It had NO story. There were tons of instances that were just straight up retarded. I was so glad every time someone died because it was an indication that the movie was closer to the end. I enjoyed the commercials before the movie far more than the movie itself.

2015-05-25T18:05:40,"There come times in movie history where a genre defining film is created, something so magnificent and grand that it forever affects the films of the future. Mad Max: Fury Road is a film that your grandchildren will ask if you saw it in theaters, and those of us who did will be proud to tell our children ""yes."" The movie begins with picking the audience up and placing them in the universe of Mad Max: where packs of roving guzzoline seeking bandits and psychopaths dwell, killing all who oppose them, and where two headed, irradiated lizards are eaten raw without a second thought. The sheer deadness of the world is gorgeous, and the fact that they use very little CGI brings it home. When the audience sees the stunts, cars flipping, exploding, stuntmen being thrown from them as they careen into canyon walls, they see real people and vehicles. Too often has a overly digital set and stunts made an action movie a sterile pool of disgusting brackish water, and bland characters who are either immortal or unlikable only add to it. Yet, Mad Max is the opposite: Max and Furiosa are very mortal, and their peril is real. Max is strapped to the front of a car and driven around the desert while being used as a blood bag, and Furiosa comes quite near death on several occasions. The enemies are made human by the addition of Nux, a War Boy who joins the protagonists, and only serves the Big Bad due to a religious devotion instilled in him by brainwashing. The Five Wives are very human, and compelling, given varied personalities. The movie, despite being an action packed thrill ride, makes time for subtle character development along the way. And this movie is truly a nonstop action scene. Perhaps fifteen minutes of its almost two hour stretch were slow, and its constant adrenaline rush makes one near mad. Every single bit of it is George Miller's genius, and it is truly unusual in the times of shallow plots and characters in action, where stunts are fake and blows softened by the cutting of a camera.

But how could this be?  His Interceptor was blown up in Mad Max 2/ The Road Warrior. This could not of taken place before the Road Warrior because Max would not have had his car anymore since it was crashed in Fury Road..  In Thunderdome, he was an older character and would not made any sense, plus his Interceptor was long gone when Thunderdome came along with him riding a camel pulled vehicle.  Fury Road seems to be an alternate story to the Road Warrior as it would have been at the same timeline with Mad Max's character being at the approximate same age and driving his Interceptor out in the desert wasteland, but they could not have happened in the same universe unless Max found the exact same Interceptor that was destroyed in both films,",0,0,J Williams,hEJnMQG9ev8,-0.1784313725490196,2015-05-26 21:20:26,False,True

Max does thrash her ass in the movie so there is none of that over the top feminism you might be worried about. The action is insane and constant. It's pure chaos and anarchy that has a twisted logic behind it. At one point a guy on bungee cords is jamming out on a electrict guitar on top of giant war rig while motor cycles are jumping trucks and a giant fireball engulfs 10 cars.  The only complaint I have with it is there is virtually no rest for the constant anarchy and chaos. Little talking. But I have gotten used to that nonsense and I remember this is Mad FUCKING Max.

2015-05-31T17:55:00,"I'm not usually one for dystopian films but everything in the trailers was so amazing I had to go and see if with my boyfriend. Both of us loved it from beginning to end. Over 80% of the movie is real action and not CGI (which was mostly removed to erase wires, for Charlize's arm, etc.) so there were guys on moving vehicles at high speed doing acrobatics and shit for real which is terrifying and amazing!  Some people complained about how Max didn't appear to be the central character despite being titular. Max has always been more of a narrative voice. He's the guy who walks into someone else's story and has a part to play in it, but it's never all about him. He's our eyes and ears in this other world.  ~SPOILER WARNING~  And this was about so much more than 'The Wives'. It was about a war lord suppressing the people he was meant to be in charge of. Preventing them from getting the basic natural requirements to life like food and water. Keeping the plant life high above their reach and living above them as if he was somehow closer to the Gods. Promising them salvation and a place in Valhalla for serving him, which are things no man has control over. Exploiting their desperation for a better world to incite their loyalty.  So if you want to see the best action film of this year, with real character development (Nux, Furiosa, The Wives, Max) as their co-dependency evolves from a need to survive to genuine compassion for one another's well-being, exceptional stunts, villains who are oddly reminiscent of today's politicians in parts, and people who stand as equals regardless of their appearance, health, gender, and capabilities, then you HAVE to watch this movie.",0,0,Natalie Penna,hEJnMQG9ev8,0.20643678160919546,2015-05-31 17:55:00,False,True

2015-06-03T19:06:36,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen, although Charlize Theron was pretty good in it. Hell, it was pretty much her movie with Tom Hardy as a supporting cast member. The car chases were fun as always but we've seen it all before in the previous Mad Max movies. OK, the porcupine cars were unique to the series but that s about it. I was half expecting to see a helicopter of some kind join the chase, it was that generic.  Other reasons why was it so bad?  1. Ultra lame plot. What did it take Miller to come up with that? 5 seconds?   2. Tom Hardy is NOT Mad Max. Not even close. Not even for a single second did I think of him as Max. He did remind me a bit of of Harrison Ford in ""Force 10 From Navarone"". And if they ever did a movie about Han Solo's early years, he might be good in that role.  3. Lots of dumb\sloppy stuff. For example, the pass is blocked by a massive landslide and then, as if by magic, all of the rocks are removed on the return trip. Or the guy with the spot light randomly shooting in the dark despite having no clue how far ahead they were. Or hooking the trucks winch up to the dead tree and Max helps hold the tree up!!! Or Theron helping push the rig when it was stuck in the mud! HAHAHAHAAHHAAHHA!!!   The main good thing about the movie is Miller wisely staying away from too much CGI effects.Other than that, there's not much left to praise.

Ofcours the legendary epic car  wich became Icon of the series.  Vilans in MM1 MM2 weare so damn creasy you could not predict what they do, they weare so scary watcher was worried about main character. Peoples became worried in MM1 For main character and his family, in MM2 woried aboud Max, his car and his dog. Fury road main vilan  just do not egzist, and more he is spread for 4 characters wich are flat as table top and so rare on the screen you forget about them. The good main character Max............do not egzist either. Tom Hardy as  Max is not bad but is not greate to. Whole show is stolen by FURIOSA Charlise Therone about wich incident i was worried since i get know about her  angage in the movie.    I give you  primitive and simple pictures what G.Miller done with his movies.  MM1 was like tenage first love, strange time with head filled with feromons, and fealing like live in another world......and ofc the first virgin sex. MM2 was like  greate  one week fuck, action from start to the end holding peoples in greate pleasure and adrenaline. MM3 was like watichng porn star on the  small screan wanking to it double time.  MM4 Furiosa Road is like going to cheap burdel. To put dick inside cum on the face and walk out peing for it. No soul, no real pleashure, no fealings. Just nothing. Just poore loosing preashure but turning valve.  This is my opinion.

Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are badass in this movie. If this movie wins any award, I will be shouting ""OH WHAT A DAY! WHAT A LOVELY DAY!!!"" 2. Jurassic World- now that's a worthy sequel. You really can't compare it to the original series, because it basically ignores the other sequels. Even if it can't beat the original, it was fun and awesome. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were great. Awesome ending btw. 3. Inside Out- such an original and heartfelt movie that should be watched by plenty. It has superb animation (as always from Pixar), likable characters (Bing Bong is my favorite), and it has such creative writing. Thank you Pixar for not being disappointing like your Cars movies. Pixar is back on track. 4. Avengers: Age of Ultron- I thought it was good, but I still think Guardians of the Galaxy is the best MCU movie (MY OPINION!!!). Ultron was a cool villain, and I love the addition to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. If there's one problem, I wish it was darker and less repetitive. Still good none the less.

Building character sympathy toward mad max fell from the beginning when he first  left them behind and tried to run on his own.  since then I personally  hated madmax till the end of the movie ,,  unlike the old mill Gibson character. 2nd point is for the bad leader with the mask, as much as we and  the director  try to paint an ugly picture to hate this evil dude, if you look at it, he was only  chasing after his child (property). and notice he was trying to save the girl who mad max shot in the leg in the first place which cased her to fell and die. Another point is why were the girls running , i mean they could deliver the child and then run, they had luxury life, but notice they wanted hope (similar to the obama hope), meaning when we imagine hope universally ,  notice they broke free from the underwear with spikes... in other words this evil lord had brides that he didn't want them to sleep with other men, then placed a spiked underwear that they broke free from that was part of their hope. This is exactly the mindset of the U.S. forging policy. when they invaded Iraq mr Bush was worried about women in Iraq that couldn't vote :( so sad !!! Going back to the point , the film generated a negative sense of sympathy toward mad max, and although the evil lord looked as ugly as he did, at least some empathy was built toward he movie since he wanted to save his child and get him back... this was not intentional .. just my thoughts .",0,0,Grozny Entertainment,hEJnMQG9ev8,-0.2787584459459459,2015-09-09 15:29:28,False,False

It's inexcusable, and it's turning a lot of people off from this masterpiece, so I'm going to deconstruct all of their incorrect arguments for those who haven't seen:  ""There's no story and dialog/terrible story."" Sure, there's very little dialog and exposition, but that does not mean there is no story. Mad Max: Fury Road excels in visual storytelling, a unique and interesting form of storytelling which very few big budget Hollywood titles use. If you think there is no story, you simply aren't paying attention to the movie. While the overall story is fairly basic and predictable, the amount of depth put into the situations and the way they are woven together, as well as small details throughout the movie and references to Miller's other work, is so masterfully done that it overshadows all of this. Besides, a movie does not NEED to be complex to be good. I've seen the movie 3 times now and each time I notice a new detail I had never noticed before.  ""It's all just one long action segment/car chase."" ... And? Isn't that what you pay for when you go to an action film? Isn't that why the name of the genre is ""ACTION""? Take a look at the latest Fantastic Four, it did the exact opposite of Mad Max in terms of plot, backstory, narrative and build-up vs. pure, raw, exciting, intense action, and look at the difference in response between them. It's also masterfully directed, using a tracking technique where the action is always being followed precisely between shots. This was covered in the Mad Max Film Theory Video if you're interested in this technique, as it really makes the film much better than all the shitty action segments Michael Bay puts out.  ""It's feminist propaganda."" This is false. The want to free from oppression and sexual slavery from a brutal, oppressive dictator, as well as the idea of women being diverse, in terms of beauty, skills and character, and capable of being on the same level as men, is not exclusive to feminism. Really, it's an idea that all human beings who aren't scumbags should embrace.  ""The film is full of CGI.""/""The film is boring.""/""(Other Strange Generic Argument from someone with Insanity or a Meth Pipe)."" What are you talking about? Did you even watch the same movie? Did you too, like the people who say it has no story, just not even look at the screen for more than 5 seconds before declaring you were bored? Did you forget to take your ADHD meds today?  Alright, rant over. Seriously, this movie is one of the best action movies of all time. There's a reason it's being praised by everyone who has any sort of sense of what makes a movie good. it's incredibly entertaining and brilliant, unique yet familiar, and you need to watch it considering those points above.",1,0,Doctor Dankeston,hEJnMQG9ev8,0.10991114606786251,2015-09-24 19:31:16,False,False

This is like a future fueled by drug hallucinations and physical survival skills. This is where the movie excels.  When I saw those beautiful girls with Charlize Theron, I cringed. They look like fashion models. This movie is like a GQ photoshoot on steroids. Gorgeous to look at and fun to watch and rewatch. But I still think Mad Max 2 (The Road Warrior) is the best.

Max in the last 3 movies was a road warrior,  in MAD MAX he took out the bikers for killing his wife and child as sweet revenge introducing the V8 Interceptor, MAD MAX 2 the road warrior in search for fuel helps a community relocate from scavengers. MAD MAX beyond thunderdome, takes max into a city of violence, outcast from Aunty finds a lost tribe who he helps find the old world. This Fury Road comes down to a bunch of woman saving his ass from being killed, the main woman seems to have more balls than Max. The character choice to play Max was all wrong, and failed to deliver on Max true story. It was a movie based on one big chase, with clean looking cars instead of rusty old welded machines. I'm sorry but this is my opinion and as a collector of Mad Max memorabilia, knowing the movies word for word and a movie buff of the 3 trilogy films, and watching these films since 1980 this Fury Road was all wrong.",3,2,Zyridius,hEJnMQG9ev8,-0.14677777777777778,2016-12-10 07:33:54,False,False

Each and every character has a fully-realized story arc - not just Nux and Furiosa, but Max as well. To all critics saying the titular character was underdeveloped... just remember, he was the reluctant hero trying to survive when he realized by the end that he couldn't just walk away from a noble cause again. Not until his mission was complete. He began the film as a 'feral' reduced to being someone's blood bag... and ended it by rediscovering a part of himself lost along with the rest of the world he knew: a sense of empathy for others, a basic quality of humanity.

It was more about the Imperator Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron than the main character played by Tom Hardy. The original 1979 miller version was way better than this film, and Mad max's dead daughter haunting him throughout the film; was just creepy! I was surprised how Miller failed this film.Nevermind that in the original film Mad Max, was originally a police officer, fighting to maintain law and order in a nuclear apocalyptic Australia. Its storyline was weak, because it lacked story context, and lacked in introducing the characters into the film. It also lacked the vivational sensation of an action packed film, which was pretty with the CPG; which is the only thumbs up it will get from me. The only thing I hope is that when they come out with Mad Max wasteland; that Miller learned his lesson. I hope it is way better than fury road because if not it will be the death of Millers franchise. Mad Max Wasteland was set to be released in 2017.

His boil covered skin, the plexiglass armor designed to make him look physically fit, and the breathing apparatus all show us that his health is failing but he still seeks to appear strong and fit. And his power and greed is also shown in the movie. In a world where most have nothing he had two of everything. He possessed two chrome revolvers, and his vehicle the Gigahorse was made from two Cadillacs fused together. And unlike the rest of his fleet there's not a single spec of rust on his car.

2019-09-13T04:35:43,"Sort of OK film, but no where near the scores it got on review sites. A few interesting action scenes but world building sucks harder than a porn star. And when someone makes a film in an alternate world, world building is essential. And those OK action scenes were nothing so spectacular or breathtaking, just a bunch of scenes you'd expect from Michael Bay, lots of boom boom, that's it. How did the film get 97% critic and 81-85% viewer score, I have absolutely no idea. A mediocre stupid fun if you don't have better things to do, so hard 6 at best.   As for the actors, of 3 that you will notice in the film, Tom Hardy plays Tom Hardy in torn up clothes, Charlize Theron is bland and generic with only Nicholas Hoult delivering a somewhat interesting character. The rest are basically just extras.   If there is ANYTHING that you WANT to watch besides this, go watch it, skip this one. Return to it only if there is nothing else, you are bored and you want some very stupid fun action. Even if you want very stupid fun action NOW, go find some better ones for it, there are plenty.

I hope Miller gives us a crazy cool prequel to Fury Road or perhaps a prequel to Max first be coming a cop or a true sequel to The Road Warrior.
