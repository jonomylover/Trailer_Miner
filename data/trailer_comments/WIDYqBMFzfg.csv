She NEEDED him. Needed him to provide her with money, a home, stability, and routine so that SHE could. . . have children.  9. In a few years she will decide SHE CAN DO BETTER and she will seek a frivorce (frivolous divorce), blow up her family, take half of his property, more than half of his income, and most likely ALL of his children, and go out in search of the Brazilian helicopter pilot who, she has carefully ""forgotten"", didn't want to marry her in the first place but only wanted to pump and dump her!
