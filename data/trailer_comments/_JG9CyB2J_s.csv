Apparently people don't want to see something different. They just want to see the same thing over and over while great films like these sadly bomb. I thought the film was amazing and did not deserve to go unnoticed. I think more people should have gone to see it and told everyone about it. Everyone should have been aware of it.

2015-05-28T08:08:32,my sister and I watched this and didnt get too far. the movie was just amazing but we couldn't stand the shaking of the camera we felt dizzy half of the movie so we didnt get any chance to finish  it. Found footage movies doesnt make any sense at all overrated and not enjoyable too. gaves me headache af everytime I watched it unlike paranormal activity I know it sucks but most of the scenes runs steadily.
