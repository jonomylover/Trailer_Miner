Tim Burton is going to make this Dumbo a whole lot darker than I thought and I can't wait to see his pink elephant scene. This could even be darker than the animated version as people lose limbs in this version showing how truly dangerous circuses can be.

The scene of Dumbo and his mom  The atmosphere looks enough circus  From what I see, the mockery of Dumbo will be included in the film.  We will see Dumbo flying more time than in the original (although it was his characteristic feature, we all know that he did not fly until the middle of the third act)    Not so good things:  I have a feeling that the scene of the pink elephants will change A LOT. It seems that now it will be a circus act, but I hope it has the bizarre atmosphere of the original.

Casting human actors and making them the film's biggest stars, I think, violates a major theme of the original film - the theme that humans are often cruel to animals. Think about how unsympathetic the human characters - the ringmaster, the clowns, etc. - come across in DUMBO, and then think how sympathetic most of the animal characters are. The humans in the movie have to learn that the baby elephant has feelings and should not be separated from his mother just so he can be exploited - and, to their credit, in the end they do learn their lesson, and allow him to be with his mother again.

2018-11-15T03:20:49,"Again? We‚Äôre doing this *again* ?! Taking a classic story with adult messages and themes, and ruining it?  Just from looking at the trailer, I know I won‚Äôt be looking forward to this movie. Dumbo isn‚Äôt being featured in all of the scenes, and all we‚Äôre getting is human dialogue with the occasional shot of our hero. The children aren‚Äôt from the original movie, and we never see the mice do anything other than serve as a middle finger to everyone who loved the original for its characters and story.  The girl sounds uninvested and outside of the scene, like Emma Watson did in ‚ÄúThe Beauty & The Beast‚Äù. The little boy says next to nothing, meaning he‚Äôs going to just be there to distract us from the unconvincing cgi. Then there‚Äôs the adults whom we‚Äôre supposed to assume are our supporting cast, having subplots take place in the background of our heroes‚Äô journey.  Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong with the trailer: there‚Äôs not enough of Dumbo, too much dialogue, too many humans, and not enough visuals. The original movie‚Äôs a classic because it can bring tears to the eyes of viewers, young and old, without any words between characters. When Dumbo was on screen, he wasn‚Äôt being praised or kept up until he met his companion, who wasn‚Äôt against humor and had a distinct personality.  The thing about the original Dumbo‚Äôs that, while it wasn‚Äôt always silent, it didn‚Äôt have to rely on humans discussing unrelated drama to pan out the runtime and distract us from effects the actors aren‚Äôt even acting with.  It‚Äôs a reimagining, so I‚Äôm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and say that *maybe* , *just maybe* it isn‚Äôt being directed and produced by people who mistake ‚ÄúAlvin and the Chipmunks: the Squeak-el‚Äù as a masterpiece.  We got to see Dumbo flap his ears, not because he flew on accident and did so again to save his life, but because he sneezed when a random feather got stuck in his nose.....Excuse me, *WHAT* ?! Not only did you use the mice to tease us with the idea that we might get our second favorite mouse back, but you taunt us with the magic feather being *sneezed on* !   It‚Äôs like you want to say, ‚ÄúOh, you liked *that Dumbo* , well it sucks to be you because we‚Äôre the *adult version* !‚Äù The original one was a very sad movie up until that little elephant first flew and it was sad, not because we‚Äôre told it‚Äôs sad, not because we‚Äôre shown the scene that makes everyone cry, but because we got to see and love these characters.  We‚Äôve been thrown numerous characters to be blindly adored, with the tone of the trailer being uplifting before suddenly being heavy. Unfortunately, that didn‚Äôt work, because some of us actually know how to write and direct.  Seeing Dumbo fly shouldn‚Äôt have been involved in the trailer, because it gives away the highlight of the movie. Or, if it was *paramount* to show the little elephant fly, you don‚Äôt show *when he starts to learn* ! We could‚Äôve been hooked on the sight of a shadow on the ground before we pan up and see a baby elephant flying, but *no* you copped out of having a shot that holds up to just grab some cash.  Dumbo‚Äôs a baby elephant who got too much thrown at him at once, being bullied by children and losing his mother when she defended him. His companion could do little to nothing but try and fail to help, something that the kids aren‚Äôt going to do.  I‚Äôm not excited for this movie, not after seeing how my favorite childhood films are being turned into ninety minutes of soulless exposition and drama. There are no new stories, there never have been, but it‚Äôs what you do with a story to make it your own that matters and I‚Äôm not liking what I‚Äôm seeing because it isn‚Äôt a Disney film. What I‚Äôm seeing is the farthest thing from the creativity and passion that Disney instilled in children as they grew up.",12,8,Gavin Christenson,7NiYVoqBt-8,0.07377375449409346,2018-11-15 03:20:49,True,True

I mean yeah I know not a lot of people like the idea of remakes and I get it but come on! Doesn't the idea of seeing a more live action Dumbo's journey get you a little excited? I mean I'm a huge Michael Keaton fan so he's a huge reason why I'm excited to see this movie but I'm also looking forward to seeing what Dumbo would look like in real life! I mean I know it's mostly CGI but you know what I mean. I also like how they added a real villain to the movie since I don't think the original really had a villain since I don't think the ringmaster was really technically a villain. I feel like that'll help make the story more unique while still staying true to the original story.

I don‚Äôt think this generation is going to have a issue watching a classic movie that came out 30+ years ago. Just put it in HD and allow it to be downloaded. My generation was cool with it.

Not to mention Mrs. Jumbo is, by far, the best Disney mama out there. Not many Disney moms would flat out spank another child on the ass for making fun of her son, then go on a rampage in order to protect him.  Anyway, this film has _some_ potential, but Dumbo didn't need a remake. It was a great movie already, and ridding it of Timothy Mouse as a main character, the classic stork bringing the baby idea, Casey Jr., and the crows (as far as we know, they will most likely not be involved) will surely dispose of its charm. At least I saw the Pink Elephants, and ""Baby Mine"" looks like it will still be in the film. Sigh.   I wish Disney would listen to the ideas of its fans more often.

2018-11-15T07:42:27,Me Being One of the Biggest Dumbo Fans as a kid and still to this day. I don‚Äôt really know how I feel about this movie. Idk why Disney Is making Soooooooo many Live action versions of their originally animated films. One Main Con I have from what I‚Äôve seen from this trailer is that the animals don‚Äôt talk?? Like in the original film?. Dumbo Doesn‚Äôt talk of course but what about the crows and the mouse. Another Con I Have is that there are a Bunch Of Actors in this version. But why?? Some movies are better without so many actors. The original dumbo didn‚Äôt even have that many humans at all. But One Pro I do have from what I‚Äôve seen Is that The ‚Äú Pink Elephant‚Äù scene looks like it is making a return which I am Reallyyyyy pumped about!!  I‚Äôm hoping they add the Original or maybe a reprised version of ‚ÄúPink Elephants On Parade‚Äù.

It's truly an historic moment for Dumbo and for us fans and for Tim Burton. This new story of Dumbo has now shown it's more heart touching and amazing and everything so much that what we were expecting. Dumbo looks more realistic than ever before and the characters that are with him are super awesome with the surprise seeing Timothy Q. Mouse as a pet mouse which I didn't expect to see and Casey Jr, the circus train with a badass whistle and we get to see Mrs Jumbo in full detail as well as seeing how good Michael Keaton as the villain, V. A. Vandemere will be which I'm so excited for.  Dumbo's lullaby played once more and was powerful than ever that made me just as close to Dumbo than ever before for this is a personal reunion with my Disney childhood. I felt so hyped but also got caught in the moment of emotion.

While many of the visuals are spot on and the plot seems sturdy, I just think the clips of the kids were really dull and flat. The adult actors did fine from what I saw, it was just the kids. So unfortunately, it seems to me like it will repeat the previous mistakes in Burton's film, which is that a character trying to be more gritty and realistic than it's previous interpretation will ultimately suffer in personality and be too bland.  With that said, I do think this will at least be good. Tim Burton has done incredible work, and there's nothing to say that he can't ever do it again.

It‚Äôs an app I‚Äôve been using that gives you cash back on day to day purchases your already making. Basically how it works is they are having a special thanksgiving promo for every referral you get that links a debit card to their account you get 10 cash back. It‚Äôs not a scam, it‚Äôs a lot like ‚Äúibotta‚Äù or the Walmart apps that give you cash back as you go shopping. This, however, gives you a promo until thanksgiving that gives you $10 when your friends simply sign up and put their card info in (don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs secure). So, if you get 5 people to sign up, you make a quick $50, plus, when you sign up and put your info in-it gives you $5. Ive made quite a few bucks just by having my family sign up to help me out. They don‚Äôt need to use the app, just get started and put their info in. They‚Äôve made cash too, just by using the app when making everyday purchases.

2018-11-15T23:15:34,"The original animated Dumbo is perhaps one of the most important films of my childhood as well as growing up into an adult.  It was is the film that initially challenged me to strive to being a better individual and to soar over the obstacles laid before me no matter how great or impossible they presented themselves.  It is Dumbo that enthralled my imagination, captivated my heart, and enlightened my soul to understand what it truly means to be the best person you can be under the apathy of others.  It is not the grand artistic masterpiece that is Fantasia, nor the wonderfully crafted fairytale that is Beauty and the Beast, but it is a film that could do something just as impactful as any of those films I mentioned.   Because that was the magic of the Classic Disney Animated Films!   They are each special in their own unique way.  And Dumbo was that film for me as a kid and well into adulthood.  And this is what these reboots fail to understand or capture.  You can put the title in, you can put in all the right beats, you can put in all the nods to the original till the sun rises, and add all the flavorful twists to call it ""creative and fresh"", but at the end of the day these reboots will never ever be The Original Animated Classics.  I know that in the end this has no meaning nor impact cause it is to each their own, but for my own principles I cannot and will not see this atrocity of a film that insults the name of Dumbo",0,0,James J.M.S.S,7NiYVoqBt-8,0.34695767195767185,2018-11-15 23:15:34,True,True

I grew up with old Disney movies like Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Dumbo, Aladdin, and others, and while those movies will always be dear to my heart I won't hate these new versions simply because it's not what I grew up with. Kids these days hardly ever make it a point to go back and watch old Disney movies. I can't tell you how many of my little sisters friends from school haven't even watched half of the old classics. While I'm not stupid and know that part of these movies are for cash, I feel that remaking the classics has allowed the new generation to be appealed to. I've enjoyed the live actions made thus far apart from Alice in Wonderland even as a old Disney fan. Concerning this one I want to go see it partly because Dumbo is adorable, but also because I'm giving all remakes a fair chance as most of the time they provide new and pleasant material to the story.

2018-11-16T00:13:34,I don't usually like leaving negative comments. But part of the beauty of the original was Timothy's belief in Dumbo. A creature 1/100th of his size. Here it seems like you made him a cameo and replaced him with children like every other animal centric movie out there. I hope that Timothy plays a bigger role but it seems that you've lost what made Dumbo so inspirational.,0,0,Evie Rawlings,7NiYVoqBt-8,0.028571428571428564,2018-11-16 00:13:34,True,True

With the compliments out of the way the change that Dumbo is for the most part is taking the backseat due to him not speaking and focusing on other characters is somewhat disappointing.  And besides all that... WHY DID YOU BASICALLY SPOIL THE ENTIRE MOVIE IN THE TRAILER???? No need to go watch the movie i guess.  Elephant brought to a small circus that is bonded like a family, accident with a feather -> discovers he can fly, gets attention, mother taken and nothing is done, children making promise to reunite with the mother.  Later on the adult who could have done sth. feels bad and has a redemption in the final act. Along the story Dumbo looses the ability to fly due to his mother gets taken, can't preform, reunites with his mother and flies again THE END  Just saved you 2 hours of your life and the price of the ticket that you would've otherwise wasted.

2018-11-16T02:28:01,"This message has nothing to be with the video but is important for you. Jesus , the Prince of Peace, is the only One who can give us unshakable peace in a world of turmoil. As someone said, ""There will never be peace in the individual heart or at the peace tables of the world until the Prince of Peace reigns supreme in the hearts of men."" Jesus said, ""Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid""(John 14:27). He also said, ""Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest""(Matthew 11:28)My Friend: I am asking you the most important question of life. Your joy or your sorrow for all eternity depends upon your answer. The question is: Are you saved? It is not a question of how good you are, nor if you are a church member, but are you saved? Are you sure you will go to Heaven when you die?  God says in order to go to Heaven, you must be born again. In John 3:7, Jesus said to Nicodemus, ‚ÄúYe must be born again.‚Äù  In the Bible God gives us the plan of how to be born again which means to be saved. His plan is simple! You can be saved today. How?  First, my friend, you must realize you are a sinner. ‚ÄúFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God‚Äù(Romans 3:23).  Because you are a sinner, you are condemned to death. ‚ÄúFor the wages [payment] of sin is death‚Äù (Romans 6:23). This includes eternal separation from God in Hell.  ‚Äú . . . it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment‚Äù (Hebrews 9:27).  But God loved you so much He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to bear your sin and die in your place. ‚Äú . . . He hath made Him ] to be sin for us . . . that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him‚Äù (2 Corinthians 5:21).  Jesus had to shed His blood and die. ‚ÄúFor the life of the flesh is in the blood‚Äù (Lev. 17:11). ‚Äú . . . without shedding of blood is no remission [pardon]‚Äù (Hebrews 9:22).  ‚Äú . . . God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us‚Äù (Romans 5:8).  Although we cannot understand how, God said my sins and your sins were laid upon Jesus and He died in our place. He became our substitute. It is true. God cannot lie.  My friend, ‚ÄúGod . . . commandeth all men everywhere to repent‚Äù (Acts 17:30). This repentance is a change of mind that agrees with God that one is a sinner, and also agrees with what Jesus did for us on the Cross.  In Acts 16:30-31, the Philippian jailer asked Paul and Silas: ‚Äú . . . ‚ÄòSirs, what must I do to be saved?‚Äô And they said, ‚ÄòBelieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved . . . .‚Äô ‚Äù  Simply believe on Him as the one who bore your sin, died in your place, was buried, and whom God resurrected. His resurrection powerfully assures that the believer can claim everlasting life when Jesus is received as Savior.  ‚ÄúBut as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name‚Äù (John 1:12).  ‚ÄúFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.‚Äù (Romans 10:13).  Whosoever includes you. Shall be saved means not maybe, nor can, but shall be saved.  Surely, you realize you are a sinner. Right now, wherever you are, repenting, lift your heart to God in prayer.  In Luke 18:13, the sinner prayed: ‚ÄúGod be merciful to me a sinner.‚Äù Just pray: ‚ÄúOh God, I know I am a sinner. I believe Jesus was my substitute when He died on the Cross. I believe His shed blood, death, burial, and resurrection were for me. I now receive Him as my Savior. I thank You for the forgiveness of my sins, the gift of salvation and everlasting life, because of Your merciful grace. Amen.‚Äù  Just take God at His word and claim His salvation by faith. Believe, and you will be saved. No church, no lodge, no good works can save you. Remember, God does the saving. All of it!  God‚Äôs simple plan of salvation is: You are a sinner. Therefore, unless you believe on Jesus Who died in your place, you will spend eternity in Hell. If you believe on Him as your crucified, buried, and risen Savior, you receive forgiveness for all of your sins and His gift of eternal salvation by faith.  You say, ‚ÄúSurely, it cannot be that simple.‚Äù Yes, that simple! It is scriptural. It is God‚Äôs plan. My friend, believe on Jesus and receive Him as Savior today.  If His plan is not perfectly clear, read this tract over and over, without laying it down, until you understand it.Your soul is worth more than all the world.  ‚ÄúFor what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?‚Äù (Mark 8:36).  Be sure you are saved. If you lose your soul, you miss Heaven and lose all. Please! Let God save you this very moment.  God‚Äôs power will save you, keep you saved, and enable you to live a victorious Christian life. ‚ÄúThere hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it‚Äù(1 Corinthians 10:13).",0,0,Emmanuel Torres Davila,7NiYVoqBt-8,0.197867163700497,2018-11-16 02:28:01,True,True

It was already a little too far when they decided these kids would replace basically the other essential main character, little mouse guy.  Adding too much ""newness"" to CLASSIC stories always hurts exactly what makes them beloved stories.

2018-11-16T02:54:08,This obviously not the story of the original. In this humans seem to be the main characters and not the animals. On top of this the entire plot of the original was progressed when dumbo got made fun of by other animals. In this film the animals don‚Äôt talk and therefore non of the story would make sense if it went the same route of the original.

The best idea they can come up with is to not take chances and just go with a guaranteed audience strategy by playing us with nostalgia and fake enthusiasm.

Song of Solomon 1:5-6 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as black as the tents of Kedar, as black as the curtains of Solomon. Job 30:30 my skin was black upon me. Lamentations 4:8 my skin was blacker than coal. Isaiah 47:1-2 we had dreadlocks. Acts 13:1 I was called a nigger. Daniel 7:9 burnt bronze skin Revelations 1:13-15 hair like wool skin like burnt bronze. Song Of Solomon 5:11 My dreadlocks are black & bushy. Enoch was a pitch black Ethiopian. Moses married a black Ethiopian and passed for a black Egyptian and Pharaoh son. Baby Jesus, Mary, & Joseph fled to Egypt to hide. Jesus walked the desert for 40 days. Israel is on the continent of Africa. The real Jews were Egyptian sun-slaves and have always been black.  Acts 7:6 Then the LORD said to Abraham, ""Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. Deuteronomy 28:15-68.  Daniel 9:11 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him. Isaiah 42:22 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.  Jeremiah 17:4 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever. Isaiah 1:3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. Lamentations 1:3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits. Luke 21:24 They shall fall by the edge of the sword and be taken captives into all nations. Jerusalem will be trodden down by gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled. Revelation 3:9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.  Ecclesiastes 4:14  For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.  Isaiah 45:17 But Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.  Revelation 21:12 And The New Kingdom of Heaven had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.

Dumbo is shown to have friends and be able to fly FROM THE BEGINNING! This completely negates the central conflict of the original. Dumbo was ridiculed from day one for his unusual ears, and loses his mother because she is the ONLY ONE willing to defend him! It's not until after he loses everything, that Timothy Mouse feels sorry for him and helps him learn to fly which gives Dumbo the confidence to stand up for himself. And why have these two generic kids outright stolen Timothy Mouses's role? They seem to contribute nothing the he didn't do already.  I'm calling it now, this new film will be needlessly complicated and not nearly as emotionally impactful as the animated version.

2018-11-16T15:07:32,"I once drank a whole gallon of milk in a whole day and I could feel my bones expand. At first I thought I was just full from the milk, but my skin started to form stretch marks and I was visibly wider. I didn't know what was happening but I had an uncontrollable urge to drink more milk. I drove into the nearest gas station and literally ripped the door off the rifrigerated section containing the milk.  I started chugging gallon after gallon of milk standing right there in the store, my skin ripping at the seams. The cashier ran over to stop me but I swatted him aside and in one clean blow he landed across the room, shattering every bone in his pathetic meat suit. There was nothing left of him but a wet bloody puddle deprived of structure. I never thought I had it in me to kill but by now I had ascended beyond petty morality.  As I finished my eighth gallon it felt as though my stomach would rupture. My ribs broke out of my chest like a baby xxenomorph. My finger bones had grown through my hands a white nub could be seen protruding from my nose. My face was so stretched over my now massive skull I looked like Jenny McCarthy. My biceps and muscles were hard and calcified. My boner now had a bone.  I finished my twelfth gallon and began screaming and flexing, my skin tearing around my robust skeletal frame. With one final push I shed my meat chrysalis. I was free.  I didn't even use the door I simply walked out the wall of the gas station. Mortar and stone yielded to my mighty calcium. The cops were already there. In terror they began firing at me but even lead is no match for calcium. I walked straight toward one, reached down his throat and pulled his skeleton from his flesh sheath. With his bone I assembled a mighty claymore sword. With a single swing I cleaved the Earth in twain and descended into the inky black.

2018-11-16T15:24:32,"(Christ Witnesses to Nicodemus on being born again and what it means):  The same came to Jesus by night,  and said unto him,  Rabbi, we know that thou  art a teacher come from God:  for no man can do these miracles  that thou doest,  except God be with him.  Jesus answered  and said unto him,  Verily, verily,  I say unto thee, Except a man  be born again,  he cannot see  the kingdom of God.  (John 3:2-3).  ***The fact that Nicodemus came to Jesus by night may reveal the timidity of his faith. (12:42). However, his faith was developing. (John 7:50-51)<---Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?) (John 19:39)<---And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight).  ***(Born again): The Greek word translated again can mean either ""from above"" or ""anew."" The new birth, or regeneration, (Titus 3:5)<---Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the (Holy Ghost), is the act by which God imparts spiritual life to one who trusts Christ. Without this spiritual birth, a person cannot perceive spiritual things, (1 Corinthians 2:10)<---But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God). (1 Corinthians 2:13-16)<---Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ), nor can he or she enter the kingdom of God. (Verse 5).  (BORN AGAIN):  (Gk. gennao anothen) (3:3,7) Strong's #1080; 509: The Greek word anothen translated here as again could also be rendered ""from above."" The birth that Jesus spoke of was either a new birth or a heavenly birth---or both. It seems that Jesus was speaking of a heavenly birth because he later used the analogy of the wind, coming from some unknown, heavenly source, to depict the spiritual birth. But Nicodemus clearly understood Jesus to be speaking of a second birth--being born again. Jesus explains this new or heavenly birth in 3:6-8, contrasting being born of the flesh with being born of the spirit.",1,0,mlzanercik,7NiYVoqBt-8,0.004997086247086243,2018-11-16 15:24:32,True,True

I want to see a tale about an elephant, with abnormal ears, be made fun of and overcoming those bullies by being greater than they were and ever will be.

2018-11-16T20:18:19,"Well at least it looks like they're coming at it from a new angle (like the pretty good Jungle Book and unlike the soulless copycat Beauty and the Beast). Still, I'm just not interested in seeing Disney continue to effectively demote their classics with these live action remakes.   I know a lot of people (including myself) have nostalgia for the 60's Jungle Book, but the reason that remake worked was because the original movie was nothing too special from an objective perspective. The animation was just OK, and the story was little more than a series of barely connected vignettes. The remake had a lot of room to breathe, expand, and even improve upon what came before it. It was gripping, had strong themes, and had real character development (while the original had none of these things).  The trouble with adapting Beauty and the Beast and now Dumbo is that those were already top-tier Disney movies. You can go back and watch the original Dumbo tonight, and the mother-behind-bars scene will still bring tears to your eyes. It's like remaking Gone with the Wind or Lawrence of Arabia. What's the point? Oh yeah, a recognizable name that's guaranteed to rake in heaps of cash. *sigh*",21,1,T. Duffour,7NiYVoqBt-8,0.21850884622623754,2018-11-16 20:18:19,True,True

I couldn't hold it in anymore when the scene of Dumbo's mom locked in a trailer singing to her little baby and intertwining her trunk with his came on the screen.

Its hard to tell from the trailer, but if they paint circus acts in a positive light much like the original tended to do in some parts (all the excitement of seeing a flying elephant) then I'm dreading how much Circus tickets will sell during this movie's release because of hyped kids and stupid parents. Elephants are chained and abused in REAL circuses, along with other animals. They aren't magical flying creatures who speak to mice. Showing little kids this is just painting a false image and raising a generation of ignorance. Because let's face it, the only thing keeping circuses open these days are morons paying to watch. We're in a time where Circuses need to be shut down for the unbelievably cruelty to animals they bring. News of this abuse surfaces more than EVER these passed few years. There was just news about a tiger suffering a seizure right during an act and being whipped and beat to continue said act. In the 1997 anime film Jungle Emperor Leo, the story made it very clear how cruel circuses are to animals without trying to force a 'happy side' to it like Dumbo does with his flying ears. Unless this remake has a new twist at the end conveying a more clear message on the abuse of circuses (without GLORIFYING IT with Flying Dumbo, though this looks doubtful by the trailer) then I have no interest in supporting it.",0,0,EremikaHaven,7NiYVoqBt-8,-0.007334699031127607,2018-11-16 22:39:07,True,True

These movies cost 100s of millions to make. There is not, nor has there ever been a lack of new ideas. Its just unwillingness to invest in those new ideas. Remakes and Reboots make MONEY!!! New franchises are a crap shoot they are risky. In the early and late 2000s Disney released a ton of new orginal live action content and it almost all BOMBED!!! Proven franchises that guarantee a return are all the rage these days.

One day dumbo comes and with the kids encouragement flys for the crowd making him and the circus famous. This attracts the attention of a greedy businessman who convinces the owner dumbo is too attached to his mom and has her taken away.

They seem intent on butchering the original by introducing humans as the main characters just to say ""Dumbo needs us humans to save him and his mother and make it all right!"" In the original, it was his mouse friend Timothy and Dumbo himself who wandered around alone in the ugly circus world and eventually found his way. He did it the hard way, got drunk, had visions, went through terrible loneliness, then found his true power- the real shit! The spiritual path! Dumbo didn't even fucking TALK in the original unlike most Disney animals. He was innocent til the end. But live action needs to push dumb ditsy dialogues to make us all CRINGE. Dumbo didn't need humans to save him. But this live action Hollywood version needs to launch actors and have human faces for the masses to look up to and interview on late night talk shows. So they insert these unnecessary kids and Collin Ferrel to give it a little more ""star power."" Because Dumbo isn't the star in this film! And what's with the atrocious ditsy rendition of Baby Mine?

2018-11-19T15:26:45,"As much as it sounds exciting to have live action movies for all of the popular disney classics (Jungle Book, Beauty And The Beast, The Lion King, Aladin, Dumbo Etc...), I had a bad feeling the live action adaptions would not be as good or capture the magic of the originals.  I still want to see the live action movies because of curiosity, so i cannot wait for The Lion King in particular, as that movie along with Aladin IMO are one of the most popular and my favourite Disney cartoon movies. The Toy Story movies are up there but it isn't a cartoon, it's CGI with a more realistic 3D style.  They wont be as good as the originals though.  This trailor looks OK but i agree with the poeple who write about changing the story, bringing in the two children and not making it about animal cruetly and exploitation. What made Dumbo so special was that the film was all about Dumbo and focused on his perspective and the heart warming scene with it's mother was one of the best/most emotional scenes of the movie and in all Disney movies.  Also, the casting is a whole discussion on it's own. I kinda wanted the actors to look pschically like the original characters but they are either shorter, thinner or not right in one way or another. Perhaps they should have gone for unfamous actors who were more suitable for the part. Big names aren't always the right way to go IMO. Plus, famous actors distract you from the belivability of the characters since you know who they are and are very familiar with thier work...   I could literally write an essay on the new Dumbo film (even though i;ve only seen the trailor) but i will keep it short as this is this is a youtube comments section and so innapropriate.   On another note very quickly:   Casting Will Smith as the genie is wrong.

The family I feel steals the light away from Dumbo, and the story is more about them.

First off the fact that they got rid of an original Dumbo classic character known as 'Timothy Q. Mouse'  is just mind boggling. Instead they use two autistic children who suck ass at acting, I could have even played better as the little girl an I'm 5'11' and weigh 210. Something that also struck me as a Dumbo fan is the fact that they completely got rid of two famous iconic scenes from the original movie. One scene was the Song of the Roustabouts, and the second was they didn't have was Casey Jr.'s famous ""I think I can!"" scene. The only thing they got fucking right was the font they used on the word 'DUMBO'. In conclusion this movie was the worst fucking movie ever made in the history of mankind.

2019-05-21T19:42:27,"I have seen the movie today. Spoiler alert for those who haven't seen it yet. It was better than I expected! And after seeing so many good responses on the movie I already had high expectations. But Disney has outdone itself. Instead of just making a remake they reimagined the whole story leaving most elements although some were altered (although Timothy was shown as a white mouse in his suit in a cage his role was replaced by the kids, a lot of his lines were now done by the kids) and adding a whole extra storyline to it. That explains why it's twice as long as the original. I did find it funny that the ending was completely different. I wouldn't have minded if they would have left it intact. I mean, the original was made in the early 40s and the movie sets place around that time era and they weren't busy with integrating circus animals back to nature in that time, but then again I guess they have to choose political correctness for the crybabies who feel offended by the original movie. And yes I am very much for treating animals well and if possible getting circus animals back to nature or good sanctuaries. But I also understand that our knowledge about animals and animal cruelty has increased over the years and that what seems cruel to us (like a misunderstood mother and baby elephant now being the VIP's of the circus, yet still part of the circus, because of the baby's success during the show) wasn't perceived as cruel in the 40s. Thank God for the increase of our knowledge. But even if in this movie they hadn't send Dumbo and his mom back home into the wild I would have completely understood. It's something that would happen in 2019. Not in the 40s in which the movie takes place. Beautiful ending nonetheless, but I found it a little bit unnecessary to have a completely altered ending that doesn't fit in the image of the 40s. If they would have ended it with Dumbo and Jumbo now being counted as full family of the circus and treated well, it would have been okay with me. Not that this new ending isn't okay or beautiful, but unnecessary in my opinion.",0,0,Iv1309,7NiYVoqBt-8,0.1396828752642706,2019-05-21 19:42:27,False,True
