Now, as for the late lovely Paul, this would have been the chance for him to show case the talent he did posses. Unfortunately, to many years he spent making movies that where geared to more action genre that needed little acting ability to pull off. This movie will do fine, all of Sparks movies do well in the box office, it's cult following, like it or not. Too bad Paul wasn't able to do this movie, as cheesy as it may be, this was totally out of his element and it would have been awesome to see him transition into more dramatic roles.

It's already been said but I'm saying it again, all of Nicholas Sparks' books are different, yes they are all love stories but maybe if you guys actually read the original source rather than just saw the movies, you would realize that every love story has a different aspect to it. And I will say that most of the movies don't do the books half as much justice as they could have (Dear John, The Lucky One) but that's no reason to just immediately judge this movie as a generic romance. This one, if done correctly, is actually pretty heart breaking and has a lot of abuse in it. Family abuse, not the abuse like inside Safe Haven. So before you say, ""Oh another Notebook 2,"" maybe recognize that just because it's the same author, doesn't mean that this one will too involve Alzheimer's.

He buried a box and swore that he truly loved the girl and if God found someone who would love her more than it was okay. The boy and girl broke up. When the boy was in college he had a phone call from the girl's father. You see, the father always remembered that boy and called to tell him that his daughter was single and went to school in the same town. The boy met the girl again and they fell in love again. Two years after in christmas, the boy gave the girl a present. It was a shovel. The girl was shocked and grumpy but did as the boy said and dug. She found the box and opened it to see an engagement ring.

2016-12-10T17:08:28,"SPOILERS. This is one of the most cliche and forgettable movies I've seen. It's so predictable that I called 3 events miles before it happened. The first was how the girl deliberately unhooked the car battery. When the guy says the battery was unhooked, I freakin KNEW she did that on purpose so she could attract his attention. Turns out I was damn right when she confessed to him in one scene in their older self. Second was how I called that his high school best friend would die when it was prom day and how he brought the rifle to confront his father. The friend says like ""I'm coming with you"" bullshit and he just drives along not minding for him to tag along. That's when I KNEW he would die. A rifle and a friend tagging along which is such an unnecessary reason for the plot? Heck, he's definitely going to die. Then what happens? He gets shit with the rifle while the father son feud happens.  And lastly that moment where the son had a car accident (outta nowhere) and needs a heart transplant of all medical emergencies. Then it suddenly clicked. You're damn right that I freakin KNEW that the main guy is going to die somehow and that the heart would be transplanted to the son. Because the whole movie at this point is just so cliche, I KNEW it will happen that way because it was just so fitting. Then later on that same night, all of a sudden, the hospital managed to get a heart (in less than a day. How is that even possible? Most people had been waiting years for an organ donations.) That's when I knew my guess was 100% right. Then, lo an behold, the main guy dies and was later on revealed that the son found out the donor, then the girl was shocked for a moment when she was told by her son in the most un-poetic way for such a scenario, on the phone. This is such bullshit. And she just continues life, reminiscing her past with the guy. A scene where if she could meet her son and say ""I see him in you"" type of bull would've fit in better than this nonsense.  And also one more thing.  In the end, the dad of the dude gets away with it? Does this mean that bad people gets a way with everything? Like what hell this movie?? And also, what does the title have to do with anything in this movie??  Apart from that, the acting of both their younger and older selves were great. The other supporting roles were just okay too. The moments of friction between the dude and his dad were the most enjoyable part of this movie for me, at most.  I mean, come on... The writing and plot is just everywhere. It's like whatever is possible that could happen, no matter how ridiculous, it can happen in the movie. Please don't write anymore movies like this. It's just indirect comedy.﻿",0,3,Zeemas,mrEvBiqoeRc,0.10353479853479855,2016-12-10 17:08:28,False,False

It's clear that they were more focused on getting the acting on point rather than the appearances - because I've seen movies that get the casting done around purely the visual appearance even if the person can't act at all and is never in anything else ever again. Who knows, maybe people who haven't seen Teh Noatbuck will like this. I've never even heard of it. At least the actors got paid, but it has a 6.7 on IMDB (which is a C- or D+, haven't been to school in a while) and grossed the same as the budget - which surely doesn't include all the marketing that went into it.
