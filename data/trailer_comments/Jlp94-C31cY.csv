I would not be surprised if this whole divorce is just a massive prank on Jennifer Aniston as revenge for the 12 year long pity party she's been having in the media.  Scene: Brangelina's giant French castle. Jennifer Aniston comes running up to the gate.  JEN: Brad! Brad! It's me Jen! I broke up with Justin! I'm ready to come home now honey!  SUDDENLY THE BRANGELINA FAMILY APPEAR ON THE PARAPETS ABOVE HER.  ANGIE: HA HA HA!!!! I told you she'd show up Brad darling! I win the bet! You owe me two more genetically perfect children!  BRAD: Darn! I should have known! I mean, she was married to me, Brad Pitt, after all! God! I love saying my own name!  JEN: Brad! How could you do this to me! Damn you Angelina! How do you keep the world believing your some kind of saint?!  ANGIE: Its easy you silly little TV actress! I give away lots of money and have lots of adorable children! Speaking of which...children go ahead and start throwing! Wouldn't want the annoying delusional lady blocking the gate! Mummy and daddy have to go make your next brother or sister now! Maybe both!  THE BRANGELINA CHILDREN DRIVE JENNIFER AWAY WITH A HAIL OF PAINT BALLOONS!  JEN: Damn you Brangelina! I'll get you for this! Did you have to use white paint!
