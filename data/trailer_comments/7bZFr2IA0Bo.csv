2014-11-30T20:46:09,"NOTE: Hey, it's me in 2016! This is one of the oldest and worst mini-reviews I ever did in the days where I had no structure and little to no knowledge on films. I write much larger and more in-depth reviews that covers every aspect of the film from every angle, but I will nevertheless keep this up here to see how further I've developed over my time of watching movies and reviewing them.  I didn't have high hopes for a modern take on Paddington Bear, but I just decided one night to go and watch the film with some family reasons. The reason why I didn't have high hopes is because most modern day takes on nostalgic characters and ideas are usually atrocious, ( *COUGH* THE SMURFS *COUGH*) but ""Paddington"" genuinely impressed me.  The story is simple and easy to follow: a young bear from Peru with a passion for all things British travels to London in search of a home. Finding himself lost and alone at Paddington station, he begins to realise that city life is not all he had imagined until he meets the kindly Brown family, who read the label around his neck‚Äî""Please look after this bear""‚Äîand offer him a temporary haven. Not too confusing for younger viewers and it's very well played out.¬†  The characters are fine. There were 2 children in the Brown Family and I was surprised to find that only one was a stereotype for only a couple of minutes and then suddenly turns from an embarrassed hipster to a loving, caring person. I'm not gonna lie and say that the Brown Family, while being unique in their own way are standard, even if they are decently cast, well written and help to further the themes of acceptance and the like. Paddington is the typically lovable protagonist who plays the cuteness and the innocence thanks to a fair voicing by Ben Whishaw and you can't not root for him all the way through.  But onto one of my highlights of the film: the comedy. I wasn't expecting it, but the jokes, the slapstick and other multiple aspects of the comedy are brilliant. They're quick, funny, and worthy enough to guarantee adults to laugh alongside their children. It's probably one of the best aspects of the film altogether.  Paddington is a great family movie. Fun, witty, and full of charm, Paddington is one of the better family films this year.",15,1,ZeeCobra,7bZFr2IA0Bo,0.21207516339869287,2014-11-30 20:46:09,True,True

They got Paddington himself just right, which was of course the most important thing; he was lovely, charming, polite, curious and hilarious, everything Paddington should be. I laughed almost all the way through, although there were a couple of times when I cried -- there are more than a couple of very sad moments, and just seeing Paddington on screen was such a joy that I couldn't help but cry through happiness. The plot was excellent and the whole film was filled with a delightfully offbeat humour.
