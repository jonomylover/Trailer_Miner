2019-08-01T20:05:58,opposite the bank of england in this square is a memorial to those who died in the two world wars it's just going to  have a look at that what happens in terms of creating wars is a technique of  mind manipulation technique that I call in my books problem reaction solution  and it works like this if you want to introduce something say centralization  of power through the United Nations centralization of power militarily with  NATO the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the biggest military  organization in the world that's expanding all the time if you want to  centralize power into fewer and fewer hands if you did that openly and said  this is what we want to do there'd be a reaction against that people would say  hey this is a fascist state you you want to create we're not having this but  through this technique of problem reaction solution you can actually  manipulate people to demand you do what you want to do anyway so it works like  this first of all you create the problem but you get someone else to be blamed  for it you then report that problem through the media in the way you want it  reported because the media is owned by the same people that owned the banks and  the etc you get the public to react to yourproblem by saying something must be   done this can't go on what are they gonna do about it and at that point they who have  covertly created the problem and blamed someone else who gleaned that reaction  of do something then offer the solution to the problems they have created so if  you take the world wars after the first world war in which the financial centers  of London and Wall Street etc funded all sides power on this planet was in fewer  hands than ever before after the Second World War it was even fewer hands on the  wheels of power and as a result of the Second World War we had the creation of  the United Nations we have the creation of NATO and we had this great  centralization of global power problem reaction solution this is a wonderful  example here you've got this Memorial in the center of this edifice of global  power and it says to the immortal honor of the officers noncommissioned officers  and men of London who served their King and Empire in the great war 1914 to 1919  this memorial is dedicated in proud and grateful recognition by the City and  County of London I'm sure it is because as a result of the sacrifice they made  power in in the world came into fewer and fewer hands not least into this area  I'm talking in now and also made a fortune because not only does it create  problem reaction solution when you lend money to both sides they then have to  pay you back that money plus interest when both sides have devastated each  other's countries they borrow more money from you so that they can rebuild their  shattered countries therefore power equals control of money in the world as  it is today and the control of money comes through debt and wars create  massive amounts of debt therefore massive amounts of control  says here their name liveth forever more total people over  are manipulated to fight wars are merely pawns in a game they don't understand  the bottom here it talks about the  memory of those who died in the Second  World War 1939-1945 how ironic and how sick that that war was manipulated and funded to a  large extent from this building here the Bank of England the governor of the Bank  of England at that time was a guy called Montague Norman a very very close friend  of Hitler's banker and it was the Bank of England Wall Street and the  transnational corporations which had German subsidiaries not least the  Rockefeller Standard Oil in America Rockefellers another one of these  bloodline families along with the Rothschilds and others it was those  companies and banks that funded Hitler and allowed him to build a war machine  that cost literally millions of lives and before we move on and expand this  story on the other side of this square...,0,0,Ryan Potter,UcmZN0Mbl04,0.10525,2019-08-01 20:05:58,True,True

It was unique in the sense that it was so terrible and such a meat grinder of men that many of the tactics were not to be repeated. The stagnant lines, the gas attacks, heavy entrenchments, year long battles over miles of wasteland, and initial use of air and vehicle tactics. It all made for some of the heaviest and to be quite honest, unreasonable losses the world has ever seen. I have always wished they made more movies on WW1. Those who are interested I suggest you take a trip to visit the battlefield of Verdun which has much of the remnants of the battle intact. The ground is full of craters from the battle.

2019-08-03T13:04:51,"In 2 years, we have 2 excellent films based on WWI. Last year, the documentary They Shall Not Grow Old, and now the upcoming 1917, which looks amazing already. There's kind of a personal stake in this when I go see it.   My great-great grandpa actually fought in this conflict. Now, he did fight for the Germans but he was not down for the cause of the leaders. He simply fought for the country because he loved it. During this time, though, a major battle was raging. He, and I'm sure a few other men, had to pull back cannons from No Man's Land to behind their lines. Anyone that knows about WWI history, No Man's Land was basically a death trap. My great-great grandpa made it and was awarded the Iron Cross. That's quite the honor, I would say. He did immigrate over here to the states after the war and the first generation in the US, of my mom's side of the family, was born. One of grandpa's cousins today still has the Iron Cross that my great-great grandpa was awarded 100 years ago.   Seeing this and They Shall Not Grow Old, although they're both told from the British's perspective, is a reminder to me of what my ancestor had to go through. This was a war that could have been avoided and it very well could have prevented WWII, a much bloodier and larger conflict, from ever happening. However, that is debatable and Europe was going through massive economic changes. Either way, WWI history is just as fascinating as WWII's history. If anyone is wants to get a taste of it, I would encourage anyone here to watch They Shall Not Grow Old. If you haven't heard of it, the documentary uses actual footage of the events that occurred while all in color and adding voices and sound effects to the once silent films. It tells the story from the soldiers' point of view, everything that they had to endure. Then go see this when it hits. I know I will.",1,2,Herkamer63,UcmZN0Mbl04,0.1565235690235691,2019-08-03 13:04:51,True,True

The music is the most obvious giveaway with that ticking sound lol, the long takes and chase cams trying to make the action scenes more suspenseful but it feels and looks less quality. It just feels so flat or ‚Äústaged‚Äù where as Dunkirk felt real. The opening running scene for example just feels like a set in a field without any relevance or impact other than lets throw in some well placed explosions. And the camera quality makes the subject pop out way too much, it looks almost fakish. This era of directors really have lost their ability to make the visuals match the story. Everything is about shooting high res for no reason. It actually makes movies look bad, and staged. Super 65 is high res but its a format that has flexibility with its depth.

2019-08-18T23:24:45,"This is just another movie of the German wars about Judaism and they keep coming and I wonder for what. The holocaust was about Germans Vs Germans Religions. I understand people have a right to be of any religious organization that they want. Where are the movies about Catholics vs non-Catholics, because there were mass killings of people who were not Catholics. There are so many many many many movies based on this Hilter holocaust killings when in fact it was germans vs germans, but then I wonder about the dutch, polish, Danish, Russians Switzerland Judaism that Hitler did not get those countries.  I'm sure there were those who were living in Germany at the time. Now what is funny is the fact that blacks were drafted to help Judaism germans and yet was met with racism, which I do not understand at all.  Then there is the statement I was born Jewish, and I ask well what ethnicity are you, dutch, german, Russian, Polish, Irish, danish, Italians, Spanish, Portuguese, British and French, etc, they look at you as though you are crazy. I have a question mark expression on my face because begin born Jewish is not ethicity. Example, father catholic, born descendant from African slavery, given the brand as negro and I was raised in a methodist religion and give the distinguish as negro ethnicity Since the Africans were Yoruba, Igbo, Zulu, Sundanese, Lybia, Arabia, Ethiopians and etc as their ethnicity (nationality). Catholic, Methodist, Morom, Lutheran, Baptist, Jehovah witness, Buddha, Hindu, Islam, these are not ethnicities nothing more than religious organizations that people belong to.  So when people tell that they are Jewish I go to eastern European countries of people who automatically consider a member of that religion because their parents are already members. Yet their nationality is one of the eastern European countries which is their ethnicity. Their dialect is a given answer.   My father was considered a catholic because his parents were already in that organization and his statement to me was and I quote "" I was born a catholic and I will die a Catholic"". Yet he was a descendant from African slavery and given an English name as well as a branded a negro by the Europeans in the usa. So his ethnicity is African negro which is false because his real id was not known. Most African slaves brought over were given numbers in lots until they were sold to American people, who then, in turn, gave them English names. This is the history of Europeans upon Africans.

2019-09-11T10:31:12,"...another awful film pandering to someone's cinematic notion of what warfare is. This time it's set in the 1914-18 period,  for no other reason, than to place the plot cinematically, if not tragically. Charging over an open field, with not a spool of defensive barbed wire in sight, is some director's idea of capturing the futility of war. Peter Jackson's wonderful work of doctoring original first world war footage, has spoilt it for us. These are real participants in a tragic episode of world history, not male extras hired for the movie, who all look like models. Following in the footsteps of Dunkirk.

It is across this mostly abandoned and shattered landscape that our two men have to journey. The Germans had destroyed anything of value‚Äîburnt down the towns, taken most of the civilians, chopped down the trees, and they had left behind booby traps, snipers, and a few other unexpected surprises.‚Äù  So I'm guessing this takes place right before or during the Nivelle Offensive?
