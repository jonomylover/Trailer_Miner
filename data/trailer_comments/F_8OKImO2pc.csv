On the bright side, the camerawork and visual style looks great and the effects look solid. Maybe it will hold out, but I've said it before and I'll say it again. Horror is one of the hardest genre's to make a good movie in. I'm all for somebody making a good found footage movie because they way I see it the sub-genre has a lot of promise when done right, but since its super cheap to do and any idiot with a camera thinks they can do a good found footage horror movie it dilutes the quality of these types of films substantially. I really want a good horror movie, but every year, 99% of those horror movies are shit and you're lucky if you get one trailer that looks promising and then with the good trailers, you're lucky if the film ends up being good.   So far even with everybody complaining, this is still the most promising horror trailer released so far this year ( the first teaser is arguably better though) with Sinister 2 being number 2.

2015-07-19T19:13:56,"The song is by Think up Anger ft. Malia J but you can only hear it on YouTube. Just a side note for those complaining about being sick of the found footage movies; this movie was actually shot in 2011 on a very very low budget with a 7 person crew. They actually didn't even have a script, just an outline to follow and the actors basically improvd every scene. It's actually very interesting if you watch the interviews with the directors, they never expected anything to come of it but they cut a trailer and after a few very large production companies took interest they were given further funding to rework the movie and add to it and then it was screened and picked up by distributors for wide release. I would say with that in mind they did a way better job then a lot of big budget overdone ""found footage"" movies I've seen, and it has far more context to the story line then most where they just throw you into the action without any real backstory. It definitely starts out a little slow, but picks up speed as it goes and in my opinion kept you wanting more.

The ending was a jumpscare which could easily be put in another scene because the climax was awesome until BAM! It's over? I didn't even flinch. (I do love my horror though, so I wasn't surprised.) It could've been executed better by adding more intensity.
