I love how they said in this federal jurisdiction data on missing women does not exist!   the FBI agent was stationed in VEGAS or franks tune: LUCK BE A LADY TONIGHT?   while the predator hunter said there is no luck in the reservation.  The dead girl was sally Hansen, we know Hansen disease is LEPROSY or leopard tanks of axis sally etc?   at the same time they said a mommy cat that is teaching her cubs to HUNT and they killed a COW.  the DNR said she just killed  them and herself bye hunting domestic cattle.   just like jack reacher and the sniper who shot up a rape party.. this movie was about private contracted security that gang rape the native indian girl and killed her boy friend a  security agent at the oil rig.   Then they showed the perfect crime when you have them run with no shoes in the snow at extreme low temperatures and their  lung freezes.  hence, it is not MURDER, it is death bye WEATHER of Chicago bill ayers  although she had signs of rape etc.  that means the case stays with tribal police and not FBI that is  there for a murder.   I love how the rapist survived and had to be hunted.. the captured him and took him to the mountain top and released him to RUN with no shoes.  He ran until he collapsed and die and he showed us the Sistine chapel ceiling.. when the rapist was dying he turned and with a limp finger pointed to the sky just like in the Sistine chapel and died.. IF he made it across he would be a WARRIOR!!! like Jason bourne movie with renner.    the rapist death was just like armies crossing the alps into torino Italy.  if they make it, then show time... they showed the savages on the reservation in there warrior high.  then they fight and are shot while high bye the cops for no reason.  it is like the girls on indian reservations are used in a warrior feast and then the must hunt and chase the girl down like the MOUNTAIN LION with her two cubs... and the dead girl wanted to go to LA but the boyfriend was thinking Chicago (cubs).   since wind river KNOWS THE WINDY CITY!!!",0,0,Gold586,CZgN0dpFoaE,0.0654695767195767,2017-08-18 21:07:25,False,True
