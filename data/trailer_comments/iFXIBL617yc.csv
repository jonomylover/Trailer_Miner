2016-12-14T19:06:02,"They LITERALLY showed the entire movie. So, Dawson's character obviously gets with Heigl's ex-husband, Heigl goes bat-shit crazy. There's a few altercations that are kinda weird, they get increasingly weird, a few steamy sex scenes are also randomly thrown into the mix. Then Heigl contacts this man who really fucked up Dawson's past and makes the fake Facebook account to message him and make him think Dawson wants to reconnect. Then that man comes back, Dawson and him fight and she kills him. Then Dawson is investigated by police, but eventually let go. Then comes the final showdown when Dawson is released back home and Heigl is there all surprised she didn't go to jail and will probably say some line along the lines of ""I'll just have to take care of you myself"". Then the two are going to get in a stupid cat-fight and break a bunch of shit and they're going to keep making it look like Heigl might win, WAIT, no! Dawson might win! WAIT, no! Heigl! And back and forth and back and forth and I'm sure the husband will have been like tied up or possibly killed by Heigl before this fight started, either that or he'll come home randomly during the middle of the fight. Either way, Heigl will end up dead and it'll be a bullshit happy ending. They have made this movie SOOOOO many times.

Katherine Heigl made me laugh masturbating while she was talking to Rosario Dawson's crazy ex-boyfriend on a computer LOL. Katherine was very crazy LOL. Katherine's body is hot. She's cute. I don't know why Katherine was trying to force her daughter to ride a horse. No parent should force their young kids to ride a horse. Katherine should've waited until her daughter was a teenager to let her ride a horse. The ending made it look like there could be a sequel. Rosario was surprised to see Katherine's mom Cheryl Ladd show up at her house LOL. Cheryl had a look on her face like bitch I know you killed my daughter LOL.
