Recent crime films, such as God's Pocket and Drop Box (which seek to hark back to 1970s crime noir classics, such as Friends of Eddie Coyle, Killing of Chinese Bookie); do much to successfully highlight the meager existence of petty crime and underscore the movie with the aire of dark grit...  Neeson's recent film, Walk Among the Tombstones, was a decent film, both in character development and pace, and had a better premise and script than Run All Night, yet Tombstones did poorly in the theaters and I fear Run All Night will have little financial legs in the market.   Sadly, these failures do not need to occur; one simply needs more educated and film savvy screen writers and talented directors,,something I fear Hollywood is maintaining in ever decreasing numbers!",0,0,Kevin CALLINAN JR,7uDuFh-nC-c,0.010264227642276424,2015-01-11 12:40:33,True,True

2015-02-17T02:57:08,"Wait, so the mob boss wants revenge, because Neeson killed his son, but he had no choice because the boss' son, was going to kill his son? First off, the mob boss should be going after Neeson. But I understand why he isn't, those 2 used to be old friends, and if he los his son, its only fair for Neeson to lose his. Also, he pretty much said that after he kills Neeson' son, then he has his permission to die. The Danny Boy song, idk how, but it fits the trailer nicely. And it seems more people noticed, not just me, but the more action films Neeson has been in lately, they all seemed like Taken sequels or ways Taken could've went originally, but there was a change in the script, but instead of crapping the ideas, they saved them for later.  This film reminds me of 2 things. *Max Payne 3*, where Payne kills this mob boss' son, even though the son deserved it. But the boss actually went after Payne. This also reminds me of the movie *Death Sentence*, Kevin Bacon's oldest son in that movie, was killed by a gang during a robbery, the new member specifically, who was the son of the gang's boss, John Goodman in that movie. Kevin saw the killer's face, he got away and was hit by a car, so Kevin wanted revenge. The killer was identified in a line-up, but was going to get a short time in prison due to there only being one witness, and no surveillance. Kevin killed him when he found him alone. So Goodman wants revenge, so he goes after Kevin & his wife and youngest son. He killed Kevin's wife, but the son was in a coma. So Kevin then, wants revenge..... again, so he went after the rest of the gang members, and their boss. Btw, Kevin that film was some normal guy, not a former spy or marine, so that was a nice change a pace when it comes to action films about the main character wanting revenge after a mob or gang boss kills his(or her) family. Then again, Death Sentence wasn't even an action film, but it was still good.",0,0,TheGameKeeper94,7uDuFh-nC-c,0.14554637281910007,2015-02-17 02:57:08,True,True

2015-07-16T12:19:50,"After pirating it i gotta say it is a very run of the mill mediocre movie. There are things that worked and some that did not. First i have to say it is a well directed film. Very dark and gritty with cool transition effects showing you where the people are, action is done very well and smooth and you can tell what is going on. I also thought Liam Neeson did a great job here as emotionaly wrecked retired hitman, he embraced this character so well and i genuinely cared for him. Movie is well paced, it is interesting to watch and the writing is decent. But on the other hand it is a cliche movie, it reminded me of 16 blocks with Bruce Willis, there are huge plot holes, Liam didn't have great chemistry with his son, mostly because his son was bland and somehow dull, villains were generic, at one point they began to drag the movie too much, it becomes cartoonish at points, i did not care about his son and his family because in the end it is a very predictable movie which plays it safe. 2.5/5.",0,0,ogorjefan,7uDuFh-nC-c,0.15638888888888888,2015-07-16 12:19:50,False,False
