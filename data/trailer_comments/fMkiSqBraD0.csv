I'll write about that now, it's not that important so just be on your way. I just get defensive over someone.     Ok, so. At the very beginning, I absolutely hated Thomas. He just seemed like an arrogant guy who wanted everyone to feel miserable. But hear me out! Now that I've watched most of season 4 and all of seasons 5 and 6 I can easily tell you who my favorite is. I started liking him in season 4 because he just was so poor, he was tricked by O'Brian and he had such a giant crush on Jimmy. He never wanted to hurt anybody. And after that incident he tried so hard to make it up to him, we really got to see a new side to Thomas. If I had known that he could be so nice or that he is just so broken at the beginning I would've had my favorite sooner. He's gone through so much since season 4 and I just feel so bad for him so now, when I go to watch the movie with mum I want to see him happy.
