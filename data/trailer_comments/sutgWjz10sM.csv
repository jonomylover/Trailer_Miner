To everyone complaining about how Tris ends up dying, was it really a surprise? Tris has shown throughout the whole trilogy how she would be willing to give her life to save another's, did we really think that she would let her own brother die while she stood by? And she was right about being able to resist the death serum, she just wasn't expecting someone to be armed in the weapons lab. Don't get me wrong, I found it just as heartbreaking as everyone else. But I do think that is was an appropriate ending to a wonderful series.

2013-11-15T00:30:23,"the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the steep steps of the dock wall. Behind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in the mist. FOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray. CONVICT 2 I've done no wrong Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer! CONVICTS Look down, look down Sweet Jesus doesn't care. CONVICT 5 I know she'll wait I know that she'll be true - CONVICTS Look down, look down They've all forgotten you. CONVICT 1 When I get free You won't see me Here for dust! 3. CONVICTS Look down, look down Don't look'em in the eye. CONVICT 3 How long, O Lord Before you let me die? CONVICTS Look down, look down You'll always be a slave. Look down, look down You're standing in your grave. With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway. CRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean. Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength. Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind. Javert approaches Jean Valjean. JAVERT Now Prisoner 24601. Your time is up And your parole's begun. You know what that means? VALJEAN Yes. It means I'm free. JAVERT No! It means you get Your yellow ticket-of-leave. He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper. JAVERT This badge of shame You'll show it everywhere. It warns you're a dangerous man. VALJEAN I stole a loaf of bread My sister's child was close to death And we were starving. 4. JAVERT You will starve again Unless you learn the meaning of the law. VALJEAN I know the meaning of those nineteen years A slave of the law! JAVERT Five years for what you did, The rest because you tried to run. Yes, 24601! VALJEAN My name is Jean Valjean! JAVERT And I'm Javert! Do not forget my name. Do not forget me - 24601! He strides away to command the lines of convicts as they're marched away. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in that he is free at last. The convicts sing as he goes. CONVICTS Look down, look down You'll always be a slave. Look down, look down You're standing in your grave. 2 EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOULON - DAWN 2 Valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on his back. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. Behind and below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. As we hear the musical theme ('Freedom is Mine'), we see for the first time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope. VALJEAN Freedom at last - How strange the taste! Never forget the years - the waste, Nor forgive them for what they've done. They are the guilty - Everyone! The day begins (more) 5. VALJEAN (cont'd) And now lets see What this new world Will do for me! 3 SCENE OMITTED 3 4 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 4 Valjean strides down the long rising road, pulling his thin coat close round him against the cold winter wind. He passes a long line of labourers working. He approaches the OVERSEER. VALJEAN Monsieur can I help? A day's work? The overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap. OVERSEER Take your hat off. Valjean takes his hat off, revealing his shaved and scarred head. OVERSEER Passport. The overseer scans the yellow paper, and hands it back. OVERSEER No work here. 5 SCENE OMITTED 5 6 EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - END OF DAY 6 Valjean slogs on up the rising track into the mountains. Snow on the ground here, and darkness falling. He looks up and sees ahead a village built on a rock cliff, its lights twinkling, the snowy mountains rising behind. The tower of its handsome church rises up like a promise of refuge. This is Digne. 6A EXT. DIGNE - DUSK 6A Valjean enters Digne. As he drinks from the fountain, he sees a guard standing outside the Mairie. 6. 6B INT. MAIRIE, DIGNE - DUSK 6B Valjean stands waiting. The officer fastidiously writes down the name of Valjean in his huge ledger and the name of the town in his passport. The officer signs and stamps the passport. OFFICER Valjean. The officer hands back the passport. Valjean leaves. 6C EXT. DIGNE - DUSK 6C Valjean walks down the high street, spies the warm glow of an inn and enters. 7 INT. COUNTRY INN, DIGNE - DUSK 7 Valjean sits in the corner, his hat low over his head. He eyes hungrily a group of cart drivers tucking into a roast meal by a roaring fire place. The innkeeper serves him a beer. As he reaches for it his coat sleeve rides up to reveal his wrist, calloused and scarred by manacles. The innkeeper eyes him warily. He discusses Valjean with two other men, then asks for his paper. Sees the phrase ""Extremely Dangerous"". VALJEAN'S POV - From the yellow paper in the innkeeper's hands up to the innkeeper's face. A blank stare, a shrug of refusal. INNKEEPER My inn is full. 7A EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT 7A Valjean moves off wearily through the village. As he passes down the narrow street, faces peer at him from doorways, but the doors close when he goes by. A shadowy figure follows him. Word has spread that he's a `dangerous man'. Passing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a stop. Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife before him, his children on either side. Nothing special, and yet everything he's never had. 8 EXT. PRISON, DIGNE - NIGHT 8 He stops at the local jail. An iron chain attached to a bell hangs from the prison door. He rings. A grate slides open. 7. VALJEAN Jailer. Would you let me stay here for tonight? JAILER This is a prison, not an inn. Get yourself arrested. Then we will open up for you. The grate slides shut. As Jean Valjean walks away, some children who have been following begin throwing stones at him. He threatens them with his stick and they scatter. 8A EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT 8A He sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret. Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some straw. He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an enormous mastiff. It is a dog kennel. 8B EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT 8B Snow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road, hungry, weary, moving slowly, his trousers ripped and bloody from where the dog has bitten him. At the end of a road, the snow-covered church; beside it, a dark churchyard. 9 EXT. CHURCH YARD, DIGNE - NIGHT 9 Snow-covered gravestones in moonlight. Exhausted, Valjean collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the shelter of a doorway. A lantern glows in the dark. The lantern approaches, throwing shadows. Its little circle of light comes to rest on the crumpled figure of Valjean. He stirs and opens his eyes. VALJEAN'S POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness. Beyond it, the half-seen features of a kind old man. The BISHOP. BISHOP Come in, sir, for you are weary And the night is cold out here. Though our lives are very humble What we have we have to share. Bewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes with the Bishop into the house by the church. 8. 10 INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT 10 A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with silver cutlery. Two silver candlesticks light the room, illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. The Bishop ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room. The bishop's sister Madame Baptistine stands. Valjean hesitates. BISHOP There is wine here to revive you. There is bread to make you strong. There's a bed to rest till morning - Rest from pain, and rest from wrong. BISHOP Sit, my brother. The Bishop gestures to the housekeeper Madame Magloire. BISHOP Madame, set one more place. (to Valjean) Please sit. The Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair. Valjean sits, and the Housekeeper lays food before him. Famished, Valjean eats like an animal. The Bishop says a short grace. BISHOP May the Lord bless the food we eat today. Bless our dear sister and our honoured guest. (To Valjean) Please, eat. Where are you travelling to my brother? VALJEAN Pontarlier. BISHOP Is that where your family is? VALJEAN No. The destination is compulsory. That is where the Law sends me. I have no home. BISHOP Then let this be your home, for as long as you need it. 9. 11 INT. BEDROOM, BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT 11 The Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are also painted with religious imagery. Across the passage, Valjean sees the open door to the Bishop's own bedroom. There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a cupboard. He turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen waiting for him. He hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his life. But the Bishop is smiling, offering it to him. BISHOP Sleep well. Tomorrow morning before you leave you will have a cup of milk from our cows, nice and hot. The Bishop turns away to go to sleep. VALJEAN You let me sleep here next to you? How do you know I'm not a murderer? Valjean laughs a strange laugh. BISHOP God will take care of that. LATER THAT NIGHT - Valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep. Outside a dog barks. Valjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door. There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver is kept. Valjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep. He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop, disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown. He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is the silver. 10. Carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the door. 12 EXT. CHURCHYARD - NIGHT 12 Valjean rushes out of the back door of the house. He crosses the graveyard, scrambles over a back wall, and he's gone. 13 INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - DAY 13 The Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean before him. Valjean hangs his head, unable to meet the Bishop's eyes. CONSTABLE Monsignor, we caught the thief red-handed! He has the nerve to say you gave him all this! He upends Valjean's kitbag, and the silver tumbles out. The Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean. BISHOP That is right. Amazed, Valjean looks up. BISHOP But my friend, you left so early, You forgot I gave these also. Would you leave the best behind? The old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks. BISHOP (to policemen) Messieurs, release him. For this man has spoken true. I commend you for your duty Now God's blessing go with you. Silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn and leave. Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks. BISHOP But remember this, my brother - See in this some higher plan. You must use this precious silver To become an honest man. By the witness of the martyrs, (more) 11. BISHOP (cont'd) By the passion and the blood, God has raised you out of darkness - I have bought your soul for God. 14 INT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY 14 Valjean kneels in the church. He takes out his yellow passport and stares at it. He turns towards the altar, and the crucifix above it. VALJEAN What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run! And have I fallen so far And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years. If there's another way to go I missed it twenty long years ago. My life was a war that could never be won. They gave me a number and murdered Valjean When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of bread! Yet why did I allow this man To touch my soul and teach me love? He treated me like any other He gave me his trust He called me brother. My life he claims for God above... Can such things be? For I had come to hate the world - This world that always hated me! Take an eye for an eye! Turn your heart into stone! This is all I have lived for! This is all I have known! One word from him and I'd be back Beneath the lash, upon the rack. Instead he offers me my freedom! (more) 12. VALJEAN (cont'd) I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul... How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go? Slowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high, as if to the altar. VALJEAN I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in... As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin. Valjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the church. VALJEAN I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now! 15 EXT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY 15 Valjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory. Below lies the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley below. VALJEAN Another story must begin! He rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces out over the valley. The scraps flutter in the wind. FOLLOW the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind then fall away into the void below. One scrap of paper dances upwards in the sunlight. We follow this and accelerate upwards leaving Valjean and the town of Digne far below, towards the sun gloriously breaking through the heavens with the alps beyond. The camera then starts to tumble back down through mist and cloud below - through time and space - down to discover - 16 EXT. ROAD TO MONTREUIL - DAY 16 The camera hurtling towards three horses riding down a long muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out to the sea. We see ships sitting in low tide on the mud of the estuary along the dockside of the town, and red brick factory buildings. 13. SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: Eight years later Montreuil-sur-Mer, 1823. The camera closes in to ground level to reveal the horseriders: Javert, flanked by two policemen. 16A EXT. GATES TO MONTREUIL - DAY 16A As the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered around the gates - destitute and sick people clammering to get in. BEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day you're another day older And that's all you can say for the life of the poor. It's a struggle! It's a war! And there's nothing that anyone's giving. One more day standing about - What is it for? One day less to be living. Javert sees the destitution of the people. Expressionless as ever. BEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day you're another day colder And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill. And the righteous hurry past They don't hear the little ones crying And the plague is coming on fast Ready to kill - One day nearer to dying! TRACK PAST a plague victim, wrapped in a shroud, being thrown onto a cart. The police enter the harbour. 17 EXT. HARBOUR - MONTREUIL - DAY 17 The beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for the police. 14. BEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day there's another day dawning And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise Like the waves crash on the sand Like a storm that'll break any second There's a hunger in the land There's a reckoning still to be reckoned And there's gonna be hell to pay At the end of the day! Javert looks round at the factory buildings, the boats in the harbour, the poor clamouring behind him, and rides on. 18 SCENE OMITTED 18 19 EXT. FACTORY YARD, MONTREUIL - DAY 19 Heavy carts wait to be loaded with wooden crates of goods. Workmen carry the crates out of the factory as the FOREMAN strides in through the doors, gesturing to a cart driver, FAUCHELEVENT, who's taking a quick rest on a crate. 19A INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - MEN'S SECTION - DAY 19A The foreman passes men packing boxes on tables and loading boxes onto crates. He passes through a door under a first floor office. 20-22 INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - WOMEN'S SECTION - DAY 20-22 The long work space is full of tables at which conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet. An impressive sight: obviously a very successful business. A wooden staircase climbs one wall to a glass-windowed business office. The figure of a man within. FOREMAN (flirtatiously, to women) At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing! Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread! FACTORY WOMAN 4 There are children back at home - FACTORY WOMAN 2 And the children have got to be fed. 15. FACTORY WOMAN 7 And you're lucky to be in a job - The Foreman has stopped beside FANTINE, a pretty young woman. As he leans over to whisper in her ear Fantine, surprised, pricks her finger with her needle. FOREMAN (quietly, to Fantine) And in a bed! FACTORY WOMAN 8 (to Fantine, as a warning) And we're counting our blessings! The Foreman continues his rounds, encouraging the women to speed up their work. FOREMAN At the end of the day just be glad to be working For a master who cares for the lives of the poor. FACTORY WOMAN 7 He's a riddle.. FACTORY WOMAN 4 He's no fool.. FACTORY WOMAN 6 He's the answer to anyone's prayer FACTORY WOMAN 8 And he paid for the brand new school FACTORY WOMAN 4 It's no wonder they made him the mayor! FACTORY WOMEN Bless the man who leads the way! At the end of the day! They get on with their tasks, all glancing up at the boss in the office above. The Foreman returns to Fantine, trying to help her. MAIN FACTORY WOMAN Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today With his terrible breath and his wandering hands? 16. FACTORY WOMAN 3 It's because little Fantine won't give him his way. FACTORY WOMAN 5 Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands! FACTORY WOMAN 2 And the boss, he never knows That the foreman is always on heat. MAIN FACTORY WOMAN If Fantine doesn't look out, Watch how she goes, She'll be out on the street! The Foreman rings a bell, announcing the end of the work day. The women start to take off their overalls and pack up their tools for the day. FACTORY WOMEN/FOREMAN At the end of the day its another day over With enough in your pocket to last for a week Pay the landlord, pay the shop Keep on working as long as you're able Keep on working till you drop Or it's back to the crumbs off the table Well, you've got to pay your way At the end of the day! The women queue up to be paid by the Foreman at the door. Fantine has taken ou the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the steep steps of the dock wall. Behind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in the mist. FOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray. CONVICT 2 I've done no wrong Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer! CONVICTS Look down, look down Sweet Jesus doesn't care. CONVICT 5 I know she'll wait I know that she'll be true - CONVICTS Look down, look down They've all forgotten you. CONVICT 1 When I get free You won't see me Here for dust! 3. CONVICTS Look down, look down Don't look'em in the eye. CONVICT 3 How long, O Lord Before you let me die? CONVICTS Look down, look down You'll always be a slave. Look down, look down You're standing in your grave. With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway. CRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean. Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength. Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind. Javert approaches Jean Valjean. JAVERT Now Prisoner 24601. Your time is up And your parole's begun. You know what that means? VALJEAN Yes. It means I'm free. JAVERT No! It means you get Your yellow ticket-of-leave. He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper. JAVERT This badge of shame You'll show it everywhere. It warns you're a dangerous man. VALJEAN I stole a loaf of bread My sister's child was close to death And we were starving. 4. JAVERT You will starve again Unless you learn the meaning of the law. VALJEAN I know the meaning of those nineteen years A slave of the law! JAVERT Five years for what you did, The rest because you tried to run. Yes, 24601! VALJEAN My name is Jean Valjean! JAVERT And I'm Javert! Do not forget my name. Do not forget me - 24601! He strides away to command the lines of convicts as they're marched away. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in that he is free at last. The convicts sing as he goes. CONVICTS Look down, look down You'll always be a slave. Look down, look down You're standing in your grave. 2 EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOULON - DAWN 2 Valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on his back. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. Behind and below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. As we hear the musical theme ('Freedom is Mine'), we see for the first time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope. VALJEAN Freedom at last - How strange the taste! Never forget the years - the waste, Nor forgive them for what they've done. They are the guilty - Everyone! The day begins (more) 5. VALJEAN (cont'd) And now lets see What this new world Will do for me! 3 SCENE OMITTED 3 4 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 4 Valjean strides down the long rising road, pulling his thin coat close round him against the cold winter wind. He passes a long line of labourers working. He approaches the OVERSEER. VALJEAN Monsieur can I help? A day's work? The overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap. OVERSEER Take your hat off. Valjean takes his hat off, revealing his shaved and scarred head. OVERSEER Passport. The overseer scans the yellow paper, and hands it back. OVERSEER No work here. 5 SCENE OMITTED 5 6 EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - END OF DAY 6 Valjean slogs on up the rising track into the mountains. Snow on the ground here, and darkness falling. He looks up and sees ahead a village built on a rock cliff, its lights twinkling, the snowy mountains rising behind. The tower of its handsome church rises up like a promise of refuge. This is Digne. 6A EXT. DIGNE - DUSK 6A Valjean enters Digne. As he drinks from the fountain, he sees a guard standing outside the Mairie. 6. 6B INT. MAIRIE, DIGNE - DUSK 6B Valjean stands waiting. The officer fastidiously writes down the name of Valjean in his huge ledger and the name of the town in his passport. The officer signs and stamps the passport. OFFICER Valjean. The officer hands back the passport. Valjean leaves. 6C EXT. DIGNE - DUSK 6C Valjean walks down the high street, spies the warm glow of an inn and enters. 7 INT. COUNTRY INN, DIGNE - DUSK 7 Valjean sits in the corner, his hat low over his head. He eyes hungrily a group of cart drivers tucking into a roast meal by a roaring fire place. The innkeeper serves him a beer. As he reaches for it his coat sleeve rides up to reveal his wrist, calloused and scarred by manacles. The innkeeper eyes him warily. He discusses Valjean with two other men, then asks for his paper. Sees the phrase ""Extremely Dangerous"". VALJEAN'S POV - From the yellow paper in the innkeeper's hands up to the innkeeper's face. A blank stare, a shrug of refusal. INNKEEPER My inn is full. 7A EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT 7A Valjean moves off wearily through the village. As he passes down the narrow street, faces peer at him from doorways, but the doors close when he goes by. A shadowy figure follows him. Word has spread that he's a `dangerous man'. Passing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a stop. Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife before him, his children on either side. Nothing special, and yet everything he's never had. 8 EXT. PRISON, DIGNE - NIGHT 8 He stops at the local jail. An iron chain attached to a bell hangs from the prison door. He rings. A grate slides open. 7. VALJEAN Jailer. Would you let me stay here for tonight? JAILER This is a prison, not an inn. Get yourself arrested. Then we will open up for you. The grate slides shut. As Jean Valjean walks away, some children who have been following begin throwing stones at him. He threatens them with his stick and they scatter. 8A EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT 8A He sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret. Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some straw. He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an enormous mastiff. It is a dog kennel. 8B EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT 8B Snow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road, hungry, weary, moving slowly, his trousers ripped and bloody from where the dog has bitten him. At the end of a road, the snow-covered church; beside it, a dark churchyard. 9 EXT. CHURCH YARD, DIGNE - NIGHT 9 Snow-covered gravestones in moonlight. Exhausted, Valjean collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the shelter of a doorway. A lantern glows in the dark. The lantern approaches, throwing shadows. Its little circle of light comes to rest on the crumpled figure of Valjean. He stirs and opens his eyes. VALJEAN'S POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness. Beyond it, the half-seen features of a kind old man. The BISHOP. BISHOP Come in, sir, for you are weary And the night is cold out here. Though our lives are very humble What we have we have to share. Bewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes with the Bishop into the house by the church. 8. 10 INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT 10 A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with silver cutlery. Two silver candlesticks light the room, illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. The Bishop ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room. The bishop's sister Madame Baptistine stands. Valjean hesitates. BISHOP There is wine here to revive you. There is bread to make you strong. There's a bed to rest till morning - Rest from pain, and rest from wrong. BISHOP Sit, my brother. The Bishop gestures to the housekeeper Madame Magloire. BISHOP Madame, set one more place. (to Valjean) Please sit. The Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair. Valjean sits, and the Housekeeper lays food before him. Famished, Valjean eats like an animal. The Bishop says a short grace. BISHOP May the Lord bless the food we eat today. Bless our dear sister and our honoured guest. (To Valjean) Please, eat. Where are you travelling to my brother? VALJEAN Pontarlier. BISHOP Is that where your family is? VALJEAN No. The destination is compulsory. That is where the Law sends me. I have no home. BISHOP Then let this be your home, for as long as you need it. 9. 11 INT. BEDROOM, BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT 11 The Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are also painted with religious imagery. Across the passage, Valjean sees the open door to the Bishop's own bedroom. There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a cupboard. He turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen waiting for him. He hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his life. But the Bishop is smiling, offering it to him. BISHOP Sleep well. Tomorrow morning before you leave you will have a cup of milk from our cows, nice and hot. The Bishop turns away to go to sleep. VALJEAN You let me sleep here next to you? How do you know I'm not a murderer? Valjean laughs a strange laugh. BISHOP God will take care of that. LATER THAT NIGHT - Valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep. Outside a dog barks. Valjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door. There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver is kept. Valjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep. He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop, disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown. He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is the silver. 10. Carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the door. 12 EXT. CHURCHYARD - NIGHT 12 Valjean rushes out of the back door of the house. He crosses the graveyard, scrambles over a back wall, and he's gone. 13 INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - DAY 13 The Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean before him. Valjean hangs his head, unable to meet the Bishop's eyes. CONSTABLE Monsignor, we caught the thief red-handed! He has the nerve to say you gave him all this! He upends Valjean's kitbag, and the silver tumbles out. The Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean. BISHOP That is right. Amazed, Valjean looks up. BISHOP But my friend, you left so early, You forgot I gave these also. Would you leave the best behind? The old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks. BISHOP (to policemen) Messieurs, release him. For this man has spoken true. I commend you for your duty Now God's blessing go with you. Silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn and leave. Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks. BISHOP But remember this, my brother - See in this some higher plan. You must use this precious silver To become an honest man. By the witness of the martyrs, (more) 11. BISHOP (cont'd) By the passion and the blood, God has raised you out of darkness - I have bought your soul for God. 14 INT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY 14 Valjean kneels in the church. He takes out his yellow passport and stares at it. He turns towards the altar, and the crucifix above it. VALJEAN What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run! And have I fallen so far And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years. If there's another way to go I missed it twenty long years ago. My life was a war that could never be won. They gave me a number and murdered Valjean When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of bread! Yet why did I allow this man To touch my soul and teach me love? He treated me like any other He gave me his trust He called me brother. My life he claims for God above... Can such things be? For I had come to hate the world - This world that always hated me! Take an eye for an eye! Turn your heart into stone! This is all I have lived for! This is all I have known! One word from him and I'd be back Beneath the lash, upon the rack. Instead he offers me my freedom! (more) 12. VALJEAN (cont'd) I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul... How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go? Slowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high, as if to the altar. VALJEAN I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in... As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin. Valjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the church. VALJEAN I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now! 15 EXT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY 15 Valjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory. Below lies the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley below. VALJEAN Another story must begin! He rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces out over the valley. The scraps flutter in the wind. FOLLOW the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind then fall away into the void below. One scrap of paper dances upwards in the sunlight. We follow this and accelerate upwards leaving Valjean and the town of Digne far below, towards the sun gloriously breaking through the heavens with the alps beyond. The camera then starts to tumble back down through mist and cloud below - through time and space - down to discover - 16 EXT. ROAD TO MONTREUIL - DAY 16 The camera hurtling towards three horses riding down a long muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out to the sea. We see ships sitting in low tide on the mud of the estuary along the dockside of the town, and red brick factory buildings. 13. SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: Eight years later Montreuil-sur-Mer, 1823. The camera closes in to ground level to reveal the horseriders: Javert, flanked by two policemen. 16A EXT. GATES TO MONTREUIL - DAY 16A As the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered around the gates - destitute and sick people clammering to get in. BEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day you're another day older And that's all you can say for the life of the poor. It's a struggle! It's a war! And there's nothing that anyone's giving. One more day standing about - What is it for? One day less to be living. Javert sees the destitution of the people. Expressionless as ever. BEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day you're another day colder And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill. And the righteous hurry past They don't hear the little ones crying And the plague is coming on fast Ready to kill - One day nearer to dying! TRACK PAST a plague victim, wrapped in a shroud, being thrown onto a cart. The police enter the harbour. 17 EXT. HARBOUR - MONTREUIL - DAY 17 The beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for the police. 14. BEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day there's another day dawning And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise Like the waves crash on the sand Like a storm that'll break any second There's a hunger in the land There's a reckoning still to be reckoned And there's gonna be hell to pay At the end of the day! Javert looks round at the factory buildings, the boats in the harbour, the poor clamouring behind him, and rides on. 18 SCENE OMITTED 18 19 EXT. FACTORY YARD, MONTREUIL - DAY 19 Heavy carts wait to be loaded with wooden crates of goods. Workmen carry the crates out of the factory as the FOREMAN strides in through the doors, gesturing to a cart driver, FAUCHELEVENT, who's taking a quick rest on a crate. 19A INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - MEN'S SECTION - DAY 19A The foreman passes men packing boxes on tables and loading boxes onto crates. He passes through a door under a first floor office. 20-22 INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - WOMEN'S SECTION - DAY 20-22 The long work space is full of tables at which conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet. An impressive sight: obviously a very successful business. A wooden staircase climbs one wall to a glass-windowed business office. The figure of a man within. FOREMAN (flirtatiously, to women) At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing! Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread! FACTORY WOMAN 4 There are children back at home - FACTORY WOMAN 2 And the children have got to be fed. 15. FACTORY WOMAN 7 And you're lucky to be in a job - The Foreman has stopped beside FANTINE, a pretty young woman. As he leans over to whisper in her ear Fantine, surprised, pricks her finger with her needle. FOREMAN (quietly, to Fantine) And in a bed! FACTORY WOMAN 8 (to Fantine, as a warning) And we're counting our blessings! The Foreman continues his rounds, encouraging the women to speed up their work.

FACTORY WOMAN 6 He's the answer to anyone's prayer FACTORY WOMAN 8 And he paid for the brand new school FACTORY WOMAN 4 It's no wonder they made him the mayor! FACTORY WOMEN Bless the man who leads the way! At the end of the day! They get on with their tasks, all glancing up at the boss in the office above. The Foreman returns to Fantine, trying to help her. MAIN FACTORY WOMAN Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today With his terrible breath and his wandering hands? 16. FACTORY WOMAN 3 It's because little Fantine won't give him his way. FACTORY WOMAN 5 Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands! FACTORY WOMAN 2 And the boss, he never knows That the foreman is always on heat. MAIN FACTORY WOMAN If Fantine doesn't look out, Watch how she goes, She'll be out on the street! The Foreman rings a bell, announcing the end of the work day. The women start to take off their overalls and pack up their tools for the day. FACTORY WOMEN/FOREMAN At the end of the day its another day over With enough in your pocket to last for a week Pay the landlord, pay the shop Keep on working as long as you're able Keep on working till you drop Or it's back to the crumbs off the table Well, you've got to pay your way At the end of the day!

Christian Madsen is not Al, Al big broad features, Christian seems more like a Holister model. 8.) Tris just doesn't fit with the Shailene Woodley who i can only see as Amy from Secret Life of an american Teenager. 6.) They are 16 but most initiates look closer to 20. 7.) And i personally don't feel some of the cast fits their rolled characters. (mainly Al, and Tris) 8.) THEY better showcase my hometown Chicago because i feel that seeing the crumbling ruins of known places helped me envision their world.    From whative seen so far they will have to have to try really hard to find a way to win me over, and if they ruin it as a movie i will not be happy....",3,2,otircam01,sutgWjz10sM,0.1716304347826087,2013-11-15 01:11:35,True,True

Hunger Games was called a ripoff of Battle Royale.   IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY SAY, DON'T ARGUE WITH THEM, THEY'RE ALL MORONS. Read the books, see the movies, enjoy them and enjoy life and appreciate them along with your peers, and naysayers can suck it because no matter how much they complain, they'll never have the creativity to do more than that. ",3,1,Billie4Mozzarella,sutgWjz10sM,-0.0065972222222222265,2013-11-15 09:33:28,True,True

In the Hunger Games, children aged 12-18 years old are FORCED to fight in the games because of District 13's rebellion. In Divergent, sixteen year olds take an aptitude test to see what faction do they belong in and they can CHOOSE to stay in the faction they are in or leave to go in a different faction, but as a consequence, they must leave their old ways and follow that faction's rules. In the Hunger Games, Katniss's sister, twelve year old sister, Prim is reaped to fight, but Katniss volunteers in her place to protect her. In Divergent, Beatrice doesn't feel like she belongs in her selfless faction. When she takes the aptitude test, she's told that her results were inconclusion, which means she's divergent. I'm not going to say what makes her Divergent, but being Divergent isn't like the chosen one because other people are divergent as well. So, Beatrice chooses Dauntless, a bravery faction, but there are these things that are like exams to us. In order to be admitted to that faction, you need to take those exams which you must be ranked in the top ten or you'll be dismissed and become factionless. So, basically,  in Divergent, it's all about belonging somewhere and the protagonist finds out that her society isn't perfect and that the people are corrupt. In the Hunger games, the government is corrupt, a lot of survival and a rebellion is formed. I hope that clears things up. So, as a fan of both the books, please read both the books and watch both the movies before judging. ",5,1,Janet Oh,sutgWjz10sM,0.05166666666666666,2013-11-17 21:52:27,True,True

2013-11-18T02:28:08,"Dear all young adult readers or movie watchers complaining about how Divergent is copying The Hunger Games,  One, you probably never heard of Divergent until the trailer was released. Just like you never read The Hunger Games until the movie was released, either. Seeing as I'm someone who read both way, way before the movies were released, I think I qualify as someone who can tell you YOU ARE WRONG.  Two, Just because both novels are dystopians, which is a GENRE, a subcategory of Fiction->Fantasy, does not mean they are the same. They have two completely different plots, which, not meaning to spoil anything because everything I'm about to say is on the book jackets and in the trailers, makes the two SEPARATE books. The Hunger Games is about a group of 12-17 year olds competing for their lives in a sanctioned government tournament. Divergent allows a sixteen year old to pick what faction he or she wants to belong to, while only following the rules and guidelines of that faction. Do these plots sounds similar to you?  Last, if you want proof that Dystopian novels existed L-O-N-G before The Hunger Games, I can name a few books for you. 1984, Farenheit 451 (well, anything by Ray Bradbury honestly), Brave New World, I Am Legend, and even a more recent one (released in 2005, three years prior to THG), Uglies by Scott Westerfeld.  I think your argument is clearly invalid, and that if you claim to be such an avid fan of dystopians, you clearly need to branch out more when it comes to literary works.

Very interesting, although I hope they don't pull a Hunger Games and cut out all of the violence.  Not to spoil: The book is very calm and lays violence in very particular and ultra-focused turning point scenes, then goes fast paced forcing morally-ambiguous decisions in the climax. Without the threat of reality, it wouldn't be believable, and the message wouldn't come across.  With gruesome imagery, this movie could spark conversation and break though from novelty entertainment to mainstream consciousness, developing itself into a modern cornerstone of an inquisitive society.

2013-12-02T04:27:12,"I am very excited and interested to see Shailene Woodley portray as Tris Prior. I kind of watched The Secret Life of an American Teenager but  it wasn't something I wanted to watch, but I've seen both her movies: The Descendants and The Spectacular Now, which were fantastic. Before judging her, please at least watch both those movies; she's a great actor. I've seen the B-roll of the movie and the acting seemed real. When it comes to acting, I don't like it when the actors 'act', I like to see if they are able to be the character and make the character real. Shailene is definitely listening and reacting to what the other characters is saying to her while performing the scenes, particularly the ferris wheel scene. In my opinion, I don't think the Secret Life did any justice, probably because of the story and script or because her acting was still developing that time. In addition to her acting, I am excited to see her portray as Hazel Grace in one of my favorite books: The Fault in Our Stars. On the other hand, I am disappointed that in The Amazing Spiderman 2, they had to cut her scenes out because I really wanted to see how differently she could portray Mary Jane, but it's completely understandable.   Therefore, even though she doesn't physically look like Tris, Shailene, an Independent Spirit award winner for best supporting actress and a Golden Globe nominee for best supporting actress is definitely the right choice to be Tris. Based on the trailer, with the background music and the surroundings, she's got this. ",1,0,Janet Oh,sutgWjz10sM,0.18328634085213033,2013-12-02 04:27:12,True,True

I was beyond excited to see the movie and LOVED the series until the last 50 pages of Allegiant. I've never been more disappointed and angry with any author or any series as much as I am with this one. I admit that I do get entirely too attached to characters and have been that way since I can remember. I highly doubt I'll ever watch this movie or read another book by Veronica Roth.

The books were written beautifully with so much detail. I honestly see no reason to deviate.  Anyway, I am pleased that they cast Theo James as ""Four"". He is exactly what I envisioned he'd look like. As for Shaleene Woodley (I think that's her name), as Tris Prior, I was not sure about her until I read the 2nd and 3rd books of the series. I am now convinced they picked a great cast and I am glad we will see some relatively fresh faces on the screen come Spring. I do, however, wish casting directors would do a better job at choosing a diverse cast. I mean I get per the book it is fair to say the characters are possibly all white but it would have been nice to see them deviate from that aspect of the book and cast main not just supporting characters of all races, White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc. I guess even in a dystopian world not much has change in terms of hollywood.

2013-12-19T04:13:22,"I think the trailer is throwing everyone off. As we go further into new clips and exclusives, it's easier to tell that it should be a pretty well done book adaptation. The public mostly assumes it's a rip off of The Hunger Games Trilogy, but really it's because the early advertisements that were put out in public that would put Divergent under that name of being the ""New Hunger Games"", but they didn't mean that in a literal way, so to speak. So that is why the public is reacting in this way, and people like myself who have read and enjoyed the book series tell and tell again that it's not a rip off of it, but it is only the dystopian world in YA books that makes these series so similar. I think it's fascinating to see different interpretations of our society's future, and we shouldn't be criticizing absurd similarities that the ones who are not familiar with the series are assuming by this one, confusing trailer, which in my opinion is very good but tells the plot and the definition of the film in an awkward and unstructured way. The trailers of a movie don't really demonstrate the movie's quality too much (but it's only to explain the simple plot) which is why people should not be so dramatic about it. Overall, the trailer tells the plot fairly well, and because I love the books so much and the story really interests me, my ticket is already sold.

For those of you who have not read the book: This is a very original series based off of a clever idea, and shares very few similarities with the hunger games. It is very good though.

2013-12-22T23:24:44,"I like the concept but it _seems_ like another cliche chick flick. So this is what I got out of this trailer: So it's about a girl in a utopian society, she is different from everybody. She's like a secret; or they will kill her if she's exposed. The gov't or anybody cant find out so the lady/conselor/whatever sends her to a underground training facility with people like her. She doesn't want to be in there anymore because it's dangerous so she *tries* to run away with a dude that's just like her that she met while in the facility (maybe a training partner). _Not shockingly_, they fall in love while being together in the mist of everybody turning on her.  _Okay_, we'll put in into layman's terms, or a tl;dr friendly.  A girl at risk runs away with a boy she falls in love with. It achingly lasts for three books. Adding gore into a romance doesn't make it 'badass'. Hell, I can just read Romeo and Juliet!  It's like sprinkling sugar on a pile of shit. I think people who _read the book_ is naturally grown to love this indirect romance movie. Other than that, people who didn't read the book is going to ask 'what the actual fuck did I just watch' after the trailer and/or movie. She's like the modern Illuminati of Divergent.  _Now if you want a legit pile of shit (aka chick flicks/romance) that actually looks and tastes good with sugar_, I suggest you read Drink, Slay, Love by Sarah Beth Durst.

I have read all of the books in both series' (except for 'Allegiant', which I plan to begin reading soon) and I can confidently say that they have completely different plot lines. Yes, they are both set in the future, but this is pretty much the only similarity. 2) To those of you who are judging the entire series based off of a two minute trailer, please get your facts straight. Haven't you ever heard of the saying ""Never judge a book by its cover""? Divergent is most likely nothing you think it is. 3) Yes, there is romance in the story - but so what? Unlike most 'cliche' films/books, there is one love interest in the story, instead of a pathetically long drawn-out love triangle. Thank you for your time.

2013-12-27T17:04:23,"Can someone who's read the books help me please ..  Ok- I'm about halfway through the first book and the only thing that's confused me so far is this: OK so the test tells you where you belong.. But you're allowed to either pick where you grew up, or, if its different from where you grew up, you can pick whatever you're test told you. BUT you're not allowed to discuss your results, so doesn't that make the test pointless? Like couldn't you just pick any faction even if you didn't grow up there OR get it as a result? Since no one knows I mean... Granted, this would be pretty dumb BC if you didn't belong there , you probably wouldn't pass their tests and end up factionless... But still... They didn't really explain it much so I'm having trouble understanding the point of the test. And its obviously a HUGE plot point lol so i want to understand! Is it just to show you where you're most likely to have the most success? So you have less chance of ending up factionless? And then if youd prefer to stay home you can? But if that's the case, why is it such a disgrace to leave your faction? I get its bad to leave your family but isn't the whole point that factions area the entire point of life lol so why would your family want you to risk picking where you don't most belong (and possibly fail initiation) just BC you grew up there. Also, if you dont have to stick w ur result .. Doesnt that make anyone who doesnt go w their test slightly divergent too (since they have traits of two factions?) Or does the test mean that's really what you are SOLELY (but then how do they pass initiation of their home faction if they truly don't belong there)? Hope this makes sense and isn't too all over the place... I'd appreciate anyone's ideas! Thanks and happy new year to everyone!   Really just wanna see if I missed something or am not understanding.. It could just be a minor plot hole, and if so then whatever bc the book is still great!

In insurgent, tris starts to notice his dark hair is actually brown and that he has freckles. Tris doesn't notice these things until insurgent, which proves how well he blended into the dauntless, like he always had belonged there. Also, keep in mind, it's not about how the actor looks.

And, if you're put off by the trailer because its not the book, don't watch the film then, simple as. It's going to be a great film. Also, people saying the test isn't the same as in the book, look what Tris is wearing, black, not grey, which makes me think this is the simulation test and they haven't showed the aptitude test, so, it is only a trailer.

They build tris's confidence and showed how she went from being a self-less abnegation stiff to a 'cruel' dauntless.

The only movie and book that's even come close is The Boy In The Striped Pajamas, which is nothing like Twilight, Divergent, or Hunger Games (Its has to do with friendship between a German and Jewish boy during holocaust) But, yea Twilight, the movies and books are great it got me into romance novels and it will forever be my fav series. So, don't go hatin on Twilight and saying its horrible just because you don't like it  when its more than a million dollar franchise. I hate Harry Potter, but don't say its horrible because, its also more than a million dollar franchise, so next time think before you speak.

2014-03-21T01:59:19,"I'm honestly getting tired of Hollywood selling out and making these generic teenage novel based movies. I mean,  they're all the exact same thing consisting of the exact same structure as the last teenage novel movie.   Think about it. You have your generic ""most important"" female main character who is suddenly the ""chosen one"" who is the only relevant character in the entire movie. You have your generic strong male supporting character who eventually has a love interest in the main female character after acting tough and ""hard"" throughout the story, and eventually a love triangle will ensue after another strong male character is introduced.  Don't forget the ending. We all know that Hollywood (and since this was produced by Summit) will drag out the story into either a saga or a trilogy, and anyone with a brain will know the ending even if they didn't read the book. I honestly don't even have to say the ending, but for those who don't have any common sense: the girl falls in love with a dude, and saves the dystopian world through her special abilities acquired just by being a main character. The End.  Seriously. Why do people insist on supporting Hollywood and letting them make all of these book based movies? Why support them and let them think that unoriginality makes the best movies? There are some books that NEED a movie adaptation, but please let me emphasis SOME. Not every book published by a youthful author needs to be made into a movie. ",11,2,T.

No one got to see Al's vulnerable side so that people could actually UNDERSTAND him and get a bit attached. 2. also i dont know if Edwards eye being stabbed was supposed to be in this book/movie but maybe that will come up in the next movie. If not then thats stupid considering the fact that hes in the last book.  3. Peter made me like him, tf. NO. that was a huge no. Molly was also supposed to be douchey. 4. Four was rapey in the simulation instead of intimate. lol xD 5. Wills death was also not as significant as it was supposed to be, and it wasnt really too obvious that Christina and him had huge chemistry.  6. The WAY the mom and dad died. -.- 7. Tori seems tooo rough? idk. Tris doesnt get the other tats.

2014-03-26T12:54:10,"The movie was awesome but the biggest fault (in my opinion) was the severe lack of extras. There are almost 3 million people living in Chicago at the moment. In the future, that will be even more. And we're supposed to believe that there are only 40 sophomores/year 10 students in Dauntless, trying to qualify for 22 positions to make it in to that faction that year. So, if the other five factions took 40 initiates (of the same age) then that means there are only (roughly) 200 students in each grade (across all 5 factions). If that's the case, society would only be like 10,000 people, max. That doesn't seem like a very populous city. That seems like a really small town living in a massive city (Chicago) I come from a city of 5 million, and there were more than 200 people in my grade at school alone. The amount of people in my grade in the whole city would have been tens of thousands. There were only two scenes where it looked like there was a decent amount of extras and that was the choosing ceremony and when they did a bird's eye view of dauntless entering Abnegation. And even that was only a few hundred. You couldn't see their faces though, and most of the extras were CGI'd in more. I wish they had done this more, and made futuristic-Chicago looked like it has a more decent population. It really could have enhanced the world they were creating, and the future they were creating. Instead, it looked like the population of a high school, not an entire city like Chicago. This is something they took on board for Catching Fire though. The reaping ceremony looked really small and intimate. Then, in Catching Fire, all of a sudden Panem was ENORMOUS. You got to see the other districts and see thousands upon thousands of people in each district. I wish this were the case for Divergent, but hopefully they improve it in Insurgent and Allegiant. I doubt the extras would even need to be paid. So many people would do it for free, and then others would be pretty cheap, and you could CGI the same people into the background thousands of times. It just really took away from the ""world building"" because we're meant to believe this is an entire city, and all that we know that remains of the future, and it's just like 5 small grades in a small high school.",0,0,Josh Stevenson,sutgWjz10sM,0.15229629629629632,2014-03-26 12:54:10,False,True

BUT if you go to another faction, you can never return to yours. never live with your family etc and if you can't cope with the new society you chose, you become factionless aka homeless. i think the acting was great, i am glad they brought some new faces into the mix. the music was spot on and matched the scenes. the pacing was quick and they cut some of the emotional scenes from the book. so if you think this movie is going to be a hunger games rip off, or a slow, love story etc. you are wrong and i feel deeply sorry for you that you won't watch this greatness, due to the narrow minded people below.",39,6,bethany radke,sutgWjz10sM,0.1327324973876698,2014-04-18 09:12:59,False,True

Divergent is about five factions (that was created to keep peace) that all see equality (kind of at least) in eachother, but that there is people who have a mind that cannot be put in just one faction, and therefore is a ""threat"". The Hunger Games is about twelve districts being fully controlled and used by the capital for entertainment for example, but it's mostly focused on the ""hunger games"" where they force children to force eachother. I guess the biggest similarity is in Tris and Katniss. Two very brave and strong female caracthers who is not afraid to stand up for their self and others.

2014-05-02T19:10:20,"""With an adherence to YA formula that undercuts its individualistic message, Divergent opens its planned trilogy in disappointingly predictable fashion."" - Divergent currently has a 41% negative rating on Rotten Tomatoes (probably the most reliable critic's consensus site around) out of around 189 critic reviews. It is entertaining and at least is more sophisticated than Twilight, though it is more that than the far superior Hunger Games, but it is messily directed and lacklustre. I felt the usually brilliant Kate Winslet gave a disappointingly lazy performance as the villain, I didn't feel the icy menace or the darkness that, say, Donald Sunderland as President Snow (The Hunger Games franchise) or Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort/Tom Riddle (The Harry Potter franchise, needless to say) portrays. And as for the lead, Shailene Woodley is no Jennifer Lawrence (who is, quite obviously, the new Meryl Streep with her sheer, effortless talent and charisma), lacking the emotional depth and sexiness; she is pretty but has more in common with Kristen Stewart, however, I predict that this film franchise will continue and in terms of commercial success, become the new Twilight, but if it wants to be better than that, then Lionsgate or Summit Entertainment must start with getting a new director to direct Insurgent, the second instalment, which it already has in ""Red"" director Robert Schwintke. I'm neutral on this decision and I'm not sure what he'll bring to the Divergent franchise, but I hope it's better, I hope it's good and I hope Insurgent is realized perfectly in every way sense.",1,0,Mark McKenzie,sutgWjz10sM,0.17386363636363636,2014-05-02 19:10:20,False,True

This was hands down the worst book to screen adaptation ever made, they didn't even follow the right story line, more like used it as loose guidelines. They added parts that weren't even there and cut out important ones.

2014-05-05T13:08:20,Divergent >>> Hunger Games. Since we feel like comparing them. There we go :) Divergent just had a much more enjoyable atmosphere. There was not ONE scene in the books/movies that bored me. I couldn't but the books down or look away from the screen where as Hunger Games there were so many parts(mostly everything besides the arena) where I was bored out of my mind. That and Katniss was annoying as hell(except Jennifer Lawrence <3). I also feel like the Divergent books went more in-depth with the characters and the events in the book. In Hunger Games there were characters who appeared then disappeared and were never heard of again(like all the surviving characters after the war???) and the events just happened so fast it's as if Suzanne Collins was in a rush to get it published.

First i have to say Shailene Woodley is great young actress and her portrayal of Tris was very good if not great, plot of the film was interesting enough to keep me invested for the most part, supporting cast was also decent although i don't see people connecting to them like in the Hunger Games, movie looks fine and action is filmed well. But, there are way too many issues with it to say it's good.There is nothing at stake here, movie is way too long(they could cut about 20 - 30 minutes easily), it doesn't make sense, there is no character development so it is very hard to care about people here, some scenes go way too long, romanse is cliched, there is no strong villain and movie felt contrived and preposterous in the end. 2.5 / 5",0,0,ogorjefan,sutgWjz10sM,0.17793859649122812,2014-07-25 12:05:09,False,False

The film took a slow climb to its 'climax', and it was another one of those films that centered around a character that was unique and had a different character/mindset compared to all the others. It just makes us question, why him/her, or why just this one person, who thinks so differently and was able to make a difference, alter the course of events?  And yes like someone else mentioned, why is it always a couple, the love, the bond... Clearly, it was digging into teenagers' mindset.

I felt like I didn't care who survived or who died, mostly because everyone who died had almost no character development.

So PLEASE help us-the Vampire Academy fandom-get our dose of fangirling. The second book in the series(Frostbite) will be made if enough money is raised on IndieGoGo campaign. The first movie didn't do very well, but now we have another chance and we got different screenwriter and director. ANY amount of money would help(even $1). I'm sure $1 won't mean much to you, but if enough people would help, it sure would mean a lot to us.

Hunger Games is just a shit storm of stupidity compared to the idea behind this one. sure, Hunger Games is more popular... but that doesn't mean its better. it made more money... again, doesn't make it better. the Character of Triss, is also MUCH more believable than the character of Katniss... it actually shows Triss training, pushing herself to become better, yet she only get a little better... Katniss, your made to believe shes the best archer around... meanwhile, she's self taught? because she hunts animals? no. that's just foolish. when hunting animals, your are patient, and the animal is usually still, until it is disturbed, or moves on. i don't mind Hunger Games, i simply saw alot of similarities between the 2, didn't mean to actually bag on the movie, was simple comparisons.  Shailene Woodley is an extraordinary actress! believable character play, raw emotion, excellent emotional and physically control. Jennifer Lawrence is well known, and acting is mediocre at best, with some raw, yet seemingly forced emotions.  not a fan of Jen, as she is self admittedly very dumb. both movies are amusing, but 1 is more believable than the other.  this is my opinion, don't have to agree with me, and don't have to like it.",1,0,Ghostx339,sutgWjz10sM,0.1695294289044289,2014-08-25 18:26:13,False,False

A lot of people claimed that he is because it says so in the first book and in the additional SEPERATE series about Tobias BEFORE and a few parts of AFTER Tris transfers to Dauntless, called FOUR. The person that claimed he isn't is right, Tobias is NOT Divergent. In the first two books and in the Four series, everyone thinks he is Divergent because he is aware during simulations. In Allegiant- the last book in the Divergent series- you find out what Divergent is and that Tobias is NOT Divergent, it's just that his body has somehow activated the simulation awareness trait that all Divergents have. Read the series people, and stop acting like you know the series so well if you've only watched the movie and are only basing your knowledge of the Divergent series or just one of the books based on the movie.

Also even though the actor for four is really cute, i think the guy from the maze runner would have been a better cast for the fact that his nose is hooked and he wouldn't have looked that much older than the female lead....aside from the descriptions, I'm not sure if in the movie they change the order of the simulations, but thats mot cool-.-.....hmmm....i hope I'm not as disappointed with this movie as i was with The Host; assuming that i will watch this.",0,0,Woodleen ;p,sutgWjz10sM,0.07897869674185462,2014-12-26 10:24:42,False,False

It left out Edwards eye, when the initiates see their parents, no being executed in the water tank and then saved from her mum, the reason as to why she visited her brother was different, didn't build up the characters and give us as much insight to them, many many moments with Tobias (example his drunk rant, the moment she came back from visiting her brother, explaining that she should be more vulnerable so her friends stick with her... i can name plenty more) she was never 'out' of initiation in the book,their was no 'this is the divergent way of overcoming your fears', and then their was the ending with Jeanine, that didn't even happen in the book...

And the top opened, like kitchen door cabinets, and you could see the people, the passengers and employees. After a while, the captain was sitting in a seat while the stewardess was flying. That toy was very educational. It taught me that roles, are like boxes, and anybody can occupy a role. But the world is cruel - If you look like a stewardess, they will treat you like a stewardess. Well, how should a stewardess look? Why not this guy, or that other passenger, wearing a business suit? Could that not be a stewardess? Roles, occupations, are oft alike, and all involve carrying out instructions, and moving something from A to B. Cooking, chemistry, pulling levers, moving luggage, boxes really .. Force equals mass times acceleration .. See, gender neutral? Intelligence - this before that. I miss that toy, because it was food for thought. And so is that movie, A Little Chaos (Kate Winslet).

2015-02-08T04:22:29,"   Anyone who thinks that Divergent is like the Hunger Games is seriously an idiot. I mean first of all, sure both movies are dystopian movies but the themes are completely different. Divergent is based on a futuristic society where people are brought up in their factions which value one, distinct quality, and so they are brainwashed to only have that one,distinct quality. But there are certain people like us that are normal and have several different qualities and are thus called Divergents. There is no specific categorization in the Hunger Games. People are randomly put and brought into random districts. Also the Hunger Games is based on the games which people are forced to do that serve as a reminder from the Capitol that the people are under their control. In Divergent there is nothing like that except that Jeanine Mathews wants to eradicate the basic fundamental laws of human nature. She wants to make sure that people value faction before blood. Although in both movies, there is a rebellion, (in Mockingjay the people rebel to the Capitol, and in Divergent the people rebel indirectly to suppress killing Divergents), the reason for these rebellions is completely different because the problems in both the separate movies is different. You people who think that just because there is some government such as the Capitol and a rebellion in both the movies, you think that both movies are the same. That's not true because the message that each movie conveys is completely different. Divergent conveys a message about what could happen if our very own futuristic society were to turn into some scary utopia, and that if we had a certain categorization based entirely on people's personalities, the conclusion would be would this, disastrous and mind-blowing. The games in the Hunger Games are purely for entertainment and it is based on how Katniss sparks a rebellion in the people to change the way things are because it is wrong to watch people dying and enjoying it and calling it 'games'. Both movies reflect a certain problem in the society that has always been the perfect definition/example of a society at least in the perspective of  the leadership/Capitol, but the fault in the societies is completely different, and the truth is that neither society is perfect. And the way the two protagonists (Katniss and Tris) handle these problems is also different. Please do not say that these movies are the same or that Divergent is a ripoff of the Hunger Games because it is truly not. Sorry about that whole essay but I am sick of these hateful comments towards Divergent. Divergent has a completely different plot, story line, message, climax and ending to the Hunger Games. Each movie stands on its own and neither movie should be compared to each other because each of these movies has it's own identity.This is just to the people that are saying that these movies are alike, hopefully this will keep your mouths shut",6,0,Anand Sure,sutgWjz10sM,0.051257440476190484,2015-02-08 04:22:29,False,False

Even if you're a fan you leave these movies feeling less than. I hope the author of the book is raking it in because everyone who has seen these flicks is just wasting time. I mean, cloning is illegal or literarily should be. The only way movies like this succeed is when a powerful director takes the book in hand and raises it up. It doesn't have to be an exact translation and never is, but this director is just a bore and he's weak and we leave the theater wanting ALL the insipid characters, heroes and villains, to get smited until we realize that would be everyone and jeebus kreezwax I once again can't believe these cartoonish commercialized hollywood peeps get away with this roughtrade feminization of what could be called literature if you've been up all week and have taken many drugs.
