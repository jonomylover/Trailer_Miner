She didn't even seem grateful to accept the Emmy Award she won for the HBO movie.",0,1,greg herried,Jit3YhGx5pU,0.19114583333333332,2017-09-24 21:11:13,True,True

Even though the main plot point of the film ""wasn't"" resolved with a concrete conclusion, I will have to say that a majority of it was implied through the dialogue. Another situation that the film doesn't answer and   *spoilers*   I can see why it is irritating to end a film right before an important moment and would have provided a more satisfying conclusion if they showed an ending where the men in the bar that were probably responsible for the death of the main character's daughter were killed off by the two anti-heroes. But in defense of the ambiguous ending, I thought it was satisfying to end it that way.

I think some people are just excited that it's an original screenplay (although not much feels very original especially if you've seen In Bruges) and are praising it to the high heavens without real justification. Instead of keeping a serious tone the movie does what a lot of movies do and goes for cheap laughs right from the start - the problem is, it's not a comedy so you may well cringe instead of chuckle at some of the hammy acting and unrealistic dialogue. The ex husband's girlfriend - ""Oh! I kinda need to use the bathroom!? Oh is this inconvenient? I can see it's inconvenient"" Holy shit that's some bad moviemaking.  McDormand can't even order the damn billboard without the scene being hammed up right from the start. But at least she gets to say some swear words! Ho ho! Rockwell's character didn't work either, just comes off as an actor trying too hard. In fact, it's writer/director McDonagh who's trying too hard. And it shows. To anyone who gave up half way through, can't say I blame you. It does improve second half, but not by much. Anyone yet to see it expecting another In Bruges - you can forget about it.

If you see 1 movie this year, see “3 Billboards.” If you see 2 movies, see “3 Billboards” and “Get Out.” If you see 3 movies, skip the 3rd movie, get Hulu and see “The Handmaid’s Tale.”  After you watch “The Handmaid’s Tale,” you’ll never be able to listen to someone like Mike Pence or Ted Cruz or Tomi Lahren without memorizing the fastest possible route to Canada.",5,4,YesGregYes,Jit3YhGx5pU,0.23939393939393944,2018-01-26 12:31:47,False,True

What is she, a kid? 2) Woody Harrelson is dying from cancer yet looks completely healthy throughout. 3) Woody has a foreign and much younger wife; the background to which isn't explained at all. 4) Woody's Police interview technique. As with all movie cliches, there is no tape-recording of the interviewing or any video, there isn't another person present, and he's standing up leaning over her, menacingly, as he's speaking to her. In a modern country in 2017 like the US this would not be allowed to happen. 5) After Jason throws the guy from the window, causing him major injuries, it is witnessed by a Police chief and Jason isn't arrested, at any point!! He's just fired, like you would a Burger King employee who's late too many times. 6) The potential rapist who threatens Mildred in the shop- why?! There is no motive at all for him to come in and do that. 7) Mildred's amazing ability, despite her being a gift-shop worker, to fire-bomb a Police station with the skill, precision and expertise of an experienced Commando, like she's done it thousands of times. 8) Mildred gets away with attacking the dentist, despite him having an unusual injury that he would be very unlikely to sustain by himself. The interview is stopped because Woody is ill- so why wasn't it continued by another officer at the time? 9) Jason is allowed back into the Police station at night, by himself, after being fired. 'You've got your keys, just let yourself in,' he's told. Really?! After being fired? You'd surely go to his house and collect those keys, or at least change the locks. 10) Mildred experiences no consequences after attacking teenagers, with lots of witnesses around. 11) The billboards are on fire and Mildred, driving past, just happens to have with her a 50-liter fire extinguisher- very handy. And after the fire's put out, only the paper has been burnt, but the wooden structure is absolutely fine. Hmmm. 12) Why didn't the cops, who we're told have no problem with doing serious stuff like torturing people, simply rip down or deface the billboards in the beginning? They are far away from anywhere, with no residents, CCTV etc. 13) No proper investigation into the arson attack on the Cop Shop. 14) Jason turns from a psycho into a saint, despite undergoing significant trauma.",7,3,Yorkshire MGTOW,Jit3YhGx5pU,0.11001315235690237,2018-01-27 08:00:54,False,True

2018-01-30T02:35:02,"(SPOILERS) An old friend recommended this movie to me and my first comment to him was that the trailer made it look like a chick flick where the men are portrayed as either cucks, morons and villains, as it turns out my instincts were right on the money. This allegory is a testament to the dying patriarch in our country, highlighted by the dying sheriff coughing up blood on our female protagonist. One of the few nice guys that cowed to the alpha female lead is beaten and thrown through a second floor window. The racist evil male deputy is burnt alive by the female lead and only redeems himself when he gives himself over to her cause. The backdrop to this tale is the dead daughter sacrificed to the male evildoers, this alone allows the female lead to burn a police station, drill though her dentists thumb and cause mayhem through this tale unabated, her ex is portrayed as a typical asshole ex' in these chick flicks even though his daughter was killed under his ex wife's watch, half way through the film his ex wife seems to lose another daughter after making her walk miles into town, she is never seen or heard from again in the film.",0,0,Zodiak Paredes,Jit3YhGx5pU,-0.0698809523809524,2018-01-30 02:35:02,False,True

Once the London writer gets his predictable angry liberal rant out through his characters and actually attempts to depict rural America in an uncondescending manner (if that's possible for Hollywood). The second half starts to recover by softening Frances character and fleshing out Sam Rockwell's. Unfortunately, Frances' bitter, man hating character is way too one dimensional (the real woman Marianne Asher-Chapman, was much more nuanced, the Director should have depicted that) and frankly tiresome.   Rockwell, however, despite his hammy role written for him by an anti gun Londoner urbanite, puts in a sterling performance. I haven't watched the driberal self congratulatory bash at the Dolby theater but I'm assuming this movie did very well, the racket-machine had earmarked it for an ""Oscar nod"" months before and I think most, like myself, had decided they liked Frances character just going by the trailer cuts.

The story reveals how a series of omissions, neglections and prejudices contribute to the crime remains unsolved. To conclude, the misinformation, fueled by the local press, makes public opinion against the victim and favors the likely rapist. When he perceives the favorable scenario, the marginal one is freed by the streets and still is in the right to threaten the mother of the girl raped.

I felt McDormand's character was morally wrong and some of her actions unjustifiable. Normally this would be okay, but the movie seemed to not have addressed this at all. Her case had no leads, there was nothing anyone could do; why would she burn the police station? Stabbing the dentist? Wasting her money on those billboards? Like Woody's character said, the only way the case would be solved would be through ""sheer stupidity"", in other words; luck. And that's exactly what almost happened. The case was a dud. I felt the movie should have addressed McDormand's character's actions a little more.  In my mind she was in the wrong, and she was bringing everyone around her down along with her.

In the movie there is a scene where Mildred is chastising a priest for being compellable in the crimes associated with the priesthood because he had ""joined the gang"" I got really excited because I thought that the messaging was pointing to a really specific place. I thought that the movie was going to make a statement about the chief of police (Willoughby) and how he was beloved in the small town because overall he was a nice man and a good person but yet he was also compellable in the crimes associated with his gang (a.k.a. the police). At some point Willoughby said something to the effect of ""oh if I didn't hire racists I wouldn’t have any officers"" which reads as a lazy generalization on the part of his character to not do better due-diligence on the hiring in his force. So, sure he's a nice guy... but he's compellable so he's actually not the hero the town is making him out to be.    Furthermore I though the movie was going to demonstrate the social backlash of speaking up when you witness racism or calling the police out when they're not doing their jobs properly. Mildred's son demonstrated how he would prefer to remain socially compliant over outspoken because of the social pressure to conform around him whereas Mildred felt increasing pressure to fall into the social norms and behaviors of her small town.   I was really impressed with the movie up until none of this above ^^^ actually happened.

A year has passed and the police hasn’t still found the murder. Her mother felt remorseful, carelessness and deep sorrow all this time. And she is going to do everything to shed light on that horrified  event, because every murder must be found and punished. This film is about looking for justice by the law or not.
