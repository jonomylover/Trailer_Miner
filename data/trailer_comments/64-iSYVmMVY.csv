The only time something was collapsing was when they were near to getting out of the maze, and it was when the Gladers were all together. One more thing I don't seem to get, what's with the computer scanner thing on 1:06? Is that like the Griever Hole? Or is it this one at 1:20 where Thomas almost fell? I also don't get that bomb-looking thing on 1:02. (I'm pretty sure it's from a Griever, though). I know, it's just a trailer, I am really excited for this movie and it looks excellent at the moment.

2014-03-18T21:12:44,"Alright, time to pick this thing apart.  First of all, the video description says this: ""He has no memory of the outside world other than strange dreams about a mysterious organization known as W.C.K.D."" Okay, first of all, it's W.I.C.K.E.D., not W.C.K.D. And second, that's completely wrong. His only memory is his name (which, according to this trailer, he doesn't remember in the movie) and he knows nothing about W.I.C.K.E.D. until he goes through The Changing. He doesn't even know the name until he sees it on the back of a beetle blade.  Now for the trailer's inconsistencies with the book (not that all of these really matter a whole lot, but still): 1) The Box shouldn't have holes in the floor, walls, and ceiling. 2) As revealed in the prologue of The Kill Order, the Box shaft is actually only two or three stories high, and the shaking and movements of the Box are merely designed to manipulate the victim into thinking that the trip is a really long way up. The Box shaft is shown here as being really tall. 3) In the book, Gally isn't the first to greet Thomas, and regardless of who it is, no one jumps in the Box; they lower a rope and bring Thomas up on it. 4) ""Can you tell me a name?"" ""I can't remember anything."" Wrong! In the book, Thomas knows his name. 5) Why are all their names carved into the wall? 6) What's up with the Doors here? Where are the metal rods? 7) The miniature model of the Maze wasn't a thing in the book. And the Maze isn't circular; it's supposed to be a perfect square. 8) Lots of stuff in the Maze shown here that definitely wasn't in the book. Like the laser scanner. 9) What's that metal thing Minho is holding at 1:01? 10) Gally doesn't sound mean enough. 11) When Teresa shows up, she's supposed to be in a coma. 12) At 1:19, is he on top of the Maze? Nope. Not supposed to be a thing. 13) The walls change while the Doors close, not while Thomas and Minho are running through the Maze. And they're supposed to be super thick slabs of metal, not these slim turning panel things. 14) At 1:24, is Gally... drowning? I don't remember that happening in the book. 15) At the end. The Maze crumbling and falling apart and whatnot... not supposed to happen until book 3.  LOTS of inconsistency. But it looks well-made, and I'm still way-excited to see it. It's just that this is one of my favorite books ever and I want this movie to do it justice.",4,11,TheIcyPhantom,64-iSYVmMVY,0.07593434343434344,2014-03-18 21:12:44,True,True

Each month a new boy comes. The boy's memories have been erased. THey don't know how to talk, walk, crawl - ect. The only thing they know is their names. The main character's name? Thomas. Each person has a job. THe most dangerous job is the runner's job. You see, on each side of the maze there is two huge doors. At the first light of dawn in the morning, the doors open. If you go into the doors, you go to the maze. The maze is huge and dangerous. The runners have to run into the maze and calculate it for a way out. The maze is the only way out of the Glade. At night, the doors close. The runners must return to the Glade before the doors close. Why can't they just spend the night in the maze? YOU CAN'T. At nighttime, these horrible robotic THINGS come out, and they kill you. Nobody has ever survived a night in the maze. If you're by the doors when they shut, you get crushed. They're made of pure stone. When i said each month a boy comes, well, on day a girl comes. Her name is Teresa. She is the first girl ever to arrive in the Glade. Since that moment she came, everything changed. I know all of this because I read the first book, and i'm moving on to the second book. I don't want to spoil to much. Thanks for sticking around and reading this comment! ",1,1,Jek Fighter,64-iSYVmMVY,0.06055361305361305,2014-05-17 23:46:53,True,True

I understand that she put Thomas through a lot and stuff but it was all for the greater good. She also began to appear less and less in the third book. Instead, Brenda seemed to he taking her spot which made me kinda dissapointed becuase I still felt that Teresa had much to do with Thomas.

Dylan O'Brien did a very good job with this role and is turning out to be a pretty good actor as he continues to expand his range and reach in Teen Wolf and projects like this one. The story has its share of twists and turns and is in the same spirit of almost every other post apocalyptic/trial based story involving teens out now like Hunger Games, Enders Game and Divergent. Worth a watch and is left open for a sequel.﻿",2,0,AnointedFlow,64-iSYVmMVY,0.2756666666666667,2014-09-19 07:44:29,False,True

If it were never a book and someone came up with this exact screenplay then it would have been one of the best movies released in 2014 yet. But because so many of you have read the book, you're comparing the film to the books, therefor making a judgement on the creativity of production. Everyone knows they can't add or put the exact scenes of every book into a movie. Even with the authors permission, it would still be copyright and they obviously don't want to take away the credibility of the book.

And people telling they are copies, no, they're not. I mean, yes, they are things that look alike, like kids being in tests and the ""maze"" and the ""arena"", but other than that, we have, NO ROMANCE whatosever. No love triangle (and that totally wins me, i'm sick and tired of those!), the ""badass girl"" people said in the comments below shows up like 40 minutes after the movie started AND she's also get like 20 minutes screen time and a few scenes with Thomas (Dylan).

Let me tell you why; without spoiling much, it had a pretty good plot, not the best, but pretty good, and THERE IS NO ROMANCE in the entire movie, which I love. I'm not a big fan of romance, and the hunger games, divergent and stuff like that I haven't watched for that  reason and others, so I was very pleased when I watched this, though that may me just me. Certain parts which were, or I think were, suppose to tug my ""heart strings"" didn't really do it that much, while others got me pretty hard. The costumes were nice, and I think the CGI was great. Also it's a pretty good stand-alone movie if you life cliff-hanger endings.

I would definitely rank it high among the other top box office hits, but it still fell short in my expectations. I'm really hoping for a great delivery on the second film, because the second book was definitely better than the first. The acting and visual effects are very top notch, but the film needs to be slowed down to add character development. The book actually made the reader become attached to the characters so that if/when one died, it was big. The movie was so rushed that I had a hard time figuring out who I liked and who I didn't like.
