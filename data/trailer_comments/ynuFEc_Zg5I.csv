2018-10-05T23:27:52,"It occurs to me that a lot to you guys only watched the anime and don't know anything about the actual story of dragon ball so allow me to educate you.   1. Goku was NEVER shown as a toddler or infant, so this isn't changing anything. You not realizing that filler was never canon doesn't make Akira wrong. We get an explanation from master Roshi, but we don't see goku as an infant at all.   2. Akira wrote a manga explaining the actual story of Bardock, Gine, and the saiyans and how goku was sent off, called dragon ball minus. In minus, we see everything thay we saw in the trailer, besides vegeta being in a pod. The only thing ‚Äúretcon‚Äù the movies and Bardock special, both of which aren't even canon to begin with so it doesn't even matter. Since the movies and oneshots weren't even canonical to begin with, this doesn't actually contradict anything, since the things you're claiming this contradicts weren't even his work and were never part of the canon from the start. And yes, you could argue that goku was a baby when he was that age.   3. If you read the minus, Bardock and Gine decide to tell raditz the real reason for sending off Goku but as we know, freeza destroyed planet Vegeta soon after while raditz was away. So raditz didn't know and believed what freeza and his henchmen told him, which was that planet vegeta was destroyed by a meteor. That's why he comes to earth not knowing the real reason in the first place. That's why in the start of dbz he asks Goku why he didn't complete the mission simply because he was still loyal to the freeza force and believed their version of the story. They show him with vegeta while off planet when the attack begins.

Did Goku use the Kaioken as SSB or did he use mastered SSB?  Is there a SSJ4 yes or no?  How did Goku learn Ultra Instict by watching Master Roshi or getting detonated by the Genki-dama and ‚Äúbreaking through his shell?‚Äù  Is Future Trunks SSJ2 more powerful than Goku‚Äôs SSJ3 or did Goku one shot him in that form?  My point is right now Dragon Ball doesn‚Äôt exactly have canon. Its a multiverse with a myriad of timelines with slight and not so slight variations.

The only exception to that is Bardock's last stand against Frieza which is only two-three panels in the manga. I did remember reading somewhere that he read the manga all over again before writing Battle of Gods, hopefully he did the same for Broly.  The problem Dragonball has always been that Toriyama was more into writing jokes than writing an action manga with a long continuity. That's why he doesn't plan anything in advance. From an interview, where he explains why he forgets:  ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt forget those ideas, then I won‚Äôt need to come up with new ideas. Do you remember Super Saiyan 3? I forgot about it and I thought that was Super Saiyan 2, even though I created those characters.‚Äù""   https://comicbook.com/2017/03/21/dragon-ball-akira-toriyama-super-saiyan-forms-anime/",1,0,robotroadrage,ynuFEc_Zg5I,0.16858379715522576,2018-10-11 10:13:43,True,True

He was just another ordinary Saiyan, the only difference between him and the others being his drive to seek freedom from Freeza, so much so that he himself launched an attack on Freeza. In Minus, Bardock is boring and not very compelling. His character is different from a normal Saiyan but there's no reason for it to be different. Why is he more compassionate? Why does he actually care about his wife and son when all other Saiyans shrug off those attachments? No reason is given, and, as a result, it's not at all convincing. Minus failed to make me care about Bardock or Gine. The only thing slightly interesting about Gine is just the fact that we don't really know much about her past, it's all a mystery and it has potential.

2019-01-16T14:36:55,Interesting frieza isnt wearing his armour. Is the creater ingoring the events from his orginal timeline. Cuz bardock confronts frieza and king vegetta attacks frieza ship. But if these events are changed does this make dbz timeline useless. If the creater was going to scrap or change stories around then he might of well started a fresh. He could make movies out of the old episodes. And then continue making new movies instead of shows. Honestly theres not enough story or events to make a the dbz or dbs interesting. Its just one big hardcore wrestling match after another. With the winner beining the most popular character.,0,2,Aaron Heininger,ynuFEc_Zg5I,0.2487603305785124,2019-01-16 14:36:55,False,True
