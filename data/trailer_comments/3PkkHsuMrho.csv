2014-09-17T17:15:23,"SPOILER! (for those who haven't read the books, obviously) I'm so glad they put Effie back instead of completely forgetting about her like Collins did. I mean, she had such potential as a character and it bothers me when I remember that even Annie Cresta got more attention than her which is really unfair(not to mention the stylists who got a huge chunk of pages while Effie just lay in the backdrop of the entire Mockingjay book, like an afterthought). And though Annie is important, she is merely a tool for developing Finnick from a ''hunk'' to a deeper someone we could relate to. Effie could have had such grand character development as a written character, but alas it was not meant to be. So I'm super excited to see her have her screen time :) Now if only I could turn back time and rescue Cinna, that would be awesome... :'(",0,0,Ms14787,3PkkHsuMrho,0.11799242424242423,2014-09-17 17:15:23,True,True

It felt forced and dragged out, I read it because I wanted a closing to this series but majoritly of the time felt bored or upset with it. Yes there were some good parts, but they were few and far. The first movie was alright (I poked and prodded at the differences), but I didn't like Catching Fire (it moved too slow then too fast, she figured things out too quick, not so painful). Based from this trailer I will not be watching this movie due to the disappointment in CF, as far as I can see stiff acting (not believing they are the characters), and the general upset I may find. This is my opinion and I'm sorry if I may have offended anyone. Everyones opinion is different.

I really hope that they change the age rating of the movie to something for older people otherwise they're going to water-down the deaths throughout the war and that'll really suck. one reason why the deaths are so horrific is that they're supposed to mentally scar Katniss very deeply (if she were to survive the traps etc which she does). I mean she sees injured people in a ""hospital"" blown to bits, guys legs get blown off in traps and they get speared and¬†melted, heck even Finnick gets his head ripped off by mutant lizards and Katniss watches her little sister burn to death. (that'll be in film part 2). The psychological damage¬†done to¬†Katniss is very deep in mockingjay and I think that if they sweep that aside then it'll never be as good as the book. that's one thing that's very hard to¬†portray in a film compared to a book is psychology and the thoughts that go on in peoples heads.",1,0,lee wood,3PkkHsuMrho,-0.05937499999999999,2014-11-01 01:55:12,True,True

After that she kinda liked Gale, because he gave her energy and ""fire"". ¬†  But then, when they go for their second round and Peeta's heart stops, she truly begins to realise that she has feelings for him. You also see it from Finnicks face expression, because he made it quite clear at the start that he didn't believe their love story. But in that moment, he sees it. Then, at the beach, the big long kiss that she gives Peeta - she didn't do that for the show. She wanted to kiss him and Peeta realises that aswell.  Then in the third part, she has to make a decision. In the end, she chooses Peeta because he is warm, kind and loving. Gale on the other hand, has the fire, the urge to fight (a bit like her, which isn't exactly the best thing after all that she's been through. Also, in the third book Katniss states that she could never be with Gale, because he had something to do with the death of her sister, Prim.¬† I also think that Katniss and Peeta have been through the same stuff and no one, not even Gale, will ever understand what it felt like. Katniss and Peeta have a lot in common due to the Games. I just believe that after everything, the 74. & 75. Hunger games and the rebellion, they need each other. Because no matter what, they kinda always were there for each other.¬† It is unclear in the books if they get married or not, but they probably did. After about 15 years of convincing Katniss, she and Peeta have 2 children.¬† And I know that she said that she didn't want any, but you have to imagine, by the time, they are roughly 35 and things have changed.¬† I like that she chose Peeta in the end, because it didn't work with Katniss's mom and Peetas dad and now it's kinda like they did it - they were meant for each other.

I reckoned). Before Katniss' mother banned it, Katniss and Prim made rope necklaces like in the song. ""It meant that a life of torture must have not been worth living"". But to the point one in revelation, Katniss really understood what this means, because she knows that being tortured by the damned Capitol is a much worse fate than death.  ‚ô´ The Hanging Tree by Mockingjay: Katniss Everdeen ‚ô´ Are you, Are you Coming to the tree Where they strung up a man they say murdered three Strange things did happen here No stranger would it be If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree  Are you, Are you Coming to the tree Where the dead man called out for his love to flee Strange things did happen here No stranger would it be If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree  Are you, Are you Coming to the tree Where I told you to run, so we'd both be free Strange things did happen here No stranger would it be If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.

Goes hysterical because she can't find her sister. 3. Love triangle monotony 4. Why include Effy? She's not in the 3rd book.

Movies based on novels are not created for lazy geese like you who can't read a page, they're for those who can read a book and enter a whole different universe, to bring to the screen what we imagine while reading the books. And in no way can the movies achieve what the books do, because in those pages you find everything from sorrow and happiness to internal confliction, written so perfectly that it tears you apart. Movies do not have such monologues so it's impossible to get the same feel from them. And you people saying you ""don't get the movie"", that's because you're too stupid to ignore the books. They leave out some bits while making the movies because they're understood by those who've read the books. So go pick up those books and do yourselves a favour.
