Glasses are very harmful for your eyesight they actually make your vision even more damaged than they were to begin with. There is a shortcut you can utilize to get excellent 20/20 vision naturally without the use of glasses or contacts. When someones arm is broken do they put on a cast forever and never take it off? Course not, the arm heals itself over time and returns to normal. The visual cortex (aka the eyes) arethe strongest muscle in the body so why is it when it is harmed and cannot function properly (Imperfect or blurry vision,) do we wrap them up in a permanent cast? The eye CAN and will heal itself if given the proper treatment. Guys, This is so important so please do the best thing you can do for yourself and go and take some time to look into this because The fact is you can get visually perfect eyesight back and get rid of those annoying hard to keep up glasses and annoying contacts for the rest of your life and see perfectly no matter how old you are",1,1,Get Perfect 20/20 Vision Naturally,gOW_azQbOjw,0.13549382716049385,2015-03-24 01:04:31,True,True

Glasses are very harmful for your eyes they actually make your visual cortex even more damaged than they were when you first started wearing them. There is a program you can implement to get excellent 20/20 vision naturally without the use of glasses or contacts. ¬†If you broke your arm would you wear a cast forever? Of course not! Your arm would heal and go back to normal given time. ¬†The visual cortex (aka the eyes) arethe strongest muscle in the body so why is it when it is harmed and cannot function properly (Imperfect or blurry vision,) do we wrap them up in a permanent cast? The eye CAN and will heal itself if given the proper measures of care. ¬†Listen everybody, This is ¬†of the utmost of importance so please do yourself a favor and go and check this out because ¬†The fact is you can get ¬†visually perfect eyesight back and toss your expensive contacts and hard to keep up glasses out the window for the rest of your life",1,2,Get 20/20 Vision Naturally,gOW_azQbOjw,0.15873015873015875,2015-03-25 00:14:42,True,True

Here's my call;  The M:I series is insanely schizophrenic. First movie was a very 60's-style suspense spy thriller with few explosions and more intense direction and ambitious cinematography. Second movie was your typical John Woo flick - violent, flashy, highly exciting but also DARK and EMOTIONAL, two other common John Woo traits that noone seems to talk about. Third movie mixed things up, it was more of a realistic, gritty and highly emotional action film with a bigger sense of desperation, and also a healthy dose of inspiration from the TV show 24 with Kiefer Sutherland. Great film. Fourth film? It seemed to be a throwback to the first one with it's retro kitsch and 60's-style spy shenanigans, but it was ultimately an action adventure a la Tintin, Indiana Jones or Modesty Blaise. I had a hard time taking it seriously.  What can we expect from the fifth one? I'm hoping it WON'T be like Ghost Protocol. I just watched M:I 4, 2 & 3 in that order, and it struck me how much more moving the 2nd and 3rd films are than Ghost Protocol. They're so very different from each other, but the films completely swallowed me whole, and I was in for the whole ride.",0,0,HarpoTheVillain,gOW_azQbOjw,0.028048780487804882,2015-04-04 15:50:41,True,True
