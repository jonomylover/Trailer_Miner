It's sort of an arbitrary way of putting yourself above people if you ask me. It's like saying my favorite flavor of ice cream is x, therefore I'm better. I guess it's tempting for people to do this because then all they have to do is eat some food and they're automatically cool or something :) Anyway I don't think we should be bound to doing things that people consider ""cool,"" but be confident in our own judgment. If I feel like having soda, I'll still have soda, even if people will find an arbitrary problem with me not drinking, say, wine instead. But from my perspective, I would just be drinking what I felt like drinking, and wouldn't feel a need to change just because someone would claim, with unjustified certainty, that there's something wrong with that.
