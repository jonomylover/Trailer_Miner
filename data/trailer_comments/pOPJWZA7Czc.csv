This is movie is for people looking for creativity mixed in with life, you make the most of life by making it your own, even in the toughest obstacles, you keep going because you never want to think ""what if"" this never happened. You want to explore until the end, yes its portrayed as a comedy, but it has a beautiful story of fighting for what's right even if the odds are against you. I hope people give this movie a chance.

The ones you would here about Monday morning at lunch like “omg did you know that she sucked him off at the back of the bus on the way home from six flags?”   3. The smart kids. Ones who always made highest of honor roll with a 4.0. Already thinking about college and shit.  4. The Likeable kids. Pretty mediocre in academics. Sometimes known as the ‘class clown’, always making the whole class laugh, sometimes good friends with the teacher, and had cool friend groups.  5. Athletic kids. The ones who would play all the sports not just for the school but for the city too. They had their own hangout spot at lunch.   6. The shy and quiet kids who also sometimes fell in within the smart kids group too . They were kids who had very little friends. Terrified of asking for anything.
