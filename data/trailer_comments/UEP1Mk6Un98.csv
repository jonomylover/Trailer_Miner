2016-12-09T21:05:09,"SPOILER ALERT:    YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!       The virus that killed most of the human race is still having an effect on the world.  The virus is making apes all over the world smarter and giving them the ability to speak like Caesar.  On the other hand, the virus is having the opposite effect on the children born from the human ""survivors"" of the virus.  It is making them less intelligent and taking away their ability to speak.  Until a cure can be found, the humans have decided to kill all their children affected by the virus in order to preserve the species' good genetics.  Unfortunately, no human child has been able to avoid the effects of the virus. The Colonel's son was killed for this reason.  During Caesar's journey to find the colonel, Caesar encounters a human army deserter and kills him in self defense.  Apparently, this man deserted in order to keep his daughter, who was affected by the virus and cannot speak, alive.  A reluctant Caesar and his group take the girl with them in order to save her, but Caesar also thinks he can use her as a possible bargaining chip.  At this point, Caesar has no idea about the virus and what effects it is currently having on the humans.  Because, the human race is essentially becoming extinct due to the virus, and apes are evolving and becoming smarter, the humans have decided that the only way they can survive is by wiping out all apes so they can buy more time to come up with a cure for their current condition.  The humans fear that even if they do find a cure, it will be too late because the apes will have taken over if left unchecked.  Some of the humans do not believe in the war and do not agree with the order to kill the children.  Therefore, they eventually become allies with Caesar, who after finding empathy for humans again, decides to help them.  A conflict ensues between the human army and the human/ape army.  In the end, the human armies destroy themselves, and the apes take over.  In the next movie, with the human species on the ropes, Koba's followers begin a genocidal campaign to wipe out the remaining humans.  Caesar allies with the remaining humans in order to fight an Ape super army.  Caesar and the humans also discover that Caesar is the key to a cure for the virus, as he was the original host of the disease.    After the Koba apes discover that Caesar holds the cure for the virus, they plot to assassinate him.  Of course, Caesar is eventually murdered by those he trusts (""et tu, Luca?""), and with no hope of manufacturing a cure because of Caesar's demise, the humans decide to nuke the planet.  In the end, almost all of the human race, which still resided in human cities throughout the word, was wiped out, and the Apes, who mostly lived in rural areas, were able to avoid the nuclear destruction and take over the world and enslave/kill what little remains of the human race.

2016-12-10T01:47:00,As a member of the Greek community and a part of one of these organizations this is highly offensive. Sororities at UC Berkeley make it their goal to give women a place to feel comfortable as well as better the community. Comparing specific houses to characters from a movie about bullying is absurd and beyond inaccurate. Making the claim that sororities are cliques is demeaning the sisterhood and values they are founded on. This clearly is a stab at a community on campus that does nothing but support the rest of the student body.  Welcome joseph,0,0,abhiofficial,UEP1Mk6Un98,0.1825,2016-12-10 01:47:00,True,True

Animals in zoos get put down all the time all over the world when some dumb parent fails to keep an eye on their kid. So why does this random ape take the cake? I have seen a rooster get blown away with a shotgun and have yet to see it become a sensational meme with psychos in PETA up in arms.   An animal getting shot...Hmmmm somehow that's newsworthy? Sounds like a desperate story¬†to distract everyone's attention. ""Hunter shoots deer on trip!"" Does that sound like a sensational story or meme? No it doesn't, but why?¬†   Answer: Because the media loves to distract the weak minded unwashed masses away from real news with sensationalism and deception.
