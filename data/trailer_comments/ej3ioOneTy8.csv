All in all the trailer doesn't have so many spoilers. there are so many twists and turns that they don't reveal. Honestly this trailer makes the movie look like it jumped from the pages which I am super excited about. There are so many direct quotes word for word from the book. ""In your face Neil Armstrong."" That's a direct quote from Watney in the book. there are so many others that are difficult to point out. Long story short, if you're interested in this movie, READ THE BOOK.

Anyone who knows that an MIT aerospace spacesuit engineer is working on a thinsuit can let the thickness of the suit pass--even though it does not look like a thinsuit, but what is completely and unequivocally unforgivable to people with a brain--especially space enthusiasts--is asking us to suspend disbelief over that confounded joke of a helmet-collar assemblage; the helmet does not link up with the collar, and it is completely obvious. It looks exactly like the stupid collar-helmet assembly from the Imperial Stormtroopers in Star Wars. But that is a fantasy of legendary proportions that our consciousness is set up to accept in such a way as it automatically sits right in our minds. If nothing else, Star Wars is for children, largely, but The Martian was written by a scholar of astronautics and aerospace and oribital mechanics.

There are a few areas that are sharply unrealistic, like the plastic holding in livable air pressure in the habitat, after the explosion. With 1% average density compared to Earth's, there would be a tremendous pressure difference between inside and outside. Example: it's impossible to open an airline hatch when the plane cabin is pressurized for cruising altitude, around 11 PSI (compared to 14.7 PSI for standard 1 atmosphere of pressure), putting a great outward force on the cabin main hatch, compressing the hatch sealing rim. Mars would be a much greater difference. Another would be the accoustic reflection of the engines back onto the main hatch of the rockets they use.

They have the best chance of doing something like this. The Russians (Soviets) had all of the firsts in space apart from the lunar landing in 1969. Yuri Gagarin, Sputnik, etc. Read about them on Wikipedia.

In my opinion, I prefer 1.2001:ASO 2.interstellar 3.martian                   *Cause whenever we watch a film, we always wishes to think about a convincing ending. In the case of Martian, after the first 30 mins we can clarify that whatever it takes, they definitely gonna to rescue the protagonist from that stranded planet; i.e the climax is predictable. It's about how they gonna to save him and What are the struggles they are going to face in their path.                     *But in the case of interstellar, the matter is completely different, each and every frame of the film is intense and deals with new concepts. And the major highlight of interstellar is we can't even think about it's climax. And even though it is a convincing ending, we can't control our tears, due to it's plot twist. In addition to this, the RR of interstellar is completely different from other films made before it.                 So, in means of concept,story,screenplay and story telling, interstellar is incomparable with any other films other than 2001:ASO.                 The only similarity between interstellar and Martian is their plot (space).  Note: sorry for my English😊",9,2,know the unknown,ej3ioOneTy8,0.04993315508021389,2019-05-25 15:48:42,False,False

The celebrity/Hollywood/liberal crowd live in a totally delusional world that will never be no matter how many movies they produce. The producers pushed every PC button on this one. A corn rolled jive turkey hood looking black kid was the brains that saved the day, The Hard nosed Commander not just a woman but a babe who of course has the faithful dweeb husband at home, Making sure they have a complete mix of the ethnic and racial groups and finally of course the mix crew who only saw each other as crewman on a almost 2 year isolation mission? Total BS. If this type of isolated flight was possible the men who were getting laid and those who were not would be at each others throats and one or all the women would have been pregnant. I know this because that is what is happening in our military since they allowed woman in all areas of the military. Especially in the Navy.  I am sorry ladies. you folks as a whole will never be the equal of men in these types of area's and if it was not artificially manipulated you would see very little of woman in these fields.",0,3,John Cameron,ej3ioOneTy8,0.09770454545454546,2019-06-15 12:52:38,False,False
