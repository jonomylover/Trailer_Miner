We had 3-4 Great Whites at our location. 1 young one with not more than 2 meters, 2 were females, about 3-4 meters long, and one bigger male, 5-6 meters long. They were not aggressive at all, instead they were curious about what strange beings like us are doing in THEIR environment. The only thing that interested them was the chunk of rotten fish on a rope, that was used by the very professional crew of that cage diving ship to guide the sharks closer to the cage.  Now, I recommend everyone to do at least one cage dive in his/her life. You will see, that sharks are beautiful animals. You have to look at them as the lions or leopards of the sea. Yes, they are predators and yes they CAN be dangerous. But only under very specific circumstances (i.e. if they mistake a swimmer or surfer with diving suite as one of their prey: seals and sea lions). Honestly, you also wouldn't just walk at a group of lions and try to touch them, wouldn't you? Same with sharks: respectfull distance yes, fear no.  Still the most dangerous ""animal"" on this planet is the human. Compared to only a few dozend shark attacks with deadly ending WORLDWIDE every year, sharks are killed in MILLIONS by humans every year. Mostly just because some dumb pieces of sh** in south-asian countries believe, that dried shark fins work like Viagra. So the fishers catch the shark, cut off his fins without killing the shark and throw back the living shark in the ocean. The shark then suffocates, because he needs to swim to be able to breath.  Same bullsh*t like shark fins counts for rhino horn, tiger bones and what ever else those dumb motherf***ers in southern asian countries, mostly Vietnam, eat or sniff to get an errection!",0,0,MichaelK79,LBmBcASLdK8,0.04884615384615384,2017-05-01 13:54:00,True,True
