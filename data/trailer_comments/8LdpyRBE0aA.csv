2017-11-23T14:16:53,"Saw this last october and I gotta say, it's okay. This movie is so typical while the humor is okay as well, at least better than the emoji movie. Some things I guessed right, before watching: 1. Gargamel would again use Smurfette, only to Smurfette fool him back. 2. Like the previous two abominations, It would start with either Papa or Narrator smurf introducing Smurf Village and how Smurfette was created by Gargamel 4. Movie ends with a Dance Party 5. The lost village is full of female smurf and somehow one male (although the latter is false, ALL FEMALE smurf village is shown instead)  THE NEXT GUESS IS A SPOILER. STOP HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SPOILED  6. SPOILER: Smurfette dies but revives a few minutes later in the movie  But as for Sony's part, animation was so flowing, character designs are beautiful, especially the female smurfs. I like how they went into small details, from little green fireflies flowing around, to that tiny sprinkle when the firewood gets heated. For a small budget, they made the movie without making it too lazy (*ahem ILLUMINATION STUDIOS *ahem). Smurfs: The Lost Village is not bad per se, it's just okay. A good movie for you and your kids to enjoy. I even think this is an improvement over the last two in fact, after seeing this, you'll realize how awful the smurfs look in the previous two. Go see this one but I'm telling you, this isn't the perfect movie but it is timeless and overall enjoyable.",0,0,Sargent Gaming,8LdpyRBE0aA,0.0762687969924812,2017-11-23 14:16:53,False,False
