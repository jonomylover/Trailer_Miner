That night, the furious woman grabbed a knife and in the midst of her rampage, took her children to a nearby river. She then stabbed them both to death and as soon as she woke up from her frenzy and realized what she had just done, started to run up and down the river, desperately screaming for her kids ""Ay, mis hijos"".

2018-10-19T16:11:31,"The Actual Legend  The Mexican legend goes that in a rural village there lived a young woman named Maria. Maria came from a poor family but was known around her village for her beauty. One day, an extremely wealthy nobleman traveled through her village. He stopped in his tracks when he saw Maria. Maria was charmed by him and he was charmed by her beauty, so when he proposed to her, she immediately accepted. Maria's family was thrilled that she was marrying into a wealthy family, but the nobleman's father was extremely disappointed that his son was marrying into poverty. Maria and her new husband built a house in the village to be away from his disapproving father. Eventually Maria gave birth to twins: a boy and a girl. Her husband was always traveling, and stopped spending time with his family. When he came home, he only paid attention to the children and Maria knew her husband was falling out of love with her. One day, he left and never returned. Years later, as Maria and her twins were walking by a river, she saw a familiar carriage with a younger, beautiful woman next to her husband. Maria was so angry and confused that, without thinking, she picked up her two children and threw them into the river, drowning them. Only after she saw their bodies floating in the river did she realize what she had done and she then jumped into the river, hoping to die with her children. Now she spends eternity looking for her children around that river. It is said that if you hear her crying, you are to run the opposite way. If you hear her cries, they could bring misfortune or even death. Also, if you are a child, be extra careful, because La Llorona is attracted to children, thinking they are hers. Since she thinks children are hers, she tries to drown them. Children should not walk alone around this river, just in case. Many parents in Mexico use this story to scare their children from staying out too late.  At the gates of heaven, she was challenged over the whereabouts of her children, and not permitted to enter the afterlife until she found them. Llorona is forced to wander the Earth for all eternity, searching in vain for her drowned offspring. She constantly weeps, hence her name ""La Llorona.""[2] She is caught between the living world and the spirit world.[3]  In some versions of the tale, La Llorona kidnaps wandering children who resemble her missing children, asks them for forgiveness, then kills them to take the place of her own.[4] People who claim to have seen her say she appears at night or in the late evening by rivers or lakes.[5] Some believe those who hear the wails of La Llorona are marked for death but those who escape in time are not, as in the Gaelic banshee legend.[3] She is said to cry, ¬°Ay, mis hijos!

2018-10-20T21:42:14,"village there lived a young woman named Maria. Maria came from a poor family but was known around her village for her beauty. One day, an extremely wealthy nobleman traveled through her village. He stopped in his tracks when he saw Maria. Maria was charmed by him and he was charmed by her beauty, so when he proposed to her, she immediately accepted. Maria's family was thrilled that she was marrying into a wealthy family, but the nobleman's father was extremely disappointed that his son was marrying into poverty. Maria and her new husband built a house in the village to be away from his disapproving father. Eventually Maria gave birth to twins: a boy and a girl. Her husband was always traveling, and stopped spending time with his family. When he came home, he only paid attention to the children and Maria knew her husband was falling out of love with her. One day, he left and never returned. Years later, as Maria and her twins were walking by a river, she saw a familiar carriage with a younger, beautiful woman next to her husband. Maria was so angry and confused that, without thinking, she picked up her two children and threw them into the river, drowning them. Only after she saw their bodies floating in the river did she realize what she had done and she then jumped into the river, hoping to die with her children. Now she spends eternity looking for her children around that river. It is said that if you hear her crying, you are to run the opposite way. If you hear her cries, they could bring misfortune or even death. Also, if you are a child, be extra careful, because La Llorona is attracted to children, thinking they are hers. Since she thinks children are hers, she tries to drown them. Children should not walk alone around this river, just in case. Many parents in Mexico and Guatemala use this story to scare their children from staying out too late.  At the gates of heaven, she was challenged over the whereabouts of her children, and not permitted to enter the afterlife until she found them. Llorona is forced to wander the Earth for all eternity, searching in vain for her drowned offspring. She constantly weeps, hence her name ""La Llorona.""[2] She is caught between the living world and the spirit world.[3]",0,0,Hector Garcia,ojuqj8_wWo8,0.032548701298701285,2018-10-20 21:42:14,True,True

2018-12-19T02:02:22,"I believe that depending on what region u r from Mexico the story Changes. The main plot is always the same though Woman kills her children by drowning them due to some issue with a man and later regrets her actions and commits suicide and is in perpetual limbo on this earth seeking the souls of her lost children....     With that been said this was my mothers story to us about La Llorona My mother was From Mexico, Tlaxcala, San Buenaventura Attempa,      There once was a young woman whose husband had died and was widowed with 2 little children a little boy n girl. She was out on her fathers Corn/Maiz fields tending to them when a young man very elegantly dressed and handsome appeared on horse back. He seemed to be from a wealthy Family of the region that she knew of. She on the other hands was a humble mestiza campesina but very beautiful regardless. The story progresses to were the young man would go out to meet her at the fields everyday swearing to be madly in love with her as she was very hesitant to believe any of it in the beginning but in time she started to believe him. Untill finally they gave into there desires for each other. Not too long after her father finds out N forbids the relationship because the father knew of him n the lies he told young women to take advantage of them. The same lies he was telling his daughter now. The daughter did not beleive what the father was telling her about her luver so she goes out to find him in his home which was a large Hacienda of sorts there to her shock was a celebration going on for him and his fianc√© n there new engagement. He sees her at a distance and drags her out only to tell her to leave She in turns doesnt understand what's going on as he always promised her matrimony n his ‚ù§ to her. So he in order to quietly get rid of her tells her he tried to tell his family of her but that they forbade the relationship because she was poor with children. That her having children was a deal breaker basically for them but he really did love her but it was a shame she had kids so he couldn't marry her. He tells her to leave and he returns to his party. She on the other hand distraught and heart broken goes home and truelly believes that her children are the reason she can't be with her luver. So in the middle of the night she takes her children out to the lake by her home and drowns the little boy n girl. She then goes out the next day n buys a beautiful white wedding dress with the little money she had and seeks her luver to let him know of the good news. She finds him again at his home and he pulls her to the side before anyone spots her n tells her why was she there again to leave him alone if she did not understand that he cant be with her to which she says:""yes we can now for u see I have no children anymore."" To which he gets VERY ANGRY pulls her off of him and pushes her away hard to which she falls, and before she can finish saying what she had done, so he tells her: ""Are you that dumb n simple u do not understand I've NEVER loved u!! u were merely another conquest for me another pretty face n body to take care of my manly urges and that is all you will ever be to me or anyone worthless."". Then he says:"" if u ever appeare at my home again I will get the help to release the dogs on u or shoot u my self!"".He leaves her and she leaves in shambles as to the realization that she had been used n what she had done to the only ones that had ever loved her truelly, thats were the Known phrase is coined ""AY MIS HIJOS""(Oh my children) with so much pain n lament she cries out for her children regretting what she had done. So she goes to her fathers home grabs the shotgun he had, walks in her beautiful dress out to the lake were she murdered her children n shoots her self. Not long after her death the father tries to kill the young man that caused the death of his daughter n grandkids but he fails. The young mans family eitherway loose all there fortune during the Mexican civil revolution when Spain looses Mexico to the mestizos (as the young man was a Spaniard) so he himself becomes a poor beggar on the streets haunted but his own personal demons eitherway from the moment the young lady commits suicide and after the fathers death the towns ppl start hearing cries by the river banks of someone weaping for there children. And if ur brave enough, or stupid enough imo, to go look you can find a young woman crying in a wedding dress saying Mis hijos, aaaay mis hijos, donde estan mis hijos, (My children, oh my children Were are my children!?)Although anyone that has ever gone out to seek or meet her have either gone insane after encountering her or never returned SPEACIALY if u were a little kid.    Btw this scared the SHHH*t out of me when i was told this and was in Mexico as our family lives next to a river/creek..and close to a cementary and all the old aunts told me the exact same story as my mother. :S I never went outside at night there theres just too much bad juju around to even consider that üòÖüò≤üò∂    Well that's our families version I wonder what other ppls versions are?

En lo √∫nico que coinciden es que siempre que se deja ver se escucha un largo y aterrador grito: ¬´¬°Ay, mis hijos!¬ª.   Sobre el origen de esta leyenda hay varias versiones: una es la colonial, la cual se basa en las cr√≥nicas de Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, quien particip√≥ en la conquista del Imperio mexica. Se cuenta que una mujer de origen ind√≠gena era amante de un caballero espa√±ol y, cuando ella le pidi√≥ formalizar la relaci√≥n, √©l se neg√≥ porque pertenec√≠a a la alta sociedad. Este hecho desat√≥ la tragedia por la que su alma deambular√≠a en pena.    Cuentan que esa noche la mujer despert√≥ a sus peque√±os hijos ‚Äìun ni√±o y una ni√±a‚Äì, tom√≥ un pu√±al y los llev√≥ al r√≠o, el cual se encontraba muy cerca de su casa. Estando ah√≠, ciega por el coraje, los apu√±al√≥ varias veces hasta que los dej√≥ sin vida.

My wife is Spanish and Cuban and we will go see it anyway. What I do is compare it to the real legend, like a lot of people will. Then the people will know the real legend not the movies version.

Maria was also easily charmed by him and also accepted his proposal for marriage. He built a house just for them and later they had twins (a girl and a boy) At first, Kyle was very happy and showering Maria with gifts but later on he became angry often and became care less for Maria. Kyle went on one off his trips but one day he didn't come back. Maria got suspicious and waited every day but he never came. One day, Maria walks on the side of a lake with her kids and she points out some one and that some one is Kyle but she also sees another woman with him who looks more wealthier than Maria. Kyle asks the kids how everything is going and makes it very obvious that he ignores Maria. After Kyle goes off, Maria becomes angry and throws both of her kids in the lake.  She immediately realizes what she does and to as her punishment, she commits suicide, hoping to one day meet with her children and legend has it that if you go to that lake, you will here the weeping of ""La Llarona"" and children should be extra precautioned because she can think you are her kids and when she realizes you aren't, she will throw you in the lake.
