YOU CAN NOT TALK TO DEAD FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.. Lets make that clear..  They are called ""Familiar Spirits""  They may sound, look, act, like friends or relatives and tell you stuff only you and them knew but they are NOT your friends or relatives, they are demonic forces. All you are doing is opening up and giving dominion to these forces over you. Regardless of this movie, there are hundreds of thousands of cases over the years where people have been attacked and all sorts of evil they have encountered dabbling into this.

Research any guidelines on how to use the board. 3. Grab some friends, candles, and a video camera/smartphone or two (more cameras=more angles) 4. Find a creepy cemetery, abandoned church, or some creepy woods. 5. Draw a huge pentacle (a pentagram inside a circle) on the ground and light a candle on each point (while this is mostly to create a ritualistic atmosphere, it could possibly heighten the experience). 6. Sit inside the pentacle with your friends and the board. The cameras should be set up. 7. Start the Ouija board session; for maximum results, try to provoke evil spirits 8.

2014-10-30T18:50:47,"If Casper the friendly ghost appears, he is more than welcome to stay. All the other ones can go right back where they came from! I mean, ""normal"" life is hard enough as it is, without those ""frighteners"" keeping us up all night. We've got jobs and school to go to the next morning. None of this hanky-panky and creeping about in my or anyone else's house at this ungodly hour. But if they insist on being hard of hearing, I will sue him, her or it for ""disturbing of domestic peace"", and in case of more things going ""bump  in the night"", I shall play ""Get A Life"" by GoreFest ever so loudly. And then who will be sorry...? But all joking aside for a moment. When it comes to things we don't understand or can't explain, the best thing to do is to keep an open mind. Because until this very day, NOBODY has come up with the ultimate answer (or indeed the solution) to this ""strange"" and sometimes frightening phenomena we tend to call ""the occult"". Or is this just a simpleton's opinion? But when you take famous cases from the past, like for instance ""The Entity"" (a woman being haunted and repeatedly raped by an invisible being over many years), ""The Amityville Horror"" (a family being terrorized by ""something evil"" in a house where years ago a family was murdered) or even the ""paranormal"" activities that went on in ""Poltergeist""; did some of that ""scary stuff"" really happen, or was it all made up? Personally, I'm not saying yes. But I'm not saying no either. Because, as they say: ""there's more between heaven and earth"". And I wasn't there, when those people saw, hear, felt, or smelled anything out of ""the ordinary"". And although I like a good horrorfilm from time to time (because it usually deals with the things we really don't want to talk about, like death and our own mortality) the Greatest Thing a human being on this ""funny"""", ""little"" planet can posses is ofcourse...L O V E... And I like to think, probably THE most powerful force in any dimension or universe. So, if one day some ""evil spirit"" likes to play ""silly buggers"" with a person who has L O V E  in abundance in his or her life. Then he or she should confront ""the unknown"" by saying in a loud and steady voice: ""I've got L O V E to protect me..."" ""So bring it on!"" In short: If you do good in this world (without behaving like a total goody two shoes!) no real harm will come to you. Even if I'm fully aware that the most horrendous and tragic things happen to the nicest people among us. So, what does all of that teach us? That life isn't fair, and we all have to suffer at one time or another. But in the meantime, we try to do our utmost best to become a decent member of society, (again, without being a total goody two shoes!), love the people we love, and in the end leave our beloved earth behind with some sort of achievement.

The action of the board can be parsimoniously explained by unconscious movements of those controlling the pointer, a psychophysiological phenomenon known as the ideomotor effect. As in reflexive responses to pain, the body sometimes reacts reflexively to ideas alone without the person consciously deciding to take action. For instance, tears are produced by the body unconsciously in reaction to powerful emotions. The effects of automatic writing, dowsing, facilitated communication, and Ouija boards have been attributed to the phenomenon. Mystics have often attributed these effects to paranormal or supernatural force.

Some of the characters die off in ways that are never shown. Some become possessed and some don't. The ending makes no since whatsoever. I kept waiting for a shocking surprise or secret that reveals the power of the board or planchete which audiences have never seen...and surprise surprise same stuff that's been done before.

I wouldn't do it again, if I were too get paid??? totally but just for the heck of it nah. I did this with a couple of my friends when I was in the 7th grade, a couple of hours before Halloween, we stayed up all night playing the xbox and roasting each other then decided to do it . When we did it like the first 4 times nothing actually happened, but on the fifth attempt the room got cold and everybody thought it was the air cutting on, but we felt the vents and the heat was actually blowing. At this point we're still thinking it's a game not a big deal. So the sixth time we read from the paper and put all of our hands on the Ouija and I remember getting a little headache and I was looking around and I saw little blue and purple sparkles, like the ones you get when you get hit in the head or after a good workout. I thought I was the only person feeling and seeing this, so I looked at my friend Gera and he said I see little sparkling lights flying around the room and everybody else did too, the moment we all tried to take our hands off the little clip thingy it felt like we could move easily with no problem but we couldn't for like at least 5sec before actually letting go. We were all laughing and joking about it but I swear everybody felt a little sick like drained of energy, it wasn't even 10mins later that we all just went to sleep because we randomly got tired as hell.

You’re spelling out random words, even creepy words and sentences/phrases.   Basically the creepy writings coming from ouija board does NOT come from spiritual pressure or spirits, even demons. It’s coming from your own brain.  Here’s another slight explanation towards it:   You know when the light-bulb has gone in your room but even so when you enter your room you subconsciously flick the light switch?  The psychological effect that happens, the same with ouijas.  Or when you walk into a room forgetting what you went for? The same effect.  Maybe you wont know the true corruption of your mind until you use an ouija board. You’ll understand how idiosyncratic your brain works and how disturbing you truly can be.  And I’m stating that, when using ouija board, feeling possessed, or frightened? That’s more or less the placebo effect of having not known the psychology behind ouijas beforehand.

I've used the Ouija Board in a haunted hospital, haunted old castle, haunted school and also inside a cemetery- right in between the graves at midnight. I must've used the Ouija Board more than 100 times, with different people, different places, under different circumstances and also by myself... and nothin' ever happened. My moral of the story is; the Ouija Board is bullshit and so are all the ghost stories your grandmother tells you. All the stuff I've experienced and recorded (from slammin' doors to breakin' glass and strange noises) in haunted areas and buildings could be scientifically explained. Actually you don't even need science, you only need half a brain. From my opinion as an experienced veteran of this shit; spirits may exist but only in their own world. They cannot touch us, harm us or possess us... we cannot see them, feel them or hear them. ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU SOMETHIN' ELSE IS FULL OF SHIT! My conclusion is; 50% of people believe in ghosts based on stories they've heard from others and blindly believed, 20% make up stories for attention and believe their own stories, 20% genuinely believe in ghosts but they also believe in the toothfairy and Santa... and the last 10% are retarded.",0,0,atotheg1991,_T1Jj1inE8M,0.0468864468864469,2015-01-18 06:24:35,False,True
