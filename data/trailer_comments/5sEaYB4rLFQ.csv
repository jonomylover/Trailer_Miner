Hell by the time he met Tom Riddle he was already an old man. But the muggle world looks like it’s in the early 1930s which would probably be about 20-30 years before Dumbledore met Tom I think.

2018-03-13T20:26:13,"To all the people saying apparition onto the Hogwarts grounds is impossible:  You have to realize that the screenplay was written by Rowling herself. She is obviously aware of this rule, and moreover knows when this rule was established and why.   Furthermore, a lot of thought is put into the creation of a trailer: what to include and what to omit. This means that every scene included in this trailer has been carefully selected. The creators chose to show us the apparition right at the beginning. They could've skipped ahead a second and just showed us some Wizards walking toward Hogwarts instead, but they didn't.  They're aware of the rule and yet include it in the trailer. This means that this was done on purpose, to make us, the viewers, wonder why this could be possible.

2018-03-14T00:09:38,"I imagine a time when Warner Bros and Rowling, decide to make a Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff movie. Time could run before, during and just after the previous movies with Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the Slytherin people, but would show how Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs are the unsung heroes of that time, tipping events toward balance or to a more favorable outcome. Imagine during a scene from that movie, viewers see Harry, Ron, and Hermione, in the background, running off in some direction, but learning how the efforts of these new characters set things on track to what would be the eventual outcome. It would be interesting to see Hogwarts from a different perspective, to learn about those two houses, to see the arrival of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and all the characters we know, and to see how things carried on after the final Potter movie. Not only could it be a movie, but a whole new series of books, that would entertain a whole new generation of fans, while not neglecting long time fans.

2018-03-14T02:16:36,"As much as i love harry potter, COME ON, people, i really wish this trailer didnt have the most generic title cards ever. “Who will stand” And “Against the darkness” .... You might as well say: “In a world”, or  “the epic saga continues” or  “From the director of suicide squad” I dunno, i feel like generic ass title cards take away from trailers. Nothing turns me off more than having a trailer preach to me that “dark will battle light” or that “only one can save...us...now”. It feels silly, or no? Anyways im gonna watch this so whats the point. But the trailers pretty generic and i wish it would be more than another overly intense tailer with rousing orchestra music and the done to death: “here comes a big bad duude and they gotta fight him/stand against evilllll”  ""They went back to Hogwarts, brought back at least two amazing characters (brilliant cat selection), the CGI is looking better than ever, and the story alone looks awesome."" I agree completely. Im not even remotely saying that i'm not exited for the movie. Im expressing my wishes that for a movie (and the previous fantastic beasts, i guess) that is a return to such an incredible story universe, with complex characters and amazing lore, that the trailer would be just as grand. Im literally only saying that the trailer text is bland. Hell, i don't expect that much from any trailers, but it saddens me to see it here too. (I love this series too much for it to keep getting bad scores as well, screw those move critics, on a other note.)  There. It has nothing to do with harry potter, the series, the ignorance of life in the universe or hatred of any such thing.",46,10,Wascarito,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.15101626016260167,2018-03-14 02:16:36,True,True

I'd really love to see Beauxbatons (with its co-ed students and not all female like the GoF movie strangely suggested...), but we didn't see Ilvermorny in the first one, so I doubt it. It'll get name dropped, though. And movie 3 will likely take place in Norway or Sweden and name drop Durmstrang, hopefully with some female students.  Considering nearly every spell (except, perhaps, the killing curse) has to be done with a flourish, I don't see how keeping wands aimed at someone is supposed to mean anything. They're not guns.

At number 9, Eminem, but really early Eminem cuz that new shit is trash ya know? Like womb level shit. He was dropping some hot fire in his mother’s belly. Alright and of course number 8, which is of course 3pac, don’t even gotta say anything about this legend, RIP. Numba 7, Big Big, he was always the biggest rapper with the biggest house, biggest bitches, biggest bucks ya know. At number 6, Ekans, which is just snake fucking backwards. However, is rhymes are venomous and he was notorious for being the best freestyle rapper of 1876. Speaking if notorious, #5 is Nutritious HIV, giving you your healthy dose of aids every so often from the rhymes he spat. Ironically he was killed by a car that Freddie Mercury was driving, and after which Freddie killed himself by drinking mercury, but they cover it up and say he had aids. At number 4, we got Past The Rappist, he was considered the first rapper to eat ten dicks and still survive. At numba 3, we got Kanye West, who is widely known as the first Homosexual rapper, which paved way for my second rapper, Frank Sea. I mean Frank, his rhymes may be as salty as the... ocean, but damn do they destroy the rap scene. And finally, numba 1, is obviously Fire Sphere, a new rapper with fiery flow and is now considered the first rapper to be openly asexual.",0,0,Cynical Sins,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.043674242424242435,2018-03-14 02:51:26,True,True

As we learn in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, the headmaster resides with the power to lift the enchantment on any area of the castle at anytime. Thus, that is why they have apparation lessons in the great hall.  For those of you who actually rememeber the book, but still want to put up a stink, the reason for Dumbledore and Harry traveled to Hogsmead to disapparate was for security purposes. Since Dumbledore did not know how long he would be away, and also knew Malfoy was trying to plot something, he didnt want to leave that gate open.   If you still have an issue with it... Get bent.

2018-03-14T03:48:58,"Guys... have you noticed how wicked and dire the world is becoming as of late?  Take a moment and consider the state of our world:   -The Middle East is at the tipping point.   -The world hates Israel.   -There is a growing demand for a one world economic, political, and religious system.   -There are wars and rumors of war (especially in regards to World War 3).   -Racism is some of the worst it's ever been.   -Hatred and madness is spilling over into riots in the streets.   -Perversion is running rampant.   -The weather is out of control.   -We're mutilating unborn children and mistakenly believing we have a ""right"" to do so.   -Education is in the toilet.   -Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are happening in more and more diverse places at a highly alarming rate.  ... You getting the picture? Something is deeply wrong with our world.  None of what you see going on in the world is normal or good. In fact, much of what you see happening around the globe coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says many of these things would occur before Christ returns. You can investigate it for yourself. The Bible says in the last days there will be: wars and rumors of war; a one world economic/governmental/religious system; Kingdoms against kingdoms and the seas and people raging; Violence and perversion on a grand scale; Earthquakes in diverse places, etc.  ... Sounds *exactly* like our world today, doesn't it? If that weren't enough to chew on, consider this: The Books of John and Acts combined total up to over 120+ historically verified facts. When you consider that, it gets a little difficult to write the Bible off as fairy tales when history and archaeology are on its side...  *Are you paying attention yet?* God is *screaming* at us! He warned us thousands of years in advance that all of what you are seeing would happen- and it is! It's all coming together to the letter! In fact, if you doubt the validity of Bible Prophecy, I encourage you to consider this: the Bible warns that in the last days that Damascus will become ""a ruinous heap."" It will become a no man's land inhabited by no one. Use that as a litmus test of sorts. Keep an eye on Damascus. If it never falls then feel free to throw out the Bible. But when Damascus does fall in the not too distant future... You'll see God is no liar. God also declares that the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus as your Savior. Good deeds won't get you there nor do good deeds erase a bad deed. If you murder somebody, that person is still dead even if you do nothing but good deeds after murdering them. You need a Savior who will forgive you of that murder because you can't save yourself.  Yet, many people will still discount God and His goodness even when shown evidence that the Bible is valid and coming true. A lot of people have difficulty believing in God because of all the evils in the world. However, this discounting of the only Person who can save you may be less of an inborn frustration or complaint and more of a hidden longing, placed there by the very One who planted His own image into the body and soul of every person He created. Where does this deep-seated intuition that suffering and pain are not right come from if we're just amalgamations of atoms, as the atheists say…?  What if, perhaps, this intuition points to something deeper? Something built into ourselves that reflects our true nature and identity? What if this revulsion against suffering and pain is a reminder of paradise, on one hand, and an anticipation of New Jerusalem on the other?  Perhaps it's the cry of the human spirit for God. For our Creator. The only One who can, and will, fix this mess.  As I've said, time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, ""You're just being paranoid like all the other fundamentalists. Haven't we always had these types of problems?"" Sure... But never at this magnitude or frequency! Check the news for yourselves. The amount of earthquakes, bloodshed, madness and horrific weather events are off the charts! Don't be deceived into thinking it's not as bad as it seems out there. The devil wants you to stay anemic and apathetic. Don't let that jerk deceive you. Or win your soul. Satan wants nothing more than for you to roll your eyes, scoff under your breath and put this whole ""God"" business under the rug. He wants you to continue believing that Hell and God and the afterlife is nonsense. That the Bible is all fairy tale nonsense of Jesus riding dinosaurs; that it's stuff only the weak-minded, brainwashed people believe. He'll gladly coax your pride, making you believe you're far too ""reasoned"" to believe in such things. However, Satan believes the Bible. Every jot and word of it. He doesn't see it as fairy-tale nonsense since it details his coming destruction. He just doesn't want YOU to believe it so he can drag your soul down with him when it's time for him to go!  Don't let him drag you down into the grave with him. Don't be played! Hell is a very real place-- a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. A-L-O-N-E. In the dark. Miserable for all eternity. If hell wasn't real, what on earth was Jesus willing to die for to protect us from...? Bill Nye thinks hell won't be so bad; he claims he's willing to hold onto his darwinian beliefs even if it means he's hellbound for it. I hope you won't share in that kind of disillusioned thinking...  Before you're sent to hell, you'll appear at the Great White Throne Judgment. Whether you believe in hell or not makes no difference--that giant throne you want to avoid seeing at all costs will be your destiny if Christ isn't your Savior. At the Great White Throne Judgment the books are thrown wide open and the past is recalled. Details and sins long forgotten or covered up are brought to light. Plenty of people will have a list of good deeds: acts of charity, love, and sacrifice. All their good deeds will be carefully considered... but none of them will be good enough to gain them admittance into heaven. The good deeds they did will have an impact on where they end up in the lake of fire, however. Hell will not be the same for everyone, but it will still be eternal misery... misery you could have easily avoided.  Sinners will wish they had done just a little less evil so their punishment could be a little more tolerable. Pornographers will wish they hadn't made so many videos. Control freaks will wish they hadn't been so angry and abusive. The internet troll will wish he hadn't cursed and slung so many demeaning insults toward a stranger online. And the abortionist will wish they hadn't killed any pre-born infants. All sins will be exposed. There's no way out... unless...  Unless you accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you're a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His free gift of salvation and grace. It's all yours... free for the taking! Jesus is the only way to get out of what's coming soon upon this world. I know you've probably heard ""Jesus loves you"" a million times in your life, and it probably sounds like an empty mantra by now... but it really is the truth! Do you know why you exist? Have you ever stopped and pondered about that...? Nothing in this life comes to be without God's approval first. That means that God thought  you were so worth the effort that He created you!  Or maybe you're wondering, ""How do I know that only Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or what about Hinduism or Buddhism? How do I know that the Bible isn't a book of fiction and myths? In fact, what about all the starving kids in Africa? If God is so ""just and loving,"" explain that one!"" These are incredibly valid questions that deserve real answers. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with?  If you have deep questions related to God, or if you're just remotely curious about Him... I encourage you to search out these authors. I'll even list some of their books that address just about any issue or question you could have about God:  Frank Turek- ""Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case""  Andreas Kostenberger- ""Truth Matters""  Louis Markos- ""Apologetics for the 21st Century""  Norman L. Geisler- ""When Skeptics Ask,"" ""I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist""  C.S. Lewis- ""Mere Christianity""  Lee Strobel- ""The Case For Christ,"" ""The Case For A Creator,"" ""The Case For Grace""  Ravi Zacharias- ""The End of Reason,"" ""Jesus Among Other Gods,"" ""Can Man Live Without God?"" ""Why Suffering?""  Philip Yancey- ""Reaching For The Invisible God,"" ""Disappointment With God""  Also, the ""One Minute Apologist"" right here on YouTube offers quick videos that tackle tough questions about God.  **  Why am I telling you all this? Especially when this has absolutely nothing to do with the video you're watching? Simple: to warn you. To offer you a life line. Deep down, if you have discernment and common sense, you can tell something is dreadfully wrong with this world and something in your heart is telling you to get right with God before it's too late. Don't ignore that voice! Listen to it, no matter how small it is. I'm just a beggar telling other beggars where they can go to find the Bread of Life.  Don't let anything stop you from finding God. To quote Erwin Lutzer: ""Standing at the Great White Throne Judgment will be hordes from every country of the world, from every religion in the world, with the best intentions in the world. They will learn too late that God is serious about justice, and if Christ does not bear their punishment, they must bear their own.""  Don't lose your life! Let Christ save you while there's still time.",0,0,OtterloopB,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.08249744769119773,2018-03-14 03:48:58,True,True

I do not approve). He was literally in the trailer for 5 seconds and here I am rewinding to the part 5 times. DUMBLEDORE WHAT IS IT WITH YOU PUTTING YOUNG MEN IN DANGER JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE TO MUCH OF A SCARED OLD LADY TO FACE THEM YOURSELF?! I mean I get it, Grindelwald is your lover and you love him like a lot but for Christ sake leave my Newt alone he is the only Hufflepuff I have really connected with given that it is my house he is the one that made me realize and accept that Hufflepuff is badass. Just please let him be okay and live to see another day. Also I really hope that Colin Farrell returns but probably not because this director hates me. He has to be alive, the only way for Grindelwald to become him is if he was still alive, polyjuice potion only works on people who are alive, Grindelwald had to have him stashed away to keep getting hairs off of him. I don't think there is any other way for Grindelwald to turn into Graves other than polyjuice potion. I have studied this trailer like it is my job.

2018-03-14T08:59:16,"Why didn't the ""wizards"" just cast themselves out of the dullest franchise in the history of movie franchises? Seriously each episode following the boy wizard and his pals from Hogwarts Academy as they fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others. Aside from the gloomy imagery, the series’ only consistency has been its lack of excitement and ineffective use of special effects, all to make magic unmagical, to make action seem inert.  Perhaps the die was cast when Rowling vetoed the idea of Spielberg directing the series; she made sure the series would never be mistaken for a work of art that meant anything to anybody?just ridiculously profitable cross-promotion for her books. The Harry Potter series might be anti-Christian (or not), but it’s certainly the anti-James Bond series in its refusal of wonder, beauty and excitement. No one wants to face that fact. Now, thankfully, they no longer have to.  >a-at least the books were good though  ""No!"" The writing is dreadful; the book was terrible. As I read, I noticed that every time a character went for a walk, the author wrote instead that the character ""stretched his legs.""  I began marking on the back of an envelope every time that phrase was repeated. I stopped only after I had marked the envelope several dozen times. I was incredulous. Rowling's mind is so governed by cliches and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing. Later I read a lavish, loving review of Harry Potter by the same Stephen King. He wrote something to the effect of, ""If these kids are reading Harry Potter at 11 or 12, then when they get older they will go on to read Stephen King."" And he was quite right. He was not being ironic. When you read ""Harry Potter"" you are, in fact, trained to read Stephen King.",0,0,DarthLeapyous,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.034986772486772476,2018-03-14 08:59:16,True,True

2018-03-14T09:13:56,"Dear friends you may feel lonely and lost in this big world, but just know you are NEVER alone. Jesus Christ always have been and will always be with you on this earth. He is all around you, hovering over you even as you seek Him. He is nearer than you dare believe, closer than the air you breathe. If His children could only recognize His presence, they would never feel lonely again. Jesus knows every thought before you think it, every word before you speak it. His presence impinges on your innermost being. Can you see the absurdity of trying to hide anything from Him? You can easily deceive other people, and even yourself; but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whom loves you so much, can read you like an open book, large print.                                                                                                            Deep within themselves, most people have some awareness of Jesus imminent presence. Many people run from Him and vehemently deny His existence, because the closeness of Jesus terrifies them. But His own children have nothing to fear, for Jesus Christ have cleansed them by His blood and clothed them in His righteousness. Be blessed by His intimate nearness. Since Jesus lives in you, let Him also live through you, shining LIGHT into darkness. Become one with Christ by telling Him you will give you life to Him this very moment. Repent and as Him to forgive you of your sins. Believe in Him, have Faith in Him and allow Him to lead and guide you in EVERY aspect of your life. Jesus Christ's love for you can't be measured or described using mere words. It is deep, eternal, and special just for you. ❤️❤️❤️ (Psalm 139:1-4;  Ephesians 2:13;  2 Corinthians 5:21)",0,0,msdogooder,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.16267264481550198,2018-03-14 09:13:56,True,True

2018-03-14T12:45:41,"Edit  Grindelwald was born around 1883. He is the grand-nephew of Bathilda Tourdesac.  In the story of Harry Potter, it is said that in their youth, Gellert Grindelwald and Albus Dumbledore were great friends who planned together to lead the world of wizards and muggles when they were adults.  In 1899, while traveling abroad, Gellert Grindelwald met Albus Dumbledore at Godric's Hollow after he returned there after the death of his mother, Kendra Dumbledore. Grindelwald is then hosted by her great-aunt Bathilda Tourdesac. She is the one who puts him in touch with Albus Dumbledore. Quickly the two wizards become friends and begin to exchange letters, especially to talk about their common project. This project is to remove the International Code of Secret Magic, a series of articles designed to hide the existence of the magical world from muggles, in order to establish a wizarding dominion over muggles. This project is primarily carried by Grindelwald. But aware of the affection that Albus Dumbledore has for him, he does not hesitate to manipulate him in order to carry out his ideas.  During Grindelwald and Dumbledore's reflections on the power they wish to hold, the two friends come to take an interest in the Deathly Hallows, whose possession would have allowed them to become masters of Death. Fascinated by this desire, Albus Dumbledore abandons his sister Ariana and her brother Abelforth Dumbledore. One day Abelforth challenges Grindelwald to fight because he is fed up with his brother's ""absence"". Albus tries to intervene between his brother and his best friend and ends up siding with Abelforth. A spell accidentally hits Ariana who dies of it without ever knowing which one had sent the mortal attack. This ends the fight but also the friendship between Albus and Gellert, who will not see each other until many years later, in 1945, when Albus Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald (who had become a terrible dark wizard) in a duel. 1]. Grindelwald was shut up in the Nurmengard prison he had built for his enemies. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, we learn more about the reasons for his breakup with Dumbledore; he is also wanted by Voldemort to give him the Elder Wand. He is finally killed by Voldemort himself in early 1998, when he understands that the Wand is no longer in his possession since his fight against Dumbledore.",0,0,Gastor,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.11344696969696971,2018-03-14 12:45:41,True,True

That was kinda fine because it was said in an interview not in the books.. But in the Harry Potter books its clearly mentioned that Dumbeldore alone fought Grindewald and captured the Elder Wand.. So are you people taking a U-turn on this point and adding your dear Newt Scamander in the final showdown?

2018-03-14T16:43:33,"Wakeup people. Y'all need Jesus. This world; Its ALL biblical. We are the last generation. Evil is rampant because Satan knows his time is coming to a close he is trying hard to drag all to hell with him. He's doing a fine job. You do not wanna be here when God pours out his anger on all the wicked who refuse to aknowledge his reality. He is VERY REAL. People are all in a deep sleep and care only about being entertained ""trying"" to be famous and shopping in strip malls and listening to terrible satanically inspired music etc. It's a totally Godless world and all will be totally surprised when Jesus comes and they get left to deal with Satan in reality with all his demons which instead of being invisible will be completely visible to the naked eye. Only then will people believe this world is all one giant spiritual battle. But then it will sadly be too late. We all know Jesus died for us, loves us, and wants us to escape hell which is an actual place. But so many try to ignore this simple truth and do what they want thinking they will get away with their wicked unholy behaviors. God sees ALL. Even the things you ""think"" you are doing in secret. You can't run or hide from the ONE who made you and all creation. Don't be a fool.   Toss aside this temporary world. If you do not know Jesus Christ or believe in God, I urge you to start. Whether you believe or not does not change the fact that The One and Only Jesus Christ is on his way....shortly. Like days. How many? Not sure. But my spirit feels it. And many others around the world know it too and are awake spiritually. This world is extremely messed up. You must admit that. Its all a lie...all the things you ""think"" make you happy are lies. The devil hates you and is laughing at you. Jesus loves you. He died for you and the entire world. Even if you don't  love him. He is waiting for you to receive him in your heart. He is a gentleman...He WILL NOT enter your heart unless YOU ask him to! If you are ready to receive Jesus into your heart pray this prayer before (preferably out loud) it's too late. This is an urgent warning. Pray: Jesus I am a sinner, I believe you died on the cross for me and my sins and rose from the dead. I confess you as my Lord and Savior RIGHT NOW. Please forgive me of all my sins I am repenting now and I ask you to enter my heart at this moment. Change me. I want to make you happy. I want to be rescued and go to heaven. I do not want to be stuck in the tribulation. Help me to open my spiritual eyes and ears before you get here. I ask this in Jesus name Amen!   If you just prayed this prayer Welcome to the Family! You made the most important decision of your life right now. Eternity is forever. We all go somewhere when we die. You choose where that is. God does not. Don't stop repenting(asking God to forgive you when you mess up) and praying is very important too. Prayer changes things and is powerful! And remember a prayer can be a simple as ""Jesus, help me!"" Now get a bible or an app and read about Revelation. We are in the part about the 6th seal. Prophecies are happening rapidly in our time like no other generation. And also read Matthew and John books... For a start. I pray you made the right decision and prayed that prayer. See you in heaven shortly!💛💛😘👏👍😊",0,3,BowDown2ChristJesus.Mmmkay.,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.0831753246753247,2018-03-14 16:43:33,True,True

2018-03-14T20:07:56,"(The Spirit of Truth/Holy Spirit, the world does not know because, they can't see it, but the believers do know because, it lives inside of us):  (Jesus):  Even the Spirit of truth;  whom the world cannot receive,  because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him;  for (he) (dwelleth with you), and shall be (in you).  I will not leave you comfortless/orphans:  (I) will (come) (to) (you).  (John 14:17-18).  ***The Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Truth. (John 15:26)<---But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me). (1 John 4:6)<---We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error).  ***Because he is truth and guides us into all truth.  ***(1 Corinthians 2:13)<---Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.  ***(2 Peter 1:21)<---For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.  ***The Spirit of God is active in the world, but his acts go unnoticed by the world.  ***(1 Corinthians 2:14)<---But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ (Jesus warning about HELL FIRE):   And if thy hand causes you to sin, cut it off:   it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell,   into the fire that never shall be quenched:   Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.   (Mark 9:43-44).   ***(Cut if off): Should be taken figuratively; it means to take whatever drastic action is necessary to avoid sin.   ***The imagery of Hell (Frequently called gehenna) comes from a garbage dump outside the walls of Jerusalem. Jesus hearers were familiar with the smoldering fires that always burned there.   ***(((Obedience))) and (((self-control))) are necessary to overcome sin.   ***The longing of the disciples for greatness needed to be reshaped according to God's purposes.",0,0,mlzanercik,5sEaYB4rLFQ,-0.03489583333333331,2018-03-14 20:07:56,True,True

The themes don't stick out. For example, can you hum or whistle the Iron Man theme? How about the Captain America theme?), and the muted colors which drown out each other instead of stick like the original Harry Potter movies. In an earlier post I mentioned that these movies are becoming Marvelized  - and they are! Look at all of the above.

2018-03-14T21:13:40,"This might just be me, but instead of mixing interesting magical beasts with over the top action, why not make the Magical Beasts series a documentary style movie where we spend 90+ minutes watching various magical animals in their natural habitat and what they do? Documentaries like Planet Earth and Blue Planet is a big success, people will flock to see that and I’d pay double to see David Attenborough narrating it. Not to mention the Fantastic Beasts book was an encyclopaedia of all the creatures found in the Harry Potter universe, why not translate what it covers to the big screen and make it 100 times more interesting?  Then you can have your giant multi movie franchise following Grindelwald and Dumbledore’s past, without the need to shoehorn a needless story that seems to be a side issue in the face of the actual story. Two separate Harry Potter franchises that people would flock to see.

The fucking pacing of the last film was atrocious, so much so that I had a headache trying to keep up with what the hell was going on half the time.  It would cut here, then there, with minor things happening in each that gives vital information.  Unless you have as much focus as GOD HIMSELF you're likely watching the first film guaranteed to miss one or two important bits of information because of the pacing.  First they're fighting with wands, now they're summoning a shield, now someone rolls under the shield, oh someone got pushed into the tracks, the sound of a train blares.  The person is rescued before we even see the train.  See what I mean?  - Develop the fucking characters more.  Make me care for them and make them memorable.

2018-03-15T00:14:28,"Some information about Dumbledore and Grindelwald (mainly Dumbledore) that I can remember from the books, for those who are interested: (Spoilers, by the way. Probably.)   Dumbledore was a half-blood, but both his parents were wizards. He had a younger brother named Aberforth, and a younger sister (the youngest) named Ariana. At a young age, Ariana was attacked by a group of muggle boys, leaving her mentally and magically unstable. Albus's father, Percival Dumbledore, attacked them in retaliation, for which he was imprisoned in Azkaban. Afterward, Albus's mother, Kendra Dumbledore, moved the family to Godric's Hollow (where Harry's parents lived).  In Hogwarts, Albus became known for his magical skill, replacing his reputation as the son of a muggle hater. In his seventh year, he made plans to travel the world. After his graduation, however, his mother Kendra was killed by a magical outburst from Ariana, leaving him the resentful head of his family of himself, his younger brother, and his unstable younger sister.  Gellert Grindelwald later visited Godric's Hollow, researching the three legendary deathly hollows. Dumbledore became fascinated by Grindelwald's ideas, which included concepts of wizard superiority. (According to a tweet from JK Rowling, Dumbledore held romantic feelings toward Grindelwald).  However, in his interaction with Grindelwald, Dumbledore had neglected Aberforth and Ariana for many weeks. Aberforth confronted Dumbledore and Grindelwald, saying that he couldn't go through with the plans because he would have to take Ariana with them. Grindelwald cast the cruciatus curse on him, and a fight broke out between the three of them.  When Ariana appeared and tried to intervene (failing due to her erratic magical abilities), she was hit with a stray curse and died. Grindelwald fled, and Albus and Aberforth's relationship never repaired, Aberforth forever resenting Albus over what happened. Albus felt great regret and guilt over the tragedy for the rest of his life. Albus returned to Hogwarts as a professor of transfiguration. He taught influential students such as Newt Scamander and Tom Riddle. Albus was distrustful of Tom through all of his school years in a way that none of the other teachers ever were. When a creature came from the chamber of secrets, petrifying multiple students and killing Myrtle, Dumbledore suspected Tom, though Rubeus Hagrid was convicted for the attack.  During this time, however, Gellert Grindelwald was still at large, gaining power and followers. He had also successfully obtained one deathly hollow, the elder wand. Eventually, Dumbledore tracked Grindelwald down and fought him in a duel which would become legendary. Dumbledore won, taking the elder wand for himself (though, this was not known to the wizarding public). Dumbledore was awarded The Order of Merlin (first class) for this deed. Dumbledore was later appointed headmaster of Hogwarts. Grindelwald became the sole prisoner of Nurmengard, a prison which he had created himself for the confinement of his enemies, where he was eventually killed by Voldemort.",0,0,The Shiny Snivy,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.14501133786848072,2018-03-15 00:14:28,True,True

You can’t expect him to be exactly the same. I mean the guy used to be a pureblood elitist. That right there tells you that he’s been a different person at different points of his life. (And isn’t this movie after he gave up on Grindewald and is probably freaking pissed and depressed. He’s just had the worst breakup of his life, he’s allowed to be sad that his Best friend chose to be a Dark Lord over staying with him)  PS also when you’re as old as Dumbledore is in the Harry Potter books and you’re the most powerful wizard in the world, you do what you want- including wearing purple sparkly robes and putting a giant Man-eating 3-headed monster dog in a school full of small children  PPS also 50-year-old Dumbledore probably had a boss somewhere.

2018-03-15T05:07:01,"Some people are questioning how the people Apparated onto Hogwarts grounds and here’s my take on it-The enchantment could very well have been lifted for the Minister at the time, for his convenience because of the dangerous situation. It was most likely a one-time event, too. In the Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore is seen doing this while flying into the castle with Harry, muttering the counter spells to undo his wall of protection so that he and Harry could get in. The enchantment was also lifted during the sixth years’ Apparition practice—admittedly only in the Entrance Hall, but lifted within Hogwarts nonetheless. The Minister could also not even have Apparated inside school grounds—he Apparated onto a bridge, and the school boundaries are at the gates, with the two winged boars. This is proved by Snape being able to Apparate  just at the gates when fleeing Harry and the castle,—in the Half-Blood Prince—with Buckbeak circling the open gates. There’s also the possibility that the school boundaries were extended to the bridge, after these events and for extra precautions. Then there’s the last thing, the most likely scenario, but also the one that I dearly hope isn’t true. The case where there was a mistake in there, something that slipped their mind and made it into the trailer. Then again, this is just the trailer, and we’ll just have to wait and see if it’s in the actual movie. Also, why is nobody freaking out over the fact that JACOB is in there?! The Muggle, who was Obliviated! Yes, there are little signs of him remembering his adventures, what with his bakery creations and his faint memory of Queenie, but I seriously doubt he could recall everything. Even if he did, there’s the whole issue of why he got Obliviated in the first place. Risk of exposure of the Wizarding World, leading to extreme danger for them. How did the MACUSA approve of his involvement?! Do they even KNOW of his involvement? If not, then the threesome is breaking Wizarding Law!",409,21,Audrey Liang,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.03599232456140352,2018-03-15 05:07:01,True,True

2018-03-16T05:09:03,"To anyone who is complaining about the how this movie features creatures not in the book, first off, I do not own the book but my understanding is that it is supposed to be a replica of Newt Scamander's book Fantastic Beast and Where to find them, and you may correct me if I am wrong, ofcourse. That being said I believe that book was supposed to be published by Newt in the timeframe that is BETWEEN the first Fantasic Beasts and the second movie, meaning he may very well have not encountered or even known about many of the animals he finds or owns during the second movie, as magical beast were very rare  in Newts lifespan, being as they were misunderstood and aggressively hunted by wizards in order to keep them from exposing the wizard ing world and magic to Muggles. Given that we in our own world are still discovering new species every year that we never knew of or were thought to be extinct and that's with thousands of scientists working globally together whereas Newt seemed to be one of a very small group of wizards interested in magical creatures and possibly the ONLY one in his time who studied them to the extent he did, it's not terribly unlikely he not only did not know about several of them, but may have never even known about ones that are known of by the time Harry Potter is at Hogwarts",0,1,Shelley Seemayer,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.13339015151515152,2018-03-16 05:09:03,True,True

2018-03-16T09:47:22,This is a rebuttal to all the people blindly defending this trailer because its linked to Harry Potter   Firstly people are saying that  the person playing Dumbledore is a perfect fit for the role but there’s one major problem in my opinion. I’m sure he’s fine as an actor but for me his accent just doesn’t fit the character.   Also people are defending the way the characters are dressed but it just makes no sense. Wizards aren’t meant to know how to dress normally ( literally in the books one of them ends up wearing swim wear when they try dressing like a muggle ) so why is everyone walking around in a suit and tie ?!? Wizards are meant to wear cloaks and robes but the clothing the director has picked for this movie just seems really out of place.  Although I disagree with a look of the choices it will still be nice to see Hogwarts again.,37,16,annana moose,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.3196969696969697,2018-03-16 09:47:22,True,True

2018-03-17T06:28:54,"Honestly, (and I prepare myself in advance for the negative reactions) I’d lost interest by the end of the HP series. Not saying they weren’t good, just saying they no longer captured my attention. Didn’t read or see Deathly Hallows, and I’ve been told what happens so probably never will. But my nieces dragged me along to see Fantastic Beasts and I fell in love all over again. It put a new twist and a new energy into the franchise. I thought it was going to be a one off (like Rogue One) so I’m thrilled they’ve made a sequel.   And again want to point out, that I am not saying later HP books and movies were bad.

2018-03-17T17:33:49,"So... 0:09 tells us that this visit is important, so important that the current headmaster allowed the ministry to apperate on Hogwarts grounds. 0:20 But Dumbledore didn't know about it yet. In the following scenes, we do see that Newt has the Deluminator that we first saw in the Harry Potter books as Dumbledore possession, did Dumbledore give it to Newt or was it Newt's first and Dumbledore got it from him? 0:35 This looks French so I think we can assume Dumbledore is in Paris as well. 0:49 This looks like an audience so I think the people in the room are Grindelwald's followers, however, what's much more interesting is the glass boll in the hands of the witch next to him. It has been confirmed that Grindelwald is a seer so that might mean two things. 1. that is an actual glass boll for seeing the future. 2. it is a prophecy, like; that person will do this. Similar to the Prophecy between Harry and Voldemort, that was stored in such a ball as well. 0:53 It looks like Tina is in conflict, it is said that she has to pick a side so it's safe to presume that she doesn't know who she had to be loyal to, does she know/care about a follower of Grindelwald. (Perhaps Credence joined Grindelwald) 0:58 there is no mention of this beast on Pottermore or in the Original FBAWTFT textbook. However, it resembles the Fwooper closest.   1:06 Here we have Credence and the Snake girl. It is believed that she is cursed to slowly transform into a Snake, a popular theory is that she will eventually turn into Nagini.  1:11 the dancing girl might be Veela and Leta Lestrange is in the Audience. 1:14 The creature might be a Kelpie, thought France is not the Kelpie's original habitat. The Person on it's back doesn't appear to have taken Gillyweed nor has used another visible spell to breathe underwater. They seem to be fleeing. 1:15 The Lestrange family tree, people claim that Credence is visible on the tree but I can't see it. 1:20 Newt in a circus, probably there to free the creatures? 1:22 An Angry Credence, wanting to hurt the creatures in the cage, knows the Snake girl from 1:06 probably through this circus. Someone may have hurt his feelings, perhaps the snake girl or did he feel like Newt/Tina let him down? 1:27 a coach pulled by thestrals, two men in there who I can't recognise but perhaps send by Dumbledore? 1:35 Why does it have to be Newt? Just because there is no one else or was I right and was there indeed a prophecy? 1:50 As I've been pointing out for months now... the 'I' is the wand, the 'G' is the Stone, and the 'A' is the cloak...",0,0,Marieke Elzer,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.1592960023515579,2018-03-17 17:33:49,True,True

This CGI just looks like I'm watching a Pixar movie lol. Also the third shot of Hogwarts looks so fake and calculated like it was taken directly off of the last hp movie and WHAT is that apperation CGI LOL. David Yates ruined the potter movies and can he seriously piss off and give another director a chance?

2018-03-18T02:22:30,"Can we get a movie about the Mauderers, Snape and the original Order of Phoenix too. For me their story during their time is really really interesting. They can show Tom Riddle slowly becoming evil and ultimately be Voldemort. I wanna see Sirius and James friendship. Snape and Lily's friendship and eventual fall out. And the formation of the original Order of Phoenix to fight against Voldemort during his first rise to power. They can end the movie with Voldemort killing James and Lily and then trying to kill Harry just for it to back fire at him. So that the movie will connect with the start of the Harry Potter series.   I think the Mauderers are really fun and interesting bunch of friends. They deserve their own movie even if their story ended in tragedy. Even if the ending of the movie will be James dying, Sirius framed and jail in Azkaban, Peter betrayal and siding w/ the dark lord and Lupin still being discriminated because he is a warewolf, it will still be a great story and I will still watch it.

(theoretically), becoming prefect, Head Boy, etc. That friend is also as bright as you. Then that said friend theorized that there would be a better world if wizards rule Muggles ""For The Greater Good."" You learn that he came from Durmstrang. He had a bit of a bad history from that school. Doing things that will really expell anyone who did it. You, of course, came from Hogwarts. You accepted your new friend's theory and started planning. You and your friend also started finding the three Hallows, becoming master of death. But those plans may not happen since you have a very sick sister (you being the head of the family since your mom and dad died). Your younger brother hears about this plan and started arguing. Your friend got too angry and the three of you (you, your brother and your friend) started fighting. Then someone's spell hit you sister, leading her to her death. The three of you were not sure who had hit her, but you're sure that you had hit her. You friend ran away, suddenly disappearing. With grief, you become a good person to hide what had happened. You learn that having power is not for you. You then become a professor at Hogwarts. A new Dark Lord appeared and that the wizarding community thinks that you are the only powerful wizard enough to defeat this new dark lord. But you learn that the dark wizard was the friend you met when you were seventeen. You are too scared to duel with him because of your history with him. But soon you will have to battle him.

What would you feel if you are Dumbledore, fighting his old friend Grindelwand but too scared because of the death of your younger sister, Arianna, and the anger of your brother Aberforth?",0,0,Stringy Strings,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.036350649350649404,2018-03-18 07:21:07,True,True

2018-03-19T14:48:51,"My take...  Why is the castle in the form of DH2???  Bagshot (& Hermione by extension) never stated when the Anti-Apparition Charm was applied to the grounds. Reminder to EVERYONE that the Headmaster during this time was probably *Armando Dippet* & that Dumbledore is *Transfigurations* professor. (tho it's not explained why he's in the DADA area when McGonagall utilized a different area (tower, cloister, courtyard, & classroom)...perhaps Transfiguration was previously located there?)  But maybe there is an answer as to why Ministry officials can Apparate like that: permission was probably requested (& approved) beforehand. I am using 2 instances from the books: *OoTP, OWL's chapter: since it was never explained how the Wizarding Examiners (Griselda Marchbanks et al) got to the castle (it only stated that they were led in by Umbridge through the Entrance Hall). Either that or Portkeys or the Express *HBP, Apparition 101: the Charm was lifted for an hour during the lessons  (just saw the one leading the group is surnamed *Travers* probably the father of the Travers of Voldemort's time or the grandfather of the Death Eater one)  Anyone else notices the bronze statue above Tina moved?  Do they visit the French Ministry of Magic? The interior looks like an eclectic mix of the Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées & the Galeries Lafayette  Where does Flamel figure in this",0,0,yooringonghan,5sEaYB4rLFQ,0.11904761904761905,2018-03-19 14:48:51,True,True

In the very beginning of the trailer, you see people apparating onto Hogwarts grounds.

In the fantastic beasts 2 which took place back in the 1927 it says that he is 375. So from 1927 to 1991 passed exactly 64 years. Flamel is immortal but he can't just forget how time works. J.K.

2018-09-16T10:42:42,"Is it just me who is annoyed the way newt scamander holds and leans his head in many of his scenes? I didn't watch him in other roles as I recall, so I don't know if he does the same in other movies too but as if he holds and leans his head towards his shoulder while bending, lowering his head a bit . His head's position annoys me. It really is irritating. He doesn't hold his head straight like everyone else. Just watch his scenes carefully. You will understand what I'm saying.  just watch the scenes in the video below. You will understand.  /watch?v=eh9QbjqbK4E   For most obvious example, just look at the picture of this video just before you click it. That look, that position of the head. In the video it is 0:27,  You don't have to burst your chin to your upper body 0:31 in this scene; this is exaggerated. (0:31 doesn't bother me that much though). It's just when countless of his head moves in the movie happens to be like in 0:27, scenes like 0:31 cut a swathe. Also in the video it is 0:33, when he gives a look while holding a blue beast. Look at his head, just look. It's not straight. 0:43, can't he just look down while holding his head straightly? I mean why doesn't he just bow down his fucking head towards the table in a straight way instead of bowing his head towards his right side? Does it have to be that way throughout the whole movie? 0:51, just why? Why disappear your neck and merge your head with your body and create wrinkles on your face when you have the chance to hold your head straight and do whatever you are told to with that creature while the camera is filming you from your left side angle? 01:08 again, look behind, closely and carefully just look at him. For example, watch the scene from the movie where he tries to catch Kowalski with his wand and gives up just after kowalski hit him with the suitcase outside the bank. He doesn't always slouch but his head moves whilst performing is really annoying.  I like Harry Potter series and this movie but this annoys me so much.",0,0,Kaan,5sEaYB4rLFQ,-0.06089989759344598,2018-09-16 10:42:42,True,True
