However I cannot watch movies where the animal dies.  I can never watch I am Legend again.  Marlee and me, hell forget that. I never even attempted to watch that one. So here you have this movie. Looks like a great movie, especially for dog lovers.  The problem is not only would you be dealing with one dog dying, but essentially a bunch of them dying.  Now it looks like they don't harp on the deaths all that much by making them extremely sad. And of course you got the little added bit of knowing that the dog is not really dying but instead moving from one body to the next.
