Our social culture considers males the dominate figure when it comes to sex and in doing so dismisses the female point of view. We haven’t seen this kind of inquiry since Freud. Not that I agree with Freudian belief, but he unlike so many in his era addressed female sexuality – he got it wrong, but at least he attempted to understand a women’s needs. Females have desires just like men, but they need substance, a back story to go on. There needs to be connection along with the lust factor. The appeal of this movie makes perfect sense. Males are, for the most part purely visual - so a quick porn scene will do the trick. Women, we're far more complex, therefor sexual desires need to fill more than one need.   And men if you feel inferior or slightly jealous, it’s OK and completely normal.

I've watched soap operas for most of my life, and I don't take them a bit seriously, I can go through romance novels just as quickly as I can read the classics, and I can still claim an IQ of well above 145.  The books weren't porn, if you want to read that, go pick up Wifey by Judy Blume, or something by Erica Jong. Those were around in the 70's and far more explicit, and no one blinked an eye. The movie will not be porn because the books weren't.  There was nothing even close to rape in the books, so I don't know where that's coming from. The books aren't about her signing a contract and becoming a submissive to him...they are about her NOT doing it...and changing HIM. Therefore, this is a love story, not a BDSM story.  So, while all of you who think you are too intelligent to go watch this are enjoying the next Superman, Spiderman, Ironman, or whatever mindless movie full of explosions is playing at the theater next door, I will be enjoying MY guilty pleasure, too.

2014-11-15T21:42:20,"Too many women read 50 Shades Of Grey and don’t understand that this is ABSOLUTELY NOT how BDSM works. Christian is abusive, predatory and emotionally manipulative, and he flat out rapes Ana. Regardless if she signed a contract or not, no means no. And that makes Christen a rapist. In reality, a dom would never, ever ignore limits like that. A dom wouldn’t ignore safe words, boundaries, or fears, because a sub/dom relationship should be based out of mutual respect and trust. The sheer number of women who want a relationship like the one between Christen and Anastasia terrifies me. Christen is NOT a dom, but rather someone who gets off on abusing women and disguises it under the pretense of kinkiness.  These books are NOT an insight into BDSM. It is not erotica. It is a perfect example of an abusive relationship that, in reality, most women would be lucky to get out of alive. If you enjoy the books, that’s completely fine, and you’re perfectly entitled to that. But please, don’t ignore the fact that this is not what BDSM should be like, this is not what sex should be like, this is not romance, and this certainly is not an okay way for ANYONE to treat you without your FULL CONSENT. If someone in your life treats you in any way that makes you uncomfortable, scared, or unhappy, please break off that relationship or else seek help. Abusive relationships are very real, and incredibly easy to get trapped in. Please don’t think that this is an acceptable example of a healthy relationship. ",75,9,Claire Johnson,Fns7oJeQmZ8,0.1986231884057971,2014-11-15 21:42:20,True,True

She loves him. (Not at first but later on) She stands up to him, the whole contract concept is new to her. That's what he likes. She's different.  3. Since when does ""love"" have a direct target? Why do some of you think Christian could do so much better? Because he's rich? He's not perfect he has problems like everyone else. Even the amount of money causes problems.

I'm seeing alot of people's comments and honestly, I totally get what they're saying about how graphic and how they don't like the sexual aspect of the book but when I saw the first trailer I had some mixed feelings about it. Not because I didn't like it, it was just surprising to me that all this stuff that's going on in the trailer was going to be in the movie theater. I'm not gonna lie & say that this movie is freaky as hell. Keep in mind I never read the book but from what I see, the character Christian Grey is A guy who is seriously addicted to sex in a dominant way. And the female character is just a normal girl who mess around and get addicted to. XD anyways it does kinda look interesting lol. But for anybody who goes and see it, If I were you, I would go see it by myself lol. Just because of whoever you see the movie with, you don't wanna make it seem like you're seriously weird. But I'll have to see until it's on DVD because I'm only 16, such a bummer.. I'm surprised  that it's only rated R though. Looks like it should be more than that.

This is the authors imagination, or how she thinks things are in a bdsm relationship or she just wrote a sexual version of twilight without the vamps.  Some people may like Christian Grey's character, some may not. It's all based on preference. You boys out there taking the piss out of Christian's character is amusing. Bc honestly it's almost as if you're jealous. I neither like or dislike this book. So I'm not taking sides. I see some douche calling a girl a whale? Forget about the other words you said. The fact that you'd call a girl a whale is disgusting. Then you go wonder why some girls would fascinate about Christian. Hilarious.  You boys need a life.  Now some of you girls may hate this or love this. It's all up to you.  I'm not gonna judge your preference. But if you dislike the trailer or book, click on the dislike button then. What's the point of all this arguing? It's stupid.        Personally I think Christian's character is somewhat amazing, but then there's the down sides. You all may say that Christian is represented as the ""perfect guy"" but in reality he's not. He's got a lot of problems too. But I guess you need to dig deep to see that.

Yes make more movies, talk about it more on every freaking talk show and just create its 'awareness' which will lead to 'acceptance'. (Psychology 101: you keep repeating it, they will start to like it - top 40 music charts...rings any bell?) Good plan for western evolution of society - purely male focused but they have successfully tricked the women into thinking that this is her freedom, her ultimate destiny - to please a man by getting her whipped, by insulting her and treating her worse than an animal. Amazing! My western sisters are so free now. A decade or two ago, having extra marital affair used to be taboo. Now we have coined new term of ""open marriages"" and slowly introduced it as the evolution of marriage in western society and forcing the new generation to accept it as a norm. Next, will be acceptance of having sex with daughters. Perhaps thats not new - we have seen men kidnapping their own daughters, keeping them in sound proof basements and fathering generations from them in Scandanavia and US. This will catch on too. I guess only thing missing is to put on a freedom cloak on it so that they can get western women's buy in. Good job!",0,0,Rameez Sehgal,Fns7oJeQmZ8,0.15795454545454543,2014-12-06 16:18:52,True,True

She talks to him and listens to him. He loses control around her which he comes to love. A bunch of other interesting stuff (not sex) happens.

Big names shied away from this production unwilling to risk reputations on crappy material for very little financial reward, with good reason. A second script writer had to be brought in to try and improve the script, scenes have had to be re -shot because of the 'lack of chemistry' between the 'leads'. Both leads look a good decade older than their literary counterparts, Dornan fails to impress either in or out of his ill fitting suit and he certainly wouldn't turn heads and make people tongue tied by his mere presence. It trailers he looks awkward, ill a  ease and embarrassed. He couldn't whip cream let alone Ana. Johnson is just out of her depth, spectacularly miscast and unable to cope with the part.  It can't fail to be a hit because people will want to see how bad it is and so little was spent on it.

I used to build dungeons for glamour Dominatrix's in the 90's and have so much experience as a switch.. I think it's cool the trilogy introduced BDSM to mainstream so there are more girls that you can play with in society.. Most kinksters wouldn't even go that far but that is the most positive aspect of that trilogy. If they were going to make a movie out of it though..COMON.. that is the worst choice of leading actress/actor that you could have ever picked. SO many perfect people available to at least make the movie watchable. When they were first starting to entertain who would play the parts I was sure they would butcher it... well they sure as hell did. anyone thinking that they picked good people probably reads harlequin romance novels. Ok that's as much as my life as I can spend on a comment box.. second comment I have ever read but someone had to say it how it is. Instead of watching this crap I would rather have over an 18 year old girl that has never  been dominated over to my house and make her cum 10 times and restrain her and do whatever is fun.. I wouldn't even need popcorn or coke for that. Just a bottle of vodka and do forced intoxication and interrogate her duct taped down to a chair.

My only disappointment with FALLEN (the North-American version and not the European one that came after that by some European based writer...(Europe: unoriginal as always just saying) was that no FILM maker has approached Lauren Kate like they did Anne Rice for a screenplay. Anyway, after finishing this literary, spiritual feat of multidimensional spaces and personally relateable characters filled with dynamic events of supernatural nature, I picked up 50 SHADES of GREY (because of the hype, which I never follow and agree with). Was I not disappointed? Grey is just a man and this woman is just a woman, nothing special or divine just sex and sexual (very ordinary). I never finished reading the dull text since then and felt slightly terrible for wasting some Rands on it. Since I cant use it for toilet paper I figure I should just go through with it in spite of it having nothing special to it. It reads like that other book Woman of Leisure or something like that...like really???

The Book is called ""Fifty Shades Of Grey"" not ""Fifty Shades Of Grey: The Complete and Correct Guide for BDSM"" So I don't understand why all the BDSMers are like this is NOT how BDSM is in real life! Im highly disappointed! blah blah. This book was a TWILIGHT fan fic! I'm sure some of yall have read some fan fics. and how poorly written most of em are. This lady was just having fun not thinking much about it. Doubt she did her research on REAL BDSM probably didn't want to cause again it was a freaking FAN FIC! didn't know that it would end up paying off all her bills in the near future. She was writing a fantasy, that maybe she was drawn to. WHO TH KNOWS! She could have wrote that BDSM is when gum drops and rainbows fall from the sky while unicorns galloped about picking up the fallen gum drops, And it would have been just fine Because its a FICTION BOOK!! MEANING NOT REAL!! 2. For the dumb people that think this Fictional book is the complete guide to how you should be in relationships and what not need to take a step back and look at your self and look at the book again. Its a FICTIONAL BOOK!! Don't let a FICTIONAL BOOK tell you how you should live your life! Take whatever you read in the book with a grain of salt! Don't go around thinking your going to find a man exactly like Christian grey and that's how its going to be, cause its not going to happen.

There were some things in the story I didn't agree with and that I did not like. But overall I enjoyed the story for what it was. And if you take out ALL, well MOST of the sex scenes, what you get is regular love story. Christian is a messed up guy, that Anastasia falls for and ends up changing him in the end. almost every girl wants a bit of a bad boy in her life. (maybe not to that extent.lol but ya know)  I like the character development in Christians character and i'm interested to see how that plays out on screen. Shoot me why don't ya.

Have you actually watched porn? Much of it, even the stuff written for women, is poorly acted, and there are no complicated emotional dynamics. ""Fifty Shades"" on the other hand, gives us a taste of the kind of dynamics involved between Christian and Anastasia--and if the trailer is any indication, it's going to be one hell of a ride. And in the end, come on. It's a STORY. And it is clearly a story that is doing what it's supposed to do: make people sit up, take notice and talk about it, for good or ill. ""Fifty Shades"" NEEDS to be shocking in order to shake us out of our centuries-long puritanical prudery. Does this mean I am going to go around talking about my sex life with everyone? No. There's a time and a place, sure.

2015-02-10T22:35:01,"50 shades of Grey is feminist propaganda. It attacks traditional gender roles by taking them to their logical and sexual extremes.  It makes a dominant man and a submissive woman look damaged by taking those dynamics to the extreme (BDSM).  The book says Christian Grey was sexually abused   in his past ( damaged) and  it depicts Anastasia Steele as a weak girl with low self-esteem that is easily manipulated and controlled with the mentality of a domestic abuse victim.  She leaves Christian but returns to him saying:   "" the physical pain you inflicted on me was nothing compared to the pain of being without you ""  She would rather have negative attention than none at all.  The movie is meant to make it seem that a man with dominant characteristics is damaged and same with a woman who has submissive tendencies. They instill this by taking the dynamics to sexual extremes. It makes it appear as if a dominant  man is damaged, even though the vast majority of dominant men do not have  a desire to tie a woman up  and beat her with a whip.   That is dominance to the extreme. It is intended to be used as propaganda to attack the dominant male gender role and to make women who accept traditional gender roles   look like weak damaged abuse victim.  Christian Grey, stalks, rapes , isolates and humiliates Anastasia Steele. He forces himself on her. She says ""no"" and tries to kick him off. He tells her "" I'll just tie your feet and gag you""  This is how women will think of dominant men now. The books were written at an eight grade reading level specifically so the book could be read by the younger generations.   Most women who see the movie will want to be the opposite of Anastasia Steele. It will lead to increased support of feminism. Young men also think this is how women want to be treated and will develop an unhealthy approach to relationships.  Men are told by society not to objectify women yet at the same time we're  being told that women want to be abused and dominated with physical violence. It will only lead to social friction between men and the average modern day quasi-feminist girl.  Girls will come to hate Christian Grey and associate his dominant characteristics with that of all men. Even though most men have no desire to take the dominant tendencies to the extreme.  The movie makes all dominant men seem like a damaged monster like Christian Grey. That's how women will begin to view men.",0,0,Sam Fisher,Fns7oJeQmZ8,-0.004340277777777777,2015-02-10 22:35:01,False,True

I actually found myself laughing while reading. I know this movie and books have been stirring up controversy about healthy relationships, and the BDSM community. About the relationship, people need to remember it's all fictional. Just like any relationship in romantic novels, it's fictional. Doesn't matter if it's an erotic novel or a teen romance novel or whatever romance novel, it's fictional. A fantasy to enjoy, even if others think the fantasy is crap. To each their own. But if people are looking for their own Christian Grey, they need to be pulled back down to earth cuz reality is totally different. Now if people want to experiment with BDSM, I suggest that they actually do their proper research about BDSM (consent, limits, etc.) instead of relying on ideas coming from a fictional book. That way, people are not being hurt nor killed.  With all that said, I'm actually excited to see the movie.

2015-02-15T01:21:59,"I personally loved the books. Yes, Christian did overstep boundaries most people wouldn't but mainly he did it to protect Ana. He ended up falling in love with her and she ended up falling in love with him. He was emotionally damaged and even I thought that he didn't have excuses for some stuff he did but in the end they were extremely happy. As people say before about there being little to none BDSM I would agree. Mainly he is controlling everything. Christian does give her a contract and tells her to research about it to be sure and so he tries to get her to understand and it Ana's fault for stopping and also she doesn't end up signing it. Ana does tell him to stop multiple times and he does and he worries for her after. I hate that everyone pays extreme attention to the aspects of their relationship that would be seen as abusive if they don't read the books to understand that to each con there is a pro. I liked the plot twists and I found it interesting. I look forward to watching this in theatres. And lastly, I think that the characters look perfect for the roles (except Kate). ",0,0,Sam Perry,Fns7oJeQmZ8,0.23604166666666665,2015-02-15 01:21:59,False,True
