Looks like David Lowery is certainly someone to keep an eye on as this film looks visually stunning. It's no wonder that they are entrusting him with Disney's future ""Peter Pan"" live-action adaptation. I'm liking the small nods to the original with the phrase ""I Saw A Dragon"" at the end, and the capture of Elliot. I could almost see this as more of a sequel to ""Pete's Dragon"" seeing as it takes place in a modern Pacific Northwest forest as opposed to the coastal town of Passamaquoddy, Maine in the early 19th century. Lest we forget, at the end of the original film Elliot left to help another kid in trouble. I hope the film includes nods to the songs that won't be included, or that ""Candle On The Water"" at least be played during the end credits.

TOO. MUCH. NOT CARING ABOUT IMPORTANT THINGS.  I swear Walt Disney is turning in his grave over new Disney movies. if you look back at his old movies, they are SOOOOOO different from newer ones. take Cinderella for instance. a girl who's misunderstood by her family gets what she's always wished for at a price. it's a story we've seen a million times, even back when it was made, but it works! why? because Walt Disney didn't focus too much on making the movie so appealing to certain audiences or about remaking things. he cared about showing only the people who had an actual reason to be there. the things we saw in those older movies, in a characteristic perspective, were things that no one had ever seen before, and were interesting, magical, and important. think of any old movie made by Disney himself. now think of characters in that movie who didn't have a reason to be there. mind blown. If new Disney wants to make a movie, and I mean the first fantastic one they've made in a long time, they need to go in the opposite direction of where they're going now. DO NOT focus on bring old characters into the 21st century. sure it looks and feels cool but it doesn't last. it's like making a new candy, and then making a smoothie version. it lasts way longer, and you can enjoy it long term instead of just eating it, and being done. no one above the age of sixteen cares about old being rethought. absolutely no one.",0,0,Julian Jazzar,fPOamb6d_20,0.15784843779408997,2016-06-15 06:21:56,True,True

Awe! He couldn't POSSIBLY have survived out in the wilderness on his own(Plothole btw)! Wait, what's that? He was raised by a DRAGON!?  And from there the sequence of events that unfold in these movies: Somebody either thinks it's too dangerous OR wants to utilize it as weapon, they enter a conflict stage where the human people try to get the ""bad guys"" off it's back, showdown stage where they almost capture it, but the dragon escapes thanks to the boy's miraculous control over the dragon.

First off, the film was truly scary, since the stakes were literally as high as they could be for both Pete and Elliott. Pete was being pursued by a crazy inbred family that wanted to go back to beating and torturing him as a slave, and Elliott was being hunted by a scary film-flam artist that wanted to kill him and use all his body parts for tonics and potions! As for the music, every song is a classic, or at the very least well constructed, and I remember them as well as any other Disney classic.

I'm not saying that these weren't/aren't going to be good films I personally quite liked the new jungle book.  Its the fact that they have the exact same title now if I want to watch the original bfg film I have to remember the year it was released and then it's still flooded with the new one it's just a little bit of a hassle.

This film is truly representation of family entertainment and it just has that 90s vibe to it being simple, short and modest, but also having a huge heart and great dragon as protagonist. Filmmakers did a fine job in giving this dragon life, personality and his character just shines in this film and you can't help but to fall in love with him. Young Pete was also charming young actor and supporitng cast does a nice job, it is very clean, some will say ecological film with great visuals, cinematography and score.

The dragon goes looking for him and is super sad, and the boy trusts this awful family to take him to see the dragon the next day. And as soon as the dragon comes out to greet them all in the woods he is SHOT repeatedly with drugs and chained up and captured and treated HORRIBLY. And the man responsible for this NEVER gets his comeuppance. The dragon when finally escapes is almost captured again and he is told by the boy NOT to hurt them! Why not? And the worst part is after all this the boy decides to abandon the dragon and live with this disgusting family!!! I hated it!

Why in the world would an innocent little child who is afraid of a ""boogeyman"" in the closet admire a dragon? Yet they are brainwashed to, in order to desensitize and condition kids to be okay with a ""beast system"" (as the bible calls the world system of the end times) and the devil. First it was the fairy tales that copied the details of the bible by having a princess representing the ""bride of Christ"", an unnamed prince representing Jesus Christ the "" Prince of Peace"" who is prophesied to slay the monster called ""Leviathan"" and throw the devil into the ""Lake of Fire"", and also of course by having a dragon which represents the devil....Now they are going full mind control by pushing the ""dragons are good"" agenda, Satanism at its finest. Satan always want to copy God and turn things upside down. Wake up people, you are supporting a ""beast system"". Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Yes He is real, He is more real than you.
