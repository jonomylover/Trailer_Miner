You would do well to get yourself a copy of DVD set 'Does God Exists?' available from Focus on the Family, narrated by Dr Stephen Meyer. Regarding your question, Hebrews 9:27 says  'it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment'. At the Judgment, you will meet Jesus face to face. Acts 10:42 tells us Jesus is the judge. You can't enter his presence unless you are holy. If you've accepted his death on your behalf and he lives in you, you can be with him forever. If you're ambivalent or have said 'no thanks', you will still carry your sin, so you will not be holy and will therefore be banished. However, having seen him in His glory, you will want to be with him forever but it's too late. I believe the 'weeping and gnashing of teeth' is a painful, remorseful gnawing of regret. Those who know him can't wait for him to return. In John 3, there is an account of Jesus teaching Nicodemus about the kingdom of God. He says ' you can't even see it unless you are born again'. Because you are not yet born again, it's reality eludes you, but rest assured, the Kingdom is here.  In Revelation 3:20, Jesus says """"Look! I stand at the door and knock. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in, and we will share a meal together as friends."" He's waiting for you.
