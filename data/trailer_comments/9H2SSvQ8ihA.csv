2018-10-10T16:42:18,"The movie was mixed to me. The basketball scenes were good (I'm a bball fan). The acting and dialogue were not very good overall, making for more cringeworthy comedic scenes than actual funny scenes. All the characters were over-the-top. Kyrie did ok as Drew, his schick was bearable. Reggie Miller and Chris Webber tried their best, Nate's character didnt talk much so he was okay. Lisa Leslie was awful, really couldnt bring over the angry wife character at all. The worse actor was Shaq. He was Terrible. Just too over the top and could not convey the emotions of Big Fella at all. I tried to laugh at him but he was just too weird. Lil Rel did well, as did Nick Kroll. Tiffany Hadish was annoying and a bit too over-the-top. The other lady was just shameless eye candy. The trailer gave away ALL the funny scenes as well. At least the basketball scenes were decent enough",0,0,TAJY26,9H2SSvQ8ihA,-0.028536693191865584,2018-10-10 16:42:18,False,False

And Dax who is played by Lil Rel Howery who was in Get Out tells Uncle Drew that he has seen the movie.
