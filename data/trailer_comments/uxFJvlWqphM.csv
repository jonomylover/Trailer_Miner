In the book, at 16 each child is given his/her occupation according to their interests and abilities. Everyone is shocked to see Jonas given the occupation of The Giver, and from then on he is treated as strange, as he has to receive The Giver's memories so he can become the next one. It's much more complex and intelligent than him just being stupid and adventurous and just *happening* to *randomly* (oh come on), find The Giver in the middle of nowhere, but I guess that's why they changed it. Considering how popular the intelligent and complex TV shows like Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and Game of Thrones are, you'd think they'd take the hint and not dumb everything down so much.

Almost like India or Mexico (that's the way I perceived it, it's been a long time since I've read the book, sorry) So to see this futuristic, Hunger Games like society, is totally jarring.
