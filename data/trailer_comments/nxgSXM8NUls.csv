2018-07-26T09:21:12,"OH BOI HERE COMES A RANT.  lemme explain for those who don't see how this movie will be awful, the fact of the matter is Slender Man hasn't been popular for years and won't be again because of this movie. It appears they're mostly going to make cheap references to the mythos and only dabble in what made the creature scary.   For those who believe he wasn't scary at all, cool, horror is subjective and is different from person to person but for many including myself the reason Slender Man was scary was the fact you did not know what he planned to do with you. You didn't know how he interacted with the world around him, you didn't know what he was doing or why. You didn't know, thats why he was scary!   He was a literal blank slate, a character to be filled, many media involving him (mostly webseries) took the concept and added their own spin. Marble Hornets named him the Operator and he manipulated people to spread his sickness to others. (I know to some this sounds generic, but it was the first coming out in 2009 right when he was created) another series TribeTwelve made his victims into vessels for other beings who work with him, toying with them as he did and was also named the Administrator. In everymanHYBRID the creature has control over the lives of 4 people who he constantly reincarnates only to mess with again.   My point is, this film chose to be so generic with the character and I believe this is the biggest issue, i would much rather see a film that chose to make their own version of the slender man while not straying too far from the original.",11,2,Paradox Gaming,nxgSXM8NUls,0.09433497536945813,2018-07-26 09:21:12,True,True

Ok I'm all up 4 new ideas for creatures to infect and cause insanity but when you have this character and have all the info at disposal and still don't use it is rather more frightening than this. 3, who the hell goes out to the woods for their friend at NIGHT I add. Yeah real smart all you'll find is, well someone already made the joke of this, a corpse, to that person I give credit. 4...i know being picky but last time I checked you find pages and then hear what sounds like distant fireworks from Disneyland. Basically loud drum boom sounds. Not bells. 5, you don't look at him if you do you get taken. 6 why jumpscares this character creature is more than jump scares. But no let's be lazy and do this. Ya know after this honestly I'm up for Hollywood movies to try and make something new and go different routes with things like with the deadpool movie didn't follow much comic wise just did it's own thing. But when it comes to this, and going about it first time with literally all info and don't really use much. feels rather lazy and little if not insulting to the character. Seeing how I still plan to see this to see how it might turn out my Hope's are low and I mean low. And if it is worse than it looks than I pray it will end this cause this is creepypasta and they managed to mess up from trailer point of view. Now if wish to argue please do cause I'm open to hear thoughts, perspective, and more knowledge to original source of slenderman and more abilities, from those who actually took time and effort to learn more of this and other creepypasta characters.",0,0,TheAbysmalGeek,nxgSXM8NUls,0.11861717827626919,2018-07-26 11:10:57,True,True

Besides, this is the perfect/appropriate time to make this movie considering his...past influences. My skepticism comes from whether this is a retread of classic horror movie mistakes such as uninteresting characters, giving the villain an absurd backstory it doesn't need, and setting up something bigger.

The start where they're going through their friends computer and find the 'Slenderman Mythos' stuff is perfect.  The idea that they summon him to try and find their friend, instead of stupid college kids trying to be edgy'TM, is a good idea.  Where I think the movie will falter is that they'll make it so obvious that it's Slender, and lose the reason why the game, and other versions of him like The Operator from Marble Hornets, scary is the suspense.  Instead of having them obviously fighting a monster it should be a paranoi inducing film.  Slow builds and logical, more likely, answers to what happened.  The only times that 'The Slender Man' should appear is when they think that they're being chased and stalked.  The Slenderman game with the 8 pages worked because it was tense, you knew you were being stalked, but you didn't know where it was.  Replacing horror building suspense for tryharding jumpscares will not work, and I think that's what the movie is going to be like.

You know it would have been better as an R rated movie with a detective looking for missing children, a town completely surrounded by woods, and children would go missing with barely a trace but a small note or sketch of Slenderman. Toensfolk and destrot parents describing a tall figure who would be in the distance, a man in a suit. The detective seeing what appears to be a figure in the woods with that description and what looks like a child holding his hand, only to see it was a tree with a doll and a note. In the end slender torments him through what appears to be an endless night as he is chased and attacked by him, trying to fight back but ending up snapping back to reality and seeing that the children were killed, surrounded by their bodies as the last thing we see and hear is slenders face and what sounds like a static scream as he attacks the victim, even if he lives, slender had broken him, he had made him see him until he goes crazy as the final scene is another victim to slender. Instead we get this cast that looks fresh off a Nickelodeon show trying to find their friend by going into the dark woods with nothing, after looking at what Slenderman was! Could have been better with the crappy characters if the movie had slender really fuck with their heads, thoughts of their friend dead, the forest seeming endless with no escape, something actually entertaining.

My closet was turned into a giant theory center, how to fend him off, how to stop him, what to do if he catches you. I saw things, hallucinations because of all the stress i went though. This shit went on until 4th grade. By then i had enough stuff about the long boi here that i could make a book. That was until i saw that one news report. About the 2 girls that stabbed their friend for him. I was shocked and terrified, but the one thing that iffed me.  *he wasnt real* I went insane, everything i studied, the hours i wasted, the YEARS. All for nothing. And so i burned all my work in a large bonfire. I was sad, but i became relieved. I was also then told what a creepypasta was. I ridiculed myself because slenderman was just an internet bogeyman. But now, im just gonna see this movie, as a reminder of all the time i spent thinking about him, almost makes me nostalgic.

The fact that this movie  being released _now_ is a little dumb, but I don't know, I've always been interested in the different interpretations of Slenderman, so I am tiny bit curious about this movie.

2018-08-18T07:55:32,"People, why complain about this being a horrible film. This is actually pretty good for what it is. Yes, it's created by Sony and it's six years late. Booo hooo! Who the f*ck cares about that. We knew this movie was coming, yet you still complain about it being late anyway. Yes Sony created it and filmed it, but honestly this movie wasn't as bad as Goosebumps or The Conjuring, they were terrible, like lullaby stories you read to your children (not that you would). Slender Man is actually good for what it is. Have a bit of salt on it and realize this. SlenderMan is a ""fictional"" supernatural character, who is a thin, tall Man wearing a suit and has no face, and even has long tentacles. SlenderMan traumatizes, terrorizes and kidnaps his victims, favouring small children but goes for teenagers in this movie as well. He's like an illusion and able to make his victims, once they've looked  at his face, do terrible things. He can torment that, make them see things, give them suicidal thoughts. The more they fear him, the more he is able to control their minds until they commit suicide or get captured. This is exactly what the movie showed here. Ya'll are so hypocritical internet absorbed about how ""bad"" it is, it's ridiculous.

It would appear to me, that most of perhaps all of the people saying it is bad or trash have played the Slender man game. Thus expecting the movie to follow the game. However let me interject by asking. When has any movie based off of a video game, been good compared to the game and it's plot? So far as I am aware... never. Thus I believe it's best to realize that these films are ""based"" and quite loosely at that. Off of the original material. I haven't seen the film yet.

There was supposed to be this one scene where they were dissecting an eye and one of the girls used a scalpel and stabbed herself in the eye I think. But they didn’t show that scene. It wasn’t that scary either. If I had to rate it I would rate it a 4/5.,6,0,PengweneO Roblox &More,nxgSXM8NUls,-0.09375,2018-08-25 18:30:49,False,True
