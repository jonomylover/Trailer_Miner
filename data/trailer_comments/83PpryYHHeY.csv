Hauck from The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, is: ""That which is Below corresponds to that which is Above, and that which is Above corresponds to that which is Below, to accomplish the miracle of the One Thing.""[32] Thus, whatever happens on any level of reality (physical, emotional, or mental) also happens on every other level.  This principle, however, is more often used in the sense of the microcosm and the macrocosm. The microcosm is oneself, and the macrocosm is the universe. The macrocosm is as the microcosm and vice versa; within each lies the other, and through understanding one (usually the microcosm) a man may understand the other.[33]  As Above, So Below is from Hermes Trismegistus.  Movie looks dumb.",0,0,Nie tr™,83PpryYHHeY,0.0019230769230769247,2014-04-24 19:56:29,True,True

If you're going to sit there and slag off every horror film that comes out just because it doesn't match up to the likes of The Evil Dead or The Exorcist, then you're going to waste a lot of your own time.

Just because this may not be viewed as a great and iconic horror film in 30 years time, doesn't mean you have to go all keyboard-warrior on it.  Let's also not forget that people have been making horror films for almost 100 years now; if you're still going to demand something completely original and never-seen-before after 100 years of horror films, then you're clearly never going to be satisfied. Besides, this looks like it has a lot of potential and I'll definitely go and see it.",0,0,Lewalon VS,83PpryYHHeY,0.03410714285714288,2014-08-13 22:17:54,True,True

A man is known to have gone missing down there and he was never found again.

I also really liked the setting and plot because everything now is about possessed little girls or a demonic houses everything is so CLICHED! and unoriginal i felt this movie was very ORIGINAL! I didn't even know what Catacombs were until i saw this movie! SO screw the critics on this one! and go watch it, it's definitely worth watching once! It'll make a good rental.

It also had a lot of pagan symbolism which I quite enjoyed. The ending made me think and instead of the whole movie being ""found footage"", I think it was made like that to see the characters point of view to make it feel more real *spoiler alert* I have a theory that the main character is in hell the whole time. Hell is repetition where your past would haunt you and you see apparitions of her dead dad in the very beginning. Before the voyage into the catacombs you meet entities you see later on as the demons lik the boy from the burning car who tels her to go see paps and the demon girl from the singing cult freaks. I think she might've been dead the whole time and believes that her life still continued and she follows her dads legacy to find the philosophers stone aka the only way to bring herself back from the dead. The philosophers stone in this story might be an actual thing in hell and those who are fortunate and smart enough to find it can ressurect themselves back into this world. Knowledge is power is also a theme in this movie. I suggest those who are interested in the other messages to rewatch the movie and let your imagination run.

I liked the cast, their acting was fine and they were not standard horror assholes, although i did not care for them because they were expendable. Production values are good - they filmed it in a real catacombs after all - you almost feel like you're with them and I also give the movie points for having clever twist in the end.

Once they go farther into the cave, the stone no longer works for some reason and the girl runs alllll the way back past their dormant murderous hallucinations, climbed 50 ft back up the cave and remembers exactly where she took the magic stone to put it back. Oh, and I guess the producers forget that where she got the stone, the cave collapsed but was normal when she went back...

2018-10-25T05:05:32,"This movie could of have had great potential to lure more people into watching it, but the acting was mediocre and the story was poorly written as it became too predictable in most of the scenes.  I have given it a thumbs up though because it re-introduces many forbidden and forgotten subjects in today's time.  While some people will see this movie as a movie belonging to a genre of either a horror or adventure movie, or both, I see it as an excellent tool to tell people and show people a little bit of the past.  For example, the movie goes into Iran, where it is known that there are known networks of caves (as well as many other places in the Middle East) where at one point in time served as underground corridors for elites and the privileged religious sects to move around or hide.  The movie also goes back in time to mention and discuss perhaps 15,000 year-old Egyptian history and architecture.  It brought viewers into scenes of the Paris Catacombs in a bizarre and twisted perspective, and interestingly tied it together with modern-day myth and folklore.  But for me personally, what drew me in to the film was the introduction of Alchemy, how alchemy sort of developed in Europe, and the mention of the mythical Philosopher's Stone.  Again, these are subjects that have been forgotten by most societies, but despite some of the subjects not being around today, there is ample evidence left behind for us to study and research.  I would recommend the film so that those people who follow history can see and get another perspective idea of many of the subjects mentioned on the film.",0,0,Manuel Villalpando,83PpryYHHeY,0.12451923076923078,2018-10-25 05:05:32,False,False
