I initially watched the trailer without any context to the film and I was so damn lost to what this was all about. I thought she (Alice) was just a thirsty cougar sleeping with a random boy band kid who was barely 21. (turns out in the movie, he was actually meant to be 27). BUT THIS MOVIE IS HONESTLY SOOOO MUCH MORE!! I urge anyone to pleeaaasee give it a watch. Their relationship isn‚Äôt the only thing that happens; there is something so special about the theme of family in this movie! The acting, in my opinion, is so phenomenal! I love how their characters were portrayed so well. Alice and Harry‚Äôs relationship isn‚Äôt just about sex, there‚Äôs so much more to their chemistry that you‚Äôll notice throughout the movie. It isn‚Äôt too cheesy; in fact, I was always shocked to see how their relationship turned out in the end. It is NOT a realistic film; it isn‚Äôt meant to be. It‚Äôs something about hope, and trusting the plans of fate and just finding ‚Äúhome again‚Äù (pun intended).
