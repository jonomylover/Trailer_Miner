Who knows what personal sacrifices he had to make to get his big break and now can do exactly what he wants with his own stories instead of cashing in. He had the script for this in 2010, but couldn't make it happen, since he didn't have a fan base and he would only make it with heavy alterations by the studios. It was shot and finished in 2015. Five years. That's how long it took for the couple to start out and become successful in their dreams.
