He would force the Lost Boys to play game in which he would murder them, and to him their lives meant nothing. Hook was, interestingly enough, a much more moral character. Yes he as a pirate, and yes and was trying to kill Peter. However, he was very conflicted over the idea of killing a child, and was only going to due it because, against for his amusement, Peter and the Lost Boys would randomly attack and kill his crew. As for the Indians, he was their ally only because at that time he was having more fun fighting pirates. He would also attack the Indians sometimes. In fact, I read that originally, Hook was not even going to be in the story. It Peter himself was going to be the bad guy. The story was not about the magic of childhood. It was about how vicious children can be to each other, and why adults must watch out for children. Anyway, this kind of ruined Peter Pan for me.

When I first heard about this I was like ""Oh come on they're doing another Peter Pan movie after that live one in 2004, even the Disney cartoon was still better, despite the racists part with the Native American's look and song"" What I didn't know is that this is a origin story, a concept similar to Steven Speilberg's classic adaption to make an original sequel, ""Hook"" where Peter Pan has grown up and forgotten himself but here we witness his beginning. Though this concept gets pretty old, two friends meet and eventually become enemies as seen here that Hook is a ally. I'm not sure if it's good or bad, I don't know. For example: live fairy tale films such as Disney's Wonderland: too much Tim Burton weirdness & terrible visuals. Oz :good visuals & story, but needed better actors. Maleficent: too centered on making the good ones bad, but pretty good dark look & Jolene pulls it off well. I'm already assuming Cinderella next year will have mixed results too anyway. I might just see it at home or see it with my sister since she has the entire collection of peter pan movies, like ""Finding Neverland"".

The book series Peter and Starcatchers (which is amazing) has been out forever and it has it's own award-winning Broadway play completely dedicated to the beginnings of Peter Pan.

I understand you're an accomplished actor and I respect you for that--but I /don't/ respect you for taking a role that you had to understand was a whitewash. (And speaking of that, the Mollusk tribe in the book is treated with a beautiful kind of respect and uniqueness--not this ridiculous over-done playing-on-stereotypes portrayal of what feels like the 1800 perspective of what ""native tribe"" means.)¬† I could be wrong. This is, after all, only the teaser trailer. Maybe this movie will redeem the fuck out of itself leave us all weeping politically correct tears.

Second, what the fuck is up with the tribe's costumes? They look like something out of a Katy Perry music video. If you're going to do Natives, then fucking do them right! Warner Brothers, I really wish, like the 2003 version of Peter Pan, you also had the decency to cast an actual Native American woman as Tiger Lily. America needs to stop with this white washing bullshit when it comes to people of Native American descent.

2014-12-30T03:15:41,"1. In the original Peter Pan books, Tiger Lily is canonically Native American. She, and her tribe are described as ""redskins"", which translates to American Indian for all of those who use the excuse ""Neverland isn't Native American"". 2. Rooney Mara was not chosen ""simply out of talent"". Native American women did audition but were explicitly told that the producers were not looking for Native Americans to play Tiger Lily. They were looking for a white actress. All Native Americans that sought to audition were turned away without being given a chance. 3. If you're going to argue with the backlash Disney's 1953 Peter Pan received due to their awful portrayal of Native American's, let me point you towards Universal Pictures' 2003 Peter Pan which used an actress from an Indian Tribe as their Tiger Lily. They didn't receive the backlash you're using as an excuse. 4. For those arguing about the casting of Annie as a black girl, I have a few things; First of all, you're disregarding the fact a Native American was whitewashed with the argument that there's a black girl playing a white character. Hypocritical, much? Secondly, when Annie was first created, her red hair made her appear more vulnerable as a character due to the prejudice against the Irish at the time. Bearing in mind this was in the early 20th century, and I can see why they would use that same vulnerability in the form of a black girl due to the evident prejudice now going on towards blacks in today's society. Thirdly, Annie was first released when over 90% of the population was white. Nowadays, over 50% of orphans in New York are African American, so it makes a lot of sense. 5. The reason people are so angered over this is because there is next to no poc [people of colour] representation in the media. Whenever we get the chance to see a character that isn't white in media, they get replaced by a white actor. This is also why some people aren't as angered over the Annie casting, because it's nice to actually see a black person in media for once (and please don't try saying something stupid along the lines of ""we see Will Smith in movies all the time"" because he's one of the very few poc in media and by using him as your defense you just sound silly). No matter which poc in movies you try to use as your defense, it's still a fact that more than 80% of main roles in media are given to white people. Yeah, you know that anger you're feeling over Annie being portrayed as a black person? Imagine if that happened almost every single time a white person was given the chance to have a main role in media. Now you might get a glimpse of what it's like for poc. 6. To the person who called out someone for being a racist and then proceeded to use the n-word, you're a disgusting hypocrite and I hope someone teaches you a lesson one day for using such a vile term.",3,0,lexus,tjW1mKwNUSo,-0.06491774891774893,2014-12-30 03:15:41,True,True
2014-12-30T03:50:16,"First of all, Neverland is a made up island in a completely different world, located at ""the first star to the right and straight on 'till morning"". So, to say that the indians located there are ""Native American"" - meaning native to the Americas, which is no where near Neverland - is completely inaccurate. Indian is just an outdated term that was used to describe the tribes that lived in Neverland, if anything you should be calling them Native Neverlandians. The two cultures of Native Americans and Native Neverlandians have nothing to do with each other and should be depicted as such. Now, it seems that that this movie might be attempting to do just that, seeing as the costumes worn show very little similarity to that of traditional Native American wear.  Secondly, if you truly wish to live in a color-blind world, you must accept a person of ANY race playing ANY person they wish to. You must be ok with a black person playing a traditionally white role, a hispanic person playing a traditionally asian role, or anyone of any mixture playing anyone of any mixture.

It seems  that the culture is more from India then Native Americans living in the USA. Since Peter Pan takes place in early 1900s, ordinary British society at the time knew very little about those that lived on US soil. I think its because they were more familiar with asian cultures, and spiritual practices of the east because of British colonization. Tiger Lily and her father may have had ancestors from England that lived in India. They could have decided to practice Indian spirituality. Her father is white and looks like a guru. I'm guessing the movie makers may have thought that calling Native Americans, Indians would be politically incorrect.

But something EVERYONE should realize is we are all humans. we are all the same species and we should see each other the same. we should have equal opportunity for all races. everyone should have a chance to become what ever they set their heart to and telling someone they can't play a part because their skin color doesn't work for you is wrong. on another note the story was written by J. M. Barrie over 100 years ago. you want the original? read the book. but understand that everyone is different and over the decades, the original story was retold countless times through many plays and movies. it will never be exactly the same as the original because those retellings are inspired versions of the original. why would someone want to tell someone else's story? they wouldn't be able to say it's their story. by changing a few things they can create something new, fresh and exciting. i don't want every peter pan movie to be the same. why would i want to go see a movie I've already seen? i love the movie Hook because it's creative and thinks outside the original story.",1,0,fulbul,tjW1mKwNUSo,0.11710325659189294,2015-03-08 03:03:33,True,True

2015-06-06T05:55:43,Rooney Mara as Tiger Lily... no. Just no. It saddens me when they take the few characters intended for actors of other races than white and have them played by white actors. But the same thing goes for when they cast people of color in book adaptations just because they want to seem considerate. In the end though people need to realize that in a diverse country as the USA we do not have as much of a diverse array of actors of other colors in mainstream films. This just reminds me when cinema placed an all white american cast in the movie The House of Spirits when they were supposed to be of Latin descent in south america. The movie was bashed by critics because of this and rightly so. ,5,0,YG,tjW1mKwNUSo,0.00357142857142857,2015-06-06 05:55:43,True,True
