Heck, you might want to consider yourself LUCKY if you're some rotten-ass kid and *all that happens* to you on Christmas is a facsimile of Satan delivers you kicking and screaming to the black gates of The Inferno.

2015-09-10T21:47:32,"The problem with modern horror movies is that they're mostly made by people who are not intelligent and creative enough to come up with ideas that would really scare people. All they use are cheap lame jump scares. When was the last time you were scared watching a horror movie WITHOUT the scene going something like this:  1) dark room,  2) silence,  3) character walking slowly, camera focused on his face,  4) camera turns into POV mode,  5) a loud sudden sound happens and something jump out, or falls down, etc.   NEVER. It always happens like that. And that is the cheapest, most disgustingly terrible way to make horror films.  Even if a pink fluffy bunny jumped out and some childish cute music started playing loudly, you'd be equally scared for that second, because you weren't scared by the scene, or by what is happening in the movie, you were just startled by the loud sudden noise. And people don't seem to understand that, even worse, they seem to like these stupid jump scares which seem like they were filmed by imbeciles for imbeciles to watch.  For once I'd like to watch a new horror movie that made my skin crawl because of the atmosphere, sound, setting, THE SCRIPT,  and just fully rely on cheap jump scares, in fact, I want a horror movie without a single jump scare. A jump scare in a horror movie is like an explosion in an action movie...sometimes it's best to find different ways to excite the audience.",0,0,BeyerT1,h6cVyoMH4QE,0.035982271696557405,2015-09-10 21:47:32,True,True

They are either over the top nonsense, strange and dumb, or a jump scare a thon like this looks to be. No subtle thrillers like Jaws that's for sure. That was the greatest scary movie of all time. Because it was a brilliant take on the fear of water, the unknown of the ocean, and the fear of creatures lurking in the deep. Nothing jumping out to scare you, no slasher gore fest, and no stupid plot. Just a play on the unknown, that what you can't see. This is another uninteresting cash in on the holiday.

According to traditional narratives around the figure, Krampus punishes children during the Christmas season who have misbehaved, in contrast with Saint Nicholas, who rewards well-behaved ones with gifts. Regions in the Austrian diaspora feature similar figures and, more widely, Krampus is one of a number of Companions of Saint Nicholas in regions of Europe. The origin of the figure is unclear; some folklorists and anthropologists have postulated a pre-Christian origin for the figure.

2015-11-06T21:11:17,"I'll be the one to drop the explanation for the ignorant: in certain parts of Europe they celebrate the Christmas season with the story of Saint Nicholas, rather than Santa Claus, though they are very similar.  Saint Nicholas is, as his name implies, a saint of the Church who goes around during the yule season and rewards good boys and girls with presents.  But in certain regions, they believe that Saint Nicholas has a counterpart named Krampus. He's an ugly monster who punishes bad children by spanking them with birch tree branches and tossing them in a giant sack and carrying them away.  Krampus night is observed in some countries on the night of December 5th with festivals and parades where adults dress in monster costumes and scare the little kiddies.

The promise of this movie, of course, made me research the myth a lot more, and WOW, is it an interesting legend! Once upon a time, Christmas wasn't just a commercialized day of happiness and colors and lights, it /meant/ something. The fact that St. Nicholas was accompanied by a demon who whipped the kids who'd been bad while the saint himself gave gifts to the kids that were good gives the whole ""naughty or nice"" thing SO much more meaning - better than just ""you don't get presents"", it's ""you get punished"".

But there's no need to be afraid of the dark or of our shadow, and they are not a negative or unnatural things.  It's kind of odd how some people feel about darkness.  When talking about certain things, some people equate the dark to being scary, bad, or evil, but I never could understand it.  =/ This is just a philosophical thought, but if darkness has been around ever since the beginning of everything before anything else, is all around us, and there is even inside of us (I imagine it gets pretty dark inside of our bodies.  I don't think we have light bulbs inside of us), and follows us around in the form of our shadow, isn't darkness one of the most natural and non-evil things out there?  =o And night time is actually one of the most peaceful times for most people.  It's when we rewind, recharge, and heal.  Can't people just say what they mean? Could have easily said ""evil"" there, you know. l=/ And I've heard some things about this Krampus.

I'll call it a WINTER BLOCKBUSTER it builds the horror part . even though krampus come to get children and whip them and also eat and shake them to become good. It adds to the horror by it being funny because it shows stuff can turn in the wrong direction. Also i think the reason he's there is because that kid who through out Saint Nicola's letter and also because they fought each other as well. He comes to get bad children and eat them or makes them his helpers. Thats what think this movie will get a lot of people coming to the movies.

A selfless act from the ""survivors"" at the climax will reveal Krampus' true intentions, which are to teach the family to work together and quit being so selfish. Krampus is good for caring about peoples moral compass while Santa will be revealed as the true evil for making people selfish and materialistic in their youth. The family will live on happily and humbly, teaching the audience a lesson in humility and caring for one another.

The movie begins just a few days before Christmas, which is unusual, because Krampusnacht (Krampus Night) is set on the evening of December 5th. And one character stated Krampus is thousands of years old, but my research  said his type of folklore have only been around for a few hundred years, which is very old, but doesn't technically classify him as being ""ancient"".

2016-04-27T01:26:34,Would not recommend this movie if ur looking for horror. This movie is not scary at all. No pop ups and definitely no creepy Scenes and not really any scary LOOKIN creatures/monsters. Although if you are looking for a comedy movie based on a family being terrorized by demons(like haunted house 1 and 2) then this is the right movie for u! Honestly this movie is not scary at all. It made me laugh more than it made me creeped out or scared,0,2,Sick in Sense,h6cVyoMH4QE,0.21190476190476193,2016-04-27 01:26:34,False,False

Towards the end the little boy sacrifices himself to get his family back. Then if you remember the last scene, the boy wakes up, he thought it was all just dream. He sees everyone happy and joyful, he is handed a box and when he opens it there is a bell with written Krampus word on it. Then the movie ends with scene where the family is trapped in snow globe which means that the family got a second chance but from now on the Krampus is watching over them and the bell is a reminder of that.",0,0,Kayla xx,h6cVyoMH4QE,0.04895833333333335,2017-11-15 19:12:10,False,False
