I thought it was going to be your typical teeanage film that tried too hard to be cool and hip, but it really wasn't. It was one of the most raw, emotional, and genuine movies I've seen this year. They portrayed depression so well, from having that lingering sadness inside you although you had the things which made you seem fine. I related to Nadine so much on so many things that it hurt. I cried so many times throughout this movie because it reflected a bit of my own life as well. I cannot begin to comprehend how thankful I am for this film, for how real, sad, and sweet it is. I know a lot of teenagers could benefit greatly from watching this. Watching Nadine become happy in the end and discovering more of herself did thrilling things to my heart.

I‚Äôve been told being a teenager is a beautiful time and I should be happy. Being a teenager sucks so hard, Disney and other studios make it seem glamorous. After having a horrible anxiety attack, I just couldn‚Äôt go to school, and felt horrible and just couldn‚Äôt live with myself. I luckily had a teacher who saw I was struggling and had to stay in the office for the whole school day just because I couldn‚Äôt live with myself being in a classroom with kids not knowing what they were thinking of me being all sad and with red eyes and my mom couldn‚Äôt pick me up. Unlike Nadine, my best friend lives thousands of miles away and I have to be alone. The scene where she told her teacher about wanting to kill herself and overthinks was what I was thinking sitting in the school office so anxious, I wanted to die and felt ashamed of who‚Äôve I become and was hyperventilating. Also the scene where Nadine goes to a party and just stands alone with no one is so relatable since I have to go to school fairs and deal with me being alone. Hollywood needs to rethink what being a teenager was like because it‚Äôs horrible. At the end, where she gets better gave me hope.
