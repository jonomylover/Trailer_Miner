2017-07-16T02:09:28,"In 1970, a mother purchased an antique Raggedy Ann Doll from a hobby store  The doll had been a birthday present for her daughter, Donna. Donna was a  preparing to graduate from college with a nursing degree. She  lived in a tiny apartment with her room mate, Angie. (a nurse as   Pleased with the cute raggedy-Ann doll, Donna placed it on her bed as a decoration and didn't give it a second thought. Within days  both Donna and Angie noticed that there appeared to be something very strange and creepy about the doll. The doll mysteriously seemed to move about the house, relatively small movements at first, such as a change in position, but as time passed the movement became more noticeable. Donna and Angie would come home to find the doll in a completely different room. Sometimes the doll would be found with legs crossed,arms folded, other times it would be found upright, standing on its feet.  Several times Donna sometimes left the doll on the couch before leaving for work, and would return to find the doll back in her room on the bed- with the door closed.  Annabelle the doll not only moved but could write as well.  About a month into their experiences Donna and Angie began to find  messages on parchment paper that read ""Help Us"" and ""Help Lou"". The hand writing as if written by a small child. The creepy part about the messages was not the wording but the way they were written. At the time Donna had never kept parchment paper, on which the notes were written, in the house, so where did it come from?   One night Donna came home to find the doll had moved again, this time it was on her bed. Donna had come to find that this was typical of the doll but some how she knew this time it was different, something wasn't right. A sense of fear came over her when she inspected the doll and saw what looked like blood drops on the back of its hands and its chest. Seemingly, from no where, a liquidy red substance had appeared on the doll. Scared and desperate Donna and Angie decide it was time to seek expert advice.   Not knowing where to turn they contacted a medium and a seance was held. Donna was then introduced to the spirit of Annabelle Higgins. The medium related the story of Annabelle to both Donna and Angie. Annabelle was a young girl that resided on the property before the apartments were built, they were ""happy times"". She was a young girl of only seven years old when her lifeless body was found in the field upon which the apartment complex now stands.   The spirit related to the medium that she felt comfort with Donna and Angie and wanted to stay with them and be loved. Feeling compassion for Annabell and her story Donna gave her permission to inhibit the doll and stay with them. They were to soon find out however, that Annabelle was not what she  appeared to be. This was no ordinary case and definitely no ordinary doll.  Lou was friends with Donna and Angie and had been with them since the day the doll arrived. Lou had never been fond of the doll and on several occasions warned Donna that it was evil and to get rid it of it. Donna had a compassionate tie to the doll and not giving much credence to Lou's' feelings kept it. Donnas' decision, it turns out, was a terrible mistake.  Lou awoke one night from a deep sleep and in panic. Once again he had a reoccurring bad dream. Only this time somehow, something seemed different. It was as though he was awake but couldn't move. He looked around the room but couldn't discern anything out of the ordinary and then it happened. Looking down toward his feet he saw the doll, Annabelle. It began to slowly glide up his leg, moved over his chest and then stopped. Within seconds the doll was strangling him. Paralyzed and gasping for breath Lou, at the point of asphyxiation, blacked out. Lou awoke the next morning, certain it wasn't a dream, Lou was determined to rid himself of that doll and the spirit that possessed it. Lou, however, would have one more terrifying experience with Annabelle.  Preparing for a road trip the next day Lou and Angie were reading over maps alone in her apartment. The apartment seemed eerily quiet. Suddenly, rustling sounds coming from Donnas room aroused fear that someone had possibly broken into the apartment. Lou determined to figure out who or what it was quietly made his way to the bedroom door. He waited for the noises to stop before entering and turning on the light. The room was empty except for Annabelle whom was tossed on the floor in the corner.   Lou scoured the room for forced entry but nothing was out of place. But as he got close to the doll he got the distinct impression that somebody was behind him. Spinning around he was quick to realize that nobody else was there. Then in flash he found himself grabbing for his chest, doubled over, cut and bleeding. His shirt was stained with blood and upon opening his shirt there on his chest was what looked to be 7 distinct claw marks, three vertically and four horizontally, all were hot like burns. These scratches healed almost immediately, half gone the next day, fully gone by day two.  Paranormal Investigation: The Warrens Donna finally was willing to believe the spirit in the house was not that of a young girl but inhuman and demonic in nature. After Lou's' experiences Donna felt it was time to seek real expert advice and contacted an Episcopal priest named Father Hegan. Father Hegan felt it was a spiritual matter and felt he needed to contact a higher authority in the church, so he contacted Father Cooke who immediately contacted the Warrens.  Ed and Lorraine Warren immediately took interest in the case and contacted Donna concerning the doll. The Warrens, after speaking with Donna, Angie, and Lou came to the immediate conclusion that the doll itself was not in fact possessed but manipulated by an inhuman presence. Spirits do not Possess inanimate objects like houses or toys, they posses people. An inhuman spirit can attach itself to a place or object and this is what occurred in the Annabelle case. This spirit manipulated the doll and created the illusion of it being alive in order to get recognition. Truly, the spirit was not looking to stay attached to the doll, it was looking to posses a human host.   The spirit or in this case an inhuman demonic spirit, was essentially in the infestation stage of the phenomenon. It first began moving the doll around the apartment by means of teleportation to arouse the occupants curiosity in hopes that they would give it recognition.Then predictably the mistake of bringing a medium into the apartment to communicate with it. The inhuman spirit now able to communicate through the medium, preyed on the girls emotional vulnerabilities by pretending to be a rather harmless, lost young girl with which during the seance, was allowed permission from Donna to haunt the apartment. Insofar as demonic is a negative spirit, it then set about causing patently negative phenomena to occur; it aroused fear through the weird movements of that doll, it brought about the materialization of disturbing handwritten notes, the symbolic drops of blood on the doll, and ultimately it even attacked Lou leaving behind the symbolic mark of the beast. The next stage of the infestation phenomenon would have been complete human possession. Had these experiences lasted another 2 or 3 more weeks the spirit would have completely possessed, if not harmed or killed one or all of the occupants in the house.",0,1,Jason Tillman,EjZkJa6Z-SY,-0.0187037037037037,2017-07-16 02:09:28,True,True

The devil tricks them and brings back a fraud Annabelle. They don't know this until she does evil shit, like putting herself into the doll, the mother and father preform a religious ceremony locking the doll into a closet and putting bible pages around the door (glued). The family wants to get back with God so they decide to help out a few orphan girls and a nun. The mother isn't introduced to the girls until later on because level Annabelle broke her legs. (Happens before the ceremony). The girls think the mom is the one haunting the house. The blonde girl (main character and bad leg) and her sister (Dora looking girl) set about the house and find the doll. The doll terrorizes only them two for awhile until one night little sister goes to sleep and the other goes out. Gets thrown off the stair case and gets put in a wheelchair. She tells the nun and she talks about how its impossible while they have the protection of God. The nun takes her outside and let's her get some sun. The nun goes in the house to help the mother of Annabelle (she has a bell that she rings) something pushes the blonde into an old barn nearby. Annabelle possesses her and the nun runs back to her. In which the blonde girl acts normal saying ""I'm fine"" (being possessed and all) the little sister talks about how they found scary stuff to the father. The girl mentions how they found the doll and it moves. The father is aggravated at this and runs inside. All the girls are outside playing and the nun is still in the barn looking for a missing wheel  Janice's (the main bad legged girl) /Annabelle wheelchair. The  father is inside when he sees Francine in the dining hall. He holds up his cross to her and she breaks his fingers making him drop the cross and steals his soul. He's dead. The night after the little girl takes the doll out to the well and drops it in. And the nun is behind her asking what she's doing. She talks about how she's getting rid of it because its messing with her sister. Bad shit happens after that (just pointing out the nun is not old, but actually hot asf) the other girls scream in the house and they run back. The nun runs in the mothers room and asks about the doll, she tells her everything that I said way up at the beginning. How she died and all that other stuff. (BTW the events go Annabelle dies, orphan girls show up, and then the mother tells the nun the story) I kind of mixed that up. But they go through a whole night of hell and the nun manages to lock Janice in a closet. The police show up and can't find Francine. Then it jumps and shows janice  in an orphanage and she gets adopted by the family you see in Annabelle's 1. Fast forward and it shows pictures of Janice/Annabelle growing up. Then it shows the part where she and her boyfriend slit her foster dad's throat then proceed to kill her foster mom.",0,0,Nova Ssk,EjZkJa6Z-SY,-0.07182971014492752,2017-08-26 00:47:53,False,True
