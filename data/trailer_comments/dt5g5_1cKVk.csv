Del Toro's movies were such a labor of love. He was underfunded on both movies and they outperformed even what the studios expected. Yet, they were more inclined to not pay the guy to finish the trilogy like they had originally intended.  I'm just not sold on a new director/movie. They don't have the love or devotion to monsters like he does. I know they want a franchise, but they could of had it before and opted out. Harbour's practical makeup and prosthetics look terrible and out of place against the CG. It just doesn't gel as well as Del Toro's reliance on mostly practical effects and limited CG, making for a more whimsical, yet horrifying product. That's something rarely created in this franchise driven world. It could of set itself apart from the machine made art hitting shelves now.

With people somehow seeing Wonder Woman as a good movie and that mass delusion resulting in a hit, Aquaman seeming like it actually is as good as a kid friendly hero movie can be, as well as Shazam! looking decent in the same sense and now this looking to be at least as good as any of the non-Russo Brothers Marvel crap everyone seemed to enjoy....   DC may actually be able to remove the terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, awful, terrible shit pile that Hack Snyder left behind and have a decent franchise going forward.  Losing Cavill as Superman though... That's a really big blow for this hope. He was the perfect Superman... Squandered by a moron that who ZERO business deciding the overall plot.   I like a lot of his ideas when it comes to various little details, like Batmans voice modulator, the choice of allowing him to be violent in taking out killers... Shit like that. He had a good sense of what would be cool and badass.   And he is a terrific cinematographer.. absolutely outstanding.  But the guy was a moron who didn't get what makes movies good and interesting. He had no clue about what things to focus on. Superman and Batman are about more than action scenes and punching. You gotta hype up every single thing each hero does in a compelling way. Every punch and kick should have emotional weight behind it.  He did next to nothing to hype Superman up. I mean in the sense of him being the greatest blessing to the Earth that it could ever possibly get. A symbol of hope AND an AGENT of hope.There was ONE scene that sorta did this and it was a throwaway montage with no real emotional context  The scene where he saves the poor woman, weeping from overwhelming gratitude when she was sure she and her family were dead... This regular man with power to answer the most desperate of prayers... THAT is how you focus on Superman. Not have him be a stylish action hero. Hack Snyder completely missed the point of Superman.   Hack... Snyder. Sickens me that people who don't get it are the ones who get to write these movies. I could literally write a better movie by the end of the day. Literally. Well, I'd have the treatment done. Detailed dialogue and pacing would take a couple weeks at most. The shit writes itself. It sickens me.

2018-12-19T22:09:47,"If you are willing to sit down and examine the trailer its really not all that bad. Just put YouTube speed on 0.25, mute your volume and it has some really great hidden moments within it. I have listed a few ‚ÄúKey Moments‚Äù for you slackers ;)  but first my thoughts on the trailer‚Ä¶.  Overall I believe the tone of the trailer is playful and comedic. I think that it destroys and distracts from what the film truly is. A dark, gritty, bad ass movie that was made for a mature audience. My guess for the comedic/ ‚Äúlight hearted‚Äù tone that is presented was intentionally done as a marketing strategy.( It‚Äôs failing miserably) They did this in fear that a dark superhero can‚Äôt survive in todays ever growing Marvel and Dc trite. Therefore we are left with the cast and directors telling us its going to be this horror-action film during interviews, then we have Lionsgate come along and promote it as‚Ä¶.well in the ‚ÄúLegendary AF‚Äù movie-thingy-cabob style. That is conflicting with what the film actually is, but with some recent marketing images/ leaked early viewer reviews, I am beginning to see a ‚Äúcourse correction‚Äù. In the end, I will ABSOLUTELY see this movie. Just from a fan‚Äôs perspective I want to see the Hellboy franchise succeed and something tells me that if this movie fails we won‚Äôt be seeing Hellboy on the big screen for at least another decade, maybe longer‚Ä¶‚Ä¶      At 0:14 Excalibur (the sword is still in the stone) I see what they did there   At 1:05 Hellboy possibly picking up The Good Samaritan?   At 1:27 This is definitely a scene that adapts story elements from the comic B.P.R.D Hell On Earth and or Rasputin The Voice Of The Dragon  At 1:28 We get a glimpse at this strange bat like creature. Well, in the comics Hellboy fights a professional wrestler that turns into a vampire. This is again a fantastic adaptation from comic to screen  At 1:39   (This is probably a flashback) You can see Grigori Rasputin performing the ritual to open the portal. He appears to be a direct adaptation from the comic pages to the big screen. Which we all know will lead to the ‚Äúbirth‚Äù of Hellboy. Something to note * he doesn‚Äôt have his signature glove* Another key figure in this scene is Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.   At 1:43 Hellboy is fighting on a group of Giants. Possible Hellboy: Wild Hunt story element? In the comic he was able to kill six giants.   At 1:54  We get to see Ben Daimio as the WereJaguar! Its really fast and blurry though. From what I can tell he is NOT crimson in color. The overall design is very reminiscent of the US Being Human werewolf‚Ä¶.still can‚Äôt judge until I have seen more. Just keep this in mind   At 2:04 Hellboy emerges from some kind of pit? Full on ‚ÄúBeast of The Apocalypse‚Äù flaming crown, horns and a flaming excalibur‚Ä¶.so cool, just so cool   Last but not least some random stuff‚Ä¶  Hellboy‚Äôs hairline recedes when his horns grown and the crown is visible‚Ä¶..interesting?  Gruagach appears more than one time throughout this trailer.(duh) Considering David Harbour is 6‚Äô3, Gruagach is probably 8 to 9 ft tall in this adaptation. Also that scene when the old woman is shooting at the front of the store....and its a secret base......Captain America: The First Avenger anyone? I doubt that was the intention I'm just saying   *** I got to put this in here because surely someone will try to call me out for some reason, I‚Äôm just a fan, whether you agree with me or not is up to you. I‚Äôm just sharing my thoughts like everyone else, except the difference is I‚Äôm not going to throw a fit if the trailer didn‚Äôt meet my expectations. I also missed A LOT I am sure but I just gave some acknowledgment to the fact that this is more than likely a good movie and I wish it the best!***",4,4,GeekStudios 101,dt5g5_1cKVk,0.12317578772802654,2018-12-19 22:09:47,True,True

Mike Mignola said he wanted a reboot that was R-rated and closer in tone and spirit to the comics. So... he seriously made a movie that apparently feels exactly like del Toro's Hellboy for presumably somewhere in the $66-$85 million range instead of just making Hellboy III!?    Del Toro sat down with Mignola and the studio in February 2017 about making Hellboy III next after The Shape of the Water (this was right after he put a poll up on Twitter on February 18th asking whether fans still wanted it). On February 21st del Toro announced Hellboy III will never happen and he was moving on. On March 8th, Mignola announced an R-rated Hellboy reboot that was closer in tone and spirit to the comics.    I had made peace with the fact that I'd never get Hellboy III and was actually really looking forward to this darker reboot. I like Neil Marshall. I like David Harbour. Let's do this. Today we get a trailer for a Hellboy reboot that's far more del Toro than Mignola. I'm so fucking pissed right now.

You expect from the Hellboy comic flick to be a complete Guillermo Del Toro visionary - in parts grotesque - tale, which it doesn't even try to be and doesn't need to. The original movie was alright: it had nice characters, solid fights and eye-catching colour tones. But the sequel, entitled ""The Golden Army"", was such a money grab, such a messy tasteless pile of crap that it could even compete with Michael Bay's recent 'Transformers' entries. What I'm trying to say is don't push on this movie too hard for trying to be as funny as 'Thor: Ragnarok' or 'Deadpool'. First, let it come out, then watch it, and only then judge - by rights and not (I don't care).  By the way, seems like the director has got a better idea of embodying the main character than Del Toro himself.

Goofier than the other movies and in no way dark. Again, I have really high hopes because it‚Äôs rated R and because this is just a short trailer that most likely consists of just ‚Äúfunny‚Äù parts but still.  Do it right, I beg of you. I‚Äôm also trying not to let nostalgia change my view or opinions but come on, Ron Pearlman fit Hellboy so well with his voice, his attitude and everything else. This just seems off.

2018-12-20T00:39:02,My opinion on the original 2 and this trailer. Hellboy 1 & 2 were interesting and visually astonishing for its time and even to this day. But as films they both really sucked ass. I remembered them being fun and cool and when rewatching the 2 I could barely sit through them. Ron Perlman with his voice and attitude held those movies on his back without a doubt.  I love David Habor and I think he'll do a great job as he does with just about any role he takes on but I think I speak for many people when I say nobody was ready for this trailer. It lacks the things we've grown to enjoy with a cinematic hellboy. I think it will stay true to the comicbook fans for many of reasons but I worry that this movie will be a movie you can't wait to finish watching. I'm also not a fan of the cast members with the exception of Habor & McShane.  I'm still going to see it in theatres regardless!,0,0,sasquatch dude alex,dt5g5_1cKVk,0.353125,2018-12-20 00:39:02,True,True

2018-12-20T01:11:06,"Dear precious one, you may often wonder what does it take to maintain hope in harsh times? The answer is Watching. Waiting. Praying. Remembering. To our Heavenly Father in Jesus Christ name. In the Book of Micah, a man of God named Micah understood this reality. He was heartbroken by how Israel had turned away from God. ‚ÄúWhat misery is mine! . . . The faithful have been swept from the land; not one upright person remains‚Äù (7:1‚Äì2). But then he refocused on his true hope: ‚ÄúBut as for me, I watch in hope for the Lord, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me‚Äù (v. 7).               So again what does it take to maintain hope in harsh times? Micah shows us: Watching. Waiting. Praying. Remembering. God hears our cries even when our circumstances are overwhelming. In these moments, clinging to and acting in response to our hope in God is our strategy, the only strategy that will help us weather life‚Äôs storms.                 Navigate through the tunnel of darkness and into the Light by first understanding that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Elohim (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with love!              Dear friend, be of good cheer in praying the following prayer with me..... Heavenly Father, You‚Äôve promised to be an anchor for our hearts when circumstances look discouraging. Help us call out to You in faith and hope, believing that You hear our hearts‚Äô cries.  We honor You, we praise You, we thank You and we love You. This we pray in the Mighty name of Your Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Amen!!!!

I loved the first two movie though and I have seen the animations. With that being said I am not the most qualified to have a completely fact based opinion about this but... This really looks bad. I loved the darker vibe from hellboy. Humor works in there two but not slapstick. More like a pun based Humor. This really seemed off. The cgi looked bad too though it is ""just a Trailer cgi"". I was hyper After seeing the first few photos months ago but I think After this I am not going to watch it... Gotta wait and see for the second Trailer.

Also hell boy face looks down right terrible and the voice doesn't match one bit also he isn't really suppose to age they even Said  that  in the first movie and I think in the comics also his attitude is almost completely different when he gets shot  at he should have reacted like  who did it come on not screaming at everyone and the way he talks that doesn't sound like a old muscular hellboy and the sarcasm is just not the same funny or smartass as I rember it but this movie is not the movie for hell boy fans and comic book movie goers.,47,4,Rex Rockin,dt5g5_1cKVk,0.20400793650793653,2018-12-20 05:28:06,True,True

Ron Perlman will always be the face and voice of Hellboy for me, but just as Sean Connery's excellent performance of James Bond in the first films didn't discredit later actors for the character, I feel that David could pull off something really nice for this movie.

I'm actually quite hyped for this movie, even if the trailer is going a bit too lighthearted, leans WAY too hard on that song. You can have a dark movie that has a lighthearted bits- like Guillermo's Hellboy. Like Evil Dead 2. Like Zombieland. And the comics are darker, but no different. There's literally a part where Abe and HB take on a monkey with a gun, plus the line ""Don't mess with me lady, I've been drinking with skeletons"" always got a smirk out of me. I'm sad there's no Abe, he should DEFINITELY be here, but I'm still looking forward to this. Plus it's great to see him just out in the open, he was never quite as secretive in the comics as he was in Guillermo's films.  So what's everyone's problem? Just wait for the next trailer, or the movie itself. Or just don't watch it, Guillermo's movies and the comics aren't gonna magically disappear.  Also, I LOVE Ron Pearlman's Hellboy, but Aarbour's looks sick. The only problem I had was the face, but then I looked closer. It's scarred. Scars litter his body, and ESPECIALLY his face. This makes some sense, the dude gets into some nasty fights regularly. Plus there's something about that smirk 1:01 that I adore. Ron looks like Hellboy straight out of the comics. David looks like a fucking DEMON, especially here 2:06 where he even bares his teeth like a beast. Which, again, makes sense. Hellboy is meant to be an intimidating badass with a heart of gold, and I'm sold on that here.  And is NO ONE gonna mention the Baba Yaga's house? Or that we get Hecate played by an actress that was probably DYING for a change of pace?",0,1,Eva 64,dt5g5_1cKVk,-0.09087301587301587,2018-12-20 07:04:13,True,True

2018-12-20T12:03:00,They said from the beginning of the production that it will be a much more darker and serious R Rated adaptation than the previous movies. But the trailer makes it look just the opposite. Either they lied about the movie's tone or whoever did this trailer made a horrible job. Expectations were high for this movie but the trailer received generally bad reaction and managed to kill most of the hype it seems. Perhaps they could damage control the situation if they put out a better trailer before too late.

I like Harbour... I like HellBoy aspect... different from previous two. But, little perplexity about the STORY... I can see only on the trailer guns and like any stupid action movie the SAME PROCEDURE : A cynic guy with a gun, making some 'kidding' in worst moments... He is big and huge and look fierce, and other minimal characters around that does not have any sentiment... the just speak and move...  VERY FAST SCENES with lots of BANG BANG...  Mila Jovovich is not my favorite evil... and she is dressed in a stupid way ( does not look fierce or evil )  I expected slower scenes, real monsters and DARK creatures... being fascinated and feel fear, anxiety, surprise...  it does not happen with the trailer... hm. Sorry guys... I m real Hellboy fun... I hope the movie will be better !!! Even with low budget... EMOTIONS are what we expect from a film !!!

Complaining about it on Youtube won't change anything though.  Here; you want something different, funny, scary, sad, and triumphant? Here is a link to a Gofund me page and an accompanying Facebook page belonging to a disabled person who is trying to make something awesome. He has already had 2 academy award nominees read it and state that his story is a masterful work of comedic genius wrapped in a Lord of the Rings type universe where cannabis is a sacred herb used to enlighten.  This story makes fun of stupid social trends, certain idiotic politicians and celebrities, and asks us all to NOT judge a book by its cover. It is destined to be a classic and/or cult masterpiece. It is loaded with political and social satire and pokes fun at EVERYONE in hopes that we will all see how ridiculous we all can be. It is a great read that WILL make you want to see a movie about it. It WILL make you cry and laugh.  It has trolls. goblins, elves, dragons, and an assortment of classical fantasy species and some that you have never heard of before. Imagine Billy Crystal as a pot-smoking gnome who is also a holy man and a wizard and who is hoping to reintroduce his people to their creator and god through the use of cannabis. He enlists the aid of a Sasquatch comedian (who Dan Aykroyd expressed interest in playing), a nightmarish warlord battle-master thing, a giant lizardman, a bipedal rodent-like creature, and a being whose story is a mystery in itself.  The laughs are intense as are the tears and the elation of victory when it happens.  It is unbelievable that people will dish out $200,000 to a porn star rolling in money so she can sue her john, but they won't support someone who is honest, hard-working, and actually has something to offer the world. Terrible to say the least. This guy doesn't need $200,000 he is only trying to drum up $8,500 to publish his work so he will have something tangible to send to Peter Jackson, and Adam Macay (his fav directors).  Help the guy out, he is disabled and hates being on a disability pension. It has taken over 30 years to perfect this epic trilogy, over 320,000 words long. Self-sufficiency is all he wants (and to leave his son something when he passes away), and his work is brilliant. He is not lazy and has worked extremely long and hard to make this modern-day answer to The Lord Of The Rings meets Cheech and Chong.  https://www.gofundme.com/self-publishing-book-fund  https://m.facebook.com/The-Adventures-of-the-Great-Neblinski-by-JRR-Tokin-1774047899272119/?refid=13&__tn__=%2Cg",0,1,Volga Wolfhounds,dt5g5_1cKVk,0.07066544566544568,2018-12-20 16:35:27,True,True

2018-12-20T18:06:54,"Guess I'm in minority here but I really dig the trailer. I feel like it does a pretty good job establishing itself as it's own beast which it should. Hellboy 3 is dead it's sad but true, but I'm happy we're even getting a Hellboy movie at all. I think David Harbour is doing a fine job in his role and will come into his own as the movie progresses. I also actually like his makeup. Feels different enough to stand on it's own and it's kinda like a hybrid of the comic and the Del Toro version.  Other things to keep in mind.   1) Hellboy is a lot younger in this movie and less refined. Hes just trying to find himself.  2) This movie is low budget due to the R rating. Studios hate giving money to R rated properties because it cuts out a huge demographic that goes to see movies. Same thing happened with the first Deadpool.  3) Neil Marshall Is a kickass director. Watch The Descent and Dog Soldiers. Some fantastic gore, creatures, scares and humor in those. (Well humor in dog soldiers since it's a horror comedy)  4) Mike Mignola the creator of Hellboy is extremely excited about this version. He worked closely with them and loves what they are doing and hopes it does well so they can adapt his favorite stories. It actually follows closer to the Hellboy mythos and comics than the Del Toro ones. At least according to Mignola.  But look I do honestly get it. Hellboy is in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. I love it with my heart and soul. Change sucks and it's scary. But I wouldn't count this one out yet. And if does well it could kickstart a Hellboy series which would be fucking amazing.

There WILL be a lot of things we're not yet seeing, because they're R-rated. Hellboy has always been one to make little quips and silly jokes, while terrible, DARK, and GRITTY things are happening all around him. The creator, Mike Mignola, was very involved with this production, including writing and producing. There are already many MANY things in this trailer which should get a true Hellboy fan excited.

First thing I noticed was that the old Hellboy 1 and 2 cgi looked better than this extremely noticeable difference. I think the old had more practical effects which would make sense. Going full CGI instead of a great balance with reality is what's killing the scare factor of monsters. The animated ones in a real world without the right budget or animators feels so fucking weightless regardless of all the loud noises and shaky cams you put when it slams into something. And Mila..... Fucking really? Come on man. Resident Evil going so far down hill into even more goofy than the over the top franchise going into that realm with bad choreography in fights ripped straight from the game and just a shoddy use of CGI. Why would you inject her into this to? Her role in that never showcased any amazing acting since 3 onward I can't remember a stellar performance. So again. Fucking why?

Its the old dilemma between creativity versus making money. I think a lot of directors could do better if their creativity wouldnt be surpressed by the financial interests of the studios. Why does every film looks the same these days? Especially the super hero films? Because the studios have a pretty save formular of generating money. Its the style of Guillermo del Toro which makes us want to have a 3rd Hellboy. He creates a vivid and creative Hellboy-universe and therefor he sets the bar high.

I'm mostly curious about his interactions with Mila's character and that scene of him coming out of that hole with his full horns, flame crown and flaming sword. That part gave me some chills knowing how much others are interested in using him and his right hand for all the dark shit it's made for. I'm curious as to where this movie will take us.

As someone who‚Äôs watched (and loved) both of Del Toro and Ron Pearlman‚Äôs Hellboy films, I know how nostalgia and rose tinted glasses can make a great trailer like this seem ‚Äúdisrespectful.‚Äù I understand that the filmmakers have promised a gritty and darker Hellboy film, and we will get it, but that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre being shown here.  Hellboy, despite being rooted in horror, also had a lot of humor, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre being shown here. In fact, looking back on the filmmakers interviews about it, they said that this Hellboy would be a monster flick rather then a superhero film.  So guys, let‚Äôs all keep our minds clear of bias and judge this movie for what it is, and not what it‚Äôs supposed to be. I know that a lot of you will despise this film because it ‚Äúisn‚Äôt Del Toro‚Äù, but if we say that then this film won‚Äôt be what it was intended to be.   So let‚Äôs be opened minded and view this Hellboy movie as bias free as possible.",0,0,Noah Da. Ark,dt5g5_1cKVk,0.17689393939393938,2018-12-22 02:02:11,True,True

This looks as some say more like a Netflix movie and not impressed at all. Kinda feels like they are trying the whole Deadpool comedy Vibe which is the opposite to what people wanted from this Reboot... They wanted Darker not like GOTG. Hellboy just seems like The Hulk in this trailer and I hope I haven't more or less seen the full film there as they seem to have tried too hard to get as much in to convince people.

I'm going to have to give the makeup to Perlman's.  Although this Hellboy's crown looks very cool.  Harbour's voice doesn't have quite the expressiveness of Perlman's, and sounds a bit slushy.  I've seen it suggested below it's because of the makeup.  But his voice doesn't carry well when he's shouting, like when he got out of the cop van.  Speaking of getting out of the cop van... please drop that stupid stupid stupid ""my bad"" joke from the 90's.  Seriously.  Rewrite that scene.  Now.  Now.  Now.  Anyway, I still see a lot of the Hellboy character that Perlman portrayed in what Harbour is portraying.  We can't expect them to be identical.  And the makers of this movie made a good choice:  it's not a reboot.  The character isn't being reintroduced.  It takes place after the original movies.  So we aren't going to see Hellboy Reboot #234.  Perlman's portrayal of Hellboy was brilliant.  It will be difficult to top it.  But I'm willing to give this movie, and Harbour, a fair shake.

I would like to point out that a lot of people are saying it looks too comedic but even in the Comics Hellboy has humour and I think people are forgetting that the del Toro films had a large amount of humour to them.  For example Hellboy and Abe sitting in front of a fire getting drunk singing I can't live without you or Hellboy getting his face bounced off locker doors by a German steam geist.  A lot of people have said that his voice should be more deeper/ demonic as well but Ron Perlmans voice was his own, no deeper. Just slightly muffled at times from prosthetics.  I Love the original hellboy's but I am all for a new Direction that is closer to the comics and even though the trailer has a odd choice of soundtrack to it .I am more than willing to give this a chance because I think it has potential to be fantastic especially with the Creator so heavily involved.

2018-12-24T06:13:48,"no Ron Perlman.  i wont see this because of that. its not that im really a hardcore fan of Ron. But, when you change superhero's actors. the tone and feel of the character is changed dramatically.  What if The guy who plated Logan from the X-men, Hugh Jackman was replaced with leonardo dicaprio. the feel of the character. would be horrible. Ron got his role for the way he FITs the role, attitude, and feel. I understand what happen with Spiderman. but what happen really lowered the expectations of what the character that plays Spider man would be. When we see Tobey Maguire, we think. Spiderman. great acting. and a role that we can relate to and feel comfortable with. but when it was taken over by Tom Holland, the feel of the character seamed less confident, was more ""green"" (lack in fast thinking due to a lack of experience.) and the general script he is given doesnt seam very spider-man like. The swap from the 3 hulks where ... meanial. Eric Bana to Edward Norton to Mark Ruffalo. this wasnt because there was problems with the actors, but because the Hulk's Bruce David Banner was to be portray as a time lapse section. someone with incredible stress and and worry. it was to show the audience how such a thing changes people. and finally. Ryan Reynolds. He played as green lantern first. but then was made into Deadpool. why is this? well. Green Lantern wasnt a very fitting character for Ryan. at all. but. Deadpool was.

2018-12-27T20:08:52,"The whole trailer is ripped almost straight from the comics and as far as i can tell it looks really great for anyone who has read the comic and like utter shit to everyone else.    Which kinda is the big problem with this movie. Very few people actually know the source material when it comes to Hellboy. So everyone just expects it to be a whole different movie and on top of that are pissed at Hollywood rebooting another fan-favourite franchise.    But at least to me - big hellboy fan, comics as well as the movies - the trailer looks like it could be the adaption of the comics I always wanted, but never got to see, since Del Toro has such a strong directing style which overrode a lot of the comics influence. Don't get me wrong the movies are great and Ron Perlman is the best, but they never really captured the same feel I got when reading the comics.     I just hope for a good movie and I actually think a Hellboy reboot has a lot to offer if done right, but I fear it will go down like DREDD. An amazing genre movie, almost perfect adaption wise, but nobody turned out to see it, because they expect a redo of the original movie instead of a fresh start.

So I've been told by 2 friends who saw a prescreening of this that IT IS GRAPHIC AS F$%@!. Very, VERY violent with a hard R rating, and not so funny but very dark and demonic. Seriously demonic. They couldn't understand why or how Lionsgate went with this crap trailer as it's not even indicative of the plot. Gore and violence abound and Lobster Boy is quite prominent throughout the film. Abe Sapien IS in the movie, sorta, and Rasputin and Kroenen also play a role. They just emphasize that some of the violence is ultra bloody and there is good reason why this is an R rated film. I'm always a bit skeptical but they haven't let me down yet (both adamantly recommended Mandy and it may be one of my all-time favorite films).

The makeup done for Hellboy is just too distracting and too ugly. How is it that the original Hellboy movie, which is a fantastic movie btw don't know why they gone and remade it instead of making a third installment, that was made years and years ago has better make up, effects, and so far as I see in the trailer, have better comedy as well. Again, I'm still gonna see it and see how it actually is, you never know I mean the trailer can be misleading. My biggest problem is Hellboy's appearance. Okay, I'm done.  No I'm not, seriously I would have loved to see Red as a dad to twins!! To see how they would have made that worked, him and Liz being dynamic amazing parents, while also being friggin awesome demon fighting freaks.

All the R rated stuff can still be in it, but the trailer ruined a lot of the audience expectations for this film. This 3rd Hellboy movie was supposed to have the same emotional weight that the previous 2 Hellboy movies provided. Revise the Swat Scene shown in the trailer, make it more serious, but passively comedic in tone. Like the violent humor displayed in Kong Skull Island   LionsGate still has time to revise this film so that there are no cringey fight scenes and dialogue between characters.  Unless of course the movie is considered finished and there's no way to go back and save these scenes...

BARELY making it's money back.  First film had a production budget of $66M and made only $99M at the box office.  How this has become a series and NOW a reboot is baffling.  Hellboy 2 must've done stellar at the box office, right, to garner a reboot?  Not really.  $160.5M on an $85M budget?  It made a little money, but hardly enough to warrant a reboot.  But this is Hollywood now.  If it isn't a comic book movie it's a sequel.... if it's not a sequel it's a reboot.  In this case it's a rebooted comic book movie.  And the brain dead media wonder why movie ticket sales continue to dwindle with each passing year.  Hollywood is about as original as Milli Vanilli nowadays.  I can't remember the last time I saw a trailer and said ""DAMN, I absolutely HAVE to go see that.""  It's been MANY years I can tell you that.

Hellboy in the trailer didn't feel quite right to me. In the cartoon movie, Blood & Iron. 1. He's more of the quiet type. 2. He *CAN* have fun and have funny moments, but since he's more of the quiet type, the funny is more in his actions, like when he thinks he's got it right and then figures out he got it wrong. 3. He's actually smart and level headed as well in many situations. And when he says, ""It smashes real good"", you already know he got knocked down a peg. How the characters look are actually pretty good, they look fine, but it's really in the acting and how good the ppl play their parts that'll determine whether or not this movie is worth going to in my opinion. When this gets in theaters, it doesn't look bad, it just kinda feels bad from the trailer, but we should give it a chance at the very least before really digging into it and calling it rlly bad, even though it's just the trailer. But since Cpt. Marvel was so bad in terms of how ppl were ""advertising"" it, les hope tht we don't go down that HELL-hole (get it, cuz the... Never mind) again. So, chances are, if ppl don't like it when it comes out in theaters, then that's fine, everybody has their opinion on the movie. But, the more ppl who say it's good, the more ppl will watch it, but if ppl say it's not rlly worth spending yr money on, then much less ppl will be inclined to go watch it.

I always felt The Golden Army was alright, but a lot lighter in tone and too silly when compared to the original.  I wasn't looking forward to seeing ""mommy and daddy"" Liz and Hellboy raising two hellboy babies, either.  This movie was a completely different take for the character.  They stayed away from using characters and situations that we'd already seen in the previous movies to keep things fresh.  I actually prefer Hellboy's look in this film.  The crimson flesh color looks a lot better than the bright red color from the original films and I never liked Hellboy's bald head, either.  Overall, the look of Hellboy fits the character a lot better in this film.  There are also some very interesting situations that Hellboy finds himself in, that are only hinted at in the old series, but are explored a lot more in this film.  If you can set aside your grudge that Hellboy 3 was probably never going to happen and you're willing to see a grittier take on the character and source material, with as much stuff from the comics as they could throw in there, you'll enjoy the movie for what it is.  The saddest thing is that the 2 after credit scenes gave a glimpse of some awesome things that were to come in the sequel and now we'll probably never see that film become a reality, either.",1,0,CABAL 313,dt5g5_1cKVk,0.29845679012345677,2019-05-25 19:00:29,False,True

2020-01-14T21:36:40,I know I am in the extreme minority when I say this but I really enjoyed this movie. I think David Harbour nailed it as Hellboy! I would love to see a sequel to this but because people were unwilling to give it a chance because it wasn't another Del Toro/Perlman movie it bombed so a sequel will probably never happen. I feel really sorry for David Harbour because he worked so hard to play the role the right way and I would love to see what he would do next with the character. So well done everybody for not giving this movie the support it deserved. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.üò°üò†üëø,2,2,Irish Emo Girl,dt5g5_1cKVk,0.19933862433862434,2020-01-14 21:36:40,False,False
