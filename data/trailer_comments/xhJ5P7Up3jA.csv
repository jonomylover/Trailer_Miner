That's why part 1 had zero replay value. Left the theater happy, but turned the DVD off 5 minutes into my second viewing months later.

I mean this mans taking his loss personal.  2-Pennywise made some creepy ass faces in the hall of mirrors thing and you really feel the emotion in James McAvory pleading for him not to hurt, I’m guessing, his son.  3-I think the guy that was laughing crazy is Henry bowers, cause he tries to terrorize the losers in the book.  4-Also notice how we don’t see older Stanley at all in this trailer and in the trailer there is a bloody hand in a bathtub and if you remember from the mini series Stanley kills himself after remembering about penny wise. So my guess is that’s his hand in that bathtub.   Can’t wait for this movie! Loved the first one and this one looks like it might be better with delivering with the scares and gore.  Edit: @2:15 it looks like Richie is trying to stop someone from getting killed. Possibly Eddie getting killed by penny wise cause it looks like at the end Richie finishes screaming Eddie and it would make sense cause they’re like best friends.

2019-07-18T21:32:15,"1.) I'm pretty sure I saw the Ritual of Chüd. In both the scene where they are in a circle with joined hands and the scene with a character (I am guessing Bill) falling into a bright doorway. 2.) The beginning is no doubt the death of Adrian Mellon. 3.) The scene in the House of Mirror is absolutely new but looks like it will be a great addition.

As a U.S. Military Brat and an Adirondacker and a mom and a Medicine Woman, I'm interested in security, so I specialized and became an Economist as well.), (B.A. Sociology, University of Washington, Seattle, 2000 C.E., 3.55 G.P.A.), Certified Teacher (CTEFLA, St. Giles, San Francisco, 1996 C.E.), Medicine Woman, U.S. Military Brat, Autist, Department of Homeland Security Operative, and The Owner (as a result of having written the legal code adherence factor standard code known as the binumerial system/code to replace the binary code in a deliberate legal move to improve God's sanity four years ago and thus became the legal unit legally responsible for the legal management of every legal unit, the binumerial system/code being: 1001: make the most responsible and mature legal choice you can make at every juncture. DO YOU NOTICE HOW A PHALLUSED LEGAL UNIT DIDN'T DO THAT? I'M THE ONLY ONE EVER WHO PROVED TO BE INTELLECTUALLY MATURE ENOUGH TO PROVE, MATHEMATICALLY, WITH LEGALITIES, INCLUDING BEING RESPECTING OF GOD'S SANITY, AFORETHINK THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS REALITY EXISTS AND HOW ONE IS LEGALLY REQUIRED TO CONDUCT ONESELF despite the drama-lovers and fantasy-seekers and addicts and other underachievers petitioning for a different level of regard. Petitioning isn't legal. Words are jargon. Math is the only legal language. I have the math that ends terrorism, including the terrorism of homelessness (did you ever notice there isn't such a thing as a homeless ant or a homeless chipmunk or a homeless hippo? That's because homelessness is a contrived problem easily eliminated by getting rid of the folks who have been obstructing justice by insisting folks play pretend and never agree on reality much less do math. I'm done with terrorism. I have two Scottish/Native American kids and I will not abide by them being abused by bitches who want them to perform Christmas for them when the math exists that proves that cults and their terrorism [math-evading] fundraisers [a.k.a. religious holidays] aren't legal.) and the terrorism of police brutality against both U.S. Military members (I could present to a congressional committee or the U.N. on this topic. I have the data that proves the po-po are actively working against U.S. Military members.) and the general public, including Batkid, and ensures a U.S. Military victory (and, believe me, the U.S. Military is paying attention to this math achievement of mine because math wins wars. Christmas doesn't win anything for anyone. One is burning down the environment to buy favors from folks and advocating for never being held legally-accountable at all when one ""celebrates"" the pedophiliac ritual known as Christmas and, yeah, I said ""pedophiliac"" on purpose because Christmas doesn't benefit kids or the environment at the fuck all. Christmas is about children getting pumped up with bullshit to provide the ""grown-ups"" with an emotional orgasm the ""grown-ups"" don't deserve. I'm not going to be grateful to a phallused legal unit ever for providing me with anything. I still haven't been able to find a phallused legal unit who is interested in speaking math with me, they all want to take their groin retards on a walk whilst thinking of Jesus instead. Show me your math work and let me know when you are someone whose opinion I oughta consider respectable. My math ends the draft. I'd think a former U.S. Navy Seal like you would be impressed, but maybe U.S. Navy Seals aren't as erudite as they market themselves to be.

2019-07-19T09:07:48,") In May 2019, members of the Minnesota House of Representatives and the Minnesota Senate sent official letters to the Minnesota Medical Association (MMA) expressing concern over forced organ harvesting in China.    The letters from the House of Representatives and the Minnesota Senate, written by Representative Nels Pierson (R-Stewartville) and Senator Jim Abeler (R-Anoka), were supported by 77 House and Senate co-signers, two of whom are practicing physicians. Both letters expressed concern over Minnesota residents obtaining unethically sourced organs from countries such as China and also mentioned concern over, “…Chinese medical personnel who are trained in Minnesota that may assist in forced organ harvesting.”    The MMA is a non-profit professional association that represents Minnesota physicians, residents, and medical students.    From a Minnesota government press release:    “We need a plan and guideline to prevent anyone from profiting from this horrendous practice in China,” said Sen. Abeler (R-Anoka). “It is vital that we continue to condemn forced harvesting and discourage our citizens from taking advantage of this crime against humanity. Senator Carolyn Laine (DFL-Columbia Heights) declared, “This is a serious human rights issue and we all need to take a vocal stand on this practice.”    The Minnesota legislature has focused on the issue of the persecution and forced organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners since 2014. In that year, members of the Minnesota House of Representatives wrote a letter to the Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Office of Higher Education. The letter inquired about any potential collaboration between China and Minnesota regarding organ transplantation.",0,0,mei li,xhJ5P7Up3jA,-0.0773809523809524,2019-07-19 09:07:48,True,True

2019-07-19T13:38:54,Me and my wife husband wife and children loved this film. Definitely the best action adventure comedy of the summer! Just look Bill Harder is right there. The girl who killed Osama bin Laden does a great job playing the female all the guys railroaded in the end credits scene from the first one. This time her period is a bigger and bloodyre deal. We loved it so much we all got coke stained loser tattoos on ours arms. The giant turtle does make an appearance in this when the ushers had you a pipe to smoke while you complain about your alcoholic father not some actually interesting layered work of art like Kubrick made. (Just saying dr sleep will be better than the shining) Anyway the film was great it even showed bits of stranger things season 5 when plot was missing unlike in the books.

Because the book contains a lot more graphic stuff, that is MAYBE to hard to handle in a movie.   Like for example the death of Patrick Hockstetter, too bad they didn't show it in the movie.

When Adrian Mellon (presumably) is going up and down in the water at around 24-29 seconds of the trailer, you first see a blurry image of a light which seems like it might be light coming in from the tunnel's entrance.  But then when he comes up from the water again, there are two very focused balls of light.  You then see Pennywise again, and then you see one of the balls of light take on a malevolent glow.  It  looks very much like the ball of light the child sees under the bleachers in the first trailer, or the deadlights Beverly see in the first movie when Pennywise splits his head open and puts her into the trance.

With only a few scenes featuring Georgie he makes us feel his brother's intense agony of remorse. Feels as if he REALLY was an illusion of pain controlled by Pennywise. And it's not just ""It"". How can be a kid so talented? I'm definitely going to watch all the films with Jackson. And back to ""It"", of course I'm ready to sit in the cinema for 3 hours. And for It's sake, I swear to Penny that I'm gonna argue with next person who whines about the film being bad beside the book. I can agree that many films are, well, ""not really hitting the point"". But not this one. The film will never give the same feeling as the book does, that's true, but ""It"" is simply a good film.

2019-08-24T22:24:34,"The leader is funny! Do we meet Satan when we cross over? That's what I was thinking 10 years ago. I had this image in my mind of myself as this muscular, huge, Satanic being with huge horns telling the little grays and reptilians following me, ""I know...you all come after me. And uh....you should shoot me in the eye!"" Then the little grays and reptilians fall onto the ground laughing. I was guided by the aliens to go to this market in Bangkok where I saw this painting of a huge Buddha with all of these little reptilians and other beings pointing their spears at him. Then I saw some paintings of spaceships and I think that these artists were telling me that they believed that we would have a third world war? There were other little clues that I found: a painting of Queen Elizabeth, Mickey Mouse with devil horns, a shirt that said ""Leave me alone,"" and a little squirrel that was chained by the neck inside of it's cage. Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage. Smashing Pumpkins. I think the celebs started the conversation in the chatroom by saying, ""Penises and vaginas! We love these things! We love war! I'm Cameron Diaz and I know what it's like to swim freely in the ocean as a dolphin! And I'm Dave Grohl and I know what it's like to be squished as a cockroach! I don't want to look like a stupid clown. I look stupid enough. The aliens can control me to walk to the beat of the music. I notice myself doing this. I stop and then I start doing it again when I do start walking. The aliens controlled me to park next to a nice car for about 3-4 months? I noticed this at some point in my life. The aliens can show me clues using the cars around me. The aliens can control traffic, crowds, and whole cities. I heard that when someone important comes to town in NYC, people feel it. Madonna talked to me about being a part of a studio audience. Aliens use their powers to get everyone to clap in sync with each other. I think the aliens had me speak to a clone of my classmate in 2013. We went to the Mother Clucker's restaurant and there were maybe 10 cops sitting at a table in the corner. I didn't know that this classmate was a clone, but I think that someone may have told me this. She's just weird like that! She goes cross-eyed! I think the stalker has the alien power to make me go cross-eyed. I know I've done this a few times when he's been around. I know that I've stopped breathing when he's around me at the library. I've noticed this while sleeping at home too. There was one night where I lay in bed feeling so scared for some reason. I just kept saying to myself, ""Jesus be above me, behind me, and all around me."" I said this to myself over and over again and Madonna knew that I had done this. The other kid that was sitting with Mayim Bialik, who was interviewing me during lunch time while the other kids were away, was Troy who looks like the albino hunchback from ""The Princess Bride."" I think that I spent a lot of time observing him and his best friend, Jessica, who looked like a princess. I think she lived on Palmcroft Lane. Troy always seemed to have a runny nose and he had a nasaly voice. There was a first grader who asked me if I knew what a ""reason"" was. I had absolutely no idea. I was just in first grade. I have this memory of this guy named Patrick Brennan, who may have been in kindergarten or first grade with me, and in this memory, I am hovering above him and his mother at the grocery store. The other Troy was in another first grade class. I believe that there were 3 classes. I heard that Troy was also at the summer camp after Kindergarten with me. I have no memory of him before high school. I think that Troy may have used his alien powers to change my book report at the last minute to focus on something sexual in ""A Brave New World""? I know that I did some kind of last minute change before I went up. Then the teacher said that I should be ashamed of myself and I was kind of shocked. This teacher also called me jello (My Best Friend's Wedding). And this teacher refused to write me a letter of recommendation? I think that she would make disrespectful comments about me to my younger sibling. I went to this teacher's viewing, which was held at the high school. I heard that many people went to one student's viewing. He may have been the first to die in our class. No one told me about this, so I didn't go, but supposedly he raped me. I actually tried to call his mother in 2008. I have many memories of Melanie Middleton. I remember her trying to teach how to pronounce ""memo pad,"" but kept saying ""memor"" and I told her that it was ""meh-mo."" I remember seeing her family at McDonald's when I was about 6. My sibling and I were dressed in matching fluorescent yellow outfits. I remember playing Fire Brigade with her and I think she dumped the bucket of water on me or stepped on my toe. I don't remember playing with Brent. I remember having 2 copies of ""Mr. Lee's Roses"" in the classroom and like 9 copies of the books about aliens, which no one wanted to read.",0,0,Kim Le,xhJ5P7Up3jA,0.09624133281972266,2019-08-24 22:24:34,True,True

This led to me getting a dog(recently  my grandma and my dog died and my dogs girlfriend had puppies and I wanted something  to remember him as but those were my friends dogs she said I could have some so I Expected that as a birthday gift)  everyone raised their hand except me the clown looked at me and said “well why not?”   I started to tear up And some dumb kid yelled HER STUPID DOG DIED and everybody laughed even the clown  I busted into tears and cried  and ran away  I could hear my mom looking for me but I didn’t want to be found  I turned around and screamed          AW MAN THEIR WAS A CREEPER BEHIND ME it exploded and I lost everything even my trident that was full of enchantments,1,2,Dank Memes,xhJ5P7Up3jA,0.25859374999999996,2019-09-04 20:48:12,False,True

How they save each other, through love :) aWwwwWWWWWWWW man! gosh. thank you for this flick. and LOVE James Ransone. He and Bill by the end make SUCH a great duo, of BFFs.

But I want to share with you my unbelievable story, this random stuff happens maybe once in a lifetime so if u are not interested, stop reading. I am from Slovakia and I have a girlfriend named Viktoria (Victoria in english). We saw first chapter one year ago and ever since I've always been talking to her like Pennywise said to Georgie in very first scene ""Hi Georgie! Wanna catch a balloon?"". But I was saying to her ""Hi Viky!"" in his voice all the year when we were talking about this movie or just when I wanted to scare her little bit or just for fun. And as I was saying, we were on Chapter 2 today and if you saw it, there was some random girl called Victoria and she was catching this insect (I don't know how it's called in english) and she met Pennywise and guess what!!! He said to her ""Hello Vicky!"" .............. What are the fu**ing odds that some random girl called Victoria is going to appear in second chapter and ""It"" will tell her this sh*t which I have been saying to my girlfriend FOR ONE YEAR !!! I just can't believe this, just take all the names in America she could have been named anyhow and that girl couldn't even been there !!

Bill Sarksgard was realy great as Pennywise and i realy love him, but i liked the 1990 ending waaay better, eaven if the remake is all in all closer to the book. Attention spoiler: The CGI effects are not so good and they made some stuff ""extra""... Also they tuned down the heavy abuse Beverly is going through and her struggles to escape her crazy violent stalking husband and how she deals with her horrible past. And in part 2 she eaven HUGS her rapist daddy and lovingly covers him with a blanket??? Oh c'mon! In part one (and the book) she was completley terrified and repulsed of him and eaven cut her hair when he touched it..in part 1 she almost killed him with the toilet cover as he deserves, and now she hugs him? Bevys sufferings are a very important topic in the book and its it completley played down in this version. Also the part of Bills wife, travelling after Bill and robbed by Pennywise is somehow completley non existent and so his bike Silver never truly can fullfill its purpose in this movie. And Pennywise never turns fully in to its original form of  a huge extraterrestrial Spider, (but his half-spider round massive bum is bigger and rounder than Kim Kardashians i must say!🍑) But instead of the horrible ugly spider he turns in the end into a cute baby(?), and they kill the baby wtf???🙈🙈🙈 Oh yes and Bill  DROWNS the ghost of his little so much beloved brother Georgie he mourned for the last 27 years???😲😲😲..double wtf!!!",0,0,Ms XY,xhJ5P7Up3jA,0.01288310185185182,2019-09-05 23:02:57,False,True

Over 2 hours of cheese and the actor who played Pennywise can't act for shit. Only decent but in the entire movie was the queer man getting beaten up at the beginning and threw into a river then Pennywise killing him after that.

Although this one had some well made jumpscares… others were predictable and quite boring… Also was is that hard to think of new monsters? Only the end version seemed new. - very all over the place... too many flashbacks. i get it but it was too much - too much cgi, too much gore (the scary part of the first one was what you didnt see but could predict). The conclusion scene with the kid could have been better handled and they missed a good jumpscare there. - what the hell is with that ending (the way they beat IT)? AM i the only one to think it was lame?? - on that note... what the hell was IT's plan. Was it a grudge?? Oh yeh, lets bring back the group that almost killed me last time!

I'm a staunch moviegoer of horror/psychological thrillers and I gotta say It chapter 2  gave me a renewed sense of the genre--while also scaring the fuck out me at times. Much like Insidious, it does well in weaving psychological motifs into a gradient of subtle to overt horror jumpscares. The casting was perfect, from the getgo you really feel the deeply buried trauma the characters carry upon their first gathering. I think book-to-film movies often dilute their original subject material with Hollywood tropes, but Muschietti and Dauberman developed an involved script that had audiences really feel the bond between all of the main characters.

2019-09-09T03:54:09,"This comment has spoilers of the movie. If you haven’t watched IT Chapter 2 and don’t want spoilers, *DO NOT READ.*      So I watched IT Chapter 2 today and for the ending, I was disappointed at the ending. The ending and the origin was more of a sci-fi, which didn’t fit with the movie imo. I didn’t like how at the fortune cookie scene, there was stupid creatures coming out of them. The ritual stuff and the other tribe things were just not fitting for the movie. I know how it’s from the books and all, but it didn’t go well with the movie. And I really wanted to see the part where pennywise jumps on the wall because it looked like a good scene but it didn’t end up in the final production. And the one thing I hate a lot, is at the end where pennywise’s head is smashed flat and there is little baby hands coming out of him, it was just way too goofy for a horror movie and it was similar to the gingerbread man in space movie where one of the people’s heads gets flattened with a pan. That was just the negative things I had to say.   Positive things: I really loved the other part of the movie, it was comedic and horror at the same time. It was also really sad seeing Stan commit suicide and Eddie dying. This is one of the times where when a movie reveals someone is gay, that it is great. I’m not saying I’m homosexual or anything, none of that. It’s just most of those times that happens, it’s like a J.K. Rolling kind of style, it just comes out of the blue and makes no sense. It was sad seeing at the end, Ritchie completing the “R + E” carve where Ben got his stomach carved by Henry and the bullies in chapter 1.  It was sad to me how he married a woman just to show that he “isn’t gay” so people wouldn’t know. Okay, well I think people knew because in one of the scenes, Ritchie is fighting Henry’s little cousin in Street Fighter and when Henry shows up he says that he wants to do gay stuff with him and that and Henry says “Ritchie wants to bone my little cousin?” and Ritchie runs off. I think he married a woman to hide that he was gay so all those “accusations” would look false. I was also sad when Ritchie saw Eddie dying when he gets stabbed my pennywise after saying that he beat him. Ritchie kept making himself believe that Eddie was still able to live, but was wrong.The writing is really good and the jumpscares.   Overall, I give the movie a 9.2/10 I feel like the anticipation was kinda overhyped but I’d say it was worth to wait a while to release. The editing is kinda goofy but most of the movie is just really good. I loved how the movie was 2 hours and 50 minutes, so there was more move time. I think where they should’ve headed in the backstory is that he was a regular clown or something and something evil possessed him or something like that. I didn’t like how it was just that a meteor came down from the sky and there was a demon inside it. I thought that the part where pennywise was like “how poor” (or whatever he says) and where he had makeup coming off his face was from his backstory and not him talking to Beverly. If there was anything you disagreed with me on, you can tell me in the reply section. Anyways, great movie!",4,2,Jxsh,xhJ5P7Up3jA,0.11180087916199026,2019-09-09 03:54:09,False,True

2019-09-10T19:07:17,"My rating: 6/5 stars  Yep! ""IT"" deserves the extra star, imho..! Here's my spoiler free review. Thanks if you take the time to read it ☺  It Chapter 2 follows the Losers' club 27 years after nearly killing Pennywise. The 2nd chapter differs a bit from the book, and the mini series that came out in 1990 (also based on the book).   There is a character twist that is initially subtly hinted, and is finally revealed at the end of the movie (even though the book leaves it ambiguous).  The movie omits any reference to the ancient turtle named Mataurin, and the torrential rain that happens after Pennywise is killed.   But, there's a ""Here's Johnny!"" reference (from The Shining movie, also based on Stephen King's book). That is quite a surprising bonus scene there, which I love very much.  One scene (the 'thing' that came out of the fridge) is a reminiscent of The Thing (1982), another favourite horror movie of mine.  For me, this is a very satisfying movie. I'm glad that:   • the 2nd chapter avoids delving too much into the two minor characters in the book (Bev's husband and Bill's wife).  • the kid actors have plenty of screen times in this 2nd Chapter. Unlike the mini series, which divided the storylines into two: when they were kids and as adults. • the ending is so satisfying and ""realistically"" portrayed.. Can't blame the mini series though, probably due to limited budget and technology at that time.   I can relate to all the seven characters (especially Bev, Richie and Eddie) and their childhood experiences. If this were real life, I would have fitted in their Losers' Club perfectly.   Despite already know the ending beforehand, IT Chapter 2 still managed to make me feel very sad.. Watching a horror movie but end up crying? Yep.. That's IT... !!  So, if this is your first time watching it, prepare to feel like your guts have just been ripped out.   The movie is rated R (or 18+ in Msia) for good reasons. Some scenes are quite disturbing for younger viewers.  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156514031037157&id=5209721",0,0,abduntube,xhJ5P7Up3jA,0.10836681547619048,2019-09-10 19:07:17,False,True

Timestamps are 2:10 and 2:14  The scenes specifically are Bev being held underwater and Mike looking up at Pennywise as he catches his balance on a wall. (Spoiler-ish ahead)   I'm guessing the first scene with Bev would've been when she was grabbed by the old woman and dragged underwater near the end of the film, where the Losers are making their way to the final confrontation with Pennywise. In that scene, where it would've been, all of the Losers except for Eddy go underwater to save Bev, but the camera just stays with Ed, as he just pleads to the group that he wants to be able to make it out, or something. I don't remember what exactly it was he was begging for in the film.   The second one, I don't know. It looks like it would've been Mike's dream/hallucination if he were in the same boat as Ben and Bev when each respectively were pulled into nightmares of their own, Ben being trapped underground in the Losers' hideout, and Bev being drowned by blood in the bathroom. Maybe Pennywise would've brought Mike to The Black Spot, and that's actually what we see in the shot. It's just a guess, though.

I couldn’t help but notice that as I was watching it in the theater, I was constantly waiting and yearning for Pennywise to have screen time or for the adults to legitimately be afraid. Don’t get me wrong, the acting and casting was phenomenal; Bill did a phenomenal job once again as Pennywise, hence why I felt disappointed by his lack of scenes. This film just felt too different in comparison to the first....the trailers unfortunately showed off all of the good scares and the Pennywise scenes, making it seem like it’d be similar to the first in terms of sheer tension and horror. That was not the case, as this film steers more in the direction of an adventure film; Pennywise feels more like the mini series Pennywise who is more goofy and comical as opposed to the violent, sadistic and darkly humorous version in the 2017 film.

He says “flesh tastes better with fear in it” that’s why he is constantly trying to scare the kids before eating them. Why kids you ask? Because kids are the easiest to scare and their flesh is young and newer. Pennywise’s enemy is actually a turtle that threw up our planet when he had a stomach ache lol.

2019-09-21T18:09:50,"I saw people giving 1 star reviews for the pre-order for this movie on Amazon because of ""bad language"". That's hilarious and too good to be true. Its difficult nowadays for a film to merit an R-rating in today's culture and I think this film did it successfully. Not just with the language but with the scary imagery and the violent bloodiness of the kill scenes. Also there was another who said something along the lines of ""Mike is the poor black man who didn't leave Derry. This movie is racist. News Flash! Its 2019!"" When I saw that I knew whoever wrote that completely missed the point that Mike was well off in his position and he was an educated ""gatekeeper"" of the past they shared against IT, should the monster return. The politics of these woke persons just have to seep into entertainment and look for imperfections that simply don't exist, projecting their own hatred of the world onto things that don't warrant that hatred. I'm not saying that IT chapter 2 is a perfect movie, far from it. It is however a sufficient follow up to its predecessor and if you are a fan of the previous film then you're likely to enjoy this, not certainly but likely. Outliers will be outliers, after all it does divert from the context of the book's source material for the film experience. However, it is entertaining when given a fair chance. The climax to how IT is ultimately defeated was the only thing that I probably would have wanted an alternative to. Other than that it was alright for what it was. It is not for the young ones, people going after it for language should really ask themselves what makes them such moral arbiters of upstanding etiquette between adults in reality. Last I checked, adults use profanity when they're among friends. The difference is that when the Losers were in their professional settings before going to Derry, among business associates and people in work, they weren't using profane language. However when they were in good company, among their friends, they were free to talk the way they wanted (especially Richie). Not that it really matters, but most of the Losers Club were not being profane anyway. That's all I have to say about that. Also, rotten tomatoes is a rotten tomato now. No longer accepting critical reviews from that site, the biased is obvious and ridiculous.",0,0,Coconut Head,xhJ5P7Up3jA,0.05315334467120182,2019-09-21 18:09:50,False,True

Them being adults removes that helplessness of being a child and gives them odd advantages. Besides, isn't it something like ""Only children can see Pennywise?"" So wouldn't that mean that they wouldn't be able to see him? Finally, why is there still a romance between those two kids? I can understand the whole ""middle school sweethearts"" thing but they're well into their thirties at this point and have moved on with their lives for the most part, so their little immature romance would long be forgotten right? Or at least make it so they've been married this whole time, and they come back together as a couple. I haven't watched any of the movies and I can still tell this is nothing more than a cash-grab.

2019-10-13T11:34:50,"My review: Verdict - Blockbuster Storyline - This movie carries on from the previous part whereas this movie is set after 27 years whereas before they were kid and now they are grown up adults whereas the character has been changed for this movie, but the IT which is the clown whereas the name is pennywise and this stays the same, however this movie story is about getting all character back because IT has returned, however this movie, you do need to use your brain from the flashback of last part with some new added scenes from their childhood, however the IT is dangerous this time because the way it eats the children is deadly and the way the IT tries to revenge these kid of which he failed is deadly, but this movie is slow pacing and the runtime movie is too long, however there is no way of which this movie could have cut the scenes, because the director tries to make sure that this movie makes sense, however it may be hard for the audience to remember from important scenes of part 1 which links to the kid of what they done and some important messages, but you need to avoid using your brain and leave it outside and just enjoy it because the way the clown moves like one of the scene of which he walks like an big spider in the climax scene is amazing and one of the scene of which the girl is in her old home where it used to be her father house as the IT uses the old lady body to scare her and the way he speaks is so good and it makes you love this movie especially when he sits on the top of the statue and there is red balloon flying across the sky and the first time the IT appears is just amazing as it makes you watch the movie without feeling boring, however this movie is not scary, it is just bloody thriller movie and it is movie of which just makes you laugh because there is lack of scares, however if we move onto the plot, you will get to know information of pennywise the clown that he did had daughter, this is when the girl goes to an old lady house and how pennywise clown came back, you need to watch it and in this movie, the pennywise clown uses someone to kill the people of which he did not killed from 27 years ago instead of himself of which this failed because they fought back, however in the first half of the movie they did tried to look at the past to find information in order to kill pennywise which can be useful for them, but each of them goes individual and pennywise tries to kill them by using other person body and some character had nightmare from their childhood like when the fat body was in school and he sits next to the best friend which is an girl, but she was actually IT, however in this plot, where one of the character got an message that IT will eat the little body of which they knew him in the beginning where all character meet each other in the restaurant and he tries to save him in the scene where it is in the fun fair in the mirror reflections, but then all of them went back to the IT house and got something of which I won't give an clue, but you do need to watch it and they use this to get IT killed, this is like an theories of the way you kill IT and they do got to this house and IT uses the body shaping of their childhood and he does uses his force to put them separate and scare them using the shaping from their father and local shop people from their childhood, but eventually they got together and tries to put the IT in the box, but this failed and they did managed to get rid of him, but one character does die of which I won't reveal, but you do need to see,.. Type of movie -  Thriller/Horror, bloody violence Performances - Every character did an amazing job and some characters are not that famous in real life, but they done good for this movie, but the one stands out is the pennywise clown whereas his dialogue, movement and the way he speaks is just essential Is there more information you need to know - You need to watch this movie because one of the person who is in this group is not in this movie, but comes at the end, why, you need to watch it...

Andy Muschietti could really do something great here but he prefer to do all the crappy hollywood shit and completely destroy the dark and creepy novel feeling.

The losers come back and try to defeat the killer clown. The losers get flashbacks to their younger selves and also go back to their childhood landmarks and find where Pennywise scared them most.
