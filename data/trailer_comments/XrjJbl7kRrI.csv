2014-12-05T14:46:11,"I wish someone would make a film about how neoliberalism has betrayed democracy and all those who fought to defend it.  Here is a letter from a 90 yr. old British WWII veteran:  ""We have somehow broken our solemn bond with those warriors of yesterday and forgotten that when the survivors of the Second World War returned to their homes, they were like a tide that raised all boats. My generation's shared experience of suffering, of witnessing genocide, ethnic cleansing, and enduring unspeakable privations as both soldiers and civilians made us vigilant when it came to demanding our peace dividend. We knew what we deserved and that was a future that didn't resemble our hard-scrabble past. The Green and Pleasant land was for everyone after the war because we had bled for it and died for it. We demanded a truly democratic society where merit was rewarded and no one would be left behind because of poverty, poor health or an inadequate education.  Today, however, in a world where our reservoirs of wealth are as deep and enormous as all the mighty rivers of the world combined, our politicians, financial institutions and megalithic industries tell us we can no longer afford these human rights that men sacrificed their lives for: the freedom to live with dignity in a compassionate society. We are told by those in charge that we can no longer live with luxuries like healthcare, proper state funded pensions, decent wages, trade unions and most aspects of our social safety network.  At 90, I am too old to take up the fight, too old to stand in demonstrations with a placard denouncing this madness. All I can do is bear witness to my times and our heroic struggle fought so long ago against Hitler and against men who would wreck the foundations that made civilisation tolerable and decent for its inhabitants.  The problem with society, today, is not lack of money or debt but lack of ideas, lack of commitment by our government to realise that its constituents are the people, not city bankers and hedge fund managers whose loyalty is to their ledger books rather than to the community. I don't know if we will come out of this present darkness. Perhaps humanity will simply retreat into the caves whence our ancestors came because we were cowed by self-serving political parties and dubious leaders of business. I hope not, for the sake of the generations to come, but there is one thing I am certain of: had the politicians and business mandarins of today been in power in 1939, they wouldn't have had the bottle to fight Nazism. There would have been no Dunkirk, no Battle of Britain, no Finest Hour. Our leaders today on either side of the house would have allowed the lights across Europe to grow dim, because after all that would have been the cheapest and most prudent solution to Hitler's tyranny.""  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/09/is-camerons-britain-what-we-fought-for",0,0,IHeart MMT,XrjJbl7kRrI,0.07020626432391137,2014-12-05 14:46:11,True,True

2014-12-15T08:35:35,"I rarely write a comment on YouTube, but now I need to, after reading some of the misleading comments and disputes here.  - I will only focus on past wars. We all hate war and should work toward peace. But, that doesn't mean that we should forget about the past; we should constantly learn from the past to make a better future. I won't talk more on ""how"" we should see history, since we can go on and on and have another huge discussion about it.  - I agree that all countries, including Japan, Germany, US, and Korea, have their ugly sides when it comes to war. We all know about the inhumane acts done by some American soldiers in Iraq, and we all know about the Holocaust. I'm Korean, and I'm also aware of the violence and killings done by the Korean soldiers during the Vietnam War. And I believe that we should make a sincere apology and appropriate compensation to Vietnam, just like Japan should to Korea and other countries/peoples they so inhumanely obliterated. But again, I won't talk about the whole bunch of what is ""sincere"" and ""appropriate"" here. At least, I believe that many would agree that what German government has done - both to the victims and to themselves - to compensate for what their previous generations had committed would be considered closest to such ""sincerity"" and ""appropriateness."" Today's general atmosphere in Germany toward the WW2 is self-reflection. On the other hand, the general atmosphere in Japan seems to be ignorance, as their history textbooks prove. (This is why I tend to differentiate between ""Germany"" and ""Nazi"" but not between ""Japan"" and the ""Imperial Japanese government"" in casual discussions.)  - Although no countries are innocent, that doesn't mean that we should stop shedding light on the Japanese atrocities, such as this movie. Rather, we should shed more light, but not on just one war or one country. Meanwhile, I think we should shed more and more light on the Japanese atrocities because people worldwide, especially in Europe and America, are too unaware of these, compared to their awareness of Nazi Germany. I find this very ironic and unfortunate because what Japan had done is no less, perhaps worse, than what the Nazis had done. Japan often may seem to be ""nicer"" compared to the Nazis because they didn't target on single race to cleanse. Although the concept of ""race cleansing"" is horrible, I think what matters more here is ""what"" they did than ""whom"" they did to. If you can, spare 30 minutes of your day searching for such barbarity, such as live human dissections (including pregnant women and their babies), rape, massacre, and that smile in the faces of the soldiers, each holding a head that he cut off from an innocent civilian. Then, you will understand that there are hundreds of more ""true stories"" just waiting to be told, that need to told, not only for those who've been innocently killed and their loved ones taken away but also for our future generations.  - I've seen some people (even here) denying the Japanese atrocities in Korea, saying that Koreans were ""accepted"" as ""their people,"" that the same laws applied, and that Korean men fought against Americans for Japan. All of these arguments are either false or meaningless however. The truth is that Koreans were oppressed in all possible ways. One of the most vicious and inhumane acts committed by the Japanese was erasing the Korean identity. Koreans were forced to change their names into Japanese; whoever spoke Korean, including boys and girls, were beaten; books in Korean were burned; history was erased; buildings and other cultural and historical monuments were torn down, etc. Although such cultural violence is not the first in human history, that does not make the Japanese atrocity any less evil. True acceptance comes from accepting the others' own distinct identity, whether that be individual or group identity. Moreover, beside from all the horrendous oppressions, the fact that the Japanese took the country away by force was the greatest violence to the Koreans. The entire nation had constantly fought for independence during the colonial period. No matter how ""accepting"" or ""nice"" the Japanese were, a forceful colonization itself was an atrocity.

I am American, and guess what, I know my country has made mistakes, but you want to know something else? Every country has. Every person has. Don't let the actions of a few corrupt soldiers shape your views of an entire country. Don't take such an inspirational movie like this and ruin it by turning it into something it's not. I read this book, and it was amazing. They wanted to keep it PG-13, so you won't even know some of the crap he went through unless you read the book. Now let's all grow up and stop insulting other countries. With your insults, you are accomplishing nothing except for making your own country look arrogant and stupid.

After he is tortured and released from the P.O.W., he thinks about vengeance and wanting to kill the man who tortured him for everything he put him through.  Then finds faith in God and believes in forgiveness.  He wants to find the soldier that tortured him and show him love, compassion, and mercy...even though most people in society would say otherwise and do the opposite.  He goes to look for him after the war and discovers that the Japanese soldier who had tortured him, killed himself because he was in such shame of what he did to people during the war.    So while people want to continue arguing and bickering, just consider what he did and that love is the answer to everything.  Not this constant hate of what humanity is known for, but for going above and beyond.",0,0,Logan Davis,XrjJbl7kRrI,0.04722222222222223,2014-12-20 08:28:01,False,True

This is a movie made for children to watch to overcome obstacles. Should have been produced by Disney. No dialogue. She needs to take notes from Ron Howard and Clint Eastwood as she attempted to bring a script (missing a lot) into the light. It's portrayed like a documentary without any dates. It would have been nice to see a timeline of dates on the screen. What town was he raised and year? What year were the Olympics he was in? Didn't mention Hitler was a fan of his and he even shook his hand. (as it would make movie goers ponder how in 1936 Berlin hosted the Olympics, while they invaded the majority of European countries and Japan were set to do it in 1940 for a nice correlation of events and he was captured literally just before the bombing of Pearl Harbor to start WWII) It failed to mention he spent 45 days at sea, the screen only showed 28 days. Just disappointed. It alluded a lot of reference to God and his religious faith, but failed to mention that because of his turning to Christ while at Sea, he endured the next 2 years of POW camps because of his faith in the Lord and later became one of the most well respected and known evangelist's in America. Seems like on the editing room floor everyone just said ""Yup, thats a great idea"" huff. Waiting on American Sniper Jan 16th.

Yes, after Dunkirk; after the fall of France; after the horrible episode of Oran; after the threat of invasion, when, apart from the Air and the Navy, we were an almost unarmed people; after the deadly struggle of the U-boat war—the first Battle of the Atlantic, gained by a hand's-breath; after seventeen months of lonely fighting and nineteen months of my responsibility in dire stress. We had won the war. England would live; Britain would live; the Commonwealth of Nations and the Empire would live.  How long the war would last or in what fashion it would end no man could tell, nor did I at this moment care. Once again in our long Island history we should emerge, however mauled or mutilated, safe and victorious. We should not be wiped out. We should not be wiped out. Our history would not come to an end. We might not even have to die as individuals. Hitler's fate was sealed. Mussolini's fate was sealed.

During the seven year occupation from 1945 until 1952, the Americans restructured the Japanese government and gave Japan the footing after its post WWII demise. The Occupation provided the groundwork from which one of the strongest nations of the 20th century emerged by laying the foundation for democracy and successful capitalism. On a ideological level, the American occupation was intended to instill democratic values and eradicate imperialist ways. On a practical level, the American occupation was intended to disarm the military, break up the zaibatsu businesses, reform the educational system, give power to the local level, and give women suffrage""   Europe>>>>> ""The Marshall Plan (officially the European Recovery Program, ERP) was the American initiative to aid Europe, in which the United States gave $17 billion (approximately $160 billion in current dollar value) in economic support to help rebuild European economies after the end of World War II. The plan was in operation for four years beginning in April 1948. The goals of the United States were to rebuild war-devastated regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, and make Europe prosperous again.[1]""   And guess who was one of those countries, GERMANY. Yes, GERMANY. And fyi, this plan was EXTREMELY successful, helping many countries get back on their feet!   America, most of the time, is there, ready to help a lending hand, to come in and stop the war, and America is ready to make peace with other countries OR help other countries make peace with each other.    AND YES, THE UNITED STATES did warn  residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to get out in case of impending air raids.   ""Before the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, the city was given the standard psychological warfare treatment prior to an ordinary incendiary attack. Leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima, indicating, along several other cities, that they were to be fire bombed within a few days and to evacuate the city. The leaflets are on display in the Peace Museum in Hiroshima and were dropped on the city several days prior to the atomic bombing. Unfortunately, most Japanese, even if they had read the leaflet, ignored the warning. Japanese citizens were instructed to turn such leaflets into their local police station.""   UNLIKE JAPAN WHO DID NOT warn the US about the Pearl Harbor attack, and even worse, the US was not in the WAR!!

2014-12-30T09:33:29,"The most important question in life is, “Am I good enough to go to Heaven?” To answer this, first you must consider what God is like. The Bible says God is Holy, just, perfect, all knowing, all powerful, full of grace and mercy; but “will not allow the wicked to go unpunished.” (Isaiah 6:3, Exodus 34:5-7). To see how you stand with God, compare yourself to His standard, the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20). Have you obeyed them? Here are just a few to check: ""You shall have no other gods before Me."" Jesus said, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.” (Mark 12:30). Have you always put God first? If not, then you have broken this commandment. ""You shall not make for yourself any graven image."" You are not to make any idols and worship them instead of God. This can be a statue, self, money, family, or an incorrect concept of God. The Bible warns that idolaters will NOT enter Heaven (Ephesians 5:5). ""You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain."" Have you ever used God’s Name as a curse word? If so, then you’re a blasphemer. God promises to hold those accountable who take His Name in vain. (Deuteronomy 5:11). ""You shall not murder."" Jesus said if you hate your brother; then you’ve murdered him in your heart (Matthew 5:22). If you’ve done this, you’re a murderer and will not inherit eternal life. (1 John 3:15). ""You shall not commit adultery."" Jesus said, “whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart” (Matthew 5:28). The Bible states, “fornicators and adulterers God will judge” (Hebrews 13:4). If you’ve lusted after someone you're not married to, or had sex outside of marriage, you’re an adulterer under God’s judgment. ""You shall not steal."" Regardless of value, theft is taking anything that doesn't belong to you. The Bible says, “let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor” (Ephesians 4:28). Theft includes refusing to pay debts, downloading illegal software or music, or ripping people off. Thieves will NOT enter eternal life. (1 Corinthians 6:10). ""You shall not bear false witness."" God states that lying is an abomination (Proverbs 6:17) and “and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire” (Revelation 21:8). If you tell even ONE lie, then you are a LIAR in God’s eyes. All have sinned, and the Bible says, ""For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all” (James 2:10). When we compare ourselves to God's Law, we can see that we are idolaters, blasphemers, liars, murderers, adulterers, and thieves at heart. If we're honest, we would admit that we have broken ALL of these commandments, numerous times. A Terrifying Truth The most TERRIFYING truth in the Bible is this... God is GOOD. Why is that terrifying? God is good, and we are not. Where does that leave us? Justice must be done. Imagine being guilty in court and saying to the judge, ""I’m guilty but I believe you’re a good man and you will overlook my crimes,"" the judge would respond, ""You’re right, I am a good man; and because of my goodness I’m going to see that justice is done."" If God is good, He MUST punish sinners. Any sin is an infinite offence against a Holy God. God’s just punishment is called Hell (eternal flames and darkness - Mark 9:48, Matt 8:12). Because you have a conscience, every time you sinned it was with knowledge it was wrong, and this condemns you (Romans 2:15). Here is the great dilemma; the Bible says that it is evil to justify the wicked (Proverbs 17:15), so how can a Holy God justify sinners without violating justice and being evil Himself? Guilty as Charged Imagine yourself in a courtroom as a criminal, guilty of serious crimes. You are tried, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison, or a fine of a million dollars. As the guard leads you away, the judge himself then steps down and pays your fine in full. You're free to go! Though you are guilty of the crimes, your fine has been paid! Justice has been satisfied, and the judge showed himself to be both merciful AND just. That's what God did for us 2,000 years ago. God took on flesh in the person of Jesus Christ; who lived the sinless life that you could not. Then, because of His love, offered Himself on the cross, bearing the full wrath of God for our sin. Then on the third day, He rose from the dead and showed the penalty for sin being fully paid. You’re guilty, but Jesus paid the fine. The Bible says, ""Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us” (Galatians 3:13). “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). So what should you do? God commands you to repent and put your trust in Jesus Christ ALONE for the forgiveness of sins. Abandon the thinking that your “good works” will help you on Judgment Day. The Bible says that our good works are like “filthy rags” before God. (Isaiah 64:6) They DO NOT make up for sin. Approach God like this: Imagine a woman who has committed adultery on her husband. Does her husband want a scripted apology? Of course not. Instead, her apology should be with utmost humility, sincerity, and she should determine to never even think of committing adultery again. So cry out to God; humbly asking for mercy, confessing and forsaking your sins. Read Psalm 51 to see how King David prayed to God when he sinned. The Bible says “But on this one will I look: On him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, And who trembles at My word.” (Isaiah 66:2) You Must Be Born Again Jesus said, “you must be born again” (John 3:7). Those that repent and trust in Jesus will be born again spiritually. God will give you a new heart with new desires. The Holy Spirit will dwell in your heart and you will desire the things that please God. You'll want to grow in holiness and your knowledge of God through reading the Bible. You'll also have a desire to tell others about Jesus. Read your Bible daily and obey it. Find a Bible-preaching church, and fellowship with other believers.",0,0,Levy Bongbonga,XrjJbl7kRrI,0.03737181337181336,2014-12-30 09:33:29,False,True

Unbroken played to a packed theater, I saw men on the edge of their seats and women recoiling in theirs, Unbroken relied less on narrative but allowed the movie to draw you in and captivate your attention through imagery, acting and engaging story telling; wisely Jolie refrained from Hollywood embellishments of a story that needed none. Wisely as well, the movie did not cover the segment after the war, to have done so in such limited time would have weakened and diluted the epic beginning, after the war should be a sequel and epic on its own. Miyavi as Watanabe nailed it and gave a chilly psychological performance with a tinge of Hannibal Lecter as an intellectual upper-class baby-faced monster, Jack as Zamperini should be nominated, he is flawlessly playing 3 different characters in one movie. Unbroken deserves a sequel (after the war) to be produced and optioned by Brad's Plan B, only than true realism and horror can be explored as in ""12YAS""; we will never get the real greatness of this epic story with a Hollywood studio fronting it.with a rated pg.

First of all the Japanese part of ww II was largely put in motion by the invasion of Chinese territory,  this tells us that they in fact started the war. They later conducted attacks on other countrys including the Philippines,  korea more attacks on china and etc. They also attacked major american army based situated in other country's.  The american retaliation only really started after the bombing of pearl harbour. On the topic of war crimes, though the American nuclear bomb were a very violent  approach to the  situation the Japanese had at the time enslave d and imprisoned hundreds of thousands of people, which as depicted in the book that I have In fact read lived in inhumane and more then cruel condition. They were starved and beaten which sometime lead to death. The Japanese also killed a large number of there prisoner which I remember to be around a 1/4 of all there prisoner and actually planed on killing every single one of them, but stopped by the American victory. to really comprehend  how bad a prisoner's life was read the book I can assure you, you will be bewildered to say the least. Its also truly surprising how many of them got away with it. My point beign most people including me gave little importance to the cruelty the Japanese exerted on the american POW, even if its on the same level as the holocaust but in smaller numbers. Other acts of cruelty committed by the Japanese in the prison inluded testing dangerous ""things"" on prisoners, mass execution, starvation, forced labour in extremely dangerous condition, severe beating/torture, stripping prisoners of all dignity and respect which would have severe impacts on the life of soldiers after they were liberated I honestly dont know what else they could have done to worsen the conditions.

2015-01-15T15:15:52,"This comment section is a trainwreck. Here are some actual interesting things about this movie: - Holy shit is that Jack O'Connel from Skins with black hair and an american accent? Cause that's pretty amazing. Glad to see he's doing well after the show ended. - Americans committed a large number of war crimes which, had the Allies lost, would have been condemned as such in a trial similar to that of Nuremberg. - The japanese, and the axis' forces as a whole, also committed a large number of war crimes, without a doubt more than the Allies, but not by a stretch. - Conclusion: War is awful and there are no victors in it. Nobody walks out of war with purity. All nations involved committed crimes against humanity, most soldiers involved committed acts of unrequired and unacceptable hatred, torture, violence and murder. It's not a pretty place, stop complaining about who'se the most evil, it's pointless. - The reason why people haven't made a big hollywood movie about how the allies were ALSO evil is because as a general rule people don't like to hear about their mistakes. That's how it is, there's no conspiracy there. If you want to make it yourself nobody is stopping you. Personally i'de love to see such a movie realized, and there are plenty of more indipendent movies of that sort already, not to mention some all time classics such as Platoon or Apocalypse Now which FULLY explain the horrors of war, the madness and violence of American troops and the mistakes they made.

Americans are always the 'good guys"" who always persevere in the face of ""evil"" whether it be the Russians, Japanese,Germans etc . Nevermind being critical of the failed policies and owning up to the suffering at the hands of this nation. No we can't have that now can we ? That would be an inconvenient truth and make us have to reexamine who we are and what we're doing . For many it's just best to stick their patriotic heads in the sand singing Yankee doodle dandy and that we can do no wrong .  Meanwhile they hide the bodies coming home so we're not distracted by the truth or question the wisdom of the leadership and these endless wars .Go ask an Iraqi , Afghan,Syrian, Egyptian, Libyan or others how they feel about Americans .Chances are that you'll get a bad opinion of this nation because of all the suffering and destruction we've brought upon them . Also if it weren't for great sacrifices by the Russians by the millions against Germany our history might be far different .Also their battles against Japan were what made them surrender and not the two atomic bombs .Had they not taken out a big chunk of the Japanese military we would have had to invade Japan . Ask an American who won the war and they'll ignorantly tell you that it was the great USA who won the second world war and the first . Nevermind the actual facts ,just keep brainwashing the people .",0,1,royalspin,XrjJbl7kRrI,0.05937500000000001,2017-12-11 18:49:48,False,False

Even if these descriptions are true, every country which involved World War 2 has done a lot of brutal treatments of prisoners.

Angelina Jolie wanted to create a movie where both sides were the victims, and what was in the past is in the past. Louis said it himself, forgiveness is better than revenge. Louis forgave The Bird, he forgave Japan and continued to run in Japan after the events. I think this world is missing humanity and forgiveness, if we continue to hold grudges there will only be more fighting and war; revenge will get us nowhere. I think that’s why I found this movie so inspiring, and I hope the rest of the world will eventually realize that same forgiveness as Louis.

2019-03-30T04:06:18,"I hate to say it, but this movie is painfully *mediocre.*    From the title and the credits, you know the character will likely remain strong through all the trials that stand before him. You know he persists through his training in the Olympics and through Japanese internment during the war. But each scene just gives us a demonstration of his mental toughness through these obstacles. The character never seems like he confronts a challenge we didn't already think he was going to persist through. I mean again, we know the film is titled *Unbroken* and what the two main challenges will be in his life. We'd likely expect he'd just triumph over both of them and that's that. The importance of the narrative is to break our expectations somehow still reach that cinematic end. In that regard, the movie feels like all it did was glorify the life of Louis Zamperini without delivering a truly good story.    I'd have proposed the following changes so that, hopefully, an audience is taken more by the edge of their seat: (1) Don't title the film *Unbroken* (it's too obvious and on-the-nose) (2) Demonstrate something our character fails at miserably and which is persistent through his life despite his efforts, see this manipulated by the Japanese, then see him triumph in the end (we will have witnessed him triumphing over something we very well thought he would fail at instead of seeing him basically play out like a superhero) (3) Give us more moments of him questioning himself so we, similarly, feel like he isn't just a superhero (I feel it is painfully obvious how much Angelina Jolie reveres Louis Zamperini for how sterilized the character depiction was).     With what was a very sterilized experience, even the incredible production feels completely ornamental and over-produced. The period texture is great, the acting is great, the directing is good...but all for a story that doesn't break any of our expectations from a glorification pic.",0,1,Eddie Avinashi,XrjJbl7kRrI,0.03185483870967743,2019-03-30 04:06:18,False,False
