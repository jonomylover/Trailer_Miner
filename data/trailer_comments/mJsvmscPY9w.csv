Bridget become a support to Mark in a difficult part in his life. He and his wife have in course of 5 years grow apart, fighting everyday to a part where they don¬¥t speak to each other anymore. He then meet Bridget that fiend out about the divorce and he end up pouring everything out to her. after the divorce they keep contact. Bridget fiend so out that her mom is ill. this time it is Mark turn to give her support. In course of this event they grow closer and fall i Love again.  In this Bridget is a more grown up woman that don¬¥t always do stupid thing. Her confident give Mark strengt to go on even if it`s hard for him.

It is light, funny, romantic and the name Darcy hints on what it is more about. It is about love and finally getting with the person you are meant to be with. It is a modern day Jane Austin story of love and tanglements. The actors are lovely and their characters are credible and sweet. My usual genre is crime so for me to enjoy something as light as this it has to be good. If you like these actors and feel like something romantic and light then you will enjoy this film. If you want to judge it by a criteria that it is not pretending to be then you will be disappointed. It entertains as a romance and comedy.
