To all of those people who think that the main character's actions are exaggerated, let me say that I had experienced the same pain of losing a dog to a criminal.  It was back in 2012 when some bastards robbed my home. They decided to poison my dog, and best friend who wasn't even half a metre tall and in the back yard. Back then I was in high school, things had gotten rough, and he would be the only one that I trusted to tell my worries to. At first I thought it was a cold because he whimpered slightly at first, and then into yelps on the second day. I could see that he was in pain, and unfortunately, he had to be put down. Which broke my heart, seeing that he suffered so much, adding to the fact that I wasn't there for him when he died because I was forced to go to school.  I am a really quiet person at school, everyone thinks that I'm all shy and distant. However, even 2 years on, I still do not forgive the person who did that to him. If I ever found out, I would gouge their eyes out slowly,then pour acid down his throat so he knew how my dog felt in his final days. I would seriously make them pay for the pain they had caused on my dog and I. However, I do not know who did it, and the police are useless at finding the criminal.

I could be watching Fury or something else instead."" Even the initial conflict that sparks everything else in the movie was kind of shallow and dumb, but boy, once the action started this movie won me over. It's just so cool. A lot of the action was very reminiscent of, say, John Woo Hong Kong action flicks with lots of gunplay. Keanu pulls off the stone cold badass pretty well. Some of his lines were a bit awkward, but overall good job. I actually don't remember him talking all that much in the movie, so that might have helped a bit. Michael Nyqvist was god damn fantastic. He was very likable for an antagonist. I would definitely watch this movie again. However, it's not for everyone.

A good actor can have flops just as easy as successes because of weak characters, bad plot or lousy script dialogue (got to have those good lines. The best Clint Eastwood type of line in the movie...when the priest says he can't open the vault because Viggo will kill him...and John Wick's reply...""uh huh""). A lot of dark scenes and too much gun play. This was like a Steven Seagal flick. Superman beats all opposition. Usually a boring story.  Interesting characters: puppy, Viggo, Marcus, Ms. Perkins (like Gina Carano in ""haywire"" or another female hit woman in ""four assassins""), hotel manager, and I think the other was Winston (where they surrounded Ms. Perkins and finished her).  A good movie needs more elements than good charisma, action, and some interesting characters. The plot was too straightforward. The intro to why Wick goes after Viggo's son is a weak plot intro. Like figure the odds of stealing a car from one of his father's former hitman associates. Could have been a better intro reason. The puppy was a good touch. They wasted the idea too soon though.  Wife has cancer...from movie with Charlize Theron. Sending the bouncer home was like something from a Chuck Norris flick. Killing the dog was ""shooter""...Mark Wahlberg...and a much better movie. The overall plot reminded me a lot of Jason Statham movies. The hero needs to know how to escape to safety like a commando (like the escape seen in ""the Transporter"" when the house is blown up and they go down a shaft into the ocean...not just gung ho every time.

If untrained, they Shit and piss all over your carpet and your Bed When they Piss they leave an enzyme with it which makes matters worse,  because they will continue pissing on the same spot and you need a special chemical to kill it they are sporadic, out of control and unpredictable, misbehaved if they don't get things their way You have to put several mats so they piss and shit in their designated area You have to take them outside everyday so that they can get used to shitting and pissing outside They bite and scratch your property especially your electrical cords if you're not around They constantly bark all Fucking night My Analysis and Conclusion.  John Wick would Kill the puppy first before he gets the opportunity to avenge it.

Now I understand they can go back and re-cut a movie, but if I buy a theatrical release then go to watch it two years later, I want to watch the SAME friggin movie!! If I want a ""Director's cut"", I'll buy it! Or at least give an option when starting the movie to choose which version to watch... this is pissing me off... anyone else noticed this?!?",0,0,Shibumi,2AUmvWm5ZDQ,0.022222222222222223,2020-05-29 15:35:43,False,False
