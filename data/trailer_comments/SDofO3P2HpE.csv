Why not have some new suspense and new obstacles rather than the same ones you've already read. 2) It would take way to long. They only have about two hours of film. They can't make a six hour book into a two hour movie. They have to close up the gaps somehow. 3) It's now original. It isn't a carbon copy of the book, it's unique. And I prefer it that way.

There was around the whole group who left Gally obviously left the building if they were the only ones in said building. I have Maze Runner book 10/10 and Scorch Trails book 10/10 I have the MR movie 5.5/10 for not following the plot well established in the book and just based on this trailer I give this movie a .5/10 for definitely not following the plot in the book.

But you can't transform it into a movie. I love how they did  the movie now. It is filled with action and it will be entertaining.  you can't do the telepathy thing in a movie. it would be cheesy to watch and quite awkward to see the actors just standing there doing nothing but looking serious while we hear their voices. also there are a lot of weapons involved which in the book are rarely. But I like it because it makes the fights more interesting.  The book is interesting because we can read what Thomas thinks in different situations which makes it so entertaining. Like...imagine them going through that dark tunnel on their way into the scorch. how boring would it be to see that in a film?? and like...just that looooooong way into the city on which noone says a word and we read just about Thomas's thoughts?  like really people need to calm down and understand that it is nearly impossible to make a movie in which everything is like the book.

2015-09-24T21:35:24,"Just saw it for my Birthday , this was .. interesting.. for a fan of the book. While I still LOVED the movie, the fact that it was SO different from the book, it completely took me out of the movie & the story, because I was waiting for scenes that never happened.. I was like ""OH YEAH NOW THERE ARE GOING TO BE THESE METAL BALLS THAT CUT YOUR HEAD OFF"", I was waiting for that scene the entire movie and it wasn't there, which was a bit dissapointing to say the least.  But my biggest problem was that they switched the entire purpose of the Maze.  There were supposed to be just 2 groups ; Group A & Group B. In each group there was supposed to be all guys with 1 girl (Teresa) and all girls with 1 guy (the boy we are introduced to in this movie) and in the middle of the book, that boy betrays Thomas along with Teresa and it's so awfull you just want to punch her. This is so different in the movie that it just took me out of it, now people who have not read the book are going to have a completely different experience with this. As a movie itself, it's great and probably am gonna see it again, but as a fan of the books, it's a bit ""off"" for me. The first one took some things out and I was fine with it, but this one took it a little too far for me. They changed characters too much with only their name as the original thing that was left. However in time, I will forget these changes and just see this as an ""alternate reality""; I like to think of these movies as a giant ""WHAT IF"" scenario. The books are still great and are STILL there for everyone to enjoy, and these movies are ALSO very good and are ALSO awesome to enjoy.

The cast blew me away, and everyone suited their roles really well.  Thing is, I feel like book readers will almost NEVER be satisfied when theres a movie adaption made. But for a film to be this successful, for a film that started off with little resources and funding, and for a film that actually hit no. 1 in box office, I think you should cut them some slack. Like movies will never be 100% or sometimes even 50% close to the book, but if they actually make it big, and it becomes a hit, I don't think it's right to call it the ""worst film ever"" just because you're constantly comparing it to the book.",882,42,au3reyoo,SDofO3P2HpE,0.0883241758241758,2016-04-03 21:09:21,False,False

2020-04-24T20:39:59,Just finished watching it!  It was AMAZING!  In my opinion better then the first one. It was intese and full of action. My kind of movie. I was freaking out almost the entire time. Although like i said i find this one better than the previous one but I must say first book is definitely better then the second book that's why i loved almost all the changes they did here. Bravo to all especially to Dylan. In my opinion he's perfect as Thomas. üòä,1,1,Sandra Mijailovic,SDofO3P2HpE,0.35555555555555557,2020-04-24 20:39:59,False,False
