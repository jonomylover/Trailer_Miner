2014-08-11T23:30:52,"Wow.  A great actor.  You never know when you will have to leave the earth, so make every moment count.  And his work speaks volumes. ... Choices.. Doubt.  That said, interesting movie, or trailer rather.  It suggests that this is the logical consequence of dehumanizing, a segment of the population, to be ignored, or used (as in, all I see here is land and the economic resources to be found therein). The logical consequence of USURY (looking upon others as a resource), is extermination of the useless, or vengeance, fighting back, war... It is a wonder how the voices of many are neglected, from workers, who spend their lives without a single day of vacation, in ""invisible"" toil, away from them who partake of the fruits of that toil, to ""Reservations"" or ""ghettos"" (in truth, concentration camps)... All this, a direct result of USURY... Eugenics, seeks to establish a group, whose members may be useful, or not, but whose genetic profile marks them as a ""master race""... Hence, I think is the reason that the movie's setting, is Germany, post-War.  And so, they seek to destroy through a campaign of demonization, and violation - males who do not ""fit the profile"", until ""peace"" is achieved (""genetic perfection"", and a political economy that can be described as a ""caste system"").. Well, that is a theory...  Atmosphere : The way this movie looks and sounds, ... the abductors, torturers, human rights abusers, they who work for ""them"", seem confused, ambivalent... stuck, in their roles... ""It's the system""... ""It's life""... They do not attempt to fight back ... anymore, but have accepted, the status quo... Or so it would seem... Very, Orwellian... as in that book, by Orwell, 1984.  Is TRUTH enough to free you?  And not rather a ""starting point""? Jesus said, And if ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed.  And ye shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall MAKE you free.  So, takes a while... Tick...
