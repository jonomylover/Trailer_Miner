People getting all upset and saying that Hollywood is trying to make light of the war in Afghanistan, the story is all about Barkers REAL experience. It's not going to be all comedy, there will be drama in this too. The comedy will come from real places. The movie is not about Afghanistan per se, it is about a journalists experience while she's over there.   Also, don't be so touchy about the 'over here, you're a 9, borderline 10' thing, it's not saying Afghan women are unattractive (the one main Afghan lady we see is beautiful), it's more about the environment with all the journalists together, the first thing Margot Robbie says is 'it's so nice to have another woman in the house', implying that most of the journalists there are men who have had almost no women around them, that's why Tina Fey will be considered to be more attractive there than in America where they would have more choice.

This is a story about the foreign journalists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and in the book the story is narrated by Kim Barker (and is therefore not objective). When she first arrives in Kabul, she is VERY american. Her story is about learning to understand the culture and situation of the afghan conflict and people, set in ""Kabul High"", her name for the community of foreign journalists, since it reminds her of high school. Since the world was focusing on the war in Iraq in the early 2000s, the journalists in Afghanistan were few and slightly bored. At the same time, they risked their lives on an everyday basis, which obiously comes with psychological consequences.  I guess that the big difference between the book and the movie will be how graphic it is - the book is rather direct and short, and focuses on describing the political game in Afghanistan. Parties at kabul high are not often described in detail, while this trailer obviously gives a more grahic view of this part of the story.",5,0,kivi,dxAcIWDi8ps,-0.005217391304347826,2016-02-08 10:51:33,True,True
