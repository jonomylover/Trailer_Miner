Just take off the rose-tinted glasses while  of you are nostalgic about that Fraser trilogy. Or need I remind you all that the second and especially the third movie SUCKED ASS? People have short-term memory, I guess. Still, there is no excuse to be as ignorant as all of you folks are about this in the year 2016. Google, Yahoo, Bing - USE IT. They literally spam articles about this movie and the planned monster universe.

And really, it feels more like The Mummy: Apocalypse without the mutants than anything else.  This is a huge problem with Hollywood right now, in my opinion. They have an template of what they think works. And while that template does work sometimes, they take that and try to force every other film into that box. The majority of action-adventure movies are feeling like carbon-copies of each other with swapped details rather than unique stories.   And stop it with the overuse of bad cgi!! It really takes away from the immersion! A little bit of bad cgi is fine, but when a movie relies on it to do the big sfx, then it's a problem, and the movie feels more like cartoon than a live-action flick. Not every movie has to try to copy Marvel.   Goddammit, they just couldn't leave this franchise alone. They can't leave any franchise alone. Any franchise which even has the smallest bit of success and notoriety will be ruined. And The Mummy wasn't even that successful or good. It's almost cult following status, I feel.

2016-12-05T11:15:46,I understand if you don't like remakes but stop with the Brendan Frasier comments not only was his version of the mummy a REMAKE the last film in the series was nearly a decade ago and the first film was almost two decades ago. In addition this is the first film in a cinematic universe of classic monster movies similar to marvel or dc they already have many more remakes planned. I also feel changing the mummy's gender was more of a creative decision rather than an act of feminism because we already have two original male mummy's in addition to the two in the Brendan Frasier series. It allows them to take a different approach to the mummy as a character. Also the Brendan Frasier series was set in the 20s or 30s in Egypt so I'm sure there will be a whole lot of new things in modern day in addition to changing locations,1,0,maintaco1,IjHgzkQM2Sg,0.21989633173843698,2016-12-05 11:15:46,True,True

It's so tiring to watch generic film after unnecessary sequel after unnecessary overly cgi-ed reboot after bastardized childhood nostalgia movie adaptation. Just get with the original shit or find a way to divert money to the indie scene where at least some of it is still original. Some, I say with utmost care,  because even indie films have gotten a bit contrived and bullshitty. I'm not saying every film has to be a winner, but like... Why are so many Hollywood films these days not even as good as 70s/80s/90s B movies?

2016-12-05T15:38:34,"I actually wrote a story similar to this. In it, this wealthy, fat museum guy who can summon demons using mystical items/artifacts, funds an expedition to the tomb of the Lost Queen of Egypt. He does this because the ancient Queen was a skilled enchantress who had obtained true immortality and whose destructive power exceeded that of an army. For some mysterious reason, four of the most powerful sorcerers in Egypt had sealed her within the coffin. Basically, he wants to learn the secret to immortality.   So, some of the people he sends are people who actually want to learn and a few are sent who know what the real purpose of this mission is. When the group  brings the coffin across the chasm to where they are standing, deep underground, an earthquake sound appears and the black five-headed dragon Gora appears and starts butchering up and frying everyone with flames. Very few people are able to get to the surface and much fewer can get on an airplane out of there. The, I think, five individuals who know the secret mission keep the coffin on their plane and try to head to the museum. But, the enormous dragon relentlessly pursues them in the sky.  Then, one of the people on the plane use a mystical item, the Eye of Ra, a golden triangular artifact with an eye at its center, to send the dragon to another dimension. However, this requires one sacrifice so one of the guys on the plane gets sucked up into the Eye of Ra. So now, there are four guys on the plane and three of them complain that they shouldn't have done that. But, the guy who used the item argues that they couldn't get rid of the dragon any other way and that besides, the boss promised them a huge reward, and if there are fewer people to share it among, then everyone gets more.   So, these four guys reach the museum at night where the crazy fat guy is waiting. While the people were on an expedition, he had made preparations summoning one hundred druid demons with one really big death-reaper like demon called Death Keeper (I think?). He has the coffin brought in and he examines the hieroglyphs which indicate that it takes four human sacrifices to unlock the Queen. When the four guys ask for the money, he gives a crazy laugh and betrays them by using the Eye of Ra to sacrifice all four of them. So, the Immortal Queen appears.  She awakens and the fat guy tells her where she is and what he wants. She tells him that she doesn't really know about the whole immortality thing. So, he has the Death Keeper strike a chain into her soul to pull it out and she falls forward. But, when he tells her that this is the power of one hundred human souls, she's not impressed. Then, she generates the power of more than one hundred souls, pulls out a sword by magic and shatters the chain causing all the demons to disappear into smoke and her sword disappears too. Despite being a modern sorcerer, he greatly underestimated the Immortal Queen's magic and she gives him amnesia. Then, she leaves, curious to learn about this new world she had arrived in.   And that's as far as I got in writing the story.",0,0,Azmain Nisak,IjHgzkQM2Sg,0.09854882154882157,2016-12-05 15:38:34,True,True

2016-12-05T18:28:54,"This reboot just confuses tf out of me. They pick Tom Cruise for it, and he's *older* than Brendan Fraser. The guy is 54(but doesn't look as such. What is with some of these actors looking like they never age?). Usually with these reboots/remakes, actors that are younger than the previous ones, are picked. Not older ones. And what's funny, is that when I look at this movie, I see The Mummy. It looks more like a sequel that you'd expect(mainly when it comes to visuals) if it was made nowadays, a sequel that could've happened, but was stuck in developmental hell, and had changes, one of which, Brendan Fraser being replaced by Tom Cruise. This reboot is just right on that line, between a reboot/remake being good, or complete, unrecognizable garbage. At best, I see this film being average or slightly below average.  There's one positive thing though. For once, in a modern film with Egyptian stuff in it, the Egyptian part *isn't* white-washed. I checked, the actress, Sofia Boutella, isn't white. She's Algerian-French. Algeria is in North Africa. They actually got someone from Africa in someway, for an Egyptian role. Props to Universal. Don't know why they this Mummy looking more like The Enchantress though.  But Universal are the same ones behind The Great Wall, and the main protagonist in that film, is played by a White actor, instead of an Asian actor, so WTF is going there? Then again, that film is coming out in China this month, so maybe Universal learned what all of these studios should've gotten through their heads by now.",5,4,TheGameKeeper94,IjHgzkQM2Sg,0.100988455988456,2016-12-05 18:28:54,True,True

That being said, as much as I love those classic films, I also understand that it's foolish to expect these reboot movies to be anything like those vintage flicks. I'm very excited to see how the casting for this incarnation of ""The Mummy"" has been so thoughtfully done. Tom Cruise is an excellent actor, highly effective in all of his roles, and he should really bring amazing things to this project. Russell Crow is wonderful beyond words, and will surely lean a real gravitas to his part.   However, the casting of Sofia Boutella promises to be the biggest thrill to be found here, and her creature design (from what little I've been able to see thus far) appears quite extraordinary, and could easily fall into the realm of iconic in its own right.

You know, sometimes sticking to the rout of one of the older movies isn't such a bad thing. Doing something different is all fine and cool... But this is so different i just don't know that i know what this is anymore. Now it's some kinda female demonic bitch with superpowers buried in something that doesn't really look egyptian... This does not look like anything Mummy esk at all. The thing i loved so much about the 1999 movie is that it fealt like a fucking dventure back in the old days. Shit looked egyptian. It looked kinda scary and exiting... When ever i watch those movies i just get goosebumps because it's so exiting and great. + The actual Mummy design is like scary as fuck when you think about it. And he has his Mummy soldiers that are actually rather creepy... And he slowly becomes more and more human.... Sorta expanding on the concept of the original where he just all of a sudden is human and no one expects him to be a actual Mummy. The 199 version is my favorite. Here... The Epyptian style is just raped to the point where it isn't egyptian. The Mummy doesn't look like a Mummy... They seem to just be playing on SEX as per usual. ''Oh look, a sexy woman with superpowers and she is bad''. I'm actually expeecting a scene where she tries to seduce someone with being all like ''Look at my titts, look at my ass... Grab me, fuck me and DIE''. That's not The Mummy... I actually hoped that they would manage to do something great. I was hoping for a return to form.... Back to the horror roots. But instead they made this generic pice of garbage.... Had it not had the MUMMY name on there it wouldn't botter me at all. But this uses the name of a OLD OLD series of movies that is well respected and loved by many and it totally butchers it... Sorry, this is a shit trailer. The movie looks shit and i won't be checking it out until i can get it on like a 3 Blu-rays for the price of one. No thank you Universal... Go back to the drwaing bord. Rename this shit and give me a real Mummy movie. And the fact that you plan to build a Universe around this makes me even more sad....

2016-12-05T23:26:16,"I'm not too big a fan of this at the moment. An article I read said this was a form of reboot of The Mummy movies I grew up watching. This isn't a reboot, it's an entirely different movie. Which is fine, to be perfectly honest. I forget which article it was I read (I didn't pay attention in that respect). But I think they're confused though.   As far as the trailer goes: A.) That scream ""AHHH! AHHH!...........AHHHHH!"" I love it so much; too hilarious! But... B.) They need to hire a better film editor because holy shit this trailer looked so bad compared to others I've seen ""recently"" (I.E.: Not very recent, actually).  - I liked the trailer for The Force Awakens a lot. Before the movie came out I was only recently introduced to the Star Wars movie series. Even with that very little attachment/exposure to the series the Episode 7 trailer got me crying. LOL... But that's just my opinion and should not be taken too seriously. Let's be honest here, I'm no movie critic. The movie could be a huge hit and the trailer isn't portraying it that masterfully. I just like what I like and dislike what I dislike. That's all there is to it. xD  What do you guys think of the trailer/movie? Was the trailer done well to you, or was there a past movie trailer you watched that you liked far better?",1,0,Krissy Marie,IjHgzkQM2Sg,0.1882440476190476,2016-12-05 23:26:16,True,True

Let's not discuss the fact that this actress was only selected from Algeria as a lazy way to insult the intelligence of anyone who would complain that she's pale and white, so they can say she's African. She's not African. Today's Egyptians and Northern Africans aren't anywhere fucking close to the original Egyptians. The Nubians are the original Egyptians and they were the ones who built and first ruled Egypt...and they're actually still there till today. AND their pyramids predate Ancient Egypt. How are you trying to whitewash people that still exist???  Saying that this isn't whitewashing because the actress is from Africa is like saying having Johnny Depp play Tonto isn't whitewashing because Depp lives in America. That's fucking stupid.  Let me guess...you're going to have the servants and slaves being blacks, and then whites being the leaders?  Dear white people...you played no role in Ancient History. When the world was being created...you were hiding in Europe. Ancient ROmans didn't identify as White and they actually raided and captured and sold whites in their slave trade. FACTS!  Ancient Greeks and ROmans also thought being darkskinned was a gateway to being brilliant, creative, divine, spiritual, wise, and artistic...go read all of the things they wrote about blacks.

To me they'll always be the perfect B+ movies. While I don't think this movie will be bad just because it's a remake, I do hope they keep some of the weirdness. Giant sand faces, beetles crawling under people's skin and eating their brains, giant, poorly CGI'd man-scorpions, that's the kind of stuff that gave those movies their identity. Hell even the Tomb of the Dragon emperor had it with Jet Li constantly puking up clay over himself and getting refrozen and shit. Also I'm not sure about the whole ""epicness"" this movie is setting up. Yeah the originals had pretty high stakes involved each time, but it was usually people fighting out in the desserts and dark tombs, not entire cities being wiped out. Makes it seem less like a daring adventure and more like a disaster movie.",1,0,pdragon619,IjHgzkQM2Sg,0.06560606060606063,2016-12-06 09:20:44,True,True

This is ""THE"" True Mummy that can put fear in the hearts of men and display Godlike Egyptian power. An Horror and action icon. This IS NOT based on action adventure with Brendan Fraser.

I LOVE his independence (not many people obtain that in Hollywood), but to have this quality of producer and director under Universal opposite Mr. Crowe is about as good as Hollywood gets. If this is his biggest effort yet, at 53 that says something.  It speaks VOLUMES that a man his age was picked for such a major action movie to be released just as the summer holidays begin.  One would certainly think a younger man would have been chosen.  He can't get enough KUDOS for being the action hero of a ""fingers-crossed"" blockbuster at age FIFTY THREE!!!! Yes, some older guys limp painfully through endless franchise sequels, but just from the trailer, you can see he is in peak form and HE LOOKS VIBRANT. I've heard not only is he more daring than many younger men but also he plays it safe and has a life-time knowledge of stunts which is something the young bucks don't have.  And he is once again in a movie with STRONG FEMALE LEADS because he actively promotes women in movies.  AND, he speaks up for mental patients who often exist in deplorable conditions in asylums.

On top of that, this teaser has ""serious"" and ""action flick"" written all over it in blatantly cliched lettering.  The Mummy (1999) was more of a macabre comedy than anything else. It barely took itself seriously, and it was a smashingly good cinema. Practically timeless in its entertainment value.  But the casting and framing in this Trailer says it all: Mission Impossible VII: Project Divine Tom Cruise Imitates Jesus-Keanu Reeves Role and Saves the Planet from an Ancient Pseudo-Sexy Egyptian Evil in Order to Save a Romantic Interest.  In other words, it's total cut and paste. New logo on the same tired old product. Just another lazy as beans money grubbing institutionalized cinema production.  Think I'm pouring salt on this?

There's nothing horrifying or spooky about the mummification ritual performed to Kemetic Pharaohs  before the afterlife. Of course most Africans in the states have no idea of there own ancient ancestral culture staring them right in the face. So companies like Universal can produce movies where the theme is Kemetic, (Egyptian) and never receive opposition from the descendants of who the culture truly belongs to. When one group robs another of there history, and culture this is what happens. There able to change it, and frame the narrative to whatever is fitting towards there liking. On the other hand this is Cruise so his name brings millions of viewers to the Box Office. These comment will be overlooked for the sake of entertainment by those who enjoy this stuff, and the mockery, and disrespect towards another ancient cultural group will continue.

My question is and please forgive because I didn't read all the comments...what the heck is Dr. Jekyll doing here with the mummy and who is Cruise suppose to really be. I know some say it's a revival of the Mummy movie series, others say it a reboot of Universal Monster movies. To me it looks like a big screen version of Penny Dreadful (Showtime series, now off the air). Could Cruise's character be for instance (I say this because he looks immortal or at least is hard to hurt).....Dorian Grey perhaps or the monster maybe (I have seen many many Frankenstein versions and he not always...what is considered to be ugly..I have a page called Classic HorrorMovies on FB....dealing not only with classic horror but all movies from the silent era to the 1980s...sometimes I go to the 90s/2000s but that is a rarity. I don't claim to know everything about horror movies or movies in general but I love watching them and  researching them)...or even.....just go with it or try....Ramses (you know like the character sort of like from Anne Rices novel...The Mummy, a good guy) or lets go with Imhotep. Well that's my opinion anyway...oh as for the Rick O'Connell series...too bad Rachel Weisz thought she was too old to play a mother of a grown child, not that I am knocking Maria Bello.

September 23rd 2017 , this is what the Bible calls the great sign in heaven. the woman clothed in the Sun the moon at her feet and a crown of the Stars above her head, this is the Revelation 12 sign in the Bible. many Christians believe this is the beginning of the tribulation on that date and possibly the rapture of True Believers in Jesus Christ who are practicing their faith. many believers in Jesus unfortunately maybe left behind or not living christ-like or merely being lukewarm in their faith. the mark of the beast is coming and so many Christians still Lac the understanding of what it is. your mark is like your signature it identifies you it is unique to you and is given to you by God , you were created in the image of God. it is your DNA , unlike anything else it is uniquely you. so what is the mark of the beast , it is changing your DNA into something else other then what is God's. just as it was in the days of Noah so it will be again with the returning of Christ. in the days of Noah the Fallen Angels we're corrupting mankind and the animals and the insects with their DNA changing them into something that was no longer a creation of God. and this is why God brought the flood of Noah and destroyed everything on Earth. we're even warned how they will bring this about , to save your life you will have to do something knowingly that changes your DNA like taking a government-mandated vaccine to protect you from a virus that would kill you. God's word says You must be willing to lose your life in order to save it eternally. RFID will play a role in this as your DNA is used as your signature or in a more legal sense your mark. you won't be able to buy or sell without it we already see this in our schools without the government mandatory vaccines children R Block from attending school. this is my opinion, by reading the Bible and considering historical and archaeological evidence.",1,0,Ken Bell,IjHgzkQM2Sg,0.17391304347826086,2017-05-20 17:30:40,True,True

Jake Johnson fits like a glove in that character. 3- I liked the jumpscares, the fact that this movie contains comedy and horror is just amazing I felt really good watching this movie. 4- That easter egg when Jenny was fighting the dude in the library and she smacked his face with the Book of Amun-Ra, that was brilliant. 5- Princess Ahmanet transforming the glass from the windows into a massive sandstorm was every bit brilliant, once glass is made from sand. And here this hoe did the complete opposite. 6- I liked the plot twist at the end. I'm honestly so tired of all those happy ending clich√©s, I end up standing on the bad guy's side every movie.  There are more aspects but i'm too lazy to describe..  Tom Cruise did a good job, he's always been a good actor. But I feel that they should've used a younger actor.

2020-05-29T17:18:35,Action Packed and monstrously bloody - This latest take on MUMMY series lacks the Authenticity and family feel of the old and loved Mummy series.Also the characters feels little half pitched and incomplete story line. The action sequences are really good especially the plane crash scene.The movie is very fast paced and that‚Äôs a good thing for this story. This movie marks the beginning of UNIVERSAL'S dark Universe cinematic universe and also its End.,0,0,VIKRANT KULKARNI,IjHgzkQM2Sg,0.12372222222222223,2020-05-29 17:18:35,False,False
