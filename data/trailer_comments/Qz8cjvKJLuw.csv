2017-03-08T17:45:17,"Warner Bros. Pictures, got an idea for an PG-rated 2D animated film for all of your hardcore WB fans out there that you, Warner Animation Group, Village Roadshow Pictures, Ratpac Entertainment and Stoopid Buddy Stoodios should do together in the future call Liz's Princess-tacular Adventurous Experience; An WB take of the hit Disney XD show, Star Vs. The Forces Of Evil about an adventure-loving teenager kingdom princess who got sent to Earth by her royal kingdom parents and befriends an Mexican-American kung fu-loving high school teenager and must protect the almighty family staff from an emperor and his army and her evil twin princess sister and her almighty evil army of princess titans as well so they can use it to take over not only Liz's home world and Earth, but also the entire universe. Also Liz falls in love with a chill-out and rock and roll-loving boy who not only lives in his cool car, but he also lives with his partying-loving twin brother. Everything needs to be an amazingly epic fun experience from the 2D animation, the cast and characters, fighting sequences, it's charm, it's theme music and so much more in order to make this animated film not only an animated gem, epic enjoyable, an uber-fun event unlike any other, an can't-miss adventurous thrill ride of fun movie event, amazingly entertaining to behold, an 10/10 can't miss animated experience and also an spectacularly charming event to date, but also the, if not, THE #1 most outstandingly uber-fun and amazingly entertaining Warner Animation Group movie event to date in both Warner Bros. history and animation history!  If this works out well, then you guys should make an solidly uber-enjoyable animated film franchise out of it that'll be not only equally as epic cool than the last in every way and also an amazing movie event of a lifetime, an unbelievable can't-miss animated gem, spectacularly cool from beginning to end, utterly awesome in every way imaginable, an absolute cool experience, phenomenal fun, god-forsaken spectacular in every way imaginable, pandemonium fun, flawlessly fun, the next absolute blast to date, an thrill ride of sheer coolness, 100% pure joy and 101% pure fun as well, outstandingly enjoyable, an animated epic, the next enjoyably worldwide phenomenon of the ages, an 10/10 total blast for all ages, surprisingly clever, an fun event unlike any other, an adventurously mind-blowing cool epic, knock-out fun, Lakewood Plaza Turbo levels of awesomely enjoyable fun from start to finish and also LEGO Batman Movie levels of laugh-out-loud enjoyable fun from start to finish, an epic adventurous fun fest for all ages, enjoyably charming, the next instant modern day animated classic for all ages, an epic fun animated must-see, the next can't-miss cult classic of a lifetime, amazingly cool beyond belief, a fantastical fun movie event in recent years and also the greatest film franchise of all time, but also the, if not, THE #1 most spectacularly greatest and most unbelievably excellent animated film franchise Warner Animation Group ever made to date. Liz will also have a romantic couple-type best friend relationship with one of her high school classmates, model after Barbara Gordon from the Batman franchise, who is equally as chaotic fun and adventurous as she does and fantastically hot in every way imaginable and only one of the beautifully amazing princess titans also have a girl crush on her later on in the franchise and decide to be on the good side because it's more fun over there than on the evil side. It'll get tons of awards both at the Annies and at the Oscars as well because it's phenomenally epic fun for all the right reasons and make some new box office records from time to time. The final entry of the series (in the far future) will also be so jaw-dropping amazing, it'll absolutely make people's minds explodes for all the right reasons, Respond if you guys like this epic fun idea.

They have cloned Nephilim giants & cross hybridized them with animals to create Lycans, Hellcats & Jeepers Creepers Reptilians. What do you get when you cross hybridize a dinosaur with a winged reptile ? A Dragon ! Since these Beasts are not God's creations guess who gets to possess them ? If you said Satan & his Demons you are correct. The elite are generational Satanist Vampires who abduct children, rape them, drink their blood & ritually sacrifice them to Satan.  Just because you haven't seen Satan doesn't mean he doesn't exist. The supernatural is very real & trillionaires/billionaires, politicians, music stars, artists, actors,¬†sports stars & many others channel the supernatural when they make Faustian deals selling their soul to the Devil aka Lucifer¬†, Satan, Allah, Isis, Nike & countless other names.  Welcome to the Grand Illusion where your vote means absolutely nothing. Democracy is an illusion of choice. Both candidates work for the same puppet masters. One shadow government called the Committee of 300 controls all governments of the world including China, N Korea, Russia, Iran, the US/UK empire & of course the current state of Israel which was founded by the Rothschilds who are generational Satanists which explains why they put the occult Hexagram star on the Israeli flag against the objections of many Jews who knew it is thee most important symbol of the occult.....Don't believe me ?
