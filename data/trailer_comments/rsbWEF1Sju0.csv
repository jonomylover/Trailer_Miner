Aldis Hodge who played MC Ren didn't have much to say as if MC Ren wasn't important. NWA would've sucked without MC Ren after Ice Cube left LOL. What a joke. MC Ren is my favorite music rapper in NWA. I love Straight Outta Compton album and album cover. Ice Cube's son who was in the movie as Ice Cube looks just like his father. It was funny seeing Ice Cube and Eazy E with jhericurls LOL. I'm glad this movie was made because NWA deserved to have their story told. Paul Giamatti who was Ruthless records owner Jerry Heller in Straight Outta Compton movie is a good actor. I saw him in Shoot Em Up movie with Clive Owen and Monica Belucci. That's a good movie. I also like Alexandra Shipp who was Ice Cube's son wife in Straight Outta Compton movie. She's hot. Alexandra was in a movie about dead r&b music singer Aaliyah that came on Lifetime channel. I liked the Aaliyah movie. Alexandra received a lot of hate from Aaliyah's fans. I think Alexandra did a good job. I miss Aaliyah. She was hot. I like the other actors who were Dr Dre, Eazy E and DJ Yella in Straight Outta Compton. I love NWA. I wish Dr Dre, Ice Cube and MC Ren would do a new NWA album. I believe a new NWA album would come out if Dr Dre wasn't involved because Dr Dre takes too long putting out albums. Look at how long it took Dr Dre to put out Chronic 2001 album after the first Chronic album LOL. Ice Cube and MC Ren should get MC Eiht and Spice 1 to replace Dr Dre and Eazy E for a new NWA album.",0,0,Keith Witcher,rsbWEF1Sju0,0.2176406926406927,2017-09-21 20:11:59,False,False

They told the world what they felt in the form of rap songs. And I hear songs now but Nicki Minaj, Cardi B and Drake and Lil Pump and realize that these guys are just not what it used to be. Dissing tracks weren't what they used to be. It's just copying and pasting and remixing and basically just bullshit. I had no idea how much Ice Cube has contributed to the music industry and to the betterment of black people. I never thought that the guy whom I saw in Ride Along 1 & 2 and in Jump Street, was so good at rap. It just goes to show how great the times were and how things have changed and gone downhill. The rap was so clean. Unique style, amazing lyrics, none of that mumble rap shit that every new rap artist who's coming out now is doing.
