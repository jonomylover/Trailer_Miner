In the original movie, it was clear from the moment he came back that he was evil.  It's much more subtle in the book.  All the characters feel something is off about the cat, but he really doesn't show his true colors until the climax.  The kids in masks are replacements for the Native Americans.  It's a PC move, through and through.  Diesel truck jump scare not only works, but is canon to the book!  The area is literally described as shown in the trailer.  The trucking road is a major discussion point for all the adult characters, and a major plot point as well.

2018-10-10T18:06:23,"Paramount & filmmakers - I hope some of you read this: I'm a gigantic fan of Pet Sematary and just got finished hearing the newly released audiobook, read by Michael C. Hall, which was absolutely intense, hellish and mercilessly tragic! I've been anticipating the new trailer like crazy, to see what kind of ""feel"" it would throw off. The movie was (and I still want it to be) one of my most anticipated of 2019! But I just saw the trailer and I have to ask something: WHY put so much effort in to showing off kids in animal-like masks? What's up with those masks coming in to people's homes? Why is that the focus here? Where's the book in all of this? In this trailer, it's as if the kids are drawn to the Pet Sematary for some evil hellish reason, which in the book, not to neglect the old movie either, is NOT the case. It's a place of rest, ""build by brokenhearted children"". Never though, did it draw in kids for any evil or manipulating reasons - It's a good place, it's a safe place. The Micmac-burial ground BEHIND the pet sematary is the evil place. That's the irony, hidden within Kings pages. The Pet Sematary seems like a scary place but really, it is not. It's what lies further behind that's evil. It honestly seems like they're changing up that angle, and if so, it's quite simply unacceptable, no matter what new take they're trying to spin on it. ""The barrier was not meant to be crossed"", in the words of a certain Victor Pascow.. This trailer here, I'm sorry to say, makes it seem as if the filmmakers, whom said this new adaptation would be much truer towards King's book, don't really know what they're dealing with? I'm seriously not meaning to bash any one or to be a disrespectful dick about it :-( It's just the first impression I'm getting (and yes, I know it's just a trailer - but still) There's so much focus on kids in damn animal-masks, why? It felt like a movie from 2008, starring Liv Tyler, called ""The Strangers"". This trailer here, sadly, also seems to rely HEAVY on those typical and way played out ""jerk-motion-effects""; something ""The Ring"" & ""Grudge"" made famous 15 some years ago :-( I pray this was only something created for the trailer... Where's the DEAD people in this thing? Where's the atmosphere? Where's the main-theme? The main theme here (again) seems to be kids in animal-masks? I don't mean to be harsh (in fact, I HATE to come off that way) but damn. It's like it's not even a trailer for Pet Sematary and just some other random ""Sinister 3"" movie, or something :-( That being said, it's clear that they're holding back, I can detect that much and I'm perfectly fine with such things - in fact, I admire it. I was just praying for a more Pet Sematary-like trailer for the movie, based upon the book :-( I'm not saying the filmmakers don't necessarily know what they're doing, cause the movie might still turn out great when seen in its entirety. I'm simply saying, based upon the trailer here, it seems to me that they're missing the mark by a landslide, focusing on kids in animal-masks, filling the whole trailer - as if they're the main villains? :-( Honestly, I hope to God that I'll end up eating back my words, cause I'm rooting for this film to succeed like a mad-man!!

Other than that it is faithful and a good adaptation.  Now they have the money and they exagerate. They try to make it overly creepy and overly atmospheric.   What to make a good SK film?

It looks like it'll be more like the first movie but with a few differences. The original movie also felt more close to how I envisioned the characters when reading the novel. This movie looks like it'll be okay, but I'm worried that's what it's going to be. Just okay. When I want it to be as good as the first movie or the book. I also really liked Pet Sematary 2, for what it was. So, hopefully this turns out just as good as them, but I have my doubts. The casting for Louis seems way off to me though.

2018-10-11T17:54:27,"Hello, Humans. ""I too once had a family, Danny. Many years ago I lived in Japan: a pet of my master Yoshi, mimicking his movements from my cage and learning the mysterious art of Ninjitsu, for Yoshi was one of Japan's finest shadow warriors. His only rival was a man named Oroko Saki, and they competed in all things, but in nothing more fiercely than for the love of a woman, Tang Shen. Shen's love was only for my master and rather than see him fight Saki for her hand, she persuaded Yoshi to flee with me to America. But Saki vowed vengeance. I remember it well, as my master returned home to find his beloved Shen lying on the floor, and then he saw her killer. Saki wasted no words, and during the struggle, my cage was broken. I leapt to Saki's face, biting and clawing, but he threw me to the floor and took one swipe with his Katana, slicing my ear.

2018-10-11T18:36:11,"My name is Dr. William Ferraiolo. I have authored a book which contains a collection of meditations in the Stoic tradition that I believe would be an excellent addition to your personal or institutional library. This collection is unique in that each meditation is presented in the second person, encouraging the reader to examine their struggles and failures in the pursuit of self-improvement and enlightenment. The following is a sample meditation that illustrates this:  ‚ÄúEverything that can suffer, does suffer. Everything that can die, will die. You have suffered, you will suffer much more, and a lifetime of your suffering will culminate in your death. When you can muster genuine gratitude for all of that, then you will have made the kind of progress that is not easily reversed. To develop sincere appreciation for this opportunity to be born in a brutal world, not of your making, to struggle and fail time and time again, to feel repeatedly lost, bewildered, frustrated, and hopeless, to swim in this ocean of misery, and, ultimately, to drown in it‚Äîthis is the beginning of wisdom. You must embody overwhelming gratitude for the opportunity to fail repeatedly, with no guarantee of eventual success, and to wade cheerfully into a doomed struggle against time and your own limitations. You clamber toward your own death across a landscape of thorns, broken glass, and the corpses of those who have gone before you. Would you have it any other way?‚Äù  You can purchase my book through Amazon (see links below):  https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1785355872/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1510265657&sr=8-1#featureBulletsAndDetailBullets_secondary_view_div_1527522634362  https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B075ZHCGKV/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=&sr=  Thank you for your consideration, Dr. William Ferraiolo",0,0,William Ferraiolo,VllcgXSIJkE,0.11174242424242425,2018-10-11 18:36:11,True,True

2018-10-12T04:57:18,"Dear precious one, it is so important for you to know that Jesus Christ is your refuge, strength and an ever-present Help in times of trouble. Therefore, you don't need to be afraid of anything -- not even cataclysmic circumstances. The media are increasingly devoted to fear-inducing subject matter: terrorism, serial killers, environmental catastrophes.   If you focus on such dangers and forget that Jesus Christ is your Refuge in all circumstances, you will become increasingly fearful. Every day He manifests His grace in countless places and situations, but the media takes no notice. Jesus showers not only blessings but also outright miracles on our planet. As you grow closer to Jesus Christ, He will open your eyes to see more and more of His presence all around you. Things that most people hardly notice, like shifting shades of sunlight, fill you with heart-bursting  joy.   You have eyes to see and ears that hear, so proclaim Jesus Christ's abiding presence in the world this very moment by first acknowledging you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome the righteousness of Jesus Christ into your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be sealed and justified in salvation.  You will be rewarded greatly and your life will be forever changed! God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è      (Psalm 46 : 1-3;  Psalm 89 : 15).",11,4,msdogooder,VllcgXSIJkE,0.1757936507936508,2018-10-12 04:57:18,True,True

2018-10-12T05:08:53,I grew up in Ludlow. This story always freakin me out as a kid. We had an old pet cemetery about 2 miles in the woods behind the farm house too.  That I built up after finding and put all our Huskies in the ground myself.  We also had moved to Ludlow in the first place because my Grandfather opened up his own pharmaceutical business in town. I knew this was just a book but the possibility that these stories were from real life and the fact I was actually living it made it hard to separate. I was terrified and thrilled to spend time in the cemetery as a child because of this book.   Such a weird experience and hard to explain.

If you've ever seen Into The Wild, there's a scene at the end that shows the character completely emaciated and barely able to stand. It was a very sad scene.

On the other hand, look at what they did with IT! Personally, I considered that a great remake, partly because of all the callbacks to the book.  If there's one Stephen King story that I would like to see remade, it's The Shining. Yes, yes, I know. The original was an AMAZING MOVIE. It's a classic. But it's also not a great representation of the book.

I loved his introductions welcoming you to his stories. Dear Constant Reader, is how it started. His epilogues were just as great. But in his later book's, it didn't feel like his style or writing. I haven't read any of his book's since The Cell. It didn't feel like his. At first glance it does, but then you lose the King bond somewhere in it. Some of the newer ones do not have a personal invitation to join him in the books horror filled pages in his 'Dear Constant Reader' prologue. He was my favorite writer for 30 some odd years and something happened to his writing style. It's like it's not him.  I can't even read them now. I miss the excitement of waiting for his newest book. Heck, I could even afford the hardback ones now and wouldn't have to wait for the paperback. I  even refused to watch any of his movies before I had read the book.

2018-11-28T05:05:37,"*Spoilers ‚ÄúI read the book and watched the original movie for new comers.‚Äù *        So basically, the main character moves into his new home with his family. His cat churchhill gets run over by a car so his neighbor who‚Äôs been living in that area for a long time takes him into the cemetery. Their is a separate cursed cemetery that broken down logs lead to which is an ancient Indian burial ground. I have no idea what those masked kids are there‚Äôs for since it‚Äôs not in the book. He then buries his cat with his neighbor Judd. The next day his cat comes back to life, but different. It has been possessed by an evil spirit. After, the protagonist job is a doctor so then he has to treat a case on one of his patients who got hit by a car. A spirit now in contact with him after he visited the cemetery now possessed his dead patient calling to him, and wanting him to go back to the cemetery for some reason. It then stops possession. His son, then gets hit by the truck in the beginning, foreshadowing what will eventually happen while he was at a picnic with his neighbor Judd. The protagonist then gets the stupid reason to bury his son in the ancient burial grounds, which he does. His son then comes back, but evil and now possessed. His son goes to Judd‚Äôs house and then proceeds to kill him. The mother wanders in seeing her son, and that he‚Äôs alive. In a trance thinking he‚Äôs alright, her son proceeds to kill her. The protagonist then kills his son and burns down the house, and takes his wife to the cemetery to bring her back. He does and then she kills her husband. Now leaving the daughter Eileen an orphan. The end, hope you enjoy the movie since I sure will.",3,2,Samurai Dylan,VllcgXSIJkE,-0.0927008177008177,2018-11-28 05:05:37,True,True

And just that cheap ""jump-scare"" of the truck blasting by on the highway...gimme a freakin' break. WHY? Why for once can't someone (other than Kubrick, who I doubt is available-RIP) do an intelligent adaptation of King's novels? King should have almost NOTHING to do with anything other than maybe the screenplay adaptation. I'm not sure how much (if any) King had to do with this film, but his strength lay in writing, NOT movie making. Oh man, if they just could stop making these IQ32 level films and make an intelligent film. 120 minutes with no gimmicks, just the cold harsh realities of the novel and its message that death is certain and life is not. ARGHHHH, this just pisses me off. Hollywood has reached rock bottom and it's so sad. To think of the masterpieces of the late-60's through even the 80's (but especially the 70's, of course).

The cat Church then goes into the road to lure Ellie, and Ellie is hit by the truck! This is real because in the script it includes the children with drums, and that shot of the cat in the road is where Ellie dies. Ellie is then resurrected, and rather than Louis die at the end, it's Rachel. The spinning girl we see in the trailer is the undead Ellie, who twirls around in the script.  Proof is how in the script, there are a lot of scenes in here that are in it, like the kids with drums, and the elevator shaft. Those hands in the trailer are to big to belong to a toddler, and that coffin in the trailer is WAY too big for a toddler, and would belong to someone the size of Ellie.  There's this whole thing in the script with black pupils and irises, and if you look closely in the trailer, Church in Ellie's room has a black pupil and a black iris.",0,2,Writers Room,VllcgXSIJkE,0.04116161616161616,2019-01-18 15:05:54,True,True

2019-02-06T17:12:17,"People here are so busy saying so much from the book was left out of the original movie. What it seems, most of you are completely unaware of, is that Stephen King himself wrote the screenplay for the original movie. Also you cant take 600 pages of a novel and put all of that in a movie unless you want the movie to be 3 hours long. And Stephen King even had a cameo as a priest. It had that King feeling about it, because King was so involved in it. They litterally shot the movie on loacation in Maine, 5 minutes from where King lives. You cant beat that. This movie was shot in Canada.   And from what I understand they changed everything this time around. Gage doesnt die, his sister does. Not to mention the kids with the animal masks that was not in the book, nor in the original movie. And probably many more things.  And yes this is a remake of the original movie. It's not a re-adaptation of the book. Only the original movie is and can be an adaptation of the book. That goes for all movies based on books. Only the first movies can be called adaptations. You cant just change a fact like that, because it suits you, to make this probably shitty remake seem like a new fresh movie.",7,0,Thomas Studstrup,VllcgXSIJkE,0.23952020202020202,2019-02-06 17:12:17,True,True

So they may be adding a few things but they are not FOLLOWING the book....because if they were they wouldnt have changed Gage being the one who dies.  That changed alot in the story.

In fact, along with Cujo and Christine, one of the most faithful as well as enjoyable King adaptation there is of his purely horror novels (Misery is more of a thriller and an excellent one at that, and shining, while unsurpassed, is too different from the book).  So of course, i'm eagerly waiting for this new take. On the original adaptation, Fred Gwynne was fantastic as Jud Crandall, he nailed the Maine accent and was all around likable. The scenes with Zelda (played by a male actor) were truly unnerving. The only thing missing was the story of the Wendigo which is the scariest part in an already scary book.  The trailer looks good, storywise, and John Litgow is always a welcomed addition, he's so talented.  I hope they won't back down from the gore or scares as Stephen King himself admitted Pet Sematary was his scariest novel, though i am worried because it was said there would be some story changes and that is not always a good thing, though, it is reported that King approved those changes.

2019-03-12T15:44:51,"as someone whos read the book and loved the first movie, this thing is going to be terrible. theyve shown in their trailer that they have removed everything that made the original film truly frightening and replaced it with a bunch of cliches. Zelda, in the film, was played my a man, in order to give it a physically warped and psychologically disturbing feel. and it worked. it worked so well, they used the same tactic in the film, The Ring, with Samara, with similar results. But now, theyre acting like thats an amateur approach. So, they just cast a little girl and its not going to feel like anything else but a little girl. its going to be sad, not bone chilling... They opted for some pretty cat, made to look menacing with cgi, insted of using a real cat that looks and sounds menacing on its own. They wanted a pretty cat. this already tells me they are relying on looks and cgi to carry the film, and ignoring what makes the book and film truly scary, the realism and depth... Using Ellie as the child Louis loses, insted of Gage, well, come on, how gut wrenching was it to see a toddler die by running out into the road, chasing a kite? theres no way using Ellie is going to lend more to the emotional power of the story. That moment in the original film haunted people for a lifetime. They wanted to use Ellie, so they could give the dead child more depth and more to do, well, thats just lazy filmaking. because you dont need to add more PLOT to a BOOK with plot to spare. And it was the subtlety that made Gage so scary. He was not that mobile, but his parents grief caused them to welcome the little zombie into their arms without fear of consequences. thats the point of the book. thats the point of the whole story. how disarmed a grieving parent becomes to logic and danger, in the midst of their bereavement. i cringe at the thought of what they want to make of Ellies character. i just know its going to be garbage... People keep mentioning ""the wendigo"", like we are going to get to see the wendigo, well, the wendigo is not a central theme of the book. the book does not make the wendigo a character, it is a passing reference to mythology. and barely focused on to any substantial degree with concern for the plot. im like, this story does not NEED a MONSTER to make it scary or carry out its design. it is scary enough as it is. and how could they even have enough film time to add more story or plot elements? the problem with adapting books to film is you have too much story and not enough screen time. so what are they thinking? seriously?.... and the fact that they are just opting not to let Judd have a new england accent, that is what painted the eerie tone of Judds character in the book and movie. It was creepy. the accent gets into your psyche and lends to the ambiance of the story. paints a mood. theres no reason not to have it, unless John Lithgow just cant do a new england accent for some reason. but its an easy accent, and whats the problem...... also, what is the deal with the kids wearing animal masks? thats nowhere in the book. are they trying to combine children of the corn for flair, or tongue in cheek, since its stephen king? UNNECESSARY. again, this story is scary enough without all this garbage. and i doubt theyll have time to flesh out relationships between main characters with all this ""reboot"" filler garbage. theres no cult of children in the book, or first film. and it wouldnt make sense if there was. its not part of the story. so how are they going to add that without it being pointless?... and pascow and timmy were two very crucial elements in the story and first film, that were already done to perfection. changing pascows character(im not talking about his race, but his origin. making him something more powerful and wise.) and omitting the story of timmy is totally needless. pascow is already everything the story needs him to be. why would you add extra layers when the story doesnt require it?...... Also, why show the scene where Judd gets his achilles tendon cut IN THE TRAILER??? are you trying to give the entire movie away? That scene in the first film was a huge punch to the psyche, and youre just going to waste that moment for a gag in the preview or some kind of throwback nod? break the fourth wall some more why dont you. do you even care about making a film thats going to be scary, or is this a joke? because it looks like a joke. it looks like that is the whole point of this effort, to make fun of the original film and book asif they are basic. man, you cant hold a candle to the original. you dont understand HALF of what is necessary to do what the originals did and  i feel embarrassed for you.",0,0,Leto77,VllcgXSIJkE,-0.007465477560414289,2019-03-12 15:44:51,True,True

Zelda was just sick in the first movie. In this one, she's sick and evil. They made Pascow the token black guy in this movie. lol (That was the cheesiest part. And he wasn't that perfect combination of creepy and funny, like in the first movie. Pascow was perfect in 1989. Pretty lame in 2019.) Rachel is kind of annoying. Ellie is far sweeter and more likeable in this movie. ""Undead Ellie"" in 2019 is more like Ellie 1989. Haha And to top it all off....I was sitting in the same row with a disruptive jerk who got up and left the theater 3-4 times, kept looking at her phone, giggling at inappropriate times either at the whisper conversation she was having or at something in the movie she thought was dumb. Or would loudly, randomly crinkle her chip bag....just a  desperate need for constant attention or something. She clearly didn't want to be there. I have been to countless movies and I pretty much have never dealt with a problem person in a theater. The crowds I'm with are always quiet, even when the place is packed....and it wasn't this time.

So many things are wrong with this film that it'd pointless to list them. The book is brilliant and the original film adaptation is one of the best horror movies ever, still today it is standing tall. Scripted by The Author himself delivers the goods as not many. Those actors were well chosen and the flick was sharp as it could be on its budget and its era. This one... is pure nonsense. The creators failed to choose any good actors, the director was shamefully bad and obviously nobody has read the book. They came up with some horrible ideas and absolutely ignored basic characteristics of the created characters; cellphones, modern cars, girl-power and a total nonsense endin' creates yet another rip-off production. Give 'em your 13 bucks, and they will be happy. You, who woulda liked to see the book being put on the silver screen will remain puzzled, asking yourself if you'd seen the same story. No value in this one, halfway down the line the makers decided they'd be more witty than the writer himself so they simply threw the story away and took a different route, a short cut, a simple formula of these jap-ghost-film type of ghoulish women in dirt, not too much blood, jump scares and some irrelevant murder spree at the end with a few zombie stuff thrown in. 0 points out of 10 or even 5, this production sucks.",1,0,PomyCollingwood,VllcgXSIJkE,0.03718966218966218,2020-02-26 15:17:56,False,False
