Let me tell you it sucks to be sick and on your death bed. There are no handsome men to save you, there is no beauty in being sick, in feeling like crap all the time. üòû If we are going to talk about chronic illness, let's talk about the realities. The fact that you are in pain all the time, or the fact that you have to take 20 different medications a day, or the fact that you have to struggle for every breath you take. How about the fact that being immunocompromised absolutely sucks, and that we actually could die if we were exposed to dangerous germs. This is no fake crap that is just something to be messed around with and twisted into by Hollywood into a beautiful romantic story. This is sad, and I can't see any reasons that we should keep supporting these kinds of movies. Chronic illness is messy, tragic, and painful.

2019-09-08T01:35:35,"I just read this book for a class and I got curious about the movie. They took a lot of creative liberties with the movie. Like Maddy swimming in the ocean. How is she swimming? She certainly could not do it in the novel. Also, Maddie's mom is Japanese, not black. I understand them updating with their contact from instant messenger to text messages gotta keep it current. My frustration with books turning into movies is that it ALWAYS seems so rushed. I'll watch this movie not expecting anything spectacular.",1,0,Frank Hayes,sjbG_NHjmdM,0.16220238095238096,2019-09-08 01:35:35,False,False
