Because obviously accurate race depiction in ""Historical"" films xo not matter right?  2014 and still Hollywood will whitewash everything. I dunno. Maybe they think white people won't be interested in stories that had nothing to do with their race and ancestors if other people's ancestors are shown in true non white form in movies.
