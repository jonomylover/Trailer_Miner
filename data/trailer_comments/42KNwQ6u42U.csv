A month after, she was diagnosed with such a sickness that caused her to never be able to go outside. Fast forward to many years later, and a new boy, Olly moves in next door and Madeline can't help but love him. They talk from window writing, e-mail, and texting and finally, one day he comes into her house. Madeline's well aware he could make her so sick, but after a few of these visits, they kiss. Madeline realizes there is more to life then just being alive and goes to Hawaii with Olly and she gets very sick there. When she returns home, she looks inside her folder of old medical papers and realizes she never had a sickness. Because of losing her husband and son, Madeline's mother made it all up to never let Madeline leave. Madeline runs away from her mother to where Olly moved to and lives there with him.

I would like to see Nick Robinson be given edgier movies. He would probably get to the same level as Ansel Elgort. Baby driver suited Ansel Elgort perfectly, but his role in The Flaut in Our Stars did not suit him, well. I'm glad Ansel is finally getting more attention for his great performance on Baby driver. However, I believe the same thing can happen to Nick Robinson If he were lucky enough to get casted to play the role of a bad boy. I did like Everything Everything but I believe that Nick just needed to really be involved in more edgy films. Let's hope that after Everything Everything he will finally come out to be more popular by doing more successful films.",0,0,Adriana Sam,42KNwQ6u42U,0.2833333333333333,2017-11-12 23:41:14,False,False
