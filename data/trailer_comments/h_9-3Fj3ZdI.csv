Now before anyone starts to say dumb things like ""athletes are strong or fast etc"" yeah they are for a human lol compare that to a lion, bear, wolfs sharks or in this case an ape.

Maybe Caesar did this update. But my comment of Wahlberg ending with Ape filled Washington DC I really wanna See. I just hope Tim Burton doesn't decide to do stick figure planet of Apes nightmare before Christmas edition. I unfortunately think Mr. Burton has ate 1 to many hits of acid or 1 to many shrooms. I just think a planet with apes in place of humans would be so much more interesting than the Caesar ones the last couple have been. In original Planet of Apes it wasn't in D.C. but it was like Wahlberg version were the apes did Talk it wasn't just a bunch of angry apes that figured how to break out of cells & fight to get to the woods that's just my 2 cents on the mater. ,0,0,Silverado4x4,h_9-3Fj3ZdI,0.20069444444444443,2013-12-23 02:35:00,True,True

2013-12-23T14:11:36,I just wanted to clear things up for all the people hating that probably didn't see the first movie... @Roger Lee - It is very realistic because after the first movie a virus had been spreading throughout the world that had caused chaos between the humans which caused them to destroy everything with wars and fights. Apes then took everything that had been destroyed and abandoned and made it their home. And like you see in the trailer small bands of survivors want what was originally theirs back. We wouldn't have many weapons to fight back because we had used them all on each other because of the virus. So what I'm trying to say is that the humans couldn't fight back because more than half of them have been wiped out by the virus!,0,0,KieeM8,h_9-3Fj3ZdI,0.1005952380952381,2013-12-23 14:11:36,True,True

The only possible way that humans could defeat apes in battle would be to force them to fight two-dimensional battles. Logically apes would never face humans in open areas where they would be forced to fight on the ground without cover but would either hide in dense, climbable areas (this presents a problem if humans fully unite against the apes (which they don't according to this trailer) and set all climbable areas ablaze to force them into open areas) or create dense climbable areas (like the one seen at 0:21 made of fallen trees).",1,0,Jacob DeFazio,h_9-3Fj3ZdI,0.04393939393939394,2014-02-02 06:51:43,True,True

2014-03-13T05:09:32,"I took a class at university; sort of a 'the science of science fiction' kind of thing. We discussed Rise in the class; we talked about how realistic the new movies are. In it, we talked about how the ALZ112 gene therapy not only gave apes human-like intelligence but also emotions and eventually the ability to talk. One person pointed out that even if apes could become that smart, they still wouldn't be able to talk because of their physiology; vocal cords. But then, someone else pointed out that the ALZ112 was intended to treat a human disease (alzeimer's) so it probably contained human genes. So when Caesar inherited the ALZ112 from his mom, the presence of human genes could have mutated (just slightly) his physiology to be more like a human's which explains his physical ability to talk. So in a way, the Evolved apes are kind of a hybrid species with both ape and (but a minimal amount of) human DNA; if you want to get all technical about it.",0,0,Dart Mada,h_9-3Fj3ZdI,0.14415584415584415,2014-03-13 05:09:32,True,True
