Not trying to turn this into a religious segment but just remember this, ONE DAY within 20 years time, this society WILL BECOME CASHLESS AND THEN the mark of the beast will be a chip just like in this movie, that the goverment will tell you JUST LIKE in this movie that YOU MUST RECEIVE IT INTO YOUR RIGHT HAND or forehead in order for you to receive your paychecks or buy groceries etc...   HOWEVER the bible say whosoever receives this mark of the beast, WILL BURN IN HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY. PLEASE BE WARNED that NOT ONLY will you be jeopardizing your souls if you take this chip into your skin that IS COMING very soon, BUT the government HAS THE POWER to control you with this chip and THAT INCLUDES DETONATION or killing you by the push of a button JUST LIKE in this movie, or by tracking you etc.....Remember I told you this Remember I WARNED YOU GUYS PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE CHIP WHICH IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST and it's coming very soon. Accept Yahshua aka Jesus into your hearts and turn from your sins NOW. He will provide for you in that day IF you reject this chip the mark of the beast.  You may think I'm crazy BUT when this society goes cashless and you cannot buy or sell without that chip in your skin, THEN you will remember that crazy girl from youtube and you will say WOW she was telling the truth and then hopefully you will make the right choice at that time.
