Years ago my grandfather (who basically raised me because my parents were still in high school) passed away. For his funeral I played this song on guitar while singing in front of the church. I broke down once and had to start over but I'm glad i did it.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I've been basically living with my girlfriend and her parents for the past 4.5 years and got close to her family. Recently her mom passed away pretty suddenly. I decided I would play ""I Can Only Imagine"" for her funeral as well since she loved when when I played guitar or piano for her and because of how special the song is to me. That funeral was on Sunday, three days ago. I just learned today that a movie of the making of this song was coming out and in TWO DAYS.   I'm probably just being emotional but this seems very special to me. I'm not normally a very religious person but maybe this movie can be special to me just like the song is. Anyway, thank you anyone who took time to read my story. No real purpose to this, I just felt like writing and sharing.

I lost my mother almost 2 years ago. I miss her ,  she is in heaven with her father now. 7 years ago I had went to Tennessee for my 4th year anniversary. I phoned my mother and her and my father came to Tennessee to see the timeshare that I had purchased while I was there.  I took my mother to a movie and a show there and this was the song that it was all done around. I will never forget this memory. Now that she has went home, I can only image what she is doing up there with God. One day I will join her there and get to finally know what I could only imagine. When I purchased the time share , I assumed there would be plenty of family vacations to follow. Life is a funny thing, and it is given by God . The bible says we must call upon his name to be saved, repent of our sins and know that it is only by the shedding of the blood of Jesus that we are saved. He died on the cross for our sins and arose the 3 day. We could never imagine the pain and suffering he  went through , the bible says that There was hardly any flesh let on his bones. Now just imagine how much he loves us. Then goes to prepare a place for us to live with him for ever.

Jesus if you can raise a nation up and take it down in a day, then Jesus can you not heal our nation and our people.Yes you can,we praise the name of Jesus. Jesus, quickly reveal yourself to us, that is best for each one of us, touch us the only place that you know and can touch, Jesus can you not minister individually to each person, the only way that they can be ministered to,. Jesus are you not greater than any and all calamity and evil, Jesus where a man sees no way out, your spirit testifies that you Jesus, you are the only way out. Jesus you are the author and finisher of all things, great and small. Jesus help us receive your perfect and perfecting love and forgiveness of the cross. Jesus you told me that if we could fully receive and understand the love and forgiveness of the cross, we would be transformed as a new spirit, a useful witness for Christ Jesus. Jesus we pray that you answer this prayer, that we receive THE FULL PORTION,of your perfect love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ.Jesus we praise your perfect love and forgiveness. Jesus we pray for personal and professional revival Lord Jesus not only does it have to happen in our heart, it has to happen in our family and in our workplace,,, Lord bring us to where your people are, there's no greater ministry then in our own families in our own workplace, Jesus show us the way to your fullness. Jesus you said, to pray for the greatest gift to prophesy to strengthen, encourage and comfort our people, to help raise them up. Jesus we repent of godless chatter, a lack of faith. Jesus we need the faith the size of a mustard seed to plant our faith at the altar,Jesus you will grow our faith. Jesus help us be the great communicators of your love and forgiveness, your faithfulness. Jesus Christ we pray that you come quickly, we need you and praise your mighty name, Jesus our Lord and Savior. Jesus come quickly, Jesus we cry out for repentant heart and spirit, seeking the perfect love and forgiveness, found only in Christ Jesus. Jesus is not the simple gospel, can be as simple as, the perfect and perfecting love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ. Jesus is this not available to all people saved and unsaved. Jesus we pray for this great awakening, correction, direction pointing to Christ Jesus, as Lord and Savior. The name of Jesus is above all names, the name of Jesus identifies the God we serve, the God that can save, forgive us of our sins, and love us into eternity now and forever. Jesus cannot the zeal of the Lord accomplish this great revival, harvest this great harvest and free our people, from captivity of the world and the evil one. Jesus not all is lost, but always gained, we hear that this is the greatest time and harvest, that the world will ever see. Jesus, Jesus, quickly come. Jesus we are standing in victory and not in defeat, because the victory was won on the cross let us praise your great name the name above all names, Christ Jesus our Savior and Lord, amen and amen.

He returns home and one way or the other father is a changed man/is trying to become a better man. (probably listened to the songs he made etc.) Then he makes an awesome song in a full theater/show and everybody loves it and is amazed. THE END >.> This is why I don't watch trailers.

Because when i was 11 and in his same situation i was alone, i had been sexually abused, and completely broken. I'll never forget sitting on my bedroom floor crying wondering at 11 years old what the point of taking my next breath was when i turned on the radio, cause all i had at the time was music and poetry it was all i had to express what I'd been through was to write songs, i flipped through the stations and I heard the melody to that song play so i stopped and heard that song play and I knew Jesus Christ himself was speaking to me the words themselves had NOTHING to do with what i was going through but i broke down screaming cause it was the 1st time i knew that God loved me I had no idea of the background to the song but i knew God was holding me from the inside of my soul to the outside of my body. So hearing the story behind it is ministering to my situation now reminding me of that very first moment i had with my Abba Father and how he never lets go, he knew my pain then and he knows it now and will always carry us through if we just let him.
