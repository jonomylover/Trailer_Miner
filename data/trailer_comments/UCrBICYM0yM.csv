Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then.   This isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death! And before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief.

So what if those people don't want to protect them,and try to rule them all?What can you do to fight them?As about 6 inches high,you can't fight them physically,cause to be honest,a normal can just step on you and crush you into nothing.You can't out run them,within one step they will catch up you and you're dead.Even you drive your tiny car,they can just run to you and stomp on the car with you in it and squashed it like a soda can,and you are also dead. Even if tiny people has their own tiny military,I can say one normal size marine can take down at least 100 tiny marine.He can just lay down on them and crush them all in to nothing.And your tiny guns won't do any harm to a normal size marine,they can't even penetrate their gear and won't gonna penetrate the sole of boots. So what about heavy weapons?Sure,that would do some damage,but don't forget the normal size people has that too.They can just launch one missile and your whole city is gone.When you shrunk,you are inferior to all the other people who didn't shrink. And they give you 240 times money that can only be used in that city.The rich or the powerful just don't care these,cause they are already live a great life.But those who don't have a lot money will consider this,it's easier to live in the tiny city than outside.

Too bad once you're that small you've essentially signed away your freedom forever, as you are physically helpless from now on. But hey, you have ""millions"" of dollars that you can spend... that is, if the big people will allow you to have things. So go to your mini mansion in your little AAA battery powered toy smart car and wait to die so that the giants can inherit the earth. If enough people were this small, the few remaining big ones could do whatever they wanted and eventually quit caring for those little villages, abandoning them and leaving the little ones to fend for themselves against the big bad world. It's natural selection with a little bit of help from science.   Of course the exact process is impossible. But if the majority of the world could be duped into permanently adopting a certain way of life such as this ""for the greater good,"" the remaining ones with true freedom would then rule and be able to do whatever they want. That's what is unsettling to me.

If the tiny people can make their own tech to scale, then.... that could be applied to make exponentially more powerful tech for the big people. Right? Making intricate computer components could be a cottage industry of tiny town.  -Natural disasters. There are extremely few places that do not have them to some extent. blizzards, fires, earth quakes. Even a minor rain shower could be the scale equivalent to a major hurricane. Forget about any weather, a lone raccoon could fuck that place up. Where is tiny town? It would pretty much have to be in a building somewhere; someone tending to them like an ant farm.  -$50K=$12.5M in tiny town, as the lady says. It makes sense in the way that your using less land and resources proportionately.   Thinking of GIJoe sized people; how many of them with their own little beds could sleep in just your room? even if you have a small room, at least 20....comfortably, with patricians and personal space. How many of them would it take to finish a $1 fast food burger? maybe 5 if they were really pigging out like, eating contest level. So, everyone goes there to be millionaires on little money. Who is working at those 3 cheesecake factories? It would have to be people who were not even cutting a scrape by existence, and, were forced to shrink, and... now earning tiny dollars... This would mean, if you had debts, and, a negative net worth,the debt would  proportionately increase to match your diminished potential impact through labor.  -They are shrunken irreversibly. Some of these people might have kids. There would be future generations of native small people ; like a separate species of human intelligent tiny creatures ; unless the process renders you sterile, and, that is whole new bag of nuts since, overpopulation/overcrowding is the ultimate drive of this.  You get live a life of comfort providing you sacrifice the ability to reproduce, its all covered up by the novelty of being tiny.",15,2,mullet,UCrBICYM0yM,0.046260712077038614,2017-09-23 05:08:14,True,True

Like per-say “if you join we guarantee you’ll live forever. With endless resources and such. You will be promised a better life”. Well once they go through with it. It becomes kinda sketch. They all basically enjoy their last moments alive. Watch the sunshine dance a bit. Once they’re in the tunnel. The guy asks” Are we going up hill or something?” Then this other guy says yes. “It’s an 11 hour walk. We go up first then down.” Basically saying going through with it and then becoming like some sacrifice. Soooo going to hell ordeal when he meant “down”.I dunno weird ending.

The trailer really leaves a lot out of what the movie is actually about. I was disappointed that the scene depicting a group drinking from a huge vodka bottle ended up not making the final cut. I hap expected he movie to play more on the side of the dichotomy between normal size and miniatures, it wasn’t the case. The movie is more of a character driven piece that uses the miniaturised world as a gimmick to draw you in. Damon’s character is forced to reevaluate his life and find a new purpose. He is a rather depressed character who eventually finds himself through the virtue of altruism.   I went in to this movie with expectations built up by the trailer that just weren’t delivered. For that reason, I do not recommend seeing it based on the trailer. But if you want to see a movie that has a few good laughs, some sub-par CGI, decent character development driven by a thinly veiled love story, then by all means watch it.

The end got a bit confusing, maybe they were packing in too much into a short period of time. But how the film was presented and the overall story I stuck with.   I particularly enjoyed how the film shows you from the very beginning that this process of downsizing and the company behind it are far from perfect, and we see ""larger and larger"" examples (pun intended) as the film progresses. Starting with the way the film depicts the process of downsizing hints at the imperfection and absurdity and dangers of these extreme measures. In these YouTube comments, Water Nebula says ""It's just slightly unnerving seeing the tiny stacks of human bodies on the trays."" Yes, yes it is! Maybe Water Nebula thinks they're the only one to feel that way because the film has such a happy, whimsical song playing during this montage. But I believe that's part of the brilliance of the filmmakers. The filmmakers are making you feel the two sides to the issue of downsizing at the same time; the happiness of the people who support downsizing and are enjoying their new lives - portrayed by the happy music, but also the dark behind the scenes details of it all - as we see in these sterile, white environment where most of the workers seem not to even take it seriously, joking and flirting with each other while on the job.  I mean, isn't that one reason why they knock patients out until they're in the small town? They aren't supposed to see these details. It's like the saying ""You want to eat the burger without knowing where it came from."" Because the process isn't pretty - and in fact, these people do appear to be on a form of assembly line during the process of downsizing.  While the trailer makes it seem like a person can fix their life by downsizing, the actual film suggests the problems in your personal life CAN'T always be solved by downsizing. Sometimes you have to face who you are as a person, regardless of size.",0,0,MagnumDB,UCrBICYM0yM,0.09936252771618626,2018-02-23 21:18:26,False,True

But this film was about the most average/below average bore fest I've seen in a while. Don't get me wrong you'll like the first 45 minutes, although after its just all down hill.  The film basically turns into this thing where you don't even remember they're small anymore, you do ofcourse but it really has almost zero relevance, it's more a film, marketed to look like a really interesting concept which it is, but that's just one layer to make the film easily marketable, the real film, Is about people and emotions & finding your place in the world, the small things count, all that typical shit.  Main characters, or seemingly main characters played by notable actors, just dissappear and never show up again, characters are 1 dimensional, the one women you're supposed to like in the film ""whilst I've gotta agree, well acted at times"" was very unlikeable for alot of it, and her accent was almost used in a parody kind of way, plus I'm sure that Absolute Vodka shot wasn't in the final film btw.   But they do, do alot to keep you remembering they're small, like if you look in the background on one scene you'll see a Polaroid picture on the wall and it looks huge.... Amazing, wow. Its asif the director felt he had to keep doing it cause otherwise the jig was up and we'd find out that being small wasn't the actual premise of the film.

I was right. I didn't. **  This was complete trash. I am being 100% serious I've never seen a worse movie in my life. It's certainly a comedy but not in the way you think. The only ""comedic"" thing about this movie is the fact that an entire production team created this movie and not a single one of them shook their head and spoke up to say ""Nope. Nope not doing it. This... isn't a movie is is actually garbage and I'd rather feed orphaned children into a wood chipper than be an actor / producer / director / script writer for this movie."" Not a single person said that. They all just stood in their places with their poker faces on knowing full well this movie will go down in history as the worst thing humanity has created. It's mind-blowingly awful.  There is no plot. The movie just follows Matt Damon around as he undertakes one depressing adventure after the other. First him and his wife have no money and are concerned with how they're going to get by, then his wife leaves him alone with no money and 2 inches tall in a city by himself, then he meets another woman but she rejects him, then he works a low wage job as tech support, then he meets another woman, then she takes advantage of him and makes him do stuff for him, then he accidentally breaks her prosthetic foot, then to make it up to her he is basically her slave and does her work and gives her the money, then he flees the country to get away from her but she comes with, then he realizes he's somehow in love with her (awww) but decides to leave anyway cus he wants to live in some vault for the rest of his life, then he changes his mind because it's too long of a walk, then he goes and lives in the slums where everyone is in makeshift plywood houses and starving and the movie ends at him looking at an old man.

2018-05-01T06:29:26,"Downsizing is an intelligent and, by American standards, subtle cinematic science-fiction social satire about the individual’s problem of securing sufficient wealth to comfortably sustain their lives in a secure cosmopolitan community for the duration of their lifespan. Downsizing was not well-received by the majority of the viewing public because it is a film about ideas, thus requiring thinking for its enjoyment, as opposed to being a cinematic delivery vehicle for emotive sensations and jolting stimuli to provide passive unthinking viewers with 135 minutes of thrilling distraction. The “lesson” in the screenplay of Downsizing, which was delivered in a clear sedately-paced and understated way (which I like), is that the solution for achieving fulfilling individual lives in peaceful and comforting societies is for the people of such would-be societies to take care of one another: popular humanitarian socialism. This idea is captured visually so simply in the last moments of Downsizing that it remains invisible to the majority of the viewing public.

Here are a couple of reasons why I liked it:   - The film comes with surprises. In addition to downsizing and the environment, it explores other themes you don't expect at first. - It values scientific accuracy. I wouldn't say it's 100% accurate because it's impossible, but unlike many sci-fi blockbusters, it tries to be consistent and realistic. The entire process by which downsizing was invented and the micro-communities formed is carefully explained and seems pretty okay to me. - Characters are from several different nationalities. The protagonist is American, the inventor is Norwegian, the neighbor is Serbian, and the activist is Vietnamese. It also takes place partly in Norway. I like the cosmopolitan approach in lieu of excessive Americanism. - One of the themes it explores is how people can act unexpectedly sometimes. In my opinion, the ending teaches us to look at small things in our lives instead of big ones (what a double entendre!)   This film has a unique feel. It's different but interesting. Perhaps the reason people disliked it is because they're too used to the usual.",0,0,0YTMan,UCrBICYM0yM,0.12031249999999999,2019-04-12 05:53:31,False,False

Hawks, eagles, falcons, and owls would be swooping down on that city and snapping people up right and left.  Even crows might snack on you.  Down on the ground, you'll have to hide from foxes, weasels, coyotes, rats, raccoons, cats, dogs, and probably dozens of other predatory mammals.  Oh, and snakes.  I think frogs might eat you too.  And let's not forget:  bees, wasps, spiders, and ants will be gigantic and will definitely kill you if they get a hold of you.  If some fire ants found a way into that city, they'd pretty much destroy it.  Just imagine a tick latching onto your leg!  And a mosquito would suck you dry before you could get it off you, and let's not even think about a swarm of mosquitos descending on you.  Let's just face facts:  this would have been a good horror movie, but as a human journey of self-discovery it falls flat.  Sure, get Matt Damon to just quit his job and leave his wife and hook up with that Asian chick to help people - could have been a decent movie in there somewhere.  But this?  It was a bad joke.
