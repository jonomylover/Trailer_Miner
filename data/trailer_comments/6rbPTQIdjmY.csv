2016-07-23T22:53:06,Finally we have been waiting for this since they first announced it. Charlie Hunnam plays the legendary warrior king known for pulling the sword from the stone. We have Petyr Baelish and Roose Bolton in this film too. Eric Bana plays Uther Pendragon(Arthur's dad) while Jude Law plays evil uncle Vortigern(who was just in Once Upon a Time as Vortigan). This film comes out the same day as Power Rangers and I know both movies will do amazing at the box office because we have both Jude Law and Elizabeth Banks playing fantastic magical badass villains Vortigern and Rita Repulsa. What's the same is it's the battle of the dragons of red and white because it's Arthur(the red) vs Vortigern(the white) in place of his father Uther Pendragon and uncle Ambrosius Aurelianus who both battled Vortigern in the original Arthurian Legends.,0,0,Ty Motekaitis,6rbPTQIdjmY,0.15178571428571427,2016-07-23 22:53:06,True,True

Racism started in the Americas in circa 1600, when a guy sold the first (in the Americas, I mean) black slaves to colonists.  *3)* There was a Knight of the Round Table that was African.

If you guys did your research you would know Black people have had contact with Europe for a very long time even going back to the BC era. for example the Greeks called Black Africans from the Kingdom of Kush aka Nubia Aethiopians which meant Burnt Face people. Even in Greek Mythology Andromida is Aethiopian Princess. Plus the Trojian war had one of the only warriors in the story to fight Achilles on Equal grounds King Memnon again Aethiopian king who brought his army in the story to support Troy. Hannibal Barca's army had a significant amount of Blacks and Berbers in it, evidence are the skulls found on battle fields and in Carthage and the coins made in his honor in Europe with a Black head on it.  Later on in Europe in early Medieval times they called Blacks and other peoples such has Arabs and caucasian Berbers entering Europe from Morocco Moors. The from these groups of the Blacks were sometimes known has BlackaMoors, there are house symbols which had black faces and heads in Europe has well has paintings of Rich Black people and knights living amongst Europeans.",0,0,Admire Kashiri,6rbPTQIdjmY,-0.014063492063492061,2016-07-24 10:43:14,True,True

Bob Pickleson18 horas atr√°s (editado) ""All these comments show how uneducated some people are. 1) King Arthur was not alive during medieval times. He was alive during the Roman Empire, near its ruin but not quite into the Medieval Ages when there became an immense power struggle. He was most likely a Roman Centurion, himself.""  King Arthur didn't exist. And his myth is a celtic myth. He would be celtic, not roman. He would exist during the germanic invasion of the british isles. His defeat is an allegory to the fact that the germanic tribes  (angles, saxons, picts and jutes) conquered part of the british isles (england and wales). he wasnt roman.  ""2) The Roman Empire controlled all of North Africa. It is ignorant to assume no blacks would be in Europe, especially given that this was well before white racism. Racism started in the Americas in circa 1600, when a guy sold the first (in the Americas, I mean) black slaves to colonists.""  The north african werent black, and are not black today. Stop with this racist oversimplification that each continent have one ""race"". Black people werent around in europe that time, especially noth europe. To think otherwise is simply ridiculous. Its revisionism. Also racism always existed. The idea of race changed with time, but racism is as old as we humans are. In fact, one could argue that the celts considered the germanic invador another race.  The ""white"" race and the ""black"" race were inventions of the colonial times, but RACE as a (non-scientific) concept always existed. Stop with this bullshit  ""3) There was a Knight of the Round Table that was African. I thought his name was Sir Morian, but the comments spell it Sir Morien so I guess I forgot the spelling. He was introduced into the Arthurian legends sometime before the United States was a country. It is not a work of SJWs.""  Sir Morian wasnt black. See my previous response. Stop with revisionism.

Anyway, I still hate the way they are portrayed in blockbusters, they have to turn a white supporting character in black (Nick Fury, Heimdall) or they are there just because they need to include diversity in the film (Finn on SW).

So I really don't how to feel about this. Especially because I love Guy Ritchie for his fun and entertaining movies. But the Legend of King Arthur is not just fun and entertaining...its so much more.

Arthur wasn't even a historical figure, he was a character of many versions of French medieval literature, the most famous one being Chretien de Troyes' arthurian romances. There could have been black people, Chinese people at that time, since your mind conceives that black people didn't have a life before made slaves by the American, but they were trading all around the world, today's Spain was full of Maori people and even centuries after, Shakespeare's Othello was black or arab, so what the fuck are you talking about?   The huge elephant scenes were also present in Lord of the Rings, 300 and other films and no one bitched about it then, so why hate this film so much? If you watch all the films made after Shakespeare's plays, even that abomination called Titus, you would see that not in all films they are wearing tights and keep to the tone and script, so hating this film for its inaccuracies about nothing, because you haven't even read the original writings on Arthur is just plain stupid.

2020-05-13T11:56:17,"There is no evidence for the Arthurian story before Geoffrey of Monmouth and Walter of Oxford, in 1135.  (They say they got the story from Brittany or Normandy, because Geoffrey was Norman, not Welsh.). So why the 600-year lacuna, with Arthur missing from history?  (Gildas, Bede and Nennius do not relate the Arthurian story.)   The answer is Arthurian history was brought back from the Near East by the Knights Templar. That is why Parzival starts its Arthurian story in Babylon.  That is why High History and History of the Grail say that Arthurian history was written by Josephus Flavius.  Yes - peculiar isn‚Äôt it.  The truth about Arthurian history is quite amazing.  Arthur did exist, but his history came from the 1st century Near East - and since this story was heretical, the Templars dressed it up as a Celtic legend.  The knights were Gali (a religious sect), not Galles (Welsh).     PS - The Sacred Stone was magnetic, that is why the sword got stuck on it...    See book... ‚ÄúThe Grail Cypher‚Äù.
