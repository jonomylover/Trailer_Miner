Everest is a stunning looking film that you come away from , feeling totally exhausted. Because it is so realistic you do feel you are with the climbers at times. Sure , it's a stock disaster movie but because of the nature of the true story behind it , you feel more connected. The special affects are amazing and the performances from Jason Clarke and Keira Knightley are great too.  I watched this in 3D but ended up taking the glasses off because it was so annoyingly dark so i recommend watching it in 2D instead.  It's a staggering statistic that 1 in 4 people who attempt to get get to the summit of Everest , dies.

2015-09-20T03:51:03,#Everest is an absolute must-see. It's a cinematic landmark and a visual masterpiece. Incredible imagery that puts you there on the mountain. The cast gave us award-worthy dramatic portrayal of the character's triumphs and desperate life and death struggles. There were many tears in the audience as this moving story came to its conclusion. Do yourself a favor and get to an #IMAX theater right away. You will not want to miss this one. I will be shocked if this movie isn't in the running for big accolades during awards season. Five stars all the way.

Why don't they cut away the recognisable old ropes at the start of the climbing season and let it drop away leaving a less complex, less confusing and a all-round tidier route? If the old ropes are left in-situ, what's to stop a befuddled climber using them?  I appreciate its a judgment call on who's to say what is old rope and what if someone is using it?
