A light hearted comedy that was well done! Robert Deniro plays a retired CEO of a once bustling phone book company, now no longer in business due to the high tech computer era. He quickly realizes he's had enough of playing shuffle board and other retirement activities, and that he misses the challenges and the focus of the working world. So he decides to answer an add for a new upstart fashion company looking to hire senior interns to gain more ""old school"" business perspective. He soon learns that while he may be considered ""washed up"" by the much younger employees of this new company..he still has a few tricks up his well pressed sleeve and quickly garners both the admiration and respect of his younger co-workers. The owner of the company played by Ann Hathaway, however, proves to be a much larger but rewarding challenge to the retired CEO.",0,0,LdyWolf,ZU3Xban0Y6A,0.28104978354978355,2015-09-25 04:34:43,False,True

2016-02-24T18:50:07,"The question she says at the end, ""How have men gone from Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford to -looks at dorky men-"". I find really irritating. Western women claim that they like dorky, compassionate, sensitive, some degree of metro-sexuality, humble, nerds and we're bombarded with movies in which a hero that's all that personified, somehow wins the girl. However, lots of studies suggest that women are attracted to very manly, even aggressive/strong, dominant men - it only makes sense from a evolutionary standpoint. So when someone says 'how have men gone this way', the answer is they're aspiring to be attractive to what modern women pretend they like.  I don't know what my point was, I just feel that people seem to hate the current generation of young 20-something men, like we're constantly being told 'oh men have been such bastards for the last century', so when men evolve into these limp, dorky, sensitive guys women look at them in disgust and yearn for some manly men, who they would probably label misogynist if they thought about it for a second.

2016-08-28T05:46:41,"The Intern(2015) Movie Review :  I like these kind of movies where you can sit back and relax. I find the emotions in humans bigger and larger than the powers of superheroes. The Intern is about a young CEO Jules played by Anne Hathaway who has given her everything to set up her e-commerce business. She has taken care of it like her child and brought it to a success within a short span. Even her husband supports her along the way by dropping out from his job and looking after their daughter. However in her hectic schedule she is not be able to spend much time with her family. Even to herself. She is missing her life and her habit of taking everything on her shoulders makes her and her company miss all the schedules. This is where her newly appointed senior intern Ben, played by Robert De Niro, shows her the way to lead her life. The bond between Ben and Jules forms the crux of the story. Ben is a 70 year old widower and a very organized old school person who has worked for 40 years in a phonebook printing office. This movie shows a clear distinction between the two generations and their work culture. And surprisingly,  the old generation seemed to have managed their work pretty well. Eventually,  Jules is able to balance her life as Ben becomes her bestfriend. The movie is of today's generation and we can completely relate it to our corporate lives. The bond between Ben and Jules has been showcased very well and both the lead actors played their roles to perfection. I loved the movie.

2020-06-03T18:21:02,"SPOILERS:   I liked DeNiro‚Äôs character in this film, but Anne Hathaway is utterly unlikable. Agist, immature, control freak, selfish, never makes time for her family and doesn‚Äôt know squat about anyone who works for her. Her husband sacrificed his career to be a stay at home dad, so she can run her company and live her dream. She only seems interested in him when she figures out he has been cheating on her and worries she will lose him. She doesn‚Äôt want to give up any control in her company even though it is taking her away from her family. She treats DeNiro‚Äôs character like he has the plague just because he is old. People act like her husband is selfish for cheating and disappointment that she takes him back in the end. I feel disappointment because she continues to be selfish by being CEO and still not spending any time with her husband and kid. In the end it‚Äôs as if nothing is resolved in a positive way.",1,4,Banana Fanafoferry,ZU3Xban0Y6A,-0.10664335664335665,2020-06-03 18:21:02,False,False
