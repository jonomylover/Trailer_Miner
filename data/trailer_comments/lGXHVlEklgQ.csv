When I saw the official announcement that they were working on it, it was even more of a thrill and such an anticipation. Looking at the trailer however has unfortunately gave me a sense of worries. The plot seems solid, but the bits and pieces seem less than what I would of thought or expected. I think I -just like many others- might just be comparing it to the original, which of course you can never duplicate an original, only thing you can do is make it as best as possible. It just seems like the sequal is more scripted and forceful than the first film. The original of course all characters fit like a glove and it feels like I'm watching the unscripted talents of 2 best friends naturally playing the role. Then again it might be a little absurd me going on a rant and jumping to conclusion on the sequal from a 2 and a half minute trailer. I know I'll be there at the midnight movie premier for this flick,  I just really hope it doesn't disappoint. ",0,0,insanevictor,lGXHVlEklgQ,0.20014367816091952,2014-06-11 12:02:00,True,True

Lloyd isn't stupid enough to casually think he's talking to his dead dad. He traveled hundreds of miles and tracked down one girl successfully and now this? The phone scene needs a better script for sure. Also it's really stupid that Lloyd has a catheter or however it's spelled. And then for harry to tank it out like that? C'mon, I know he's dumb but he was never THAT dumb in the first movie. And the ""THAT'S...AWESOME!"" Line sounds so stupid. They're trying to recreate the ""and totally redeem yourself!"" gag from the first film but it isn't nearly as funny. This is probably the most negative comment on here but I've been waiting so long for this sequel because the original is my favorite comedy movie ever and my second favorite movie ever made. So this is really really disappointing to see. Of course you guys can't judge it by the trailer so I'm still excited. What people don't realize is the original trailer for the original dumb and dumber made the movie look horrible as well! Some scenes in that trailer were either completely different or completely removed from the final cut. So my hopes are still high that they will make some necessary changes to the editing.

Eddie just needs to get back to the raunchy or more mature comedies. Tower Heist reminded us that Eddie is needed most in those type of roles. I guess that's why he's making Beverly Hills Cop 4.

2014-06-12T21:01:05,"Jim Carrey wears an inverted red triangle on a superhero suit at 1:29. the inverted red triangle was a symbol used as a badge in nazi concentration camps to identify political prisoners. there are mysterious red triangle/rectangles painted on houses in Florida (Universal studios hq is in Florida). there were sightings of a ufo with three red lights forming a triangle in Jacksonville Florida. the logo is also used for family planning in developing countries, its a shark-infested Pacific Ocean region off the northern California coast, and has numerous other meanings. according to google, ""Red is the color of fire and blood, so it is associated with energy, war, danger, strength, power, determination as well as passion, desire, and love. Red is a very emotionally intense color"". the triangle shape can mean the holy trinity, a ""love triangle"", a summoning symbol used by occultists, and it can symbolize masculinity and femininity (pointed up=male, pointed down=female). obviously there is a lot of meanings to the triangle shape... so why is Jim Carrey wearing this symbol? does it symbolize man being feminized in today's culture? does the color red reflect his passion for females? why this symbol in particular? is it just coincidence? is it an inverted red triangle put there in place of a superman logo (to avoid copyright infringement)? I am thinking that there is a significance to the color red. The production company was ""red granite"" pictures, using a red enso for the logo. universal studios is allegedly an illuminati company, along with new (blood) line cinema. It is common for both these production companies to insert masonic/illuminati/pagan/wiccan/etc symbolism in their movies (hidden in plain sight) the use of this symbol in this trailer is suspect. Perhaps the inverted triangle symbolizes inverted morals. Jim Carrey's character was accused of having a crush on Jeff Daniel's character's daughter. The powers that be are using media to make pedophilia accepted in culture. Look no further than what they did to miley cyrus and other stars that came before her. No doubt that this movie will glorify moronic behavior, (and a good mindless laughs can feel good), but who knows what images and narratives these companies are using to infiltrate our subconscious mind? Also, in the beginning of the trailer, Jim Carrey's character has been acting like an invalid for over twenty years to prank his friend. The scenario my be slightly humorous in a fictional context, but in the real world- losing twenty years of your life... wasted potential... this is very sad. Jim Carrey's character in ""burt wonderstone"" had a piece of his brain cut out. that's permanent damage. Hollywood is pushing trauma as comedy. Just look at how family guy makes fun of people dying all the time. I am convinced that the ""powers that be"" do not have the well-being of people in their hearts and minds. We are living in a progressively godless world, no thanks to private bankers (those who run the ""federal"" reserve) that own the world (rothschilds). To them the world is nothing but a big experiment, and they want to test dangerous pharmaceuticals on our kids, poison us and make us dumb with flouride in our water, tell us blatant lies with propaganda..... Universal studios and new line cinema are suspect, so why pay them to impregnate your mind with subversive messages, where you have no idea what kind of thought patterns they are going to give you? no idea is completely original. you get them from somewhere.... so propaganda is a socializing agent, and can help justify wars and who knows what else in the public perception. Hollywood is far-reaching. ",0,1,Dreamcast 84,lGXHVlEklgQ,0.025820384972170676,2014-06-12 21:01:05,True,True

It looks like two guys are trying to make some prank versions of Harry and Lloyd. So much over acting. I just hope that the movie is nothing like it. Seems like Daniels doesnt remember how to do comedy anymore, Harry ain't shouting and laughing all the time in the first movie but in this trailer it is all that he does. And I wont even say what I think about Carrey's lines. The original movie for me was all about the stupid little conversations, weird faces and hilarious but subtle road trip. Now its so off the top that it is embarrassing. There is a tiny chance that the trailer gives a wrong impression and the final movie will kick ass, but I doubt it considering the trash the directors have put out in last years.",1,0,Kalle Hämäläinen,lGXHVlEklgQ,-0.0052083333333333235,2014-06-15 20:53:43,True,True

Also, neither actor ""played"" dumb...the script made them dumb.  They were sort of blissfully unaware of their dumbness, and--on top of that--the rest of the characters were only marginally aware of Harry and Lloyd's true dumbness or they thought more along the lines of ""they must be kidding, right?""...for instance, Marry Swanson had a genuinely good time with Harry.  The problem with this trailer, at least, is that the joke is on the characters as opposed to being on their circumstances.  But, just my opinion. ",0,0,thewrman,lGXHVlEklgQ,0.18347338935574228,2014-06-26 00:02:50,True,True

In the bathtub in the first one he says; if you had a pair of knockers I'd bang you right now.  Then Lloyd says; how long do you have to wait until you can have sex after the operation.  IM SURE THEY KNEW WHAT SEX WAS.  POOR WRITING.....  THIS MOVIE WAS SO DIFFERENT.  THE FIRST ONE WAS MUCH BETTER.  I WISH I HAD NEVER SEEN THE SEQUEL.  ",0,0,Spade001,lGXHVlEklgQ,0.12175324675324677,2014-11-24 03:11:56,False,True

After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was hesitant on buying the movie because of the negativity, but I'm glad I have a mind of my own and bought it anyway. The movie really had some funny parts to it, especially when they find their old van and jump it like in the original, only to have it fall apart. The behind-the-scenes footage on the DVD was pretty cool, the sheep van was actually from the original movie; it had moss growing on it because it sat outside for the better part of 20 years. Not the best comedy of the year, but well worth watching.
