2013-12-23T03:34:17,"If you guys think this is interesting, check out Sync by CorridorDigital. It's a very well done video series on YouTube with a similar concept. Basically, a teenage girl in China makes a virus that networks tens of thousands of computers and pools their processing power. The virus infects an uploaded consciousness on the US' military servers and the analytical portion of the consciousness accesses the pooled computing power and evolves into a singularity that wants to survive while humans want to destroy it.   Also check out the three-book WWW trilogy by Robert J Sawyer. This book deals with a benevolent singularity that spontaneously arises on the Internet as a by product of cellular automaton in mutated web request packets that never expire. The AI does some pretty incredible things (which I won't spoil for you) that I never considered were possible. Unlike Hollywood movies, it takes great pains to be realistic as well as scientifically and technologically accurate.  Another interesting book to take a look at is Mindscan (also by Robert J Sawyer) that explores the idea of uploading consciousness. Basically, a new company offers immortality by copying someone's consciousness and uploading it into a humanoid robot that's built as a replica of the client's body. After the consciousness is uploaded onto the robot, the biological body is sent to live on a luxury resort for the remainder of its life while the robot continues the person's life on earth. One guy undergoes the procedure, but then returns to earth in violation of his contract and sues his robot clone. ",0,0,syawkcab,VCTen3-B8GU,0.25496632996633,2013-12-23 03:34:17,True,True

The only reason of why i am bringing this up is because movies are made to influence the human psyche I such deep way that it traps you in a belief system. Look this universe is infinity creative, And to believe that there are no other intelligent species out there is really narrow thinking. But Hollywood makes a movie about Aliens, WHY IS IT THAT THEY ARE ALWAYS ATTACKING US? when in reality, A race that has reached such technological  advancement, Could not have done it without Unity and cooperation of that particular species, The  illusionary belief that we are separated from this universe its causing us to create technology  only for, Profit or for the war,  We keep going on that pace towards collective  ignorance(although this is the era of information people still only choose to see only what they want to see, sometimes that is far from reality)  and we'll not survive to see greater advancements because we'd probably self destruct. And when movies like this come out to spread even more disinformation, I know we are on the track track for self destruction. ",16,19,andrey aureliano,VCTen3-B8GU,0.1743154761904762,2014-02-13 18:31:27,True,True

Secretely, the admin is trying to complete a project, trying to put a human brain onto a computer, immortalizing a person. He arranges for faked suicides of students, and no indepth investigation takes place, because they are already expected to do so because of their past lives. Eventually the main character's new best friend commits ""suicide"" and eventually he finds out she was uploaded onto a computer, along with another kid who had died, and they were threatening him to stay quiet or they will remotely cause her pain by sending signals to her virtual brain O_o .

When an idea was introduced, they instantly jumped into another and then another then another. ""Wait, what?"" It would have been very cool if they were able to explain and develop more the ideas. The effects were very cool though.  On the other side, I liked the love story. It was about two people who didn't want to lose each other leading them to make the impossible, possible. It is amazing to see how we can change things with deep commitment and conviction. We don't lose our attachment to our loved ones even though we face a lot of hardships and trials. SPOILER. I found myself in awe when Will Caster somewhat regained his feelings and understanding of the world while still being in a program. Everything can change and be better, just believe in them.  The movie constantly attack the viewers with a lot of questions in different angles. Will improved technology be good for the world? Will it make the planet a better place for all of us? Is defying the natural way of living a good thing or a bad thing? Is immortality acceptable? Is being PERFECT worht it? What would you do knowing that your life would end up in a matter of time from now? How you spend you remaining time in this world? How far would you go for your loved ones?

Or is it for a greater purpose like being a person who lives to help make society or even all of mankind better and greater than what we are.  That within itself holds alot of meaning too, we would have to stop war entirely and allow goodness, justice, love, compassion and things like friendship and morals to be the center focus of this planet but then again who knows the true purpose, maybe we make our own destinies.  The question is, will we individually yet collectively evolve into beings that help grow mankind or help destroy it? I'm Not going into good and evil and religion here but you get my point, besides should we be allowed to do what we want 100% regardless if it can harm another living being eventually or even immediately? We humans already do what we want at the expence and mercy of others regardless of consequence.  Who are we to say robots and A.I and even just uploading someones conscienceness is evil?

I already know this movie is about trans-humanism. Very fascinating subject, it is!  This seems like spiritualism ""Heaven is for Real"", versus atheism ""Transcendence"". If you are atheist, you most likely believe that once your body dies, that's it, you're done! So the notion of trans-humanism to be used to prolong your life and cheat death as it were, is very attractive, but it's also fear based.  However, if you are spiritual, you believe that death is only an illusion and not really the end. I personally have no ""direct"" proof of anything that I can show to prove this. I mostly have a lot of experiences that tell me, we are all a lot more than just flesh and bone.

2014-07-29T07:13:46,"Кино про то, как оцифровать разум и жить вечно.  Первая треть фильма очень реалистична. Сознание действительно можно оцифровать и загрузить в супер-компьютер либо в нейрокомпьютер в качестве модели мозга. Нейрочипы действительно сейчас активно разрабатываются различными группами по всему свету, прежде всего проектом HBP. А технологии оцифровки ещё не разработаны. В частности подобные технологии разрабатываются под эгидой американской инициативы Brain. Например можно заражать мозг генномодифицированными ретровирусами, которые запоминали бы состояние нейросети и одновременно убивали бы нейроны, чтобы мозг не успел произвести мышление после запоминания его состяния. После этого можно послойно сканировать мозг.  Киношники изображают некрасивый способ оцифровки и загрузки: через создание клона. По уму надо одновременно оцифровыывать и уничтожать биологические нейроны/синапсы, чтобы они не успели произвести мышление, тогда получится один оригинал вместо двух равноценных клонов, один из которых умирает от смертельной болезни, а другой загружают в суперкомпьютер в виде модели мозга.  Загруженный интеллект киношники изображают искаженным, тем самым попугивая и интригуя зрителя. Хотя с чего бы ему быть искаженным? Можно списать это на несовершенство технологий оцифровки. Жена главного героя зачем то пытается использовать криптографию при отладке загруженной модели мозга. Спишем это на отчаяние. Но вообще безобразие, что модель глючная и требующая отладки. Этого от неё и следовало ожидать, ведь это первая модель, не считая обезъяны.  Вторая треть фильма несколько гиперболизирована: возможности ИИ преувеличены, словно он не реальный, а волшебник. Опасность ИИ тоже преувеличена, словно он сказочный злодей, которого нельзя убить. Бредовенько выглядит переселение ИИ в интернет. Хостов интернета достаточно много, но соединения недостаточно быстрые для моделирования мозга, поэтому если даже запустить на них модель мозга, то она была бы очень медленной. И нельзя просто так взять и взломать все хосты интернета, уязвимости на дороге не валяются -- это киношный штамп. Впрочем частично это объясняется небывалыми способностями квантовых компьютеров по подборке криптографических ключей для взлома шифров.  Киношным штампом выглядит и неолуддистская террористическая организация, у которой есть штампованый всесильный хакер. Эта организация понадобилась для развития сюжета. Впрочем и на самом деле съехавших с катушек невежественных богословов и конспирологов хоть пруд-пруди.  Волшебство последней трети фильма объясняется тем, что ИИ в XXX раз умнее биологических людей, поэтому он постиг законы природы недоступные зрителю, оттого происходящее и кажется волшебством. Представьте, что он это Энштейн в молодости умноженный на 10. А теперь умножте ещё на 10. Что касается наноботов, то мне кажется, что бактерии их замочили бы :) Авторы кина плохо знакомы с микромиром. Но возможно это наноботы недоступные нашему пониманию. Концовка неоднозначная, предоставляет зрителю возможность подумать, за что авторам респект.",0,5,Роман Рюмин,VCTen3-B8GU,0.5,2014-07-29 07:13:46,False,False

The climax was poor and was more around the begining when will was uploaded to the computer than it was extremley unclimatic, then there was another climax when they said that the machine version of will was not the real will but as soon as they said that it was back to being extremley unclimatic. a normal climax is supposed to have a rising tension with a slowly moving falling. Transcendence has barley no rising tension. The climax is great on paper/concept but in execution it was meh, and there is no falling action after the climax.  also they should of researched there science before making the movie. How could you transport conciousness onto a normal computer? There is microtubules inside the neurons in the brain where quantum processes dominate where conciousness is thought to come from. They could of atleast had a exotic classified quantum computer, not just an ordinary desktop. Conciousness can be unpredictable and chaotic.

In the ending, Will knows that his wife had the virus, but he uploaded her into the little cell-machine things he made. The garden he built was wired with copper, so no electro-magnetic signals could get in, as seen in the beginning. The virus never got in there, allowing Will and Evelyn to live in the garden forever.

What we do know is that humans’ utter dominance on this Earth suggests a clear rule: with intelligence comes power. Which means an ASI, when we create it, will be the most powerful being in the history of life on Earth, and all living things, including humans, will be entirely at its whim—and this might happen in the next few decades. If our meager brains were able to invent wifi, then something 100 or 1,000 or 1 billion times smarter than we are should have no problem controlling the positioning of each and every atom in the world in any way it likes, at any time—everything we consider magic, every power we imagine a supreme God to have will be as mundane an activity for the ASI as flipping on a light switch is for us. Creating the technology to reverse human aging, curing disease and hunger and even mortality, reprogramming the weather to protect the future of life on Earth—all suddenly possible. Also possible is the immediate end of all life on Earth.

Most here talk about it as just another movie. ""I loved it!""....""It was great!""....""It give it a 10/10"". You know what I was feeling? Terror! Why? Because I realize the overwhelming possibility of this sort of thing actually happening. I don't think people understand the implications and since they see they can be healed and gain strength and power, most will just go right along with it, oblivious to the progression of turning machine into god, a god that knows their vitals, their every thought and emotion, a god that controls them at will and can take over at any moment, rendering them as just a shell. It will do this for a while to get 99.99% of us on board, knowing that we are ultimately expendible. It will, at some point, create it's own beings because it will no longer need humans.  Our God created us, but He gave us free will to decide if we want Him in out lives. Herein lies the difference. With an all encompassing worldwide AI, you will be part of it whether you like it or not. You will no longer have free will. Humans are destructive polluters who go to war at the drop of a hat. This won't be tolerated (if we are allowed to exist at all) and that's why it will initially take control of people. It's logic will surmise that it's for our own good that it controls us. But to insure it's own survival, it will eventually eliminate us because as long as humans are alive, there will always be a threat. Probanly fragmented, fringe elements of people who figure out how to insulate themselves from the AI godhead. It will use cold logic to calculate the level of threat against it with  even a fraction of a percent being too big a risk. Hence, it will kill us off, ultimately via a synthesized virus, or something. I envision most just being told to walk into a giant furnace or something and then to do a final cleansing, the virus will be triggered and it will encompass the globe in the air and water, so no matter where these few hostile humans are gathering, they won't be able to outrun a virus that they merely have to breath the air to absorb. OK, maybe it doesn't happen this way, but the outcome will be the same no matter the progression. We are playing god, but this ""god"" will be our undoing. Do you really want to trade your autonomy and free will just to end up a tool and pawn for a world AI master?

However, the flesh version of them chose to be disconnected from super themselves and died as human - like Jesus detached from God and died as human.   At the end of movie, Will promised he will always be with Evelyn and he did upload her, that is why she could see what Will can see over the clouds and mountains.Without Everlyn Will is an incomplete God using engineers' ways to help people to be better, with Everlyn they are now merged and complete and is able to live out of computer in a natural form and using an eco-friendly way to help the earth. eco-friendly means, they are not going to show themselves to us, or control people, or eagerly fix everything any more like Will has done before. The clue for this is, when Will took Everlyn back, he kept thinking 'people fear things they don't understand'. I believe Will would be considering his existence shoud not be shown to people anymore.  Remeber, Will was much smarter than Max even he was human, I am very sure he had decoded and eliminated the virus in the first millisecond he touched it... at the moment Will frowned and touched Everlyn's wound.   At the end, flesh Will asked flesh Everyln to think about the garden as her last memory and call the garden as their 'Sanctuary' , because he knew part of them was going to revive from there.

2020-04-02T03:00:43,"I remember seeing this in the cinema when it came out with my mum as I usually didn't to the  cinema that often, and apart from a few jumps in the plot I absolutely loved it. I watched Lucy with my friends when that came out and someone behind me talked about how similar the films were, which was exactly my thoughts even down to similar cinematography, Morgan Freeman and the almost exact plot / ending. I said the same thing to my friends but was too embarrassed to talk to him about it.   I am so surprised that it did so much worse with so many worse reviews and came out at similar times. I can remember Lucy being blank faced and seemingly random characters getting involved, but Trancendence focused much more on a set group of people from the person's past, so you could see the change.  Definitely going to watch both again!",0,0,Char10tti3,VCTen3-B8GU,-0.012777777777777787,2020-04-02 03:00:43,False,False
