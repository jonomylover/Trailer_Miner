Just suck it up, stop judging the others to make yourself feel better and accept yourself. ^^   Now for those bitching about the movie...sigh. You're often have to attract a wider audience with a movie, which is why the studios end up changing the plot to suit a wider taste.   Besides the fact that they don't have enough time to put in all the details, they also try to please everyone, which means sacrificing plot integrity. With a movie, studios often decide that they don't have the time to make relationships confusing if that is not the very main focus, so they make the end-pairing as obvious as possible. In a movie, they also try to make the characters more likeable as well to attract moviegoers.   That is probably why the sex scenes right at the beginning was taken out; otherwise, some people might think Bianca was a b*tch to lead him on the way she did.

Now the real ""duff""  storyline will never be seen in movie theaters bc some dumb Hollywood producers wanted to make money off of yet another dumb ""no bullying"" ""chick flick."" It's hilarious how Hollywood has no new and interesting stories coming out and when they finally decided to make a movie based off of an original and interesting storyline, they change it to be unoriginal and predictable. I understand that if they had stuck to the books original storyline that would have caused the movie to probably be less family family friendly and less pre-teen friendly, but come on Hollywood GROW SOME BALLS. Stop trying to make another Mean Girls. In fact Mean Girls and ""easy A"" were success BECAUSE they weren't afraid of being more honest and raunchy.
