The wildlife generally looks okay from an ecological point of view -- CGI isn't bad but it's clearly CGI; hopefully that gets improved between now and the release -- though the presence of an out-of-geological-place long-tailed sabertooth cat is a glaring flaw as someone familiar with paleontology and Ice Age megafauna.

2017-07-20T20:29:37,"If you think this looks good, you should check out the ""Earth's Children"" series of books by Jean Auel, also about prehistoric people.  I'm surprised no one has mentioned it here, this movie looks similar.  The first book, ""the Clan of the Cave Bear"" is an entertaining and truly original book which was made into a HORRIBLE movie in the 1980s (or 1990s?).  I hope this movie does a better job!  Those modern-looking bison (in Europe?) worry me.  Also, why do people slam it because the characters speak English?  What do you expect?  Of course no one spoke English back then (DUH), but would you go see a movie if you couldn't understand the dialog?  If I saw a picture about the life of Jesus I would not expect the actors to speak Aramaic.  Should we slam Shakespeare because he had Julius Caesar speaking English?  No one is going to make a movie that the audience can't understand.  By that logic, Hollywood could never make a movie set in a non-English speaking setting.",0,0,Bert Rubini,uIxnTi4GmCo,0.09615384615384613,2017-07-20 20:29:37,True,True

The legend takes its name from the Central Asian valley in which fleeing Gokturks sought refuge and a new homeland. Their empire had been destroyed as a result of battles with Chinese and other non-Turkic forces. They fled into a forbidding mountainous region and at its center came across an enormous fruitful valley. They decided to remain there and, melting down all of their iron tools and weapons, created an enormous iron door to seal the only entrance to the valley. Here they lived in peace and the clans flourished and became powerful again. After many generations, they became so numerous that the valley became overpopulated. They decided to melt down the iron door to forge weapons.  However, no one remained of the generation that had led them through the passes, valleys and ravines into the valley, so they wandered aimlessly through the mountains until a gray mother wolf (the symbol on the Gokturk coat of arms) appeared and led them out of the mountains. On the steppes, after many battles, the Gokturk won back their importance, although they never regained their old unity and rather split into many tribes that nevertheless traced their communal origins back to the Gokturk.",0,0,God of F.,uIxnTi4GmCo,0.07896065922381712,2017-09-05 07:58:11,True,True

It is good to see some people trying to make some shows, movies etc. out of the picture that we fed up and feel sick of it, just like Avengers etc. half monster Marvel hero and/or  some robotic hyper space age so called futuristic new age human life movies (While human probably return back to the times as it show in this movie during next 50 to 200 years!).  I wish some one try to make the story of the book series (By writer Nihal Atsıiz) ""Death of the Gray Wolves"" and fallowing series of the book ""Birth (or rise/resurrection) of the Gray Wolves"". Story of a captive Prince and 39 (Kind of Knights from Royal families) loyal elite soldiers those spends years in China as a captive leaders/royals, even had to serve in many battles on the name of China and become legend in self in then imperial army, finally revolts (Coup) against to China, capture the whole place but not the Chinese emperor, finally corner him in a open field but surrounded by whole Chinese army, which starts a battle 40 against all for that takes days and thousands of lose and devastation before being able to stop that small pack of wolves.   Chinese history literally mentions the prince and his small royal/loyal soldiers, their coup attempt, battle etc. Not mentioning anything about the casualties of course. Which means; it is quite real historic event indeed, turned into a story approximately 1500 years later with a legendary story expression.

The filmmakers were obviously aware of this, as the lead actor - Kodi Smit-McPhee - is a blue-eyed white Australian, and they've given him contacts and tanned skin. Personally, I'm still going to see the film, as it looks amazing and Smit-McPhee is a talented actor.

2017-12-16T09:51:23,"Ugh the ignorance on this thread is so annoying. It’s debated when anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa but when they did they found they weren’t the first people to do so. 500,000 ya I think various species of the genus homo, mostly Homo erectus, I think, followed migration paths north and into Europe. Then these people evolved separate of those who stayed in Africa. These people evolved bigger and lighter skinned. These people fought harder for survival and had less free time and developed fewer traits unnecessary for survival such as art, music, and personal expression like their contemporaries in Africa. These people were called the Neanderthals. The lived in Europe when the first anatomically modern humans arrived. These two separate people lived side by side for thousands of years until eventually the Neanderthals died out due to low birth rates and mostly interbreeding with humans, 40,000 ya. Most every European has a good amount of Neanderthal dna in them. Their skin at this time would be lighter. Humans breed very fast compared to Neanderthals. There were relatively few of them compared to Homo sapiens. 20,000 years later is enough time for the Neanderthals dna to become muted and washed out. But it would have left relatively surface changes such as skin color.   There’s some ancient anthropology 101",0,0,Rachel Dunford,uIxnTi4GmCo,0.07386904761904763,2017-12-16 09:51:23,True,True

They were starving and our 'morning's walk' to relieve ourselves offered them easy food.  3. They are social animals and so are we.

The both of us got used to one another and it wouldn't have been long before we socialised with one another, and from that they became our pets.

2018-08-16T16:50:20,"Being both a serious dog lover and a serious wolf lover I must say that I cannot wait to see this movie. I have heard people ask did dogs train human beings or did human beings train dogs. I believe that human beings and dogs trained each other. Dogs helped train man by helping them develop the senses and skills to sense, recognize, and combat dangers in the world as well as hunt for food and humanity trained dogs how to be a companion where they could work together and help each other. Dogs helped the human beings protect their safety and food and in return the human beings shared the food with them, gave them warmth of fire, and protection from enemies that dogs could not handle by using their weapons and providing strength in numbers. This is why the partnership between humanity and dogs has lasted for so long because both sides know they need each other. This is also why dogs are submissive to their human being masters and respect them as the masters and leaders because they know human beings have the power to enforce their will with their advanced brains, minds, and tools that dogs know they do not have or are unable to use. They know human beings can use tools and get what they want so it is better to submit to them and work with them rather than resist and get hurt and possibly even killed and then be forced to obey anyway. I have also heard from the comments of other users who ends of being the true Alpha in the movie: Keda, the character of Kodi Smit-McPhee, or the Chuck the Wolfdog. Yes the Wolfdog who plays in the movie has been named. I believe that it will turn out that they end up working together as a team where both consider the other an equal and neither is the Alpha. But if I had to pick one or the other I would say Keda since human beings have the brains, minds, and tools that make them the dominate species on the planet. I believe that all animals like wolves can sense that human beings are dominate over them in terms of power and that would make Chuck in the movie willing to submit to Keda as leader. That is the process of domestication. Wild animals do not submit to us but domesticated animals who have bonded with us do. Part of bonded with us is that they accept us as the masters and those who are the masters are also the leaders, at least usually. Finally many users have commented that Chuck will probably die before the end of the movie. Although that is definitely possible I think there could be another solution. I believe that Chuck finds a mate and breeds with her, then their puppies become the first little adopted by humanity that starts the selective breeding process leading to the creation of the dog. I guess we will all find out one way or the other by actually watching the movie. To all of you who plan to watch the movie I hope that you greatly enjoy it as much as I do and for those of you who plan not to watch it I can and will respect that. I just ask that you please respect me for choosing to watch it in return.",0,0,ALPHA000102,uIxnTi4GmCo,-0.003399122807017545,2018-08-16 16:50:20,False,True

This is first time i have seen the white male leadcast (Kodi Mcphee) in tanned skin color. Tbh, Kodi looks perfect as it the skin color effect creates more exotic vibes which fits Keda, the son of the leader in his tribe.  Typically i have seen lots of movie boy/dog but boy/wolf is entirely new. And i can assure you Alpha aint any common typical pet movie you have ever seen. It's about a chronicle  of young man, Keda who forms an unlikely alliance with a savage wolf and how the two different species alliance slowly evolving as the plot thickens.
