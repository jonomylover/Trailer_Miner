This movie looks like trash but there are alot of good moments I like from this movie because it's addams family, I've always loved how the family members always interact with all kinds of normal people and just get them all traumatised. The whole goody two shoes and up beat music is so annoying to hear all the time and the animation looks like I'm watching a sony animation movie.   Because of trailers and movies always sticking to a more formular style of soundtracks, story, art direction and trailer cliche's it does ruin a movie/series unique style just for the sake of appeal to a massive modern audience because a movie is familiar to them in some way and I'm sure alot of these people are sick of this and will just think negative of any media that does this. But honestly I do find it hilarious seeing Snoop Dogg playing as Cousin It.   Most of the things I'm saying are speculation but... this movie could be bad, or good. The trailer does nail the cartoonish edge of the addams family... but this is a trailer after all... they may only show the good parts of the movie and the rest of it might be a disappointment.

2019-08-08T22:17:43,"Clearly the character design is directly influenced by the original Charles Addams comics, instead of trying to imitate the TV show or movies. I don't really see why it needs to be Tim Burton-ized, like some people are suggesting, and we don't need Johnny Depp as Gomez (I could see that happening). No offense, I like both of them. I'll bet Burton would probably approve of the character design, because he surely must be a Charles Addams fan.   That being said, I'm not sure what to think of this yet. Hollywood has a  way of ruining things like this. Cool niche things that have gained classic cult status. I grew up watching the old TV show, and I'm kind of partial to that (Jackie Coogan ruled), but the movies were enjoyable, despite some minor flaws. Maybe there's some good stuff in this. I can even live with Snoop Dogg as Cousin Itt. He's okay, I suppose, and Itt doesn't talk. How bad can it be? At least it's not Ryan Reynolds (Pikachu? Really?) making snarky remarks. As for the music, it's a trailer. How much of it will actually be in the movie?    If I have one real complaint, it would be Pugsley eating his grandmother's ""toe cheese"". I don't think that's Addams Family style humor, that's 21st century Hollywood cheap gross out humor. Okay in a ""South Park""  episode, but not in the Addams Family. I hope they don't rely too much on that kind of gag.   Sorry for the rant folks! If you read this far, my hat's off to you. BTW, If you've never seen or read any of the original Charles Addams comics, and you're an Addams Family fan, you should check them out.",0,0,Izk68,F7Ug863S8dQ,0.14283968719452592,2019-08-08 22:17:43,True,True

I'm not very far in, nor have I been watching for long, but I can tell something's off just by looking at the trailer-  Something tells me it's going to be a bit like RWBY V6 where the first part is amazing, but it declines over time- the one thing i'm worried about the most is the soundtrack.   I get it's cheaper to work off songs that already exist since you only have to pay for rights, but honestly I wish this movie had something a little bit more like Lemon Demon sounding (see: Spirit Phone, the perfect mix between pop songs and terrifying topics if you ask me) since the movie's premise seems to be the clash between The Addams' family and the world surrounding them (like the 60s, just animated and modernized) and.. god, i'm worried this movie is going to give the Family a bad look.

2020-01-18T09:15:13,"Coming back from actually watching the movie, all I can say was this was a big mess on the animation front and the story front.  Most if not all of the ""normal"" characters looked anorexic. Their arms and legs look like they'll break at the slightest movement. Parker and her friends have literally no personality whatsoever. And her two friends only show up once in the entire film and then ""poof"" gone. The blonde haired girl was the typical ""popular bully"" character, but she was shallower than kiddie wading pool.   The one scene that seemed to be in every trailer for this movie was the crossbow scene, where Wednesday shoots arrows at Fester. This happens while she's talking to Parker for the first time. The first two arrows hit Fester's body while he's looking in the mirror. You can clearly see them poking out and the mirror is large enough for Fester to see them sticking out of his back. HOWEVER, THE ANIMATION DOES NOT SHOW THE ARROWS ON FESTER'S BACK IN THE MIRROR. The reflection on the mirror doesn't show the arrows until the part when the final arrow goes through one ear and out the other. THAT WAS SO LAZY.  Wednesday had so many out of character moments. I know this was somewhat of a ""new approach"" but it felt like the people behind the movie have never seen the previous Addams Family movies, the TV show, or read the comics. I will specify, Wednesday would never EVER be caught dead in pink. If it were a light color like yellow, perhaps. But NEVER pink. And she would never distance herself from her family purposefully. Wednesday cares about and loves her family too much to ever abandon them like she did in this movie.  The resolution of the movie was awful as well. The background characters are such sheep, in which they follow the main antagonist and destroy the Addams Family property. They don't even apologize when they realize what they were doing was wrong. Instead they ""offer to rebuild the home"" and they color it, you guessed it PINK.  UGH.
