Even in the trailer you can feel something is off, but there were some cool lines in it, and he is avenging a dog (how awesome is that?) and you think maybe this would be better than in trailer? Very badly acted (swedish guy was dreadful), uneven tone (scenes in hotel), shootouts like in some shit comicbook franchise with neverending clips of bullets, all of them around our hero and nothing touches him, and most of all very bad fights, not even close to Taken or Bourne, and even worse than those in Equalizer (fight/shootout between Keanu and chick from hotel was most painfull to watch). Probably that was the idea, lets make a comicbook movie with a guy without the  powers.

I always felt partly why the 1st one worked, was how ""self-contained"" and ""restrained"" everything was, to choreography/story and acting.   2. If they are gonna make this some kinda saga(which it kinda looks like), I hope they keep it to 3 films. Films like these are character driven (John Wick himself), so I hope they don't overdo it a 100 sequels, and destroy the mystery of his character. :/This has happened to too many iconic characters (Freddy Kruger, Jason, Neo etc...)

At the beginning, he just fights his way to take back his car loudly like a brute, causing too much unnecessary disturbance (he doesn't need to act like a ninja though). And it's strange that no fucking police come to join the party. Also that rushing into rooms without caution of being back-stabbed, and also after being crashed by the car in the legs, he just stands up and do goon'thing like there's nothing (ROFL metal legs).  Then, that awkward walking to the hotel and requesting to talk with the old guy, only to learn that rejecting the old agency's rules is stupid. (LMAO)  Our so-called John wick walks back into his old agency just to beg them to accept him again lol. This makes me feel he's like a kid learning how to behave.  And the final push, for those who take killing as their job, after being assigned with a contract, is it worth asking the client why?  Trash movie only made for kids and childish tards.

But it's to keep the action going (and it DOES!) What I liked - The action is going, going. But never gone.  If you just like shoot shoot blam slam kill kill. Oh and punching, kicking, and hitting people with cars, SEE THIS MOVIE. Mild gore. The movie specializes in breathtaking, almost nonstop, action of violent nature. I've seen it elsewhere, and it's probably the same here.       ***** SPOILER*****    I don't actually know if you all would call this a happy ending or not. But it sure does for the most part, fix everything that needs fixing! Especially your shameful need to see violence and more violence.  It's not ""real"" but it sure feels real while you're watching it.  That's some God damn yummy violence there!
