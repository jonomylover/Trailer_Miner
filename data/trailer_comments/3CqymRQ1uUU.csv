Find the independent stuff, the stuff from foreign filmmakers etc. It's there, it just takes a bit of effort to see it. Remember Martin Scorsese's Hugo? That wasn't a film about fighting and war (despite World War 1) being mentioned a few times. And what about Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel? It does have some fighting in it, and gunfights, but ultimately that is not what it is about. There is also the French, Oscar-arwarded animated film The Illusionist. People just like these fighting things more, I guess, and honestly, it's NOT something new.
