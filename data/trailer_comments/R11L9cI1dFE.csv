2015-07-18T00:05:15,Looks absolutely awful! Females just aren't funny most of the time. There are exceptions of course like Amy Schumer. She's hilarious! But most suck. Look at Parks and Rec. A good show and technically a Tina Fey production but I bet had mostly male writers and the two most popular characters were Ron and Andy.
