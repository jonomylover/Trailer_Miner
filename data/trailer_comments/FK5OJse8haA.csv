Free education should be a no-brainer from an economi perspective, not to mention we would get to choose a superior and more ethical set of leaders from a larger pool of the 99% as opposed to the statistically sure-to-be dumber and less capable offspring of the 1% (i.e. George Bush, Jarod Kushner, Donald Trump, etc etc) .  The fraudulent reasons college is artificially expensive include corruption at (mainly our private) universities, collusion with banksters and college loan scam artists, and, worse of all,  blatant class warfare where the rich get to send their kids to college and poor can only send them into the military to get killed and wounded for oil interest.
