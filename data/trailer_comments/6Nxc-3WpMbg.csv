2017-04-25T06:26:00,"Historical note:  During the days of slavery, Southern elite in the United States had an ambition to annex several territories, such as Mexico, Central America, Venezuela, and Colombia to create new slave states, thus creating a ""Golden Circle"" around the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean.  This vast increase in the number of slave states would give indefinite power to the South, and was therefore naturally never given serious thought.    Is it related to this movie?  Doubtful, seeing as the Kingsmen (and therefore the Statesmen) were not created until the early 20th century.

In the trailer, Harry is wearing his eye band on the left eye, while one of Kingsman 2's poster that has Harry's glasses shows that lens on the right side is missing. There can be two different cases. First is that Harry wore an eye band in the past due to his recovering. Second is that Mr. Vaughn and his crew did not realize their mistake. If it is the second case, I sincerely wish for a favor from Mr. Vaughn, since I am the originator of a big news. Love Kingsman, Love all the actors, Love Mr. Vaughn!

Judging by this trailor, Kingsman 2 seems to be a joy ride (really, ""Statesman"" and ""Kingsman"", LOL!).    Mr. Vaugh is producing and directing ""I AM Pilgrim"" now.

2017-09-22T06:18:29,"I was extremely excited to see the new Kingsman movie and I rushed to the theater on opening night. I almost never do that. Of course, there were funny jokes and great fights, but I felt like this movie was made to serve the liquor industries propaganda over the rising use of marijuana. I am a personally no user of liquor or marijuana and I can clearly see the agenda being pushed from the liquor industry, as Halle Berry tells Channing Tatum - ""From now on, I suggest you stick with booze.""  I feel like the first movie was a lot purer from every angle than the second and just because it got a lot of admirations, I think some capital forces decided to join in on the party and sell their ideas of ""what's right and wrong"" by sponsoring the movie and having ""the lovely cast"" do some propaganda on their behalf, which I find disgusting.   The more I observe, the more I am convinced how Hollywood is just trying to push agendas from people with money and I am not talking about a simple product placement of cars, watches and etc. I am talking about some serious social issues that affect many and it seems that Hollywood's agenda is to continue to brainwash ""the zombies"" with lobbyist's propaganda.

The action itself was good considering this type of movie - no complains, but the level of cruelty... Overall thumbs down. If you intend to make an adult intended movie, at least have some decent sensual scenes, and keep the violence at some not very high level. Otherwise , just some random blood to underline how wicked some characters are... it shows lack of imagination.

My suspicions that those behind the original might have lost the plot were sadly confirmed. The original beauty of Kingsman. Its basic English base and style and the pace of the original has been lost. They might have had a plot where the Kingsmen had to operate in the USA but creating Statesmen and the often ludicrous situations and wasted storyline distractions that arose forced me to switch off after trying hard to stay with the movie beyond the final quarter.  Some doubtless love it but for me a movie crime has been committed and the main characters have been woefully wasted.,0,0,Kohl423,6Nxc-3WpMbg,0.006249999999999992,2018-02-10 21:36:05,False,False
