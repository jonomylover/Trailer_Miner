Since when are the Sixers (sux0rs, whatever) NASCAR drivers? There was never a giant car chase scene in the books.  Since when has there ever been an orc? There was no such character in the books.  Where's Art3mis, not even a single mention of her (not that I care, the romance in the books was kinda bad, imo).

I think I watched all the reactions and have watched and read everything I can find on the release. Here are a few things I have been able to figure out and a few corrections for people. (possible spoilers)  1. The Stacks look like anyone who read the book would have thought of it but the Stacks where in Oklahoma city in the book and he did not make it Columbus until after the first key is found. His hide out in the van is very accurate to the book also.   2. As Wade enters the oasis they show a scene of Og's birthday party. Many of the Easter eggs here have been covered.   3. The scene with the Iron Giant is 3 people in the book but everyone seems to get this part wrong. E.Cline confirmed on E that it was Diato, Shoto and Parzival. They also said the Iron Giant plays a larger role in the movie that I have two ideas because of some tribute to The iron Giant movie, this could be Diato. I could be wrong but that is my speculation.   3. The Delorien spinning out looked like the Planet he went to school on in my mind. This would be highly out of place because Wade did not have a car in the game until he had the cash to get some of the add ons in the game from sponsorship.   4. The scorpion and Joist part is strange. At first I thought it might be part of the end battle but I am starting to think they fully changed the first key challenge. This is 2045 after all and in VR. It would be a little weird to watch a kid playing a coin operated video game while a Lich watches him.   4. As the trailer moves to the Race scene, There is no race in the book and this is an adaptation that I am excited to see. Those of you who think it will be a clear recreation of the book are wrong. I would hate going to see this movie if that is all that it was. I fully expect to see the changes like Irok (TJ Miller) playing a very different and much more expanded role. There is no way to pack the whole story even into a 3 hour movie and as everyone says the books are always better than the movie.   5. The last parts I would point out is that we do see Artimas. She is riding Kenadas bike from Akira (ITS NOT A TRON LIGHT CYCLE). We also get to See Aech who is driving the truck. There is also a Scan code on one of the IOI cars that takes you to a IOI recruitment webpage.   6. There is one small Easter egg in the trailer that I am not seeing anyone talking about but I noticed one thing towards the end and very hard to catch. When Wade rips off his visor, you can see Nolan Sorento in the reflection. A few people noticed this but I think they missed it and it is not a reflection. I know I dropped a spoiler warning on my predictions but I do not want to drop this spoiler. What I will say is that I believe this is not a reflection but a delay from his visor and the look on Wades face and the fact that he is in his hide out can only be from one spot in the book. It is right after he logs out from his first meeting with Nolan and something big just happened. I highly doubt this is him being surprised after finding the first clue as others have suggested.   ¬†I would add that those not in the know should get a better feel from a longer trailer and I highly suspect the full trailer and not the teaser is going to have Halidays message in there and a more in depth look at the story line than the teaser. Those are my thoughts. Let me know if you guys think I am off on anything and sorry for the spelling and grammar errors.",0,0,James Elliott,dtwpjnuaVTE,0.05882227891156464,2017-07-29 21:15:45,True,True

So, I am interested in this movie. I know the music will be okay. Besides, John Williams is getting old. He is now 85. Wow! Sooner or later he will...pass. Back then, I did not care who did music of my favorite movies. I think some Music Composers are awesome. Anyway, this movie looks awesome. Besides, I don't see what's the difference with James Newton Howard with King Kong, with Peter Jackson. I still love Howard Shore better with Peter Jackson better than any other composer who teams up with Peter Jackson. I like King Kong a little, but I still wish Howars Shore would have done the music.
