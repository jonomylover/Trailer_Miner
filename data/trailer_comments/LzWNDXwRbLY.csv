A recurring theme is that supporting roles are now given to those who have become successful in careers that are not directly related to acting.  The reason being is that they bring their fan base to the movies, which is a profitable move for Hollywood, but is a detriment to many of those who are looking for an opportunity who's focus and passion is acting.
