Now we need to add in completely irreverent side stories, brother killing himself, love interest and random friends that further complicate things. Likewise in the mortgage business lets add in synthetic cdos because the original deals weren't lucrative enough.  Now we need an agency to rubber stamp the cdo so that we don't lose money.  Likewise we need advertisement hype machine saying this is an awesome movie so that it too doesn't lose money.  Now we need to make sure the buyer/viewer feels like they understand it. We'll lightly go over the smallest points so that they feel smart and important. Hot tub scene, casino scene  and interview with exec at restaurant to name a few.
