Also, there does not seem to be a good theme in this movie besides women are more than just workers. However, the way that this movie seems to be pitching the theme does not seem to be working. If anything this movie seems to be portraying these mothers to be wild when they are not working, which defeats the theme. This shows at the end when the little girl notices her parents screaming at night and continues to use the profanity she heard her mother speak. All of this is just my opinion though.
