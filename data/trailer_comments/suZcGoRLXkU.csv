Everyone has different imaginations, look at this as Robert's imagination of the book. The way he wants the movie to flow, is something Veronica has accepted and gave her consent to already.   My bet is that the box you all are hating against, is the hard drive they're fighting to get, containing Edith Prior's video and revelation of the past and how it all started. Why is it a box? Because this is an action movie for teenagers and young adults, so if you see it in a different perspective, they would like to make it have a unique appearance.   The most important thing is the plot, and how it should stay true to the book as much as possible. And if you pay close attention to every single detail of the trailer (appearance excluded), almost everything is there. The hard drive which caused it all, the brother being a traitor, Peter joining the Erudite, FourTris scenes, Christina's heartbreak when she finds out about the truth, and last but not least, the whole deal between Tris and Jeanine.   So try to be a little bit more open minded, guys. Divergent was already different from the book, so you can't really expect Insurgent to do the opposite, when it has so much more events going on.   PS: Edgar is NOT someone who will interfere FourTris' relationship in the movie. Veronica confirmed it herself during her booth in CCSD. So no, there's no love triangle when it comes to FourTris.

Because it has its moments (Tris, Caleb and Four leaving the Amity compound), (Evelyn as factionless leader and Johanna, they didn't cut them), (Eric's speech before he dies), (Marlene's death), (Christina completely sad about Tris killing Will), (the factualness look amazing), (Caleb's betrayal), (TRIS VS TRIS, fuck I wanted to see it so bad!!), (Jeanine experiments). It IS like the book in its ways, books do not work like movies. You are supposed to tell a 520 page book in 2h30min maximum.  Last thing: You can not judge something completely by the trailers. I mean, you saw Tris shooting a gun, but what if someone's in front of her and she can't shoot? You're seriously missing your point. For what I saw, they turned the series much more intense, mature and action-packed, this will make the series get recognition for the last movies, and you will care more about Tris. If you're not going to be supportive and help your book series adaptation become famous, please, stop bitching and hating about it.",3,0,M√°rio D.,suZcGoRLXkU,-0.02491883116883115,2014-12-13 10:02:40,True,True

2014-12-13T15:26:19,"So I found this comment on this news page, and i think the person who wrote it have a good explanation of what's up with that box: ""The box is simply a physical version of ""the information"" aka the Edith Prior video. In the video we find out that after a level of divergence reaches it's limit, the video must be revealed and those divergent must travel outside the fence to meet with the people who created this experiment. In the movie, the box will probably have some sort of tape inside or projection of the video, but to open this, someone with a level of divergence enough for 3 faction aptitudes must open it somehow, that's why Tris is ""the one"" and that's why there are other divergent people who appear in the trailer but didn't have the aptitude for 3 factions, only for two (the symbols that lit up), and couldn't open the box. This would make sense because the video would come just in time for that certain level of divergence to reach it's limits and for people to have to go outside the fence, also Tris mentions Jeanine has an IDEA of what's inside the box, so the only difference from the book to the movie is that in the book, Jeanine has watched the Edith Prior video, in the movie, she'll only have an idea of what it is.""

2014-12-13T20:38:20,"okay im here to give my opinion on the trailer, ive got to admit the trailer wasn't 100% true to the book but its not 100% not true to the book. They do include A LOT from what happened in the book but thats sadly being overlooked by the negative, The only parts that were wrong to me were  1. How she can shoot a gun with no problem, in the book shes not able to use a gun cause of will.  2. The odd box, BUT I THINK I HAVE A THEORY OF THE BOX! Since the box is something we see throughout the trailer it obvious has relevance in the movie, i think thats going to be the usb that tris gets and the edith prior information is kept on, i know what you guys are thinking ""how could that be the usb its huge"" it either might be the usb or contain the usb in it??   honestly other then that i don't see anything wrong, obviously they made certain things a lot more exaggerated then they were in divergent, for example the trains look a lot bigger and military grade, the factionless are located in a huge factory and the way the simulations are entered with (the wires)  In my opinion the wires were a lot cooler, im pretty sure the producers didn't want the old boring needle and fluid. They producers might have wanted to enhance everything in this movie to make it a bigger and better action packed movie.  I have faith in this movie and i love the series and am NOT giving up on this movie. If you think of it they are just improving the story line with alot more epic settings, a lot more action, and sure they change some things but they just replaced the changed things, not got rid of it completely.

But we all knew that something like this gonna happen if we want a really good movie.  The Box: Remember that when the video came up. Tris was arrested with most of Dauntless in the Erudite Center and Tobias said that he conviced Caleb to show the video of Edith Prior. So there's not a clue of how did they open the video. So it's up to director's imagination. And box thing is okay i think. Tris shooting: In the book, you can have much more details, but Tris'd shoot anyway so it's not a really big deal. It's kind of action movie. Tris had to shoot. Edgar: Guys there's no Edgar in the trailer. Don't go mad please. And Veronica said that there'll not be any love triangles. Don't be that nervous. Tobias and Tris Frickle Frackle: It's a Hollywood movie, they should have something that includes sexuality and action in every movie. It's the gold rule. Strong Factionless: I personally think that it doesn't seem that strong. It might look a little bigger than I've imagined but we didn't see the movie so we shouldn't complain about the look. Tris' Hair: She cut her hair for tfios and she should be blonde. She dyed her hair and made it a little shorter. It's not a big deal. I think the hair makes her look more stronger and more like a warior. Just the way Tobias said in Allegiant.",2,0,inan 8228,suZcGoRLXkU,0.16025641025641024,2014-12-13 22:03:57,True,True

My theory for the movie is: Jeanine got the box when she killed the abnegation, and that it contains the Edith prior information. Jeanine just doesn't know what the box holds, experimenting with divergents to open it, and then when Tris finally opens the box, Jeanine will view the information then attempt to destroy it, denying the info, however Tori will break into her lab and kill her in front of Tris before Jeanine has a chance to destroy it. Then it will just be shown like the end of the book.

For instance in the first movie tris was suppose to let Christina win the capture the flag game to make her less suspicious of being diverent. That is just one of the major things they did not have to change. I honestly thought after watching the first movie, hey maybe they will to better with the second movie, but from what I am seeing they are making it worse. If they where planning on changing the story this much they should have givin it a different name because this is not the divergent series.

Just watching the montage of action sequences starting from 1:11 am I the only one that feels Shailene Woodley was probably the wrong pick to play the main role? The CGI is bad enough, and to see her rendered physique in stunts is worse . For my standards she doesn't project an ounce of athleticism in her posture/stances, doesn't look right holding a gun, and the facial structure doesn't fool anyone.

2014-12-16T19:27:42,"Adaptations will always have changes from the original media. Some are justified, some do not make sense, others simply increase in number and magnitude the action scenes. I am already used to it and I can (sort of) have fun with book adaptations at the theaters. The big problem is when adaptation modifies the characters in itself. I'm not talking about the physical aspects but of their personality, their motivations. I liked the adaptation of Divergent. The book in itself is the best of the series, maybe that's why the changes have been superficial. The most significant, the change of fear simulations, changing somewhat the characteristic of the Dauntless (they seem more Erudites in the simulations, strategically thinking a way to escape the situation, no really related to bravery), but it was ""ok"". The trailer for Insurgent, suggests that this film certainly they changed the motivations of certain characters.  (A LOT OF SPOILERS AHEAD) The clearest example is Jeanine. In the books, she knows what is kept secret by Abnegation. Marcus suggests that he shared the information with the former leader of the Erudite, which in his turn informed Jeanine. The motivation for hunting divergents is to prevent the situation described by Edith Prior (a increased population of divergents) do not modify the structure of the city's society. The motivation of the attack directed at Abnegation is to prevent the information from becoming public (just as the previous attacks, via newspapers, was to make the members of Abnegation unreliable). The box in the Insurgent trailer could even be a really cool idea, but dramatically modified Jeanine's motivations as it means: 1. No one knew the information, not even the leaders of Abnegation (perhaps only Tris¬¥s mom). 2. Jeanine had no reason to hunt the divergents, except now she is looking for the ""ideal divergent"" (which should be someone who is a GP) to open the box. Completely different from the book, where she is looking for a way to control them via simulation. 3. Kill divergents seem an unusual way if you're behind one of them to reveal a secret information, which means that Jeanine did not know before the attack she would need a divergent to get to it (or she is not so ""erudite"" after all). 4. Jeanine really needed to spend years accusing Abnegation and make a military attack only to find a confidential information? This seems practicable? SO Jeanine is a completely different character in the film.  I hope that is at least fun to watch.",0,0,Snorks The Bassman,suZcGoRLXkU,0.14987789987789985,2014-12-16 19:27:42,True,True

Yes the same characters, similar universe. But this is not okay. In any way. People opinion that it got changed up because the last book is pretty much boring in most opinions. I don't give a damn how shitty the book was, if you're going to make a movie adaption to a series that has thousands of fans already make sure you don't add in any nonsense.

I'm not saying I could make the perfect movie adaption but it sure as hell wouldn't add a box that the readers have no fucking clue about. This makes me so angry and why are people so excited about it? It's nothing like the book, they didn't even have Uriah, Marlene, Lynn in the first movie because he's more fitting to be introduced in the second-?

The whole appeal of the Divergent series is that it's very unique and gives a sort of vibe that seems realistic with the circumstances of characters. A vibe that i've never felt reading or watching any other book or film because it wouldn't be relative or make sense with the plot. Watching this trailer completely eliminated that vibe. Maybe this trailer did a terrible job of depicting the whole movie, but from the trailer, i can say that the vibe it gives me is very neutral, or below neutral, because it seems like just any other action film, but Divergent was a brilliant idea that was communicated well through the books, and had the film been as close to the book as possible, that brilliant idea could be communicated well through the film to those who have and have not read the books. Tis a shame, i've been waiting for almost 2 years. Allegiant better not disappoint because that's the one i'm really looking forward to. My tip: capture the essence of the book which create the perfect vibe of the book, and somehow, with Veronica Roth's help, put that into the film.¬†",0,0,Jasmine Rajab,suZcGoRLXkU,0.20895833333333336,2014-12-21 07:21:06,True,True

They just are not alike whatsoever, of course there is more to the movie but I would have at least HOPED that I would get to see some parts from oh I dunno... THE BOOK!! The trailer could have at least featured event from the book! Most of this was pretty inaccurate. Let me explain of couple of things just so people that actually haven't read the books (shame...) will know what I'm talking about:  #1.¬†First off what the HECK is that box?!?!?! Yes, yes they did explain in the trailer (not the book) that this box was to test out Divergents or something to see if they can open it. Yes it is known that nobody (including Jeanine) knows what the heck is inside of the box. But this had nothing to do with the book and left me¬†a little confused and with lots of questions (suspense is good =, but not suspenseful questions). If they were going to focus a movie on a thing that never even happen in the book it was based off of at LEAST explain a little better what the heck that thing is! ¬† #2.¬†Why was Tris shooting her gun? Let alone even touching the ""monstrous device"". If anybody actually recalls from the book (or movie if you don't read, smh..) Tris shot Will¬† when everybody except The Divergent were under the attack simulation in Abnegation. In the book it goes into a lot of detail what she was feeling in that moment and how she just killed one of her best friends. In the book she couldn't pick up a gun because it reminded her too much of what she did to Will. She was traumatized. And now all of the sudden she has no freaking problem killing 30 people in 10 seconds. No thought of Will, no regrets, no flashbacks.....  #3.¬†Anybody else notice that the factionless looked ON POINT (on fleek if you will). They are supposed to look like a rugged not fed homeless living in a box tattered clothed person. Now all of the sudden they have extremely great weapons and leather jackets to match?? You've GOT to be kidding me!  #4. Did that thing with her mom happen in the book cause I don't remember it at all! I'm pretty sure that's just a fear landscape or maybe just a really scary thought of how her mom has passed and now dead.

Most of us, if we looked it up on YouTube, obviously are interested in it. You are allowed to state what you think about it, just don't go and attack other people for expressing their own thoughts! My opinion is that the trailer is a little misleading and doesn't appear to follow the plot of the book, but trailers never give you the whole movie, for all we know, the movie could be spectacular! Yes, it's going to be a tad bit different, but we should all expect it. I mean, it's an adaptation, not a copy. The people who wrote the movie are only doing their job. They are trying to keep a large audience of people who watched the first movie and another large audience of people who read the books entertained. We should all just be happy that they even decided to make a movie adaptation of the book in the first place. I mean, movies cost thousands of dollars to make. The actors and actresses didn't have to show up everyday for months and take shot after shot of the same scene for days strait. The directors and script writers didn't have to pay the money to even produce the movie. Just be glad the people involved in the movie's production even considered creating it.

It was very disappointing and didn't do justice to the book and as a film in general. I like actors such as Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort and Miles Teller and they were good as Tris, Caleb, and Peter, but I didn't like Theo James as Four/Tobias. In the books, I found Four really fascinating as a character, but James' acting was very wooden and boring which distracted me. I love Kate Winslet, but she doesn't fit as Jeanine IMO. I pictured someone like Meryl Streep as the antagonist just like how she appeared in The Giver. The fact that Al's suicide was just glanced over quickly irritated me. It did affect Tris heavily because of how the faction system can affect a person like him who just felt very overwhelmed by what it did to him.  I have read all three of the books and liked them, with Insurgent being my favorite out of the three. I am going to re-read the series again in the future. This trailer doesn't impress me like the first one did. Also, I hated that Edward was not in the first movie since he plays an important part in the second book (at least in the beginning) when Tris and Four meet him again in the train to Amity since he became factionless. That was after he got stabbed in the eye and had to be sent back. It showed how much brutality was brought onto a former Dauntless and what the faction system can do to someone. How does that happen?

Now, I am pissed off about this box because (SPOILER ALERT) it makes no sense. In the books, it was a computer (I think) and it contained a file that revealed the truth about the city and what was going on outside it.¬† Also, Jeanine studied Tris's brain, not hooked her up to some cables and put her in another simulation. T  The first movie was horrible and ruined a half-decent book. As a movie (not an adaptation) this looks like an attempt at a step up. About the love triangle, I personally think having any love in this book and movie ruins it. Tris is a half-decent protagonist that was ruined by being attached to a love interest.

2015-01-10T12:51:11,"Yes, there are some changes, but from what I saw in the trailer I think the director is staying true to the book believe it or not because as I was reading the book I imagined the whole movie in my head chapter by chapter, and what I see is pretty much what I saw in my head. If every detail in the book was put in the movie it would be predictable to almost everyone who has read the series, so in my opinion it's nice to see some changes cause then you're like wow that's was pretty awesome to have see it done like that. I'm excited to finally see more of the characters from Insurgent like Evelyn, Uriah, Johanna, Marlene, Lynn, Jack Kang, Hector, and Edgar. Every director is different with vision, and he's done movies like The Time Travelers Wife from RED so which is where I think the action pack in this movie came from hahaha. Just remember Divegent fandom, we made this series into what it is now, and it's very hard for a series of books to be amazing after the first movie because of how it's presented in film. Harry Potter, Twilight, The Hunger Games, Divergent and The Maze Runner have been truly the most successful franchises within young adults. But for some series that didn't do well that I had high hopes for like, Beautiful Creatures, The Mortal Instruments, and Vampire Academy, I wish they would continue these ones but with different directors but that's not up to me is it.

2015-01-11T06:55:16,"First, I have to comment on everyone mentioning that most movies adapted from books almost always have plot changes, because they are correct. That happened with the Bourne movies (of which the last one wasn't even written by the original author, but that's the subject of another thread). The entire raison d'√™tre of the Jason Bourne books...yes, the entire backbone of the story was removed to simplify the movie for the screen. It's a very involved book and it would have been impossible to include it all so they went for a basic story line to support an action movie. I'm not a fan of the movies mostly because Matt Damon, as great of an actor as he is, is not Jason Bourne. The fact that a book I loved was deprived of its backbone doesn't bother me as much as the casting because I look at the book and movie as apples and oranges. They are similar but different. Anyway, my husband did not read the books and LOVES the movies. This is just how it goes. I accept it and try to deal with it lol. On a side note, Renner would have made a perfect Bourne based on the book (rugged, tough, but still nice looking and someone who you might see and in the next thought completely forget. This guy was a badass killer spy after all).   As far as Insurgent goes...I just finished reading the book (I found the series from the first movie) and I am looking forward to seeing the movie. I love the cast and I can see the connections from the book to the trailer. As many have said the box is probably an adaptation of the video, the box/house flying through the air is in a simulation and obviously there to bring more excitement to a book that is a bit slower paced/thoughtful. And Tris' hair is cut really short anyway so I don't get the fuss. Do I love a pixie cut on her? Not my favorite, but I don't care about that as much as I care about quality acting. I'm going to enjoy this for what it is, a fresh (and by fresh, I mean new) take on a book I really enjoyed reading. I get the people that are pissed off...I mentioned the Bourne issue because I was ticked off about it for a while because I was invested in that book series...but, it'll gets easier with time everyone ;)",0,0,Got2Bespoke,suZcGoRLXkU,0.23235710766198572,2015-01-11 06:55:16,True,True

Or maybe they have a limited amount of time to use for the entire movie. You never know. So i just hope that the second is as good as the first.

She didn't want them to ""find"" out about the outside world and with Divergent they were going to ruin the system.  2. They were in the main hall at Amity. They were afraid to get captured so they acted like Amity. I'm not sure (i could be wrong). They got caught because of 4 and they saw his tattoos. ¬†(this was a scene i wanted added but im not sure i need to wait to see)  3. Fernando (i think that was his name) was the only time we heard ""insurgent"" out of the book. ¬†  4. The scene with her mom was not included. In my mind, I think that was when she went to Erudite and Caleb told Jeanine to include their mom. They were in a bus and it was peaceful but around them society was collapsing.  5. They took Allegiant and put into a scene in Insurgent? I don't know how they are going to add the last part in Allegiant but it's there choice.¬†  This is just the trailer.

It's not a drama, not a romantic movie, nor a comedy. There's no such genre as ""Young-Adult Dystopia"", so ""Action"" or even ""Science Fiction"" are totally appropriate. Get your ""facts"" straight. Secondly, the producers obviously have read the books since they were the ones who decided: Hey, this book (Divergent) has potential to become a movie. So, clearly they read it, liked it and decided to adapt it. This word is important: ADAPT. They have to modify things to match and rise the general public expectations, the fandom represents 5% or less of the audience. Movies and books work differently, and in Insurgent they have five hundreds of pages to show in nearly a two-hour-long movie. What is important will be portrayed and what is irrelevant (such as the appearance of a hard drive or the colors of Amity's clothes) will be cut. They have already proved that Insurgent will seem way more mature than Divergent, as Insurgent book is also more mature than Divergent. I know that almost everyone who is complaining the fuck out of the changes will see the movie and be like: OMG, that's so awesome. Or I LOVED IT. Just like what happened to Divergent movie changes.

Plus she has a cowardly brother, Caleb who simply isn't built for war and would defect when given the chance. Her self loathing and anger jeanine was compelling to watch until she found her inner peace in the simulation unit.

2015-03-25T00:34:52,"Just watched Insurgent a few hours ago. Here's what I found most importantly different. WARNING: Spoilers. Duh.   The entire meaning of Insurgent was taken out of the movie. Insurgent: adjective. ""rising in active revolt"". This was taken from the part of the book when Tris, Christina, and Marcus teamed up together, correct? Yes. HOWEVER, in the movie, they did NOT team up. (I did not realize this until after the movie was over.) Also, Cara (Will's sister) was no where to be found. Max was not killed by Lynn and Lynn was not shot and confessed she liked Marlene before she died. So, Max and Lynn both didn't die in the movie.  Let's back up a few paces here. Remember in the book how Eric was put on trial in Candor by the Dauntless Loyals? That didn't happen in the movie. After Eric almost shot the little girl but Tris jumped on him, he took her and put handcuffs on her. Action happened, lalalala, etc., then guns are all pointed on Eric and the other Dauntless Traitors. After Eric says ""I learned how to live with the blood on my hands. But can you?"" Four shoots him without warning. In the book, Four whispers, ""Be brave, Eric."" before killing him. I really missed this aspect because it shows how hesitant Four was to shooting Eric. I thought I was going to be more upset about this part in the movie because Jai Courtney is hot as hell, but because it was filmed differently, I don't know how to feel.  This might be very important for all of you guys, too: That ""piercing"" on Tris's shoulder blade is not actually a piercing. It is a little bullet from the Dauntless Traitors attack, when they were searching for Divergents. Remember? This was actually pretty accurate because Tris's shoulder was hurting and hard to maneuver in the book. ¬†  Backing up to the beginning now. I don't mean to disappoint every single person who read Insurgent or anything, but the scene when Tris ate Amity bread which was intoxicated with ""happy serum"" or what I believe is marijuana, and was all happy sappy and Four was pissed for Amity making them happy by feeding them bread and all.... Well, this scene is not in the movie. I'm as sad as you are, fangirls and fanboys.¬†  Now let's go to the ending of the story, when Tori kills Jeanine, right? Tori's pissed at Jeanine for killing her Divergent brother, George Wu. According to the movie, we all read the WRONG BOOK. Tori doesn't kill Jeanine? WHAT?! But... that was her revenge at her for ""killing"" George! That's right, ladies and gents. Instead, in the last moments of the movie, Evelyn goes up behind Jeanine, talking some bullshit, and pulls a gun behind her skull and shoots. FUCK THAT SHIT, RIGHT? I think this is one of scenes I'm mostly angry about.  Ah, what about the sex scene? When I read Insurgent, there were no mentions of sex between Four and Tris and when I read Allegiant there was no obvious sex scenes. But nope, Four and Tris have sex right there and then at Factionless. Sigh. Could this movie get anymore inaccurate?  Another thing that might not be known for those who did not even watch Divergent, but read the entire series is that Caleb's girly friend is no where mentioned. That's right. No Susan anywhere.¬†  One last rant, okay? So recall that back in Amity when the Dauntless Traitors evaded the cafeteria and were shooting everywhere, Tris pushed Peter away from getting killed? Well that wasn't in the movie either, my dearest friends! Instead, while Jeanine, Caleb, and Peter were watching Tris's simulation, Tris had the chance to shoot Peter in her simulation. She didn't do it though, because of her inner Stiff. Also, earlier when Tris had just arrived for her simulation, she was beating up Peter and threatened to Jeanine that if she didn't stop the suicides, then she would kill Peter. Jeanine shrug it off, saying how she has other guards. This made Peter feel like Jeanine didn't care about him and that Tris cared about him more than she did. So then lalala later when Tris is being tested after a rest, Peter gives her the serum that makes her appear dead and lalala Peter is a hero yay. But Miles Teller was the perfect Peter, I don't care what anyone says. He's the well-deserved comic relief dude. But all the actors were casted perfectly! At first, before watching Divergent, I cringed at the thought of Theo James being Four. I mean, he's 29 playing an 18-year old? Ha! But I can't imagine Divergent without him being Four.  Thanks for reading if you've come this far! Hopefully I helped you understand what happened in the movie if you are unable to go see it yourself. Apologies for this being so long but it was necessary. I still loved Insurgent despite that extreme differences. So action-packed! My heart was racing so many times during the film and I jumped and gasped and it was just a great experience nonetheless.",0,0,ashley cory,suZcGoRLXkU,0.08766743970315398,2015-03-25 00:34:52,False,True
