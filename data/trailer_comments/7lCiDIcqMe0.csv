Also, when the two police officers are looking into Eric's psych ward file it is never told which disorder Eric has, but that police officer did look shocked. Bob also asked Eric to stop calling him Bob at the ending. And it would explain why Eric would say he killed Richie Wheelan, but since Bob locks this personality up deep inside of him, he can finally ''kill'' his violent side when he admits that he has one. It could also explain why the Police officer said to Bob at the end ''They can never see you coming'', because the police officer (having read the psych file) knows Bob has a side that nobody, not even himself, knows about.
