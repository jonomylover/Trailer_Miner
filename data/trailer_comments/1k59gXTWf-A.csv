Later members included optimistic minds such as Mark Twain, Amelia Earhart, Ray Bradbury, and even Walt Disney.¬†Using an naturally occurring, invisible power source, they were able to open a portal to another universe. In this alternate universe that runs parallel to our own, members of the Society were free to create a technologically and scientifically advanced world without hindrance or interference. They called this place ""Tomorrowland"", a place visible to only the optimistic at heart. Members of this society are able to move back and forth between Tomorrowland and Earth using special lapel pins. By creating this world, Plus Ultra hoped to one day merge both worlds together when they thought people were ready for it.",1,3,TheMellowPumpkin,1k59gXTWf-A,0.1563025210084034,2014-10-19 15:49:04,True,True

2014-11-10T22:26:07,"The scene unfolds with a minor being released from prison. The US has the highest incarceration rate and still growing. This grim opener seems to impress a growing trend - more arrests and imprisonment. Society, and our planets climate has collapsed and the world is in the brink of self annihilation. Notice the segment (0:23) ""Rampant looting across the east coast.. Severe We.."". A timer is counting down (1:38) to apparently some Apocalyptic event surrounded by disturbing images of pollution, disasters, and human conflict. (0:44) Obama is still in office. This ""secret place""; a lab with a teleportation device into the future. The pin - a relic from the future-past somehow slipped into her belongings during her incarceration. There are 2 ways to get there. Short term application: An apocalyptic event that essentially wipes the slate clean as in a global war or similar event that destroys both life and infrastructure. Survivors begin anew never ascribing IMO to the relics of greed or ignorance like money or religion. ¬†Long term application: An evolution into a more effect, efficient future. The disappearance of the police station, and compact yet futuristic city in the backdrop implies that global conflict did ensue and there are far fewer people in existence.  Also, does the author intend of applying ""Yakir Aharonov"" theory of changing the future to affect the past and essentially change the world as George Clooney implied. Or is it more subtle yet wonderous, as in technology that can alter the weather, the growth of food, and even trajectory of the planets moon to affect sea levels, and more. Perhaps, but mere conjecture without knowing more. I am curious - and I want to see this movie. By the way this level of technology and human achievement _IS_ possible. We can change the world positively to support our existence all the while preserving it's delicate machinations. So long as we ascribe to a monetary system - this and many more imaginative concepts will regrettably be restricted to the artistry of Hollywood.¬†  One thing is for sure. This is definitely going to be a Utopian ""Style"" movie that assumes that the world has succumbed to the artifacts of a failed economical and resource matrix. It will be a candy for the eyes, food for the mind, and maybe.. an Oasis for the hopeful spirit. Disney's imagination does not seem to be bounded to anything. I am curious, and must see this movie.",0,1,Peter Santiago,1k59gXTWf-A,0.033050012318305004,2014-11-10 22:26:07,True,True

2015-05-21T03:42:28,"**SPOILERS, KIND OF** I just came out of the premiere of the movie that was in Montreal.¬†I enjoyed the movie because it reached me personally.  When I was younger, from 5 to 13 years old my parents trained me to become an 'elite' and I was forced to read books on my free time, no video games allowed, no friends allowed at home. Out of a sudden my parents divorced , father met a new girl and we moved to her country ( I am french by the way ) ¬†then due to difficult circumstances I moved back to France to live with my grand parents who were having the same mentality and goals , the same my parents had for me.  Eventually , 2 years later, ¬†I moved back to the other country to live with my father. I was then 15. Having both writers for parents , one versed into philosophy and all different cultures in every form possible and the other one versed into psychology while both were focused on amassing incredible massive knowledge without ever actually sharing their opinions to the world etc. made me think that something was actually wrong with this world. This is where I started to become crazy. I can let you imagine the level of the 'things' I was reading. We had almost 50000 books at home and the library kept growing because my father kept getting books for free due to his different works.  At 15 I was already stubborn to 'change the world' I just had too do it. Actually I think that I was just getting crazier one day after another being totally different mentally than the people that were and are still surrounding me. In brief. The first idea I had at 15 years old was mentioned in the movie but in a way that I couldn't like. The brains of the planet hiding in a secret society to eventually go and share later made me think of Foundation by Isaac Asimov. The second society. In fact I was not at all thinking that this would be the way to go at 15. At this age I thought that getting specialists from different disciplines from all around the world to get into an assembly to resolve every issue from every country was the way to go. That was until I grew up a little bit older and noticed that everybody is actually fucked and that we should push further and that the actual way to start to move things was to attack it to the source, education.  I was waiting /expecting for a huge heritage at this age and I was expecting to use it to start to act follow my dreams ( my grand parents were rich and still alive ) . I was just skipping grades and grades like a breeze. I became so bored that I have drowned under drugs and alcohol to kill my brain , left at 16 my parents house , kept reading by my own, surviving by my own , in a different country and culture than my own, to eventually notice 3 years ago that my grand father died and that the heritage was actually much lower than I thought and that it could never carry my dreams to help the humanity overall. The goal that fossilized in me since I was probably just getting crazy about the huge flow of information and knowledge and life experience I went through.. too soon.  What I would like to say is that the 'dream' of this movie is to tell you that you can go to a secret society where brains exist and that live secretly to avoid the world craziness. That is a very dangerous goal , do not take this movie too seriously. Do not think that you are intelligent because you know a few or even a lot of things.¬†  I could carry on forever but I think I did enough.",0,0,mata hari,1k59gXTWf-A,0.042764618011096885,2015-05-21 03:42:28,False,True
