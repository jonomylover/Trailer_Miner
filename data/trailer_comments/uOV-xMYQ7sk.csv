Even from the trailers for Scooby will 100% honestly prove to everybody in the world that this is going to be not only a irresistibly fun can't-miss animated event in recent memory, but it's also, hands down, a fun new animated-themed Cinematic Universe experience that everybody (as well as the non-Hanna-Barbera crowd out there) will absolutely love for a LONG time. And in case you guys decide to make Scooby into a film franchise for the Hanna-Barbera Cinematic Universe, do this: Daphne Blake not only have feelings for Fred and they both have a relationship with each other later down the line, but Daphne also have feelings for Velma Dinkley and they both have a secret relationship with each other later down the line as well and they both like to party out like it's 1999 at THE most fun and coolest girls-only night club (with THE most sexiest modern day night club clothes the world has ever seen) in all of Coolsville, period! #DontLetTheFansDownWB #Scooby #HannaBarberaCinematicUniverse",0,0,Mary Ellen Pallozzi,uOV-xMYQ7sk,0.11538505354294828,2019-02-11 18:51:13,True,True

2019-02-14T05:15:34,"One popular interpretation of the song is of the singer feeling trapped by this woman (La Llorona) who has fallen in love with him. If he even thinks about leaving her, she weeps. He tries everything in his power to leave her, but he is trapped by pity for the woman. He wishes to be taken down to the river to be drowned, and so then his suffering can finally end. The suffering that the man goes through from being trapped in a relationship with a woman in a way parallels the suffering that the woman in the legend goes through from having her lover leave her. Other interpretation following the lyrics is that the ""llorona"" is the singers, a possible dessertor in the version here, deceased or married to another lover which would explain all the morbid references through the song and why he never seems to actually try to get to her ""duelo"" mourning, ""campo santo"" cementery, ""ayer lloraba por verte llorona y ahora porque te v√≠"" yesterday I cried for seeing you Llorona and now because I saw you. The Llorona is traditionally a Banshee like folk ghost that haunts her lover after having drowned her children and is now crying for her children and fortells dead to those who see it but is not really related to this song.

2019-03-30T06:52:29,"I remember my parents telling me about la llorona.   I always listened for her cries when we were out, she genuinely terrified me.   Like, I knew about el coco and witches and shit, but my uncle pointed out UFOs and called them witches and I had no idea why I was supposed to be scared. Probably because Harry Potter was the first thing that came to mind when I thought about witchcraft.   I would walk to the darkest rooms in my house and look deep into closets with no end and even keep my eyes open when I was supposed to be asleep and I had no idea why the cucuy was supposed to be scary, so I didn't give a shit. But la llorona?   Holy shit, I tried not to think of her because I was told she only cried for those who listened, and sometimes I was a little brave (only in the car) and looked out the window to see if I'd see her passing figure or hear her sobs echo.   Just, holy shit. Imagine bloody mary with the longest fingernails ever crying like the witch from Left4Dead, but instead of simple sobs she was chanting ""mis hijos"" (my children). I imagined that as her, and if she felt even the tiniest bit of my glance (like a fucking enderman in minecraft) she'd start chasing me and threatening to drown me too. I was scared to death.  You know how I mentioned the dark and el coco? There were two big windows in my childhood bedroom. One behind my bed with the curtains always shut and another to the right with a great view of the outside world if one was low enough to the ground or lying down (I was both, since I was a child). If you were tall enough, you could look _into_  my room through the blinds, but no one was tall enough since the window was pretty high and the bottom half was covered by an AC.   Anyway, instead thinking about witches peering inside to try to recruit me or sacrifice me or el coco hiding under my bed (or in my closet, which scared me more than the bottom of my bed), I always focused my hearing on the outside because I was trying to catch her wails. I feared her cries would come closer and closer until I saw her tall dark figure through the window and then her eyes peering down at me, still crying and her sobbing for her children. Just.  La Llorona scares me, man. El coco and witches were scary, and I mostly received threats about el coco coming for me if I didn't do basic stuff like sleep or do my chores. Witches were looming figures I occasionally heard about. Bad role models, evil wenches that I should avoid, nothing actually scary since I only ""saw"" them once, but I guess they felt more real than the cucuy.   But la Llorona was the reason I never left my parents side when we weren't at home, especially considering how many times we went to places surrounded by dark woods or empty streets. She wasn't the slenderman or the slit-mouthed woman, she was both. She could follow me everywhere and wait outside my home for me.   I have never considered that she could have very well entered my house. Wtf.",43,2,bourgeoisHellion,uOV-xMYQ7sk,-0.039048367774782856,2019-03-30 06:52:29,True,True

2019-04-04T01:11:18,"To y'all wondering, ""la llorona"" is based on a true story, This Mexican woman loved a Spanish man and they had 3 kids. They kept their relationship on the low. He then left her for a wealthy woman, and she was pissed, out of anger and revenge seeking, She then drowned her kids. She realized what she had done and turned herself crazy looking for the bodies of her drowned kids.    Then the myths kick in when people start saying they seen her, and or heard her before, which I call bullshit. Until it happens to me, I won't believe the myths.   Many people have altered the story to scare their kids straight. For example, one version says she kidnaps kid's that are alone. (parents altered this story so their kids don't wander off.)

Like why does the villain have to look similar to the ring or grudge character. Sorry been there done that. This culture needs a fresh look. I'm suprise this isnt straight to DVD or Netflix special. I wouldn't be suprise if it got low ratings for cheap jump scares and poor dialogue. Theres plenty to tell about this story but in a horror aspect it looks all too familiar.

2019-04-07T16:42:26,"I feel like they got the story wrong. So basically a young beautiful lady(poor) lived in Mexico. She was the most beautiful girl there. A rich young man fell in love with her, and they eventually had kids. (Take note that the rich father did not like her, so they had to run away with each other) they had two kids, both boys. The father always went out, leaving the young mother and the kids alone. The father used to always bring presents to everybody. But soon, the father became distant to the mother, only bringing presents to the kids. He then started to come back rarely. And then finally, he just never came back. A few years later(after she became old, and less beautiful) she was strolling along a river with her two kids. When all of a sudden, a familiar young man came in a carriage, and he had a beautiful young woman who looked very wealthy(somebody that the young man‚Äôs father would be proud of) he greeted the kids and glanced at the mother. And gave a smug look at her. Then they went away. Enraged, embarrassed, and humiliated, she pulled her kids to the river and threw them into the water. After realizing what she has done, she threw her self into too, hoping to reunite with he two lost kids in the afterlife. See, she couldn‚Äôt. Because she has done the two worst sins(murder and suicide) Now, she is forced to walk along the river, crying hoping to find her children. If you hear her crying, use that as a warning because if she sees and/or touches you, you will have bad luck for the rest of your life. For children it‚Äôs fatal, because she will come to a kid. Thinking it‚Äôs her lost children. When she realizes it‚Äôs not hers, she will throw the kid into the water. So basically, she‚Äôs not looking for your children. She‚Äôs looking for her children.

2019-04-14T13:54:12,You can tell this movie going to be lame. Just like every supposed scary movie lately.. La llorona shouldn't be a jump scare movie. It should be a psychological thriller. And plus how many things this movie got wrong from what the legends have been told..  I didn't hear her once in the trailer say Ay mis hijos. O why is a woman and children being chased. For what I've hear it mainly appears to men. And if you hear her cry far away means she's close and vice versa. Plus I've never once heard the llorona going inside people houses. Scary movies are so lame now. And it looks like it's getting worse. Plus why not make this in a Spanish speaking country not in the US.  Latin America being so huge why make it in the US. So many wrong things with this trailer. And movie concept.. I wouldn't not even watch it free online unless I feel like watching a funny movie. Jump scares are funny. Scary movies and horror movies should be based on psychological aspect. Some that will mess with your head and have you looking left and right on the way to your car from the theater..

There is no credible source or evidence to the events that inspired the tale/legend of La Llorona.      Maria, angry and hurt, took her children to a river and drowned them in a blind rage. She realized what she had done and searched for them, but the river had already carried them away. Days later, she was found dead on the river bank. Challenged at the gates of heaven for the whereabouts of her children, she was not permitted to enter the afterlife until she finds them. Stuck between the land of the living and the dead, she spends eternity looking for her lost children. She is always heard weeping for her children, earning her the name ""La Llorona.""[1] It is said that if you hear her crying, you are to run the opposite way. If you hear her cries, they could bring misfortune or even death.

2019-04-20T14:03:10,"""The Curse Of La Llorona"" released in Australia as ""The Curse Of The Weeping Woman"" is a thriller horror film based on the Mexican folklore of La Llorona. She is the ghost of a woman who drowned her children and now cries while looking for them in the river, often causing misfortune to those who are near or hear her. There is no credible source or evidence to the events that inspired the tale of La Llorona. This film is the sixth of The Conjuring Universe directed by Michael Chavez which is much much better then the previous release, ""The Nun"". There are moments of significant fright and suspense which ensures its entertainment value. However rushed conclusion felt as bad as rushing through a large plate of nachos with extra jalapenos.

2019-04-20T15:46:15,"Truly, this is stupid.  I heard of the story of La llorona when I was a kid.  I first heard it in New Mexico where my dad's from.  Anyhow, the truth is, those who go to Hell will cry forever in utter darkness and hot, hot, heat.  Listen to  what Christ says in the gospel accounts...  Matthew 10:28 - ""And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.""    (Christ is speaking about God in this verse.)  Matthew 18:9 - And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.  (Christ is speaking about falling into the temptation to sexually lust after someone, with the eyes.  [Ex: viewing porn, or lusting after women/men].  Mark 9:43 - ""And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire.""  (He's speaking about lusting with the hand: master*#%ing; or stealing/ being a thief).   The above two sins pertain to never having repented of them after a long life of doing it;  Or never repenting of your sins at all, until you die without forgiveness of your sins.  Then you'll have to bear the weight of your sins & God's wrath, that Christ took for all His people--who've repented and believed that He died and rose from the dead on the 3rd day (for them)...according to the Scriptures.  Remember there were two thieves on the cross beside Christ?  What happened to one and what happened to the other???   One repented and the other didn't.  One was forgiven [even while on his deathbed] and the other...well, we know that he went to Hell.  There's two kinds people in this world.  Those that have the privilege of knowing God, and those that don't.  My encouragement to you who are reading this, is to pick up a Holy Bible and begin reading it.  Begin with the New Testament--focusing on the first 4 books [Matthew, Mark, Luke & John].  Those 4 are on the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  That's where I started and now I know him- personally, like the thief on the cross who was pardoned/redeemed and justified.  There's still time for you.  There's still hope while you're alive.   Bonus:  ‚ÄúI tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do.  But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!""  Luke 12: 4-5    [Jesus speaking about his Father as Judge of all].  ""And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, ‚ÄúThe kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son,  and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. Again he sent other servants, saying, ‚ÄòTell those who are invited, ‚ÄúSee, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.""  But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.  The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.  Then he said to his servants, ‚ÄòThe wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.'  And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.  ‚ÄúBut when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment.  And he said to him, ‚ÄòFriend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?‚Äô And he was speechless. Then the king said to the attendants, ‚ÄòBind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.‚Äô  For many are called, but few are chosen.‚Äù Matthew 22:1-14 (Parable of the Wedding Feast) ¬†  ..Here Christ is speaking about those who were invited to church to worship God, but never came.  Those folks disregarded their Creator and Jesus Christ, God's son.  Those that never heard the truth as the truth is in Jesus, never get to the see the dawn of day.  They die in their sins and though he/she may have supposed himself/herself to be a ""GOOD PERSON"", the truth is, no one is good.  Just God.  He's good.  Everything about Him is good.  And nothing bad/evil or sinful will come into the presence of God.  We're to live holy lives...and this movie is a disgrace, which is why I write this.  Yes, there will be many lloronas in Hell.  I hope you're not one of them...cause you're not going to like it there, if you go.  Eternal torment is what the Bible says.  ...And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners [North, East, South, West] of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.  And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them, and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet [Muhammad or Buddha-- any false religion] were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.  [Revelation 20:7-10]   *My point:   Stay away from these (horror) movies.  They do you NO good.  See this here--->   ‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.‚Äù This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.   So Jesus again said to them, ‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.‚Äù   (John 10:1-18)   *Follow Jesus and learn from Him....you'll learn the Truth",0,0,C B,uOV-xMYQ7sk,0.14819959802102659,2019-04-20 15:46:15,False,True

Trump says he wanna build a wall but Llorna wanna stay in the the US part of the US (Not South America baiscally - Sos I m shit at geography!) Anyways in order for Llorna to stay she has to do a case and have a valid reason to stay. So... she decides to steal some american born kids from a white woman so she has a visa/passport to stay. Thats why she starts hunting down the kids and tries to kill the mudda so she has a valid reason to stay on the 'other side' of Trumps wall.
