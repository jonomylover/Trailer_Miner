Then, during the second one you hear about how he's getting his old job back, his former boss is in town, and includes the introduction of a female character who will possibly who overly cheerful, and peppy which contrasts his laid back, cool guy persona. Then comes the great ruining when his ex-girlfriend appears, and then you hear her getting pissy about him working too much in order too avoid what she believes is ""real work"" i.e., their former relationship.
