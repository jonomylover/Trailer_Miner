It was comical itself. im an avid reader and i never finish books once ive gotten a few chapters in bad or good. for the life of me i could not finish this damn book. it was horrible. i got to the part where she was visiting her mom and her and her stalker had sex in his bathroom. she said something stupid again for the 100th time. holy cow or gee whiz whatever it was and i just ugh i couldnt do it. worst book ever. movie wasnt that bad compared to the book. still tacky though. i feel for anyone who feels inadequate in bed after reading that cause he literally did nothing half the people in the world dont do everyday. Like he literally use nothing in his red roon of pain that you dont have in your room. So you can stop with the articles now. We get it.

Like, I know it's a black person movie like Straight Outta Compton but funnier, but even tho Straight Outta Compton was a black person movie, I still thought it was good... Like, I didn't get all of the slang and stuff, but it was still pretty badass and so was the soundtrack for it. I feel like if someone like me, who is as white as the light is bright (lol, like my fave film is Napoleon Dynamite, which is totally a white kid film - even tho i'm sure some black ppl liked it too) just goes to show that maybe we as a society are moving towards more ""cultural appropriation"" in films (i hope I used that term correctly, without offence). Like, even the fact that I think that this is a brilliant spin on the film. The white version of Fifty Shades wasn't even that good honestly.... I think this black version will be much better. So I'm gonna see it. What do you guys think about the white vs. black versions, which are you more excited to see and what do you think about us, as white folks, moving towards cultural acceptance and embracing the ""other"" and going out to see things like this or Straight Outta Compton and enjoying other cultures and their work, rather than just sticking to the norm for us? I don't mean for this to be offensive, I just wanna write my next essay for school on this idea of embracing and finding the ""other"" as we progress in society even tho there is still so much racism in this sinister world?
