It's other movie genres, that can be shown with Black people. We are much better than always being at each other's throats. It's time for a change. Instead of always showing us as violent, hurting, poor, using drugs, uneducated, dysfunctional, and etc., we can see a lot of empowering roles, more loving and embracing movies, love comedies, happy families, powerful historical movies, science type of movies, futuristic movies, positive and etc. We are not a one trick pony type of people. Our people are so comfortable and conditioned, to see these types of movies and don't understand how these negative imageries affect us. I believe if we have more positive images of us in film, business, T.V., and other things we will be able to fix our communities and all other things. Not saying images are the only thing that can change our plight, but in today's society a lot of people have become influenced more, by what they see on social media, movies, T.V. shows, and images. So it's a big deal to see more positive images and roles of our people. Look at the movie Black Panther, people/children were more excited about seeing that movie than anything else this year. A lot of people expressed how they felt about seeing that movie. So it makes a huge difference to push a better image of us as a whole.",0,2,MegaBeautifulTruth,wlpunOUxYSo,0.12372769506915848,2018-02-17 03:43:07,True,True

2018-02-20T01:23:21,"Memo to ALL Liberal-minded feminist Black  women:   This movie is an intense character study of the liberal-minded black woman on film. It shows how a marriage built on lust and not Almighty GOD at the core can turn a fairytale marriage into fatal attraction lightning quick. It's NO surprise that Taraji P. Henson's been specifically cast in this film Acrimony and tv show Empire, to demonstrate the mindset of a mentally and emotionally unstable liberal woman who feels that she's equal to a man. And how she will go to extreme lengths to prove that she's more cutthroat. This film clip trailer is ABSOLUTE confirmation that if we call out every MAN to be accountable for their actions, ALL WOMEN NEED to be held accountable as well.   This film is confirmation that just like Taraji P. Henson's character, all of liberal-minded black women have ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY for your words and actions. And especially when they come from deep-rooted ANGER, the social environment and parental upbringing that you grew up with. I hope this sheds light on the journey that turned Taraji P. Henson's character from peaceful to absolutely ruthless. As a hardworking brotha, I'm not perfect. No one in this world üåé is and that's a fact. But I'm grateful 2 Almighty GOD for life and for helping me be accountable for my words and actions. In my opinion, Taraji P. Henson's character in Acrimony should be a cautionary tale to MEN everywhere that's looking for a long-term partner. WOMEN, this also a cautionary tale for YOU because there's a great deal of masculine energy covering up the feminine energy portrayed by Taraji P. Henson in this film clip. When children are involved, that's where confusion starts to settle in. We need to understand our culture and where we're from in terms of manners, tact, WISDOM and RESPECT in the home and our community as  whole. WOMEN aren't supposed to be operating under masculine energy at all. Women are supposed to be submissive to their husbands and husbands are to be submissive to their wives in the covenant of marriage.   This film touches on 6 subjects: Marriage, Anger, Infidelity, Jealousy, Unforgiveness and Revenge.",0,0,Ed Coke,wlpunOUxYSo,-0.02210144927536231,2018-02-20 01:23:21,True,True

We did Youtube videos for the books but she took them all down. I just wish she at least was given a chance. As far as TP goes, maybe some of you are tired of movies with the strong black woman theme at its core. But Tyler's movies brings abuse to the forefront.

THIS IS DONE SO THEY MAKE 1 COMPLETE EXPERIENCE!! Sometimes that's 2 people, 3 people, 4 people, or they seem promiscuous. When in fact they aren't. The fact could be as simple as the company they are keeping just being too stupid, selfish, blind, in denial, or unable to merely see them for who they really are in essence so they can't fully give them what they need. PERIOD! News Flash... Doesn't always make the Cheater a Hoe, Slut, or Bad Person because they cheated. Sometimes, there is a selfish, stupid, choose not to apply, see, or do lazy partner that ignores their need and human natures inner desire takes over. QUESTION..... If you live with a person that is suppose to provide for you, and they keep a roof over your head, but don't provide electricity, and food, are you going to sit inside in the dark and starve to death?

It reminds me of some of his roots in thrillers back in the day, specifically ""The Family that Preys"", which incidentally also is a sexual cheating thriller, and also co-stars Ms. Henson. I did prefer The Family that Preys. The action picks up towards the ending, but there is a good buildup of suspense and laughter throughout the film which Tyler is graciously known for doing. He blends thriller, drama, and comedy quite well. The comment about Mel's new boo penis size too small for his tall height is hilarious!

Taylor  So tired of Tyler Perry exploiting black women...now white people are going to think we are all mad because all of the black men don't treat us right....thanks a lot Tyler Perry for hermenigizing black women... So over it....  For me... Telling the truth is NEVER exploiting: to advance or further through exploitation; to promote;to utilize, especially for profit...You are being exploited everyday you walk out your door--by some places of employment--women makes far less than men, higher education institutions--they really don't care if you graduate or not!--grocery stores and markets--commercials--McDonald's don't care that we are dying everyday in America from obesity--The internet, the security system you may use to get in and out of your home--the one Safe-Life securities just exploited you into buying--giving you a false sense of safety and security. IT ALL ABOUT----MONEY--That's all EVERYONE THINKS ABOUT--not just Tyler Perry!  Walmart--don't care if you have a light bill due--all they want you to do is come in there and spend, spend,-spend--for what--PROFIT!!!!!! And you know how WE are---we rather give it to Sam Walton's family instead of one of own people!!!!!!!! So many black woman ARE mad as hell--with reason--Again, the TRUTH is NEVER EXPLORATION!  I forgot to mention the 62.46 billion U.S. dollars in 2016--that's not even the current statistics--the beauty industry made exploiting women--giving them a false sense of beauty---because I have seen some of these women on YouTube taking off their make-up--OMG-Wow!!

We sleep in the same bed as sometimes we start something which ends just seconds into it. I just grew to dislike her. I waited for distance to separate us. I wasn't cheating but boy I wanted out of the relationship. Sometimes I want to cry about life. How I ended up with someone so careless about anything, herself, and her hygiene. She wasn't cheating and was as honest as anyone can be. But living together for a year exposed me to other side of her I didn't intend to make permanent.  Life can be strange sometimes. You like someone today and tomorrow you wonder how it happened. Now I am free and that made me really careful about girls I talk to. I find it hard to date now. Being single can be difficult but I discovered if I channel that passion to find love into something else it will turn out great.

The movie was entertaining as far as his movies go, but so unrealistic.   Alert: Long Spoilers below:  1. Where is Mel's father? And why does Robert's father have to be locked up? Every TP movie lacks a strong father figure. Even in Daddy's Little Girls, the leading male character didn't know who his father was. ü§î  2. Was Mel the only daughter to get money? Why was the house left to her? The other sister was engaged so wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to leave it to the daughter who is starting a family soon? ü§î  3. Why are they walking in front of a green screen for the park scene? Why is there a bench in the middle of the sidewalk?  ü§î  4. How did Robert grow 10 inches taller in 20 years? Was he a late bloomer? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   5. How did Robert go to college on a SCHOLARSHIP if he was a convicted   felon?? Fannie Mae do background checks too . ü§î  6. During the 20 years, why didn't Robert get the felony expunged so he could've gotten a better job?? He had an engineering degree. ü§î  7. Why does the dark skin sister have to have a dark skin husband and the light skin sister have to have a light skin husband? TP loves his colorism...üòî  9. Why is Mel and her BFF still working as office assistants after 20 years? No promotions huh? ü§î  10. When did Mel start smoking?? ü§î  11. Why didn't Mel sue for rights to the name since she added the ""Force"" part?? A judge may have granted her that ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  12. Why does TP always show the man's booty but have the women covered u---nevermind...  13. How does Mel even get on the ship?? She was at home during the wedding right? ü§î  14. Why was the pregnacy just glossed over?? That should have been the main reason that drove her crazy and led her to snap since she wasnt able to have his children. ü§î  15. Why does TP think he is still writing For Colored Girls?? That bathroom scene with Diana sitting on the floor was supposed to be poetic but it was just awkward. Diana hasn't seen this man in 20 years yet she knows he's a good man? She's beautiful and ambitious so why is she still single? ü§î  16. Why did the final boat scene read like a cheesy YouTube movie with that amateur suspenseful music when the crew jumped over board ?? üò©  17. Why would Mel just step directly in the chain when most people naturally would have moved it out of the way??  Seems like TP rushed that entire scene. Ok ok so even if TP loved the idea of having her step into her own chain of death, he could've at least had Robert try and save her as she's going down, he's holding on to her on the side of the boat like some Titanic stuff. The new wife comes back alone to help Robert and she hears him telling Mel he loves her, hold on, I got you, I've never stopped loving you, blah blah blah. He tries to pull on the chain but he goes overboard too and due to his injury is not able to swim effectively and he drowns. The new wife looks on in disbelief and is now left to wonder if he only married her to get back at Mel. Just like when they were younger and he chose Mel over her. Just my two cents...

2018-07-21T09:31:16,"Spoiler. My opinion on this movie. I feel both sides are in the wrong. Melinda  accepted to be his girlfriend since colleges days then accepted to take him back even after he cheated with the other girl. With that came the shatter of of her ovaries meaning no babies for the future due to her rage of running her car into his RV home he was caught in the act in.  Then comes the spending of the 350,000 all mostly on him because she wanted to help him and see him succeed. Robert was very invested in bringing his battery project to life and sometimes your dreams will take years to fulfill as to why it took him 18 years+ to finally get into business with the company. During all these years his wife is the one taking care of the bills and necessities of the home  which he should have also contributed someway despite his criminal record. I'm sure he could have got a job that pays something but  he was too obsessed with his project, even though he loved her. Now with the reunion of this other girl who happens to leave his wallet in his work truck that is discovered by with co working in-laws it puts him in deeper trouble. Melinda will now trust an affair has been going on all these years with THE SAME GIRL. Even with Robert getting the career at the same place this same girl works and giving Melinda  that 10 million dollars and paying her mothers mortgage after their divorce that SHE granted- it isn't enough for Melinda who has invested in this relationship for life. Now with this alleged pregnancy on Robert new wife who is the same girl he cheated with years ago- it drives a barren Melinda over the edge. Everything really comes down to that Robert only used her for two decades while seeing this other woman and finally became successful WITH THIS OTHER WOMAN NOT MELINDA AS HE PROMISED HER OF THEIR RICHES TOGETHER. This can surely drive someone to madness if they cannot control their impulses.   This movie is a lesson on patience and trust and how the lack of those can surely end people up in biggest regrets or in worst cases death.  10/10 for me.

Second, I would not have gotten so crazy like she did but would definitely have some emotional shit to deal with. Women we get tired and so tired we throw in the towel. Now my point of view on how the situation would of worked out perfectly. Even though, Taraji divorced him, and became mean to him, he could have looked on it from another point of view. Since he made the millions of dollars, give her the same money that he did, but instead of just bringing her flowers, he should of brought that diamond ring that he promised her, got on his knees and proposed over to her and give all the things that he promised her, after all he said that he still loved her.

2019-04-06T10:04:36,"SPOILER alert!  I would have dubbed him after the cheating period but the way I saw it is that I really understood her mental breakdown I really sympathize with her all the sacrifices she did for him, and let‚Äôs not pretend he didn‚Äôt ask for them like most men when they throw it in your face ‚Äú I didn‚Äôt ask you to ‚Äú because this man did, many times and she did it all over because she loved him it was second nature to her as breathing.    All she ever wanted was for him to get a job and help around because she was so tired after a while the whole battery thing must have taken a toll on her, but even then she never doubted his intelligence she was there from the start. When he got upset that Prescott security asked him to stay away she was clearly distressed for him and felt sad for him, she was there from the start  helping him with supplies and even a name for it. She just wanted to have him help around but what made her stick through and not lose hope  was the promises of her boat her ring and everything he promised. Maybe she was delusional that way just like a child want their favorite toy his promises and words was that little glimpse of hope for her.   Now to see the wallet of a bitch you once saw with your own eyes,  your husband fuck with and cheat with ALONE Is enough to make someone lose it specially when you are already going through an emotional breakdown, and then on top of that Diana was helping Robert and that must have hurt too because Melinda is the one who been helping him the MOST! Diana just happened to work in the same building so her helping him wasn‚Äôt even that hard, if Melinda has the same contacts trust she would have helped him even more! And I feel like Diana she got all the credit but in my opinion Melinda did the most.  And yes she divorced him she was under the influence of her sisters being fed up losing the house but come on how many times do people say something and regret it?? That‚Äôs normal. You can‚Äôt think straight while being distressed. But he didn‚Äôt even fight for her!!!he fought more for his battery than he ever fought for his wife. And the only time he showed remorse was on the divorce day but come on that‚Äôs too late she even said herself he never checked up on her ask her how she‚Äôs doing nothing.   So when she understood he made it she was proud trust me she was in her maniac episode it was too much for her reacting normally cause she was losing it already there and had lost it, but she was truly happy for him. People breakup all the time and get back together but they only broke up once  and when she misses him and wants him back (it‚Äôs not for the success) she finds out that with the WOMAN he cheated with the visual way, already engaged giving her all the things he promised her she‚Äôs pregnant like that hurts and I understand the pain but Melinda was wrong for investing in Robert he was chasing his dream all along she lost her own identity in him after the cheating she should have left his sorry ass and if not after the ten million dollars and house that yeah was generous she should have invested her money in something and moved on as painful as it was but she didn‚Äôt she was clearly sick in a way she sentenced herself to her own misery.  By the way from a woman‚Äôs perspective once you given someone your time your youth your all no amount of money nothings can fix that no money no nothing but the love of the man or self love.",4,7,Mona Naimi,wlpunOUxYSo,0.15090430402930405,2019-04-06 10:04:36,False,False

If he really loved her he would've stayed fighting, you don't just throw 18 years away man. He was a good man, but Melinda and Diana were only good enough for him if he could use them to get to the top/be successful. Diana of course left her purse in the truck on purpose because she was lusting after him while watching his videos and she knew how crazy Melinda would get if she knew he was ""cheating"". She also knew that she had the power to make him become successful, so of course that's what she did and now she's living her best life. Melinda deserved better in life, but out of love she chose to settle for less and sacrifice her future for his dreams. I do believe that Robert did love Melinda, but not as much as she loved him. He gave Diana everything that he had promised Melinda and that is truly heartbreaking. Maybe because Melinda chose to divorce him, his ego got bruised and then he used Diana as a replacement for Melinda, but really he just wished it was Melinda by his side instead. Another thing is that Diana looks younger than Melinda and she is more successful as well and that makes her more attractive than Melinda. Of course that is not Melinda's fault, she was tired and overworked and doing the most for Robert.
