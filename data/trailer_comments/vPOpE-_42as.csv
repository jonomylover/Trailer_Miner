Stranded on tiny rock, most of the film involves her shouting for help and vainly trying to swim for shore but fear/pain/danger overtakes her each time and she has to return. Shark appears at some point during this struggle to increase tension. Climax begins with the rising tide, eventually forcing her to make frantic swim for shore - this is where lots of close-ups of bloody leg will be, with blood misting into the sea, cut to shark turning swiftly as if in response. snap back and forth from frantic woman and hunting shark. Tussle ensues close to shore which involves shark teeth and a kicking woman, possibly makeshift weapons are produced to fight off shark. Heroic woman makes it to safety.

The plot is that she gets attacked by a shark when surfing as the opening scene and climbs on a rock, and then is stranded on the rock with a shark surrounding her while she tries to make it to shore that is only 200 yards away. I really hope it turns out good because it seems interesting but on a real note, I can't see this being more than a half hour and it may feel boring and exaggerated if they stretch it into an hour and a half or longer full length film. I can only see this taking place for about a half hour and IMDB confirms that there are only really 2 or 3 actors involved.

2017-06-23T21:12:36,"Fucking ridiculous movie. It started out well, I actually really enjoyed it, and then they just over exaggerated it far too much that it just became unrealistic and not enjoyable. They made so many mistakes such as a moment in the film where she is calculating the sharks movements... taking 32 seconds to circle around and come back. As soon as she starts filming, there is not a shark in sight. Secondly, you can see how clear the water is, keep in mind she is still in fairly shallow water too. However, every time she tried to look for the shark, she can't see it, and then suddenly it comes from nowhere. When they film the shark from bird-eye view, it is clearly visible. There's so many more problems, such as how the scar on her leg doesn't fit the size of the shark jaw even slightly, she somehow has phone reception out in the middle of nowhere at a beach. The list just goes on and on. Not worth the watch in my opinion. If you are picky like me, and wanted this movie to portray a realistic scare thriller for you, this is not the one. I must admit, I was clinching my hands at times, and it was tense, but just not realistic and didn't actually scare me.

2017-11-20T01:24:08,So let me see if I got this right. anyway you have this tiny little toothpick surf chick right. Then in same water that she Surfin in and that's not far away from her there's a big huge dead whale carcass floating in the water. So anyway the shark goes after this skinny tiny little toothpick surf chick instead of going after this big dead stinky smelling whale carcass doesn't make sense at all. Now if I was the shark instead of going after this skinny tiny little toothpick surf chick. I would go after  the dead stinky smelly floating whale carcass that's floating in the water. And not some skinny tiny little toothpick surf chick that wouldn't fill my stomach. Like I said doesn't make sense. Most sharks that I know where to go after the whale carcass. Oh well I guess sharks are picky and what they want to eat. Anyway the shallows rocked & it was also a pretty good movie as well.

2019-03-25T13:11:43,"Perfect Trailer  - short and effective, doesn't say to much Amazing movie  - not too long and it stays thrilling until the end Great main actor  - Lively gives everything and it doesn't get boring at all even if it's about her the whole time ¬ª I usually don't like movies with shark attacks because it's always the same: a big bad shark is attacking and killing everyone, but this one surprised me. It shows how cruel animals can be but for the most part it is about the survival instincts of the main character.¬ª",1,0,evo k,vPOpE-_42as,0.07998405103668264,2019-03-25 13:11:43,False,False
