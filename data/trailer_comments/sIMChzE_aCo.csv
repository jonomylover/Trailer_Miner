2018-03-21T02:01:54,"Ridiculous.  We don't kill kids in situations like that.  We bury them in WP after giving them a dose of the 'good stuff' to blend the details of the memory (if it's done within 48hrs you can almost completely erase short term memories before they imprint as long term).  And in ten years, it won't matter what she says.  Any more than it matters that Bonnie Ray Williams says that Kennedy was standing, waving at the crowd, ON HOUSTON STREET when he was shot.  What made the first film good was that the FBI girl was 'everyman', getting more than a toe dipped in the world of intel/drugs/LE at it's most mixed.  She was you.  Wide eyed and just trying to keep track of everyone on the scorecard.  But the war still went on.  The dumbest part of the whole show was the female agent playing hard to get over a fucking piece of paper that also will have no meaning in ten years.  Look at JE Hoover shutting down the Kennedy murder investigation KNOWING, from the Potito autopsy, that there was a front quarter shooter.  Look at Comey stonewalling and quashing the Hillary investigation.  The FBI hasn't been 'innocent' since the 1920s when they created the fucking beast.  Back then, it was booze.  Today it's drugs.  No agent going into that quagmire is going to be shocked by what was shown in 'Sicario'.  We do the same things here at home and that's _all_ FBI since we severed the Mafia connection.  Just look at Seth Rich.  Shot twice, walked to a street by his killers and sat down on a curb to bleed out, picked up by an ambulance, had his whole medical suite taken over by 'cops' and died from non-life threatening injuries after his doctors were excluded from the room for the whole night.  And we have men like John Podesta saying in an EML: 'OMG, I never thought it would get wet.'  Thinking that this kind of evil is something that is confined to Mexico is simply not practical.  Again, every FBI agent has to know this kind of stuff is happening, weekly, and yet they show up for work, every day, like they are on the good guys' side.  'Soldato' will fail for two reasons:  1.  It isn't realistic. The CIA has _never stopped_ being a drug funded agency.  In fact, it's likely true that the biggest secret behind their 'undisclosed' yearly budget is that they don't really need it, as an independent actor on the world stage.  Fifty years of the Golden Triangle, South American and now the Afghan heroin/cocaine/heroin mess has probably made them, unofficially, a trillion dollar 'Company'.  Since Mexico is the biggest open landroute which can supports the influx of a drug epidemic which we now suffer _why_ would the CIA fight it?  The Cartels are the distributorship.  They aren't the owners.  Far from it.  2.  There are no lone wolves. The emphasis on Mr. Del Toro as the Man Of Mystery (almost as out of place as Mz. FBI had once been, yet clearly familiar to all involved...) made sense as the Mexican Federale go between as it was already a very adhoc mixed bag of SOF, Intel and so on.  Now it's not.  And his position as a lone wolf assassin, working the Mexican side of the border where 'we cannot be' makes little sense in the larger picture of #1.  Unless he is aware that killing drug dealers is about killing competitors who walk outside the plantation lines.  Again, this would be a very appropriate thing to cynically do, given what the drug dealer at the end said about 'Yeah, and who taught us how to be that way?  Why it was you and the Americans!' in the last film.  And would certainly open American eyes.  Doing the 'Awwwwh' transfer of themes from the grown up first film to the likes of a save the little darling mija ideal here is simply a masking psychology.  A disinformation action.  If the film is rated R there is no reason for a child to even be in it.",0,2,Mists & Shadows,sIMChzE_aCo,0.05642620232172472,2018-03-21 02:01:54,True,True

2018-03-21T19:31:34,"Benicio Del Toro as the protagonist? Why? He was pretty much the villain in the first film.   A man who would do absolutely anything to exact horrifying, brutal vengeance upon the other terrible person who wronged him (this is an understatement). How does it make any sense to portray him as this hard, badass antihero who at his heart has good intentions? He's cruel and traded his humanity for bloody revenge because he had nothing left to lose.   I'm not saying the movie won't be good, hell, maybe it'll be fantastic like the first. I just don't know how I feel about the direction they're choosing to go with. Also, this is a trailer, and I know that trailers can misrepresent a film and make it seem less intelligent than it really is. Just watch the trailer for Children of Men and you'll know what I mean.   Also, ""Sicario, Day of the Soldado"" is an awful title. ""Soldado,"" has a perfect ring to it, just like Sicario. Plus, it very literally reflects the shift of Del Toro's character from hitman to soldier.

Not sure why they think that having him go from killing literally anyone that batted an eye his way in the first movie, to now risking his life to save some girl he just met (that I assume compromised a mission) would be a good idea for this movie. On top of that, instead of continuing the storyline of he and the equally badass josh brolin working together to create a top secret cartel killing team, they go to conflict with one another and it suddenly becomes an extremely generic action movie plot. The first movie was great because it made the viewer argue with themselves over whether or not they were ""good"" or ""bad"" because the whole plot was a huge ethical dilemma.

The girl that the sicario wants to save doesn't seem like she'll cut it in this sense, and, yes, as others have pointed out, this situation is a bit ironic considering he executed the kids in the first flick (maybe the point here will be that he's ""changing"" from a hell bent assassin to a ""good"" guy (?), but that does seem a bit ham-fisted and typically-Hollywood-predictable plot-wise)...anyway, we shall see.

First of all, I'm a huge fan of Taylor Sheridan screenwriting. ""Sicario"", ""Hell or High Water"" and ""Wind River"" are all very intense, meaningful, strong movies that I want to see again and again. But I'm deeply dissapointed with sequel of Sicario. I mean, Del Toro, Brolin and Keener are all excellent actors and sequel is not completely horrible on its own, but when I compare it with original and other Sheridan's works, it's falling short on many levels. It doesn't add anything to original and so much is missing, including Villeneuve and Deakins.

2018-09-12T17:18:44,"First of all, it's a stupid title. What does it mean ""Day of the Soldier"" because it's not about a day. OK, forget that.  The movie goes from an orgy of violence, bearded men screaming Alahu akbar (Man, am I ever sick of that stupid, overused phrase) with bombs busting everywhere. Then on to a raid of a Somali camp. Huh?  We're promised a gloves off war against the cartels, but instead we get an hour and a half of babysitting gone horribly wrong.  The movie started to go off the rails in the scene with the girls fighting at the school. Why do we need to see that? Answer: we don't. Why even have a kid actor in it for anything other than the bare minimum? She was terrible, like almost all kid actors. They gave her way, way, way, too much screen time which could have been used to give more important elements in the story a chance to speak, like her father, to name one.  So her father paid off the Mexican police to shoot the heck out of her convoy and her vehicle? Does he want her dead? That made no sense at all.  Once again, it suffers from the typical Hollywood disease of not making a whole lot of sense. There is no way they'd bring the girl to the USA. I guess they tried to address this in the video call with the Secretary of Defense when they said they ""didn't have the infrastructure in Mexico."" Pretty weak writing.  Oh my god, so the little gangbanger kid saw him once in a parking lot a few days earlier and recognizes him in a completely different context? Once again, a totally one in a billion coincidence is needed to carry the plot. And like Alejandro is even going to trust some idiot coyote to get him across the border? I thought they just told us that the cartels controlled all of the human trafficking? So why would he walk right into their territory?  And there is no reason on earth why the U.S. would kill the girl and the agent. It's just too stupid to believe. I thought the movie was going to be about causing a huge war among the cartels. It turned out to be about a guy babysitting a teenager.  ""She'll go into witness protection."" WHAT? That would make no sense at all.
