Lets look at the facts the narrator is steven hawkins if we shorten his name we have steve Hawk.  in the bible good book of acts we have Steve who is  with Peter, or Pete  preaching the word of God, to the people of the Gospel of  Jesus Christ.   After they preached for a good long time they were arrested for preaching to the people their, and people were also getting healed in the process of their preaching. Howe ever just like to day, not everyone experienced healing, because they truly did not believe what was happening, or they put their minds too much into science heals not God theory, for their own minds and intellect, that goes with those minds of wonder. Evidently, stupid wonder.   When they were arrested the next day when they were let go or weeks after they went out and preached the Gospel to the next city not giving up.  When Steve Hawk making his name short talks to zoolander dude icon. he is talking to an idiol and claiming the idiol is stupid but yet he refers him as an icon. Saul who becomes Paul before when he was Saul had Steven killed. Then or Stephen. Paul said behind every idol  which is also icon their is a devil King james 1611 in other bible versions a demon is behind the idol or icon.  The devil had a maiden name called Lucifer in the highest of Heavens he had his own Mansion he walked among the fiery stones and he was surrounded by different types  jewels, gold bronze silver, and diamonds and other things that we see here on earth to this day that people sale them selves to get a head in life. read up on this more and dont believe me take it from the word of God Isaiah 14:12.   for Lucifer is his Maiden name and it also identifies he is the serpent in the garden of eden who tempted adam and eve so now you know who Lucifer is.

Think of it like this, if I punch somebody (we all know this is wrong) then whoever believes in the Big Bang should think this is right because I just punched a clump of cells created out of nothing, for nothing, and because of nothing. God constitutes our purpose and morality; things that the Big Bang Theory cannot give nor provide. The movie ""God's not dead"" says that ""in the real world, we never see things jumping into existence out of nothingness, but [those who believe in the theory of evolution and the Big Bang theory, atheists], want to make one small exception to this rule, namely the universe and everything in it"".
