Adolescents cannot drink because they don't have the mental maturity and the decision making centers of their brains aren't fully developed enough to get inebriated.

Unsurprisingly she falls pregnant and one day the girl finds out just how much of a freak the guy is and she says that she's going to leave him and he doesn't take it too well. He moves in next door (killing her neighbours, he tells her that they moved away) and starts watching the girl from there, he starts haunting here and what not and he buries her husband I alive (if I remember correctly) and then he wants to kill her and they start fighting and what not, this skinny ass goth guy is pretty strong for some reason and somehow takes on both the girl and her husband and puts up a good fight but he loses eventually and dies, the girl's husband is in hospital and she says she's sorry and what not and they're basically back together. ",0,0,fleabag,Z_qN59GYZsc,0.16968201754385967,2014-11-14 21:43:53,True,True
