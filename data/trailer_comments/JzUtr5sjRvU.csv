2016-05-13T08:19:15,""" To survive out here you've got to out monster the monster"" is one of the tag lines to Triple 9 and it pretty much sums up this film.  It's a hard hitting thriller about a group of cops who are being blackmailed by the Russian mafia to pull off a robbery and the only way they can do it is set up a 999 as a distraction which in America means a man down but as usual not everything goes to plan. I really liked this film. It doesn't pull any punches and it had me involved from the very start . The story isn't complicated and the acting is first class. especially from Casey Affleck and Kate Winslet and I will go as far to say that this is the best thing I have seen her do. I'm not sure why this wasn't a bigger hit when it was first released , perhaps the timing didn't help but for me it's the best thing I have seen in a while.
