2014-08-07T20:44:42,"I have a personal theory that the thing most responsible for Dr. Hawking being alive today,more than anything else in his post diagnosis world, save for the exception of his wife, is that little computer. Not in any measurable way. It doesn't regulate any body part I'm aware of, except one. His mind! By giving him the ability to allow his ideas to escape.  Ask any creator or artist and they will tell you that the most distressing part of creating, is not being able to express the ideas that take hold of your mind and demand to be released into the world. The all consuming compulsion to have life charged into your thoughts by making them tangible in some way. Trust me Theoretical Physics and Mathematics take just as much creativity and abstract thinking as any song or painting. Look at the concept Einstein's theory of Special Relativity (E=MC²) presents, with such beauty and elegance, then tell me honestly you don't see art in it.  If Dr. Hawking was to be, not only bed ridden, immobilized, but silenced by his disease as well, I would imagine his life would have ended much earlier. Instead of the 100 years from now, where he will pass away as the result of being shot by the jealous husband of a 22 year old centerfold model. Like Dr. Hawking can help how sexy women find his big... brain!  Seriously though. I don't mean just his ability to describe a problem to those who assist him with his health. That may obviously be the difference in life and death, but that of his personal worth, gained from the mono-tone American accent of his computer.  I imagine this man is so full of thought and reasoning that his mind is even defying death itself. It is like his physical life is more horrifying than an H.R.Giger painting but still, he treks on. Not only because of his love for his wonderful and saintly wife but because he has purpose and with purpose comes drive. With drive you gain resolve and with resolve, life. He is here not just for himself and his loved ones but for us. Believing that this world is the only chance you get at existence. That with that belief, the closest you get to immortality is being remembered by the world for you deeds. I think his memory will always be that of a teacher. Just think of all the profound ways in which he teaches us. Not just in his field of study but in his life. All while never saying a word with his own breath. I admire, respect, and adore Hawking on each and every level we usually judge one another.",0,0,Corey Carnes,Salz7uGp72c,0.16443452380952378,2014-08-07 20:44:42,True,True

2014-08-07T23:48:11,"I don't understand why it's so incredibly hard for Hollywood to ACTUALLY make biopics about the discoveries, hardships, and struggles these scientists, engineers, doctors and businessmen faced when dealing with some sort of underlying scientific foundation. These scripts do not need to be spoon-fed or dumbed down for audiences, It needs to stick with a centralized and focused point about the person in question. This for example could've talked greatly about how Hawking came about with his theories regarding black holes and delve into such topics as Hawking Radiation, Black Hole Entropy, The Singularity or even the Information Loss Paradox which by the could tie nicely in with Hawking's feud with another famous physicist Leonard Susskind. But no, they've decided to make another ""Hollywood"" story that focuses more on Hawking's relationship with his wife Jane and how they both cope with his ALS probably for the sake of another emotional baggage love story.   Primer is a great example of what I'm talking  about. AND Shane Carruth, director and actor in the movie, actually has a background in software engineering and mathematics, so the way he presents his story is reflected through his script's technical dialogue which added a layer of depth to his story, which I personally loved.  If this is how keeps going with Jobs and now this, I'm just keen on the day they decide to make a biopic about Newton, Einstein, Darwin, Tesla, Bohr, Planck, Fleming, or even the great David Hilbert and have it NOT have to do ANYTHING with their personal struggle to find exactly what they wanted from their lifetime and what they wanted to achieve, and instead focus some other innocuous aspect about their life which deters so much away from what they actually accomplished that it almost gives the audience an entirely wrong perspective of the person they truly are and/or what the difficulties and struggles they went through to become some of the most well respected, most influential people in human history.  Fuck you Hollywood. I'm done.   Note: Despite all that I have said, this does look like a fairly well crafted movie, and I will probably go see it with my friends when it comes out. ",1,0,SFLOVER94,Salz7uGp72c,0.20515873015873015,2014-08-07 23:48:11,True,True

Another regurgitated, exaggerated, misinterpreted Hollywood-like mockery of a film, which will--probably--excel monetarily. Of course, all of this is speculation. Who knows, it may actually well be a decent film that encapsulates the essence, the persona of Stephen Hawking.

Could've been a proper film, if only they'd have stuck to the importance of his work and sidelined his personal affairs. Then again, what am I saying.

2014-08-16T03:46:36,"How is Hawking and his Ex-wife okay with their relationship being shown to the whole world? I would understand if one had passed away whilst they where married or something but they got a divorce and apparently a messy one. A major part of their relationship breaking down was due to publicity and fame. They have both been associated with different people during and after their marriage. Also Hawking has even had a second wife (I know about the abuse allegations, but I don't know enough to give any opinion on it). Also I love all the actors in this film, but it does look like a exact scene to scene reenactment of BBC Hawking for the start of the movie. And I can bet it will probably end with the cliched it all seeming very happy and so forth but then there will be the usual black screen with the basic small font quickly telling you 'the love story you just witnessed doesn't have a happy ending but we are going make it look that way so that more people will be interested and people who don't know anything about Hawking or didn't take there glasses don't read this message and we all carry on being stupid as hell because you believe anything you see on a screen.' If this film actually shows what really happened, that yes, they where very happy to begin with but as time progressed they where drawn apart and the pressure and fame became too much of a strain on their marriage that they had to split up, and only with years of distance and separation where they able to come together to begin to mend and heal their relationship, I will be very, very shocked and surprised. ",0,0,Nicole-Dawn Meek,Salz7uGp72c,0.13834229390681002,2014-08-16 03:46:36,True,True

I think it is hilarious that some people actually believe that if that happened, we would see a humanoid, bearded, robed, magical patriarch who would create mankind just so they would worship him or be tortured forever. Use your minds people. There is no evidence that supports this ""god"" hypothesis, yet people everywhere believe it. I'm not saying that is a bad thing, as people should have the right to believe what they want. I just wish people would expel these beliefs and look at them as what they truly are, myths. Myths created by man to explain what we do not know. Millions of years ago, people looked to the sky and wondered where rain came from, so they figured it must have been the rain god. No, we can now explain where precipitation comes from, and it is not god.

2014-09-08T15:30:15,"First of all it says so in the title The ""theory"" of everything. All Mr hawking has done is dedicate his life to nothing more than theories. Has any one of those theories ever been proven through actual application? NO. Do you understand why? Because it takes theorems and complicated mathematics based on things they only think they can understand. Just because Darwin sailed to an island in the 1800's and observed some finches with no actual scientific proof does not mean evolution exists. Just because an apple fell on Issac newtons head doesn't mean that gravity exists. Just because someone came up with an idea and everyone at the time accepted it and perpetuated the lie does not mean its true. Given a long enough span of time you can say anything about history and people will accept it. Look at Atlantis, its a fictional place mentioned once in a paragraph hundreds of years ago as an allegory for the brazen ineptitude of the ruling empires at the time and how they would eventually fall under their own hubris. Yet we still have television programs and ""educated"" scholars believing it exists and stupidly spending money on expeditions. THE BIBLE has been proven beyond any shadow of any doubt to have happened and to have existed. Everything, from prophecy to person to place to thing can be substantiated. I dont need theories or as I call them LIES to tell me about the world. The bible goes over everything. From society,law,ethics,money ect. We would be much more advanced as a society in our complete knowledge if we just followed one book and its not a breif history of time. The bible tells you about the past,present and yes even THE FUTURE. I strongly encourage you to try and poke holes in it.",1,7,TheMpo1986,Salz7uGp72c,0.08916666666666667,2014-09-08 15:30:15,True,True

2014-09-28T07:49:44,"So I think there are many commenters here who confuse the notion of true love with eternal connection. Just because a relationship doesn't last until death doesn't mean that for the time that a couple was together, it wasn't true love. Circumstances change all the time that make people fall in and out of love. This would be analogous to saying that after 20 years of driving a reliable and dependable car that never broke down, the second it breaks down it was never a good car for the entire time you drove it. No, it was a well-functioning car until it wasn't, just like how love is love until is ceases being love. You're lying to yourself if you throw out the good times with the inevitable bad ones.  ",0,0,Arnold Rotundo,Salz7uGp72c,0.16980994152046786,2014-09-28 07:49:44,True,True

Nevertheless, adapted from the memoir of his first wife, this movie is more about his private life and Lou Gehrig's disease than academia or theoretical physics. It plays like a well-produced TV movie, though now we get to see how he acquired his robotic voice and ability to type 4 words a minute (imagine writing a physics book at that speed while his mind is still moving at lightspeed). The title itself is ironic since he is no longer pursuing the Theory of Everything that binds quantum mechanics and general relativity, according to his latest book ""Grand Design"". Then again, the movie stops at the book tour of his first popular book (actually most unread best seller of all time), ""A Brief History of Time"".

Nothing, nothing can harm you when you're dead, because there isn't a god, so whatever you do, you can't be judged, hurt, or bother anyone else or be bothered when you're dead according to atheism.

2015-01-11T14:33:05,"''Religion'' was a tool to control violence and illegal activity in the first stages of our society(ies). Through the stories of mischief and lawbreaking we have formed our moral values to improve the world we live in. The ""Holy Books"" were full of metaphors, to understand in a non literal manner (maybe at the time for scare mongering).  From throwing upon murder, stealing, sexual orientation (primitive laws), we improved and continued to improve our morals. Fleshing out the quirks and impurities. From the study of behavior of others and understanding the world in greater knowledgeable this created 'Science' of today. With the thousands of years refining and improving upon our laws and morals we have what lays now, the modern society. In todays world the ""Holy Books"" are simply no longer relevant. We have formed the society and upgraded to much better methods of maintaining this society. We have learned that equality is important, the ability to share our lives with the ones who we love regardless of sexual orientation is something we should be able to choose freely, that we all come from the space place, the universe and the stars.  Bible is outdated and should not be taken to such a degree where peoples lives are formed and narrowed to limited opportunities of life. Basing our values on outdated content is dangerous. We live in world that is rapid, growing at an exponential rate. A world filled with technology to aid us and help us improve. In the world of scientists, teachers, doctors, engineers, technology experts, professional society workers (plumbers ,electricians, geologists, animal menders etc). We have ""grown up"" but are still in need of ""growing up"".  In hundreds of years to come, todays world will seem barbaric and outdated, just as the past seems now. Our current morals, beliefs and knowledge will be outdated but still followed by many, the ones that forget to adapt and keep up.  The world is improving, keep up to date with it or you will fall out from the touch of presence and become irrelevant. Spirituality is your personal connection to the world, however delusion and ignorance is your worst enemy. Knowledge is the key but spirituality brings us in connection with the people we love and the universe we live in. We are conditioned by our societies since the first steps that we have made into this world. What may seem right now will seem wrong in the future, whether those are the laws or the knowledge and understanding of our place here we live evolve.  The point being.

Hypothetically, let's imagine this particular point in time, anywhere in the universe/multiverse/etc. If no intelligent life is currently existing, then intelligence itself cannot exist, and therefore an intelligent creator cannot exist. Given that certain objects such as galaxies, stars, and particularly planets/moons must exist before life itself can form and subsequently evolve into some form of intelligence, then it must also be true that an intelligent creator could not yet have been present to create the universe and objects within it such as galaxies, stars, planets/moons, etc. Therefore, the universe itself (or multiverse) and anything within it which existed before the existence of life, could not have been created by a god, AND, life itself could not have been created by a god since life must first evolve before becoming intelligent. Unless, of course, there is some way for intelligence to exist without anything having first existed, or unless there there is some way for intelligence to exist spontaneously without any form of life having first existed.  But let's be honest with ourselves here, does that really sound plausible? I mean REALLY think about it, and think about how the idea of a creator even came into existence during man's early history. Do you REALLY think it's that likely? Anyhow, I am not saying definitively whether or not an intelligent creator exists; I am simply using logic to imply that such a creator would be extremely unlikely.   Now, please do not leave hateful comments; let us not blur our thoughts with negative emotions. If you would like to refute this, or offer proofs/ideas/suggestions which you think are capable of deconstructing my logic, then I would be more than happy to hear them and engage in some intellectual debate in a gentlemanly manner.

I mentioned that maybe we could watch it as a family, since we don't do that very often... And she just said, ""Well... He's a pretty outspoken *atheist*..."" And that was that.    It really opened my eyes to see how even the most loving, caring people you know can be corrupted by religion. I know my mother is an amazing, loving person who raised me the right way and does all she can for me, but just saying the word ""atheist"" made her cringe as if she smelled something disgusting and vile. How can she see a story as touching and inspiring as this, and just totally ignore its beauty because Hawking thinks differently than she does? Well, religion is just about the only way that could happen, and it's made me dislike religion as a whole even more. Stupid intolerance and willful ignorance have ruined so much for society, and it pisses me off that it still goes on in the TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY.

The second, like it, is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’” (Matthew 22:37-39)  Love is the unifying theory of everything. Even Dr. Hawkin's search for a unifying theory of everything is motivated by love. Without love nothing would exist. Without love nothing would be created. Life is an act of love and only an Almighty God of love would be capable of bringing everything we see and do not see into existence. (1 John 4:8)  * And before you say Jehovah is responsible for the world you see today, know that this world is not God's creation. It is in fact Satan's. (1 John 5:19) We know that we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. Love is what compelled Jehovah God to send his son to die so that everyone has a chance to live.  (John 3:16) “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.",0,0,kxmode,Salz7uGp72c,0.3617259552042161,2015-02-24 08:17:33,False,False

While there’s life, there is hope."" - Stephen Hawking  Just finish watching this enormously inspirational film. It touched my heart and watered my eyes during multiple scenes. I believe that anybody, like myself, after watching this film will admire Dr. Stephen Hawking by the bottom of your heart. However, more than Hawking, my utmost respect goes to the woman that stood behind him for 30 years, gave birth to his 3 children, and greatly sacrificed the most beautiful years of her life for his massive success.   I have a cousin who was born with impaired hearing, speaking, and mobility. He has the sweetest and most benevolent soul that I have ever known in my life. However, he often feels hopeless and down and that life is not fair to him even though his condition is much better and more fortunate than Hawking's. I want to share this film with him and everybody else who wants to give up on something. If Stephen Hawking can overcome what life throws at him and succeeds what he has done for the humanity, YOU can overcome your whatever obstacles. Yes, YOU can do that!   And don’t you ever feel that life is not fair! This reminds me of a saying from my old folks, “The Creator is very fair. He doesn’t give someone everything nor take everything from someone.” Hawking is given a brilliant mind and many compassionate people around him throughout his life. On the other hand, his simplest abilities for living are taken away from him. To achieve whatever goals of your life, you need to appreciate and utilize what you are given, not what you wish you had. Hawking realized that, he seized that, and he became who he is now. Remember: no one has everything or lose everything; just look around you more carefully, you will find things or reasons to keep you up.   Strongly recommend this film to anybody. Eddie Redmayne did a very good job playing Stephen Hawking. No wonder he got the Oscars Award for Best Actor in 2014. ",0,0,tragon7121,Salz7uGp72c,0.28664930555555557,2015-03-01 02:44:13,False,False

It's okay if you don't believe in God, and remember, most of the greatest of scientists and mathematicians like Albert Einstein and Darwin(before he died, he did not want his followers to produce his manuscripts because he claimed it was all a lie.) did believe in God. So to ridicule people who believe in something is just ridiculous. People ask me, how do you there is a god? Well, because I was desperate and I searched for God with all my heart and with everything I had, and I found him. I found him with faith, see, without faith you cannot see God. Faith is a SUBSTANCE of things hoped for, faith is also a revelation. In the Christian world, you cannot know God if you don't have faith. That's because, God has to REVEAL or UNVEIL himself to you for you to know that He is real. And no, God does not have to come in human form to you. When He reveals himself to you, it will be so simple that you might even miss it if you were not paying attention. He can come as a thought, a sign, a dream, or even come down from heaven himself so you can see, depending on the size of you FAITH in him, if you have so much faith in Him, he won't have to come in his fullness, He will just reveal himself to you in a thought that will trouble you for even years. But God will never ever show himself to anyone who just halfheartedly is looking for him. NEVER, you can scream God never exists, but if you have never searched Him the way you search for science to find all your answers, you will never be real, and you will never acquire faith to believe in Him. After all, the whole Christian way of living is with faith, because without faith, you cannot go to heaven, you cannot believe God, you cannot please God, and simply, you cannot be saved and forgiven. Faith remember is also a revelation. And if you find God, he will reveal to you what salvation means, and you will understand exactly why God had to die on the cross.",0,0,the LOGICian - theBeofox,Salz7uGp72c,0.0978395061728395,2015-03-11 00:33:19,False,False

Just because it is filled with courage, genius, adversity, tragedy and no doubt good acting, isn't going to make it interesting. This film would never have been made without the fact that the main character happens to suffer from a progressive disease. It is in that respect an exploitation movie. Hawking and his wife may not in fact be very interesting people and aside from his disease and popularist publications, nobody would really be aware of Hawking. People with far greater reputations than Hawking and with much more varied and interesting private lives than he, such as Einstein, Halley, Newton, Galileo, Tesla, Edison, Oppenheimer or Feynman would have been better candidates. Sadly these films would have been about personalities and ideas rather than a domestic situation. Hawking isn't even a Nobel Prize winner and never invented anything. It's annoying when people get all excited about that-there science. People with an education quickly switch Brian Cox off for being deeply patronising by not only dumbing-down but presuming that other people know absolutely nothing. He even repeated the myth about Newton and the Apple, a myth, but happy to take the money for it. The very idea of somebody being a professor in their 40s twenty years ago would have been laughable, because they simply would have not published enough to make that grade. There are lots of perfectly good documentaries about Hawking around, but they don't make money or win Oscars the way a film aimed at people who need to go to the cinema to feel emotions safely separated from their own lives do.",0,0,Stefan G,Salz7uGp72c,0.21123737373737375,2015-03-12 02:05:39,False,False

Communism killed people who were harmless to everyone, because they liked to close their eyes and whisper.

Also not only did his first marriage fail but his second one too. And to top it all off the poor man has difficulties breathing requiring a ventilator at all times.

Never mind that the mathematics behind the three types of big bang universes contradicts the four types of black hole universes which never match any of the big bang universes & contradict each other no matter the combination.  On Youtube, see mathematician Steven Crothers at the Electric Universe conference destroy the mathematical inconsistencies & bogus assumptions (e.g. dividing by zero as an expression of infinity) of Hawking, Penrose, & Einstein, as well as, Dr. P. M. Robitaille's nullification of Kirchoff's Law on which the Planck constant is derived &, in turn,  on which Einstein's relatvity is derived, thus nullifying the claims of both Planck & Einstein.

2017-07-31T12:49:34,"The theory of everything is the sun: the sun heats and heats up and by the action of sending out heat,it produces its own nucleus and builds pressure inside of it. And when the sun heats,it releases pressure from the nucleus to the shell/covering. These steps are called 'pulse of heat' (beating of heat emanating from the sun). Our hearts make pulses of heat; engines make pulses of heat; lamps make pulses of heat; batteries make pulses of heat. Everything that consumes energy,sends out pulses of heat! This is also the reason why you see the nucleus and rings that the sun pruduces everywhere in nature. For example, when you throw a stone into a body of water, at the place where the stone lands, we see the shape of a nucleus and the rings emanating outward from the nucleus. The form of all living things is also a core(heart) And a circle(covering/skin). The shape of a plant also contains a nucleus(of the plant seed) and an encircling(shell of the fruit or stem leaves of the flower.

I know that Stephen Hawking once said ,,People who boast about their IQs are stupid."" But I doubt that Stephen Hawking has IQ 160. Stephen Hawking has IQ from 160-180. And IQ 180 he should have only because his own uniqueness, exceptionality and remarkability. I wish Stephen Hawking an infinity, eternity of time, space, knowledge, love, joy, life, humour, stoicism, optimism, wisdom, peace, fame, glory...

2018-03-16T00:48:32,"Sorry i dont want to waste anyone's time but I just need to share my story.  Sometimes when I'm at school I like to separate myself from the rest of my class. Not by walking away but just by stop listening to the sounds around me and stop looking at the things around me. Normaly I look outside to the trees, the birds and the big , undiscovered sky above me.. but I didn't look at it two days ago. Two days ago I looked at a big poster on the wall for half an hour without looking away; 'The Theory of Everything' it said. I knew it was a movie before. But that day, two days ago I couldn't get my eyes of the poster. I looked Into eddies eyes, wandering away in my own thoughts. A few hours later, after dinner, I had to study for my math exam but I just couldn't stay focussed. My mind was with the poster and I felt like I had to watch it before continuing with my normal life. That night I couldn't sleep so I opened my window. I looked up and I had never seen a sky like that before. I saw more stars than ever before and they shined brighter than ever before. I started thinking: 'what is everything?' At that moment I opened my laptop and I put on this movie. I'll be honest with you all. I was very very touched. I laughed but I also had tears in my eyes because I was sad. Especially when I saw the scene where Jane said that she had loved Stephen, and Stephen started crying, I felt so bad. At that moment my phone vibrated, of course I didn't take a look at it because I was so focussed on the movie. But at the end, when I had just seen his life backwards. And the beautiful credit music started, I looked out my window again with the tears still in my eyes. Than I grabbed my phone and I saw this one pop up in my screen. 'Stephen Hawking passed away'.   I was shocked. I was angry but. I was crying like a little baby. I changed. I wanted to go and live my life to it's fullest potential. I wanted to Discover the universe, and find the meaning of it all. Please, if you are still reading. Noting and noone can stop you from being the person that you want to be. Please, don't try to be popular and don't be afraid to be yourself. You can only find answers about life if you live how you want to live. Thanks, good luck.

He said Stephan Hawkins was his role model but when he died some told him he is the creator of the big bang theory. Freind proceeds in saying he's not his role moldel due to faith and shruggs off his death by saying god will forgive him for being foolish and accept him for his of over coming his obstacles. I sat there dumbfounded because he had no idea what it means to have a different point of view on the world and not everything is black-and-white for faith.

I thought, cool, I can watch watch this for like all day. So, I put down my pencil and my sketch pad, mainly focus on the device, and watch it. I realized, it was the life of Stephen Hawking! Cool! I nver knew that he had this kind of life. Sad, happy, etc. He inspired me to love Science even more because at my 1st year of High School, one of my weaknesses is Science, along with Math. I then started to research about his life and his studies. I watched the movie over, and over, and over again. I even followed Eddie's other films like Fantastic Beast and Where To Find Them, etc. It was so spectacular to make a movie just like that. A week before my final exam in 1st year High School, I studied and studied and studied. Of course especially at Science. In my head was like, 'Yes, Science! I learned everything for me! Thanks, Mr. Hawking! ' I also watched the movie, even tge behind the scenes. But the day after, as I was browsing the best side of YouTube, this videi showed up. 'The Final Words Of Stephen Hawking'. I was like, what? That couldn't be happening,right? I click on the video. It was said he dued on March 14th of 2018 (or something), tge exact day I studied for Science. I feel all of the things that are heavy weigh me down like an ant being weighed down by a huge rock. No. This can't be happening. How?! I feel like I loss so much power and life. On the day of the exam at Science, I couldn't forget what I've heard. But most importantly I can't forget what have he done to the society. He helped people who have difficulties ib understanding about space and time. I still can't believe that he is dead now. In fact, Stephen died like a hero.  R. I. P.  Stephen Hawking.

Now another thing , i believe of aliens, now here's why if we are in this HUGE multiverse, logically it wasnt made for us only to discover,people recently discovered that theres O2 in mars then this means that theres life but mars doesnt have anyone on it but they never ever discovered what in inside mars, i believe that inside mars there are living beings , beings that think,act and feel like us .if u want to think deeper and believe that the multiverse theory is real, then i believe that god is just making us like experiments for him if there are aliens because god wouldnt make aliens that are not more advanced than us , because after all god isnt an idiot if u know what im saying, so aliens are existed if not in this universe its in another one. thank you for everyone who is reading this and please spread this message,im not looking for fame, i just want everyone to know this, thank you and have a great day.",1,1,Maryam Saleh,Salz7uGp72c,0.13017857142857145,2018-05-20 22:04:36,False,False

I am going to send you a link where you can see a picture that he doesn't have any teeth kacky so all these years he had gum disease and gum disease has been eating on him and that's why he died!!!  That's why he was sick all of his life life!!! His  dentist did not cure his gum disease and just let all of his teeth rot out and which made him sick all of his life!!!   So his Dentist and Doctors could work and  some money off of his teeth and sickness all of his life!!!  Whoooo that's outrageous!!!  And is CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!! Larry Hey all of you beautiful PEOPLE OUT THERE, I WANT YOU TO NEVER EVER, EVER GET ANOTHER CAVITY OR GET SICK OR DIE OF GUM DISEASE!!! GUM DISEASE IS WHATS ON MY MIND!!! I WANT TO STOP THE DENTIST AND DOCTOR'S CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ALL AROUND THE WORLD!!!   Don't let your DENTIST, DOCTOR or GUM DISEASE SLOWLY ROB you of ALL of your TEETH your HEALTH and your LIFE!  All because they didn't cure your GUM DISEASE IN THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU FIRST GOT YOUR GUM DISEASE!!!  REAL NICE GUYS A!!! Go to YouTube and type in (cure your gum disease, periodontal disease before it kills you YES YOU)  Under this video it tells you where you can buy CLINDAMYCIN!!  It ALSO tells you what you need to know about Clindamycin!! Then type in to view the next video (is YOUR dentist ripping you off.)  Is he ever!!!  Here you will see for yourself,  FOR SURE!!  FOR SURE!!  THAT THE DENTISTS AND DOCTORS ARE OUT AND OUT RIP OFFS, THIEVES, FELONS, CRIMINALS!!  Running their SICK deadly SCAM that equals CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY!!! Next video is (Dr. Modovan on the Doctors Show Treating Periodontal Disease) IN THIS VIDEO THEY SAY THAT THERE ARE 65 MILLION PEOPLE WHO  HAVE GUM DISEASE AND MOST OF THEM DON’T EVEN KNOW THEY HAVE GUM DISEASE!!!  (THE QUESTION IS WHY DON’T THESE PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THIS, THE DEADLIEST DISEASE IN THE WORLD???  GUM DISEASE!!!) Its killing everyone on EARTH!!! (BECAUSE THEIR DENTIST DID NOT TELL THEM THAT THEY HAVE GUM DISEASE AND THAT WITH GUM DISEASE THEY ARE GOING START LOSING THEIR TEETH AND GET SICK AND DIE FROM IT!!!  REAL NICE GUYS!!  Also at the start of the video he said that he was told that he had EXTRA  BLEEDING!!  (THIS TELLS YOU HIS DENTIST KNEW ALL ALONG (FOR YEARS AND YEARS) THAT HIS DENTIST KNEW THAT HE HAD GUM DISEASE AND DID NOT CURE HIM WITH CLINDAMYSIN!!!  Just view the X-RAYS and you will be able to see the the major bone DAMAGE around his teeth!!!  This guy said that he brushes his teeth three times a day, flosses two times a day, goes to the dentist three times a year to have his Teeth cleaned and STILL has major damage (EVEN HAD AN ABSCESS which is DEADLY in its SELF) to his bone around his teeth (GUM DISEASE) and his dentist did not tell him that he had gum disease and his dentist KNEW for years that he had GUM DISEASE and did not tell him.  (How would the dentist know?  (SWOLLEN GUMS and x-rays)  The dentist just sat back and let the damage HAPPEN!!  So he (THE DENTIST) could make a lot of MONEY filling all of the THOSE CAVITIES etc. that you can see when he opens his mouth!!!!  If the dentist would have given him CLINDAMYCIN when his gum disease first started he would still have all of his beautiful white permanent to this very DAY!! (Here in the below video you will see what GUM DISEASE DOES TO YOUR HEART!!! GUM DISEASE IS THE (ONLY REASON) PEOPLE HAVE HEART ATTACKS AND DIE!!!) Video name is (periodontal disease can lead to HEART DISEASE) Also type in (Cure, Schizophrenia, Psychiatry, Bipolar, Psychological Disorder) ITS GUM DISEASE THAT IS CAUSING PEOPLE TO BECOME CRAZY AND NOTHING ELSE! Next Video (gum disease narrated)  Man Oh MAN, This video will explain it all, the real TRUTH about GUM DISEASE by examining an EXPLAINING the X-RAYs of someone that has a severe CASE of GUM DISEASE!!  (gum disease narrated) Must SEE video!! Next Video (gum disease)  This video, is a video of my ARTICLE that tells you HOW and WHAT I went through while I was under ATTACK of GUM DISEASE!!  You will know it's my video when it say Larry Neiderhiser. Another must see video is.  (Periodontal Disease, Heart Disease Port Rowan Care Dental)  There are lots of OTHER videos out there that tell that Gum Disease causes other diseases! LIKE HEART ATACKS!! ETC.  ETC.  ETC. If you have gum disease and don't get CURED you are FOR SURE, FOR SURE going to die Early and die a miserable death!! This will save your life!  And end the doctors and dentist SCAM of not CURING YOU OF GUM DISEASE AND NOT telling you about gum disease and how deadly it is!! Look out!! GUM DISEASE, (PERIODONTAL DISEASE) is GOING TO KILL YOU if not cured!!  For Sure, FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!!! Your dentist is a crook just like the rest of the dentists!  If he did not GIVE YOU CLINDAMYSIN TO CURE YOUR GUM DISEASE HE IS JUST LETTING THE GUM DISEASE BACTERIA EAT YOU UP !!",0,0,Larry Neiderhiser,Salz7uGp72c,0.048589132918792514,2018-07-05 19:03:12,False,False

Just like how mandelbrot set works, it starts with a simple mathematical equation where you can execute in any programming language, you get more and more details as you iterate through the equation. Our understandings are only limited to our sensory organs, and the things we perceive are only the by-product of first execution of the specific equation. This was just a philosophical approach to the origin of everything and an attempt to explain what happened just before the big bang occured, to sum it up all, the initial fractal pattern that was originated from the equation caused an infinite set of fractal branches what we call ""the big bang"", every first fractal branches that's originated from the first body fractal is a universe and the other branches that's originated from these ""universe fractal branches"" are the matter, ""matter"" branches ramify to what we perceive, the material, the third dimension.

For a long time I had planned to see this movie, (mostly because Eddie Redmayne is my favorite actor since 2012 when I saw him in Les Miserables) but it never happened ,you know what I mean? This year I finally decided to watch it,  and I loved it! It was like I got to know Stephen, sure I had heard of him before, but I suddenly learned so much more. I was completely blown away by this story, and the music was something extremely powerful that I always cried to, and I couldn’t stop listen to it. About 2 days later the news were everywhere, and it for real broke my heart. Stephen is no longer with us, but I think he’s sitting up there somewhere, still exploring the universe💫✨ He was a brilliant man, he knew what he was doing and had a head that is too unbelievable to understand. I feel kind of cursed because of this, how can he pass away 2 days later, just when I got to know him??...
