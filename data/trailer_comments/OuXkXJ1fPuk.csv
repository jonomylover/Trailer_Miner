Jetzt mal ehrlich: Arnold Schwarzenegger hätte ein mächtiges Problem gehabt in ""The last stand"", wenn es kein green screen gäbe. Stallone hätte blöd aus der Wäsche geschaut in Rambo, wenn er tatsächlich vor einer ""zweite Weltkriegsbombe"" hätte wegrennen dürfen. Natürlich ist vieles nicht mehr das, was es mal war, aber ist deshalb alles schlecht? Nein! Im Gegenteil! Es ist eine Hilfe für Filmemacher, dass sie nicht Megasets bauen müssen, um sie danach in die Luft zu jagen. Anderes Beispiel: Du bist Produzent. Du bist Filmemacher. Du willst einen Film machen, hast aber nicht so viel Geld, also was machen? Na klar! Green Screen! Man kann wundervolle Dinge schaffen, die es so nicht gibt, man kann Explosionen erzeugen und die Darsteller fliegen lassen, aber ohne dass sie sich davor fürchten müssen gleich bei einer Panne zerfetzt zu werden!

Then some stupid line that makes reference to that happens. There is no REAL guy films anymore.  I really don't have any interested in women kicking ass in a movie. Chic flicks never change(Some even man bash). But action films do. Don't enjoy action or horror films as result. To predictable with that nonsense. Thought these films would be for REAL men.  But no they add a woman and women won't see these films(Unless they want to see a guy they like in it). ,0,5,timeknowsfilms,OuXkXJ1fPuk,0.027380952380952395,2014-01-20 10:31:27,True,True
