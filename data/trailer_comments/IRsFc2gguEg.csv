2018-06-05T23:36:56,"I am a MASSIVE fan of the books and have pretty much always had at least one of Philip Reeve's books on the go since I started reading Mortal Engines, so you can be pretty sure that I'll love this film too... However I have to say that the changes that appear to have been made don't seem to be good. Some minor things (no guild marks, potentially no David Shaw, etc.) don't REALLY matter, though could become relevant as the story continues past this point, but the more major things worry me. Overall the aesthetic is fantastic, I can't help feel that London (and indeed the cities in general) look a little small. Scrivener's moon has description of truly vast structures within a small section of the GUT of London (the very bottom tier, where the jaws open into) and that was in an unfinished version of the city, hundreds of years before the events of the original book. It also almost looks too consistent, a key feature of municipal darwinism (the whole philosophy of traction cities) is that, after a successful chase, the predator city will break apart and use its prey to expand itself. There are several small cities that do exactly that in Mortal Engines, indeed Salthook looks very nice in this trailer, but something about London itself just feels off. I could go into detail about most of the rest of the things in here, but that'd be tedious. There is one major, MAJOR problem with this film though and that's Hester Shaw. Her 'scar' here is almost pretty, like it's a fashion accessory. In the books she is actively extremely ugly. 'A terrible scar ran down her face from forehead to jaw, making it look like a portrait that had been furiously crossed out. Her mouth was wrenched sideways in a permanent sneer, her nose was a smashed stump, and her single eye stared at him out of the wreckage.' This is what Hester SHOULD look like. I am immensely worried about the appearances of characters from later in the series if Hester has been made somewhat pretty. Imagine... What if Pennyroyal has some fashion sense, instead of being a more futuristic 6th doctor? What if Smew is a normal height? What if (and this is, potentially, even more important than Hester's appearance) Shrike isn't a towering, terrifying, titan? Despite my concerns, I'm still extremely excited for December...

Hester Shaw (the woman that tries stabbing the guy in the trailer) is supposed to be ugly. That scare she has is supposed to have taken half her nose and 1 eye. This is important because Thomas (the guy that us chasing Hester) has to kinda get over her hideous appearance. She is also vary rude. Ok i have some spoilers so ""SPOILER WARNING!!!"" ..............  Valentine (the man Hester tries to kill)  killed Hesters mother and tried to kill her when she was like 8 years old. He failed in killing Hester but succeeded killing her mother and scaring Hester's face. Hester's mother went to the Waste land (North America) and found the construction blue prints and all the necessary information to to build a nuclear Bomb to which they name Medusa. The predator Cities like London prey on smaller cities the people who suppprt these ""Mobile Cities"" are called ""Tractionists"" those who oppose are called ""Anti-Tractionists"" there are some people who still live in Permanente Cities, some who live in Floating Cities and some who live in Flying Cities. The wheeled Predator Cities have soldiers called ""Stalkers"" stlakers are men who have been killed amd resurrected combimed man and machine, they become cyborgs. They feel no pain and have no emotions. They do not need to eat, drink, sleep or rest. I do believe they have to recharge their power source but they are scary as fuck in the books. In the book Hester almost volunteers to become a Stalker. Thomas stops her. Anyways thats what the movie is based on and a out line of the story and some character motivations.

Furthermore, Hester in the books was pointedly hideous to look at. She was described as such. She had one eye and no nose, and this was shocking for my ten-year-old self, as it was to the protagonist. It was a subversion of expectation. And Hester's ugliness was part of her character development, having to come to terms with it, yet being a compelling and capable protagonist in spite of it. Jackson has really given this Hester the old Hollywood upgrade. The 'Tyrion treatment', if you will.  Also, weren't Hester and the male (forget his name; Tom?) children, or at most adolescents in the book? Shows like Game of Thrones aged up the protagonists so they could be depicted having sex without breaking any laws, but why do it here? So as to not have this movie come across as 'for kids'?

EDIT: *HESTER SHAW IS SUPPOSED TO BE HIDEOUS*   ""A terrible scar ran down her face from forehead to jaw...Her mouth was wrenched sideways in a permanent sneer, her nose was a smashed stump and her single eye stared at him out of the wreckage..."" Credit to the one guy who reminded me of this   FIRST- Hester Shaw never got a hit on Valentine and was interrupted by Tom.                At the end of the chase Hester gives Tom her name before jumping off by herself. There was no clich√© 'hold onto hand tell him this' scene                Valentine is actually human and kind, but has to do things for London that he indeed regrets, he isn't full bad guy unlike how the movie              paints him as he ledges Tom.               At the ledge scene there were supposed to be _many_ witnesses including London guards and an engineer, Pod               Who the hell is that woman Valentine speaks to? (Unless she's the one that sends out Shrike)              The _Jenny Haniver_ ship is meant to be a culmination of tonnes of seperate parts of ships that Anna took as a child, not some amazing              professionally built red ship               1:32-136             They did not meet this way at all...              EGHHH? Anna Fang was not looking for Hester and had no Idea what the Medusa did.               The rest was complete BS as it completely steers off course completely.            Anna Fang was supposed to be dead by then.            Hester could not give a single damn about London.            Tom doesnt want to kill anybody.

A Few Good Men?  Jesus of Nazareth?  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence?  Probably NOT, but guess what....neither is %90 of movies that are made!  You think maybe the bar has been raised just a weeee bit too high?  And just another random comment......Who cares about whether or not a movie is faithful to the book?  Only someone who needs a hobby or a girlfriend.   I watched Jack Nicholson scorch the screen in the Shining before I read the book, and guess what?....the book was a whooooole lot different than the movie.  Did it diminish my love for that movie?..uh, no.     I just think folks get a little too worked up about some things, especially things that are meant to be entertaining.  I sit around with my family, eating chocolate chip cookies and watching movies.  We don't have a notepad, taking notes on plot holes and crap or shredding a movie because it's 'unbelievable'!    Gees, wasn't Star Wars unbelievable back in the day?  Has nobody else thought to themselves one freakun time that Brody could have just injected some potassium cyanide into a big ol bloody piece of Bonita and threw it out there and killed the dadgum shark without having to go through all the Hell they faced in Jaws!!??

Perhaps there are too many characters in this film, sometimess less is more. E.G. Howls Moving Castle did just fine with Howl, Sophie, a boy, the witch, and a talking fire. And Howl was an interesting character you don't often see, a powerful wizard but a vain pretty-boy who has a meltdown when he dies his hair the wrong colour.   In a western real life film, he would have been yet another musclebound, shaved head, stubbled meathead with a gruff voice and no personality that we have all seen 100 times before.   Plus they all have that slightly panicked, a little sarcastic, really serious voice that every single character in every single modern film has these days. (like Rey in the new Star Wars films, as it adds ""drama"") - Howl was a more likable, more realistic character than any of them despite being a cartoon boy.",0,1,ÍßÅMike SullyÍßÇ,IRsFc2gguEg,0.13621526323139224,2018-11-21 23:14:09,True,True

Valentine's betrayal alone is a pretty big turning point in the books, even if it happens very early on. They didn't have to show that in the trailer. And lots of people have mentioned it already, but it's still relevant. Hester is supposed to be ugly. Really ugly. That's an important plot point - Tom gradually learns to look beyond pure aesthetics and learns to love the person. Hester is an oddly unique character in YA fiction, because everyone in YA fiction is objectively attractive. A scar does not make you ugly, but the way Hester is described really does (isn't she missing her nose?!). Hollywood just can't resist. It really doesn't think we can root for a character who isn't what most people would consider attractive. It's one of the reasons I love films like Under the Skin - Adam Pearson's character, beyond disfigured, is someone who understands the importance of character over beauty.

Like the time of year it came out, the star power, little known IP etc.  This movie is bad start to finish. The plot is so full of holes it's insane. Everything that happens is predicated on a man...who refuses to acknowledge that  immobile, traditional settlements are  things to respect. In fact he is willing to kill his wife, first daughter, abandon second daughter, so that he can have a weapon? to tear down a wall? So his mobile city can continue ingesting mobile cities? Because......why.? He really is committed..to what? (What?) Who greenlit this script? Quit your job.  Every single character is combination, poorly portrayed, not fleshed out, actual identity unknown, forgotten about at various times. Why should I care about characters the film makers don't respect enough to even construct them to the point that they can be called characters actually.  The being saved, but sold into slavery scene, literally could not have been more predictable.  There is only one small town that gets ingested and it's anticlimactic. The one thing the moviemakers thought would sell this ...thing. They do it once in the first 5 minutes, then hunker down for an hour plus of nonsense.   This is the definition of a horrible movie.

Desperate, desolate, dead morals using key - people! - to ruin their lives in seeming cults of culinary advantages as tastes in order to strip us physically to the brink of a lower dimension are hopeless.  You can't win by supporting a vast simplified concept of a force.  We could just as easily program an unimaginably beautiful, pleasant consciousness into the valued laws and principles of higher ethics that way.  There's danger, and that's why I state it more than an easier jealously enjoined free for all.  Morality has to and would - if you studied all this right - include other species as they are.     I think there's a moral principle against promoting using creation apart from authority as the means except! as happily.  That's not always enough to deter even going that far as motives and limits, but happiness is a limit in two ways.  Happiness often embrasses people.  In that way, of not being free enough, and in the too competitive sense of going too far even when there's happiness, are the 2 errors.  The 7th general negative characteristic is to ignore right and wrong.  As a happier day dawns, why reject it?

I only invoke the star wars reference because he of course decided to throw in a ""Luke I am your father"" moment that was obvious even from the onset of this dumpster fire. Don't worry though he didn't spend the whole film stealing from Disney's Star Wars, he also dug up a character from one of the Matrix sequels to fly an airship he found on the old set of waterworld.

Hugo Weaving is great and the female protagonist is definitely handled a lot better than most of what we get these days.  I think the biggest problem with it is they don't take the time to flesh out this world they've made.  They never really explain what the nature of this world is so you kind of have to guess for yourself as you go along.  It's apparently based on a book series so it's like they made it just for those who have read it rather than the average filmgoer.

2020-04-30T01:05:41,"Why did ""Mortal Engines"" fail at the theater box office?  Many people including me, enjoyed the film.  Here's my answer.  Mortal Engines came out too late just as this type of youth fantasy sci-fi dystopian genre reached overfill and exhaustion with the general public, especially the young audience who had watched, ""The Hunger Games"", ""Divergent"", and similar movies.  Had Mortal Engines come out in 2016, it would have met with greater box office success.  I read that Peter Jackson began looking at a film theatrical version of the book series.  But it took too long, nine years to bring the film to fruition.  By then the movie-viewing public had tired of the youth dystopian, sci-fi movie genre.  My opinion is that the earlier had ME appeared, the more money it would have made.  A 2016 or earlier release would have probably added at least another 100 million to the mere 83 million box office receipts, probably even breaking the 200 mark.  In that case, the sequel would have appeared in late 2018 and that is when the series would have run into viewer fatigue with the sci-fi genre.",1,0,Grande Artiste,IRsFc2gguEg,0.004761904761904748,2020-04-30 01:05:41,False,False
