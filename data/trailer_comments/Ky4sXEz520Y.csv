How many elderly, harmless ladies were killed because they gave herbs to sick children? How many mathematicians for using Arab numbers?

2018-11-11T16:34:37,One of my favorite movies. Watched it 4 times now and still like it a lot. How it got so many bad reviews is beyond me. I can only assume that haters copied their negative review from each other and everyone else just didn't want to watch a movie with bad ratings. Because tbh I wouldn't have watched it either if it weren't for a friend recommending it to me and watch it with me on blu-ray. Totally underrated this movie.,0,0,SchwarzKater,Ky4sXEz520Y,-0.10312499999999997,2018-11-11 16:34:37,False,False
