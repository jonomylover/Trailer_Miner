And We have the Flying Dutchman back along with Will Turner who seems to be turning into fishpeople, which means he broke the promise of ferrying souls to the next world just like Davy Jones...  Which leads me to think that Ellizabeth died somehow and Turner grew bitter and sad abbandoning his duty, which might be an interesting story line as Henry (Turner) his son might try to fix that. :) And damn that ship of Salazar at 0:27 is epic, really can't wait to see this.  Which I also noticed that the ship come is different stages of decomposition, sometimes it looks like a fine normal ship with white sails and a eagle like print on it like at 0:24 and at 0:34 and other times it looks like a decomposed ghost ship like at 0:27 Also Salazar really reminds me what Beckett and Jones did at the beginning of At Worlds End, exterminate all pirates, but in this case to search for Sparrow. And why the heck is Barbossa still wearing his royal navy outfit, he got his pirate outfit back at the end of On Stranger Tides.... Also really wonder what ship it is at the beginning, it's not the Dying Gull, but the deck is identical to the Black Pearl, only the sails are white...

I always wondered why they never showed the Spanish or Dutch in these movies. Portugese, Spanish, and Dutch all had huge navys and all three were on the ocean just as much as the English. They all had pirates, and privateers too. It would also be cool if they included some French as well.  Does anybody know if any of these nations I mentioned had people representing them in these movies? I mean, They even had asians and asian pirates in one of these movies and as far as I know, Asians didn't have a presence in the Caribbean.",0,0,JCI1990,XibzC-e_s5M,0.037500000000000006,2017-02-06 13:35:47,True,True

The second one was fun to see in theaters with my camp. I'd be lying if I could understand it all but the comedy was great.   I didn't see the third one in theaters. I rented it from Netflix and was disappointed. It was way too long, hard to understand and just not as fun.  Maybe one or two laughs. The only fun part for me was seeing Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's father. He was great.   The fourth one (which I did see in theaters) was worse- although there were parts of it that I liked a little more than the third one. Still- unmemorable.

She's the pirate King! So she lives and rules shipwreck Cove. Maybe the most common clothing you can find among pirates are male clothing.  Maybe Salazar tracks down everyone associated with jack sparrow, therefore contacts the priest from pirates 4, and kidnapped Will Turners daughter: 'Carina Smyth' code name for keeping her hidden.

I love Geoffrey Rush but his character has nothing to do and it would make Salazar actually intimidating unlike Blackbeard, and also give the heroes more reason to kill him. Give him some great lines and stuff to do that is true to his character and have him killed off at an appropriate time. 2) MAKE SALAZAR INTIMIDATING. Unlike EVERY marvel villain who just quips, destroys some cg, gets ass handed to them, and doesn't even die just to keep reappearing in sequels.  3) Return Jacks comedy to that of the first 2 movies. 4) Have Will be a badass which he was only in the 3rd movie.  5) Will could kill Salazar at the end. Jack already killed Barbossa in the 1st, and davy jones in the 3rd using Wills hand.  6) Study 1st two films. Learn from mistakes of Stranger Tides.

The big sacrifice at the end, Will's curse at the end, the wedding scene, how Jack got the compass, none of it made sense! And to make it all worse, the directors thought it'd be hilarious to throw in some cartoon sound effects during the slapstick moments (nearly the whole movie was slapstick). The movie couldn't take itself seriously for one scene, even after the big sacrifice they cut to Jack the Monkey doing something cute. There were some good things, like David Wenham, Salazar, Carina, Barbossa, and Will, but that was really it.
