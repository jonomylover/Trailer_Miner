2015-07-09T10:02:31,This should be a fun and quirky film. It does take a reverse take on the growth of a character. One who is young and in charge to an older gentleman with old fashion but classic ideals but learning from each other. It is not a new idea but does change the dynamics a bit. I would see it. Just the fact that Mr. De Niro is not doing his stereotypical mafia like persona. His character is more refined which i do think Mr. De Niro does play parts of himself in this film. Anne Hathaway has come a long way since the princess diaries. Her character I do think reflects that in the trailer. Should be a nice film to enjoy.
