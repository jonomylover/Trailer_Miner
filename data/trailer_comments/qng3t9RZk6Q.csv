2015-06-20T10:01:00,"Saw this with my girlfriend last night; a touching film, totally different to any previous portrayals of the character we've seen before. Instead of focusing on a grand case like most Holmes stories, it is instead based around three arcs, all told simultaneously, that weave together to tell the tale of Holmes' mission to become more intimate with his humanity, not his mind, while he still has a chance. Classic characters Watson, Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson are only alluded to, with the story instead focusing on Holmes' relationships with Roger, the son of his housekeeper who serves as the catalyst for Holmes' enlightenment; Matsuda, a Japanese official who invites Holmes to Hiroshima with the alleged purpose of helping him to concoct an elixir to salvage his rapidly deteriorating state of mind; and Ann, a woman who serves as the subject of Holmes' final case. Although the plot is almost entirely lacking in suspense - as is the intention, as there is no murder or conspiracy to be found in this story - I found that each of the three stories all drew to a satisfying conclusion. The case storyline - the ending of which is the sole reason for Holmes' retirement - came to a surprising close which tricked my expectations after Holmes had classified the case as ""unsolved"", which turned out to take an entirely different meaning to what I had anticipated. The Japan storyline initially seemed inconsequential but ultimately served as the basis of Holmes' redemption for his last mistake, which has haunted him ever since. And the present-day storyline, although it lacks as much of a genuine resolution as the other two, allows us to see Holmes beginning to understand the side of his being that had always alluded him. The type of film that will take at least two viewings to fully appreciate its majesty, I'd highly recommend it to anyone who loves Sherlock Holmes as a character, instead of just his stories.",1,0,Scrummy64,qng3t9RZk6Q,0.12570512820512822,2015-06-20 10:01:00,True,True
