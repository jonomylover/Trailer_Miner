I'm surprised they didn't add any latin letters, written backwards, in the title, since that's what Americans do in 9 out of 10 movies about Russia. And I like how they are talking about Moscow, a megapolis with the population of over 13 millions, while showing some empty frozen wasteland. Also, the moment on 0:26 is just hilarious. There are several 100 ruble banknotes (100 rubles = $1.7), so, it's no more than $17 in total. If she is supposed to be Russian, then the name ""Dominika"" is hardly an obvious choice, since this name is not in any way Russian. They could have named her Jessica or Dorothy with the same success. Also, any person who has a tiny bit of knowledge about ballet knows that you cannot be a prima ballerina with a body like that.
