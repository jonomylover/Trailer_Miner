2019-01-01T09:35:09,"Welcome to Marwen... The movie was just plain weird. Steve Carrell is great but the directing was garbage. There is a scene that really ticked me off. Mark is in court about to testify about the crimes that have been done to him. It had potential to be a heart wrenching, sad, and emotional scene. Instead, Marks doll character ‚ÄúHogey‚Äù starts fighting nazis and Mark crawls on the ground avoiding the crossfire (bullets). The movie was more about Marks dolls then actually Mark. I feel like i saw more of ‚ÄúHogey‚Äù then Mark himself. Not about overcoming his fears. The movie felt boring, i had no care on what the Marwen characters had to say because THEY ARE NOT REAL. They said based on a true story, they forgot to tell me 2/3‚Äôs of the movie is dolls fighting.  The movie also left plenty of questions unanswered. When Mark is in Wendy‚Äôs house, he notices a photo of a young child. It says something like ‚ÄúWe miss you‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou will forever be in our hearts‚Äù. But We never know what happend to the child and why it is included in the movie. The movie also didn‚Äôt tell us more about the side characters. The women of Marwen are Marks friends. But we never really go deep into who the characters actually are. Next, The movie ends with Mark and his good friend (Roberta) going out to eat some sushi, thats it. Nothing else, do they continue dating, do they end up marrying at one point? Lastly, this is my biggest frustration: In the end of the movie the film does not tell you what happens to the thugs that beat Mark up. Do they get a long sentencing? Do they get life in prison??? You wont know because they wont tell you. This movie is very confusing, making you wonder if it is Marks fantasy or real life. There was no music that moved you, no emotional scenes. Unlike the trailer, the trailer felt moving and had a wonderful soundtrack. Im just truly dissatisfied with this movie.",0,0,Parker Brown,qZGxWSuiiZk,0.0998469387755102,2019-01-01 09:35:09,False,True

Perhaps if someone other than Robert Zemeckis was at the helm of this film, maybe the backlash wouldn't have been so harsh.
