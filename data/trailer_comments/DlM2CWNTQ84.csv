2014-03-20T02:22:16,"@Jamie Heitmann  it's funny that you mentioned character development, when in Raimi's movie, there wasn't any real development at all. Tobey's Spider-Man was the same guy in all 3 movies. It's as if nothing changed about him during the time gaps. Not to mention that horrible montage in the first Spider-Man movie , in which we do not see him develop into Spider-Man as a whole because they wanted to rush it. I saw more development displayed in TASM and it did it in a moderate pace. From becoming a vigilante and only looking for Uncle Ben's killer, to becoming a hero after he saved Jack from the burning car and realizing he can do more and actually help others. I think the new plot is a little too complex for you to understand and see that the Peter of TASM is actually developing gradually. You should really pay attention during movies. I see more of a story here than Raimi's film and it's getting deeper and deeper. And it's funny that what you think will happen, is totally the opposite of it. As I conclude, I suggest you not to cling on to nostalgia in order to form an opinion and further embarrass yourself.

2014-03-20T09:03:08,"""I needed Spidey in my life when I was a kid and he gave me hope. In every comic I read, he was living out my—and every skinny boys'—fantasy of being stronger, of being free of the body I was born into, and that swinging sensation of flight. And upon receiving his power, unlike most who become corrupted, he used it for good. And I think we all wish that we had the courage to stick up for ourselves more, to stick up for our loved one more, or even a stranger you see being mistreated. And Peter Parker has inspired me to feel stronger. He made me, Andrew, braver. He reassured me that by doing the right thing, it's worth it, it's worth the struggle, it's worth the pain, it's worth even the tears, the bruises and the blood. And I wouldn't be able to stand here in front of you guys right now without feeling that Spider-Man was here with me, with his reassuring hand on my shoulder making sure I don't fall over and concuss myself.""  ""He has inspired countless people—girls, boys, men, women, all of us. And he has saved lives, and he saved my life. And I owe Webhead a lot, and I owe 'Stan the Man' a lot.

2014-03-20T09:18:18,"Okay. So Rhino has missiles? So he's completely a power armor/tank? Why didn't they just do the same they did with the Juggernaut in the X-Men movies? That's the REAL Rhino anyway. Electro seems to be black and completely covered in electricity all the time. I first thought he was hydro man or something when I saw the thumbnails. Now I don't mind that Electro is black, but if they had to put a black guy as a major character to ASSURE THE PEOPLE THEY AREN'T RACIST or something they should've chosen someone else, who is actually black. Don't remember any major spiderman villains who are black though... Why they haven't used the Shocker yet is beyond me. I've always liked him for the class B supervillain he is. I mean Shocker would just be so cool as an enemy in a movie. Just doing bankrobberies and blowing up police cars. Hell they could start him off as how he looks in the Spiderman Ultimate series. Just a small time crook who's weapons basically just stun people, but then he could be offered some better technology by Osborn or someone and he'd build the more advanced weapons there. That'd be perfect. Spider-man busts Shocker and then Osborn bails him out and makes him an offer. But yeah... This'll be a cool movie for sure. I just don't like the look of the guy who's supposed to be Harry Osborn and we weren't shown Norman in this at all so... Is Norman Osborn DEAD in this lore? I mean he is and was the original Goblin ALWAYS. If we see Harry again as the Goblin, before even seeing Norman as Goblin I'm gonna have to admit I'm disappointed. Regardless of all this I'm sure I'll like the movie overall, but I KNOW it won't be nearly as good as any of my favourite Amazing Spiderman arcs. Especially something like the Civil War or the recent Spider Island arcs. There's no way this movie can top those. Buuuuuuuuuuuut I can always hope I'm wrong in this case. *EDIT Okay apparently Chris Cooper is Norman Osborn in this... At least he is currently casted as him. Dunno if he's gonna be the Goblin too though or if Harry is still gonna be in that role. What still bothers me is that we were shown only scenes where Goblin doesn't have a mask. I hope they don't just leave the mask out or make the mask really UNgoblin looking.

It is true that no mortal man should recieve that much praise and glory, but at the same time, mankind should not give so much attention and glory to any mortal man. What people do is really up to them and reveals what is in their hearts, it;s their choice. Maybe he could have been Spider-Man? He's got the look, all we would need from him is the charisma, he's played dramatic parts in movies like Titanic, would he be able to have the comedic edge to qualify for the role of Spider-Man? I wonder, all I know is that if he did, he would really be perfect for the role. Only thing is, he just wouldn't need all that attention.

2014-03-21T02:55:09,"I don't know why people on this comment box are saying why there are three villains in this movie. You people amaze me! Rhino, Electro and Green Goblin are in this movie for a reason. Rhino is in it just for 4 - 5 minutes to give comedy in the movie along with Spidey's wisecracks so you don't have to suffer having Spider-Man fighting all of them at the same time like how Sony did it in Spiderman 3. Electro is the MAIN VILLAIN, you people are saying that all three villains are the main villains, but they're not. And Green Goblin/Harry Osborn is the secondary villain who ends up teaming up with Electro to get rid of Spider-Man. These villains are in the movie for a reason. It doesn't matter how many villains you put in a superhero movie, it depends how they fit into the story. The reason Spiderman 3 sucked is because of the bad writing and Avi Arad's stupid ass way to shoehorn Venom into; it wasn't ready to have Venom to begin with, and Topher Grace was a TOTAL miscast.  New Topic: I think Sony is making the movie like The Dark Knight: -Rhino appears for only a couple minutes like how Scarecrow appeared only for three minutes in TDK. -Electro is the main villain like how the Joker is, because Electro wants Spider-Man to burn (no pun intended) like how Joker just wants Batman to break his one rule. -Harry Osborn/Green Goblin is like Two-Face. He wants to rekindle his friendship with Peter like how Bruce and Harvey are trying to trust each other. Then he goes bat-shit crazy when his father dies like how Two-Face did it when Rachel died. -Gwen Stacy is like Rachel Dawes. Gwen is trying to help and support Peter and be a student at Oxford in London. I pretty much think she is going to die almost kind of like how Rachel died (except for the fact that Rachel died while tied to a chair getting burned to death in the hands of the Joker). And when she dies, Peter will find her dead and yells and goes bat-shit crazy on Harry for killing her and nearly killing him during the clock tower fight saying something like ""How dare you kill the one person I love!?"" or something like ""You killed the woman of my dreams! Now you have crossed the line! You are going to die for what you just did! You better think twice before you do something this stupid and idiotic!"" I don't know. That's just me.

As for Rhino and Green Goblin, I like the tech aspects to it's design without heavily going as bad as the first and second Rami goblin designs were and Oscorp has a much heavier presence more so than ever and it should've always been that way. ",3,0,joshua frazier,DlM2CWNTQ84,0.012222222222222226,2014-03-21 15:30:23,True,True

I mean, the Dark Knight had both Joker and Two-Face as the main villains (with Scarecrow in a small role just like Rhino will be) and it worked out just fine.

2014-03-25T02:37:16,Dear people complaining about shotty CGI. Go read up on the uncanny valley effect. The more real something not real looks the more you have to compare it to something that is real. So with all the movement in this movie that is CGI gives your brain a lot to compare to how it would go down if it was real. The CGI is great if you just don't over think it. It would be near impossible for somebody to make 100% unrecognizable CGI.

Spidey is the loudest biggest mouthed super hero around(asides from Deadpool of course). He is constantly throwing clever ass one liners at his enemies right in the middle of a fight, trying to piss them off, which he always does. He shows up out of nowhere when villains are setting a plan, and just surprises them by cracking a joke hanging from a ceiling.  You know that car thief scene in the first movie, where the thief pulls out a knife, spidey goes ""oh no small knives, my only weakness, how did you know"" and he falls to his knees. That right there, is Spider-Man and in the Raimi movies that just wasn't there. Garfield just looks like a smartass. Tobey, although he's an outstanding actor, just didn't have that.

2014-03-27T22:50:02,"Well, I'm thinking this will be a great action-packed, entertaining film edition to the Spiderman legacy. One thing I've always believed however is that Spiderman should have always had his all-black suit, with the dark, charcoal spider on his chest & webbing design spreading throughout in the same deeply dark  grey tone. I know the reason he wore the black suit was to create Venom, but nonetheless, I think Spiderman looks so much more bad-ass & generally just cooler in all black. I mean, it would also have advantages especially at night, camouflage-oriented & such. Also I have seen black spiders... I have not seen a mid-blue & blood-red spider before, so it is even logical for his suit to be black. At any rate, Spiderman's image has been cemented, I know tradition will always keep the good 'ole blue/red spidey-suit. Anyone else agree though? That the black suit was much more ominous, cooler, & simply better looking than that odd colour combination of blue & red???

2014-03-29T08:27:52,there is speculation on if it is venom or other characters in the background shot at 1:34 and as much as i would love to see that cause venom is my all time favorite spider-man nemesis i don't think they would put four villains in this movie or even 3 and have a minor reveal teasing us at the end there would have to be a story to help us see how venom got there so i doubt that is venom swinging probably GG gliding down to fight again,0,1,Purge Praetorian,DlM2CWNTQ84,0.1449074074074074,2014-03-29 08:27:52,True,True

Remember Alistair Smythe is going to be in this movie too, possibly Fisk as well then  Doc Ock, Green Goblin, Rhino, Vulture, Scorpion, __________ ?           Sandman, Mysterio, Shocker, Venom, Kraven the Hunter, Tombstone  in that order for No. 6 ",0,0,Iprofit91,DlM2CWNTQ84,-0.004545454545454544,2014-03-29 11:22:34,True,True

2014-04-02T05:42:00,"Raimi fan boys let's get this straight. The most popular complaint is that The Amazing Spider-man is dark. The amazing spider-man was dark because you all forget Peter suffers from depression. He's a lonely guy all he has are his aunt, uncle, and if you include Harry who treats him as an old best friend but pays little attention to him. After he meets Gwen everything changes. He's not depressed anymore he feels alive and set on living through his uncles words ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Webb nailed the first one with the little details and the backstory on his past. Making me eager to watch how great the second will be. Raimi is a good director I'm not bashing him but he viewed Spider-man as more of an opera if that makes any sense. The biggest mistake was casting Tobey (Yes I said it start unliking this but let's be honest) I speak for many people when I say I never saw him as Spider-man. He was a bland weenie of a character. I never saw that as a 12 yr old boy but seeing the films now they bore the crap out of me. And I just shake my head at every ""joke"" that comes out of Tobey's mouth. To sum it up Raimi didn't make a Spider-man movie but a Raimi movie with Spider-man in it. Boom! I'm more than happy with this reboot. I welcome all the Marc Webb and Andrew Garfield hating ignorant people to write your hateful comments below. I will gladly ignore your ignorance.

2014-04-16T05:17:06,"In a flashback, Richard Parker records a video message in an attempt to explain himself before his disappearance. Along with Mary Parker, he boards a flight that is hijacked by a man sent to kill him. He thwarts the attempt on his life but the pilot loses control of the plane. In the present day, Spider-Man/Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is in pursuit of a criminal carrying a truck full of dangerous chemicals through the city. Whilst talking to Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) on the phone, he sees a vision of her late father, Captain Stacy, and is reminded of the promise he made to stay away from Gwen. During the chase, he saves the life of a man named Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx). Afterwards, Peter meets Gwen at their high school graduation ceremony where the two share a kiss. However, later in the evening, Peter tells Gwen about the visions he's been having and insists that he needs to keep his promise. After years of being away from the city, Harry Osborne (Dane DeHann) returns as the heir to Oscorp Industries and talks with his father, Norman (Chris Cooper), who is in very poor health. Norman explains to Harry that the illness is genetic and that Harry is at the age where it will begin to show. Before he dies, he gives Harry a small device which he claims contains his life's work. The next day, it is reported that Norman Osborne has passed away, making Harry Osborne CEO of Oscorp. Upon hearing the news, Peter Parker visits Harry and the two are revealed to have been childhood friends. Max Dillon, now assuming that he and Spider-Man are best friends, attends work on his birthday as an electrician at Oscorp. Whilst tending to some maintenance, he loses his balance and falls into a tank of electric eels being used for experiments. As a result, he becomes a human mass of electricity. Meanwhile, Peter meets Gwen in attempt to maintain a friendship, and Gwen tells Peter that a job opportunity means she has to move to England. Before the two can discuss it, Max accidentally shuts off the power to Times Square whilst looking for electricity to power himself. Spider-Man attempts to calm the situation down but after the police try to shoot him, Max thinks that Spider-Man has betrayed him and attacks. Spider-Man eventually stops him and he is taken to Oscorp to be tested on. Harry begins to show symptoms of his illness and uses the device his father gave him to deduce that Spider-Man's blood could help save him. He asks Peter for help finding him but Peter refuses, unsure of what effects the transfusion would have. Parker visits Harry again, this time as Spider-Man, but again refuses. Afterwards, Harry is framed by members of the Oscorp board for covering up the accident involving Max Dillon, now known as Electro. and removed from his position as CEO. An employee, Felicia Hardy (Felicity Jones), informs Harry of equipment kept off the books that could help him, and Harry makes a deal with Electro to get him back in to the Oscorp building. Once in, he finds a suit of armour and other equipment made by his father and bio-weapons found by Richard that they called ""symbiotes"". Peter uses information left behind by his father to to locate the video message Richard left. In it, Richard explains that he had to leave New York because he wasn't willing to go along with Norman Osborne's plans to use what they had created for biological weapons. Peter then receives a voicemail message from Gwen, telling him that she was offered the job in England and was heading to the airport to fly there earlier than expected. Peter manages to catch her and professes his love for her, and the two agree to go to England together. They are interrupted by a blackout caused by Electro, who Peter heads off to fight. Gwen eventually follows, against Peter's demands, and the two are able to defeat Electro by overloading his electricity supply. Just after they do so, Harry Osborne arrives, now as the Green Goblin, and tells Spider-Man that he knows his identity and that he wants revenge for being refused the life saving blood transfusion. The two fight at the top of a clock tower, and Spider-Man manages to subdue the Goblin. However, during the fight, Gwen falls and is supported by a web connected to one of the gears. The gears gives way and Gwen again falls, only this time Spider-Man is tragically unable to save her. Months pass and Spider-Man is nowhere to be seen in New York, as Peter spends every day at Gwen's grave. Meanwhile, Harry Osborne is visited by an unknown identity who tells him that they have found a man suitable of operating a large suit of armour developed by Oscorp. The man is Alexsei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) - the criminal stopped by Spider-Man at the start of the film. He attacks the city streets in the suit, going by the name The Rhino. Peter is inspired by a recording of Gwen's graduation speech and makes his return as Spider-Man, confronting The Rhino as citizens watch on.",3,0,Andrew Wiggins,DlM2CWNTQ84,0.026832241832241827,2014-04-16 05:17:06,True,True

On a plus note, Rhino (Paul Giamanti) has signed on for TASM-3 so it's just a tease in this movie. Gwen dies which was obvious as she wears the same clothes in the scene as she does in the #122 comic where she dies.

People are giving it hate because ""it doesn't fit into how it was in the beginning"" yes it was based around Peter Parker working Spider-man into his social life (friends and all that) and it still is about that. People aren't seeing it but he still is trying to fit Spider-man into his social life. Henry for an example (sorry if I spoil it for people I'll try my best not to) he asked Peter for help to get Spider-man but Peter won't let that happen because of Henry's health and safety (there he's looking out for his friend). If you look closely and listen to what's said and the actions that are made, it all goes back to the original plan of Peter Parker fitting Spider-man into his social life.

I can't believe the movie makers decided to do that. Gotta have feminism in the movie I guess, and then they make her an inspiration to peter parker. what in the fuck.   she calls him a cave man, and then breaks all sort of meaning to spiderman and their relationship by making it about her. like him being spiderman as a job is nothing to her, AND the relationship between them is nothing to her. she just ""nobody tells me what to do, NOBODY""  and it's like, what in the fuck? that is the relationship breaker. She essentially came stomping around when peter told her not to come, and this was after a complete mayhem of a fight with electro she comes waddling in and starts barking at pete. and pete totally takes it and turns into a pussy whipped idiot right then and there.  so what now? is she gonna say she doesn't need his help with her job then, is he then gonna say, nobody tells me what to do, nobody? you see how it had nothing to do with a job to do or a relationship? it was completely selfish. so she basically forced her way into it without a care other than she's a female and she does what she wants.  that was incredibly cheap just to throw that in. and it had nothing to do with the relationship. bitch wants to spread her wings, well, she sure definitely got it. glad she's dead.",0,0,Introgauge .C,DlM2CWNTQ84,-0.006632653061224511,2014-04-25 06:27:04,False,True

I like The way they did the 616/ultimate mash up on here, a lot of people complain about the movies but yet, FAILED to read a single Ultimate spider-man comic. I hate the fact that people are still saying ""Oh well I think Tobey is better than Andrew"" thing, Let me  get some info on you guys:   The reason they didn't go with the original electro look is because they used the design for the ultimate spider-man comic book, And it would be impossible to look at electro in that horrible green and yellow ass-tight suit. Very impossible look for the movie. The rhino is based of the same design in the ultimate universe too. Peter Parker met Gwen Stacey way before Mary Jane in the comics (why are so many people complaining about the whole Love interest thing) The goblin Look is based of the 616/ultimate universe look, How? Green goblin in the ultimate universe was transformed in a greenish Monster and he had never had a glider (In the movie the Gobulin m serum transformed his Physical attributes) But, the 616 universe he had the glider and the pumpkin bombs.  The Reason WHY The movie only had The rhino and Goblin in for so Little in the movie because, The movie is revolving around ELECTRO and Not the other villains and they're trying to Introduce the sinister six into the expansion in the TASM movie universe.  In the comics Gwen Stacey is Killed because the green goblin killed gwen stacey by throwing her of the Brooklyn bridge and falls, While spider man web shoots her, The web catches her neck and her neck snaps.  Which causes Gried to peter parker and causes him to be a more mature Spidey in the comics (which alot of people don't understand).  Tobey maguire in the Original Spidey Killed the whole peter Parker vibe, He was a little bit too nerdy. He Always Cried in the movies, he was never energetic and was always mopey and sad. In the TASM movies They're trying to create that peter Parker.

Afterward, Peter meets with Gwen at their high school graduation ceremony, but insists he needs to keep his vow to her father and ends their relationship.  Peter's childhood friend Harry Osborn returns to Manhattan to see his terminally ill father Norman, CEO of OsCorp. Norman explains his illness is hereditary, and Harry is at the age where it first develops. Norman gives Harry a small device he claims contains his life's work. The next day, Norman dies and Harry is appointed the new OsCorp CEO. He alienates the OscCrp board, which has been privy to Norman's secret biogenetic projects for foreign military powers.  Presuming they are now friends, Max becomes obsessed with Spider-Man. While tending to some maintenance in an OsCorp laboratory, he loses his balance and falls into a tank of genetically modified electric eels. They attack him, and he mutates into a living electric generator. Meanwhile, Peter tries to maintain a friendship with Gwen, but she reveals she may move to England for school. Before they can discuss it, Max wanders into Times Square and accidentally causes a blackout. Spider-Man attempts to calm him down, but the police fire at Max, making him lose his temper and attack. Spider-Man eventually stops him, and Max is taken to Ravencroft Institute.  The first symptoms of Harry's illness show, and he uses the device Norman gave him to deduce that Spider-Man's blood could help save him. He asks Peter, who has been selling photos of Spider-Man to The Daily Bugle, for help finding Spider-Man. Peter refuses, unsure of what effects the transfusion would have. The OsCorp board-members frame Harry for covering up Max's accident, and remove him as CEO. Harry's assistant, Felicia, informs him of equipment that could help him, so he makes a deal with Max (now calling himself ""Electro"") to get him back inside the OsCorp building. There he finds a suit of armor and other equipment made by Norman, as well as venom from the now-destroyed genetically altered spiders. Instead of curing him, they transform him into a hideous, goblin-like creature.  Peter uses information left by his father to locate the video message in an abandoned subway station's hidden lab. Richard explains he had to leave because he was unwilling to cooperate with Norman Osborn's biogenetic weaponization plans. Peter then hears a voicemail from Gwen, telling him she was offered the scholarship in England and is heading to the airport earlier than expected. He manages to catch her and professes his love for her, and they agree to go to England together. Electro causes another blackout, and Peter heads off to fight him. Gwen follows, and they kill Electro in an explosion caused by overloading his electricity supply. Afterward, the transformed Harry arrives equipped with Norman's armor and weaponry; upon seeing Gwen, Harry deduces Spider-Man's true identity and, wanting revenge for being refused the blood transfusion, kidnaps her. He fights Spider-Man at the top of a clock tower, and though Spider-Man subdues Harry, he is unable to save Gwen.  Five months later, Peter has given up being Spider-Man and often visits Gwen's grave. Harry is healing from his transformations, and his associate (the ""man in the shadows"" from the first film) breaks Sytsevich out of prison, gives him the code name ""Rhino"" and equips him with an electromechanical suit of armor. Rhino rampages through the streets, and a recording of Gwen's graduation speech inspires Peter to return as Spider-Man and confront him.",0,0,Pretty Flacko,DlM2CWNTQ84,-0.02580808080808082,2014-04-29 04:40:29,False,True

You have to understand they are trying to get away as much as possible from the original trilogy so nobody can compare the two. Tobey Maguire was a little to serious for me and when he tried to be funny it was ehhh, lol i can say alot about the original like the cast looked to old to play them they are suppose to be young teenagers and Gwen is originally Spidermans first girlfriend i did not like how they used her as a side chick in spiderman 3 lol and you cant say spiderman 2 was better it was really good but you just cant compare it because The Amazing Spider Man 3&4 might lead into somethin wayyyyyy better than the last two films than any spiderman movie ever!!! it was great now that the original trilogy is over we can say which was best out of the original trilogy, but Marc Webb did an awesome job adding villains but not bunching them all at once he did a nice separate job and you gotta give it the REAL Goblin hasn't even appeared yet but Harry Osborne looked better as the goblin than Norman in the first original and Harry in the 3rd original without a mask but a disease he looked more like someone actually turning into a goblin. So you can compare them all you want but its not meant to be compared and thats what Marc Webb is going for these 4 films are meant to be its own movie think of it as a different hero basically...we've moved on THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME and they are giving us WHAT WE WANT!!!!

Spoilers below, but in my opinion this is my logic behind the movie, and as to why the writing was horrible, and there was no thought behind the characters except Electro.   Plot was based too much on the romance between Gwen and Peter Parker. Barely any fight scenes, no character development of Harry Osborn or Rhino. The Green Goblin is not supposed to look like a fucking GOBLIN PEOPLE!?!? Harry turned into a Goblin from taking the Spider Venom? how the hell does that make sense?! GREEN GOBLIN IS NOT AN ACTUAL LOOKING GOBLIN....The Green Goblin is a character who has enhanced powers from taking the ""Goblin Formula"", just like Spiderman (with Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe), and he wears a MASK people?!!?!? Also Harry Osborn in this movie was a BIG GIGANTIC BABY, and in my opinion a wimp and gave up his manhood when he screams 'HELP ME! HELP ME! **CRIES** I'M DYING, SAVE ME!!!!"" Then oh, he takes the venom, and finds the glider of the Green Goblin and then all of a sudden magically becomes the Green Goblin?!?! No this was completely stupid, and why the hell does Oscorp own all of the machinery for Doc Oc, Rhino and Eagle...Harry Osborn yet alone Norman Osborn were not mob bosses in the comics, and they did not create those characters. Oh and why all of a sudden Harry's 'GOBLIN' features all of a sudden disappear out of nowhere and he says 'they come and go' and there's no explanation whatsoever about this. They didn't even really explain what kind of hereditary disease him and his father had that was making them die.   The whole story and writing of this movie was complete and utter disappointment, I've never been so let down from a movie. The only thing I give to them is that Electro was good, but there should've been more fight scenes, and CGI was amazing. Other than that, I think the movie budget was completely spent on CGI rather than the writing development and the logic behind the character development. ",1,0,Kristin Ouchi,DlM2CWNTQ84,-0.08922589869281045,2014-05-03 07:36:45,False,True

2014-05-03T19:26:33,"I loved the movie. IDC what any critic says, but being a huge Spiderman I approve of this movie. The character development was great, and by the end of the movie it all payed off because you really get to feel the huge tension between Peter and every other character, specially Gwen if you know what I mean. Moreover, this move is not a Spiderman 3, it really isn't. The villain is clearly Electro; not Goblin or Rhino, which are merely a set up for the Third upcoming movie. Including them did not ruin the villain feel at all. The only thing off is the scenes that really could have been taken out of the movie and make it shorter. Peter's parent's story alone could have been taken out completely and made the movie 30 minutes shorter, the romance between Gwen and Peter should have been implied and a continuation since it was established in the first movie rather than spending a lot of time on the two alone (felt like a chick flick at a point actually lol), and that air planes scene (if you watched it you'll understand"" was just to add a feel in the movie that was already there (Electro's fight alone was fantastic). In fact, the time used on these sub plot lines could have been used to show us more of Electro, which felt underdone.

The incredible on screen chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is still there. Andrew Garfield did another great job along with Emma. To my surprise, Jamie Foxx did an amazing job. Dane Dehaan was unforgettable. He was creepy and charismatic at the same time and really handled the character's arc very well. The CGI looked fine to me. There WAS enough fight scenes also. Don't listen to anyone who tells you different, they're probably 9 years old and have an awful attention span. The movie isn't rushed at all, it's 2 hours and 30 minutes long and will keep you interested the entire time. I will say the rhino was a little cheesy but the ending really was awesome. Hanz Zimmer did a great job on the soundtrack.   When I say don't listen to anyone who says this movie is bad I'm serious. Go see the movie and get your own opinion on it.

Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Dane Dehaan were great. Jamie Foxx, Sally Field and Colm Feore were decent. Chris Cooper and Felicity Jones were wasted.  Paul Giamatti is a great actor, but the Rhino was way too over-the-top and cartoonish. It made me cringe so much and he's far too good an actor to play such a ridiculous character.

Peter is kind of a confusing character because Andrew acts him as very shy and awkward but then he comes out with one liners and snarky comments. That could work if he had different personalities when Peter and as Spider-Man but it isn't done that way.  He's just not a believable nerdy awkward guy because he so easily switches to being cool and confident, and because of how attractive he is and the way he dresses and stuff. I definitely like Gwen more than Mary Jane because she doesn't seem like a totally useless ""damsel in distress"" type, but something about this new triology just doesn't work for me, and I love superhero films and have loved most of the ones from the past 10 years.

According to the director Marc Webb, they cut her out because they believed it wasn't the right time for her introduction. Is he serious? It was the appropriate time to introduce her character. I've seen the set pictures so it should have been like this. Peter broke up with Gwen so he should've met MJ some where in the beginning at the front porch of his house and met up with her again out back at peter's garage and the end scene when she was working in a cafe, the Rhino knock a car on top of a taxi out outside the store. She supposed to walk out and see Spidey swing into action vs the Rhino. She should've been the one to comfort him as a friend in support at the end also. I think they got scared that the hardcore fans will boycott their movies and back out because of the backlash about shailene woodley portraying MJ. I also have a feeling they are thinking about re-casting the part. For me I love Shailene and I would be sadden if they do. I see her as the fun loving girl next door MJ from Ultimate Spider-man comics but not the super model MJ from the ASM comics that everyone wanted.

I think it would have been so much more effective if they would have had more buildup on Peters and Harry's friendship. In short, it was a really good movie.

I feel like they did everything right and did everything right as far as handling villains go. They didn't overdo anything and led on to the next Spider-Man. I'm really hoping we see Doctor Octopus and Vulture in the 3rd one along with maybe another cameo from Rhino. So that it leads up to a Sinister Six team up in the 4th film. I also feel like in the 3rd movie they should go with the route of having Peter doubting his Spider-Man side. Not saying he should go emo or anything but he should give up for a little bit only to comeback and kick major ass.

Before I watched it I have read some forum saying there were too many things going on, or too many villains, so I expected it all already so for me its all ok. Its not confusing. And about Harry, its understandable there wasnt enough time for their friendship scenes, the movie doesnt have to repeat everything again what we already saw in the past Spiderman franchise. It is boring if every detail has to be explained. When you watch this movie just use your logic and be understandable. Dont complain too much like you know how to direct a movie or write scripts. Compared to other heavy graphics movies, this movie was much much better. Definitely one of my favorite superhero movies of all time, just second or third to The Dark Knight.

Once by myself and another with a girl who hadn't seen it last night.  On a scale of 1-10 I'll give the movie a 7 or 7.5.  Movie was good...but not that damn good. The movie wasn't good as Captain America: The Winter Soldier and I highly doubt it's going to be as good as Days of Future Past. To me the movie is probably on par with Man of Steel as far as ratings. Nah, not quite. I give Man of Steel an 8 out of 10. Def better than Iron Man 2 and Thor 2 (which was about a 6-6.5 out of 10).  This by far is the best Spider-Man movie to date. It even had a pretty good soundtrack too. And despite what people are saying, I actually liked the movie laid the ground work for future Villains...esp the Goblin.  However, I did think that some of the parts were a little cheesy...especially Electro's background.  I also thought Rhino was extra cheesy.  Im actually looking forward to The Amazing Spiderman 3.  And one more note...I thought it was a nice marketing strategy by Sony to brand everything Parker utilized.  I may want to check out Sony's line of cameras when I purchase my next DSLR, but I'll probably go with Canon. lol ",0,0,canibus19,DlM2CWNTQ84,0.29468749999999994,2014-05-19 06:34:46,False,True

2014-11-17T00:04:24,"How ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" could Have Been Better. By slimybug  We come to it at last. It is my personal conclusion that this film would have been inexorably improved if the filmmakers had done two things very differently.      1- Make Norman Osborn the main villain.      2- Give less development on Electro.                 Imagine if the film had gone this way: Norman Osborn, not Harry, continues to search for a cure for his illness. This time,  it leads to the creation of Electro, a fairly simple, hired thug (which is what Max Dillon is in the comics anyway), whom Norman Osborne will use to do his bidding.                 This immediately solves the problem of not having a central antagonist. It is Norman. Even if Electro gets to fight Spider-Man first, even if Norman doesn’t become the Green Goblin until the end of the film, his is the evil hand that is making everything move. It also removes the random character story given to Electro, and just makes him merely a henchmen, like so many other film henchmen, to be fought and disposed of before the real villain.                 Much of Harry's story could actually remain much the same. What if Norman’s explaining of his illness, of the real reason he has been absent for so much of Harry’s life, to save both of them, effects Harry, and despite his previous hatred of his father, he now wants to save him? He would still be despearate for hielp,  appeal to Spider-Man, much like he does in the film.                  This change in plotline would actually give a great way for the revelation about Peter’s parents, although unchanged, to actually play a part in the greater story of the film. Perhaps Peter actually does decide to give Harry’s father his blood. But right around that time is when he discovers his father’s message. Here is when he realizes how evil Norman really is, and what he will use the research for. And so he returns to Harry, as Spider-Man, and refuses, leading to a similar scene.                 Finally, Norman can wait no longer, and uses the serum on himself. Spider-Man defeats his henchemen Electro, but then has to fight the Green Goblin, much as seen in the film. After killing Gwen, the Goblin, in this scenario, would get away.  In the end, Peter would still has no idea who the Green Goblin is, just that there is a new villain out there, and more to come. The film would still end much the same way, only with new villains being created, and an Osborne the mastermind behind it all.  In terms of the Goblin's arc, it almost seems this would have been the natural plotline the filmmakers would have thought of first. The purpose of Norman's presence in the first film seems to be to tease his eventual rise as the Goblin, and it makes sense for him to do so in the second chapter, in which Gwen Stacey would be killed. Replacing him with Harry seems to be a secondary decision. The above summary might actually be a somwhat accurate description of the film we would have, if the filmmakers were not so afraid of retreading the past.  It is my opinion that, with these things changed, we would have a better, stronger film. http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/slimybug/news/?a=101797",1,0,Estivel Garcia,DlM2CWNTQ84,0.03563404985818779,2014-11-17 00:04:24,False,False

2015-06-19T11:43:12,"The Amazing-Spiderman 2 is probably the most underrated Spideymovie and doesn't deserve all the shit it's getting. Sure it has its ups and downs, but it's in my opinion a good movie.  Andrew Garfield did an amazing job as a realistic and witty Peter Parker and I wouldn't have changed him for anything. I think he portrayed a 19 year old with parents issues and loneliness perfectly and he really gave me a New-York feeling with his voice and acting. Andrew portrayed a more witty and wise cracking Spider-Man, which I missed in the Raimi-movies.  Emma Stone, as Gwen Stacy, did a fantastic job as well and the chemistry between Andrew and her was incredible. You could really see how much they liked eachother on screen. The dialogues felt real and not forced. One of the best romances I've seen, at least in superhero-movies.  Over to Jamie Fox as Max Dillon or Electro. This one was one of my favorite characters. It was a fresh breeze to see the celebrity star Jamie Fox take on this geeky and sad character, when he's usually so macho and cool in most movies.  So many scenes with Max Dillon made me laugh, but I also felt bad for him, because he was such a seemingly good person and everyone treated him like a ghost. He just wanted to be seen and I as a viewer could feel that.  Dane DeHaan, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, played the role of Harry Osborn, a boy with extreme daddy issues and a seemingly uncureable illness and boy does Dane DeHaan deliver. During the whole movie you can see that Harry Osborn is full of anxiety and stress and it is built up perfectly for the end when he becomes the Green Goblin. I just loved this character. Dane DeHaan is very skilled with dark and disturbing characters and I hope to see more of him!   I personally loved the music in this movie. It was a big step up from TASM 1. Let's just say that Hans Zimmer can do no wrong! The Magnificent Six did a great job composing. + All the other artists that appeared in this film.  Now, where did this movie fall?  Too much and too unbalanced is something I've heard from many people and something I agree with partially. The film has so many plot lines, it sort of overwhelms you and it has one too many villains. This movie's original ending was supposed to be dark, but money horny Sony, changed the ending into a more happy ending with yet another unnecessary villain. From what I heard Sony changed ALOT of things with the original script and cut, which probably ruined the movie in many aspects.  I really do blame Sony for this movie's lack of succes. If they'd let Marc Webb do his thing, this movie would probably been more original and a lot less of a mess.  In all it's ups and downs I still think this is a good movie and I really enjoyed it. It's a shame there wont be a The Amazing Spider-Man 3, since this movie pretty much built up plenty for a third film.",28,0,Gustav Vesterlund,DlM2CWNTQ84,0.3145,2015-06-19 11:43:12,False,False

The idea of Peter trying to find out his parents was actually pretty interesting. I also thought Andrew Garfield was a great Spider-Man.   Then I saw TASM2. I hated it. Overstuffed just like SM3. But worse. Terrible pacing. And none of the side plots clicked or were really developed. The only one that did get a lot of development was the romance thing.   Overall I'm happy that Spider-Man is coming to the MCU, and very hyped for his debut in Civil War and the upcoming solo Spider-Man movie. (However I'm not to crazy with the logo or name....) But I do think they should've at least concluded the series before starting up another solo film. Maybe have him appealed in Civil War and then like a 3rd and final movie for TASM or a TV series continuation (surely would be better than Ultimate Spider-Man :P)",0,0,I Can't Think of a Good Name,DlM2CWNTQ84,0.126,2016-04-14 22:48:17,False,False

This film series made an effort to make the visuals pop, whether it was the lights popping at night as Spider-Man swung on cranes in the first one, or the electric lights at the power plant in this one, it was always made to be very visually pleasing overall. The more bland aesthetic of the MCU Spider-Man fits in with the rest of the earthbound films of the series, but even so, I'll miss the visuals of this one. I think they're due to Marc Webb being a music video director prior to making movies, they tend to have standout visuals.",0,0,Tornado Chaser,DlM2CWNTQ84,0.10916666666666666,2018-01-19 17:35:30,False,False

Let’s be honest, the only reason they, as well as other viewers disliked the movie is because Gwen died, and reality is they hated it because it is Emma Stone who stars as Gwen. And many people wanna sleep with Emma Stone, so they wrote bad reviews in retaliation to them for killing off Gwen. Additionally, they completely ignored the most important thing about sequels (generally the 2nd film): they almost never come close to, or even come close to the original.

2020-01-14T06:02:27,"Emma Stone personally wrote Gwen's graduation speech.  When Spider-Man swings and maneuvers through a dark alley, a brief shot of a yellow pair of pants with a red stripe on them can be seen hanging from a clothesline. This is the costume of comic book villain Shocker.  Filmed entirely in New York State, making it the largest movie to ever be filmed in the state  According to the actors, the original Green Goblin vs. Spider-Man fight was longer and more violent, but had to be cut in order to keep the PG-13 rating. Things that were cut include a scene where the Goblin is conscious when Gwen dies and laughs at Peter as he cries over Gwen's body, then Peter almost beats the Goblin to death after Gwen is killed.  Jamie Foxx is the first African-American to play a villain in the Spider-Man films  At 142 minutes, this is longer than any previous Spider-Man film.  The theme from Spider-Man (1967) is played repeatedly as Peter's cell phone ringtone, and Spider-Man also whistles the theme when stripping Aleksei Systevich.  Jamie Foxx wore 21 thin silicone facial prosthetics, which works better than foam when it comes to mimicking skin.  at around 24 mins) Early on in the film, Max Dillon has a birthday cake in his fridge that is white with green icing and yellow lightning bolts. This is a homage to the original Electro suit from the comics.  While filming Peter and Gwen's first reunion after their break up, Andrew Garfield's heel was run over by a taxi.  This is the first ""Spider-Man"" film to be filmed entirely in New York [State] and the largest film production ever in New York City.

I have to praise the movie for executing all the action scenes in a wonderful manner, near flawless CGI, satisfying combat and slow mo scenes and obviously godly music. The swinging scenes were also so damn good, satisfying to watch too. Character relationships and dialogue were well done, specially Gwen and Peter.
