In this movie, the men are doing it by choice. They are in a event, by choice. We are allowed to enjoy both these scenarios. If this movie had men being shown as objects without their choice, trust me there would be a hue and cry. And for all the rude comments by the men about feminists, your kind, not all of you, but your kind have been doing it for centuries. And we get one movie about men, you go apeshit. Secondly, for all the men, if you are getting offended, please see the whole perspective and then judge. That will show you the difference between feminists and feminazis. And us feminists support men just as much as women. You are loved and respected too. Please don't make an issue out of nothing. When burlesque came out, women didn't go crazy, they enjoyed it. This has come out, in good spirits, let us enjoy it. Everything doesn't have to be tit for tat. And if it does, atleast think three times before making a statement saying feminists are fake.
