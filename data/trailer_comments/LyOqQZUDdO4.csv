2018-02-07T21:02:14,"Awesome!!!¬† A huge part of Paul's ministry was the Gospel.¬† Paul was a ""tentmaker"".¬† When we respond to the Gospel,¬†God's Holy Spirit comes into our tent, our body.¬† A super awesome way to present the full Gospel is found in Leviticus 23, what???¬† yes, Leviticus.¬† In that chapter we find the 7 Feasts/Holy Convocations.¬† Most everyone has heard of Passover, but there are actually 6 more.¬† The 7 together are a beautiful outline in presenting the whole Truth and nothing but the Truth.¬† Here is the Gospel:¬†¬†the Messiah was Born¬†at Trumpets, which has been a two day Feast/Holy Convocation since 500 B.C.¬† What would of terrified tough guy shepherds? a lion, or bear, or wolves, no, but thousands and thousands of angels blowing Trumpets announcing the Birth of the New Born King would have.¬† The Hebrew New Year's Day,¬†began at¬†the start of the 7th Month called Tishri.¬† Tishri means Beginning.¬† Trumpets is the only Feast/Holy Convocation that uses Ram's Horns (Shofar) all the rest use silver trumpets.¬† Also note that the Dorset Ram is¬†born in the spring and fall.¬† And the shofar are from this ram.¬† (Note the Genesis 22, ""Ram with His Head caught in a Crown of Thorns"" at Moriah.)¬† Then eight days later the Messiah was Circumcised on the¬†Day of Atonement, fulfilling the Circumcision Covenant given to Abraham, ""thorough the loins of Abraham all nations will be blessed."" Millions and millions of people have been circumcised souly to point to the coming Christ.¬† In the Book of Acts, we read that¬†circumcision is no longer required, but now optional, why?¬† Because the Messiah fulfilled it.¬† Notice that the entire New Testament opens up with the genealogy from Abraham to the Christ in Matthew 1.¬† We¬†then have Tabernacles, God with us, Emmanuel, the Messiah Tabernacling/Dwelling amongst us (John 1)¬†for 33 without sin years, without leaven.¬† People¬†totally missed the point that the fall Feasts/Holy Convocations were for sin.¬† The spring Feasts/Holy Convocations were for death.¬† The Christ conquered sin and death.¬†Notice one week prior to the Crucifixion that people put Tabernacle/Sukkot/Palm branches on the ground for the Messiah to ride over on a ""beast of burden"" that no one had ever ridden or can ever ride.¬† He alone took our burden of sin.¬† Then we have the Crucifixion, and oddly enough it¬†was¬†Friday the 13th.¬† Because we are on a Hebrew¬†Lunar Calendar, and every Sabbath was the 7th Day, and was a Saturday, and¬†the Passover was Saturday, Nisan 14.¬† His Body was taken down prior to that evening.¬† Hebrews go from evening to morning for one day, exactly like Genesis 1.¬† The Christ was our Passover Lamb.¬†He was in the Tomb for Saturday, Sunday and Monday (as Jonah in Matthew 12:40), for half of the Unleavened Bread Week, He Rose of First Fruits Tuesday.¬† Tuesday is also the Third Day of the week, Sunday 1, Monday 2 and Tuesday the Third Day.¬† The Word of God also expresses His Resurrection Day as ""the first day of the week"".¬† If you do not know the Feasts/Holy Convocations from Leviticus 23, you won't get this one.¬† The Christ Rose of the first day¬†of the week of week one of the 7 Weeks of 7, or 49 Days of Weeks, First Fruits is Day 1 of the 49.¬† Something also very awesome is that God ""saw it was good"" twice on the Third Day of creation (Genesis 1:9-13).¬† Some Orthodox Jews get married on Tuesday because God saw it was good twice on the third day.¬† Interesting as well is that the very first Miracle of the Messiah was at a wedding on the third day, in John 2.¬† During the 49 Days of Weeks, the Christ appeared to many, even 500 at one time, proving that He not only conquered sin but sin and death,¬†which is the Gospel.¬† Then on Day 50, Pentecost, He gave us His Holy Spirit, we are now¬†the temple of the Holy Spirit.¬†¬†A huge point that has been overlooked is that the Only Day a¬†year that sin can be atoned for is on the Day of Atonement.¬†¬†In the Torah, this is the Only Way.¬† The talmud has another way, pray ask for forgiveness.... on the Day of Atonement and you are good.¬† But the Torah does not say that.¬† In the Torah, the High Priest goes¬†into the Temple, Behind the Veil, into the Holy of Holies, before the Ark of the Covenant and¬†makes atonement for the people year after year after year.¬† This was the Only Way.¬† Today there is not Temple, no Veil, No Holy of Holies, no Ark of the Covenant, no way to atone for sin per the Torah.¬†Today people teach that the Messiah has yet to fulfill this, what?¬† They are in essence teaching that He has yet to¬†Atone for sin.¬†¬†The Christ was the Last and Great and Final High Priest of the Temple system. One Sacrifice, Once for all (Hebrew 10:10).¬† He,¬†the Manna from Heaven (Exodus 16, twice as much given on the 6th day), the Bread of Life (John 6), even being Born in¬†Bethlehem (House of Bread)¬†was Crucified on the 6th day so the people of God could have Eternal 7th Day Sabbath Rest.¬† His 7 Feast/Holy Convocation Work equals our Eternal Sabbath Rest.¬† His Work=our Rest.",4,2,Keith Elrod,LyOqQZUDdO4,0.2294090023037391,2018-02-07 21:02:14,True,True

But then realized he wasn't playing Christ. But the problem with the Passion was that, firstly they showed a man portraying Christ, which is a sin and that they focused on the temporal sufferings of Christ, which is not what he feared. Going to the cross is something future Christians joyed in but Christ sweated blood from the fear that his cross would bring and that was the righteous judgement of God poured out on him for the sins of all the elect. So when watching this film, I have not seen Passion, we need to be dubious. Be like the Berean, study this movies message by the light of scripture to see if they are so. I hope so, I truly hope in this overly Liberal abortion loving world that we see a true Gospel centred powerful movie that can change peoples hearts toward God, otherwise it is just for entertainment purposes, which I've no problem with entirely but I'd like something more meaningful at this opportunity.",3,5,Darren Murphy,LyOqQZUDdO4,0.196875,2018-02-10 14:25:27,True,True

Not a single instance in any of Paul's writings claims that he ever meets or sees an earthly Jesus, nor does Paul give any reference to Jesus' life on earth (except for a few well-known interpolations). Therefore, all accounts about a Jesus could only have come from other believers or his imagination if he actually existed. He never actually saw Jesus; he experienced a vision of the resurrected Jesus.  Every leading Christian scholar since Erasmus, five hundred years ago, has maintained that the gospels were originally written in Greek from 70 to 140 CE (Mark after the year 70, Luke about 110, Matthew about 130, and John no earlier than 140 CE). This proves that they were not written by Christ's apostles, disciples or by any of the early Christians.  Most scholars agree that the bible characters of Jesus and his Aramaic speaking disciples/apostles, would have been mostly illiterate and couldn't have written the new testament bible, because it was written completely in Greek and their life expectancies would have made it impossible.

There are the seven spirits of God in the heart of a true Christian, child of God. A true child of God does not worship power: Zech. 4:6. All Christians are trying to worship both the holy spirit and the spirit of power: you cannot worship God and Mammon (money is power). How can we become true children of God? It helps if you get a career that comes from a talent bestowed by parents. Matthew says one must humble oneself: pride comes by the worship of power. Isaiah 66:17 lists the four ways the sinner worships power: Idol: a group that worships a man or thing to bestow power, emotional colour gold, number 9; Mouse: clever words or small-precise actions that glamorize power, yellow, 8; Swine: lust, green, 6; Abomination or Might: a dark slow heavy spirit that is the accumulation of facts or actions to make a strong argument or immoveable fortress, black, 2.If you compare yourself to Gays and Tyrants and thank God you are not like them, you are still a sinner.

Prepare yourself in the coming days, that you may stand unshakeable in the sight of our Lord and your oppressors. Hate them not, fight them not, but forgive them as Christ begged for the forgiveness of those who crucified him.

They should have said, ""Why God? Why kill a good man like this?"". It may seem to shatter their hopes. They should have shown how they rely on the letters of Paul to live their lives. They should have shown how they encourage one another despite the hardships in life. The suffering and pain of Christians can connect with people. Then there should be total darkness and light.

It was inspiring to see the struggle and the loss of life for the Word of God, that spreading the Truth is worth everything. We take for granted, most of us, that we are able to express our faith without fear of punishment or even death. I believe that for most of us as Christians, Paul represents how we would want to express our faith in this world. Uncompromising and with conviction and he did, according to Scriptures ""persuade"" many people to follow Christ.   I do have to say that it did seem  like heresy when Luke is talking to Paul about what he should and shouldn't include in the bible. Scripture tells us that the bible was breathed out by God.   "" All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,""  2 Timothy 3:16 (NIV)   I can't imagine how difficult it is to make a movie about a subject that millions think they are the expert on and then have to sit back while people dismantle what you did wrong with it. (finger pointing at myself) At the same time I think it is important for us to view the film with open eyes and to not be mislead by the unavoidable inconsistencies that happen.

Meanwhile the movie is ... yeah, disappointing. Faulkner's acting is really poor.Caviezel's is a bit better, but still the best role is Mauritius (Olivier Martinez), who is the most bold and interesting character there. I'm not sure what was the idea for this movie, but the plot is really, really chaotic. We see old, depressed and emotionless Paul, who doesn't remind us Paul from the Book of Acts or the Letters. We see murdered and persecuted Christians, who have no clue what to do.Some of them lost their faith. I mean... it's a really pessimistic movie for some reason. (And yes, I know those times were awful).  If someone never read the Bible , there's no chance for that person to figure out what the film is all about. Where is the huuuge part of supernatural interventions? Where are his gifts of the Spirit? Where are the miracles? Where is all the amazing heroism of this saint? Why his conversion on the road to Damascus looks more like a heat stroke hallucination?  The life of Paul is a ready made scenario for a great action movie. His life was very dynamic, full of God's signs, it was extraoridinary. No trace of this life in the movie. And ...that's a pity. Everything revolves around death in this movie.

2019-03-18T09:31:37,"Bible Verses That Indicate Jesus Is Not God The Creator  1. Matthew 24:36  No one knows about that day or hour, not even the Son, but the Father only.  Here Jesus makes a distinction between what he knows and what the Father knows.   2. Matthew 26:39  My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me, yet not as I will, but as Thou will.  Jesus‚Äô will is likewise autonomous from God‚Äôs Will. Jesus is seeking acquiescence to God‚Äôs will.  3. John 5:26  For as the Father has life in Himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.  Jesus received his life from God. God received his life from no one. He is eternally self-existent.   4. John 5:30  By myself, I can do nothing: I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who has sent me.  Jesus says, ‚Äúby myself, I can do nothing.‚Äù This indicates that Jesus is relying upon his own relationship with God. He is not trying to ‚Äúplease myself‚Äù but rather is seeking to ‚Äúplease the one who sent me.‚Äù  5. John 5:19  The Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees the Father doing, because whatever the Father does, the Son does also.  Jesus declares that he is following a pattern laid down by God. He is expressing obedience to God.  6. Mark 10:18  Why do you call me good? No one is good, except God alone.  Here Jesus emphatically makes a distinction between himself and God.  7. John 14:28  The Father is greater than I.  This is another strong statement that makes a distinction between Jesus and God.  8. Matthew 6:9  Our Father, which art in Heaven.  He didn‚Äôt pray, Our Father, which art standing right here!‚Äù  9. Matthew 27:46  My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?  Inconceivable if he is God the Creator.  10. John 17:21-23  . . .that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. . ..that they may be one as we are one: I in them and you in me.  In this prayer Jesus defines the term ‚Äúto be one.‚Äù It is clearly accomplished through the relationship of two autonomous beings. Christian believers are to model their relationship (to become one) after the relationship of God and Christ (as God and Christ are one). Notice that ‚Äúto be one‚Äù does not mean to be ‚Äúone and the same.‚Äù  11. 1 Corinthians 15:27-28  For he ""has put everything under his feet."" Now when it says that ""everything"" has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.  Paul declares that God put everything under Christ, except God himself. Instead God rules all things through Christ. (remember: ‚Äúthrough him all things were made.‚Äù)  12. Hebrews 1:3  The Son is the radiance of God‚Äôs glory and the exact representation of his being.  Jesus is the exact representation of his being. I send my representative to Congress. He is not me, myself. He is my representative.  13. Hebrews 4:15 (compared with James 1:13)  For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are‚Äîyet without sin.  Jesus has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet he never sinned. See   James 1:13: When tempted, no one should say, God is tempting me. For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt.  Jesus was tempted in every way, but God cannot be tempted. This is why Jesus said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt call me good, none are good, only God.‚Äù  14. Hebrews 5:7-9  During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him  Jesus had to walk a course of faith and obedience in order to achieve perfection. By achieving perfection, Jesus ‚Äúbecame‚Äù the source of eternal salvation",0,1,mohd suhail,LyOqQZUDdO4,0.19615013227513228,2019-03-18 09:31:37,False,False

Paul was Satan in the Flesh  Paul was never recognized as an apostle by the Disciples OR Jesus  Paul was never trained by the disciples, the men who walked, talked, and broke bread with our Saviour. He received his knowledge from ""revelations.""  Paul's account of his Damascus Road Experience changed every time he told it, thus the disciples knew he was lying.  Paul declared he was teaching another Gospel of which he himself was the Father  Paul declared  he himself was the son of God  Paul issued his own commandments and laws for people to adhere to  Paul taught the exact Opposite of what Jesus and His real disciples did.  Paul worked to destroy and undo everything Jesus and His disciples did and were doing.  Paul was never repentant for being the greatest persecutor of Christians at that time! He boasted about it! Over and Over!  Paul said God's law was a Curse. Jesus said it was a blessing. Who's lying?  Paul condemned Jesus and His disciples for false teachings, he condemned Jesus Himself for having long hair in 1 Corinthians 11:14,  something approved in Numbers 6:5 and Judges 13:5.  Jesus Said: Keep the Sabbath (Mark 2:27), circumcise male children (Luke 2:21), Paul Said: Circumcision is not necessary (Romans 2:26) that is going against what the Christ said in Luke 2:21.  In 1 Corinthians 15:1 Paul says that he was not giving them anything but what ‚Äúhe preached.‚Äù He explained this even further in the second book (or letter) to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11:17). It reads - ‚ÄúThat which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.‚Äù He's telling you plain and simple he was speaking of himself and not from or of the Lord!""

2019-04-05T04:57:50,"Paul's hypocrisy is astounding once you open your eyes to it. He says that to get circumcised makes void the Cross of Christ, yet he kowtows and has Timothy circumcised.  Paul says the Law is a BURDEN. (ACTS 15:10 and throughout Paul's writings)  Paul says the Law is a CURSE (GALATIANS 3:10) Christ said his yoke was light. (MATTHEW 11:30)  Paul says that the Messiah is the end of the law (ROMANS 3:28; 10:4)  Christ said he came NOT to change the Law, a ""jot or tittle"". (MAT 5:18; LUKE 16:17)  Paul says he is convinced there is ""no unclean thing"" (ROMANS 14:14) Christ HATES the doctrine of Balaam, which teaches acceptance of the unclean. (REV 2:2)  Paul says, ""be ye followers of me"" (1 COR 4:16) Christ says we are to follow HIM (LUKE 9:59).  Paul testified of himself and a ""special revelation"" (GALATIANS 1:12) Christ testified NOT of HIMSELF (JOHN 5:30-31)  Paul said those who are justified by the law, are fallen from grace (GALATIANS 5:4) Paul said that the Law was ""the death of him"" (ROMANS 7:9-10) Christ said ""to enter into life, keep the commandments"" (MATTHEW 19:17) Christ said ""if you love me, keep my commandments"" (JOHN 14:15)  Paul, collectively, speaks of himself -- ""I, PAUL,"" -- and uses the personal pronoun ""I"" more than the name of Jesus. Interestingly, the Greek word for ""I"" is EGO. Christ said: He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. (JOHN 7:18)  Christ came in His Father's name, and as seen throughout Paul's writings, Paul clearly came in his own name. ""if another come in his own name, he you will receive"" (JOHN 5:43).  Paul admits to being a pharisee (ACTS 26:5, PHILLIPIANS 3:5) Christ says beware of the leaven of the pharisees (MATTHEW 16:6)  Paul says he is CONVINCED that unclean meats are okay, and that  circumcision is not necessary. (COL 2:16; ROMANS CHAPTER 2-4) Christ said whoever teaches against the law is the least in heaven. (MATTHEW 5:19)  Paul says ""Christ is the end of the Law"" (ROMANS 10:4) Christ said he came NOT TO DESTROY the LAW. (MATTHEW 5:17)  Paul says he is a ""father"" of Christ's churches. (1 COR 4:15; PHILEMON 1:10) Christ said CALL NO MAN FATHER, but He who is in heaven. (MATTHEW 23:9)  Paul says there is a structure to Christ's church, containing apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors/shepherds, and teachers. (EPHESIANS 4:11) Christ said there is ONE FLOCK, and ONE SHEPHERD (JOHN 10:16)",1,1,edbtzkhud,LyOqQZUDdO4,0.26224489795918365,2019-04-05 04:57:50,False,False

2019-11-30T22:10:29,"JESUS IS COMING SOON!!!   There is no Heaven or ‚Äò‚Äôafterlife‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äôparadise‚Äô‚Äô for those who do NOT put their FAITH in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sins. Faith is BELIEVING that Jesus, who is the son of GOD, who lived a sinless and perfect life, DIED on the cross about 2000 years ago as a blood sacrifice (or sacrificial lamb) for all the sins you have committed and should be punished for according to the law of GOD which has been violated by every single person ever in existence, except for Jesus.   Sin is simply breaking GOD‚Äôs law. The punishment of breaking the law of GOD is Hell. Everyone is guilty before the Judge, and the judge is GOD.     *** You are not a good person in a lawful perspective. In this life, If you have murdered someone, it does not matter if you save the world 3 times, or feed 5 million homeless people for the rest of their life, or donate 25 billion to charity, you STILL have broken the law and will have to answer for that crime in front of a Judge, and receive your punishment/penalty. The point here is: NO amount of Good deeds can cover the fact that you have broken the law. So with God it is not a weighing of the scales process of good and bad deeds in your life. It means that one time breaking the law means eternal punishment which is hell, and no amount of good deeds can cover that. ***     The way, and entrance, to heaven is only accomplished or granted when you put your Faith (believing in) in the fact that Jesus took your penalty for breaking the law upon him when he died on the cross.    The image here is: Jesus walks in the courtroom and says to GOD the Judge, who is in the process of Judging you, that he will take YOUR penalty for sinning/breaking GOD‚Äôs law, which is eternal punishment, upon HIM. Only this punishment, which was dying on the cross 2000 years ago, was a one time sacrifice, once and for all, for everyone who sincerely believes that Jesus did that for them, and therefore accept his sacrifice.   WHAT DO YOU DO NOW?   Step1: recognize and admit you are a sinner, a lawbreaker. And that you need a savior who saves you from hell.   Step2: accept Jesus Christ as your savior, and make him LORD of your life.   Step3: Confess your sins to GOD, confess with you mouth that Jesus is Lord, and Repent of your sins, which means to turn completely away from all sin and TURN TO GOD. break with sin, break with your life, break with living for yourself and your own pleasures, break with the things of this world, give the lordship of your life over to Jesus (now you are still your own Lord, and you must make Jesus Lord ) and obey the will and commandments of Jesus instead of your own will and commandments.    Step 4: ask Jesus + GOD the father + the Holy Spirit into you hart and surrender to them.   Step 5: START READING THE BIBLE EVERYDAY AND DO NOT STOP.   Jesus said: I AM the way, and the truth, and the life. Jesus said: Deny yourself, pick up your cross and follow me. Jesus said: no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Paul said: For it is by grace¬†you have been saved,¬†through faith. and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God. not by works,¬†so that no one can boast.   Matthew 28:18-20 New International Version (NIV) 18 Then Jesus came to them and said, ‚ÄúAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them TO OBEY EVERYTHING I HAVE COMMANDED you.

For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.

2020-05-23T22:26:32,"Please do not misunderstand Sha‚Äôul (Paul).  II Peter 3:16  The covenant was renewed or Paul would have never said this:  Acts 24:14  ‚ÄúAnd this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the Elohim (God) of my fathers, (Exodus) 3:15 believing all that has been written in the Torah (Law) and in the Prophets  üòéüïé  And this ~   Romans 7:25  Thanks to Elohim (God), through ◊ô◊î◊ï◊©◊¢ (Yahushua) Messiah our Master! So then, with the mind I myself truly serve the Torah (Law) of Elohim, but with the flesh the torah of sin.   They often say the Torah is to hard. Again; a teaching of men. Deuteronomy 30:11  ‚ÄúFor this command which I am commanding you today, it is not too hard for you, nor is it far off.  Again, Paul agrees‚Ä¶..‚Äùbelieving all that has been written in the Torah and in the Prophets‚Äù Acts 24:14b   Mathew 4:4 & Luke 4:4 literally quotes Deuteronomy 8:3 word for blessed word. ‚ÄúMan shall live by EVERY WORD.....‚Äù   Deuteronomy 29:29  ‚ÄúThe secret matters belong to ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (Yahweh) our Elohim, but what is revealed belongs to us and to our children forever, to do all the Words of this Torah.   To be ‚Äúunder Torah‚Äù is often meant as being under the curse of Torah for disobeying Torah!  Deuteronomy 30:9-11  ‚ÄúAnd ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (Yahweh) your Elohim (God) shall make you have excess in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground for good. For ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î turns back to rejoice over you for good as He rejoiced over your fathers, if you obey the voice of ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î your Elohim, to guard His commands and His laws which are written in this Book of the Torah, if you turn back to ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î your Elohim with all your heart and with all your being. ‚ÄúFor this command which I am commanding you today, it is not too hard for you, nor is it far off.  The Torah is perfect (Psalms 19:7) and truth (Psalms 119:152/ John 1:1-7) and Spiritual    Many have taught that the law opposes the Spirit. ü§®  Romans 7:14  For we know that the Torah (Law) is >Spiritual<, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.   Obviously not! ^  üôÑ  Be very careful not to Twist Scripture 2 Peter 3:16.  Many use Paul‚Äôs Words (Especially Galatians) to try and disprove Torah observance based on their lack of understanding concerning scriptural contexts. The Apostle Peter warns us not to misunderstand Paul in 2 Peter Chapter 3.  Peter tells us that Yahweh gave Paul wisdom!  And I am well aware of the ‚ÄúPaul‚Äù bashing going on out there.  Peter predicted that would happen. üò¢   ‚ÄúTherefore, dear friends, as you look for these things, do everything you can to be found by him without spot or defect and at peace. And think of our Lord‚Äôs patience as deliverance, just as our dear brother Sha‚Äôul (Paul) also wrote you, following the wisdom Yahweh gave him. Indeed, he speaks about these things in all his letters. They contain some things that are hard to understand, things which the uninstructed and unstable distort, to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures. But you, dear friends, since you know this in advance, guard yourselves; so that you will not be led away by the errors of the wicked and fall from your own secure position. And keep growing in grace and knowledge of our Master and Deliverer, Yahushua the Messiah. To him be the glory, both now and forever! Amen.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠2 Kefa (2 Peter) 3:14-18‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠  They will even twist those verses!! üö´üò±  But I digress. üò¨üòáüëçüèΩ  The Covenant was new to us, not God. Malachi 3:,6:   Mal 3:6  ‚ÄúFor I am ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î, I shall not change, and you, O sons of Ya‚Äõaqo·∏á (Yisra‚Äôel), shall not come to an end.  There is no gentile replacement for Israel, you are now physical Israeli.  Ephesians 2:11 and Galatians 3:19 to name a few references.
