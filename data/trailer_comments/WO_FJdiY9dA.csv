Trailer for Gingerclown: https://youtu.be/3YJt5WmXPW8  The reasons I wanna see a remake of this movie is because it was released in 2012 but made in 1980 style. The monsters were puppeteered, no explanation why the monsters are at the abandoned park in the first place or how they were made or where they came from or why they eat human flesh. Plus the script was poorly written and it just has a healthy dose of dumb. And the scene where the jock dies, I don‚Äôt understand how all his skin came off just by getting spun in circles on a ride. And the one scene with the spider, literally a shotgun came straight out of nowhere. For real. There‚Äôs a lot of scenes I don‚Äôt understand and I feel like this movie really deserves a remake with better scripting, better actors, better monsters (like use CGI and not puppets), plus an explanation on how the monsters  were created and why they eat humans. If it does end up getting remade, I‚Äôd be okay if you guys worked on remaking this film with Blumhouse. Plus for actors, I‚Äôd like to see Samara Weaving play Jenny, Robbie Amell as Sam, Chris Hemsworth as Biff, Bill Skarsg√•rd as Gingerclown, Mark Hamill as Wormface, and Fiona Dourif as Nelly the Spiderwoman.

On the other hand, it's rather odd to see a Universal movie monster with the (apparently) singular goal of just ruining one persons life. If the women being stalked dies or disappears, does the Invisible Man have to get a new girlfriend to continue obsessing over, or is he just done? It also seems like a pretty solvable problem, unless for some reason the woman being stalked here has no friends or credibility at all, or the Invisible Man has other super-powers.

It was almost like a possession or haunting film, especially with the orchestrated soundtrack. This is a must see film. We just got out of the movies earlier!!  My friend Glenn went with me and my wife to the show. This brand new The Invisible Man that came out yesterday was the best movie I've seen in a while! Absolutely awesome film. They turned the idea of The Invisible Man into a very violent and scary story you would not expect. It also has a very wicked orchestrated soundtrack reminiscent of an older horror film. It sends chills down your spine. The storyline is how the wife of a psychopathical scientist who developes high tech experimental gadgetry, stalks her in invisible form, after convincing everyone of his death,  and terrorizes her, after she flees their home in the middle of the night to escape him, since he is terrorizing in her everyday life as well. She soon realizes he is not dead, but invisible and hunting her. There are scenes after he finds her where she is being held up off the ground and beaten by this invisible man, kind of like in the old thriller The Entity or a demonic possession thriller. He kills people violently and blames it on her. She ends up being committed to an insane asylum since everyone thinks she's imagining it. But eventually she finds a way to fight back.

I have read the book and seen the original motion picture in 1968 in my opinion this picture is crazy how ex-boyfriend or boyfriend Jack Griffin is going to kill his wife what the hell is this I guess Universal just want to make more money that's all.... and another thing the scene takes place in Australia in the book it was in ipen on the outskirts of London England where HG Wells was born and where the book was based on !!!! This version of the Invisible Man is the worst movie I ever seen but what makes the money on this picture is the special effects as always stands out!!! And why would Jack Griffin's wife go crazy and why would Jack Griffin's leave a will when I saw this picture I just died laughing and I'm quite sure HG Wells is laughing too oh and by the way this is one of the reasons why Johnny Depp don't want to be in this movie he was holding out for more money but they decided to drop him anyway and they make Elisabeth Moss the principal character why the second banana who played The Invisible Man is well known on Netflix if the situation was in reverse and Johnny Depp accept the offer Johnny Depp would be first and Elisabeth Moss to be billed as second banana,0,0,david morris,WO_FJdiY9dA,0.03000944368131869,2020-03-06 11:33:22,False,True

2020-03-14T02:22:05,Went to go see this with my boyfriend today and we left the cinema mind-blown. Has to be one of the best movies I have seen so far this year and the best thriller I have experienced in the cinema.

2020-04-24T06:28:26,"Oh my goodness! I wanted to hate this movie so much after reading the title of it. I for sure thought it was going to be cheesy but this was A_Awesome! It was a very well put together movie. The use of ""modern/futuristic"" technology gave it it's own sense of added horror to the mix. It gives the viewer that extra edge of creepy by influencing the thought of such thing existing amongst us this very moment or at least century. That's what blew my mind most about this movie! Well, finally after many years, I'm now replacing a movie from ""Top 5 All Time Favorite Movies!"" hands down!  If you don't won't to read any spoilers...READ NO FURTHER.....  What I think made me love this movie so much was how the Director, writer or whomever (thank you whomever that is) made it happen....to whereas, the movie could've split off into at least two diff maybe even three possible timelines. Now I may be high as hell rn but hear me out okay. Lol, alright, now.....OMG Yoooo. I had to pause for a few minutes to actually watch the trailer and let me tell you something! For the first time in a while, I'm glad I watched a movie before the trailer. There were some scenes that weren't in the movie that were in the trailer and there were scenes shown in the trailer that weren't in the final cut of the movie! I'm sure they were moved into the ""Extras"" on Blu-Ray and what not but that's not my point. Watching that trailer right after the movie was like watching a short of short-film in in-itself. A blast all over again but in one big rush all at once! Phew....alright, back to my original comment. How the movie could've changed into different directions...SPOILER ALERT AGAIN....At one hour, twenty-six minutes, and thirteen seconds into the movie is a scene where Cecilia's standing in the shower of her cell within the psych-ward that she has been emitted into impales her wrist with a fountain pen and begins to slice downward after saying aloud, ""You won't get the baby and you won't get me!""...I hate to interrupt this program but SPOILER ALERT again....If Cecilia's boyfriend Adrian had killed that last officer (even though this officer wasn't used or even shown later on in the movie) he could've been a witness to her case had she been seized and ""captured"" again. That being he told the truth and the jury and judge believe him...then you have the trails and blah, blah, blah... Okay so then you also have an alternate route where Cecilia kills Adrian and all, well, most (being as though the use of his brother isn't immediately known yet) of the evidence she'd need to plead innocent in her case would be present and accountable for. Followed by trials and blah..blah..blah....Alright, now stick with me just a bit longer alright......ah crap. My high is coming down now and my what I think at least is a ""creative writing style"", is starting to die down. But another scene where things could've taken for a turn is at 1:47:57.....this is where Adrian is hinted to be revealing himself to the audience right before the big scene! This announcement was presented in a way that's like a strong undertone. While not quite sitting on the surface level but by subconsciously insinuating that he was indeed the original ""Invisible Man"". And this is in fact the case as followed by the upcoming scene (The revenge) But what also backs this is up at 1:48:07....""the change in pitch"". The sound engineers emphasized Adrian saying, ""I mean ugh...that shouldn't come as ugh...SURPRISE."" And then the horrifying, heart wrenching laughter followed by tears of rejoice relay that she, ""Cecelia"", had also picked up on this. In fact, she well has may have wished, and hoped for that to be the case as she planned her night ending accordingly. I saw it coming but then again, I really didn't and that too was just great! I could go on an on but I should go. Anyway's there were also scenes in trailer that I mentioned earlier that were shown in the trailer but not in the movie. One, being the hand-print being created on the glass shower door or the pronounced breathing effect being blown next to Cecelia when standing on the front porch of Jame's home as seen here at 1:10 in this video. Man....this is one of those movies that would've been perfect to watch in theaters since you'd have those moments where you'd hear the gasp sounds of a few or even maybe a large group of people picking up on ques within the movie. Or hearing the sounds of potential others expressing the same amount of excitement over the movie as you are! Damn you corona! Anyway's it's 2AM. I'm going to take my tired high ass to sleep now. Hopefully this comment is able to be shared and found amusing by others!    Also, one tip, (If possible) watch this movie with your volume being comfortably set higher than you normally listen at. I believe this to be a contributing factor to the amount of immersiveness that I was doused in while watching this movie.",9,0,DJHeroMasta,WO_FJdiY9dA,0.11738451363451365,2020-04-24 06:28:26,False,True

Elisabeth Moss is beautiful and anyone would become obsessed to an unhealthy degree... Kidding! Joking aside, abusive people aren't stable or rational people. They come to think of their partners, family, and kids as their property and will do insane things to keep them... even if they don't seem to want them, considering how they treat them. They see someone leaving them as a humiliation and HAVE to make them pay for that humiliation.  I dated a girl in highschool whose father was abusive and sexually abused her as a kid. She was from Seattle and we lived in Florida, and he broke out of jail in Oregon and came _all the way across the country_ to stalk her at our highschool! Apparently it was my fault! Her mother told him she finally moved on with her life and was happy with a nice guy and that just broke this sick fucker. He was so enraged that his daughter was dating that he broke out of fucking jail! He then went to the one obvious place, assaulted 3 minors, got attempted murder on a teacher, and set a car on fire. We think he thought it was my car... because it was an Acura also, and I drove an '09 Acura TSX, he burned a faculty members car and when he ran out to see what happened this dude beat him with a wrench or something... almost killed him! (He was a good science teacher too.. nice dude.)  Our parents gave us a thousand bucks and told me to just drive and not tell them where and not to text, and wait for them to contact us. We went to Orlando and had to stay there for 9 days before they caught him.. he was caught at the school trying to offer students alcohol and drugs for information to where her friends lived. Friggin psycho!  Those types of people are fucking insane and will never act in a logical way. If a guy like that had access to invisibility I'm 100% sure he would use it.
