2020-05-14T02:34:10,"Because of all the negative reviews I've avoided watching Jexi for the longest time, which is a shame because it was hilarious. It defines the iPhone generation (and Samsung too!) perfectly.   It starts out as a cautionary tale about what could happen to you if you callously agree to the infamous User Agreement without reading it first (hint: we all do it). USER better f*king BEWARE or ELSE!

2020-05-15T13:11:35,This movie had me crying laughing.. Like legit may be the best romantic comedy I've seen in ten years. I watched twice in one nite and this had one of the worst ratings I have EVER seen on rotton tomatoes. Like in this entire film there was maybe a solid five minutes I wasn't laughing out loud.
