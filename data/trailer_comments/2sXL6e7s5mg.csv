I know I javnt been to school in 20 years,but I am friends with a few teachers,and,i find it hard to believe that a professor teaching philosophy would ever act this way.i can see telling the class to tone down the Christian vs. non Christian debates(and therefor the metaphor god is dead-as in this class),but I have never met a teacher who strays from the course study to advance a hidden agenda of his/her own beliefs. anyhow,the movie actually looks pretty good,and im glad that the Christians have another movie to fall in love with,but keep it in perspective.more people than not are Christian in America(some form of Christianity,anyhow),which is why I find it amusing everytime they complain about religious freedoms or persecution.because of my beliefs,i tend to roll in the same circles with like minded non believers,and I mention this because I have never met a non believer who ""hates"" Christianity,or god for that matter.not believing is not the same as hating. as for religious freedom,it seems the more religious you are,the less you actually believe in its freedom. today alone on my facebook newsfeed there are at least 20-30 pro religious posts that ive scrolled over,from the person who quotes scripture every single day to the semi moronic end of times believers who keep spreading misinformation and propaganda disguised as news...every.single.day...yet if I post even one comment or article that is anti religion or clashes with any religious views,comments come in from all directions trying to save me or praying for my soul. anyhow,im getting off topic. im happy that a movie was made that all Christians can be proud of, but enough already with the religious persecution bs...",1,0,Chris Betz,2sXL6e7s5mg,0.06243799603174604,2014-03-13 03:22:21,True,True

And He is frowning upon the practice of evangelicalism, where people go around and suffocate others with their religion because they think they can decide what's best for everyone. If someone wanted to learn about christianity, or islam, they could go to a church or a mosque. You don't need to go around forcing your religion on to people. Like the guy in this trailer: ""What I want is for them to make their own choice that's what God wants.""  And I think this movie is going to spread my point of view fabulously.

2014-03-24T00:03:12," Proverbs 26:4-14  Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you will be like him yourself. Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes. Like cutting off one's feet or drinking violence is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool. Like a lame man's legs that hang limp is a proverb in the mouth of a fool. Like tying a stone in a sling is the giving of honor to a fool.  Like a thorn bush in a drunkard's hand is a proverb in the mouth of a fool. Like an archer who wounds at random is he who hires a fool or any passer-by.   1 Corinthians 1: 18-25  For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written:  “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”  Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.

I see that some people are bothered by the portrayal of some of the characters in this movie, I can understand that to an extent, however, in reality many people in the world ARE that way if not more-so. I've been around the world and I've lived in America for 32 years...

On the other hand in mainstream films and in the media in general, ""christians"" are made to look like bigots and idiots with no legitimate reasons to believe in what many atheists call a ""sky daddy."" Well...  This movie DEMOLISHES those anti-God notions with absolute TRUTH and more proof of who He is than who He isn't!! The main point of this movie is the real life DEBATE details, not the characters. Anyway you look at it, if you pay attention to and and take all stances into account with the debates in a REAL LIFE manner, you won't be able to go by in life Truly believing that there is no God... our Creator!  You could say that I'm easily swayed and brainwashed, ignorant and need a crutch, but according to all things that matter in life, it's just the opposite.   You'll also see that there were at least 40, yes FORTY --> REAL-LIFE, DOCUMENTED, COURT CASES HERE IN AMERICA that took place because of similar events of discrimination and hate towards ""Christian"" groups and students on college campuses. Yes, even here in America and to this very day - and growing!  Lastly, please remember this if nothing else from this review: As you all go throughout life meeting people who claim to be Christians (simply meaning: a follower of Jesus Christ) yet they display any HATE towards anyone... it's got to be legitimate 'hate'... What do I mean?  Well to clarify, just because one may disagree with something or someone or ANY particular act or lifestyle (those lifestyles go beyond homosexuality though that may be included...) does NOT mean that they ""hate"" them at all)... Now back to the original point-- Not everyone who claims to be a Christian truly is one. What do I mean? Well, standing in a garage all day, everyday will not turn a person into a car. And the same applies to church, just because someone goes doesn't make them a true Christian...   God does love ALL people whether we hate Him or believe in Him or not. At His essence He IS love, He created it (1 John 4:8) and He wants you to know that He does love YOU, despite the sins we've all committed, despite ANYTHING any of us has ever done or didn't do. That's why He sent his only son, Jesus Christ, to die for ALL of mankind, every ethnicity, every nationality, every religion, EVERY person. Seems so cliché, but it's so true: John 3:16. And finally, read: Romans 10:9-10.  The decision is our own. Free will. It all comes down to whether we receive or reject the Love of God through His only Son, Jesus Christ. God bless you all.

His wife, who happened to be one of his former students leaves him, because she's tired of being made a fool for her belief in the Christian God.  There is a daughter of a Muslim man who gets thrown out of the house, because her younger brother tattled on her about being a Christian.  That plot leads to her being homeless or something, plus there's a scene of her being smacked around by her Muslim dad before being kicked out of the house.  She is also forced to wear the head-scarf.    This reporter gets dumped by her rich boyfriend, because he sees her 'dying of cancer' as an inconvenience to their relationship.  He also has a mother that has dementia.  His mother doesn't even recognize him and he barely visits.  Also, God doesn't NEED  a cruddy-ass Christian flick to defend him.

If people would come up for air once in awhile they could take a step back and realized that the Bible is just one big story book of colorful characters, good object lessons and moral lessons but also shows a God that is as demented as any serial killer in history. Sorry religious people but the god you worship in that irrational, illogical loophole filled violent and demented children's book is worse than the devil you all fear. It's either worship me or Im going to burn you alive for all eternity and still pretend to be a good benevolent creator..  Seriously, wake the fuck up people. I'm not saying drop your faith at all but take a step back and use your logical minds and stop being led around like sheep by blind shepards who really don't know what they are talking about.

The truth of the matter is that most atheists have a lack of belief in god/gods because no god has been proven. Strong atheism is the assertion that there are no gods, and such an assertion cannot be definitively proven in my opinion. It successfully shifts the burden of proof onto the atheist, instead of keeping it where it belongs with the theist. Additionally, atheism and agnosticism are not mutually exclusive. I classify myself as an atheist agnostic because I do not believe in any god, but I cannot know for certain whether or not a god exists based on an abject lack of evidence.

2015-10-12T22:43:32,"I base my belief in God off of personal experience of His Presence in my life. I was once an evolutionist, but now I am thoroughly convinced of His reality. The Bible gives us assurances that God is the Creator of all life on the earth. However I am not a believer that the earth is only 6,000 years old. I do not believe this Biblically or scientifically. Actually, I literally debated Ken Ham on a radio call-in show on this very point. You know the scientific arguments, but the Biblical argument is in Genesis  ""In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void; (in Hebrew this is more accurately translated: ""a desolation and a waste"")  and darkness was upon the face of the deep And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water.  So here you already have 1. The earth in a wasted and desolate state 2.Water  So my argument with Ken Ham was... Isn't the Bible really describing God doing a total re-creation/terra-forming of the surface of the earth and atmosphere? And we know God is eternal. Why should we fear a very old earth?  So bear with me please..... If we are dealing with an omnipotent, omniscient Creator, scientists, like organizing a deck of cards, could organize all life which He created, according to complexity in traits and similarity in genetic code, theorize that one stemmed from another, but it still would not mean it was so. We would need more evidence than that.  God is great. His greatness spans across the entire spectrum of Creation, and His intelligence vastly outstrips ours.  What should we be looking for as proof that evolution were true?  1. We should see it happening around us, all the time. That is what the theory demands. Ongoing, persistent genetic progress.  In other words, we observe only genetic stability and microevolution within a species. (hummingbirds with different lengths of beaks....turtles with different colored shells, variety in dogs, hybrids, etc.) But macroevolution (one species evolving into another) is not observed on a enormous scale. If evolutionary theory is true, EVERYTHING is evolving into other species ALL THE TIME.  2. The number of ""transitory species"" should be more than the actual ""whole species"" themselves. It's a cop-out to say, ""Well, all of those transitory species didn't make it!"" Or to say, ""Look at the platypus folks! There it is....a transitory species!""  3. We need an unseen organizational force that is organizing all life. Newton said it takes a force to move an object, therefore it takes a force to organize objects, even molecules to make molecular cellular structures. Remember Legos? You were the one building the castle. But what force is building the ""castle"" of cellular structures on an unfathomable scale? I  remember my biology teacher in high school saying one cell is as complicated as a city. Life is highly organized. But where is the force?  4. We need some way to continuously insert new DNA instruction into species, because those changes in species would have to have a genetic blueprint in their cells to produce the desired result. It cannot come from SUBTRACTION of information. If you ADD a new feature, you must ADD instruction for that feature.  4. Even if you could overcome the aforementioned hurdles, and  pretend that macroevolution exists, you would still have hurdles. So say you somehow had the DNA in place for a more advanced eye in a frog, for example. That frog would only advance forward that trait at 50%. ""Froggie would go a-courting"" with the advanced trait, and meet Miss Lucy Frog with the average eye, and the one advance would disperse in a few generations. In a frog world that could translate to a few years. Think of it in human terms. Arnold Schwarzenegger is not going to have all überhuman beefy babies.  5.Each time a species had a quality to be passed forward it would simultaneously need a fully intact reproductive system in place at every stage of the game. Okay, so the universe somehow make one cell accidentally....? You need it all there in one generation, or end of story.  I give God the Father the glory for the inspiration of these debate points.
