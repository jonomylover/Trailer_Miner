2018-06-07T14:49:06,I don't get it. Rooney Mara was replaced so there must be a reason why. The obvious one is that she did not bring as much an audience or the movie didn't do as well as the company wanted it. So they change director and actress and now you are missing the Rooney. I mean you haven't seen the end product. And from this trailer the movie looks very strong. But we have to wait and see.

2018-06-07T15:15:23,"While I understand that Dragon Tattoo didn't turn as much of a profit as the studio wanted, this certainly won't make anywhere near the Dragon Tattoo's box office. The problem, money-wise was that Fincher made Dragon Tattoo for $90 million, which made it's $232.6 million box office numbers look less impressive. However, a crime thriller making in the 200 millions is fucking impressive. Sure, it was made expensively, and as such, the profit was lower, but the pure box office numbers are intense. And, by all accounts, I believe the sequels would do even better. Because, when Fincher was making his trilogy, the books were at their peak of popularity, they had earned an Oscar nomination for Rooney Mara, they had Daniel Craig in a starring role (who is certainly still a draw, considering Bond), and on top of that, they would have gotten increased word of mouth and DVD watchers who went to the theater to watch the next two movies. And as of now, the popularity of the Millenium series has certainly dipped and what this movie doesn't have is popular source material, or recognizable stars beyond Claire Foy (who still isn't a huge box office draw of a star, despite being a great actress), and on top of all of that, has the added strain of behind the scenes drama and fans of the Fincher film feeling cheated and refusing to see this movie. So while at the moment, it looked like Dragon Tattoo wasn't the success they were hoping for, Fincher's trilogy had much better odds to become that success than this film does, and it was incredibly short-sighted to trade in that trilogy, which would've come out at the optimal time, for this film which is coming out a few years too late",29,4,Akshay Bhatia,XKMSP9OKspQ,0.2800170068027211,2018-06-07 15:15:23,True,True

Not only are we looking so far into the future from the 2011 installment, but Sony has slashed the originally directly, talent, and the source material is from a different author all together. If you don't know, Stieg Larson initially started the Millennium Series with the first three books, The girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest. David Lagercrantz continued the series into the latest installments, The Girl in the Spider's Web and The Girl who Takes an Eye for an Eye. In the last two installments we have a much lighter Salander and she isn't nearly the brunt-force we saw earlier in the series. Many people have attributed that to the new author's reinvisionment for the character; and it's something that not everyone agrees with. I'm impartial.

2018-12-09T11:55:55,I have just watched this film. It was very enjoyable and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Shame about all the negative  reviews  I read all 3 of Larsson's books (which is what got me into all this). I LOVED his books. May his soul rest in peace  I have watched all the Films on Lisbeth since then. All brilliant  Admittedly I have not read the latest book by the new author David Lagacrantz -  and it appears people who did-  were disappointed that the autistic boy in the book was not carried over in this movie as the actor spoke too much.    I am yet to see any movie do a good job of translating a well written book to a film. It is always difficult to translate those nuances you can dive into in a book. A luxury you do not have in a time constrained movie  Be that as it may - this film has does not deserve the negativity it has received. All the actors and actresses including the cute kid did an excellent job!  It seems unfair to make comparisons to the other tattoo films (which were also brilliant!)  People need to give this film a  chance and if you still have not watched it - please go watch it,10,0,God's Child,XKMSP9OKspQ,0.25949197860962564,2018-12-09 11:55:55,False,True

2019-03-26T20:47:23,"It's a turkey of a movie. I watched it at the cinema and left after an hour, and tried again on DVD months later but lasted an hour ten minutes. The brilliant Claire Foy (love her in The Crown and Unsane) struggles with a ridiculous screenplay. Characters seem to get immediate access to data they need, or know where hidden objects are without justification. Salander knows where the controls are that raise the bridge and knows how to work them. Needham at the airport correctly guesses there's a hidden phone in a closed bin without having any reason to suspect it. Salander drives a car and does stunt driving only moments after having been given a powerful tranquilizer which she has (apparently) managed to neutralise completely by sniffing crushed amphetamine tablets (which she miraculously finds and identifies in a bathroom that is not hers and while half unconscious). When the characters produce a checkmate in a chess game they resign the game by laying the king down (a checkmate doesn't need resignation)?!! The boy plays Salander (an experienced player) at chess, walks away from the board, and announces a checkmate to Salander's surprise - as if she couldn't notice it for herself! Stephen Merchant is just not believable as a scientist. I'm expecting him to crack a joke any second. No one is emotionally connected to anyone. OK, so it wants to be a Jason Bourne movie but the script just lacks intelligence. Claire Foy gives her character some depth but if the screenplay doesn't work then the actors are swimming in treacle. Who on earth gave the green light to this screenplay?! Was there no budget for script development?!!",0,1,barryispuzzled,XKMSP9OKspQ,0.06941773504273505,2019-03-26 20:47:23,False,False

Futhermore although i haven't read any of the books ( if there are more than one)  i don't believe that the main character aids only oppressed women  i believed that she was a regular vigilante, fighting for justice.
