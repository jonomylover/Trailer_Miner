2014-08-27T23:53:44,"Ok you know what? I loved the idea of this book but honestly it is the worst book I've ever read. Maybe it's because I've been playing violin for 8 years, and maybe it's not. But I have a few things to discuss. 1. Gayle Foreman has clearly never played an instrument, judging by her lack of any musical knowledge whatsoever. There is NO WAY POSSIBLE that Mia could ever be that good just by taking lessons from a college student and then a guy who works at a record store. Also I should mention that the song in the trailer is NOT Beethoven's 3rd cello sonata. Also, she would never, ever leave her cello at school, even if her life depended on it. 2. This book was terribly written. Don't get me wrong, the idea is AMAZING, but the book was terrible. The accident just somehow popped up a few pages in, and it goes by way too quickly. Plus, all sometimes it's best NOT to describe every single detail of the accident. I literally wanted to throw up. 3. The character Mia is terrible. She tries to get you on her side by saying everything she hates about herself. In TFIOS, at least Hazel Lancaster is sarcastic about her bad features, but Mia is just plain terrible. She is really smart and really pretty, but she is always talking about how she doesn't deserve adam, yaddah yaddah yaddah. Also, she's selfish. How is Adam more important than her dead family? Why does Adam being alive help her make her decision and not HER ENTIRE FAMILY BEING DEAD not??????
