The true test of character is how you treat everyone including the people that are different.My favorite people are the ones that always smile and happy and just jive with everyone and are true genuine people that are not going to stab you in the back.

If so, is it for the better or worse? 4)Would Simons phobia of Monkeys and hatred of his own father suggest that he was sexually abused himself? 5)How long were the Callums married before all this? 6)Do you truly know the person you married? 7)Although the answers pretty clear for some, when Simon shoved and pinned him to the floor, why did Gordo for a military man not fight back? 8)Is the idea of an heinous act more powerful than the deed itself? 9)Is the baby Simons or Gordo's? 10)How fitting was Simon for the manner Gordo took his revenge?",36,50,Senate300,I3IiZU9JBuE,0.16130434782608696,2015-10-10 11:48:44,False,True

Joel Edgerton is the writer & director and he also plays Gordo in this , the so called bad guy and he does really good job. Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall are good too as the couple who move into a new house in California only to find an old friend hanging around more than they would like.
