The reviews of various critics on board the IMDb website have been unfair regarding the overall rating of this film, however with a 7.1 it's not short of a decent approval. I believe the critics of this film expected more comedy and less seriousness.  Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would describe it as a shorter version of the Wolf Of Wall Street, mixed with comedic action. The length of the film allows an ease of watching, opposed to the supposedly 'longwinded' Wolf Of Wall Street.
