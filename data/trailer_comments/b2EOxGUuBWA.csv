MGM is, of course, free to green light and finance any prospective script it believes will make money - it is a free country after all.  However, it looks to be just another current hot-button issue movie executives (mainly white men) feel they can make a buck on - with complete disregard for taking on the true issues that plague the billion(s) dollar Hollywood industry - and they are 'banking' on it.
