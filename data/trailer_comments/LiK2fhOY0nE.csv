2017-07-22T20:20:39,"from just analyzing the trailer: the year is 2045 and the economy is in an all time low as you can see by the city called ""the Stacks"" as the kid calls it which looks like stacks of small bungalow homes that look almost like a car junkyard or a junkyard in general, and the main characters generation is called ""the missing generation"" because they are absent from society and maybe they have not influenced society in anyway since they resort to escaping into an ""oasis"" a fake reality (VR).   It would be very scary to see this as the United states future, and the reason being is because an absent generation paves the way for the government to easily control what happens next and maybe make it easier for the next generation to be controlled. i bet the generation that comes after will be even more absent than the 2045 generation.... although, i have not read the book i wonder if it ends with him leaving the ""oasis"", and i hope that generation abandons the VR world  and helps bring back the economy in some way but i highly doubt it because the US looks like a third world country in this story.   I love that they included Kanedas Bike from the anime movie akira, but does that mean that Warner bros. owns the rights to akira. Will this mean that in the future there might be a real life adaptation to the anime movie, since, it seems kanedas bike is like a teaser to whats to come next.   i cant wait to watch it, because i love these futuristic dystopian movies.",0,0,Roosting-Chicken,LiK2fhOY0nE,0.012954545454545458,2017-07-22 20:20:39,True,True

The bike: a modified version of the one in Akira  Sixxers ingame: System of a Down - BYOB, official video Sixxers irl: the helmets from Starship Trooper The couple passing Wade on his way into Og's party: Deadpool and Harley Quinn There's also a space ship from Warhammer 40k in the same scene, floating on the far left Freddy Kruger (who explodes into coins as he's shot), the Iron Giant and the DeLorean are obvious (note the energy boosters on the DeLorean and that the number plate says ""Parzival) The first key won't be found through jousting, the joust reference is actually in the scene with the scorpion.  Lara Croft is in the scene with all the cars Gandalf's dancing in zero-g The one shooting the rocket in the scene where Freddy Kruger gets shot is the protagonist of Duke Nukem There's a treasure chest in Wade's hideout  The thing that sets the time in the DeLorean is set to 1985 (an obvious back to the future reference) and also to the 20th of july 2045 (Ready Player One plays in that year, as well as Doc Brown saves the world, a short movie that is most likely the source of the reference... DeLorean and all. Trivia: it could also be a reference to TekWar, 2045: A Story of our Future, Ace Combat 3, The Outward Urge, American Dad, Critters 4, Command&Conquer: Tiberium Wars, Macross 7 and Angels and Airwaves, all of these either play in 2045 or at least the date plays a role)  The guy shooting Freddy Kruger is wielding a MA5B, an assault rifle from the Halo franchise The text on the displays next to the street at the car scene says ""Find the copper key"", putting this into context. Seems the street chase is somewhere in the early parts of the film. The scene with the broken bridge COULD be a reference to Carrera racing tracks, toys from Germany popular in the 80s. The arrows painted on the street look VERY similar. Also note how the cars all move in the middle of the road and how there are wheel burns that could mirror the rails in Carrera tracks.

And if you haven't read the book... please go read it! It is such a good read and totally worth it!! Now for my rant... (spoilers ahead)  I stopped watching this trailer 3 seconds into it... because the first line is false. Wade did not live in Columbus, Ohio in the stacks originally. When he lived in the stacks it was in Oklahoma City. The IOI corporation blew up his stack, creating many others to fall and leaving lots of people dead. However, Wade was lucky enough to be in his hideout. Thus, he took a bus to Columbus, Ohio to escape the IOI corporation. So in conclusion, the first line of this trailer is wrong. Which, very much so, upsets me. However, I will still go and see the movie, I just want to let you know that it is even more inaccurate then what I thought it was going to be... So read the book!!!

They don’t sell that at all. 2. “fastest growing city on earth”, “missing generation”       a. These quotes sound lame and don’t really add much to the setting. It feels like they’re trying to sell the oasis as perfect and that “there’s nowhere else to go” in the real world without telling us why. b. I’d much rather they not sugarcoat it and say the earth is in an energy crisis with tons of people out of work and living in stacks of trailers with nowhere to go. It should present it like a post-nuclear apocalypse type setting. 3. The car racing looks cool.. but it’s totally made up. a. I don’t recall any race occurring in the story b. I also don’t think this even compares to some of the action scenes that really happened in the book.. fighting robots, space ships, puzzles, playing the role of the main character inside the movie War Games?

However, I understand they do have to change some things to make a good movie.  Such as having the Gate Challenges be action-packed video game sequences, instead of obscure 80s trivia challenges, or show-downs on a classic 80s arcade game against an AI opponent.   In a way, it makes more sense to have competitive video game action sequences when multiple players are trying for the key at once.  This would ensure that only a few people can get the key, rather than having scenes where, say, hundreds of IOI employees each have a copy of the key.  The big plus is the original author of the book worked closely with Spielberg so the changes should still keep the essence of the book.

2017-07-27T23:00:17,"(Someone prove me wrong,PLEASE!) I feel so sorry for Warner Bros. right now. It looks awesome, but that can be said about almost any film trailer since they cherry pick scenes. First problem: the ""future fucking sucks"" trope! We've seen it EVERYWHERE! Video games, movies, books, comics and even FANFICTIONS. The ""gritty realism"" isn't realistic. Overpopulation, definitely a problem, has been countered by so many authors in POSITIVE FUTURES that seem more realistic than what it looks like we're being sold. Next problem: the vr-generation of teens and young adults. Yeah, the world sucks, but there are always other ways to maintain an engaged reaction from the youths. Books, games, conversing with the fellow human and hobbies. I'm an avid gamer, but if there's nothing else to do but game than this whole future would be countered by people NEVER LEAVING AND ACTIVELY STRUGGLING TO DESTROY THE LIFE THEY ARE FORCED TO LIVE! Final problem that bugs only me: the not subtle at all shout outs to popular nostalgia fuel. The Iron Giant, the Back To The Future car, the robotic cops and the video-gamey racetrack...Warner Bros. has made popular cameos or called in famous actors to hype up their  movies every now and again, but this just seems so desperate! When you've seen good Warner Bros. flics like The Exorcist, Harry Potter, Dark Knight and Twister; you know that they're not afraid to call in familiar names, but aren't going so far as to make sure you feel obligated to see it with huge names. The Casper movie, a weird example but roll with it, was so desperate to be watched that the people behind it called on the popularity of stars from blockbusters like Dan Akroyd from Ghostbusters or they called in big names like  Rodney Dangerfield, Terry Murphy and Mel Gibson. In this trailer, I've heard Tye Sheridan narrate over an assortment of awesome looking cgi with a few familiar characters or references that are GUARANTEED to get nostalgia nuts interested. Normally I'm fine seeing trailers or teasers with these things in them, but this is Steven fucking Spielberg who's not afraid to pull on popularity strings but these shout outs feel forced in and kind of scared. I don't want to be right, but I'm positive that I'm not the only one who's noticed how out of place those small nods feel and how they feel like a cry for movie goers to fill pockets. Good movies, Jurassic Park for instance, shook Hollywood with people who were people you mentioned offhandedly and MADE THEM huge. I feel like shit talking badly about a film I haven't even watched, but these things feel desperate and I NEED someone to prove my worries pointless. I'm kind of hoping that if this movie fails I'll be able to enjoy the book afterwards. Now I know the book has these shout outs, and that's fine, but seeing them so prominently shown in the teaser feels FUCKING DESPERATELY.

2017-07-28T01:50:04,"Wow, this looks really bad! Another trailer that looks nothing like the book. And that sucks, because I loved the book.   The references in the book, though, were so much clever because it was all themed around 80's pop culture, mostly retro games and  movies. This movie just look like a clusterfuck of incoherent references with no real theme, except that they're all basically Warner Bros product placement. Like, the Iron Giant and Lord of the Rings weren't even 80's movies. And no game references either, just movies. Even though it's about a game! It'd be like Ernest Cline saying ""I know this a about a game, but since it's a book, we'll throw in a bunch of book references.   The tone looks more gritty and modern, nothing like the fun and retro tone from the book. And I can't even tell who any of the characters are wrapped around they're Warner Bros product placement avatars. I'm told that the Cave Troll is Aech (which sucks, because that would dumb down an awesome subplot in the book) and Motorcycle girl is Art3mis, but It's bad when the director has to tell you who the other main characters are. We don't even see a single interaction between any of these characters. Just one bit of narration is are only dialogue. You know it's bad when you're whole trailer is just narration, then action. I can't imagine these characters will get much development either. Where's the plot either. For all I know, that'll probably be completely different too.  The action doesn't even look good, and in the trailer it cuts off before things can get exiting. It also seems like they completely ripped out the clever challenges form the book, like playing a real life Joust and acting in Wargames, in favor of things like terrible car chases.Did Stephen Spielberg even read the book!   There are some scenes that look faithful to the book, like the stacks, putting on the Oasis, and the IOI soldiers preparing for battle. But everything else looks completely different and shitty. It's a shame, because this will probably scare off people from a great book, like the Divergent films did.

I also think think that cline should have made Haliday a sucker for the 90's, since that would most likely be the key demographic for people reading the book and going to the movie for it. There were also many editing errors in the book, such as dates when Wade found his hideout in the stacks.

If I were to see a movie that is a carbon-copy of the book, there wouldn't be any surprises, its the directors job to give it their spin whilst keeping the gist and the basis of the films lore intact. And that's what i'm seeing here, is it different? Hell yes, but does it also look bad-ass, and something that will grab a nerds (like me) attention? Yes, 1000x's over.  Personally, i'm thrilled to see these changes, I cant wait to be surprised by what Spielberg will deliver, and i'm sure no-matter how different it is from the books, the differences will be things that the book readers can think ""I can see that happening in the world of Ready Player One.""",1,0,Emeric,LiK2fhOY0nE,0.2675,2017-09-19 23:43:22,True,True

There isn't a giant scorpion in the book. 0:56   Parzival was poor when he was living in the stacks, why is there a scene showing him entering a very developed world in 0:34 since the only place that he could go was Ludus.(And sometimes Aech took him to another place, but still don't makes sense because that would mean that he logout in a combat zone, what he never did).  There isn't a giant robot in the book 0:46. (Oh, there is, but is just in the final battle, and Parzival is controlling it) IOI workers, weren't robots, they were just normal men, and all with the same type of skin. 1:10 Players can't take the ""glass"" (I'm sorry I don't know the name in English) just as Wade did in 1:49 because, if they do they would probably die, if they were in a combat zone, and it looks like Wade was fighting.  Besides that, there is no chance of this movie become a good movie. Ready Player One has a lot of details that makes total difference in the context of the book. (The 25$ coin, Parzival and Aech friendship, Daito and Shoto, the love that Wade feel about At3mis) and it's impossible they put this in the movie, otherwise the movie would have 6 hours.

2017-11-06T20:19:03,I'm really worried how accurate this movie will be to the book. I'm not a huge die hard fan but so far I'm seeing a lot that they added in the movie that wasn't even close to book.  First in the beginning of the book Wade doesn't live in Columbus he lives in Oklahoma he doesn't move to Columbus till near the end. But I guess they did that so they could save time so that's understandable. Missing millions? That was added in and so was the death race. One thing that I loved about the book was it's clever. Wade and everyone else had to use there wit and there intelligence and from what they know about Halliday. They didn't simply do a death race to determine the victor. I'm really worried they wont use the same creativity and wit like Ernest did when he wrote the book.,11,6,Aaron Dolney,LiK2fhOY0nE,0.11152597402597401,2017-11-06 20:19:03,True,True

The stacks are too close, there is a minimum 20 foot distance and yet they seem at least 5 feet apart. Wade is heavier at the start of the book, and he lives in Oklahoma. The book never mentions the 'neckbrace' projection, only the projection of the actual VR-like googles into your iris. I'm guessing that 'neckbrace' thing is actually the facial expression scanner. Wade is never seen in his new apartment once he moves to Ohio, this will obviously be seen in the movie. Hopefully they add comedic relief with Max Headroom and Wade's baldness. I'm excited for this movie, Art3mis better be smoking hot and the other High Five better be looking fly as hell, mostly because they're level 99. Gunters better have a wide array of gear-outfits.

After the race is done we will be further introduced to the main characters and that will be that. Also when the first trailer gets released the movie is usually still in production, which means that the editor for the trailer probably gets only a handful of clips to work with. If the animators wanted to get the characters they are referencing right, because they were probably nervous about that, it would make sense for them to work on the scenes that included a lot of copyrighted characters first to give them time to correct any mistakes. The diamond key is there at the very end so the plot will ofc be the same as in the book, they just didn't have much to show but still wanted to get a teaser out for Comic-Con.",0,0,SaveMeMoon,LiK2fhOY0nE,0.10018315018315019,2017-11-15 23:25:38,True,True

Don't get me wrong, I still LOVE the book for resembling Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to me AND actually having a message in the end. Other than that, the CONSTANT over analytical fucking reference to every 80s nostalgia got old QUICK. On the subject of writing, there is soooo much cliche bullshit in the book that made me literally CRINGE. (The ENTIRE last chapter was just terrible.)   As I was reading, I couldn't help but think of what could have happened instead. None of my additions/alterations effected the references used in the book. They simply added to character development, pacing, and overall FEEL.  I told my girlfriend how I would have ended it, and she literally wept, having already read it before I had.  Cline isn't a very good author in my opinion, and the success of this book is the pure result of all the nostalgia inside.

Ready player one is one of the books that play out better in your head and should never be on the screen. Filled with all the retro feels you could want. Cline even mentions in the book the absurdity of the main character playing a joust match against a lich king. He knows this would be weird on screen, not sure why he green lit the movie deal.

2018-03-15T18:29:38,Funny shit. With telling people since the 1980s this is our future. Ahh. To be told you are crazy and see the world finally come into sync with the way you have seen it all along lol. Now that is what fucks with your sanity. Makes you wonder did the world catch up to you. Or did you head further into crazy land lol. But with the evidence at hand. It says we are no different than we used to be. Just grown up a lot. And see we were never crazy. The world just couldn't see the world the way we did because they can't see anything but what they are told to see. That this world works off of people letting others tell them what to do and how to feel. So break free from that existence. Become the best you can. I will admit I try and not let me ego get the best of me but seeing every single tech that I pictured would come out from the 80s to now feels pretty good lol. My teachers that thought I was nuts now think they are nuts and question everything seeing everything I said would happen happen lmao. The only 2 that have yet to happen are full planet VR. And the transferal of our minds to a digital system creating a new universe in one that our minds live on forever. And become seprate from us. Making us immortal. Or they could choose to upload their mind and end their body. To save it from the stuggle. But it becomes a new existance in one that fantasy and reality no longer have a boundary. They are the same thing. And no one will ever want to come out if we transfer those experiances back to our body. Scary shit. To see perfection and come back to a world so ugly. Who knows. Maybe this is not the first time we have followed this cycle. =P Enjoy the mind fuck btw. lol. I see shit past this even. But. It seems more like fantasy than reality because it just loops over and over in different ways that lead to a multiverse each time I process it. We are already building a multiverse we call the collective mind. The emergent property of the many individuals linking together to become more than the sole person can ever be. And as our knowledge grows so does our multiverse. AKA Perspective. We all live in the same world with our bodies. But our minds all exist in a different world. Some small changes. Some large. Some so big it doesn't make sense. And some. The lucky few. Exist in all perspectives. Take my advice when you go for the key. Enjoy the good and the bad. And never give up!. Make your story a great one!. Reach for the stars and become a legend!.,0,0,Robert Long,LiK2fhOY0nE,0.15175718221172765,2018-03-15 18:29:38,True,True

It was nice to see all those lively character at once:) Spielberg surely nailed it♡♡ although there was a bit difference from the novel which is originally written by ernest cline, but they did a marvelous job delivering all the significant component and message in the movie. It was epic to watch this film, never failed my expectations. tbh it was above my average expectation😊 i don't easily give 5 stars but this movie was a masterpiece. Totally deserves it. So awesome that you can never miss it** i highly recommend it❤ thanks to the main actors tye sheridan(parzival), olivia cooke(art3mis) who did a great job:) ya know, haters going to hate. Because critics can do whatever the heck they want to say. I respect both people who hate or either love this film. But hey, i'm a very simple person. I love what i'm seeing, i say nice thing when i see nice film. And i love to hear people who comment only nice thing about the movie. No need to fuss over it. They can hate and say this film was overrated but this film, to me, it was such a huge honor to witness this masterpiece. They did poured all their effort and devotion to this single film and i know because visual effects (vfx) and cgi was done so smoothly. You can't even tell the transformation the moment between before and after wade was about to put his own VR device on his head. For those who didn't noticed, go ahead and look up 'ready player one cgi transformation'.

He’s a part of a generation known as the missing millions, but he and those around him found solace in a virtual world known as OASIS. In that world, it’s possible to meet the Iron Giant and fight Freddy Krueger himself.  The movie is based on the debut novel from Fanboys screenwriter Ernie Cline, which is set in a near-future where virtual reality is commonplace. Wade Watts joins an international scavenger hunt in the virtual world to track down three clues left behind by OASIS’s founder. Whoever finds the three easter eggs gets control of the system itself. The book, ladened with references to everything from classic science fiction novels to video games to 1980s movies, became a huge fan favorite and bestselling novel.  The film will star Tye Sheridan (The Tree of Life / X-Men: Apocalypse) as Wade, while Olivia Cooke (Bates Motel) will play Art3mis. Ben Mendelsohn (Rogue One), Mark Rylance (Dunkirk), Simon Pegg (Star Trek, Shaun of the Dead), T.J. Miller (Silicon Valley), Hannah John-Kamen (Killjoys) also star.
