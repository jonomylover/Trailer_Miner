Too many pretty people running around in an environment that looks like it was set up to film a perfume commercial. Hopefully the plot proves me wrong. Still think it was unnecessary to bring back Ford. I was fine with the ambiguous (origami) ending of the Final Cut version.

It was unique: a philosophical sci-fi noir film, more theater and tone than blockbuster. This trailer is a bit flashy, most likely the doing of marketing and editing. We‚Äôve probably already seen most of the gunshots and explosions in this film.   Part of the beauty of the original, in all of its versions, was its ambiguity.  Was Deckard a replicant? What happened to him and Rachel? Based off of the trailer it appears the audience will get some answers. This could be a bad thing‚Äîor a good thing, but chances are slim. If anyone can do it, Denis is the guy. More likely is that he will retain most of the original‚Äôs ambiguity. I hope he does not answer too many questions‚Äîadmittedly I don‚Äôt think he will: he is a delightfully talented filmmaker whom I have faith in.

If they really are a part of this world then they're not going to be philosophizing about every little thing. AI robots have been around for decades so what's with all the grandiose talk. The cinematography looks technically excellent but there isn't a lot of grime or claustrophobia, or a distinct/coherent look to the film. The first film was very film-noir, cramped and dirty whereas in this I see a lot of different color palettes and styles, all very clean. In that sense it could be Total Recall or any other sci fi sequel. It's been through some dramatic color correction and that's too obvious. I'm not crazy about the casting choices. Nor am I crazy about Harrison Ford reappearing. He was what he was in the 80s and he doesn't have that charisma anymore, so it seems like he's there as a piece of nostalgia, handing off the mantle to Ryan Gosling. This type of thing worked ok in The Force Awakens, and it failed miserably in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but I've seen it twice already and I know I'm not interested in seeing it again. The little I've seen of Leto makes him look like a clich√© god figure, with none of the mystery or uniqueness of Tyrell in the first movie.

Every frame with him in it looks eye-roll inducing and also indicative of Denis Villieneve shameful attempt to cement his status in the imdb top 250.  Harrison Ford is there too, desperate to cling on to the virtues of his youth, despite destroying each of his iconic roles in the process. I'm sure old man Decard in a Hanes t-shirt throwing mediocre punches was oh so integral to this story. Reminds me of his role in Return of the Jedi where he spends the majority of the time trying to hack into a door, essentially playing no real part of the ongoing story. Even Ford himself admitted he should've been killed off long before in Empire. Why is Hollywood so intent on keeping Harrison around? Do we really want to see a 90 year old Indiana Jones come 2020? Give him new roles.   Denis is a mediocre filmmaker coasting on his unabashed pandering to pseuds by employing cinematographers like Roger Deakins and cultivating his visual style to something that can be chalked up as ""the thinking man's Zack Snyder.""

Blade Runner is one of those movies that gets better every time you watch it. Very much looking forward to this movie. Great to see that Deckard has a bigger role than I previously thought. Actually linked to the plot rather than just there to pass the torch to the next generation. Great to hear that iconic music as well. Did they actually get Tangerine Dream and Vangelis together for this, or some of the great modern ambient artists?

It seems that today we are basically sold by super-hyped trailers to go and buy tickets. The majority of Hollywood movies seem to lack some deeper meaning, some message. Everything is just plain and visually beautiful.  The original Blade Runner was not only revolutionary for its visuals at the time, but more important, it was a philosophical movie. It was a movie that asked some existential questions.  And, the ending of the original was great because it left us with all these unanswered questions that every individual may direct and answer in its own way.  It left the possibility of discussion. Having the questions answered in the sequel leave us with nothing, it simplifies the whole concept of the primal idea of the Blade Runner story and universe. The other thing that doesn‚Äôt work for me, is casting big Hollywood names in a movie that is under so much pressure to bring something new. Casting Gosling was wrong, it just seems like this is not only a sequel to Blade Runner, but also to Drive and Only God Forgives. I think that they should have brought an unknown name to play the main character.",0,0,Paula,gCcx85zbxz4,0.13926705478429616,2017-05-08 21:49:30,True,True

You've got a new bionic liver from a Japanese megacorporation but you've still got to pay the rent and feed your drug habit. There are also unsettling implications about the diminishing 'value' of a living person in a world of overwhelming scale and technological sophistication.

The personnel is top notch - people who know what they're doing.  Just because Ryan Gosling is frothed over by many women doesn't discredit him as a 'cheap' actor.  When directed right, he's a great actor, like in Drive and The Place Beyond The Pines.  I'm usually very skeptical of sequels of course, but that's because the intention is always purely to cash in.

2017-05-09T02:36:05,"I hope they stick with the film noir style of the first. The foundation of the original Blade Runner was, first and foremost, a noir detective story. It was all about a cop tracking down and ""retiring"" replicants.   The cyberpunk aesthetic and the ""what does it mean to be human"" message that came from it were a result of the writer and director's vision for this detective story (Ridley Scott said it himself that he was so inspired by the noir films of the 40s and 50s that he wanted Ford's character to also wear a fedora along with the trenchcoat, but ultimately decided against it since it would end up looking too similar to another one of Ford's projects during that time: Indian Jones).   I believe that in order for this film to be great, it needs to remember that the story has old film noir, detective story roots. If it focuses too much on the extras (like aesthetics for example) then I fear it will not capture the essence of the original, and what made it great. If that occurs, then this movie will just end up in the ""not-as-good-as-the-original"" pile, and will quickly be forgotten.

He wants to ask Deckard how he fixed the ''4 years protocol'' (because Deckard obviously live now like a human, and got old because of Methuselah Syndrome). This is what the replicants creator (Leto) means when he talks about the ""key for their survival"". Because if the replicants can fix the protocol, humans cannot control them anymore: they surpassed their creator.  My other theory is even more crazy: Deckard discovered some way to make a children with a replicant woman (Rachel). But she probably died in the process and the baby is Ryan Gosling character. Think about it: 30 years passed since Deckard ran away with Rachel, right? So... In this movie, Gosling seems to be around 30 years old.

They're more action packed than their originals and have a whole different tone in the films. Some fans would even say these films are better than the first.

Movies like this aren't made to be good - they're made to be passable while raking in millions of dollars. They count on (and rightly so) the short memories of people (weren't you all jumping up and down at the last Superman trailer?) and they do well, and Hollywood bangs out more and more and more. I'm sure this will look aesthetically blockbusterish and loads of people will see it and then X-Men 12 will bring out a new trailer a month later and we'll all forget this one and jump up and down and it will begin all over again.

We find out that the Blade Runner's were always Replicants. He searches out Rick Deckerd because he was a Replicant that somehow figured out how not to die.  Why do I believe that? In 2007's making of the Final Cut Documentary for the 25th anniversary release, Ridley Scott said ""Deckerd IS a Replicant"". I highly doubt he would allow the writers to change that fact in his mind.  So Deckerd has survived after all these years and Gosling needs to figure out how ""to survive"".

2017-05-09T05:59:14,"Rather impressed with the trailer.  Cinematography is top notch, Gosling brings along his delectable noire persona, Joi is beguiling and deceptively innocent while Ford resurrects the cut and dry Deckard of lore (an early model with rudimentary emotional buffers).  Leto is trying too hard as usual and channels the Joker in his Happy Birthday comment (tone it down about 70%) while Leto's assistant appears wooden, from her inelegant walk cycles to her pretend stare.  The new Spinner is a clumsy design compared to the original and reminds one more of a failed electric car startup.  I do like that they at least threw in an ode to a Syd Mead conveyance at 1:52.  They also resurrected the original farm scene with Bautista (good casting) - I personally liked the off world intro better.  As an aside, it would have been a much more interesting dynamic if Bautista played Leto's role.  Surprised Ridley is involved with Yorkin again considering Yorkin never did understand nor admire or respect the original.  Overjoyed that Fancher finally gets his much deserved turn at the helm.  Ridley's crude handling of Alien Covenant left me a bit in shock but his selection of Villeneuve seems to be on point.

The whole thing has really solid theme at it's core. And that theme of coarse is minimizing Jared Leto's role in the film. From the visual of a limp lifeless body spilling onto the ground during Leto's first voice over to give us a nice visual of his dead pan acting. Then the studios all flash their logos as if ashamed to be associated.   The next time Leto damns this movie with his voice over we are treated to shot of some dirt being brushed aside, which can only be a metaphor for where they found the script. Finally punctuating Leto's horrid voice over with two loud pistol shots probably an Easter egg to the two writers Hampton Fancher and Michael Green committing suicide after turning in the script.

Cinematography is top notch, Gosling brings along his delectable noire persona, Joi is beguiling and deceptively innocent while Ford resurrects the cut and dry Deckard of lore (an early model with rudimentary emotional buffers).  Leto is trying too hard as usual and channels the Joker in his Happy Birthday comment (tone it down about 70%) while Leto's assistant appears wooden, from her inelegant walk cycles to her pretend stare.  The new Spinner is a clumsy design compared to the original and reminds one more of a failed electric car startup.  I do like that they at least threw in an ode to a Syd Mead conveyance at 1:52.  They also resurrected the original farm scene with Bautista (good casting) - I personally liked the off world intro better.  As an aside, it would have been a much more interesting dynamic if Bautista played Leto's role.  Surprised Ridley is involved with Yorkin again considering Yorkin never did understand nor admire or respect the original.  Overjoyed that Fancher finally gets his much deserved turn at the helm.  Ridley's crude handling of Alien Covenant left me a bit in shock but his selection of Villeneuve seems to be on point.

2017-05-10T19:49:22,"I read the novel before I saw Blade Runner way back when and although the movie was incredible I remember leaving the cinema thinking, 'the book was better'. From what I can see of this trailer, this new version goes even further away from what made the novel so impactful.  The novel presents a shabby, diseased world suffering the effects of a kind of low-exchange nuclear war where so many humans are now genetically damaged and most animals are extinct. Not some dark, gleaming megalopolis. In the novel the replicants are androids. Soulless versions of living creatures. Their superiority is physical and mental but not spiritual. The central premise of the novel is that living things have, to various degrees, empathy. And that living things need other living things around them to excite empathy and to keep the desire to live going. The replicants are attempting to replace humans and might succeed. But humans have been drawn to a new religion called Mercerism that involves entering an empathetic vision world with the help of an electronic device. Something no replicant can participate in. It was all so much more subtle and tragic than the movie. And this trailer shows the unfortunately lifeless effect that CGI can produce and from what I can see, presents a vision of a dystopia not much different than any one of the others in movies made  in the last 15 years.  And if it is about Harrison Ford having a half-human, half-replicant son, well, thanks, I already saw 'The Force Awakens'.",0,0,Cerberus,gCcx85zbxz4,0.044259906759906736,2017-05-10 19:49:22,True,True

I have 4 and 1/2 kids to feed and ive been posted on bus stops and street corners tryna sell sheets of paper with my soundcloud link on em, but all that resulted of that was a crackhead stealing the box i was holding all the papers in. pls se√±or sharpie. this is the last letter i will write and if my 1/2 kid dies its on u. <3 ur vids btw my neighbor watches u all the time, and i just watch along while im peeping thru their window while they're undressing.   gimme a chance : https://soundcloud.com/peterothony/no-no-hennessy",0,0,Thon Makuach,gCcx85zbxz4,0.2037037037037037,2017-05-11 03:02:54,True,True

And this trailer kinda does the same thing, they're sorta making it out to be this action film, which is dumb cause I'd rather make a trailer that fits the movie, even if it doesn't appeal to the general audiences. That way it attracts the people who actually want to see the movie instead of tricking people who came to see explosions but I guess that wouldn't make them enough money.

2017-05-11T13:02:48,"Plot  Spoiler warning:¬†Plot or ending details follow.  Shortly after his activation,¬†David 8¬†is interviewed by Sir¬†Peter Weyland¬†in a palatial lakeside apartment, and David expresses his confusion at having to serve humans, despite being immortal and, in his eyes, superior. Many years later, the colony spaceship¬†USCSS¬†Covenant¬†is en route to the planet Origae-6, carrying over 2,000 colonists in¬†hypersleep. Still more than seven years from its destination, the vessel is struck by the shockwave from a nearby stellar ignition, causing major damage and starting several fires on board. In response to the crisis, the ship's crew are awoken from hypersleep, although Captain¬†Branson¬†is incinerated inside his cryotube when it fails to open. The surviving crew manage to bring the disaster under control, although 47 colonists are lost alongside their captain.  The¬†Covenant's first officer, the highly religious¬†Chris Oram, assumes command of the mission. While undertaking a spacewalk to conduct exterior repairs, pilot¬†Tennessee¬†picks up a fragmented, distorted transmission via his suit's communications systems. When the message is analyzed on board, the crew are able to discern an unidentified human humming a classic rock song within the image. When they trace the transmission to its source, they find it originated from a nearby planet perfect for human habitation, better even than the predictions for Origae-6. Presented with a seemingly perfect home just a few weeks away and with none of the crew wanting to re-enter hypersleep after witnessing Branson's fate, Oram elects to investigate. Branson's wife¬†Daniels¬†officially protests but is overruled.  Upon reaching the uncharted world, Tennessee,¬†Ricks¬†and¬†Upworth¬†remain aboard the¬†Covenant¬†in orbit while the rest of the crew heads to the surface in a dropship to explore. They discover a verdant world ripe in vegetation but mysteriously devoid of animal life. As they explore, one of the security team,¬†Ledward, disturbs some small pods, causing several airborne particles to enter his ear unnoticed. Further searching leads the ground team to a crashed¬†EngineerJuggernaut, inside which they find a¬†dog tag¬†belonging to a ""Dr.¬†E. Shaw"", as well as the source of the transmission they received. The expedition is cut short when Ledward becomes rapidly and violently ill.¬†Karine¬†rushes him back to the dropship, whereupon a¬†Neomorph¬†erupts from his back before attacking and killing Karine. In a desperate attempt to kill the creature, dropship pilot¬†Faris¬†accidentally shoots several flammable tanks aboard the ship, causing an explosion that kills her and destroys the craft; the Neomorph escapes. Outside,¬†Hallett¬†is killed birthing a second Neomorph from his mouth, having also been infected by the pods.  The Neomorphs, already grown larger, soon return to attack the crew on the ground. The armed security team manage to kill one of the creatures, while the second is scared away by a mysterious hooded figure. Unable to contact the¬†Covenant¬†due to ionic interference and with the ship unable to breach the planet's powerful atmospheric storms anyway, the crew follow the mysterious figure. He leads them to a nearby ruined city, strewn with the bodies of dead Engineers. Upon reaching a vast temple at its center, the figure reveals himself to be David, survivor of the¬†USCSS¬†Prometheus. He explains that he and Shaw came to the planet ten years previously aboard the Juggernaut; however, the ship's cargo of weaponized¬†black liquid¬†accidentally deployed over the city when they arrived, annihilating its populace and contaminating the planet. The Juggernaut then crashed, killing Shaw and leaving David alone.  David and the¬†Covenant's own¬†android,¬†Walter, a later version of the same model, spend time bonding in the temple. However, David soon becomes disappointed in his successor's lack of capacity for emotion and higher thought ‚Äî aspects of his own design deemed dangerous and subsequently removed ‚Äî and kills him. Meanwhile, the surviving Neomorph, now fully-grown, infiltrates the temple and kills¬†Rosenthal. David discovers the creature feeding on her corpse and seems to communicate peacefully with it, but Oram bursts in and shoots the Neomorph dead, enraging David. When Oram threatens him, demanding to know the truth about his actions on the planet, David leads him to a laboratory, where he presents his efforts to genetically engineer a superior lifeform from the creatures spawned by the black liquid. He leads Oram onward into a chamber in the lower levels of the temple, where several¬†Eggs¬†of his creation reside. One of the Eggs promptly opens and Oram is subdued by the¬†Facehugger¬†that emerges.  David waits and watches as Oram is later killed by the¬†Chestburster¬†it lays within him. When the remaining security officers go to investigate, Sergeant¬†Lope¬†is also attacked by a Facehugger, although he is saved when¬†Ankor¬†cuts it off of him, badly burning Lope's face in the process. Ankor is then killed by the fully grown Alien while Lope flees. Elsewhere in the temple, Daniels confronts David, correctly guessing that Shaw did not perish in the crash. David confirms that he killed Shaw during his experiments before attacking Daniels. She is saved by Walter, who, as a more advanced synthetic than David, is able to self-repair. The two androids engage in a brutal duel as Daniels flees. She and Lope manage to contact the¬†Covenant¬†and Tennessee launches a rescue in the ship's cargo transporter sled. Daniels, Lope and Walter make it aboard the small ship, although they are pursued by the Alien. Daniels battles the creature aboard the flying craft, finally crushing it in the vessel's remote crane.  Upon returning to the¬†Covenant, the survivors prepare to re-enter hypersleep. However, Daniels and Tennessee discover Lope has been killed by a Chestburster. The Alien quickly slaughters Ricks and Upworth as they shower, but Daniels and Tennessee manage to corner the creature in the ship's terraforming equipment bay, finally succeeding in ejecting it into space. As they return to hypersleep, Daniels realises too late that it is not Walter who is aboard the ship with her ‚Äî it is David. She cries out in vain as he activates her hypersleep pod. Now alone aboard the vessel, David enters the hypersleep bay full of colonists, looking upon the hundreds of bodies in stasis, before regurgitating several small Facehugger embryos and placing them into storage.",0,0,Guy Man,gCcx85zbxz4,0.006617647058823529,2017-05-11 13:02:48,True,True

If a ""Blade Runner"" is a replicant, than it could easily sense other replicants, within a proximity area, despite being informed about them beforehand? Like a sixth sense. Another meaning is to focus on tracking a replicant despite the distraction of modern technology around them. I think another would be escaping other blade runners ( by being chased by one as a replicant), blending in with the rest of the crowd apparently  unoticeable to everyone else around them. I hope Ryan Gosling can top Harrison Ford's performance in the original. Tough act to follow.

Hollywood just want to make money and theaters just want you to stuff your face with corn.  CGI, lame dialogues, explosions, and no plot at all. Don't expect there to be any amazing memes or underlying philosophy.  That went out a long time ago.  This rehash is a cheap ripoff, where the producers don't even care about the material, and fanboys waste their time trying to hold onto their childhood in a cheap ripoff and reboot studio system that dumbs down everything for a foreign audience that didn't understand what the first movie was even about, cause that was American.

""There is an order to things... that's what we do here..."" the writing and acting sounds so over-dramatized - I just don't like it. Assuming she's a law enforcement character (could be wrong), compare her dialogue and tone with Byrant's when he brings Deckard in; Byrant sounds natural, like a guy who works a job, has bills to pay, and isn't really thinking of all this high idea stuff but is just trying to get his job done (it's even better in the book). This is a complaint I have about more than just this new BR but more less about new movies in general. Everything is so big in scale, over-dramatized, and ultimately dumbed down. ""The key to the future..."" What? In the book the androids and technological advances aren't being made for such lofty ideas; they're being produced for more realistic purposes like making a profit or bringing pleasure. It's just like what happened with both Jurassic World and the new Star Trek films.  And yes I realize that this could just be the trailer, but I'm not going to get my hopes up. I'm honestly not a big fan of the original film, but I do respect it on a number levels. This new film looks like a - slightly drier than most - new movie with Blade Runner's skin. Honestly if you want to get the best experience with this world than read the novel by Philip K. Dick. I'm reading it right now, and I absolutely love it.

Replicants only have a four-year lifespan, so the pressure to manufacture a great number of them must be immense. It's too much. Hence his statement that he ""can only make so many.""  At 1:32 we hear about something being ""finally unearthed."" Wallace then sends a female operative to ""bring it to me"" -- presumably the secret that has been unearthed. Is it possible that what Wallace is hunting for is the secret to creating replicants with longer lifespans?  If that is true, then perhaps Deckard is a replicant after all -- but one of the ""special"" replicants who have lifespans longer than just four years.

2017-06-20T18:10:18,"If Harrison Ford wasn't in this movie then I think I'd be more excited for it than I am. Not that I don't rate him as an actor, I really do, but it ruins the entire point of the original Blade Runner. The whole point of that movie was to examine the meaning of being human and humanity itself through the use of existentialism, and letting the viewer determine what and who Deckard actually  is.   Casting him in a Blade Runner movie 30 years after the original was set ruins the ambiguity of the whole movie and kind of diminishes the point of it, because it sort of confirms he isn't a replicant, despite the original strongly hinting that he was a replicant. Even Ridley Scott claimed he was. Yes, the book was written with Deckard as a human, but the movie, like Fight Club, is its own piece of media, and is so highly acclaimed because of the themes it explores.   Unless the movie comes up with a really clever, and I mean really clever, way of explaining things to do with Deckard, then it will sort of ruin the legacy of the original. With this in mind, the cinematography looks fantastic and the casting choice also looks really promising. I like the kind of neo-noir feel to it that the original also had, so in that respect it does look good, it's just how they handle the story and characters that makes me slightly apprehensive.",7,0,DoxaGnosis,gCcx85zbxz4,0.235625,2017-06-20 18:10:18,True,True

Just look at it - It's got all the hallmarks of cheap imitation, meant as a commercial cash grab. Full of fake CGI and shallow characters. Too fast, too overwhelming, too forced, too many explosions, not enough love or personality to it.  Blade Runner was an Original that cannot be replicated (intended) - A saudade meditation and study in cyberpunk atmosphere lovingly crafted through deliberate slow pacing, careful visual design (Syd Meade), pain-staking perspective shots, old-school special effects, and analog synth-wave meant to mimic orchestral movements, done by a master (Vangelis). It created a sense of beautiful loneliness, isolation, and melancholy, of a living breathing futuristic city. You could smell the rain and neon in every scene. It created an emotional depth greater than the sum of its production parts.  Moreover, the actors were participants who spoke little, and their dialogue left space to breathe in between sentences, allowing the viewer to soak up each scene. The underlying theme was they were dealing with an existential crisis that was bigger than themselves - there was no-one to blame, no real enemy - almost a tragedy of sorts. And yet they could  have been anyone on the street - you or me.   I'll leave you with this - to ""get"" what Blade Runner is all about, what I'm talking about here - One only needs listen to Vangelis' Blade Runner Blues, while keeping the spectacular visuals in mind. It is truly one of a kind Sci-Fi Noir movie that was inspired by the culture and technology of decade it lived in (1980s), and its vision of the future still echoes with us today.

I loved the music, the futuristic sci-fi colors and atmosphere, and the actors. I saw Denis' name came up as director and Ridley Scott as exec producer, and I was instantly excited because I knew that from these 2 guys' amazing works in the past, this will automatically be amazing. Yet all I knew about blade runner was that Ridley Scott made the original with Harrison in the 80s, and it had gotten some of the best reviews I've ever seen, from both critics and fans. Last night I saw the original's final cut remastered, went back to this trailer, and NOW I'm officially excited. If you're new to Blade Runner, what hypes this movie up for fans is the theme music, the part where Ryan gosling wants to ask Harrison some questions, and the shiny eyes of some characters that Jared Leto has. If you haven't seen the original Blade Runner, DEFINITELY see it! You'll get what's going on right away, and you'll be just as hyped. Great cast and team putting this together also.

I will expect this from blade runner 2 aswell. Because I watched the first part and its deleted scene compilation more than 20 times, listens to the soundtrack for 10 years now and red the book 5 times. And Harrison Ford is not thankful for being such an Icon he is with Solo or Deckard so fuck him, should go into retirement stupid fuck. Jared Leto sometimes he is very good like in Requiem for an overrated Film or Dallas Buyers Club (he was actually pretty good in it). But then he sucked in Suicide Overhyped Squad and raped the figure of Joker. Heath Ledger was pretty good but not brillant like Jack Nicholson were. And so we will see next week what will happen!

2017-10-06T11:27:36,"Interestingly enough Jared Leto's character is wrong, most civilizations were built not with slaves, but paid workers. Sure there was slave labor, but many of the major cities we know of today started off as forts, built so the people who lived nearby could go there if they were in danger. For example, many of the Celtic/Gaulic peoples (Gauls were Celts, not all Celts were Gauls) utilized indentured servants. This was a common system all over the world, until Caesar committed genocide against the Gauls...the Romans decided slaves were property. Now that doesn't mean Roman slaves were never freed, many slaves became powerful and wealthy during and after their freedom.¬†  Now yes, the Russian serfs were slaves, but they didn't really build civilization, mainly they farmed for a wealthy noble. What really changed Russia was Peter the Great, with his love for western style sailing, and really everything Western Europe...which he then forced westernization on Russia..",0,0,Mingo La Flare,gCcx85zbxz4,0.21319444444444446,2017-10-06 11:27:36,False,True

I mean, it has some very obvious fan service introduced indecently early (in a unlikely scene given the adversary). But it doesn't have the totally neo-noir feel throughout of the original,  or the spellbinding lines, or the showing of industrial imagery always with a decaying mystery to them, rather than a cathedral-like awe of them. It could have used Ridley Scott's touch in some of the places where it looks just like any sci-fi film. The question of what is a real relationship, the depressing idea of could an artificial relationship be the most moving one that someone have, is the most interesting in the movie and that largely happens when Ana Da Armas is on screen in her various scenes.",0,0,Paul Wilde,gCcx85zbxz4,0.06729910714285714,2017-10-06 17:49:05,False,True

Being genuine, it was the most boring piece of well funded shit I've ever seen in my entire life. It only begins to get good in the last quarter and even then it's just not very entertaining.  I had seen this with my family and I thought it was just me who found it underwhelming; turns out they were pretty disappointed too.  I acknowledge that like 99% percent of people in the comments are saying stuff like ""omg! This is the best movie I've ever seen"" and that they think that it's amazing and what not, but this is just my honest opinion: It seriously lacks in action, it's over complicated (at least for people who hadn't seen the first movie) and it's waaay to slow paced.  This is a movie for those who enjoy it's lore, but if you don't understand it/don't give a shit about the over complicated lore, then you'll be sat bored af in the cinema for two and a half hours.

The images are formidable footprints of lyricism, morbid fairy tales, very contemporary. The shots are amazingly stunning surprising with colors whose tones are reversed the warm colors are icy and vice versa. but depressed at wish, with a Ryan Gosling, marble, a Harrisson Ford that appears much too late in the film, and a deafening music that terrorizes ... It is a dystopia that could have been very successful because Villeuneuve addresses the dear themes to humanity, who is it? What is man's own? Is it to have memories? Is it the fact of having a soul? Can it happen again? it is approached sometimes in a subtle way sometimes not ... The film is too long, too contemplative, without real scenes of actions and when they exist they too are too long without punch. Of course, we have the right to a love scene mi real mi virtual , where one wonders where reality begins, hence the questions of memories, real or implanted memories? Villeuneuve sees the future with spleen and melancholy, it is certainly a choice and if the first opus of Blade Runner could look sad, there was a kind of underlying hope ... Here it is mortifer ..

2017-10-09T13:55:01,"This movie had big shoes to fill and man does it fill them. Blade runner 2049 is fascinating, brilliant , intelligent , insightful, gripping and smart piece of filmmaking. You can clearly observe and see how this is a work of an artist who respects the craft and with each movie tries to make a name for himself. This movie works on so many levels starring from stellar performances , great script , interesting and fleshed out characters , intriguing story which by the way plays out as detective investigation for the most of the film, mind-blowing direction and cinematography combined with excellent production values and eerie compositions. I also enjoyed  reversed psychological approach this movie makes with making its protagonist replicant in search for his possible human heritage while the original had human doubting if he is replicant. Great thing about it and not everyone can achieve that is how you get reasoning behind every character no matter if they are good or bad and you understand their actions so they don't end up being generic cartoon characters like in some sci fi films.  2049 is everything modern sci fi needs, it has its own identity and for my money it gets perfect 5 out of 5.",0,0,M Family,gCcx85zbxz4,0.3179761904761904,2017-10-09 13:55:01,False,True

Second note  - I never bought into action if the story was lacklustre - very much like the transformers franchise - which is a pile of shit and highly overrated in my opinion.  I never expected much action from 2049 - if any.  With that said - this movie bored me to death and there are plenty others saying the same.  Seriously dragged out. I think the reason people are defending this movie so viciously is because they can easily do it with the backing of the critics. It's apparent that this will be obtain a cult following like the first - but to say that it will be a cult classic?

It was almost 3 hours, which I cannot watch an movie that is so close to that time period. I can watch Forest Gump and Star Wars (since these movies are also 2-3 hours at least). But this movie literally was half of a waste of time. Like there are parts I cannot understand why they need to include in this. *UH I HOPE PEOPLE WHO HATE SPOILERS ARE GONE!* There is this part where this harlot and the main character were going to have sex, and the scene went by so slow, that in the other half of the film it seemed like that happened in another movie. It was so slow that it should have been a two part movie. It was a good movie with a great plot, but I did not like how it was all put into plan. I fell asleep a couple parts of it, to be honest. My dad and I ordered a large popcorn and it was a big container. About 40ish minutes in the movie it was gone. We don't chug down popcorn in movies either (just to let you know that incase you think the reason why the popcorn didn't last long because we choked ourselves with the popcorn xD). But yeah, if you do not like sitting in uncomfortable movie theater chairs (if your near theater didn't upgrade the seats) for 3 hours, then I don't recommend watching this. If you want to watch this when it comes out in dvd, have at it. BTW when I saw this, the theater had the surround sound so loud my entire body was shaking.

In 1982 Ridley Scott and co. imagined a (retro)future unlike any other and made such a monumental film. Over the years we have become so familiar with androids on film and fiction (Although earlier literature existed), that the original Blade Runner will not impress newer film-goers much and convert them. But as a product of its time, everything about the movie was innovative and still holds up very well, down to the effects and score. In comparison a 2017 release of a sequel doesn't have to tackle much in terms of a visual style or substance since they have already been well established. I feel in that sense, we haven't really imagined real sci-fi in years. I enjoyed 2049 since it didn't destroy what the original was or dumb it down with mere action.

Director Denis Villeneuve does a commendable attempt to pay tribute to the first movie, but that's like trying to make Citizen Kane II. Like the original, it's a visually intense movie, but each scene is not a work of art per the original.  The sound track is heavy and disjointed in spots, and spot on in others. Acting across the board is excellent, even if Gosling still not my first choice, he's solid. If this movie falls short anywhere compared to the original, it's in the dialogue. The original had dialogue I still repeat in my head once in a while, whereas this movie, I can't think of a single scene that will stick in my head. The evil genius in this movie is more a side character, unlike Tyrell, who was one of the most compelling characters in the original.   The movie both pays pays homage to the original, with some characters and scenes being very reminiscent to the first, and many original to this film. By this review one might think I didn't enjoy 2049, but that's not the case at all. This is a must see movie for fans of the original if for no other reason you get to immerse yourself in all things Blade Runner for almost three hours. I don't think it really added anything to the story per se, but it's one of the better movies I have seen in some time, and any time a thinking person's sci-fi movie is made, must be applauded.

I hope from now on you learn how to make distinguishable films. 2049 is the perfect example how a movie should be made, no matter its a sequel ..prequel...etc... Look at Blade Runner 2049 again...its eerie environment,its visual,the tone,colors,camera movement,details,lights,shades, narrative...score!!!..EVERYTHING IS PERFECT !! Dystopian to the Core. IT upgraded the first one to a whole new level without losing its magisty. The experience i had while watching this film shall never be forgotten.

U cannot except people who watch transformers and fast and furious to go to the cinema and watch a film of this caliber !!  Hope u guys can have your money back by lauching other films such as IT for example. Only 35 million dollars..and returner more than 600 million ! profit made !! BLADE RUNNER IS THE MOST XPECTACULAR MOVIE of 2017. Forget about Star Wars. This is a kid blockbuster film..nothing more BLADE RUNNER is the kind of film that makes you think,makes you move ahead,makes you go deep inside and provide you with interesting questions about AI, Humanity,real not real and Science. Moral Values...what life really means....What a soul really means.....endless possibilities...zillions of questions...I feel like the movie should never end...always asking for more.!!!

You won't be quoting famous lines from it in years to come.

Unfortunately I have to say this is really one of THE WORST sci-fi movies I watched in years. I dont know but the movie is very boring and without character at all. It seems like Hollywood lost its golden spark of the 80s -- the screenplay and character development were so bad I was literally falling asleep... and what about that overhelming sex theme and nudity present throughout?

2017-10-22T15:22:48,"Scott invented a new type of Movie genre way back in 1982 - Its called INDUSTRIAL SCIENCE FICTION.Since all that time ago he was afraid to continue Bladerunner nevermind announce it being the quiet but very powerful veteran director that he is today.Because of all the harsh criticism and great uncertainty it was recieving back then.It is still considered to be the most powerful cult sci-fi classic of them all.The latest update is 35 years in the making and it's blindlingly powerful. I honestly thought before I saw it that 164 minutes was too long,but now I reckon its not long enough,the movie completely sucks you in like the industrial hoover that it is and by the time you think that it is too long,it takes you up even faster at supersonic speed by way of the quiet but deadly character K in his flying electric vehicle.It just does not let go of you,You are completely immersed and gripped by its shear power of suspense and by the deadliest and darkest of secrets.It is a1000 times darker than the original and you will love every single second of it,you will not want it to end.The soundtrack keeps you watching,keeps you awake and alert if you are tired and sweeps you away into another world.It shows the difference between what is real and what is fake,what is old and what is new.The old bladerunner model meeting the new model,but that does not mean that new is better and old is just old and useless,far from it.The old always have old tricks that the new doesn't know about,I just love the old dog who keeps Deckard company,who just looks so old and puzzled?I have a thing about black dogs? There's a poignant moment in the story near the end when a powerful artificial force rams into an even more powerful and relentless natural force that engulfs it and sweeps in and out,which do you think wins?It is the classic AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE AGAINST AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT.This is a true GIANT OF A SCI-FI MOVIE that is meant for the big screen,it wont be the same watching it on anything smaller.The end of this leaves two wide open doors into a second movie and hopefully a third,a trilogy in the making.Where Rick Deckard finishes what he started all those years ago and leads an Android ( Replicant ) siege war against the humans especially against corporate humans and WINS!Enjoy,enjoy!God bless all,Escapism forever!",0,0,Den,gCcx85zbxz4,0.11098176966711445,2017-10-22 15:22:48,False,True

2017-10-27T22:01:47,"I watched this a couple of weeks back with my dad - I was the only teenage girl in the cinema hall hahah. It is obvious that the sequel is directed toward men (there is a lot of objectifying of women) - and you can also see that they made a huge effort to make this movie work. First of all, the visuals and the atmosphere are amazing, and grab your attention at once. It's like a modernised, more dramatic and sexier version of the original Blade Runner. The acting, the filming techniques and the way the story is built up - brilliant.  However, I found a couple of scenes - like the romantic ones - a little longer and more accentuated than necessary, though the girl Joi might be in the film to make the audience wonder, what really is the difference between real and fake? Are humans really more genuine than replicants? I think the theme was well chosen, and I appreciate that those who shaped this movie really put in a lot of work. For you can see that every detail was thought through.  There are small moments, details and actions that are copied from the original. Probably to make this one resemble and be connected more to the first film, but for me, it seemed rather unoriginal. I am still unsure whether I like the plotline that sets the foundation for the entire movie - I won't spoil anything, but it is sort of based on a cliche idea that ends up not having much impact on the audience (me) when finally revealed. I was disappointed with how the plot developed, and that there many (albeit little) similarities between the 1982 and 2017 films, that only gave me the impression that they were trying to recreate, or repaint, some of the iconic scenes and traits from the original one. These small semblances seemed just a little superficial and cliche. Or maybe I am being too picky. After all, people always gravitate toward romance in films. The cinematography - or whatever you call it, visuals and effects - makes up for some of the cheesiness though. But after the first breathless impression, I was left with many questions. I did read that they planned maybe on making another sequel, and that must be why it ended in a very open way.  Anyway, it is definitely worth watching. You forget the time as you dive deeper into the story - it is beautifully constructed, loads of details that add to the dystopian mood, and it's really intriguing and gives you pieces of information and action at regular intervals, so you never get bored. Do watch Blade Runner 2049! I don't think you'll regret it.",1,0,k,gCcx85zbxz4,0.13375850340136053,2017-10-27 22:01:47,False,True

His journey was a touching recognition of the possibilities that exist, even within his replicant mind, of living an authentic human life ... he was as crucial a participant as Dekard in this film though his memories were contrived, perhaps like Dekard's, if you believe Rick was also a replicant as Ridley Scott has stated. K (Joe) was a far less vindictive,  more self contained,  gentler version of Rutger Hauer's replicant, capable of compassion yet steadfast in his loyalty to perform as required despite his inferior status.  The splendid soundtrack adds to the viewers cerebral expansion in delving into the depth of such subject matter with grains of urgency, vitality, hope and a burning warmth one might find at a Rave.

2018-01-01T07:39:45,"So I saw this movie. I freely admit to being an uber fan of the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù, so much so I become physically ill when I learned of a sequel. Blade Runner, the original, is the greatest movie ever made IMHO. So naturally, I was very very displeased when I saw that Hollywood was going to cash in off the greatness of the original.  This movie, however, stands on its own and Gosling did impress. The underlying story was sublime. Not as profound or well told as the original. But good.  Pros: Gosling impressed The underlying story was worthy Harrison Ford made it happen Anna de Armas... wow... her character was beautiful in every sense Absolutely stunningly beautiful movie to behold. Cinematography was breathtaking   The Bad... Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) absolutely absurd. Mumbled platitudes,  androids get cut up and shot - presumably fir dramatic effect. An entirely pointless character  Luv - although not quite as absurd, a confused and over-wrought bad-guy drama that did not come together   Look, the original was an organic masterpiece. No fake drama or unnecessary platitudes. It was humanity in its very essence. Nothing can compare.  With that in mind, the movie by modern standards is very good. It simply must have the gratuitous nonsensical fight scenes that one must expect from todays action movies, but other that that. 4/5",2,0,PeteSinHouston,gCcx85zbxz4,0.1703603603603603,2018-01-01 07:39:45,False,True

2018-01-02T07:49:52,"The story is rather weak, but overall, Blade Runner 2049 is still high art with marvelous production design and more than a few  emotionally touching scenes included as well.  The first Blade Runner had the same problems (except it didn't have the emotional scenes). The threadbare story was drowned under the weight of the impressive visuals, and didn't really have an impact at all.  The difference between the original and the sequel is that technology has progressed a lot since 1982, so for modern  audiences, the visuals are now impressive enough to make up for the lack of a compelling story. And I'm not saying the original looks bad by today's standards (far from it), but even as I watched it for the first time back in 1985, although I was impressed, it wasn't enough to make me fall in love with the film. It needed something more.  Well, something more is what Blade Runner 2049 offers. It's just a shame that the story still doesn't match the visual beauty. If it did, we'd be talking about arguably one of the greatest films ever made, instead of ""merely"" one of the best sequels of all time. And as it is, I'd actually prefer to watch the film without any of the dialogue. Just music and some of the sound effects would be more than enough to just sit back, chill, and breathe in the atmosphere.  10/10 for production design. 9/10 for acting. 8/10 for music and sound effects. 6/10 for story.  Overall, a strong 8/10 for the whole thing. Which is MUCH better than the original gets from me.",0,0,teppolundgren,gCcx85zbxz4,0.26096296296296295,2018-01-02 07:49:52,False,True

This and its nearly 3 hours runtime which is also too much attention to bear for most nowadays are believed to be some of the major ""problems"" why this movie didn¬¥t do well. We saw the exact same pattern already several times. As soon a movie needs attention beyond 2 hours people minds start to melt. People also become uncomfortable, which is indeed a cinema house problem I¬¥m myself aware of. I am not super excited for going into cinema but just do it occasionally because my girl loves it. I myself love to watch movies at home and are better able to immerse there. Nowadays with streaming services progressing rapidly, perhaps the cinema exclusivity someday will become past, granting movies more freedom without being tied to a ""cinema dogma"" dictating cruical things like length.   However it isn¬¥t the length alone why nowadays complex and intelligent movies often turn out to be dangerous projects. There are many great movie examples that weren¬¥t overly complex but still managed to overtax the crowd or not hit the current ""trend-mindset"", leading to a dimishing success. Consequence of this is that movie makers and investors may hesitate to progress and better stay true to what they are doing best for too many decades: watered down stories (deus ex machina style) that are just good enough to be carrier vehicles for their actors and their action(s) and cliche movie logic ridden black&white or good&bad characters that enable a simpler mind (if a mind is mandatory at all) to settle down and to easier sort things out. Most nowadays feel already offended when entertainment requires more brain power than barebone sustainment would.   If you take a look at those mentioned aspects you should see the vicious circle here. Stereotypical movies for a stereotypical crowd that only is able to handle stereotypical - which isn¬¥t just true when it comes to movies.

And is it me, or was Deckard tougher in his old age than back during his Blade Runner days? And while it's incredibly dated, there is a fantastic 'point-and-click' video game from the late 90's that ran parallel to Deckard's investigation. Depending upon the player's choices, and responses from NPCs throughout the game, Ray McCoy's fate was one of a possible sixteen endings. In order to avoid legal issues regarding a complicated copyright, Westwood Studios kept the familiar key locations to a minimum and introduced some background trivia of their own to the Blade Runner universe. They were also allowed to ask cast members to voice their characters from the movie. So there was some degree of connection between the movie and 'its interactive sidequal'.

Wallace's character model also ""challenges"" God in its own way (the story of Plagues of Egypt). And I feel that this is too much of repetition.

It's the same plot as the first movie, more or less, with the ""twist"" that instead of hunting down rogue replicants, our Blade Runner is hunting down the child of a replicant.  The bad guy and the good guys have the same motive, so why are they fighting?  Wallace wants replicants that can procreate.  The rogue replicants want to be able to procreate.  Why are they against one another?  Wallace's replicants are supposed to be perfect now.  No running away.  No disobeying.  So why is there even an army of them ready to start YET ANOTHER rebellion.  The movie ends the same as the first one.  Rebellion of replicants about to take place.  Harrison Ford runs off with his family.  The replicant child isn't even a very viable biproduct.  She's fucking bubble girl.  She can't leave her habitat.  If that's what replicant children will turn out to be, they're 100% useless.  Ain't going to the stars with that.  It's visually stunning, but the plot holes are gigantic and the overall story is pointless.  We've seen this movie before.  This is The Force Awakens of Blade Runner movies.

2019-12-01T06:27:22,"As a person that has been watching films for 30+ years, Blade Runner 2049 was by far the greatest film of the past decade, imo.  Nothing compares to it. The studio produced a masterpiece to a sequel that was a masterpiece.  It hasnt been done this well since Empire Strikes Back.  Now as a hardcore MCU fan and I'm still blown away with what they did with IW / Endgame with all the different properties in a mega superhero event with a compelling storyline and a great movie, Blade Runner 2049 tops that for the simple fact at the quality of a film.  Now when I say quality, it is one of the most well rounded films of all time.  The cinematography is off the charts.  The MUSIC by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch - just WOW.  The JOI soundtrack and MESA is absolutely breath taking and yes I put it right there with Vangelis.  The characters.  The plot.  The story.  The acting.  The direction.  Everything in the film just works so perfectly well.  This is the type of film that will get better and better in time and become a cult classic just like the first one.  I'm not surprised the Transformers crowd didn't run to the theaters to watch this one, its not for everyone, but I feel its exactly for someone like me, someone who thinks deeply on things and not just satisfied with surface level bull shit.     I think the most compelling and amazing thing was how different it was from the original, yet so equally impressive.  It still felt like Blade Runner, just from a different angle.  Every single detail was impressive.  The fact its 30 years later and the world changed is exactly what would happen.  There would be world events like the 'Black Out' that took place inbetween films.  Big world changing event stuff like that happens all the time.  Secondly, the character K / JOE.  Ryan Gosling was the most perfect casting choice ever to this character.  But the fact in the beginning , he was an 'average joe' replicant.  And then the movie makes you think he's a 'chosen one' like every other lame franchise.  At the end, you realize that he still was an average joe.  All of us think we are the chosen ones in our own life story, but at the end of the day, we are just ordinary people just trying to get by in life.  And the best thing we can as humans is to help the people and effect the ppl around us.  All he did was to reunite Deckard with his daughter.  He didnt save the world.  He didnt join TEAM WALLACE or TEAM REBEL REPLICANTS or TEAM LAPD.  He simply just did the right thing.  It was the most emotional character decision ever created on screen.   And the relationship between K and JOI.  Holy shit.  This was the most amazing thing I've ever witnessed.  It was amazing because of the dynamics of it.  And also, you could look at that relationship in so many different ways and come up with your own thoughts and interpretations.  Was it a real relationship ?  Was it loving if it was real ?  Was it all fake and pathetic ?  So many aspects to discuss.  But the relationship from my perspective was just so loving, I long to replicate that relationship in my own life with a partner !!!",0,0,Steven Markoll,gCcx85zbxz4,0.2515151515151515,2019-12-01 06:27:22,False,False
