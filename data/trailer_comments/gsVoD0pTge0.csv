2017-02-07T02:41:09,"I have recently seen Manchester by the Sea. I gather it's located in the US state of Massachusetts, which continues the Boston-based films that both Affleck brothers have been involved in. Casey Affleck takes on a responsibility that he is unused to and ill-prepared for: the guardianship of a 16 year-old nephew.  The film portrays a limited man, an inexpressive unsociable blue-collar man who jars with others and tends to erupt into fist fights at bars at the slightest provocation. I tended to dislike this aspect of the character, but Casey Affleck plays the role flawlessly. I like a film of a family crisis where characters' emotions are revealed, where conflict is dealt with an resolved. The fishing boat is a place of nostalgia for the characters. I was confused by a lot of the flashbacks to about 10 years earlier. I was also confused by the seminal 'disaster' incident in the film involving Affleck's carelessness when he went out to buy more beers. Where does that fit in? Some cinema viewers last night were audibly upset, shedding tears, but I felt little empathy for the Affleck character. Is he a schmuck, a misfit, a laudable Joe 6-pack out of his depth or just a brawler with whom we have little feeling for? In my case, he is the last named. Look for a small role for Matthew Broderick, Ferris Bueller himself, looking silver-haired and middle-aged but watchable, as the nephew's mom's new man.",1,0,weskitten,gsVoD0pTge0,0.03856679035250463,2017-02-07 02:41:09,False,True

He's an above average actor, however in this movie, his sad moments scenes he struggles with in a big way. I get it, his character was supposed to be dead inside and it's intention was supposed to be someone who hides their emotions, so I get it, but an actor should be able to obviously hide the verbal emotions, but should give us some sort of emotion that is being held back. He's just flat in the sad scenes. His reaction at the fire scene is pathetic, which btw was before he was dead inside. Couldn't they have done more takes? His best and only scene where he gives any sad emotion is when he runs into his ex wife while he's out walking around. He was good in that scene. Any other scene that should have been sad, felt like nothing. I don't understand how others didn't get the same vibe.
