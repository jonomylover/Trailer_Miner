However, it seems the new angle is he joined because of a lie & that the government/system is continuing to be corrupt & he wants to break it. His motivation now seems to be instead of hitting back at people going after him or looking for answers, he knows the whole system is corrupt no matter who's in charge, even if good people like Landy are there, the corrupt people will just work around her & those like her. This time, he wants more than personal revenge vs Conklin or Vosen or hoping Congressional hearings with Landy with fix it. Bourne seems to be thinking it has to smashed, the entire system.

So all of that internal propulsive mechanism that drives the character is not there, so if there was to be another one then it would have to be a complete reconfiguration, you know, where do you go from there? For me I kind of feel like the story that we set out to tell is has now been told. I love the character, and if Paul Greengrass calls me in ten years and says, 'Now we can do it, because it's been ten years and I have a way to bring him back,' then there's a world in which I can go, 'Yeah, absolutely.'

The directing is also lazy. The special effects are good. Bourne is no longer a meticulous planner, his actions are ridiculously reckless and would make you wonder WTH !!!!! The technology used by the CIA is fantasy technology imagined by the kind of people who don't know anything about technology or even science, you would probably laugh at the programming language used by the CIA in the first few minutes of the movie, and it only gets more ridiculous from there. This movie also serves as a advertising tool for some very wealthy and infamous businesses, and those scenes showing the business names are so painfully long and awkward. The story line also has to serve those special interests.Go see it and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

Almost to the point, I'd watch most films just to see her face on screen, because it has some sort of magical effect. 2. Matt Damon is Matt Damon. He always has the same presence and he's a good actor. 3. There seems to be an acting problem in this. A lot of the actors, even some of the main ones, just kept slipping up on their accents. Almost to the point it's very cringe. Some lines, you'll be like.. HOLD UP.. she/he's gone from French, to British to American all in one dialogue. 4. The writing is not anywhere near as good as the first three, and is let down by some silly plot lines, that if better written and structured, could have saved it a bit.  5. Julia Stiles (Nicky in the films) is useless in this film, so if you're a fan of her or she's a reason why you're going. I wouldn't get your hopes up. Her moments are also made worse by the fact her acting in this is god awful for some reason.  Overall. It has some sense of the trilogy and Matt Damon obviously, and isn't too bad of a film. But don't expect it to be like its predecessors. Good action, unrealistic-stupid-albeit still pretty entertaining hacking scenes, and awful acting in some places - saved by the nostalgia, Alicia and Matt.

Other than some well done action scenes, this was a disappointing addition to the Bourne franchise.

2017-09-09T15:18:35,"The first Bourne movie was actually a TV movie made in 1988 with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith with the title The Bourne Identity. Not many watched this movie at the time but I did and I was blown away with the story and the acting (compared to other 80's TV crime cliches). Then in 2002 they made a remake with Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Wasn't too bad but there was no chemistry between Matt and Franka and Matt just didn't have a face for the character. He looked too young and too boyish. Disappointed but watchable. And then came a disaster sequel and the rest not much better. Two things are bad in all sequels. Story and directing! Story becomes so complicated , so technical and so detailed that before the half time you don't care any more. It is just a moving picture. And then the last nail in the coffin is the moving picture or moving camera or better yet shaking camera. And this is because director of all 3 sequels to Matts' series is Paul Greengrass! It is not only shaking camera but also zoom in and on the top of that cuts. Just take any 15 minutes of the movie and don't watch the movie but just directing and you will see. Totally unnecessary closeups, if action scene you have closeups AND shaking camera but also lots of cuts. When the Supremacy was made that was something new in directing. Like a fresh thing. Like enhancing the action, make it more life like feeling. And much cheaper to make. When you shake the camera in closeup you don't see much and when you do cuts every second you don't really see anything properly. You don't have to care of many expensive details of surrounding for the same scene shot normally from the distance with static camera and cuts are then too obvoius. So when the Ultimatum came out and I saw Pauls' name as a director I was reluctant to watch but I hoped he has probably grown out of this CSC directing (Closeup-Shake_Cut). No. Maybe he has grown out of CSC but then must be the cheap price tag that forced him to stick to CSC. When the Jason came out and I saw Pauls' name again I didn't watch the movie at all. Last night my friend got me a BD disk as a present and it was Jason Bourne. I like Vikander so I tought I will just watch her in the movie but after a few actions scenes I just walked away. It is a shame as Matt now older looks closer to the Bourne character and being beefed up and well trained in combat moves, Bourne franchise could have a watchable future.

I'm sorry it just doesn't tie in with bourne.  ok my next bitch is tommy lee jones.

This is the darkest of the Bourne films, and definitely the most morally ambiguous one yet. Bourne here is no more trying to expose government or find the truth, he's here to kill, to get his revenge for Nicky and his father. And in the end he actually does something he constantly tries to avoid - murders the Asset by hunting him down. There's also an ambiguity in his motives - does he want to go back to work for government, is peace no more a solution for him, is he mentally unable to live normal life?

He looks much different.  I'm only here because the Lord is coming back soon to judge the world. It is not His will that any perish but all repent to receive eternal life. I'm in oneness with His will.   Everyday people die and enter hell, these are your friends and family. You have the voice to change their eternal destination if you follow and obey Jesus Christ until the end, and even unto death. Seek Him with patience and persistence, until you hear His voice, if your willing. Nothing is forced but if your friends and family end up in hell for all eternity, who can you blame? You have the voice to do right but you chose to do wrong.  God gave us freewill, nothing is forced. But for those who are willing, come and join the only kingdom that will last forever, the kingdom of Jesus Christ. All other kingdoms will perish by fire.  2 Peter 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.
