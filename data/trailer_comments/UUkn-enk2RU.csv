2018-05-01T17:35:27,"(Spoilers)        This looks great! But after coming off the gut-puncher of an ending from Infinity War, I'm really hoping this gives us more answers especially as to what Ant-Man and possibly Hawkeye were up to during Thanos's reign of terror. Love how we're going to get more into the quantum verse. However, I'm hoping that doesn't mean this is all going to be solved through time travel. Also, I'm going to predict that at the end of the film both Ant-Man and the Wasp will disappear since it seems to be mostly Avengers who were introduced after the main 6.

2018-05-02T17:28:24,So pumped to see this movie. I think the 80s/90s music gets you into the action and jokes. Love Hope‚Äôs line ‚ÄúIf you two are done comparing sizes‚Äù. The double entendres in that scene make it hilarious. Psyched to see Laurence Fishburn is going to be in a Marvel movie and that they‚Äôre bringing back the heist crew and Hank Pym. Interested to learn more about the villain in this one too. Can‚Äôt wait to go see this movie this summer.,0,0,Chibihalo2,UUkn-enk2RU,0.2642857142857143,2018-05-02 17:28:24,True,True

2018-05-04T05:28:26,"(minor spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War)     My sister & I saw Avengers: Infinity Wars on opening day & it is AWESOME! I'm already predicting how Ant-Man & The Wasp will end. After Ant-Man & The Wasp complete their mission, they celibate at Hank Pym's house. Everything seems ok, but then Hope says ""Guys...something is wrong with me"". Hank says ""Are you ok"", Hank recoils back in shock when he sees her dissolve into nothingness. Before Hank can say anything Scott says ""you're hand"". Hank looks at his dissolving hand, then he dissolves completely. Scott is sitting in shock, he's brought back to reality when his phone rings. He looks at the caller-id, sees its his daughter. Scott says ""Hi Cassie"". Cassie says ""Get over here quick"". Scott says ""What's wrong"". Cassie says ""Mommy disappeared in front of me"". Scott puts 2 seemingly unrelated things together. Scott says ""Stay right there, I'll be there as soon as I can"". Scott races over to where his daughter lives. He sees that many vehicles are not even moving, some have even crashed into something. Scott finally arrives at his ex-wife house. Scott knocks on the door, door gets flung open & Cassie hugs her father. Scott says ""What happened"", Cassie responds ""I don't know. Mommy disappered, its like when you put Alka-Seltzer in water"". Scott picks up Cassie, looks around & says ""What's going on"".

2018-06-29T22:10:08,Once phase 4 ends I will probably be done with the MCU. Kathleen Kennedy seems to be trying to infect the MCU as well.   So that I will not tolerate!! It was a good run however and nothing will ever replace what has been accomplished here.  But if Disney thinks it's PC brainwashing campaign is going to help win new fans. They have seriously underestimated the fan base here.   What fans want are good stories and if they fit into the storyline. Then fine WTF ever but don't be doing it just for the sake of making the entitleists happy.   Otherwise you'll see a repeat of Solo over and over again. Something tells me Disney is not going to have the stomach for those kinds of losses.  So with all do respect let's hope that doesn't happen. Ant-Man was good however no complaints. :),0,0,BlazinNSoul,UUkn-enk2RU,0.28613053613053613,2018-06-29 22:10:08,False,True

WHAT IF when he is in there he runs into one, releases the healing tonic stuff and gets time particles instead. Then falls into one and meets Captain Marvel in her time. (Because her movie takes place in the 1990's.) Not knowing where he is he goes the one person he knows where exactly they are in that time, Foster. He explains what he knows. Foster maybe takes him to Hank idk. They run into Fury and create a Tec that allows Fury to notify Captain Marvel in the past. That would give Captain Marvel the day and time he sent it, then using the time travel particles that Ant-man has, he is able to give a watch to Captain Marvel and they go to help stop Thanos. (Also somewhere in there he is able to use those time particles and programs it into his suit and watches, which he gives to Ironman and Thor (as we see in photos of them on set,).)

2018-07-13T06:14:14,"This movie is for me one of the best MCU movies. It‚Äôs not trying to be anything huge and revolutionary, but it‚Äôs not trying to be a classic hero versus villain story either. This movie is more about many people with different problems intercepting, which turns into conflict or resolution (Ant-Man with house arrest, Ghost with her phasing problem, Hank and Wasps need to rescue Janet, Sonny Birch and his mission to get Quantum tech on the black market and into the future for consumers, etc.). Besides that, the comedy was golden, the action was fun and kinetic, the characters were great (including new additions), and pairing of Ant-Man and the Wasp was just perfect. I guess you can say *it takes two to make a thing go right* indeed. Ghost was one of the most sympathetic yet tragic antagonists of the MCU, who also uses her phasing abilities to make some of the best and most creative scenes. In fact, the only thing that makes her a villain and not an antihero are the desperate measures she will go to to survive. She‚Äôs very complex and tragic, and keeps the streak of great MCU villains going. Also, those end credits scenes were great, and neatly set up Ant-Man in a way for Avengers 4 next year.

2018-09-10T08:16:31,"WARNING this review may contain spoilers read at you're own risk. This is another great addition to the MCU. we now learn in this movie why Ant-Man was not in infinity war and he had a good reason. a lot of people were wondering how this movie was going to fit in and they pulled it off. first off let's talk about the movie, this movie is fantastic but I think the first one was a little bit better. Let's Talk about Ghost. Was she really a bad guy? some would say yes because of the motives and lengths she would have taken to complete that motive, like killing and kidnapping(Don't want to give too much away) would make her a villain. but some would say no because she had a good reason. I would say yes. yes to the motive and lengths that she would have taken to accomplish it but all in all, she was a villain, but if it wasn't for her reason or extreme motives and lengths then she would not be a villain. to be honest I thought she sucked as a bad guy now that I think of it she was a pretty good villain. Not every good villain has to take over the world. but killing someone to save your own life is pretty villainous. like I said I don't want to give away too much let's just say that she was going to sacrifice a character to save her self that hank just found out was still alive and is in the quantum realm, that's all I'm going to say. so yeah Ghost is a good villain. the acting, story and special effects are great in this movie all the actors did a great job in this film like always and it was well directed. the movie is also really funny there is this one scene where Ant-Man's suite starts glitching out in a school and it is hilarious. they also introduce Goliath in this movie which is cool but he plays only as his regular self as bill foster. the end credit scene is awesome. but I wonder where they are going with it. I have to talk about it so if you don't want to know quit reading. so the end credit scene shows that Scott is in the quantum realm getting stuff to help ghost to stabilize herself this is after they save Janet and Janet stabilizes ghost aka Ava, but when Scott goes into the quantum realm Janet, hope and hank dust away from when Thanos destroyed the gauntlet. so now Scott is stuck in the quantum realm he had to have someone help him get out. I was like wow what just happened. so now we know how this movie ties in. I really enjoyed this movie and I know you will too. this movie is cinematastic. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do one more thing Evangeline Lilly was an amazing Wasp she did such a great job at the character and I hope to see her in more MCU you just can‚Äôt bring in a bad ass character like that then dust her away. But I'm glad that Wasp made it to the big screen I'm pretty sure she will be back cause I'm pretty sure Ant-Man is going to have a third movie, oh and i forgot about this second bad guy that wasp has a dealing with he is a black market gangster named Sonny Burch which just gets in the way he also wants the lab. his character is not bad, but comical and Micheal Pena is hilarious as ever. rating 5/5",1,0,David Smith,UUkn-enk2RU,0.2864557226399332,2018-09-10 08:16:31,False,True
