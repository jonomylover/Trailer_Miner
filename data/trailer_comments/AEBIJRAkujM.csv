2017-06-07T18:41:31,"Elements of Iran Contra get the big screen treatment.  Seal was no joke.  He was a major, major supplier, courier if you will, of coke that was processed into crack.  Seal was in the right place at the right time, same with Freeway Ricky Ross.  They both made serious money off the crack trade that was just starting to get rolling in the early 1980s in major cities across the country that were beginning to feel the sting of deindustrialization and the impending low-wage, underemployment economy. Mena Arkansas was a frequent drug drop site, I presume the movie will touch on this.  The drugs, tons of cash and gun running that Seal and some others (there were others) were hauling was basically controlled by elements of the CIA to get around the Boland Amendment.  During the 1970s and early 1980s indigenous-populist movements in Central America were gaining power by serving the people.  For decades El Salvador and Nicaragua were lorded over by corrupt and violent kleptocrats.  By the late 1970s populist movements fighting for economic justice were starting to gain ground.  The Washington imperialists feared these democratic movements like the plague, see, the kleptocrats were always under Washington's thumb; opening their countires up to corporate capitalist penetration.  Since these long over due populist movements sent such fear into the ruling class in Washington, Ollie and the boys along with covert CIA operatives started running the guns to mercenaries to fight the guerrillas who were a part of the populist movements.  Anytime the powers that be need to wage a clandestine war (work around the Boland Amendment) they of course need to drum up cash, lots of cash.  That's where Seal and the boyz came in.  I'll be very interested to see how candid this movie is about the role of the national security state imperialists in Washington, sometimes now referred to as the ""Deep State.""  For further reading on what I've quickly sketched out above: see the works by Gary Webb, Nicholas Shou, Robert Parry, and Cockburn and St. Clair's book 'Whiteout'.  For a deeper understanding of the progressive movements in Central America in the 1970s and early '80s, see the books and articles by James Petras, Michael Parenti and Noam Chomsky.  Also see the dynamite movies ""Salvador"" by Oliver Stone, and the film ""Romero.""",0,0,Drew Hunkins,AEBIJRAkujM,0.01696428571428571,2017-06-07 18:41:31,True,True

2017-07-02T19:42:33,"Elements of Iran Contra get the big screen treatment.    Seal was no joke.  He was a major supplier, courier if you will, of coke that was  processed into crack.  Seal was in the right place at the right time,  same with Freeway Ricky Ross.  They both made serious money off the  crack trade that was just starting to get rolling in the early 1980s in  major cities across the country that were beginning to feel the sting of  deindustrialization and the impending low-wage, underemployment  economy.   Mena Arkansas was a frequent drug drop site, I presume the  movie will touch on this.  The drugs, tons of cash and gun running that  Seal and some others (there were others) were hauling was basically  controlled by elements of the CIA to get around the Boland Amendment.   During the 1970s and early 1980s indigenous-populist movements in  Central America were gaining power by serving the people.  For decades  El Salvador and Nicaragua (and some of the other C. American states) were lorded over by corrupt and violent kleptocrats.  By the mid/late 1970s populist movements fighting for economic justice were starting to gain ground.  The Washington imperialists  feared these democratic movements like the plague, see, the kleptocrats  were always under Washington's thumb; opening their states up to  corporate capitalist penetration.  Since these long over due populist  movements sent such fear into the ruling class in Washington, Ollie and  the boys along with covert CIA operatives started running guns to  mercenaries to fight the guerrillas who were a part of the populist  movements.  The Contras were some of these mercenaries.  They were directly responsible for some of the most heinous torture and murder of innocent civilians that the Western hemisphere has ever witnessed: castrating children in front of their parents, then cutting off heads of parents in front of children, it's all documented and sickening beyond belief.  American tax dollars were indirectly supporting all this and the US coke market was directly involved in it.  Anytime the powers that be need to wage a clandestine war  (work around the Boland Amendment and domestic public opinion) they of course need to drum up cash, lots of cash.  That's where Seal, the coke and the boyz came in.    I'll be very interested to see how candid this movie is about the role of the  national security state imperialists in Washington, sometimes now  referred to as the ""Deep State.""    For further reading on what I've quickly sketched out above: see the works by Gary Webb, Nicholas Shou, Robert Parry, and Cockburn and St. Clair's book 'Whiteout'.  For a  deeper understanding of the progressive movements in Central America in  the 1970s and early '80s, see the books and articles by James Petras,  Michael Parenti and Noam Chomsky.  Also see the dynamite movies  ""Salvador"" by Oliver Stone, and the film ""Romero.""",0,0,Drew Hunkins,AEBIJRAkujM,0.016376306620209054,2017-07-02 19:42:33,True,True

Their story of valor, love of their country, and courage will be told. Their story will come to light when enough people, not media outlets or university text books stop spewing their attempt at whitewashing history or plain lies. “Give light, and the darkness will disappear of itself” Desiderius Erasmus.   The criminals were all along on the side of those who the “freedom fighters or contras were fighting against.

It is imperative that anyone who watches this movie also watches the video below. But you can also find a lot of material that social media and others have attempted to bury out.  I'm most gracious to this video, because at minute 17+ he says how they stirred up the confusion between arms supplied to leftist rebels and that were not for the contras. Something the world needs to know.  https://youtu.be/gLWMnH31D-Y  American Made is as far from the truth as it gets, even if its premise is correct in that it is as American made as they come (American government establishment - G. Bush senior, one of those who played double face to Ronald Reagan) part of the deep state!

Experience they gained from Hitler, Stalin, Castro, and yes, WWII's FDR and others.   In the white-water Senate hearings, see how at around minute 30 Dan Lasater is splitting hairs on his guilty conviction for conspiracy to distribute narcotics. (Interesting factoid, how many years did he serve in jail and who gave him a pardon?  you couldn’t make this shit up) … Lasater’s hair splitting “I’m not…Sounds familiar? ""Bengasi, I didn't delete emails were not criminal, they were 'extremely careless’, I whipped clean the server with a cloth, and the best from these cute couple, overload, ""I did not have sex with that woman"".   One day the world will know that the peasants ""contras"" were not the drug smugglers, that they recovered mostly all their weapons from Sandinista bases they overran/defeated in battles, and from a large infusion from our world champion Alexis Arguello, who gave them over 30 million dollars to fight against all the international criminals who were behind the Sandinistas at the time. Alexi's first shipments arrived in and around 1982, right around his first fight with Aaron Pryor...in which I was almost expelled from the boarding school I was attending at the time, near Matagalpa, Nicaragua, for been out of the campus, outside the holly Shabbat's and school’s rules for decorum, watching the fight. :-)  Another important factoid is the fact that during the so called ""Contra drug smuggling hearings that Congress, in the House (now disgraced and retired congressman Charles Rangel, and in the Senate then Sen. John Kerry) were the ultimate diversioneers, in order to cover their tracks, and masters of the now we know to be corrupt, criminal I'd say, FBI, CIA, and the minions who almost brought down President Reagan, all on trumped up charges that are far from the truth.

This movie is based on a man named Barry Seal who mix up with the cartel and can't get out of it. Tom Cruise did an excellent job at portraying this character from what I hear and know about the real Barry Seal. This movie is action packed but also is a drama. This is one of Tom's finest work. The acting is great, the story is great, directing is great and action is great.

As for the movie, its fairly forgettable...it basically seems inspired by ,catch me if you can, and the wolf of wall street. BOTH dicaprio movies.    Tom Cruise is simply not convincing as a TEXAN...he just cant stop his own CRUISENESS, but i will say THIS...its not a BAD movie to watch...its basically, light inoffensive entertainment, and Most of the scene's involving tom flying the plane, are Superb, because they are legitimate, and it shows......and, as i later learned, this was due to him performing all of the flying and stunts himself, which is VERY impressive.

I watched it today and thoroughly enjoyed it as a no-strings-attached movie.  It hardly even goes two minutes without some sort of sweet action scene, and there are ZERO of those long and boring ""look how cool my acting skills are, here's seven minutes of random emotion"" scenes; it's basically the opposite of Breaking Bad.  But if you know anything about Barry Seal, you should prepare yourself to be severely disappointed with the story line. I recommend it.  Despite its flaws, it's very entertaining.
