2018-02-05T16:42:54,((  ‚úù  )) this is like one of the coolest movies ever that they had done. I love it big time also it's fantastic. And yes I have this on Blu-ray disc as well. Also I tried to Google the peanuts. Because I was wondering if there is going to be a part 2 to this movie or not. But so far couldn't find anything on it. Also as big as the peanuts is and as long as they have been out I am surprised that they haven't done an actual tv series for the peanuts yet. In a way I kind of think it be cool for them to do a tv series just maybe I don't know. I will be honest with y'all when I first heard about the peanuts as a movie I did not think it was going to be all that great. However I was wrong and the Peanuts movie came out fantastically amazingly awesome. So anyway I think the TV series that's if they ever did it. I think that would turn out to be fantastically awesome as well.,1,0,shawn eldridge,zQpUQPrAfQM,0.321875,2018-02-05 16:42:54,False,False
