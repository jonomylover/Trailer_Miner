Other people saying that they could've dressed ""the musical way"", again this is not possible, the reason why they are flawlessly dancing is because they actually wearing their own clother and CGI suits or dots (I'm not an expert in this field), anyways if they wore the musical costume ot wouldve been so hard to dance like the way in the trailer, because performing on stage is much different than in a actual movie filming. A movie is something gonna stay forever and will never change while a stage performance is repeating every now and then and can be developed somehow, so please don't hate on it and don't compare it to the ""Sonic"" situation because if you think about it, they aren't even relevant to each other. Ps: I'm still not into Avatar and the way that they looked in the movie and a lot of people when Avatar's trailer was released they were freaking about the way it was done. And now it is one of the most famous movies of all time. Stop hating on art and listen to Jennifer Hudson singing Memory beautifully in that trailer.

2019-11-19T23:01:14,"I think the faces are dramatically improved, and the fur in general, it's just the fundamental premise of blending people and cats that is potential nightmare fuel. I think my #1 technical criticism seems to be related to ambient lighting. 0:27 Cats on Stairs look jarringly plastic. 0:34 That cat is breaking Newtonian Law. If the animation is captured from real wirework with an actor and that's all you have to work with, fine, I can't imagine someone choosing to animate a landing like that but it looks like the cat visibly slows down in the air. The landing also has nearly no momentum but this is a cat so maybe that's an in-universe thing, air manipulation is definitely a problem though. 0:42 Cats standing in town square. Everything looks so soft and blurry I can't quite place the cats as being in that scene, or that scene necessarily existing anywhere but a dream.  0:43 Cat Eating Bone. So it looks like the fat cat is being carried, and other cats are touching it, but there is no effect on the fur. It looks like the other cats are using magnetic repulsion to carry the fat cat.   0:47 Of course criticism is nothing without some positive reinforcement. Lady cat on the bed looks perfect. (Ok as perfect as modern CGI can allow, but this is clearly your best scene). 0:52 More positive, or negative for the CGI guys I guess. It seems like any time you add real physical props onto your actors it makes them 1000% more believable (the bed is effectively clothing for the cats while they're playing on it).   0:55 Cats At The Gate. Ambient lighting gone wrong. The grey cat talking here might be the most ""CGI"" looking thing in the trailer.   1:04 Idris Elba sitting on a statue. The CGI here looks fantastic, and conceptually horrifying. Good job CGI people, shame on whoever thought this movie was a good idea.   1:00 and 1:09 Judy Dench and Ian McKellen. I'm guessing these are your Tier Zero models, they look great, so good in fact that everything else looks bad in comparison. Tell the producers to scrap this movie and wait 10 years so they can do the whole thing at your current Tier Zero. Really, all the acting and propswork is probably as good as you'll ever get it, we just need better computers.   1:29 Bending Cat Ear. Looks terrible. I know, you can't control the actors and changing a limb for even a moment would be obvious. I take pity on whoever was tasked with that ear, but it looks like the entire ear is using muscle all the way to the tip and isn't actually being controlled by the head and face muscles.   Clearly a lot of work went into this and I hope all the artists are happy with their jobs.

2019-11-21T19:55:09,"*Just a comment to hopefully settle your brains on the history of the designs and....interesting movements....*  Well I mean you can't really hate on it that hard... CATS is a really REALLY OLD Broadway play. That's why their movements are so fluid among other things.... Even in the old production this was how the uh...cats were portrayed so I'm not really shocked they look like this. (In all sincerity the graphic design put into their fur and tails is top quality artistically. Whether you like it or not...this is just a fact so props to the artist.) I guess the only reason they didn't just go full anthropomorphic (instead of the neko like form they have in this movie) is because of the play itself to stay true to the age old costume design as well as to preserve each actors appearance. (*Though to make it less awkward I wish they would have just been full on anthropomorphic to look like actual cats standing upright, think of Puss in boots from shrek*)  For a lot of these actors, being able to be in a production of CATS must be a fun dream or experience of theirs. Not for....furry reasons for lack of a better explaining, but because CATS is a very famous play and a lot of Actors and singers come from play orientated backgrounds.  To be real though I was always curious about this story and wondered why it was so popular other then the uh...possible adult content..but growing up I was always told it was a little lewd sooooo I'm kinda 50/50 on this lol.  I really just wanna watch it for the story and world of it cause I want to figure out why people made such a big deal of it...other then the costume design lol.   *Anyway I hope that delivered some insight....I for one am just gonna wait until I can rent it or something to skip parts I might find annoying lol.

The CGI of the human noses, somehow these cats have human hands still.  2. Where is the music to this classic? 3. The scope is all wrong. Sorry, harsh but true. It feels like there is an imbalance that I can't quite put my finger on. Perhaps the music is not grand enough, perhaps the personalities in the trailer appear to be non-existent. But CATS should give you tingles. This does not.  4. I don't see the proportion. The musical made it seem like these were...cats. These characters look like people.  5. Honestly, it's like there was no attention to detail but all attention to the details that no one would pay attention to.  6. Could you please redo this? Please? I think there is all the talent in the world here, this could be good if there is just attention to the right detail.

2019-11-29T15:52:16,How about this you guys I love the play I seen it live. I am not freaked out about the trailer because I enjoy the place so much. It has a really good story line. At one of them is don't judge a book by its cover especially with one character which the other cats actually do in real life when she's actually a very great cat. The cats were never supposed to be just cats they're actually if you look at the play version movie that is actually out and listen to the extras you learn a little bit more about the actual play. The cats has always had a human feature to them that's what the guy who wrote the poems wanted especially when the guys who are doing the play Promise the author that they keep the cats how the author really wants. The movie looks great I'm excited for it to come out. If I was you I will not destroy this movie that's exactly what you guys are doing you're slamming it and say it's scary blah blah blah blah go see it anyways if you don't let the trailer fine but go see it anyways I listen to the trailer but I'll still go see the movie the movie will turn out to be better but if you still don't like it do us all a favor and those who haven't seen the movie just say I don't like it in a story do not ruin the movie for everybody else don't find things too nitpicky on it because they're only your opinion they're the things that you have issues with. Mean people are nitpicking Avengers endgame seriously I like that movie and then Nick picking it to the death and ruin the movie for everybody else just like they're doing with Captain Marvel they nickpick it to death. Press play actually has a lesson to it maybe you guys should learn that lesson because there's a cat that has been judged thoughtfully and once again you judging this movie without because of this trailer but that's bothering to go see it before you pass judgment on this trailer to go see the movie and then make your opinion make your opinion so that it doesn't destroy the film and scare people away.,2,1,Jamie Horne,gNTDoOmc1OQ,0.16732323232323235,2019-11-29 15:52:16,True,True

The dancing and the way they move look almost borderline creepy. Nothing about it seems fluid and it looks more animated than I think they were aiming for.

2019-12-21T22:58:05,"What an experience! Cats overflows with creativity and ardor and spirit and energy that comes from the cast onscreen and the people behind the scenes. The sets are mysteriously beautiful. But I think I was most impressed with the dancing choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler and the dancers especially Francesca Hayward and Les Twins. But IMO all the Jellicle dancers put on an amazing show, so much so that there were moments in the film when I kind of wished director Tom Hooper had followed some of the full-cast dances a bit slower. But then again there is something to be said for Hooper's Infectious whirling effect. The singers are as good as the classic songs. Taylor Swift is a flirtatious Bombalurina who sings the nasty Macavity's (good job, Idris Elba) theme song as well as parts of ""Beautiful Ghosts"" & the full version over the end credits. . Jennifer Hudson's tortured, emotional version of ""Memory"" works wonderfully most of the time, especially at the end. This ""Cats"" casts Victoria in the starring role of an innocent homeless kitten rescued by some of the Jellicle tribe. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll just say Victoria has some adventures as she gets to know individual Jellicles, some more than others. She follows one of Grizabella's ""Memory"" preludes with a sweet and touching version of ""Beautiful Ghosts"". If I try to comment on everyone and everything that makes Cats Cats this would be a very very long review! So just a few more. Jason Derulo is lots of fun as the singing & dancing & catnip-to-kittens Rum Tum Tugger, The comic relief provided by various cast members was uneven, some good, some ""meh"" but these short scenes do make Cats more entertaining and give audience members a chance to catch their collective breath. The most marvelous ""performances by an actor"" were  Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat.  There is something so warm and inviting about Dame Judi's facial expressions; she was covered with just the right amount of digital fur so that the audience could be moved by them. Sir McKellen is a treasure.He plays an old, seen-it-all actor reminiscing  about his long theatrical career with a sense of pride and joy in his craft that is genuinely moving. Thank you, Andrew Lloyd Webber and everyone who brought this feline magical mystery tour to the P.S.
