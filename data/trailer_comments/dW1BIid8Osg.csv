I am a total marvel geek and want to know about anything marvel. Seeing this I am scared. It'll take a lot to even come close to living up to the first one. Baby groot... idk man, he's cute and all but I don't think it's the right path. At the end of the movie I want to start seeing the old groot and than that would be perfect. The comedy looks funny and drax was more the left out guardian last time but now it looks like he's in the main spotlight. I liked the trailer. I give it an eight out of ten.

We dont need flashbacks, unless extremely relevant. It's lazy writing. That shit is played out.   This looks to be a win.

Marvel knows how to place the humor so geniously. And Civil War just blew everyone away. If DC would stop rehashing the SAME BAT MAN AND SUPERMAN WITH DIFFRENT ACTORS MAYBE THEY COULD GET SOMEWHERE!! AntMan, Doctor Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Had nothing going for it and it absolutely blew people away and in my opinion that is something DC has only done once with BatMan: The Dark Knight.

The film carries on a few months after the first so Groot is slowly growing so will probably be Baby Groot for only this movie.

Anotherl thing, I don't give a toss about how many dislikes it gets and who gave them. Seems to be an excuse to have a pop at DC fans & the movies.

With the second film, we got a story that furthers the adventures of our favorite characters. We got some more funny moments, plus character development from certain characters if you've seen the film. Plus, I found the villain a lot interesting as Marvel Villains go. The story gets even darker, but at the same time, it keeps you enlightened. Our fav characters are still here we love it. Plus, BABY GROOT EVERYBODY!!!!!!!

2017-05-17T06:28:56,"My quick review: This is nowhere near as good a movie as Guard of Galaxy 1. Some of the visuals are even better than part 1. The first half of the movie dragged on. The main problem was the dialogue was a lot of bathroom humor and goofy bad jokes (and I know this franchise is supposed to have some goofy humor, but it was wayyy overdone) Some of the jokes, and I could care less about censorship or adult humor, were downright disgusting, as in gross. The second half had some excellent action scenes but the action scenes in part 1 seemed better choreographed or something. I would rate it a C+ or B- and part 1 I would give an A. Plot and characters were all over the place. Even for a purposefully light funny and goofy action movie, the jokes mostly fell flat. Worth seeing but nowhere near as cohesive as part 1. Dialogue in action sci fi and comic book movies seems to be getting more and more off-the-wall and silly every year. Every scene does not have to be a snappy dumb one-liner.

I'm just now able to watch this film , and only 10 mins into this flick I'm struck by some very original (very effective) directorial choices that are delighting me to no end. So,, if the rest of this james gunn film is as excellent as the first film and this first sequence of the sequel, why on any planet did ""the internet"" act as interested and excited as an involuntary hooker when the film was available for wide-release (and reviews)?    Maybe, I'm just becoming old-man-who-shakes-fist-at-clouds after the e-vandalism that delights in slagging films like the last jedi in the same way as idiot teens we used to think it was funny to drive around and try to knock mailboxes down with a base-ball bat?  Cause,inexplicably, everyone was ""in the mood"" to yuck it up for ragnarock....folks, if you are part of this new activism fad that groupsources ways to make good films (or any films) bomb simply for the kicks it gives you...you are creating an artificial-market that will cause a similar reaction to a false market that happened just before marvel went bankrupt, who knows what DC did, and all the comic-book store owners lost the businesses they had invested all they had to live in....economics 101.....ok, im gonna watch the rest of guardians 2, and if it's great, I will know a group of people who have been warned what happens to fun things when people play dirty and just want the other team to fail more than they want the entire industry to win....and i will shake myfist at the clouds as well.   sincerely, your friendly hometown et carter   020718",0,0,H.
