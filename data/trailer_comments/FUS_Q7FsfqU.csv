Maybe I'm thinking too much into it because it is 3 am where I live and I haven't slept in around 50 hours but I think they are trying to say that ""I love you"" can be said in thousands of different ways then the words themselves. For instance; telling someone you'll be anywhere and do anything for them even if u don't want to, and letting them know that they were on your mind all day, or sacrificing your entire life plan for that person.
