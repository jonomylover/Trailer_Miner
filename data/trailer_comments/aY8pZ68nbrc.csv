2016-05-06T13:15:38,For the people wondering why blacks in Hollywood always do the same films it's because Hollywood is a very political place and if you don't play your role in it you literally won't exist. A lot of these actors have to accept roles like these because they are not even allowed to audition for the roles like sci fi and high budget films. There are only a few black actors that really have any leverage when it comes to choosing films and thats Denzel Sam L and Will Smith but other than that Hollywood could care less about you if your black they paid monique only 50 thousand to do precious! Amateur white actors are receiving 150 k plus for bullshit roles like there is no debating the message is clear not only in Hollywood but in America as well. It amazes me though that 100's of movies are made each year high budget films too that involve amateur white actors with literally no talent and when you watch the movie your just like WTF. For example how many white scary movies are made where the actors just have no talent? Hollywood is a white space and people need to just accept it.,16,0,Basketball God,aY8pZ68nbrc,-0.024166666666666666,2016-05-06 13:15:38,True,True
