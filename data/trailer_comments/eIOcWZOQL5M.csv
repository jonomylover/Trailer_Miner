2015-05-19T15:38:50,"(sigh) Adam Sandler, .....by having grown-up humor, you make it more CHILDISH. By modernizing the dialogue, you make it more DATED. And by changing the source material, you show how much you DON'T respect what's already perfect. I'm not going to act like everything video game creators wrote was a masterpiece, but when they got it right, they got it right. They don't NEED to be updated. They don't NEED to be fixed. They don't even really need to have MOVIES made about them! But if you're GOING to do it, the very least you can do is understand the source material. They're NOT just simple kids games. They're games that we are continuing to play even today. They're games that we remember years later, even when other games fade from our memory. They're games we will never forget - and for good reason! They're games that helped shape our childhoods, through well thought-out writing, imaginative drawings and endearing morals. And the idea of this... PIXELS... shaping somebody's childhood, the fact that it even has the same name... just makes me sick to my stomach! Maybe these ""simple kids games"" are far more adult than you give them credit for. And I guarantee that'll show, when years later, both children and adults will still be playing these ""simple kids games"" while pandering bullshit like this disappears out of people's consciousness - also for good reason! Good art doesn't come from focus groups and statistics. It comes from people who share how they see things in their own unique way.",0,3,sanslazyb101,eIOcWZOQL5M,0.21857142857142856,2015-05-19 15:38:50,True,True

Hell, it even brought in modern ones! And it worked because of the setting! This taking place nonexclusively in arcades, you'd expect some more popular, modern video game characters to be in it. People like Mario, Sonic, Kirby, Ratchet & Clank (upcoming movie advertisement), Nathan Drake, Master Chief, even a GTA character could work, if developed into it right. THE ENTIRE SMASH BROS. ROSTER could even be thrown in!!! (though the closest we'll probably get is the hammer) That's what this movie could use.  The whole Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man thing is one thing they did right, and I believe they should expand on it.

Honestly, the main reason your watching it is to see Q*bert, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede etc. on the silver screen (that and seeing Peter Dinklage rocking a badass mullet and a bloody sci-fi cannon/minigun thing). The action scenes are amazing and the pixelated video game look really make these scenes feel more fresh and original than they ultimately are. The comedy does make you giggle at points but ultimately it's the same old meh stuff you come to expect in a movie starring Sandler.   Overall, Pixels was a decent enough film which didn't lack originality or fun, but did lack a decent script, and this certainly shows more in certain areas. I rate pixels a 5.9 out of 10. It isn't a bad film and it had a great director and mostly decent cast, but I feel that in the hands of a better writer with slightly altered cast this film could have been so much more.
