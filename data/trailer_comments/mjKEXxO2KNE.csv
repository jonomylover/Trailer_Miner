I remember all the hullabaloo surrounding the incident, this wasn't that long ago. Sullenberger milked his heroism way too long, when to my mind landing a plane safely in the water is more than tough, but it's kinda the goal in being a fucking pilot. A captain should care about their passengers. I mean, a real hero wouldn't call themselves a hero. For all we know, this story could be a lie. Sullenberger could have been a coward and never told the real story? But it's made by white people, so it's okay to be credulous and not question anything. ""It's just a movie"" Cool, then I should have the freedom to feel it's more jingoist propaganda.  Pilots land planes safely everyday, but everyone feels a plane crashing is never possibility. It is every time you get on one. But the fact it all happened in a sensitive post-9/11 New York makes this even more Heroic American Porn for all the historically uneducated to jerk off to. That's all Sullenberger was to the media, they used his image as a trope, as way to make money and profess how great we are as a nation. Makes me want to puke. This hardly deserves to be a full feature film, as Sullenberger and Eastwood don't have anything real to say other than more patriotic-fetishism nonsense. I get it.

Much of the plot of the film revolves around the NTSB investigators suggesting that Sully was not a good pilot because he decided to splash down in the Hudson instead of turning around for a landing back at LaGuardia airport or flying over the Teterboro airport in New Jersey.  Such a ruling would have forced him to take early retirement and lose his license to fly commercial airliners. They had computer simulations that ""proved"" that such an emergency landing could be easily done assuming he had a partially functional left engine.  Things looked bad for Scully for a while, but then some facts emerged that the NTSB had been conveniently concealing.  I don't want to spoil this excellent film by revealing them.  But, I'll just say this.

United Airlines DID NOT have the globe livery until 2010 when they (unfortunately) merged with Continental airlines. These two United planes should have continental written on the side of it. Yes they did fix this in the movie, BUT IT WAS STILL WRONG! Continental never had any ERJ 170s! They labeled the plane in the movie, Continental Connection, but continental connection only had a fleet of ATR‚Äôs and Q400‚Äôs (which one had been involved in Colgan Air 3407 [N200WQ]). The second huge mistake was also the American Airlines planes. THE LIVERY THEY WERE WEARING WAS FROM 2013-PRESENT! In 2009 they still wore the Chrome Livery of the silver paint! Everything at LaGuardia is screwed up in the movie. They somehow got the delta planes correct. (Except back then Delta Airlines was going through new livery repaints since 2008.
