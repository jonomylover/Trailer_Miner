When Daken and Domino repeatedly fail to recover Deadpool's DNA, Weapon X dispatches their most powerful mutants by placing a bounty on Deadpool's head. It attracts the attention of villains such as Omega Red, Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike. Deadpool escapes to New York where he causes massive destruction. It attracts the atention of the Punisher.

I'll be honest I think that movies need to do all these teasers but NOT show any of the movie cos it totally ruins it. I mean you have pretty much seen everything before you watch the movie.

2016-04-02T01:02:02,"simply the most literate ( for deadpool anyway), funny, faithful, and energetic comic book movie in years. The Avengers, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man are the best as far as Marvel Studios goes. But for the X-men universe this film is tops. It is so similar to the first Iron Man in the sense that it tells a very simple story with a very tight run time. Ryan Reynolds will never be confused for Laurence Olivier but his performance just screams energy and total commitment ( and fan familiarity) to the role. Movies this gory ( like Blade) are usually mean spirited and ugly. Deadpool is so self aware and fun that all the violence is not completely off putting. I know they will be making sequels but I wish they just leave it all alone. It will never capture lightening in a bottle like this again. It can't because now we're in on the joke. It may seem like hyperbole but for me, this is already on my top ten list for 2016. Proof that you can make a great action film for a small budget( when did 50 million mean small budget!?). The movie does it right.

2016-07-22T19:23:19,"I've been thinking of watching Deadpool, but I'm not sure. I know it's R rated and everyone says that it was beyond awesome. However, I can't mentally or physically handle the cursing and ""revealing"" scenes. To most people it's no big deal and they tell me to grow up or that I'm being immature. I'm not religious; I do believe in a god, but that has nothing to do with why it effects me in that way. I feel nauseous when I talk or think about coitus and seeing anyone (even babies) naked grosses me out to the point of vomiting. When I hear curse words it feels like I'm being stabbed or punched in the chest. I love the Deadpool charater and I've been waiting for a movie about him since I found out about him in the ultimate spider man series. I really want to see it. Hopefully, I can get through more than 5 minutes of the movie. I believe I know why it effects me in that way.   And it's not something I can just get over because someone tells me to.
