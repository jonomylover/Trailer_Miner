This is basically what will happen  -mother won't let her go outside -new boy showing up.. want to be together with Maddy -mother won't let that happen -nanny/tutor helps Maddy to see him -nanny gets fired -Maddy rans away with Olly -she gets sick -hospital  The 20% is probably just Love and stuff..

2017-02-19T07:20:37,"Ignoring the big plot twist in the book , I still find the whole ""they showed the whole movie"" comments funny.  Especially since it seems this comes because it shows she goes outside???  Of COURSE she goes outside.  Shouldn't you have expected that from just a brief synopsis?  Girl stays inside her whole life until she falls in love which makes her want to broaden her horizons.  No one should ever even *question* if she goes outside.  It would be a pointless movie if she stays inside from start to finish.  As soon as she said she never went outside, they could have cut to black and you still should know she goes outside.You might as well say the fact that they show them kissing spoils the whole movie, because that's another thing that is totally inevitable.  This isn't a movie about *if* she goes outside.  It's about what happens when she does.  How does she experience life after being barred from it for so long?  (Yeah, we know she goes to the water, but since the trailer is less than three minutes, I'm guessing there's a lot they didn't show)It's about the romance.  It's about her relationship with her mother.  And it's about the part in the book that's a twist.

Olly calls her mother, who comes to Hawaii and takes Maddy home. A few weeks later, Maddy gets a letter from the doctor who treated her in Hawaii after she got sick, and in the note the doctor says that Maddy does not have SCID, and she got sick because she had spent her whole life inside and has never formed a natural immunity. Maddy, angry and panicked, searches her mother's medical files, but does not find the test results or doctor's notes that would confirm she had SCID. Instead she finds some notes her mother wrote and a few articles about SCID from the internet. She confronts her mother, who breaks down and admits she does not have SCID. Maddy tells Carla, and Carla says she always suspected that.  A few days later Maddy sees Olly, his sister, and his mother load all their belongings into a moving van while their father is at work, escaping his tyranny. Maddy and Olly continue to email and text. Maddy's mother, after therapy, reveals that right after Maddy's father (a police officer) and her brother died, Maddy got very sick, and her mother, not wanting to lose her, decided she had SCID, and needed to be kept away from the world.
