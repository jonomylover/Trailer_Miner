2019-06-03T02:03:19,"Looks like an epic film.  Important to note Ken Miles was leading the 1966 Le Mans race but near the end, in then typical Ford corporate think, the brass wanted the 3 leading Fords to slow down and cross the finish line 3 abreast.  This caused Miles to not win the race because the French race officials, in their infinite wisdom, said the 2nd place Ford, having started further behind, had been driven more miles and should win the race.  This deprived Ken Miles of his first Le Mans win and the triple crown (Daytona, Sebring, Le Mans) of Endurance racing.  Sadly, Ken Miles was killed while testing the prototype Ford J-Car at Riverside International Raceway just 2 months later.  The J-Car would be heavily modified into the the Ford GT-40 Mk. IV which won the only two races it was entered in, the Sebring 12 hours and the Le Mans 24 Hour races of 1967.",0,1,Bart Y,zyYgDtY2AMY,0.027294685990338165,2019-06-03 02:03:19,True,True

The Ten, is a futuristic short story that revolves around heroes whose spirits are connected to the mightiest entities to ever exist; in order to save the Human Realm from an extra dimensional fugitive with incredible power, ten individuals must merge with the Soul Arms, which will grant them the ability to access the might of their Spirit Guardian's former incarnation.   The story begins by describing Patrick's journey, which begins with his criminal life. While traveling undercover with a biker gang, he accidentally ends up in a strange land; within it, he stumbles across a mystic weapon. The spirits attached to it inform Patrick of his bizarre destiny, which can only be fulfilled if he uses his newfound power to save the undead elders' descendants.   Part 2 follows a king named Kalga, who rules over an isolated tribe within a galaxy that's distant from Earth's. When a royal blacksmith's stock is stolen by mindless-ravenous creatures, he kidnaps the only person that can help him; by arming Kalga with his destined Soul Arm, he's made ready to recover the creations from the magic-infused monsters.",0,0,A L,zyYgDtY2AMY,0.08437499999999999,2019-06-03 21:30:54,True,True

2019-06-10T22:28:04,"I think people forget that Shelby beat Ferrari 3 times before the GT40 in 66.  In 59, Shelby won the 24 hours of LeMans as a driver for Aston Martin and then for two years before the GT40 from 64 to 65 with the Daytona Coupe.  Although Ferrari got the title in 64 because Enzo cancelled the last race (he had the clout and he had the FIA in his backpocket) so Shelby couldn't take the championship...but in my books, Enzo got scared and wimped out.  However, in 65, with Bondurant and Gurney at the wheel, they spanked Ferrari and won their class and took the championship including the 24 of LeMans.  Ken Miles was Shelby's tester for the 63 Cobra and then became his top driver thereafter. Also, I think Damon is the worst choice to play Shelby.  Shelby is over 6 feet tall and Damon is just a tiny speck of dust compared to Shelby.  Bale has some resemblance to Miles but Damon looks way out of place.  And for those who think Ford was behind Shelby's car...you couldn't be further from the truth.  Shelby went to see Ed Cole at ""GM"" first but he wouldn't give him an engine because GM didn't want competition for the Corvette.  So image if GM had given Shelby his engine.

Un‚Äôimmagine che far√† il giro del mondo e rimarr√† negli annali come la sconfitta del colosso americano Ford da parte della Ferrari: uno di quei momenti che hanno fatto diventare la Ferrari un‚Äôicona dello sport motoristico mondiale.    Daytona 1967 -2    Tra Ferrari e Ford √® in corso da due stagioni un vero e proprio scontro sportivo, e la Ford nel 1966 vince a Le Mans, con un arrivo in parata, riuscendo finalmente a conquistare le prime pagine dei giornali. Per Enzo Ferrari √® un grosso smacco, anche perch√© la stagione sportiva delle vetture di Maranello √® complicata, problemi sia in F.1 che con le vetture sport.    Ma nel 1967 la Ferrari sviluppa la nuova 330P4, equipaggiandola con il V 12 di 4 litri a tre valvole per cilindro e con il cambio progettato e realizzato dalla Ferrari stessa. Alcune P3, utilizzate nella stagione precedente, vengono ammodernate con la nuova aerodinamica della P4 e vengono affidate alle scuderie private. Ulteriore cambio di passo a Maranello e l‚Äôincarico a Franco Lini, grande giornalista sportivo e gran interprete dei regolamenti sportivi, del ruolo di Direttore Sportivo.    La 24 ore di Daytona ha inizio e subito per le vetture di Detroit le cose si mettono male: le GT40 si rompono e dopo appena due ore di gara la Ferrari si trova senza il suo pi√π accreditato rivale.    Le vetture di Maranello continuano la gara inanellando sorpassi, per nulla impensierite dagli avversari, ed una volta arrivate al comando, continuano indisturbate fino al traguardo.    Ma poco prima della fine della gara ecco la genialata del nuovo DS. Franco Lini, per vivacizzare la monotonia della gara, ha una intuizione e, da buon ex giornalista, organizza un arrivo in parata delle tre Ferrari per la gioia degli spettatori presenti. Tra gli intenti della Ferrari c‚Äô√® quello di rivendicare l‚Äôarrivo in parata delle Ford a Le Mans dell‚Äôanno prima. Tagliare quel traguardo con tre Ferrari appaiate √® un grande smacco per l‚Äôindustria automobilistica americana.    Davide sconfigge Golia, in casa sua.    Quell‚Äôarrivo in parata √® rimasto nella storia dell‚Äôautomobilismo sportivo. Chris Amon e Lorenzo Bandini sono i vincitori e la loro vettura √® affiancata dalla P4 di Mike Parkes e Ludovico Scarfiotti, seconda e dalla 412P NART di Pedro Rodriguez e Jean Guichet.    L‚Äôindustria europea ha sconfitto, in casa, il colosso statunitense ed il pubblico di Daytona applaude alla schiacciante vittoria.
