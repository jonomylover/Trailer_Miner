2016-04-22T02:54:44,"MOVIE REVIEW AND VIDEO REVIEW ON MY CHANNEL NO SPOILERS/MY OPINION SO ONLY READ IF YOU CARE: Let's just start with all the good. This movie is an extremely suspenseful film about the morality of people. It's a political thriller that is about two governments trying to agree on whether they should kill a terrorist group by hell-fire missiles, capture them, or not take the risk just because there's a little girl nearby the building. It is a movie that is thought provoking and makes you question your own morality with the situation. I loved this aspect of the movie and the last two acts of the film are spectacular. The ending is by far one of my favorite endings of this year. This is all the good I will throw at the movie but like I said about the last 2 acts of the film yet I can't say the same about the first act. The first act of the movie feels slow and is just a set up to the rest of the movie. You barely understand what is going on in the beginning of the film and don't really feel engaged until about 20 minutes into it. The only other flaw I really see with the movie but it can be annoying is the way some of the suspense is built up. Most movies build up suspense by trying different things and giving the characters new obstacles. This movie builds suspense by doing the exact same thing about ten times in a row. The suspense is still building but at the same time it's repetitive and predictable on what will happen next until you reach the conclusion. The ""same thing happening over and over"" that I am referring to is the governments needing to get the approval by everyone for this missile strike!! I understand they want to be realistic but don't sacrifice suspense and don't annoy your audience just because you want to put the same obstacle in the movie about ten times.

2016-07-02T02:29:54,"I could not understand after watching this movie why it was ever released or made for that matter. It is premised on a single case of the military deciding to use a drone to bomb a home with multiple terrorist targets inside. The twist is that a single female child is working outside the targeted home and the countries involved are having trouble deciding if the life of this one child is worth more then the 50 lives that would be saved by killing the terrorists. The decision is being coordinated between two countries and is ran up and down the chain of command in an exaggerated quest for someone to accept and be accountable for the action. I personally do not see the decision to be remotely morally challenging and I hope my government is not wasting time and lives worrying about such a small loss of life. In the end they decide to drop the bomb and both the terrorists and the child are killed. Today I discovered why this movie was made. The headlines I am reading now are ""Pres Obama to issue executive order to make protecting civilians part of military's plans"". Does anyone else see the link between Hollywood and the government?
