It's really not just people being butt over it being not DC but more like how the previous movies somehow built up to this. The Thor storyline was going dark, but the trailer frames the third installment like a 100% comedy filler movie. People are going to take this like a gotg rip off or them trying to dial up the comedy in a place it really shouldn't be that high. It makes sense, especially when the only thing to go off of is the trailer. The purpose of the trailer is to give people a taste and get them in the seats from it.

'Why is he happy to fight Hulk?'. HE'S THOR. Hulk can punch him and he's gonna be fine. If you've read at least one comic run with Thor in it, you'll know he LOVES brawling. If you haven't read one, the Thor movies would have been enough.  Personally, I'm more curious than anything about why the director decided a retro vibe to go with the movie's end-of-the-world storyline. I don't know how the movie's gonna turn out but this teaser sold me to watching the next trailers and the movie. Until I see the movie, then and only then can I tell what I think about the retro vibe about the film and how they incorporated it with a movie that tackles a serious storyline.

2017-11-05T01:14:50,"jI ust saw it.. hands down the best Thor in the series.. and about 2X as good the previous Thor movies- note even critics that Didn't like it (you will always have haters) said it was by far the best of the franchise. Fantastic story, action, character interaction, pacing, humor, and continuity.  The Humor is there to help offset some really REALLY sad moments and events. I loved this movie because unlike the previous Thor, it makes some BIG  changes to the marvel universe and really sets things up and keeps things moving for continuity. It has a very independent bold yet fairly faithful respect to the comics.  My favorite Thor movie hands down, and most enjoyable to watch. Could easily watch it again. There are some amazing moments but none that would have you calling BS, as it is all laid out, explained and has continuity with the marvel universe and characters.. VERY well put together movie. Great performances. great everything..  10/10",0,0,Richard Brout,eQVXIPVRbCU,0.33688888888888896,2017-11-05 01:14:50,False,True
