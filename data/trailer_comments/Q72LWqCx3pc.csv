I don't believe in cyber bullying for me personally because I can just delete my accounts and never see it again. As well as the fact that I think that if you can't say it to my face, you're irrelevant. But not everyone is like me. And calling people ""retards"" (which is quite offensive) and saying you lost hope in my generation because we would watch this movie is exactly what leads to people committing suicide. The exact point is to not treat people like their the worst thing possible because they decided to have fun and got drunk and did some things they wouldn't normally do if they were sober. Because there are people who have taken their lives because of this exact treatment. There are people who feel worthless by what their peers say about them. This isn't some serial killer with a mask. This isn't some demon who is there because you built a house on they're grave. This is a movie about the tormented turning around and tormenting when they had to do was be DECENT PEOPLE and get her to safety and take care of her. THIS IS AN EXAGGERATION OF A CURRENT SITUATION. YOU CANNOT SAY IT'S BAD BECAUSE YOU WANT TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE KILLING THEMSELVES BY BEING CYBERBULLIED. THAT'S WHY MY GENERATION WILL WATCH THIS.

Before all the haunting stuff comes into play everything else is very much true to what can and has happened in real life. It truly shows how social media and cyber bullying affect this generation. It really is sad how swept up our generation has gotten into technology and social media, ironic I'm typing this on a YouTube video I know. I know technology has many positive aspects, but the internet has really caused, in my opinion, this generation of teenagers and preteens to (try to) act ""older"" (ie: cursing, fighting, drinking, partying, sex). It has also opened so many doors for bullying. Everyone knows because you're behind a computer screen it's so much easier to target others. I think this movie really sheds light on these things and I really hope it opens peoples eyes. Not to mention it looks like it sheds light on sexual assault... Not sure about that though. So say this movie looks dumb, but I think it really does open peoples eyes to what our generation, sort of, has turned into.",1,0,Caroline,Q72LWqCx3pc,0.13850461133069827,2015-01-15 02:38:10,True,True

They don't ""magically"" come back. The bullies get away with it nice and clean and then maybe laugh it off and feel a little twinge of guilt later in life. We don't need shit movies to spread awareness, we just need people that are willing to speak up, not to mention _help._ I know there are definitely growing support groups out there. Honestly the first thing I thought of this was that they were making a mockery out of the whole Amanda Todd shabang, which made me even more mad, not that I defended what she did since it was clear some of the videos/photos were put out intentionally and used for attention, but because illuminating this sensitive topic in this kind of light takes away from the whole concept that cyber bullying is actually a wrong thing. Sure, people may rethink themselves and feel shaken after this movie if they are bullies themselves... but not because it's morally wrong. Oh, no, it's because the *ghosts of your teenage antics will entice you to shove your hands in a blender*. //waves fingers magically It bothers me because it suddenly makes the victim the enemy, and the enemies victimized, as though the bullies should be pitied now instead. I'm not going to watch this. I'm going to wait until someone fucking awesome screenwriter comes along and makes a mind-blowing feature to do with internet and social habits and bullying, and actually portrays the deeper messages that need to be sent in regards to this topic.  On a side note, thoroughly disappointed with the representation of Skype. We all know that no video chat ever looks and works so smoothly without lag.

Sadly for the generation we live in though it's a small budget film that will make a lot of money because the teens in this generation for some reason like these bad movies like this. Ever since the age limit for rated R movies came in Horror and Scary movies have progressively gotten worse. I blame movies like Paranormal Activity, Ghost Ship, Freddy vs Jason, The Devil Inside for this. There's been so many bad ""Horror"" and ""Scary"" Movies in this generation it's ridiculous. I don't think this movie is worth a theater watch but it's worth a watch when it comes out elsewhere. Seems like the whole main plot was shown in the trailer except for whose starts killing them.

Remember back in the 90's where we remembered people by taking pictures and putting them in a photo album? The photo album wasn't shared with the whole world. I don't know, call me old fashioned or whatever but I believe complete strangers don't need to know about the people you know or what you do in your personal lives. Nothing is sacred anymore; no privacy no peace. I missed the times where you didn't see a friend for awhile and they just happen to call you years later and you would be so excited to talk to them. Now with the internet you can see your friend everyday by Skype or messaging them on Facebook, Instagram etc. It's just, to me, loses the excitement of reconnecting with old friends if you can see them everyday. I personally wish I could relive the 80's and 90's before the internet because everything seemed so authentic back then. Everyone back then seemed more patient, humans actually interacted with another, and were less narcissistic. Now, all I see is everyone walking around on their cellphones like robots and they miss out on things because they are so preoccupied in their own little world.

Instagram, Twitter, etc all do this, after you delete your pictures, tweets, etc it is then processed to a deleting queue. Which deletes it permanently off of the Servers (about a couple months). So unless some creep likes to screenshot all your crap and will keep them for eternity and somehow use it against you (OK weird), you'll be fine if you delete your mistakes off the internet. Remember the less time online the less risk of that happening.

2015-01-16T10:11:56,"This ""Online Ghost"" shit is fucking stupid. I guess it represents a ghost cyberbullied into suicide from either being unfriended or just wronged. And so the vengeful ghost kills everyone online? That's just stupid IMO.   What I do like is that they actually give a reason to make characters carry the camera around with them. Unlike Paranormal where they carry Cameras and hold it 24/7 all the damn time for no reason, or just place shit tons of cameras everywhere for no fucking reason.   But I'm still iffy about the concept of ""Hang up, and die."" Because why stay if your dying anyways? Or is it if they try, the ghost forces them to suicide on camera?

That girl shouldn't have been going to a party where she knew she would get drunk and do some stupid shit. Second, what the fuck is up with the dumbasses recording her suicide? Oh wait, nowadays most people don't give a shit about the person who is about to kill herself and make no attempt to stop her, just as long as they have it on video. Lastly, who ever was the one who posted the video (most likely the last girl surviver) deserved to die. Why? Well assuming it was her, (the last surviver) she decided not to come clean and because of that, her friends are dead. Way to go you stupid bitch.

2015-01-17T15:06:22,"So an entire movie about promoting Skype as its product plugin, and the entire movie takes place through Skype. Ill watch it just to get a review going, ill say this so far from the trailer though. Despite how stupid this may look to most people, from a creative and director stand point, the idea of having an entire movie acted out through webcams and an internet connection that's perfect beyond belief is both retarded and genius. Le'ts admit it, the concept and money invested could have been used in better ways. But the way they managed to sell an entire movie and make it engaging with random actors on webcams was pretty creative. It brings something different to the horror movies we are all used to. From a marketing point of view its genius, they are obviously targeting young adults and high school students who are avid social media users which will talk about this the next day in class giving it word to mouth promotion. Most importantly, it creates a huge possibility for real life Skype users, maybe not the possessions and scary things, but the over all idea that someone can take revenge for causing the suicide of an actual person. It also promotes a positive message in a crazy way, ""Don't bully people for their mistakes or you will shove your hand in a blender against your will"" sounds pretty convincing if you ask me. Take note that the rumors going around of the movie having something to do with a real life story ""May"" be a lie. Subscribe to my channel and give this comment a thumbs up if you enjoyed what you have read.

2015-01-24T09:37:14,"Few things here, its premise is interesting but... well the girl in question got drunk on her own accord around people she couldn't really trust, which makes it her own fault. Another issue is that she knew she was recorded, so wouldn't she have known who recorded it? There is also another issue, if she really wanted to know who filmed her why also kill the people that didn't film - that makes her miles worse than her friends. She also committed suicide which is understandable when someone just can't take the teasing anymore, but the problem is that why did she wait til a YEAR after to start this shit?! I may be a @CinemaSins¬† rip off here but here are some questions as well. If the ghost had the ability to obtain files and upload them and show them, how is it that she can't just get the file that contains her video in the same fashion to figure out who filmed her? Also, how the hell did she know who to narrow it down to? Correct me if im mistaken, but it was party - where a lot of people could be. Chances are one of the people who filmed her isn't even her friend. And even if it was it still doesnt make sense that she doesn't know who did because she was shown to clearly be able to show the video of the cheating girlfriend, on top fo that fact that she was shown to be sober at the start!. Another problem, Youtube pornography. And youtube video does not contain a lapdance....Now i know it didn't specify where all the victims were, but how is it that all of this is happening and not a single person from the outside world intervenes? They could be in a dorm, parents house, friends house, apartment.... and no one noticed anything? Especially when it ALL boils down to it being the girls fault for getting drunk in the first place. Yeah whoever uploaded the video is a huge asshole which surprisingly wasn't eating an apple, but she gave them the opportunity without a second thought. In other words, the main focus of the story is literally the biggest villain, and at fault, based on what i am seeing from this trailer. Something tells me we are going to get a twitter and tumblr sequel and im okay with and im still not okay with that. Also the ghost is a dick to blenders and computer equipment... ¬†- Sorry I just had to do that part at least....-",0,0,Dawn of Mike,Q72LWqCx3pc,0.058042328042328034,2015-01-24 09:37:14,True,True

(also the way the camera moved shows it to be a recoil from gun going off, YOU CANT RECOIL 3RD PARTY LIKE THAT FROM A PISTOL)  -to the main plot that she started killing her friends to find out who posted the video as a evil ghost. saying she really has no idea who did it to start blaming her friends. well back at the party it literally could have been anybody who recorded seeming a bunch of¬† classmate minors getting shit faced with a untold number of adults there who could pull of this party. so what if its not one of your friends? are you going to kill the only people who were good to you on a bullshit revenge story with none for the facts? damn she really is a waste of space.  -Skype isn't even that good. use team-speak its better.  -lastly seeming how the message is that no one knew who posted the video, this is impossible for a year later and the story not fully solved and taken care of. there would have been a full internal investigation with the police, school board and Facebook. for one they would have contacted Facebook saying they needed the information about a recent suicide investigation and Facebook wanting not damage their reputation, would have gotten their sever admins to retrieve the info and they would know who did what. not to mention funding anti bullying campaigns out the ass.   so in a nut shell, this story is a about a consented video of a passed out girl at a party that could never have happened. only to be flamed on Facebook, killed herself, comeback a year later as a evil ghost not knowing who did it with what it seems like omnipotent killing potential and general computer knowledge/usage. to start killing her mac using friends who might not have anything thing to do about it. who is with me?

2015-02-14T20:13:09,¬†If you ask me the movie teaches against cyber bullying. If you bully someone and they commit suicide your responsible for his/her death. Eventually your karma will finally catch up to you and it will be all over. Anyways the point is no matter how much that person is embarrassing themselves you have no right to post the picture/video web to humiliate that person.

2015-02-22T23:26:30,"This concept has definitely been done in dozens, if not hundreds of variations: a group of friends are directly or indirectly involved in the death or humiliation of one seemingly innocent or exploited, after which the victim seeks revenge either themselves or through other means. Though the premise may be all but drained of originality at this point, I do still find that expanding on it in progressively branching tactics allows for continued enjoyment and genuine scares at points depending on how the material is utilized. I just saw the trailer, and considering what I've seen of horror flicks already and the immediate predictability of the story, I was surprisingly chilled. This is not meant as bragging at all, it's just rare for me these days.  One of my greatest fears has always been the notion of an intruder entering or gaining control over my home with me inside but not knowing until it's too late. The moment when the power went out in all their houses on the chat boxes, I was reminded of the last time I felt such fear, the scene of ""When a Stranger Calls"" where it was revealed the calls were coming from inside the house. That instinctive fear of having one's privacy violated is what I believe makes these films affect people even after the millionth time they're done. This online chatting was used in similar fashion in the film The Den, but the execution was admittedly fresh and eerily grounded. Hopefully this produces the same result. And for all those preaching the trailer's hilarity, all I can say is that if it were you being stalked by someone you thought was dead, you might sing a different tune. Anyone who's survived a real cyber killer will tell you that being mindful of how they can find or hurt you with today's technology should always be taken seriously. There's nothing invalid about criticizing a film's quality, and I'm not suggesting we all live in perpetual paranoia, but only fools forsake caution altogether thinking they know better.",0,0,Keith,Q72LWqCx3pc,0.14104683195592285,2015-02-22 23:26:30,True,True

None of you have even saw the movie so why are you assuming its not scary or that its stupid. For me, I think the movie is going to be intresting because I like the ""who did it and why"" type of ideas.  Wish I could have been a part of this idea because its brilliant.  When I become an actress or if I were an  actress, your hateful opinions would not matter. Everybody who created this movie is is going to make a shit load of money off this because 90% of you are going to watch it rather its stupid or not. Rather its in a movie theatre or On netflix. Your money, the greater majority, and their decision to make this movie are the only things that matter. Not your irrelevant negativity.

(in this case it's necessary to rage quit on your computer. destroy the monitor and shit.) 2: Unplug your fucking modem and disconnect your phone lines. 3: if your phone is wi-fi only, shut it off, then remove the battery and burn it. If your phone is LTE, Ax it. 4: Pack ONLY the essential resources and get the hell out of dodge. (By that i mean your house and town.) 5: Don't use any phone for ANY reason 6: go to Alaska and wait for this shit to blow over. If you posted the video, DO NOTll go back to modern society. 7: Don't attempt to save your friends they will die eventually anyway. Hope some survived. 8: Go to the white house and hide in the president's bunker (If you can) 9: Kill anyone who ask's about the video. 10: DO NOT bring a blender with you. 11: If you see a blender and feel the sudden urge to make a handshake, RESIST WITH ALL OF YOUR WILL!!!  12: Basically, don't bring any appliance that you can stick your hand into. (Ex, food processor, blender, toaster, etc.)  13: Get plastic surgery to change your face and pay with CASH ONLY. If you can't afford it, get the surgery, pay them fake money, and run out of the hospital. 14: Change ALL of your names.

Though it does look promising (Insidious wasn't scary but it was still a good, creepy movie), I am very 50/50 on this. Wait a minute, if Laura (I presume is the entity causing all this) didn't want anyone posting a video on her suicide, then why in the holy mother of ASS would she kill herself in public?

2015-04-05T06:24:40,"  If MTV's goal with this film was to promote anti cyberbullying or bullying in general, then I say it was an epic fail. What I see is a film that further reinforces to today's youth that you don't have to be held responsible for your actions and that it's always someone else's fault, in addition to lacking any sort of integrity on part of her peers. I mean seriously? ""hey blair....who posted the video that someone happened to get of me acting completely afool and like an utter out of control moron, since I forgot that pretty much everyone has a video camera on their phone? I was too busy acting too moronic to actually care or think.""   As mentioned, was there not anyone at the party (perhaps one of her so called ""friends"") who possessed any iota of integrity to perhaps cut her off once they realized she had passed her limit and take her home? Or is it much more fun to go along with the rest of the crowd and disparage and ridicule her for fear that you'll be ridiculed too for actually trying to intervene and help?   If MTV wants to send some sort of ""message"", why not make a film that delineates someone actually doing the right thing in that particular instance and actually possessing a sense of morality and standing up for themselves and someone else who can't stand up for themselves so to speak at a particular moment, instead of a film that just further shows how irresponsible, immoral, insensitive, and ignorant the youth of today's society (just society in general actually) is and then blaming someone else for it?

It could be a great idea, but from this it looks horribly executed. I love horror movies, especially dealing with spirits seeking revenge, but this is not how you carry it out. You need to at least try to make the audience feel connected to the character. I don't feel connected to her at all, she only seems like a random person to me. That suicide looks fake as fuck too. There are other ways to make it look realistic. PS This is not the first time a horror movie like this has been made. I can think of a paranormal revenge/technology series that was very good actually, though it isn't in English (The American remake of the first one was *horrible* and I hope they never continue it, they sucked out all meaning and redid it until it was just bad) Chakushin Ari is the series, and there are 3 movies yet it's still good. Not hard to find it with EN subs. Anyone reading this comment, if you want an emotional horror/paranormal revenge/technology film that's not rubbish look for the 3 Chakushin Ari movies.

OK next... uuuummm.. I don't even know what to bash on next. There is just so much to cover..  ok ok when have you seen a girl who's not white kill herself... (never).. well that's that last of all on that racism shit  they could just leave Skype.. people say they would die if they left... look I have watched this about a billion times (sarcasm you fags) I know where the source of this misconception is.. the man says he is going to leave the call but the girl says.... ""no! no! no! i will kill you!!""  (she says i motherfucker!!! i  i i  bitch!!! )  so they could leave and then NOT DIE!!!! OK #3 she can control her friends and can't make them tell who posted it?!?!?! I mean I get the concept but the concepts dumb.

2015-04-21T04:16:46,"I like the premise, but this movie honestly sucked lol. Interesting filmmaking technique of having everyone on Skype, but it's basically an evolution of the shaky ""found footage"" concept that wears out really fast. Watching a damn computer screen for an hour and a half got tiring. Terrible execution, wasn't even scary or unsettling (aside from maybe the creative methods of death, though even that's stretching it), then I saw it was produced by Timur Bekmambetov and suddenly it made sense to me why this movie sucked so bad (he's responsible for such flops as Wanted and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter). Good as far as to teach a lesson I suppose, but I'm getting really sick of the whole ghost/evil spirit/possession trope in modern horror films. It's been years since I saw a film that was truly unsettling, and it boggles my mind why they continue wasting money on the same repackaged dross. Plenty more is unsettling about real-life people than is shown in slasher flicks, minor tales of psychological manipulation, or demon possession.",2,0,Peter von Harten,Q72LWqCx3pc,-0.01857142857142857,2015-04-21 04:16:46,False,True

Right next to ""The Den,"" ""Paranormal Activity,"" and ""The Blair Witch Project,"" this movie makes me chills that it's hard not to watch this, but I'm glad that paid to see this movie because they advertise this movie to go see it. Well, Unfriended is a movie about group of teenagers are chatting each other Skype until unknown hacker is planning to kill each of those friends who cyber bullied over one girl from year ago. I won't spoil the ending because it gives you a big twist of who is who teased Ms. Barns in purpose. Some of the creepy imagery and the video quality is fucking intense and I was shock in each scene that they're brutally against one of the teenagers. The characters are okay, but they're all stereotypical. But one main character is the perspective of logging on the computer to see where the cyber killer is.

2015-04-30T21:55:48,"SPOILER:              Set in Fresno, California, the story of Unfriended is told through a screencast of the laptop of a high school student named Blaire Lily (Shelley Hennig), one year after her childhood friend Laura Barns (Heather Sossaman) killed herself because of incessant online abuse she received from a YouTube video. Blaire briefly watches a recording of the suicide before she is contacted over Skype by her boyfriend Mitch Roussel (Moses Jacob Storm). She indicates to them that they will lose their virginities to each other that year at prom, which leads to a racy video call that is ultimately interrupted by three of their friends: Jess Felton (Renee Olstead), Ken Smith (Jacob Wysocki), and Adam Sewell (Will Peltz), as well as an unnamed, faceless account with the screen name billie227.  Blaire notices billie227, and the team make several unsuccessful attempts to get rid of the user. Laura's Facebook account starts sending cryptic messages to the friends, but Blaire fails to report or memorialize the account to Facebook, offending ""Laura"" when she ""unfriends"" the abusive account. The friends suspect that another girl, Val Rommel (Courtney Halverson), is using the accounts to prank them, so they call her up and she joins the chat. The friends' Facebook accounts are updated with compromising pictures of each other, leading to massive arguments as none of the friends are uploading anything. Text messages appear in the Skype chat, none of which were written by the people whose accounts posted them. Val calls 911 to report online abuse. Ken reveals that he personally did not like Laura while Blaire types out several messages to Mitch without sending them, implying that Laura may have been abused by her uncle.  Soon after Val calls 911, Laura emails Blaire an Instagram picture revealing that Val commented on the abusive video, telling Laura to kill herself. Comments pour in from Instagram users, expressing their hatred for Val. Val's Skype video feed is interrupted and she reappears as a seemingly frozen image in a bathroom, sitting next to an open bottle of bleach. Concerned, Blaire calls her only for the group to see Val's phone, propelled by vibration, moving across the bottom of her screen while an unresponsive Val continues to blankly stare wide-eyed at the camera. All of the friends also comment on how the mirror set behind her in the room is evidently shattered. A loud bang is heard and the computer falls; the police arrive and the remaining friends decode the police code used to classify her death, which is being labeled a suicide. Though not explicitly stated or seen, it is heavily implied that Val was forced to drink the bleach.  Laura begins sending photos to the group. Mitch and the others don't open theirs out of fright, but Blaire does and sees they reveal her sleeping with Adam. Having had enough, Ken manages to email Trojan horse removal software to rid everyone's computers from the malicious account. Despite threats from Laura, they apparently get her off of their Skype call. This reprieve is short lived, as Laura answers the phone when Adam calls the police, and resurfaces on Skype with a camera view that is behind a lattice in Ken's room, set looking at him from the back. When Ken finds the source of the video, he looks at it in horror and doesn't respond to his friends asking him what he is seeing before his video feed is stilled and then disconnected. Fragments of the video do come in shortly thereafter, showing him being attacked by an unseen force, then mangling his arm in a blender, before dying by breaking the blender and using the blades to slice his throat.  Laura then forces the four remaining friends to play Never Have I Ever, threatening to end the loser's life. Through this game, Laura reveals dark secrets that put the friends at odds with each other: Jess spread a rumor that Blaire was anorexic, Adam bargained with Laura to trade Jess' life for his, and Mitch ratted Adam out to the cops for selling cannabis. An ensuing argument between the four ensures before a drunk Adam becomes enraged and uses the game to reveal that Blaire is no longer a virgin and in fact had sex with him to Mitch's unknowing; Laura uploads a video of them having sex to YouTube to prove it. Both Blaire and Adam receive messages from their printer, and refuse to reveal them. Mitch becomes furious that Blaire and Adam are apparently ""sending notes"" and threatens to leave his bedroom. Laura insists that if he leaves his computer he will die, and in a moment of high tension, Blaire reveals her note which states ""If you reveal this note, Adam will die."" Adam promptly shoots himself in the head as his camera reveals his note: ""If you reveal this note, Blaire will die.""  Laura insists that the game is still going on and asks whether anyone has ever defaced Laura's grave. After Jess refuses to admit to it, Laura turns off the lights in her house, and Jess locks herself in her bathroom while Blaire goes on to Chatroulette to call for help. Blaire successfully gets someone to call the police, but Jess' video feed comes back to show Jess being thrown across the room. Seconds after, she is choking on a hot hair curling iron shoved in her throat, soon killing her. Laura then uploads an image to Facebook of Jess with the curling iron in her throat with the caption ""Looks like she finally STFU."" Laura pressures Blaire and Mitch into admitting who posted the video in the first place, with Blaire admitting that it was Mitch at the last moment. Mitch stabs himself through the head with a large knife, leaving Blaire all alone.  Laura insists that Blaire confess one further thing while Blaire professes her innocence while trying to reason with her past friend by showing her the good times they used to have. Laura then uploads the full video that caused her to commit suicide to Facebook; however, in this one, Blaire turns the camera back to reveal that she was the cameraman, laughing and saying, ""I got her."" Blaire's Facebook account becomes flooded with hate comments as she silently watches. Laura tells her that she wishes she could forgive her as she signs off of Skype. Suddenly, the door opens in Blaire's room, while unseen hands begin to close her laptop.

EVERY.SINGLE.SOUL.  Why is this a problem? well because horror, true horror, comes from us being scared of something bad happening to someone we care about, or at least can sympathize with to a degree. When you make us hate the cast so much that we root and cheer when they get harmed or killed, you just know you're not gonna get us scared when, big shock, they get harmed or killed.  Would it be so hard to make the dead girl an actual nice, or at least decent girl? no, you had to make her a bully too, thus giving us nobody to root for, no reason to care for the cast, and therefore, no reason to care for the plot, or what happens to them.

2015-06-13T07:19:35,"It's an okay movie for viewing on your desktop. A lot of reading, only seeing a computer desktop from beginning to end. But it is nice. It only cost 1 million dollars to make which I assume went mostly to the actors because the whole movie was a computer desktop: A lot of reading and a lot of reading, a lot of reading (yeah when I watched it it was also like that), a lot of reading. And Skype calls. A lot of reading. Watching it in the cinema was like watching someone share their desktop from beginning to end. If I had known this I would have waited for the DVD (this movie doesn't require BlueRay because there aren't any cinematic moments to share, just a lot of reading). A lot of reading. Blair Witch project at least had some camera work and that cost just $600.000. This looked just like screen capturing and a few shocking video parts. but mostly a lot of reading. Getting bored with me saying reading? This was as boring as it got. I went to a few million dollar cinema to watch it and the only thing I was fed was screen capturing kind of movie. Not even quality like blair witch which has cost even less.¬†  We have had such great trailers and this is what we got? We were shown Insidious Chapter 3, and Batman v Superman, that looked exciting! Can't wait to see it! Not just Skype calls, chats and email and only from beginning to end desktop... A movie you should only watch at home on your computer because it is ONLY A DESKTOP from beginning to end. Won't get my money back on this one to watch it in a cinema. We had all the electronical equipment you can imagine to create an experience. Great sound to only hear skype sounds, chat sounds. A wonderful screen and only see desktop behavior. Not much really had to be used for this movie. You can watch it on your phone. We were watching a movie that was looking like ""Share your screen"" from beginning to end. I was disappointed.¬†  This is not the experience I want when I go to a fully equipped cinema to blow me away. Just to watch a screen capturing movie and A LOT OF READING. You know what reads well, Books.¬†  I understand the sentiment of that it tries to get a new genre. Great movies don't have to follow the standard genre. A new way of a movie, like blair witch. But damn, I had to see this thing in a expensive cinema? This thing is not worth watching it in a cinema. Great equipment and totally unused. Too much effort to go to a cinema to make it worth the while and pay so much. They should have published it on a streaming media and they would have been spot on. I would have appreciated that. But now I just want to really experience cinematic effects for which I go to a cinema. Can't wait for real cinema movies like Warcrarft or Assassins Creed. Worth your time to watch in a cinema.  In short: The movie is a 6/10, watching. In a cinema it is 1/10. Don't waste your time on that. You can't name a movie more worthless to watch it there.",0,0,FreddyFish,Q72LWqCx3pc,0.0841309731934732,2015-06-13 07:19:35,False,True

2015-07-11T07:57:22,"I'm sorry but that is absolutely ridiculous. Unfriended is obviously one of the new films in the ""cybernatural"" genre.¬†  It's kind of like this. A young kid is told that he shouldn't steal from the store. So he steals a candy bar one day, and his mother or father slap the shit out of him or whatever, and they then think all is okay. Though everything is not okay. The kid is now scared that if he steals candy again either a). don't get caught or b). if you do get caught you are going to get hit.  There are actual LEGIT reasons why people shouldn't steal, but if kids growing up only knowing that the reason they shouldn't do anything is ONLY because there will be a punishment I personally believe that isn't what should be instilled into children. I would like the next generation to know that you don't steal, bully, harass, stalk, make fun of, drive drunk, etc etc etc because there are REAL legit reasons that you shouldn't. Kid's shouldn't be programmed to not bully others because a supernatural entity might kill them over the internet. They shouldn't do it, because its not a nice thing to do.¬†  The other issue is this movie is rated R, yet CLEARLY is going for a demographic much younger. Clearly the MPAA is a corrupt system (the ratings boards are absolute nonsense) I could give a million examples, but just one is with language... that with all the even with all the violence seen in PG-13 films that when you use the ""fuck"" in a film;¬† Example: ""Damn, I had a dream I was fucking Kelly last night"" (rated R) ""Damn, that fucking chair is in my way!"" (rated pg-13)  So then violence is totally okay, but language and sex is completely off limits and immediately considered TABOO. So though I have gone WAY off point, I don't give a lot of credit to the fact that its obviously a movie aimed for people under 17 - 25 yr old demo (obviously others will see it, but I think that it's main demographic), so most of them wouldn't even be able to see it.... I dunno... the whole movie to me seems a bit off when there are real ACTUAL stories to be told that could be done better.

2015-11-09T08:34:53,"There are a lot of ridiculous issues with this movie. My favorite being the part where Blaire decided to go on Chatroulette and try to get someone to call the police for so they can help her friend instead of *actually calling the police herself* She knew the address and everything. It made absolutely no sense why she couldn't get up and get the phone so she could help her friend. Then there was this other part where she shared her screen for about a minute, and just never turned it off. Everyone acted like they couldn't see her screen anymore. It showed her turning it on, but never off. I guess it's just too... unrealistic to me. I don't really get the point of this movie. If there was some underlying theme to the movie like ""Don't cyberbully"" it didn't come off very clear. You made a movie about cyberbullies getting cyberbullied by a *ghost.* It really, really isn't a good movie if you expected to watch something interesting.
