And they're even throwing Casey Jones in as well, so even more of the old original stuff is making a debut (I know we had Casey in the old 90s films, but the third one was so wtf-worthy, and again, lack of the aforementioned mutants). Roll out the pizzas! That Turtle Van is badass. I prefer the old original look of the turtles, but lots of things are making up for their weird looks (particularly Donatello; we've known since 1984 that he's the smart one, so the geek glasses and heavy-gear backpack weren't necessary). Question though - is it necessary for April to show so much skin? She didn't do that in the original...just because Michael Bay has a constant hard-on for her isn't an excuse. >.< Still not content with her in that role, but hey, this looks awesome!

Film 2: The turtles help vigilante Casey Jones take out the Purple Dragons led by Hun (who secretly works for Shredder just like Stockman) the the second half adapts the Shredder Strikes Back storyline; Leo's ambush by the Foot Elite and the attack/fire at April's apartment, Shredder aided by the recently mutated Bebop and Rocksteady (not as incompetent as the show).   Film 3: Adapts the Return to New York storyline: the first third deals with Leo's recovery, then the assault on Shredder's lair, the turtles face the Elite, Bebop and Rocksteady, Hun and the recently mutated Baxter Fly. The final battle is between Shredder and Leo while the others fight the mutants, ending with Shredder's decapitation.

2019-11-30T20:26:48,"what no one realizes in the original comics April O Neil never had red hair, she originally had black or brown hair. It wasn't until the 90's when she had the iconic red hair from the 2003-2007 animated series, 2007 movie, and 2012-2019 animated series. Because even in the 87 animated series and 90's movies April doesn't have red hair, she has either brown or light brown hair. You want to hate on Megan Fox? Really? There was nothing wrong with those movies. I'm not a fan of the 87 animated series, though if I vent about this comment would be longer that it is right now. Though if you want to really know how I feel about it and you want to go 12 rounds with me and my knowledge of TMNT bring it! Because no one has clearly watched the original since half the characters would show up at the most random times. Half the characters like Mona Lisa for example only showed up one time and never came back. I know this because I have the book TMNT Ultimate History of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Plus the only reason why TMNT got as popular as is it now, is because of the Mini Con in Portsmouth, NH featuring the first comic book issue which was in June 1984. Plus Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman themselves didn't think the comics and franchise that's why they went with Mirage studios which at the time was low end it wasn't as popular like 20th Century Fox, Paramount, Columbia, or TriStar just to name a few. Because if the TMNT franchise didn't go off then the creators want to have it be under a big name studio.
