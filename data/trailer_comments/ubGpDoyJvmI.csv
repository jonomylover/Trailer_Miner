There seems to be more emotion than just a love story and such, or how the importance of one human changes the whole fate of the world. I don't mind the cast choices, I do think those changed actors can do the roles very well (though Bay seems to think putting hot sexy women will drag people to the seats). The main issues though are in just the value Bay will put into this movie, which he had barely done in the previous TR movies, and putting overwhelming effects (though badass as they are) onto the film, thinking it can replace the story and setting.

2014-03-05T14:11:06,Not denying that it looks great as you would expect for a action movie. But it's disappointing when I know the plot is shot. When you can't even begin to form some local reason as to why certain characters appear in the storyline. Oh and to Michael Bay. It's a little late to make Optimus a Mack truck now. Where's Unicron? If the new Star Trek franchise could destoy a planet. Why not Unicron? But I wonder if Peter Cullen partly regrets what's taken place with how Transformers live action franchise has turned out. I know they offered him a huge check to do these movies. So I completely understand the business since it made to say yes. But I'm sure that if I could talk to him off camera what he really thinks of the of the entire franchise. I'm sure he'd say it's shit. But being as critical as I've been so far. I'll still go see it.

2014-03-05T14:41:11,"I loved Transformers as a kid, have collected hundreds of them as an adult, and have thoroughly enjoyed watching all the cartoons from America and Japan. Before 2007 I could honestly say ""I love *everything* Transformers!"" Alas, those days are gone. I absolutely hate this garbage. I didn't see Dark of the Moon, and this trailer is the first and last time I'll watch anything having to do with this. Since when are Transformers made with the same materials used to create that novelty stress-relief desk toy with a pile of magnetic metal shards? Where is the robust interplay between robotic characters with widely varying personalities? And please, the ""action movie hot chick"" angle is enough to make me wretch. Can't wait for Megan Fox as April O'Neil in the TMNT movie, that should be the most memorable acting performance of the century. Destroying everything that made the Transformers great in the name of big action movie bucks... it makes me sick.

2014-03-05T19:16:55,"I like that SL is no longer the main human in the story, never cared for him in these movies and to be honest I thought his characters' inclusion brought the story of each movie down somewhat. The original show had humans, but even back then.. they were better characters than Sam Witwicky or whatever his last name is. The soldiers.. they are ok. Although, they do get worse with each movie.  As a person who grew up watching these cartoons I get that the now a days movies are not going to just be the cartoons remastered with visual effects, i'm not stupid, but just because things must change for the big screen.. doesn't make those changes good. The transformer movies are, so far, more about the humans than about the transformers. Normally, in a alien sci fi movie involving humans, it'd make sense that people are involved but with transformers.. right from the first movie I didn't like the fact that handheld armaments could hurt the larger transformers. Or how they are very quickly, in their own movies getting outpaced by the humans technology.  Where is the crashed ship Optimus Prime operates from, where is the years ( millions if not hundred of thousands, no.. really ) and years of hidden mystery and history that the transformers have with earth and its people? No where, thats where it is. The transformers are just aliens and unless this movie goes OUT OF ITS WAY to somehow make the transformers once again dangerous, i'ma have a hard time believing the humans couldn't eventually handle it all themselves.  To me, giant walking robots who are made of space metal, should infact be somewhat resistant to anything handheld we the humans can think up. It really kinda makes them more into a joke than anything when simply loading up on rounds of a specific type for a shotgun can take out a transformer if they are not careful. these guys are intergalactic warriors, why are the 'primitives' hurting them?  I can except larger weapons. like the gun mounted on the battle ship, even satalite based weaponry, hell even a tank shooting one of them should hurt them, just considering the force behind the shot. Still these movies are not all bad, but at the same time there isn't much i like about them.. I watch them once, maybe twice, then never again, not even for nostalgic sake.  My hopes for this movie is... 1. The fans of these movies enjoy it. I am not among the fans, but seing as you all are going to pay money to go see it in theaters i really hope you all enjoy it and get your moneys worth. 2. That its awesome and draws me back into the fold of the new movies. I don't want to hate these movies, I want to love them.  But lets be honest here.. my faith in this franchises ability to make me like the movies is near non existent. between 'transforming' certain Autobots into stupid caricatures of pop culture, making the movies into short add bursts for certain cars companies or specific vehicles and giving them some rather dumb sounding dialog each movie thus far as slowly destroyed my hope for the franchise as a whole.

Was the 2nd and 3rd film as good, no. Did they have a lot of flaws? Yeah, they did. But were they Transformers films, and fun to watch? Yes.  Not every movie we like has to be a sophisticated, well thought out movie. It's okay to watch a few action movies. People just like transformers so I don't know why everyone hates on these movies. If you don't like them, don't watch them. it's that simple.

2014-03-05T22:16:28,"Pure awesome. The brand new Transformers: Age of Extinction trailer. Thoughts below:  -New Bumblebee is awesome -New Optimus looks great -Action is just as awesome as ever but with a new setting -""Remember Chicago"" is BY FAR the best part of the trailer, glad they don't just pretend Chicago never happened. It makes a lot of sense as a plot device and would make for a good poster for the movie. -Mark Whalberg looks great in his role, though I do miss the old cast. -The part where the Alien ship is sucking up boats and stuff has been done in so many movies HOWEVER, it has never been done by Michael Bay and it looks better here than anywhere else, I guess it's a response to the ""World Engine"" in Man of Steel. -Which cities are they? Because a lot of the movie was shot in Hong Kong but there are American Flags in one of the cities so New York or San Francisco maybe? It would be awesome if they turned the remains of Chicago into a kind of memorial thing, adding to the ""Remeber Chicago"" thing. -Wow there are a lot of American Flags in the trailer, might be a new record. -Did they just kill Ratchet? Or was that the green dude from the Superbowl trailer? -The part where Bumblebee is on a ship and shooting ships chasing him looks great, but is that the Chicago river? There should be construction crews on all the buildings, I don't think you can rebuild them in four years. -Is Hound supposed to be a replacement fro Ironhide? -Where is the Lamborghini from the set photos? -The Chinese setting looks awesome, and glad they are still blowing stuff up in major cities. I thought this would be more like the first movie(which I wouldn't mind.) -Bumblebee riding Swoop? Having Optimus and Bumblebee attack while riding Grimlock and Swoop would be one of the best actions scenes ever.",9,5,Sampat Dasmahapatra,ubGpDoyJvmI,0.4141419294990724,2014-03-05 22:16:28,True,True

I mean really, the same stupid crap from Transformers 3 where the government says they don't need the Autobots. So after Transformers 3, where Cybertron could've been teleported close to Earth and after a Decepticon takeover, the government says they don't need the Autobots *again*, and then Earth gets invaded by Decepticons *again*.  And The humans want to wipe out the Autobots? Even with Mark Wahlberg in this, I still cannot give 2 shits about the stupid humans in this movie & I wanted to because of Mark Wahlberg alone. That is so stupid, trying to wipe out the Autobots(4 years after Transformers 3 and after the fact that for all the humans knew, the Autobots flew into space & their ship was destroyed but the Decepticons invaded anyway) & look what happens, the Decepticons are back, stronger than ever, with a new leader, Galvatron. That's like getting rid of all the Marvel heroes after the events of the 1st Avengers movie. And it doesn't end there, the humans reverse-engineer Transformers, make their own Transformers-like robots & guess what? They gain sentience & want to destroy the human race. That's like winning the war against Skynet, and deciding to reverse engineer those Terminators. Ok, that's it, the humans in this movie deserve to get killed, I'm routing for the Decepticons and this new faction of Transformers  Once again, the bad guys get the good shit & they deserve it.

Yet Optimus busts out of the barn. Okay, could be that Optimus transformed into a beat semi that looked nothing like him. Thats fine. I believe Unicron is the gigantic floating entity, and I saw two Dinobots, Grimlock and a two headed Swoop? Not sure on that one. But for those who are bashing how Optimus knocked out that T-Rex (Grimlock) with one hit, you have to understand that the Dinobots are MUCH more powerful in combat form, and not in ""dinosaur"" form.

Funny how that damn cartoon movie had more heart & soul in it then any of the previous 3 movies because I mean transformers die in that movie and a lot of them die and actually stay dead lol I mean it made you care not just only cuz you were like 5 or 6 years old when it came out but it made you care cuz you knew there was an idea of finality to these characters I mean you cared about them cuz you knew that they could die at anytime ya get it lol omg and if you were a kid plus a big transformers fan and you did not cry when Optimus Prime died I'm sorry man but you either had no soul or you are now officially a psychopath lmfao but it's true I mean my generation gets it right?

The true fans want to see something that incorporates the Transformers lore with some new continuity, seeing as it can't be 100% identical to the cartoon series. Nobody wants a freaking love story. We want to see Autobots fighting Decepticons with minimal human interaction. So, if you want to see Sam Witwicky, there are 3 movies that have him in it.

2014-06-30T05:51:26,"I just saw it and it is the BEST out of the whole series. here's a short review (spoilers)    Mark Wahlberg is a most welcome replacement to Labeouf. The darker tone of this movie is a most welcome addition as well. There is NO stupid/juvenile comedy, unlike the previous 3 in which every single human character is a comic relief, and it had dick, piss, and dog humping jokes, all of that is gone. The acting is pretty good too, with Kelsey Grammer being a great villain, it's like if Hans Gruber was put in a Transformers movie. The movie flat out kills the only comic relief character, who is bad in my opinion, but good if you like TJ Miller, he is killed violently around an hour into the film, when it was just starting to get moving. Optimus Prime is actually more of a character in this one, then a one line spewing machine like in the previous 3, he is going through a personal arc and deciding weather or not he should abandon or save the humans. Also all the dumb lines said by everyone in this movie is actually funny, because they play it straight instead of trying to make it funny and have the lines be told in a goofy way (I'm looking at all the human characters in the previous 3) the lines are all said with a straight face, and it's funnier that way. The only thing that kind of pissed me off in this movie was the douche of a boyfriend Wahlberg's daughter has, oh my god, he is like Labeouf 2.0, he is terrible, but he is thankfully not the main focus, Wahlberg, Grammer, Tucci and the robots are. The film is the best of the 3, but it's not saying much, take it for what it is, a dumb fun action movie, and you'll have a blast. Getting rid of Labeouf and replacing him with Wahlberg makes the film 50 times better and is a good step in the right direction. Also having a good supporting cast (for the most part) with Tucci and Grammer stealing every scene they're in and Lockdown being a creepy and ruthless villain, and having the humans actually do something other then run around was very welcome, Wahlberg actually fights the robots and really is a big help towards the Autobots in this movie. This is the best Transformers movie and if they make them more like this, I may like the series now, but time will only tell.  Final Score: 3.5/5: It's like Commando (1985), dumb, but so much fun",0,0,TheCrazymoviefreak,ubGpDoyJvmI,0.17267665130568355,2014-06-30 05:51:26,False,True

2014-06-30T15:24:16,"BE WARN THIS MIGHT BE SPOILFUL This fourth installment is a disappointment for me. The fact that Michael Bay said to take this movie as a reboot which obviously isn't, mainly due to the fact that the movie is taking taking subsequences from the previous trilogy. Lets see the script, shall we even get in to that? This is a terrible script, just like what Alex stated this is a lazy bad till the bone lack of support and illogical plot till date.  THE HUMAN aspect to this movie is also by far the worst out of the four. Linbingbing's character is totally there just for marketing purposes. And Stanly Tucci's dialog... complete disaster in that part. Cheesy just like Bay likes it. And those awkward chick scenes, really Bay? Tessa's boyfriend was awfully hard to watch. Shane is an Irish in Texas, enough said. I like the father and daughter situation but still was not 'perform' at my expectation despite Mark is such a talented actor. Jack's character didn't won my heart at all, in the matter of fact I wanted to see him fail or fail trying at some point in the movie. He is godawful. AND MICHAEL BAY, you do not rid off a comic relief that early. I hate on how much stupid, yes stupid plots is put into the humans. Like really, with so much effort it still comes off really bad.  THE AUTOBOTS, there are things I liked about what Bay did to the movie was bringing back the old ones including beloved ones into this so 'reboot'. The new autobots are great too. I was most excited for Hound and he was great. By far the best autobot other than bee and Optimus. I won't get into him too much but yea he's my fav now. Bee was same ol' with him still speaking through the radio. There's a darker present in Optimus in this movie than all the 3 combined. I like this new Prime that really shows the true reality. There are some mass shifting like Alex mentioned before but that doesnt really bothered the movie. Bumblebee comes off as a more mischievous character this time around with some time in the movie but none or less the same bee we all love. All the autobots have a certain personallity and I can't say which is my least fav but I find Drift's accent kinda weird. I mean he is suspose to be voice by Ken Watanabe but comes off sounding just urgh can't put my finger on this. Plus he has a third mode as a heli which is kinda weird too. The scenes are really chop up like. I'll let you decide on that part. On to crosshair which I'll come out and  say it  is my least  fav character cause he's kinda a douche. Sorry that it I have for him.  THE DINOBOTS are completely neglected in the movie. Its like Bay only realized he needs to have them in the movie so he just squeezed them in the end. Im disappointed on them the fact that their appearances doesnt serve much really, give Optimus a jetwing and he'll do just fine. Their badass bar really isn't all big of a deal cause when our protagonists really need them they seem to be else where. 40mins isnt enough for the dinobots to show what they can do. Plus they weren't even called Dinobots in the movie. (some legendary warriors if im not mistaken). Grimlock, I am asuming had a chicken like beak... so yeah. To me the dinobots look like they are force to be in this movie and they looked abit out of place. The geo in this movie is as terrible as ROTF. This film has geo issues.  LOCKDOWN is by far the best villain in this franchise. He just comes off as such a badass. He fights only for himself (yea and his creator wateves) and comes off looking so calm and cool. To me, he lacks a little screen time as well just like shockwave in Dark of the Moon. There's is not to complain about his character but the fact that who in the hell in the right mind would place ur prison cell in an escape pod. Enough about him cause I find he  is flawless. As for Galvatron, kinda weak as well again. Not too terribly much about was said about him. His appearance was a phase 1 movement for the following sequel to me. He wasn't really needed but he has an objective tho. This time is the 'seed' thing that the bad guys and ""transformer maker' are so desirely hunting for.  ENDING SPEECH by Optimus was by far the most laughable sentences you have ever heard. Ever Pete can't do it any justice.  It was like they took it off from the Notebook or something. In the the end did I enjoy the movie? Yes, but just the actions, other than that was jus horse turd. I'll rank this the second lowest as my fav will be TF1,TF3,TF4 lastly the worst still revenge of the fallen. These are my points(spoilers) about what I like and dislike about the movie. Don't get me wrong, there are things I like about the movie like the great diverse camera action but they are too many to state.

The acting was never once impressive, unless it was Stanley Tucci or Peter Cullen. But that isn't saying much, since Tucci is good in every movie he is in and Peter Cullen never really steps up his voice acting in these movies. The action started becoming kinda boring in the third act and wasnt spectacular or jaw-dropping in general. The humor was pretty meh in general. But Stanley Tucci had some funny lines. I'll give it 2/5 because the ending, Lockdown, Optimus, Bumblebee, Crosshairs, Galvatron, the Dinobots and Stanley Tucci were cool. The Dinobots were less cool than the rest since they were not the original 5 and their backstory was bullshit. But they looked cool, so props to that though...  *Sigh...

2020-04-30T19:04:19,"6 years ago this trailer came out. 6 years ago my love for the transformers franchise was revamped and increased. And 6 years ago I saw this movie, my personal favorite of the franchise...the colors, the characters, everything was beautiful to me...I understand some people’s grievances about this movie, but personally this was the best movie I had seen, so much so that it inspired me to begin writing my own story about the transformers...unfortunately If I want to get it published advertised and such I’d have to change the characters and stuff to avoid copyright troubles. But the finer points don’t matter, I’m here to express my gratitude to those who worked so hard on this movie and to those who keep this franchise running. Thank you for inspiring generations and making some great content for the masses. Thank you for making this movie, it was an important part of my childhood and I most definitely would NOT be the same person I am today had this movie (and it’s predecessors and sequels) didn’t ever exist.",0,0,Silon One,ubGpDoyJvmI,0.3473958333333334,2020-04-30 19:04:19,False,False
