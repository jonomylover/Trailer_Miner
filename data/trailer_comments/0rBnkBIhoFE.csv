I have no problem with this as long as they do the same for ABC and NBC for spiking the Epstein and Weinstein stories because they were both big Democrat party donors and friends with the Clintons so ABC and NBC refused to cover the story.  That's not news, that's propaganda.  It's Democratic Party propaganda.  Intentionally not doing a story to protect the political party you align with because it will hurt that party is propaganda.  Just like it's propaganda to only do a positive story that helps the political party you align with and omit negative stories about that party.  You're intentionally pushing a false narrative and that's not news, that's propaganda, and the problem for the liberal mainstream media is that everyone in America has caught on to this now and that's why crap films like this will only appeal to the leftist Democrat base, which is less than 30% of the voting block of the U.S. elections.  This kind of dishonesty is exactly the kind of thing that pushes people away from the left and democrats, it's why the liberal media's ratings are in the toilet, it's why so many democrats woke up in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and voted for Trump.  It's one of the reasons Trump's approval ratings among blacks has skyrocketed and more and more blacks have walked away from the Democrat Party.  This crap is killing the Democrat party, it's pushing people away from them and only the die hards, their base, remain hanging on.  Hollywood and the liberals, the left, the progressives -- whatever you want to call them -- for a bunch of people who claim they hate Donald Trump more than anything, they sure as hell are doing everything they can to make sure he gets reelected in 2020.

It would be nice if they could just stick to the story without having to bash Fox News just because they are not a left leaning propaganda channel.  It's such a shame because pissing off half the country just reduces the appeal of their movies.  They just can't help themselves.  Many Republicans and Independents would probably like to see this movie but they know that the facts will be distorted be the far left leaning script writers who keep on bending the truths with more lies.  Never has anyone on Fox News said that ""minorities are criminals"".  Someone may have said that among the unvetted immigrants entering the country there may be some criminals among them.  That is NOT the same thing!  Words have consequences and the scriptwriters have most likely never even watched Fox News.  It's the evolution of gossip in the media that takes words out of context and interprets them with a completely different meaning, in the end.  I've watched the lying pundits on both sides and I'm not saying the right doesn't lie about what the left has to say but the right never injects political viewpoints in their movies. NEVER.  I've never seen a movie where the rich and successful guy is the good guy and the poor one is the bad guy.  In fact, ""Slumdog millionaire"",""Titanic"" and countless others won the Oscar!  The rich are always ""evil""...  The last movie was ""The Joker"" and I predict it will win an Oscar.
