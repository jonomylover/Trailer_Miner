Something could've been wrong with him or he was going crazy, which would later cause him to kill his own daughter. Secondly, as you can see during her first death, the killer seems to be much taller than her, which also may imply it's her father. Also, her friend said that the killer would know it was her birthday. Her father should have an idea of when she was born, right? And also, when she told that girl someone was going to. ""Kill her tonight"" she hid at home, and the person most likely to know where she lives is her father. The mother was never seen in any of this and the same goes for her dad.

2017-10-13T18:17:12,"I have come here to complain against this annoyance that is called 'happy death day'. I have received endless trailers for the movie for nearly a month now and am sick of it. The trailers have once again delivered essentially the entire plot in a mere fifteen second interval, leaving only the ""burning"" solution to this white-chicks predicament to be unraveled. Tell me, if you put a cover over a horses head but leave its body exposed, you can still clearly envision what the head looks like because of your previous familiarity with the physical form of the mammal, correct? The movie is uncreative, cringingly-comical, and not in any way frightening in the least bit. The main character is a chunga, the use of 50 cents in the club kills any mood of forbiddance, and the killer isn't profound or terrifying in any way. It looks retarded in that stupid baby mask. Its like someone took Ground-Hog Day, a poorly done mixtape, and Scream 4, shoved them into a blender, pissed in it, and dumped the remnants onto Michael Bays scrawny little lap for him to fondle with. I cant even tell if its supposed to be an actual slasher film, because it seems even more absurd than a more recent horror comedy (Get Out), minus the intentionality that is. And that's not the scary part. Its the audience willingness to pay money for the corporate regurgitations that's disheartening to the very soul. We are like blind dogs eating our own cinematic vomit.
