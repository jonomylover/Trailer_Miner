Martin Scorsese took a shot at it and decided against it. When the movie was released, I was disappointed. No character of Hardesty Maratta, no Jackson Mead - Master Bridge Builder of all time, were present in the film. The visual opportunities with the metaphor of the Bridge  of Light would have been spectacular. The magical sense of reality was mostly excised by writer/director Akiva Goldsman. The scene of Abby coming back to life left me in tears in the book. This movie scene, however, was devoid of any emotion. The screenplay was altered during writing as Goldsman's wife passed away, and he decided to do away with all story elements not directly connected to the love story between Peter Lake and Beverly Penn.

2020-03-29T03:37:18,"Some idjits gave this movie a bad review, even on USA Time because it isn't based on Shakespeare. Although Shakespeare's story is good, so is this,  they are not at all smart. Most people expect a nude, cussing and explosive movie. Sometimes it's movies like this that give some people dreams and hopes. To those idjits: remember thumper said if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all . It's a wonderful movie.",0,0,Kassandra Morgan,DBSj1MKwx6A,0.38571428571428573,2020-03-29 03:37:18,False,False
