Skip to -  23:39. I'm betting on the idea that if you stopped, you have at least some curiosity and hopefully an open mind. This video and this section in particular is about Dave Chappelle explaining why he went to Africa all those years ago. Some of you may have never heard about that or don't even know Chappelle. What is important is that he says that he can't talk about why he left directly so he explains it with a story. A story from a book. A story not unlike this plot. Try to ignore the jokes and the laughter. Try to remember that this is a story explaining why he went to Africa. If you're still with me, look up Patrice O'Neal and see what he said about owing someone. Something in someone's drink. Now, maybe the well is running dry on original ideas or action dramas have typical narratives that we see all the time.

I love the book(s) and can assure you this is neither Black Widow nor Atomic Blonde. Please read the book first if you want to judge this. Even if Black Widow might have been inspired by similar background the author of RS is an retired CIA officer and had his one sources and inspirations. Jennifer Lawrence is a great choice for Dominika and I think her working again with Francis Lawrence will be a huge success.

The movie wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be either.,1,0,BooBerry23,PmUL6wMpMWw,-0.007407407407407394,2020-05-29 07:57:08,False,False
