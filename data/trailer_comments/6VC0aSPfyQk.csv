He already strongly resembles Pac so ge shouldn't have to try so hard. A better director would have been able to address this. Benny Boom has a lot of experience as a ""video"" director not a ""film"" director. The choice to choose these scenes in the trailer is also a director approval. Which is concerning.  As far as looks i do find myself distracted by how much fuller of a face and stockier he seems to be than pac.  He also looks shorter.  But its too hard to find an exact replica.  I am hoping his performance in the overall film will help me get past that. If you watched Straight outta Compton Jason Mitchell didn't look nor sound exactly like Eazy E but was able to capture the essence of him so you didn't pat as much attention to it.  Thats because he turned out to be a strong actor and F gary Gray is an experienced Director.  I hope the film turns out better than the trailer.

Looks good but man Pac was a thug I know when he got with The Row he was wildin out and after being shot 5 times he got paranoid listen to the album In his own words by Pac interviewed by Sway and Tech when they were still in the Bay and it was 6 weeks before he died and got it when it first came out it has poems and a few unreleased songs by him and Tha Outlawz. Just listen to it and that's the real Pac towards the end and he sadly had a feeling it was gonna come again and it did about a month or so later. Still remember where I was when Power 106 announced he was shot cos I'm from Los Angeles and Pac imo is the G.O.A.T!

I know EDI and Noble both said they support this, but from what I see from these previews, is a portrayal of Tupac that is glorifying anger and material possessions. I see this Tupac as a man hungry for money and fame, that has random folks telling him he needs to know he was meant for greater. Get the fuck outta here with that. PAC was the one who KNEW his greatness, and KNEW that he needed to change the world. Pac's demons weren't something that he chased after, but were something that followed HIM.   I can't make my final thoughts until I see the movie, obviously. But even though I'm keeping an open mind, I can't shake the feeling that this shit is going to be a watered down, glorified soap opera of an angry black man fallen victim to ""hood life"" while chasing the white man's dream.

I can guarantee that this movie will not show you the poetic,smiling, great side of Tupac Amaru Shakur. I dont wanna go too deep into that black power, righteousness and the like but think about how when Black, Great leaders die, when the movie comes out about their lives they usually sugarcoat the good and expound heavily on the bad; destroying the image of not only the black person, but the people as a whole.

Tupac and his fellow gang members banged on another known gang member and later on that evening his gang retaliated against tupac's gang.

What I'm actually worried about is will this film do justice to Pac's realness and genius soul? I might be asking for a lot considering it's Hollywood but a Tupac biopic really needs to show the world how incredibly intelligent and compassionate this guy was, not the IDGAF gangsta image he resented the media for trying to make him out to be, that portrayal would be shallow af for such a person, I mean just look at his own definition of 'thug life' trust me you'll be surprised. Hopefully this gives a real insight into Pac's amazing mind and heart.

I feel that people need to understand that the whole east coast west coast feud was a big media thing and to show what was really going behind the scenes from all important/ critical vantage points. I mean yes people can do more research on the internet but in this modern age what better way then to put it in a movie to inflict interest of a situation to an audience, influencing them to go and do more of their own research. It was a big event just like the Rodney king trials, O.J. Simpson trials, L.A. Riots, Police brutality back in the 80s-90s, etc.  I mean look at the show, ""American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson"", I was alive during that time yet I paid no attention to it but I heard about it and knew alittle about what it was, yet I never took interest in it until the show came out and when I started seeing how the show was a big deal on media, before I watched the show myself I did my research first and watched the whole trial on YouTube and watched the first movie that came out about O.J. Simpson and then I watched the show and saw the things that were happening behind the scenes that you didn't get to see in the news unless you were actually there. Yes a few things were off in the show but the concept and idea and knowledge on the bit of American history was very educational to me and made me see things from a different light.
