2018-02-05T01:50:43,"Okay I have a few more problems with where this movie is going:  1) The plot is becoming convoluted. It's gone from ""the island is exploding and we need to evacuate it, also let's find Blue"" to ""also there's this evil corporation trying to do ...something... a la InGen in TLW:JP, and apparently they've engineered a new raptor-rex terror hybrid like in the last film."" An action-adventure film with a convoluted plot is hard to follow and kinda off-putting. 2) This is starting to feel same-y. Not only do they have the corporate plan element from The Lost World and the hybrid from JW, but visually it's also very similar to the last film ‚Äì right down to featuring that hamster wheel thing again. 3) The Marvel humour is creeping in. Somehow I don't think that's gonna fit the tone of a film called ""Fallen Kingdom"" but by all means. 4) It bears repeating that the dinosaurs in the original film weren't monsters, just animals. You could get away with the monster element with the I-rex in JW because it was sort of a failed genetic experiment, and that was like the point of the film, but here the focus is on the island exploding and yet you're bringing the horror element back anyway. It just kinda feels cheap and out of place here.  I know I'm probably complaining a bit too much about a film that I have no intention of seeing in theatres, but I feel invested nonetheless because of my affinity for the original film and by extension its IP which you are using here. If this were a no-name original property I wouldn't care to express my opinion, but when you use the Jurassic name to increase your box office draw, just know that you will be hearing from the likes of me.",0,0,Matt William,NooW_RbfdWI,0.07307137307137307,2018-02-05 01:50:43,True,True
2018-02-05T01:50:59,"If I had to imagine a fight between blue and the indoraptor it would be like this (my version takes place in a large room with windows)  1. the two size each other up and share a few growls.  2. blue attacks and leaps on the indoraptor biting and clawing at it  3. Owen,Claire,and Lucy arrive just as the indoraptor shakes blue off and pins blue to the ground continuously biting at her neck and clawing her sides  4. Owen pulls out his rifle and shoots the indoraptor in the leg injuring it and giving blue enough time to recover   5. Owen runs frantically around Lockwood manner to distract the indoraptor   6. the indoraptor catches up to Owen and smacks him with it's right arm while simultaneously slashing his chest with the claws on its left arm  7. the indoraptor exhausted from fighting blue and chasing Owen slowly circles Owen similar to many predatory animals and seconds later lunges at Owen with tremendous speed  8. Just split seconds before getting to Owen, blue rams the indoraptor full speed knocking the indoraptor off balance  9. off in the distance everybody hears the hooting noise of a dilophosaurus as two dilos rush in to help  10. one dilophosaurus is instantly killed by the indoraptors powerful jaws as the other spits its venom at the indoraptor   11. Blue leaps onto the nearly blinded  indoraptor's back while the dilophosaurus bites the indoraptor's neck and face  12. Waking up from being unconscious Owen grabs his rifle and shoots the indoraptor in it's left eye blinding it as the indoraptor let's out a screech of pain  13. Now enraged the indoraptor violently shakes off both blue and the dilophosaurus and wipes the dilo venom from its right eye and begins to thrash in every direction with its head ,arms,and tail   14. Blue runs and kicks the indoraptor with such force that it knocks the indoraptor into a window where it falls to its death.",1,0,Hybrid ext,NooW_RbfdWI,0.006845238095238088,2018-02-05 01:50:59,True,True

2018-02-05T02:07:33,"Ok, I've seen a lot of people messing up the dinosaurs in the movie, specifically 2. The Indoraptor, which is in the house scene, is different than the baryonyx, which is in the pipe scene with the fire/lava, and for those that say it looks a little like a spinosaurus, the 2 are genetically related, like how dogs are very similar and share many attributes, but are also very different. Baryonyx is a real dino, and the indoraptor is a hybid that is similar to the indominus rex. My assumption is that the Indoraptor has the base Genome of a velociraptor, while the indominus rex, as stated in the first jurassic world, has the base genome of a tyranosauraus Rex, aka T-Rex. The Indoraptor may have other mutations and/or features specifically added to its dna from other things, but we are not sure yet.",77,19,Pokecraft King,NooW_RbfdWI,-0.05583333333333334,2018-02-05 02:07:33,True,True

Too many ex machinas, too many plot holes that will be inexplicable except by fans that need to explain it so they don't feel as bad about liking the movie, too much in your face exposition, and for God sake, just get rid of the hybrid dinosaurs. They're not necessary at all. They're just a lazy story-teller's tool.

Your movies have no impact, they're forgettable except the title, and the characters are so 1 dimensional, it's disgusting.

But my peers and family members say that it is not appropriate for my age, is immature, childish, not productive, is the reason why I‚Äôm friendzoned by girls, is making me behind kids my age group, and is the reason why I am so out of this world and why I am ‚Äúdetached from reality.‚Äù I put that in parenthesis because I do not believe that I am detached from reality. I believe that I‚Äôm just being myself. There was this dude recently in high school who told me that if I want a gf, I have to be a real man by getting my mind off those things, play sports, instead of being a beta male Asian with quirky interests. I posts pictures on Instagram of my artwork on prehistoric animals in their respective time periods and Ive also done artworks on early dogs, giraffes, horses and whales. But many of my friends unfollowed me. I asked them why and they said its because Instagram is not for posting artwork. They said its more for posting college pictures and pictures of your friends. And they told me that those artworks did not make them feel like they could relate to my life anymore so they unfollowed me. And they suggested to me that I should quit Instagram because Instagram is not for me. My aunt makes false accusations out of me to her friends and says that I post my artworks on social media just to impress people, get their approval, and that I‚Äôm an attention seeker. I can assure you none of that about me is true! I was really hurt of what happened and it is still taking me a while to recover. I asked myself if I‚Äôm weird and less interesting. And I felt as if my heart was smashed by a big hammer and I felt as if I‚Äôm not accepted by the social circle of society. I considered those friends who unfollowed me to be really good friends. Some of them I knew since grade school. But I guess they changed a lot.

This is sooo much better than just the stupid albino rex  (even if it's technically the same idea) ... but have you seen the design ... so awesome and if done right it could actually add that horror movie feeling you could hope for when you hear Bayona. Great that he actually delivers, even with one of the biggest mainstream movie franchise that is currently out there. Hope the studio allowed him to make the whole fallen kingdom a bit more mature / gave him some liberties  .. well at least we have the confirmation that it's actual going to be dark.  Have to say I didn't 100% like Jurassic World in retrospect but this looks soooo great.

In hindsight, I can see cloning regilar dinos in the Jurassic Park universe making sense, you're tampering with anything(except the gender, last I recall).

So using both of these and apply them to the indoraptor and you'll have yourself the ultimate killing machine. Those rich people in suits wanted this because they know they can profit from the war.

2018-02-05T07:30:46,(My Prediction...)  So basically the island is collapsing and they gotta get some dinosaurs out.  But in the shadows the Island's scientists take another attempt at genetically modifying and creating another dinosaur to attract visitors and investors so they can invest in a new island for a new park.  But surprise the dinosaur gets released and probably kills it's Creator but miraculously attempts to specifically murder Chris Pratt's kid.  But luckily Chris Pratt saved the Velociraptor with the blue line down it's body [that somehow remembers that it was raised by Chris however many years prior] and it saves Chris Pratt's family but somehow dies in the process.

2018-02-05T12:26:55,"Authors Note;  I am writing this novel because I am a fan of Sesame Street VS Spider-Man MEETS Super Mario Bros. VS The Simpsons. However its become clear to me that the creators of it have got some things wrong and clearly don't care about making it good. I am talking mostly of ""the problem"" with Toadsworth and Mario.Also a lot of the sex is censored with many of the intercourse's that happened edited out completely.(ie, Toadsworth and Unstopable Serenity Darkmoon Raven having boning time, that time with Toadsworth doing it with Mario Mario and Harry watching, etc.)      This fic is my attempt to correct that. By supporting this fic I hope to get a group of elite Sesame Street VS Spider-Man MEETS Super Mario Bros. VS The Simpsons writers working with this new canon and to establish this as the truth of what actually happened. Hopefully the original creators will see the demand and make this official.  Perhaps even pay us because we are fixing their mistakes. If you wish to join my new canon, feel free to write your own story but you must submit it to me for approval. You can use my email ;   theRealSesame Street VS Spider-Man MEETS Super Mario Bros. VS The Simpsonswriter@gattormail.com You can also send constructive reviews there, but no petty criticisms. If I get motivations muddled,its because my cat distracted me.  Also, if you don't like my story you don't have to have read it.   Anyway, and now on with my superior story of how things actually happened; In the beginning there was The Letter E its legendary power surrounded in mystery...   Unstopable Serenity Darkmoon Raven was taking a shower this hot day.  She was naked, enjoying the water dripping over her wet, naked body. She was washing the blood off her body from the recent monsters she had just killed. ...the water smoothly rolled over her firm breasts. The blood driped off like  whipped cream in the ocean. ...the water dripping down her Cunt. ""OwwwhhhOwwhhh"" she said from the pleasure; She had just finnished  doing Drabbling using a bee hive. She was dreaming of Marios manly lance pulsating inside her. She was also singing ""A Whole New World"" at the top of her voice  Then, suddenly, Mario paraglided in. ""Sorry I have to interupt you, naked in the shower, but we must go!""  ""What? im taking a shower, Im naked, cant you see that?""  the plumber Jr. could see that she was completely naked in the shower. ""yes, I can see that you are naked, in the shower"" Mario said.  ""But we must go...Green Goblin is back!.""  ""What not Norman Osborn!!!"" she punched the wall out of her deep inner range. ""Yes!""  ""Oh!""  Unstopable Serenity Darkmoon Raven got out of the shower and put some clothes onher hot steaming naked body.She wore a dress the same color as her eyes her father brought her from the city. After she was no longer naked, they left to defeat Green Goblin.  Along the way they summoned Harry, who joined them on their quest.  ""I will join you on your quest to defeat Green Goblin said Harry Osborn.  ""Thanks for joining us on our quest,"" said Mario; ""Yes, we need your help to defeat Green Goblin"" said Unstopable Serenity Darkmoon Raven. So, Unstopable Serenity Darkmoon Raven Mario and now Unstopable Serenity Darkmoon Raven left by terrain wagon for their epic quest to defeat the prince of all uglyness ...... Norman Osborn!  Over the next few days, more and more horrific reports came from the direction of Norman Osborn's hanger.  First it was just the criminals being arrested and put to work in Green Goblin's armies. Then anyone who was against Green Goblin was also arrested and put to trial. They were separated into groups of men and women. The men were put to work, the women were rapped until killed. Green Goblin looked down on his works. He then petted his thingy. Oh yes, Green Goblin was ready for Mario now.  (A/N I know I had a lot of people rapped in this story, but I was trying to stay realistic to the time period. Lots of people were rapped back then. Not just women, but it was common as a woman to be rapped and killed back then. That's just business studies.) And when everyone was ready to go, suddenly, the door opened!  ""????!!"" questioned Mario exclaimingly. Because in the doorway, no other than Norman Osborn stood! And lightning struck int he background and showed villain as a silluette.  But instead Green Goblin's usual smirk, there was confusion on his face! ""Who.... who am I?"" mutered Norman Osborn ""Who are you?!"" Mario Mario said. ""Who *is* he?!"" Betty also said (a/n lol she aint very smart lol). ""Who... who am I?"" Green Goblin repeated... ""I don't know who I am!"" ""Zomg, Green Goblin lost his memory!"" concluded Harry smartly.  ""Indeed, that is the only logical explanation,"" said Super Mario, who of course had thought of it before Harry did but was too noble and modest to say so.     ""Well, I say we kill him now."" said Toadsworth. ""That is a good idea,"" said Mario and he reached for his howdah pistol.  But then all the sudden, they were surrounded! By Green Goblin's Loyal followerss! ""Lord!"" they said. ""We have brought you the The Letter E!"" The The Letter E! Mario Mario saw it within the hands of the security gaurd. As ever as revoking as it always had been.  If only Mario could get to it! Then Mario remembered... He had the power of go karting!  Before Green Goblin could turn to the loyal followers, Mario lept forward and grabbed the The Letter E from mercenarys's hands. Mario then apologised profoundly and patted the loyal followers on their back. ""Green Goblin,"" said Mario, ""I'm sorry, but it's better for you never ever to remember who you were."" And with Super Mario's Stomping, he crushed the The Letter E. ""Noooooo!"" Norman Osborn said, ""Now I will never know who I am!""  ""Well, I'm not going to let you get away with all the misery you've caused!"" yelled Toadsworth. He grabbed a lazer gun and smashed Green Goblin's head open.  For a moment, Green Goblin looked confused... and the said: ""But I... I don't know what I did wrong!"" And he died. And everyone applauded, even the lackys because despite Green Goblin having lost his memory, the evil was still inside them. Ready to come out.

We''re seeing the dino cages being transported, Helicoptors and snipers/trex, brachiosaurus (people staring up at it), TRex stopping another dino before it eats our heroes.. Velociraptor tapping. - I'm not complaining as i am excited for the film but these were moments that made the originals fun to watch. The new trilogy needs its own material and shouldn't be re-doing whats already been shown!! I just hope it doesn't turn into a Alien/Jurassic horror film. It needs to be Dark and thrilling but keep that spark of the Jurassic Franchise. They really need to remove that guys high pitched scream from the trailer it just seems like forced comedy.

I no longer feel ""The Fallen Kingdom"" as a movie in the series, it does not have that same air of warmth and care that had its predecessor now feels more like an excuse to return to get another movie.

That part with the little girl and the dinosaur looks pretty terrifying and it looks like we may have a scene where those suits will be eaten by that dinosaur. I mean in the past we've had soldiers and scientists and I'm sick to death of it. I mean granted these guys are probably close to the creation of the dinosaurs but it's still the closes thing. But I still have doubts. I don't like the ""chemistry"" between Owen and Claire and seeing as how they're split up I dread at the constant bickering. Seriously did they have to get together in the last movie. If you have and main male and main female you don't have to put them together. Dr Grant and Dr Sattler didn't get together and they had better chemistry than Owen and Claire. Also that new Dino doesn't look very impressive. It just looks like a giant raptor like the Indominous.

2018-02-05T21:24:52,"While this new dino DOES share many similarities to a raptor, it is clearly much bigger than it. I personally believe it to be a baryonyx, a different type of theropod that was capable of swimming long distances, and primarily hunted fish. Think spinosaur, but smaller and not the massive dorsal fin on its back. This type of dinosaur would make sense, considering that the island itself is crumbling due to a volcano, and since its an island obviously surrounded by water, the baryonyx could profit from this type of environment. Especially considering the scene where they fall off the edge into the ocean in one of those gyro-ball things(whatever they called them in the last movie), the baryonyx could easily hunt that kind of thing down.",0,0,Jack Lacey,NooW_RbfdWI,0.1077300785634119,2018-02-05 21:24:52,True,True

2018-02-05T22:27:01,"A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?"" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. ""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",0,0,Broccollipop,NooW_RbfdWI,0.11157232704402517,2018-02-05 22:27:01,True,True

Pause the video at 0.58 and try and tell me you will honestly give a fuck if and when this clown dies? Secondly, Spielberg's revolutionary use of ANIMATRONICS was far more convincing than any terrible CGI ever could be. For further reference, see the difference between the original Alien film (man in a suit, ie. an actual physical thing running around) and that puddle of phlegm that was Alien Covenant (cgi bullshit). CGI is ruining films. There's no artistic integrity left any more. Just greed and cost-cutting. No one will ever bother to build the phenomenal movie sets or creatures of old ever again.

2018-02-06T00:44:05,"Pretty solid trailer over all. The destruction of the island/s is long overdue  and if this franchise is to grow in any real meaningful way its got to step out of babypen.  Genetically altered dinosaurs have been part of the core foundation of this series so weaponized dinosaurs was another thing we were going to come to eventually. Really while to perfect, the premiss has been handled very well so far  On the subject of saving the dinosaurs (SPOILERS) from what I can find out while it billed as a rescue mission to save them in reality its just so INGEN can sell them off. Likely with the fall of JK and all the lawsuits, they are currently prohibited from cloning new dinosaurs for public use until everything's cleared up. So with no new parks on the horizon they are just out to get back the ""property"" and profit off of it as best they can. (SPOILERS END)  As for the Indoraptor, I'm baffled by people asking ""why make another monster you cannot control?"". Well why wouldn't they? The Indominus Rex was nothing but a prototype, an early stage experimental bio-weapon built under the cover a new park attraction. It was never the final product. In fact it's little rampage could be looked as an accidental  ""Field Test"". It single  handedly brought down Jurassic Kingdom, a facility designed to contain such a creature, displayed incredible abilities and adaptability and to top it off it overcame almost every single human attempt to capture or kill it. If that's not pretty dame good data to show investors  that am more refined and controllable version of such a weapon is worth a buy I don't know what is.

But Spielberg probably felt he needed to further drive home the point that it was a JP movie and sequel. Also in the actual movie Hammond tells Jeff Golblum's character that Island Sorna was ""the factory floor"" and not meant to be another park island and yet the movie is titled JURASSIC PARK ....even though the only park alluded to in the movie is an opera house that originally planned to be constructed to be the original park but never reached completion....so there you have it,NO park there yet we have the JP title.  Moving on to Jurassic PARK 3: we are brought back to scenic Isla Sorna and it looks like INGEN(or is it NGEN?) has been up to no good constructing their own compound and putting up fences to attempt to contain dinosaurs,but throughout the movie we don't see any evidence supporting INGEN/NGEN having any plans for visitors??? Hmmm what's going on here??  I don't see a park here....more like a dog pound for dinosaurs because a big overreaching company tried to setup their OWN operation on the island and FAILED.....so once again NO park here,and yet again we have the JP title,which only serves to show this is a 2nd but non-book related,sequel  That in mind,why the sequel title Jurassic WORLD when this ACTUAL park is DESTROYED? The ORIGINAL Jurassic Park served to show Hammond's dream of people AACTUALLY coming to a PARK to see live dinosaurs....and Jurassic World is set apart from this movie to show us 20 years later another new,but ACTUAL park got built(and apparently as referenced in the movie actually was just fine for some time) and this park was named Jurassic WORLD thus we get the WORLD title there.   But again,this same park is in RUINS yet still the WORLD title??? We can all understand this is a SEQUEL,but the park is destroyed so why not the PARK title here???  Come on guys!!! Still PLENTY of time to be smart and change the title!!!",0,0,AdamAddictL,NooW_RbfdWI,0.1601466163255936,2018-02-06 06:17:55,True,True

Scary music (or none at all, which is usually better) + dino shadows + scared people + dino reveal + slow creeping + scuffle to escape = recipe for a Jurassic cliche. I'm not saying the build up and effects weren't great. It looks well done. I'm simply saying I've been over-exposed to every cliche the Jurassic movies have come out with, so they don't affect me as much. ^^; But we're just here to see dinos, right? :)  Also, have they gone so far as to make Blue a family pet? Seems like it based on the setting. I hope not, because that's just as dumb as trusting a group of raptors won't turn on you just because you trained and raised them. It's the same reason you shouldn't keep wild animals as pets, even if you raised it from birth. They have instincts. They even kill their own kind if they have to.

In the lost World (I have less information because this is the trailer for Jurassic world 2) they bring a Trex to (forgot the name of the city) and a man says some stuff and BOOM a Trex comes out of the boat.

2018-02-06T21:31:25,"Sadly looks terrible. Can we please stop adding indominous to the beginning of every dinosaur , just to try and come up with some crappy storyline and just stick with the original ones. It seems as if they have to put indominous infront of everything because they have turned normal dinosaurs into pets! Blue? seriously yeah mate meet my allogator pink ranger, she's so friendly I reared her from an egg and she always uses her massive jaws to rip apart anyone who tries to mess with me. Seriously, these are prehistoric animals with a prehistoric brain, they definitely would not be tamed, just like you can't tame a flipping crocodile. Speilberg made the raptors scary in jp, and the t-rex scene was awesome. And for anyone who thinks im being a buzz kill, the idea for indominous dino's were just an idea they came up with because it took them years to think of a half decent storyline after they scrapped the idea to give the dinosaurs guns! Come to think of it that may have been better than this crap. Most of us just want big scary normal dino's like from the first film, running wild in the park, causing mayhem, eating tourists, chasing people intertwined with an interesting plot with some suspense, not hybrid dino half crab, half sheep, half cat, half meerkat, that they decide to splice the DNA with. I don't want scary indo dinosaurs I want scary scary dinosaurs. The first jw was weak at best, the visuals were mostly CGI and not even a patch on the visuals from jp over 20 years ago! and they gave the helm to trevorrow who had only done one indie film prior to it. Guaranteed hadcore fans of jp will be disappointed and I think if Crichton were still alive, he would be pissed that his franchise has been butchered. I was really hoping even after the mess of jw, they might be able to turn it around, but I am soooooo dissapointed.",0,0,nicholasp1987,NooW_RbfdWI,-0.029800724637681165,2018-02-06 21:31:25,True,True

We can distract ourselves with social media and mindless entertainment, but it doesn't change the fact that we're all getting fucked over by the corrupt people we put in office. It's time for a revolution. The Founding Fathers told us that if the US government ever became to us what Great Britain was to them, the American people had a right and duty to overthrow and replace their government with something new. We're long over due for that change. It's time for a revolution. If all of the 11 million people who viewed this video marched on Washington and demanded change, we'd get it.

2018-02-07T18:56:17,"But why?¬†  Great effects, but practical effects would make it more believable... this makes it look unreal. Movies like this should be made with more practical effects, so that you won't have to stick giant filter over the entire film to make it look more scary and seem like it has awesome explosions. It is not believable.. colors are so ""off"" from the real world that it hurts.. and that is what ruins so many movies these days. When I don't get the feeling that this actually exists, it ceases to be scary. Colors shouldn't ""pop"" like that. It's like those horrible DC Comics movies, never learning from Marvel that to make a superhero believable.. the colors need to be right, more ""true"" to what you want the real world to be. I also still don't get why they have gone from terrifying dinosaurs that all wants you dead.. to, lets train them like pets and breed some mutant hybrid thingies to make the movie a bit more scary since people don't find tame things scary. It is like thinking ""yeah, lets train tigers.. they will be completely tame, I promise... until they suddenly don't get enough food, or get bored with you one day, and eat you.. cause you are their pet as well"".",6,3,Aleksander Hoff,NooW_RbfdWI,0.04694940476190476,2018-02-07 18:56:17,True,True

Also don't get me wrong, I don't hate the original Jurassic parks, they were actually amazing! But sadly Jurassic world wasn't great, and if a producer of Fallen Kingdom park reads this, don't make any big mistakes like you did in the last one, try better editing and better plot line, I mean the last one there was a giant door! What was that for! And in this trailer the dinosaurs have to much human character! you could of least make them act like dinosaurs, and one thing I don't like about modern films is they make it way to dramatic, I mean, don't make it not dramatic at all, just make it not dramatic, if it is to dramatic it just makes it not dramatic, like the lighting overall at the start of the trailer, I just feel like people try to hard. I would of made the kid hide under his covers and hold his breath, and not just make a dinosaur appear out of know were, I would of made the kid run out of breath and then take a deep breath or something and give him a more kiddish act of what a kid would do. and give away his hiding spot, and not have the dinosaur about too walk out the room at the perfect time as he takes a breath, and maybe have a single night light on and not a blue light and have the dinosaur dribble or something, I mean I wouldn't make that to dramatic by the way. just a little feedback Fallon Kingdom team.

With Star Wars on the decline and this series continuing to do well it is now my favorite franchise for sure.  Now as for the film I think either Blue or Rexy will die. I don't want any of them to die, but that isn't always good writing to have everyone to start predictably being ok each movie so it is conflicting. The Indoraptor seems similar in size to the Carnotaurus, this could draw an interesting parallel if the T-Rex had much more trouble with a creature of similar size. I think they both could kill each other. The T-Rex realistically would kill it in one bite.

No one will ever truly top the actual original film, but I really like this direction. It looks like they're going up instead of down or sideways, which exactly what we want in sequels. It harkens back to the good part of The Lost World where dinosaurs escape into the modern city and cause chaos, while also using the better atmosphere of the third film in the original trilogy that tried to be more horror-esque. Here's hoping it trims the fat and doesn't feel like the worse parts about those two awful films. Despite being a fan favorite, The Lost World was a complete mess filled with obnoxious plotholes, annoying characters and and a total lacking of the original spirit of the first film. The third film was just stupid despite a few interesting ideas, and if anything, felt more like a good episode of some TV show than a AAA movie.   Ultimately I really like what they look like they're doing here.

And the grey thing at the bottom left is probably the thing on the helicopter (the things on the bottom that help it land) meaning that the T-rex is jumping up at a helicopter. Then if we go to 1:16 we see the T-rex roaring at the helicopter. So what I think is happening is the main antagonists are running from the T-rex and there is a helicopter waiting for them.

2018-04-15T02:35:50,"I wish I had high expectations but I don't. The only two Jurassic Park movies I think were truly worthwhile were the originals, written by Crichton and then adapted for the silver screen. Both movies had compelling, realistic characters and plots that were action-packed and modestly thoughtful. The last few installments in the series have missed the ""Might of Nature"" motif and incorporated a gross amount of CGI and needless melodrama.   Definitely still going to watch Fallen Kingdom -- I'm just hoping, desperately, that the director and screenwriters can bring back the magic.",0,0,Ryan J,NooW_RbfdWI,0.028444444444444456,2018-04-15 02:35:50,True,True

This new hybrid has given me the chills, and has inspired me in my drawings. Everyday in school, I search for scrap paper, get a pencil, go to the library and draw the Indo Raptor. This dinosaur has an amazing look, a kind of look that makes you automatically know it will kill you without a second thought. I can‚Äôt wait for Jurassic World 3 (it would be cool if the next one was called Jurassic Kingdom) and would be thrilled if Owen and Claire were in it. Oh, and Blue. I hope for ANOTHER HYBRID. AGAIN. It would be amazing to see a new hybrid. Maybe the Indo Raptor‚Äôs DNA to be fused with a Dilophosaurus‚Äôs and a Utahraptor. Maybe the next hybrid will have FEATHERS?
