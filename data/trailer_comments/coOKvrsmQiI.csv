2017-11-17T01:52:00,"Alright, here's my initial impressions: First, they're clearly taking this WAY too seriously, and second, why they gotta screw up the central concept every time they put the Rock in a video game movie?  First they make Doom about a nonsense genetic virus instead of a demon invasion, then they make Jumanji a video game instead of a board game, and now this.  Rampage was about PEOPLE who had been mutated into giant monsters.  The Hell kind of adaptation is this if there isn't going to be a scene when the monsters are defeated and they shrink back down into naked folks shuffling away while awkwardly covering themselves?  That was the most memorable part of the whole game!  It's not like there was much of a plot in the first place, but they couldn't even preserve that tiny little shred of a story thread?  Yeah, I shouldn't really care, but I played this game as a little kid, and I was kind of enthusiastic about this.  And this just seems... so... generic.  Seems to me this should've been a Wreck-It Ralph style animated feature about three people who get turned into monsters and go on the run while trying to control their urge to smash buildings.  They could've had the monsters talk, tell some dumb jokes, sold some dolls, made a new game, everybody wins.  But no, we get a cookie-cutter big monster disaster film that looks like something the SyFy channel cooked up.  Well, maybe it'll be good.  It's highly doubtful, but who knows?  It could still be a breakout hit.  And who knows, maybe the weaselly government guy is going to turn into the lizard monster.  Or was the lizard a woman?  Well, whatever.  That could be kind of... something.  I guess.  Maybe I'm aiming high.",0,0,Joe England,coOKvrsmQiI,0.025832685832685824,2017-11-17 01:52:00,True,True

(No offense Brad Peyton.) Some may say that it's because good directors don't want to waste their talent, but it's directors like these that can give these movies what they usually lack, substance. If great directors like the ones mentioned above directed these movies, they could give whole new meanings to the franchises they represent, attract newcomers to the games, and make an impact on audiences. These movies have a lot of potential, but they need to be put into the right hands. I'm sure Brad Peyton will have his breakthrough film someday. Who knows, maybe this will be it when it's released.

First off, they were humans who worked for a company who's chemicals ended up turning them into giant creatures  George the Gorilla, Ralph the Wolf, and Lizzie the Lizard. Their goal other than destroying everything was to get revenge on the evil company that did it to them. The arcade and N64 games were pretty amazing, but the sequel to those was a real let down, and eventually Midway shut down and their IP's were bought by Warner Bros.   The graphics in the games had them as pretty animated and cartoony in a twisted dark sort of way, so to see them made all realistic for hollywood with a focus on The Rock vs the focus being on the monsters, is pretty disappointing.",0,2,JNR,coOKvrsmQiI,-0.0705246913580247,2017-11-17 03:59:38,True,True

Why do these hypocrites like these morality plays and then consistently fail to live up to the messages they try to convey?

But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer.

The main character is basically king kong but the wolf being a friend is actually interesting and even has a pretty nice design.  The croc also looks kool but the way they reveal it at the trailer is obvious its going for a Godzilla approach. IDK much about the game but im sure it was inspired by big G. However i could careless about them cashing in if it didn't look like the same fucking formula for every giant monster movie now. Its Tranformers its Skull island its Godzilla its the same movie we already seen about 80 times but this time its more of a comedy and has a sweet wolf.,0,0,StraightEdgeRaptor,coOKvrsmQiI,0.06858054226475278,2017-11-18 23:30:28,True,True

The monsters, a gorilla, a werewolf and a lizard (like Godzilla) were 100 foot tall beasts.  But these monsters were genetically altered humans.

2017-11-19T05:18:04,"So, lemme get this straight:  RAMPAGE: A Midway arcade classic arcade game (and one of my personal favorites) is finally getting to the big screen.  I have a few questions here:  1. Who was the person who decided that this particular arcade game should be one of the first to have a stand alone movie, rather than PAC-MAN, DIG-DUG, GALAGA, or even DONKEY KONG for that matter? Does Sony own the copyrights to those games being that they were mentioned in that horrible “Pixels”? Or is it more like a dart board kinda scenario? Like the director of this movie LITERALLY blindfolded themselves and just threw a dart at a board that said “CLASSIC ARCADE GAME MOVIE IDEAS”. Discuss.  2. I understand that adaptations from video games to movies must have SOME changes, I get that. But they couldn’t even stick with the one key material that the monsters were all originally human that turned into monsters? Why does it have to be animals? Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against it, I’m just curious.  3. I’m not saying Dwayne is a bad actor, but I feel like they could’ve done better with the lead casting roll. In my personal opinion, I just feel as if Dwayne is a little. . .i dunno, a little overused I guess? He’s a mediocre actor at best, and I just feel like they’re kinda wearing him out. Again, that’s just my opinion.  But overall, I see a plus and minus in just this trailer alone.  The +: The parts with George and Ralph (Ralph is the wolf’s name btw) destroying through the town looked pretty cool and promising. Even with the little hint at Lizzie (the LIZZARD, not a croc) at the end. My favorite part overall of the original game was having monsters wreak havoc across cities as brothers in arms, rather than enimies. Imagine if King Kong and Godzilla teamed up to fight an even greater enemy than themselves? That sounds like an awesome idea if you ask me.  The -: The story revolving around Dwayne and the other human characters. Here’s the thing you must remember; the game Rampage has a very simple plot:  - 3 ordinary people get turned into monsters, and now wreak havoc all across the world. That’s basically about it.  Boom, that’s it. It’s not too complex, and not really that hard to follow. SO DONT TRY TO MAKE SOME COMPLEX RIDICULOUS BULLSHIT STORY THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MONSTERS, BUT THE HUMANS THAT HAVE TO STOP THEM.  I came here to see MONSTERS DESTROY THINGS AND EAT PEOPLE. AND SOMETIMES FLY ON PLANES AND VOMIT ON EACH OTHER (Play the Rampage N64 version, quality shit right there). But you get what I’m trying to say. GIVE US WHAT THE GAME WAS GLORIOUS FOR.   Overall: As far as it looks now with just one trailer, it’s a 50/50 chance that I might try to go see it. I saw Pixels, and I regretting it after Cuburt was SPEAKING FUCKING ENGLISH.  Please, don’t go that direction, I beg you.",0,1,Hero Hitman64,coOKvrsmQiI,-0.009944581280788175,2017-11-19 05:18:04,True,True

2017-11-19T19:43:41,"Fuck this rip-off, nothing beats the original, The Rock is such a juiced up fake actor but suddenly he’s been coming out with movie after movie while talented actors who don’t have big muscles like The Rock get left in the dust by directors. Honestly I can picture the entire film right now from start to finish with the same corny jokes and Kevin Hart being short being thrown around, that Arnold and danny de vito formula used over and over. These guys are just taking your money for bullshit films making them richer.   Its so obvious, The Rock tries too hard to come across as a humble giant but its complete horse shit he acts the way he does on camera with a fake image because he knows it’ll get him into people’s hearts. I loved the Rock in Wrestling and his earliest movies like Welcome To The Jungle , Walking Tall etc until he turned into a complete fuckin sell out rubbing baby oil on his body and looking for any excuse to take his shirt off in films. He’s become the equivalent of a nude girl being eye candy in films. Seriously guy needs to take a serious acting role for once in a good movie, he could make a good action hero but he keeps going for easy rolls. He’s got nothing on the likes of Arnold, he never sold out and would’ve crushed The Rocks peaunt head under his massive biceps. Rant Over.

2017-11-20T06:46:37,"This kinda reminds me of one of my favorite SNES video games back in the 90s called Primal Rage. It's a fighting game of dinosaurs and other creatures who were awoken when a meteor hit the world, but there are still humans living, the world then is named Urth and the humans have all been divided into 7 clan, each one treating each monster as their god. So the gameplay of primal rage is that these 7 monsters are fighting each other to see who will rule the world. And for some strange reason this trailer kinda reminds me of the game, since both this movie and the game has these gorilla characters, and there are more monsters that are gonna like fight each other. Another huge difference is that the humans from the movie are the ones who will also fight against the giant animal mutants. I really find this movie interesting! I may possibly watch it when it comes out on dvd. Sometimes i really wish there was an actual Primal Rage movie! That would be great! ^^",1,0,fire miracle,coOKvrsmQiI,0.1,2017-11-20 06:46:37,True,True

2017-11-21T00:41:49,"God, I remember this wii game, shaking the controller furiously like one would shake an asthmatic child who was in the middle of an attack, and whose owner was not in sight, it was fun. You could battle against other players, or work together to unlock new characters. My personal favorite was the giant fuck-off crab monster, now when I say crab monster, I obviously mean squid, for these developers never took any risk, and simply sat in the puddle of piddle and shit created by their own ineptitude for creativity. While all fun and good, I completely forgot about the game until the trailer for the movie, and in doing so, remembered the core aspect of the game, you and your friends, because let’s face it, the single player was shite, destroy, or rampage, see what I did there, aren’t I oh so clever, through various cities, fighting the army, and faffing around with your older siblings for one glorious moment where you are the gorilla, and he is the underpowered wolf, who is inferior in all ways. You achieve this moment of bliss right before he whacks you on your head, and picks you upside down, being drawn out of any sense of enjoyment you once had. Now this movie looks nothing like the game it was based off of, and in my opinion, and this could just be the blood rushing down to my brain, but I feel like I’d much rather see two giant fuck-off monsters battling, bathing in the visceral carnage of the city, and playing around with tanks as if they were your mom’s special toys.",0,0,Toka Dune,coOKvrsmQiI,0.03422463551773896,2017-11-21 00:41:49,True,True

Heres where they went wrong George (player 1 / ape) was a scientist that was exposed to a toxin in a new vitamin Lizzie (player 2 / lizard) was a woman that discovered a radioactive lake Ralph (player 3,/ wolf) was a food tester that ate a contaminated additive  They go into a primal rage during their time as a beast . Only for it to ware off after the bidy sustains a large amound of damage. In the game the military use non lethal rounds to subdue the creatures. ( Mainly because when they are defeated they turn  human and walk off the screen humiliated.   The movie looks good. But if it was supposed to tell the story of rampage. Rather than a very loose based movie.  Hollywood seems to be very loosely making movies.  I think i could be a hollywood writer and director if i make a movie loosly based on making a movie .

According to producers, real animals from the infamous Birds & Animals Unlimited (BAU) were used on set.   BAU, operated by Hollywood animal trainer Gary Gero, provides animals for use in film, television, and advertisements. BAU has rented out animals to hundreds of productions, including The Hangover, Marley and Me, Game of Thrones, and Pirates of the Caribbean. An eyewitness who worked at BAU documented chronic neglect, including sick and injured animals who went without adequate veterinary care, filthy enclosures, and animals who were denied food so that they would be hungry when being trained to do tricks.      BAU has a training facility near Acton, California, and its “retirement” facility is in Lake Wales, Florida.  Dogs, including one who BAU staff said was used in the movie Hotel for Dogs, were kept outside and denied bedding, even when temperatures dropped into the low 40s. Those who staff claimed were used in The Solutrean and CBS’ Zoo were housed alone in kennels on hard concrete floors.     Snoop, a geriatric, ailing dog believed to have been used in the film Marmaduke, was frequently left outside overnight in temperatures below 50 degrees. After testing positive for heartworm and months of refusing to eat, vomiting, losing weight, and bleeding from his paws (apparently from his nails), he lost control of his bowel movements and was finally euthanized.     An owl named Crash, who BAU staff claimed was used in the Harry Potter movies, was kept in a feces-strewn enclosure that went uncleaned for at least six weeks. He and other birds of prey lived in inadequate, small enclosures and were deprived of both sensory stimulation and socialization.     Penguins who BAU employees said were used in Batman Returns were denied fresh drinking water. Their only source of water was a chlorinated pool.     Animals were sometimes denied food during training. Gus and Nibbs, two cats who BAU staff said were being used in the upcoming film Benji, were virtually starved for several days because a trainer said they were “fat,” and they lost 5 percent of their body weight in five days.  A 12-year-old pig named Miss Piggy, who BAU employees said was used as a piglet in the movie College Road Trip, frequently suffered from bloody sores all over her sides. The ranch manager told the eyewitness that she was suffering from melanoma. To the eyewitness’ knowledge, no veterinarian was called in to treat her.     Punky, a pig with severely overgrown hooves, went nearly two weeks without corrective trimming after the eyewitness pointed out her condition. The trimmer—a layperson, not a veterinarian—told the ranch manager that Punky had arthritis, but the pig received no pain relief or medication for the condition and, to the eyewitness’ knowledge, was not seen by a veterinarian.     A pig named Lewis had a severe limp for over a week before a veterinarian was called, and it was several weeks before he finally received effective treatment.     A young dove who was unable to walk was denied licensed veterinary care and was found dead nine days after the condition was reported to a manager.     An employee told the eyewitness that fully conscious pigeons’ heads were pulled off as a method of killing them. The employee explained that the heads don’t always come off on the first attempt. One pigeon was found infested with mites, slumped over, and barely moving. A manager said that she would “pull” the pigeon but two hours later had failed to do so, and the pigeon died.  Secrecy about training techniques appeared to be a priority: Most sessions took place in a building restricted only to trainers.  The living conditions documented at BAU are the industry norm for animals used in entertainment.  Please, avoid contributing to this cruel practice by refraining from buying tickets to movies that use live animals.",0,0,InfusedSediment,coOKvrsmQiI,-0.07494331065759638,2018-04-14 01:08:44,False,True
