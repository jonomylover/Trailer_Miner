2018-06-20T23:02:26,"A movie like this is essentially fantastic. I believe in everything Nazis were against. People of color DO make america a more culturally rich and special place and are just as good as white people. I love strong women too. And hurting others because they’re odd...who can deny thats awful? But heres the thing. On paper this movie is untouchable. Agree w all of it. I should be praising this movie as being extremely important and inspiring. But in real life many of these awful things..racism, bigotry, homophobia. They’re completely real and terrible. But there is a side of the political lane...a certain KIND of mindset...that is SO empathetic...so eager to right these wrongs...that they begin attributing every problem to them. And find them in everyone they dislike. The real life definition of racist, nazi, woman hater etc lose all power because everyone from your slightly un-pc uncle at a bbq to the latest pepsi ad is on trial and accused of being equal to the organized mass slaughter of an entire race. So...the real life political parallel then becomes clear in the film. And while all true and good hearted, the sane among us see it as the forced, blatant propaganda it is. Theyre using actual bad things as a tool to redefine whats bad about what they dont like...just like the nazis did. But the final nail in sanitys and reasons coffin is this....remember how on paper, separated from real life current day stuff, the movies absolutely right in its messages, forced or not? Well thats their teflon. If you criticize this film for being not subtle, saccharine, shmaltzy and condescending, or even just “meh” you are essentially saying a movie where different ppl are good n nazis are bad should not exist. Theyve got u. Ur a nazi. Ur a anti feminist. Ur alt right. I mean WHO ELSE but a straight up real deal racist would balk at a film like this? So we never win.....because its not about the content not being true. Its about the method of delivery, the real life political intent behind it, and the smug holier than thou spoonfed propaganda nature of it making what could have been a story of deep truth with an anti-hate crime stance we can all get behind, into the next last jedi-style debate where those who dont like it are toxic men and those who do are soy sipping trannies.

It's part of the real story. The writer doesn't even need to invent it - and they go ahead and LITERALIZE it.  Also;  >All dese stronk womyn, because womyn are so nice to me  ...He had lots of sexy ladies in his dioramas because he was a pervert who fetishsized women's clothing.

2018-08-28T06:57:29,In a tribute to Nazi supremacy I would like to congratulate them on the biggest blunder they had under their noses. The Nazi's had hundreds of thousands of prisoners that could have used their super drug on to turn into zombies that could have carried disease across the world that wouldn't have been able to be stopped.   But in typical fashion the farsightedness of Hitler couldn't even see that he had all of the power to rule the world right there in his own prison camps. How stupid can the Nazi's actually be to have a super drug that could be used to march hundreds of thousands of diseased and starving prisoners into the allied lines. I mean it...was...right...there. Hitler could have created the worlds first ever real army of the undead....Guess he was too busy being brilliant in typical Nazi style.,0,0,Dryson Bennington,W6dy7xQ8NeE,0.0971031746031746,2018-08-28 06:57:29,True,True

As he builds an astonishing art installation — a testament to the most powerful women he knows — through his fantasy world, he draws strength to triumph in the real one.

2018-10-26T07:49:11,"Hi everyone, I'm Mark Hogancamp's niece. I've read a lot of the comments here and I see that a lot of people are wondering why they are using Nazis in this movie. They are literally taking Mark's life and turning it into a movie. He was attacked at a bar after telling some guys that he liked to wear women's clothes. He then used the dolls as therapy to help him recover from the trauma of the attack. He built a small town, which he called Marwencol, in his backyard and began photographing the dolls within the town. He created a whole fictional world based on his life and a lot of people he knows. He's very into WWII, so he used Nazis to represent the men that beat him at the bar. In the story he created, he and the people of Marwencol try to stop and defeat the ""Nazi's."" This helped him unleash the anger he had built up towards the men who attacked him, and it also helped him to regain control of his hands. Mark was always a very talented and creative guy, but the attack left him with shaky hands, and he had a very hard time making art. Years of doing this has helped him immensely, and he has started drawing again. I have not seen this film yet, but this film comes from a documentary about Mark called Marwencol. The documentary explains everything, and even tells Mark's fictional story that he created.

This isn't some fairy tale people should be praising it is a horror story about how America's mental health care system is completely broken. This poor man had his memory beat out of him, was in a coma for 9 days, woke up thinking it was 1984 and was essentially told to kick rocks by whomever was in charge of treating him, he was left to stew in his own without any memory of who he once was and became so delusional he created an alternate world to cope with his trauma out of necessity.  honestly I'd recommend watching the documentary ""Marwencol"" first because this movie is DEFINITELY not the real story it's the typical glossed over feel good Hollywood nonsense and the message it sends is pretty bad considering it's PG-13: if life is too much disconnect from reality(as if we already don't have a problem with suicide); that is the polar opposite of what should be done when one is troubled and it creates an environment inside one's self ripe for the generation of anger and resentment which may eventually lead to violence or suicidal thoughts. If you've suffered trauma please, PLEASE seek treatment, do not create a world for yourself like this to hide in, it may be painful now, but you will be much better off in the long run.  edit: regardless of my opinion I do feel like Hogancamp will be thrilled to see his world literally come to life on the big screen.",3,0,Honk Honkler,W6dy7xQ8NeE,-0.008058608058608061,2018-12-20 18:04:55,False,True

They're literally being butt-hurt because a movie is trying to portray Nazis as bad.  1.) It's a movie and a lot of movies claim a creative license, so to speak, which allows them the ability and freedom to do things that aren't exactly close to the original storyline. That's fine. Plenty of historically inaccurate films are loved today. 2.) So when the film uses its creative license to blast Nazis, it's not trying to attack right-wingers, it's not trying to critique Trump, and it's not trying to be ""anti straight white male"". There is absolutely no correlation or reference to the Trump administration or to the stereotype that a lot of Republicans get for being ""sexist, racist, homophobic Nazis"". There is absolutely no evidence of that in the film or in its timing (don't you think they would've released that during Trump's inauguration time period rather than in the middle of his presidency to do that?) that it's trying to be ""anti-Trump"" or whatever shit you guys are coming up with. It's literally just trying to show that Nazis are bad people. And, in case you didn't know this before, they certainly are not good people. 3.) Why, in the loving hell, would you want to defend Nazis? Seriously. Logical, sensible conservatives would never in their right mind try to defend Nazis. The smart conservatives, not the alt-right shit trolls on Youtube, that I know of are well-spoken and give no reason for people to call them any stupid names or stereotypes, and this is coming from a left-leaning centrist. So why are the right-wingers and alt-right, the people who like to flaunt themselves as being more ""patriotic"" than the left, literally sympathizing with a manic, murderous group that was our enemy for a very, very, very long period of time? This seriously undermines all the sacrifices that many of our US Soldiers saw a century ago. If y'all be complaining about flag kneeling, then don't fucking try to back up Nazis.

2019-01-01T09:33:47,"Welcome to Marwen... The movie was just plain weird. Steve Carrell is great but the directing was garbage. There is a scene that really ticked me off. Mark is in court about to testify about the crimes that have been done to him. It had potential to be a heart wrenching, sad, and emotional scene. Instead, Marks doll character “Hogey” starts fighting nazis and Mark crawls on the ground avoiding the crossfire (bullets). The movie was more about Marks dolls then actually Mark. I feel like i saw more of “Hogey” then Mark himself. Not about overcoming his fears. The movie felt boring, i had no care on what the Marwen characters had to say because THEY ARE NOT REAL. They said based on a true story, they forgot to tell me 2/3’s of the movie is dolls fighting.  The movie also left plenty of questions unanswered. When Mark is in Wendy’s house, he notices a photo of a young child. It says something like “We miss you” or “You will forever be in our hearts”. But We never know what happend to the child and why it is included in the movie. The movie also didn’t tell us more about the side characters. The women of Marwen are Marks friends. But we never really go deep into who the characters actually are. Next, The movie ends with Mark and his good friend (Roberta) going out to eat some sushi, thats it. Nothing else, do they continue dating, do they end up marrying at one point? Lastly, this is my biggest frustration: In the end of the movie the film does not tell you what happens to the thugs that beat Mark up. Do they get a long sentencing? Do they get life in prison??? You wont know because they wont tell you. This movie is very confusing, making you wonder if it is Marks fantasy or real life. There was no music that moved you, no emotional scenes.

They are literally taking Mark's life and turning it into a kino. He was attacked at a bar after telling some guys that he liked to wear women's clothes. He then used the dolls as therapy to help him recover from the trauma of the attack. He built a small town, which he called Marwencol, in his backyard and began photographing the dolls within the town. He created a whole fictional world based on his life and a lot of people he knows. He's very into WWII, so he used Nazis to represent the men that beat him at the bar. In the story he created, he and the people of Marwencol try to stop and defeat the ""Nazi's."" This helped him unleash the anger he had built up towards the men who attacked him, and it also helped him to regain control of his hands. Mark was always a very talented and creative guy, but the attack left him with shaky hands, and he had a very hard time making art. Years of doing this has helped him immensely, and he has started drawing again. I have not seen this film yet, but this film comes from a documentary about Mark called Marwencol. The documentary explains everything, and even tells Mark's fictional story that he created.
