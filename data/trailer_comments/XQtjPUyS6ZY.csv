I like the idea, but it's basically just like every ""coming of age in school"" movie I've seen, like that stupid Diary of a Wimpy Kid. Maybe it will be better than I think, but I also think it will be way too ""forced,"" if you're catching my drift. It seems like the jokes will be sitcom-esque and generally sigh-inducing as if to imply a laugh track behind it. I wouldn't be surprised if there was one. I hope the acting is better than the usual kid acting, too. Just in general, there are a lot of risks when I think about seeing this movie, so I'll just wait until it comes out on Netflix, I can wait.",0,0,Beemer,XQtjPUyS6ZY,-0.010714285714285702,2016-06-24 06:54:03,True,True

The book, in my eyes, is a study of depression and loneliness, while also appealing to middle school kids by presenting realistic, likable three-dimensional characters. Instead, this movie is aiming to be like a mix of Diary of A Wimpy Kid, Kirby Buckets and Max Keeble's Big Move. It seems pandering by presenting the principal as a ""villain"" who hates creativity for seemingly no reason, while in the book he simply is someone who believes in a society with organized rules and regulations, and having everyone in the school band together to ""fight the powers that be"", trying to appeal to millennials.

2016-08-13T13:22:13,"EAPP11_REV2016.  This film is based on the book with similar name. It is a comedy movie that depicts a kind of a child entering in the middle school. He is very imaginative. He describes his life as a crazy world. Then, his high school life begins. At first, he thinks it is the best year ever but after day and weeks the story becomes different. He is like in the prison. There are so many rules that need to be obeyed. But when his game flinches to draw alongside with him, he'll have to choose if winning is matters most, or he's lastly prepared to surpass the rulebooks, tyrants, and reality he’s always escaping the director of this to be s  The director of this film that is nearly to be released, strictly follow the story line of the book written by James Patterson. The good thing about this movie is that it makes the words written in the book into reality. Because it is based on the book, the plot line is already predicted but then again, on the trailer I felt I just freshly knew the story.  The cinematography shown on the trailer is very impressive.  The angles of the camera are very appropriate to the scene and mood that needs to be depicted. The lighting, the costume, and the whole production are absolutely near to perfect. The choice of music portrays the emotions of every character in the film. Overall, I will give it a double  thumbs up.  The content of this trailer catches the heart of every teenager who experience difficulty during their high school or middle school years. It makes me realize if I’m also in that situation, I will do that. Definitely do that.  This film allows teenagers and also parents to see deeper the reality of everyday lives of middle school children in home and especially in school. It helps us to deeper understand the coping mechanisms do by the middle school children in order for them to survive that worst years of their lives.  I will recommend this film to my friends in order for them to understand what they also experienced.",1,1,jl a,XQtjPUyS6ZY,0.21515151515151515,2016-08-13 13:22:13,True,True

How about we make a movie adaptation of the book that completly butchers the original source material and transform a surprisingly mature story for young people into a generic and boring ""SKOOL SUCKS, LETS BE REBELZ AND STUFF"" story, killing every inch of nuance that the original plot had? No? Too bad, corporate Hollywood can't take risks, they gotta reach for the lowest common denominator, because although original ideas and concepts ARE SCARY!  Seriously, the original Rafael wasn't handsome or charismatic, he didn't lead rebellions, his stepfather was abusive, not cartoonishly ""mean"", the adults were often portrayed as horrible monsters, but you could see that it was because of Rafe's wild imagination, because Rafael is CREATIVE, he is an ARTIST. he is DIFFERENT. He was a loner and a bit socially awkward, he didn't have any friends, in fact, I think the whole reason why he decided to break every rule on the school was because he wanted people to acknowledge his existance, not because his school was a prison, his school was very normal. Sucky, perhaps, but normal. The book dealt with themes such as loneliness, bullying, consequences for one's actions, depression, family, being different and trying to fit in and more. And maybe i'm wrong, maybe the trailer is very misleading, but i highly doubt it.
