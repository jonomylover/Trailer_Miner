2017-10-06T02:33:17,"Maybe it's just me but maybe some people don't find it as appealing (as I do, along with many others) because they aren't in that period of their lives. I watched this film in Toronto and it really – to say the least – transcended to me. Hollywood has mass produced coming-of-age films and now ART coming-of-age films because they're on the rise. Though, it always either took place in the middle of high school or in the middle of college. Not in that awkward transition between both. I guess I liked it, and it hit me, because I'm a part of that demographic. Though honestly? You don't have to be a fresh-out-of-high-school teenage girl in order to like this film. I'm sure most of you have experienced preparing for college yourself. Sometimes what you expect to happen is not what you expected there. That's what this movie is about. It's okay to dislike a film but I think it's rather pretentious when you judge it by what you see on the surface.

2017-11-30T23:40:41,"Over Thanksgiving break, I sat down in a local movie theatre, unprepared of an experience.  It is few and far between that I watch my own problems unfold on the screen.  I watched something I could actually relate to.   I watched Lady Bird. It is often taxing to sift through film history and find movies that really understand the daunting existence of a teen/twenty-year-old on the verge of life.  This movie really hit the nail with the hammer.  The reason I really enjoyed this film was because I think it unapologetically deals with the issues of a teenager that many people find too 'small' 'unimportant' or 'naive' to cope with on screen.  While Lady Bird is not a film that holds the force that perhaps Hotel Rwanda does, it does hold a niche in a type of movie that has never been done before. (Or at least not that I've seen.)  There have obviously been films made about teenagers.  However, when I watch High School Musical or Clueless, the lives of those 'perfect' teens are often out of reach, flawless, or absolutely un relatable to the average viewer.  While Lady Bird does have two love interests they are not the leading story line in her existence, rather they serve as underwhelming distractions to her real issues.  One such issue being coping with her fragile mother-daughter relationship.  This brittle relationship is one I can often understand; it was able to hold a silent background theme throughout the whole film.  Instead the trials and tribulations of lady bird's day to day life took our minds away from this, but it was always there sitting quietly until the final moments of the movie.  As a twenty-one-year-old girl, I was gasping at Greta Gerwig's ability to really comprehend the complexities of a life challenged by the unchallenged. My relationship with my mom is not to the extreme of the film, however we do argue a lot about house hold economics and futuristic issues similar to that of Christine and Marion.  This film was a sort of love letter to mothers everywhere as they struggle to say good bye and daughters who want to let go.  There is so much love between the two, but it is difficult for the two to express it at times.   Another aspect of this film I related to was the sense of middle class 'making it'.  Often times, money is tight in a lot of family's homes across the nation but it is difficult to find this economic class portrayed on television or the big screen.  It is either dirt poor or extremely well off.  Two shows that display this are that of Shameless versus that of House of Cards.  If a movie or show depicts a middle class family, it is often in a perfectly well off manner; think that of Modern Family.  These middle class families are typically really happy and seem to get by just find enjoying vacations or monumental events like getting one's first car.  Something about these 'middle' American family's often depicts them as insanely engaged in their child's life.  We see this in Father of the Bride, or even the unspoiled middle class family in Home Alone.  What Lady Bird did was revolutionary in showing the struggles to just keep up the financial side of being middle class.  While Christine's mother is present in a lot of the movie, she is absent for some of the key moments in Lady Bird's life.  While Lady Bird goes off to prom, her mom is working a double shift enable to keep the family a float.  Several key moments in the movie high light this fight well:  1) The scene in which Lady Bird and her mother find comfort in attending house showings they will never be able to afford…  2) Lady Bird's desperate pull back from her mother to attend an 'out of state-out of pocket' school… 3)  Lady Bird's comment on her house being on the wrong side of the tracks.  This remark brings great discomfort to her mother as her family is just barely making it (with her father being unemployed).       Finally, the last aspect of the film that I fell in love with was Lady Bird's not so leading men.  Most teen movies are that of a love story that in some way changes the main characters, and concludes with the two falling in harmonious love.  Lady Bird painted a picture of the men in my life today.  For the better or worse, I enjoyed a film that showed a lot of the true colors of relationships today: flaky and obscure (the men not quite fitting the perfect bachelor title).  Spoiler alert: (even though most of this post is a spoiler) one of Christine's love interests turned out to be gay.  I thought that the story line for this was really well written, it showed the way in which one's coming out effects past partners.  A story line often ignored in media (seen as well in Hannah and Elijah's Girl's relationship).  The second man was a classic uncaring douche that many people have likely come in contact with.  This antagonist had such a built up story line but ultimately (and realistically) failed and disappointed our main character in an anticlimactic manner.  The scene in which the two broke things off was very tangible.  After imaging and creating an idea of the loss of her virginity, Lady Bird decides to give it away to Kyle, she is in turn let down immediate after.  Kyle was in turn dishonest about his virginity, going on to reassure lady Bird by telling her she will have loads of not so perfect sex in her life. When I think of films showing teen sex, it is often done in an exciting and giggly manner, with the main characters often attached to each other forever and ever and ever blah blah blah. (The Fault in Our Stars anyone?)  While Kyle was the most aggravating character in the movie, he was someone who I could clearly point out in my own life. Movies typically do not show sexual moments as being dull or disappointing, but I think the reality of it is they too often are.  Society needs films that will show the lack of impact or gravity of those situations.     So if you've garnered anything from my post, go watch Lady Bird immediately.
