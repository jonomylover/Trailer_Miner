2017-07-27T17:50:05,"Typical Hollywood over-worked ""reboot/remake"" (call ""IT"" whatever (excuse the pun)). Nice camera work, good looking cast and a shiny trailer to sell the product as usual. After all is said and done, as with all horror remakes, its just another Hollywood cash-in project just like all the rest. Theres no originality. Long gone are the 60s, 70s and 80s where horror had its best times and Hollywood steered clear of fucking everything up.   Personally, ALL films made should have Copyright clauses stating no film can be remade within 50 years of the originals release date. That'd force screenwriters to actually invent new, fresh and plausible ideas. Or at least come up with something that isnt a reboot etc. Its films like this that are creating a stale environment for everyone, and everyone is stupid enough to fall for it. If we all steered clear of theatrical releases of reboots and boycotted their attempts at remakes, box office figures would be down, that would make Hollywood reassess what they are actually doing but people are to thick to think outside the box and you still throw money into the big wigs pockets. As good as people assume reboots may be, remember, for every reboot made, there are struggling filmmakers trying hard as hell to create a film on a minimal budget. This is a BAD thing for the film business. Hollywood have screwed up pretty much every horror remake. There are a few exceptions which mainly came out in the 80s, and a few in the 90s. Dont fall for this hype. As much as i love horror (been obsessed with it for over 30 yrs now) i have to steer clear of this film purely out of principal and also for the fact its hurting Indy film production because everyone expects big motion pictures where millions has been thrown at it. Give me cult 80s slasher films, giallo, underground horror, jap splatter, hammer horror (first run of filmmaking), Amicus productions and Indy work anyday. Thats whats important for the horror community. Thats where true horror lies with true passionate filmmakers who make films for the true horror fan, not the brainwashed general cinema goer who part with their hard-earned cash to fund future remakes.  If youre still not sold as to why remakes hurt the filmmaking business, take a look at what Hollywood did to the Original Blair Witch Project. No, im not on about the recent reboot (which also sucked balls), but im on about how quick Hollywood saw a money making opportunity and made Book of Shadows (Blair Witch 2). Within one year Hollywood threw a script together, filmed and released it. What. A. Joke! Just for the money. Blair 2 was utter garbage and failed miserably. No thought went  into it what so ever!Regardless whether you like or dislike the original Blair With Project, the fact remains that the internet was in its infancy back in '99. The whole marketing ploy behind TBWP was pure genious. This ploy can no longer be done but thanks to their clever marketing and website and Indy footage, The Blair Witch Project has gone on to be one of the higgest grossing films ever made when compared to the initial outlay costs.  Now, how many other cult classics have been screwed up by Hollywood? Well, the list is endless but you all bought in to it. Heres a few that sprung to mind:  Texas chainsaw massacre Psycho The ring Day of the dead Dawn of the dead Hills have eyes The crazies Evil dead Nightmare on elm street Prom night House of wax Carrie Black christmas The hitcher Friday 13th The fog Dark water The wicker man The Omen Children of the corn The eye House on haunted hill  And so on....  Did you buy in to any of those? Some of you did. Why? Stop buying in to it. Support the originals, support Indy filmmakers and lets show Hollywood they cant do this crap anymore.  I love the original IT. The only time im going to see this is when it drops on Sky Movies or if i see it in a bargain bin for less than 3 quid.",0,1,ToxSic PunK,xKJmEC5ieOk,0.021983283671595348,2017-07-27 17:50:05,True,True

I mean, I think on the Books (And specially on the Curry Miniseries) Pennywhise had one Clown Form that was friendly, kinda like ""Ronald McDonalds"" vibe. In the Miniseries itself was retarded to see Georgie trying to grab the paper boat from Pennywhise (A Clown that suddenly shown down there, but a Happy and ""Friendly"" Clown).  Now Pennywhise it's full on ""Scary Mode"". If I was that kid and saw THIS Pennywhise, I will run the fuck out and escape the country if needed. Georgie can't be THAT Stupid to TRUST on THIS Pennywhise, who's a ""guy"" with a Creepy AF Smile and Eyes and shit.  It kinda ruins the whole point of the scene and makes Georgie the King of The Retards. I can see HISHE playing with this scene if they do the ""How ""IT"" Should have ended"".   I mean, Pennywhise has this ""Scary Mode"" version too...and the ""Friendly Version"" one too. Make him Full Scary makes him predictable, sorta.

The kids are dead on with their characters,Eddie as a hypochondriac and Richie as ""The man of 1000 voices"". The balloons look fake and super symmetrical because they're SUPPOSED TO. THEY'RE PART OF PENNYWISE'S ILLUSIONS. He isn't supposed to be friendly and inviting. He only appeared that way to one person: Georgie.

Years later I read the book and while I still like the original adaptation, there's no doubt that they didn't do the story justice. There's so many great moments in the book that were left out or not explored. This looks like a more faithful adaptation and includes moments from the novel that fans will love to see on the screen. Plus I like that the film is split into two parts. The ""Kids Story"" and ""Adults Story"" are both super important but it's extremely difficult to include both in one film with losing a huge chunk of what makes IT great.",1,0,Eleanora,xKJmEC5ieOk,0.35055555555555556,2017-07-27 21:55:41,True,True

Pennywise looks great and the kid actors chosen look like they can carry a film. The aspect of the adults acting mysterious and pretending like there is no demon clown is a neat premise. My biggest concerns come down to writing and jumpscares. The story is simple but can be amazing if written well but again horror films have trouble with that. Then there's jumpscares, I hate this the most. Not because they scare me but because it is a cheap scare and when given to the wrong writers will bring about the fake-out jumpscare which is worse. A couple sprinkled in will be fine but if every encounter with Pennywise is a damn jumpscare then I'm out. The best horror moments come from atmosphere, setting, lighting, the presence of the threat, errie ambient noises, and just the sound design in general. Let Pennywise be creepy, threatening, and terrifying without resorting to cheap flashes and loud bangs.",0,0,Mason Fuller,xKJmEC5ieOk,0.09777777777777777,2017-07-27 22:33:53,True,True

2017-07-28T00:53:55,"God loved each of us so much that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to bear our sin and die in our place. ‚ÄúGod demonstrates His love toward us, in that, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us‚Äù (Romans 5:8). Although we cannot understand how, God said our sins were laid upon Jesus and He died in our place. Jesus became our substitute.  In the Bible, a jailer asked his prisoners, Paul and Silas: ‚Äú‚ÄôSirs, what must I do to be saved?‚Äô So they said, ‚ÄòBelieve on the Lor...d Jesus Christ, and you will be saved.‚Äô‚Äù (Acts 16:30-31).  It‚Äôs very clear in the Bible, believe in Jesus as the one who bore your sins, died in your place, was buried, and whom God resurrected. It‚Äôs Christ‚Äôs blood and resurrection that assures us of everlasting life when we call on Him as our Lord and Savior. ""For whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved."" (Romans 10:13). ‚ÄúWhosoever‚Äù includes each and every one of us. but theres a eternal conmdenatin call hell, and separation from God. Therefore, if you understand that you are a sinner, and you believe that Jesus Christ came as the one and only Redeemer of sin, then you understand the plan of salvation. The question is ‚Äì are you ready to implement the plan, by receiving God‚Äôs gift of His Son, Jesus Christ? If so, believe in Christ, repent of your sins, and commit the rest of your life to Him as Lord:‚ÄúFather, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer.

Finn Wolfhard was cast in the movie before Stranger Things wen Cary Fukanaga was attached to the movie.  He left the project and production was on hold again for rewrites.

I like the 90s miniseries but I'd like to see how this one would work as well.  It looks like Pennywise is gonna be a lot less chatty but hopefully not It's primary form, and I'm also hoping for more build up scares, and more story line. Don't misunderstand me, I like the miniseries, and will attempt to avoid comparisons...but on home media  probably for me.   Splitting it up like Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit may work, but not a whole years waiting time, just an idea.

He has entertaining enough stuff, but let's face it: h e is virtually always churning out derivatives off of other people's earlier works.  I'd not be surprised to see his studio fill of writers laboring under his ""tutelage"", like so many Thomas Kinkade-esque studios invariably degenerate into.   Yes, simply rehash old themes, it's marketed as ""New and Original out of NYC of Hollyweird"", but really, it's all about as original as this latest reboot.   Remember back when it was: Ohhh, it's set in Maine! What an original twist!, How unique! How creepy! Not so ,much. See: Dark Shadows, (1966) Whispering Gables (1968): Hunter's Hill (1973) The Glory Hand (1983)  ""IT"" (written:1986)  derives from the likes of:  Carnival of Souls (1962) The Clown Murders (1976) Poltergeist (1982). I'm astonished that he's not been sued for copyright infringement.   Oh wait, he's being sued right now for Plagiarism for a character in ""Dork Tower"". I'd bet TWO things about King; he settles out of court and never had to sue someone else for plagiarizing his plagiarisms, lolz..   ""Apparently about 60+ things from Duma Key would look like Ron Marquardt's""Keller's Den"" book, published in 2002."" (coutrhousenews,com)  Go compare: The Running Man to The Prize of Peril (1958).

I'm not sure they'll include this as graphically in the film, but, a novel as sinister and dark as this one deserves adult treatment. What's worrying is that many here still believe it's a remake, rather than a fresh adaptation - because they forget that books exist. Also, it's not just ""another horror film"" to be placed beside generic box office hits; it's an imagining of one of the scariest stories ever written. Definitely not ""a creepy clown flick"".

The other one is in the basement, first we see the excellent performance by Georgie's actor. You'll float too never has sounded more epically scary. And then Pennywise rises from the waters. I jumped in my chair and still do when watching this. I can tell I will be on the edge of my seat in theatres this september.  The movie itself seems to capture that 80s feeling we've seen in Stranger Things and other important work. Do your part and see it in theaters.

2017-09-08T13:03:12,"I thought the movie was good. It was much scarier than a lot of recent horror movies/ tv shows that try to replace horror with gore etc. Pennywise was definitely very well acted and the scenarios portrayed exactly the kind of separation and oppression a demon does to it's victims to gain trust and feed on their fear before taking the person over... or in this case to eat for movie purposes. I think if this movie was the first version of it created with then no one would say a word otherwise. The original movie, lacked the technology that gave more abilities to this movie which gave it more to the actors to show and relate to to feel the fear as they did. While we get th at as well with a great cast, we also had more visually to aid in that as well..  Most scariest .movie ever? No.  Acting scale 1-10 ? I give it a 9 Scare factor 1-10? Solid 8. I agree it could have been a little more frightening .   Overall I give it a 9 out of ten. Really played to each fear well and better storytelling as well as better true horror appeal than recent movies.",8,1,Greg Pollitt,xKJmEC5ieOk,0.25913461538461535,2017-09-08 13:03:12,False,True

By far one of the best Stephen's King adaptations.

2017-09-09T01:26:29,"Just watched IT and I gotta say to anyone who thinks it'll suck it won't! I promise! The movie was really well made and does the novel justice. The humor in this movie was also what was great about it! You'd think it'd be just a bunch of kids doing lame shit, but I assure you! IT's totally not! Just the first 10 mins of the movie got me really messed up lol. There were even some scenes that were really terrifying. While watching this, just another heads up, try to pay attention to the subtle details in the movie, cause if you've read the novel by Stephen King, then just wait and see, cause Chapter 2 will be on a whole nava level, lol. I can totally say it was well made to the point you aren't feeling bored, its very entertaining and another thing the music in the movie was really good too! So as a person who loves the horror genre and know this, in the last few years with a shitty bunch of horror movies out, this isn't one of those. Also, best part! No shitty jump scares!

2017-09-09T12:34:01,"This was the greatest movie I have ever seen! I went with my mom last night, who is a huge Steven King fan. I haven't read a Steven King book yet, and my mom read IT when she was about 12, my age. We went to see the Dark Tower about a month or two ago, and while we were driving back from the theatre, she was telling me about all the left out things and missed opportunities. But, on the drive back from the theatre after IT, she told me about how much it followed the book, and while watching the movie she was reminded of things in the book. And I, someone who hasn't read the book, was able to follow the movie and enjoy  IT. To be completely honest, this is probably not the scariest movie ever. I was able to get to sleep last night just fine. IT uses lots of jump scares, but not cheap ones that lose their scariness after two times. They still surprise you, and the jump scares used creepy imagery. And it's not just Pennywise jump scares, there are other creatures too. You should also know that there is plenty of blood in the movie, and not so much guts and gore. The closest there is to gore is in the beginning where (spoiler alert) Pennywise bites off Georgie's arm, and Georgie tries to crawl away using his bitten-off arm and his unhurt arm. But that's about it. This movie is more of a physiological horror than a torture movie. So, if you're into that, whether your a Steven King fan or not, or have read the book or not, go watch IT.",0,0,Livy,xKJmEC5ieOk,0.18208333333333332,2017-09-09 12:34:01,False,True

2017-09-11T04:59:24,"Genocide  of 500000 ethnic Ukrainians who were citizens of  the Second Polish Republic and they  were expelled from their homeland in the Poland People‚Äôs Republic  to Soviet Ukraine in 1945-1951. According to the agreement between the Government of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and Polish Committee of National Liberation evacuation of Ukrainian population from the territory Poland and Polish citizens from the territory of the USSR signed September 9, 1944 which was  forcibly deportation Ukrainian population who were citizens of  the Second Polish Republic. Yalta (Crimea) Conference of the Allied Powers (4 -11 February 1945) ‚Äì the meeting of leaders of the anti-Hitler coalition - the USSR, the US and the UK - during the Second World War, dedicated to the establishment of the post-war world order. It was necessary to install unofficial but generally accepted by all parties to the line between the spheres of influence of the Allies - the work which was begun at the Tehran Conference in 1943. The redistribution of boundaries Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin, having gone on mutual concessions, agreed on almost all counts. As a result, the land where  ethnic Ukrainians lived for centuries  were given to Poland. In another agreement  was signed during the conference, which was very important for the Soviet side, namely an agreement on the repatriation of military and civilian, that is displaced - persons released (captured) in the territories captured by the Allies. In  the result of this agreement people were transferred to the Soviet side not only  Soviet citizens and the Ukrainian population lives in  centuries, never had Soviet citizenship. Stalin tried to create not just political borders but also to reinforce their ethnic boundaries, engaging in resettlement, eviction, as well as religious, liquidated the Greek-Catholic Church and transferring its faithful to Orthodoxy. part of the section according to the Molotov - Ribbentrop Pact. Stalin received the international legitimacy of the Western Allies in Yalta on those areas that were actually captured in 1939. Before World War II, a number of large population movements were the result of bilateral agreements and has received the support of international organizations such as the League of Nations. But changes began when the Charter of the Nuremberg Trials of German Nazi leaders accused of forced deportation of civilians during the Second World War as a war crime and a crime against humanity. At the heart of change has been a tendency to take into account human rights, thereby limiting the rights of nation states impose decrees that affect them.""Where is the movement of the population used as a means of resolving the ethnic conflict, today, forced displacement of the population considered to be a violation of international law."" (Denver Journal of International Law and Policy, in spring 2001, P116).Thus, although the signatories of the agreements of the Yalta and Potsdam conferences on the eviction of civilians is lawful in accordance with international law of the time, the present historians and scholars in the field of international law and human rights, have revised their evaluation of events and claim that the transfer of population Poles and Ukrainians in Eastern Europe should be regarded as episodes of ethnic cleansing, and thus a violation of human rights. In USSR  was the totalitarian  communist regime which created  the great  famine within the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic is called Holodomor or ""hungry mass-death"" in 1933 and 6 million ukrainian farmers dyed form starving and who survived were sent to Gulag, Siberia. Most of them are dead by now. Their real estates, land and other properties, most farms equipments and furniture was given to Poland. Now days they had not received any compensation neither for properties left in Poland or their human rights had been taken  away from them as a human and ukrainian nation. No one wants help them to get their human rights back. Ethnic ukrainian people has no human rights in their life only left for them to die and disappear from this earth.   My mother‚Äôs parents were among of them as well as my mother, who died in May 2013 could not wait any more for justice. One more victim of this crime disappear so as many of them.   No one compensated my family for this act. Polish Government keeps ignoring their human rights because they are Ukrainian nationality not polish. Only polish nationality can be repatriated back to Poland according to polish law up to now.   The status of most of the deportees belonged to a special category of immigrants. Luck of housing, basic necessities, medicines and food is particularly acute affected the first batch of deportees. On arrival people were placed homes of local residents ""by condensed them"".

According to the Soviet government documents, these people were ""exceptional economic value"" - as free labor - the needs of socialist totalitarian system, just as workers have used forced labor in Germany for the purposes of National Socialist mechanism. People previously the owners became slaves had to work from dawn to dusk in the Soviet state on the boundless collective farms,  being paid ‚Äústicks workdays‚Äù  instead of money, and could not moved anywhere without documents, so they could not live the village.

2017-09-18T08:37:00,"I was really disappointed with this movie. To me the original was far better, maybe because it had less special affects in it, and gave more of the story line. For instance, in the original IT movie, the scene where it shows the boys riding, fast to get away from something so scary, you can't see it, but in your mind you built up this image of something so horrifying, that it leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat! Tim Curry did a superb job as Pennywise the clown, of course he was a more experienced actor, and not to put down the new guy, just I don't think anyone can take the place of Tim Curry's performance of being Pennywise.  It's like they over tried to make it scary, and just like so many horror movies these days, it sucked, because they forget sometimes too much special affects in my opinion can ruin a movie, because it leaves nothing left to the imagination, where you build up something far more sinister in your mind, and scares the hell out of you! Actually one of the most scariest parts of the original IT was when Pennywise disguised himself as a gas station attendant, because they make the scene at first seem so innocent, like just a normal thing, you have to stop to get gas, but then when he gives the woman directions, and his voice changes and mixes with that of Pennywise, and what made it so scary just by something so simple, by just changing the guys voice. To me sometimes simple things like this, are far more frightening, and makes me a bit apprehensive about stopping for gas at some small country gas station, where you have one attendant working.

Sure kids are kids and they don't always talk decent at times, because they are kids, and kids want to rebel a bit from what is supposed to be proper and what is not, however the vulgarity they used when they would talk in certain conversations and their sarcasm with each other in this film, reminded me of the way the disrespectful youths you hear talk of today, so it took away from the innocence of the kids in this film that they made for the new IT movie. When you compare to the original IT movie, where they had the kids growing up, I think took place around the 50'r or early 60's, where the kids were like typical children of that time period. A more innocent time period of children in those days. In the original film I believe it was far more accurate.

2017-09-27T17:19:51,Skardsgard wishes he could be Pennywise as much as this movie wishes it could be IT. We don't become enamored with the kids individually like we did in the original. If not for having watched the original I would not have known which kid was which even halfway through the film. None seemed very special to me and they tried to make us like them by having them curse and make sexual mother jokes way too often. I also didn't appreciate how they diminished Mike Hanlon's role in this one and giving what made his character so special over to Ben Hanscom. I wonder what that's about. I mean Ben has issues that define his character already. Skarsgard blatantly tries to make his voice sound like something scary but fails miserably. This Bill can't hold a candle to Johnathan Brandis. I couldn't care less if he died or about how he felt about Georgie's death which he didn't seem to mourn over about much as in the original. The film isn't scary at all and relies more on jump scares than actual horror. Huge fail of a remake and doesn't capture my heart and imagination like the original. Ruins one of my favorite films of all time and makes me wonder how it and its characters have gotten such undeserved praise.,0,0,iLLWiLL,xKJmEC5ieOk,0.038163919413919396,2017-09-27 17:19:51,False,True

If they used a fully costume bill with more gore effects rather than using this  it would be a great movie.

The kids, the bullies the adults and Skarsgard's acting is on point and the filmmaking from Andy Muschietti and her sister is amazing. So proud to be an argentinian. Don't even get me started on the Soundtrack. From the first song that Bill's Mother is playing on the piano to the emotional Blood Oath song the music was perfect. I can't stress enough how the Blood Oath scene was the best!! The song on that scene, the growth from the kids and the feel that they are never going to be reunited that way again adds an emotional weight to that scene that no other movie could ever achieve. Makes me tear up every time I hear that song and remember about that moment! This isn't just a simple scary film, it's a coming of age story with a deep meaning: fear holds you back. You have to dare and live every day at it's fullest and don't be afraid. Thank you Muschiettis and the crew. You've created a masterpiece.

2017-10-12T10:22:34,"*No Spoilers* Derry, ME, October 1988 - Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher) helps his little brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) make a paper sailboat, calling it the S.S. Georgie. Georgie wants to go outside to sail it in the pouring rain, but Bill is too sick to join him. The brothers hug before Georgie runs out to play.  Georgie sails his boat down the street. He chases after it and accidentally runs into a roadblock. The boat sails to the end of the street until it falls into the sewer. Georgie runs to try and get it, worried that Bill will be mad. As he looks into the sewer, a pair of yellow eyes emerge. They belong to an entity calling itself Pennywise the dancing clown (Bill Skarsgard). Pennywise playfully speaks to Georgie before offering him his boat back. Georgie reaches for it, only for Pennywise to grab his arm and sink his massive teeth into it. The creature rips off Georgie's arm and leaves him crying for Bill before dragging him down into the sewers.  June 1989 - We meet Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) as his grandfather Leroy (Steven Williams) is making him kill a sheep with a nail gun. Leroy lectures the boy before doing the deed himself.  It's the last day of school. Bill and his friend Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), and Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff), who all form The Losers Club, are heading out to start their summer. Unfortunately, they run into the school's psychopathic bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) and his goons Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague), Victor Criss (Logan Thompson), and Belch Huggins (Jake Sim). Bill tells Henry he sucks after the punk mocks his friends, and Henry approaches Bill threateningly until he sees his father, Officer Bowers (Stuart Hughes), standing behind Bill. He walks away, but not before licking his palm and smearing it on Bill's face.  A girl named Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis) is smoking in the bathroom. A group of mean girls led by Gretta (Megan Charpentier) taunt her and accuse Bev of being a slut. One girl fills a trash bag full of water and dumps it on Bev, but she covers her head with her book. On her way out of the building, Beverly meets the new kid, Ben Hascom (Jeremy Ray Taylor). He gets picked on for his weight and he doesn't have friends. Bev signs his yearbook, and Ben appears to develop a crush on her.  When Bill gets home, his father Zach (Geoffrey Pounsett) scolds him for creating a model with tubes of the sewer system in Derry since he still believes that Georgie is only missing. Zach tells him to accept that Georgie is dead.  Mike goes to the butcher shop to make a delivery. Behind the door around the alley, he hears what sounds like screaming and pounding. The door opens and several burnt hands start sticking out. Mike then sees Pennywise, but is nearly run over by the Bowers gang in a car. Mike flees.  Stan is at the synagogue studying for his bar mitzvah. There is a painting in the rabbi's office that creeps him out showing a woman with a distorted face. The painting falls, and when Stan picks it up, the woman is gone. He turns around and IT manifests as the woman with a fanged smile. Stan runs away.  Ben is at the library looking up Derry's history. From a series of articles, he learns that children in Derry have been disappearing under mysterious circumstances for centuries. The book contains a depiction of Pennywise and a missing boy's head in a tree. Ben is then lured into the basement where he sees the headless boy before getting chased out by Pennywise.  On his way home, Ben is attacked by the Bowers gang. Henry's goons hold him against the bridge railing. Patrick wants to burn Ben with a lighter and bug spray, but Henry plans to carve his name into Ben's stomach. An old couple drive by and see this but do nothing (it's implied that IT is there with the presence of a red balloon). Henry only cuts an H before Ben kicks him in the nuts and rolls over the bridge and into the woods. The punks chase after Ben. Meanwhile, the Losers are near the sewers as Bill has convinced his friends to help him find Georgie. Ben falls into the water near them, and the boys grab him and bring him to safety.  Patrick runs into the sewers to try and get Ben, splitting from his friends. He encounters demonic-looking children that make him run, but he comes across a dead end. A bunch of red balloons appear before him, and they all pop to reveal Pennywise, who promptly devours Patrick.  The boys go to the pharmacy to get cotton balls and bandages, but they are short on money. Beverly is there buying tampons when she runs into the boys. After hearing their problem, Bev pretends to flirt with the pharmacist, Mr. Keene (Joe Bostick), to distract him. He comes off as a creep to her, but she manages to distract him long enough for the boys to steal their supplies, and for her to sneak away some cigarettes. Bev goes outside and joins the boys when she sees the boys tending to Ben.  Beverly goes home to her father (Stephen Bogaert), who is an even bigger creep than Mr. Keene. He comes onto his daughter, causing her to run into the bathroom crying. She then proceeds to cut off her hair until it's at a shorter length.  The boys (now joined by Ben) are at the quarry ready to jump into the lake, but no one is eager to go first. Bev shows up and jumps first, leading the others to join. They have fun while swimming and hanging out. Later, Ben tells everyone what he read about in Derry's history.  Eddie is walking home when he passes the abandoned house on Neibolt Street. He is suddenly attacked by a leper (Javier Botet), causing Eddie to run through the house's yard. As he reaches the fence, he sees Pennywise trying to lure him toward him. Eddie runs under the fence and escapes.  Bev is in her room with a postcard with a poem written on it by a secret admirer. She thinks it's Bill but it was actually Ben that wrote it. From her bathroom, Bev hears the voices of children. She looks into the sink where the voices are, and clumps of hair start reaching out to grab her before a fountain of blood gushes all over the bathroom. Mr. Marsh comes in to see Bev horrified, but he cannot see the blood. He simply comments that her hair makes her look like a boy.  Bill is walking around the house when he sees what looks like Georgie running around. Shocked, he follows Georgie to the basement, which is flooding. Georgie steps out and invites Bill to join him, saying ""We all float down here. You'll float too."" He repeats ""You'll float too"" until he yells and decomposes. Pennywise then emerges from the water and tries to get Bill, but he runs out of the basement.  The next day, the kids are riding their bikes when they see Mike's bike and the Bowers gang's car. They go down by the creek to find the punks harassing Mike for being black. Bev throws a rock at Henry's head, which initiates a rock-throwing war between both groups. Mike runs over to the Losers side while Vic and Belch run away as Henry is knocked unconscious.  As the kids walk away with Mike, Bill mentions what he saw in his house. Eddie backs him up on having seen Pennywise. Mike mentions what he saw and talks about how his old house was burnt down by racist goons, and his parents died trying to break the door down to his room, with their skin having melted to the bone. Richie is the only one that hasn't been haunted, but he admits to being terrified of clowns.  The kids go to Bill's garage where they look over a map of Derry through a projector. They see that the sewers are linked to the Neibolt house, where IT lives. The projector then starts working itself, showing pictures of Bill and Georgie with their parents, but with Pennywise's face appearing over their mother. They knock the projector over, but it keeps playing until Pennywise fully emerges from the screen and tries to get the kids. They manage to get out of the garage before he can harm them.  The Losers go to the Neibolt house to face IT head-on. Bill, Richie, and Eddie enter the house while the others stay outside as lookouts. Richie sees a missing poster of himself and he freaks out, but Bill reminds him it's not real. Eddie gets separated from his friends when Pennywise finds him. He falls through the floor and lands in the kitchen, breaking his arm. Bill and Richie try to reach him through three doors. The first door they open reveals a headless girl. The second door traps Richie inside with a room full of clown dolls. He sees a coffin with a dummy of himself in it. He shuts it, and Pennywise jumps out. He tries to attack Richie, but he runs out of the room. Pennywise returns his attention to Eddie, but Bill and Richie get to him before the clown eats him. Beverly then shows up to drive a spear through Pennywise's head, forcing him to retreat.  Eddie's mom forbids the Losers from hanging out with him after she sees his broken arm. Bill and Richie then get into a fight when Richie says this whole pursuit of Georgie has nearly gotten them killed. The Losers part ways as the other boys are too terrified to keep going.  It's now August, and the kids have continued going about their lives. Eddie goes to the pharmacy to pick up his asthma medication, only for Gretta (who works behind the counter) to tell him that they are placebos. She then writes ""LOSER"" on his arm cast.  Henry is with Vic and Belch shooting things with his dad's gun. He orders Belch to bring him a cat to shoot, but Officer Bowers shows up to take the gun from Henry. He then shoots the ground around Henry's feet to humiliate him in front of his friends and expose him as a coward. Later, Henry sees a red balloon on his mailbox. Inside is a knife, sent by IT. He goes inside as his father is asleep with the TV on. On the screen appears a woman with children, all urging Henry to kill his father. He does so by sticking the knife in his neck and letting him bleed out. The kids on TV (all of IT's victims) then start chanting ""KILL THEM ALL! KILL THEM ALL!""

Filmen handlade i stort s√§tt om n√•gra k√•ta minder√•riga ungdomar och clownen d√∂k upp med on√∂digt h√∂ga ljudeffekter emellan√•t. En minder√•rig fjortis som legat med halva skolan och en grupp k√•ta minder√•riga n√∂rdar som var fulare i k√§ften √§n en stereotypisk sj√∂kapten. Och det fanns knappt n√•gra vuxna i filmen som gjorde att det hela k√§ndes v√§ldigt konstigt. Dessutom inneh√∂ll filmen en del scener om incest samt pedofili som hade f√∂rsk√∂nats till roliga scener.

2017-11-20T00:14:11,"It is an average supernatural horror movie based on the novel by Stephen King about 7 outsiders learning to be brave in order to fight the unfeasible odds for a usual objective. As I was watching the movie, I admired the great story, the charming cinematography, the marvelous score, and the friendly performances lead by Jaeden Lieberher, Finn Wolfhard, Jack Dylan Grazer, and Wyatt Oleff to name a few. To me, It felt more like a charming adaptation of a coming of age novel like Holes, or The Outsiders because I was disappointed that director Andy Muschietti didn‚Äôt let the horror elements reach their full potential like Matt Reeves did with Let Me In or like Sam Raimi did with the birth of Doc Ock scene in Spider-Man 2. The scares in It are too light, but that being said, Bill Skarsg√•rd gives an outstanding performance as It / Pennywise the Dancing Clown.

I'm sorry, but no clown will ever be as despair-inflicting and psychotically intimidating as Heath Ledger's Joker. He actually didn't give a rip when someone didn't fear him but thrived off of people realizing what darkness they truly were under the fake smiles. Unlike this Pennywise, Joker had no limits that little kids could easily find to beat him with. No, Joker (not the Leto) would've given the town the small push of gravity  that would've properly sent them into the chaos that Pennywise failed at trying to accomplish. The real believable monsters are those that can show the audience that they really aren't that different from them. #Hewasthebetterclassofcriminal",0,0,BigRed Nebraska94,xKJmEC5ieOk,-0.050378787878787884,2018-03-08 01:47:41,False,False
