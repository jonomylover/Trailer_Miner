2018-07-06T13:08:27,"First of all, this is not a copy of Harry Potter, if anything Rowling got Harry Potter ideas from this book series which was written in the 1970s.  I've read the book the movie gets it's name from, and it looks like the movie changed it quite a bit.  Cate Blanchett's character, Mrs. Zimmerman, is supposed to be old and very wrinkled.  The boy character, Lewis, is supposed to be overweight, shy, awkward, and not athletic at all.  There is no tentacle monster living in the closet, no attacking pumpkins, and no creepy puppet people(although that is pretty freaky and cool).  Lewis never begs to be taught magic, but is allowed to read certain books, but not others.  There is an ominous clock that can be heard ticking. Uncle Jonathan and Mrs. Zimmerman do wondrous and frightening magic.  There is evil lurking to destroy them, and perhaps the world???  Lewis' adventures take place in the late 1940's, so there would be no black kids in his school.  If they wanted to change things, maybe change the time setting of the movie and make it take place in the modern era??  That way Lewis' friend, Rose Rita, could legitimately be of any race, which would be unlikely in 1948.  Maybe it is picky, but Hollywood has to change things for no good reason.  I think they did good job overall with the feel of the book.  Hopefully it will still be close enough to be good.  I highly recommend read the John Bellairs series, even as adults they are fun!",0,1,William,uIlx5-aGq_A,0.05702380952380952,2018-07-06 13:08:27,True,True

2018-08-22T08:56:03,"I really hate to say this because I'm a big fan of the acting talents of all the people present, and I don't know enough about the source material to be hyped up by concept of this being made alone, but this movie appears to fail by way of the very message it intends to give:   ""I can give you the right books, teach you the right spells, but that last 1%, that's up to you.""  That last 1% is the magic part, see?  The actual visual effects are such shit that you are completely taken out of the movie.   The overall humorous tone to the magical world at times has the potential to be charming, and I see Jack Black and Cate Blanchett conveying this as perfectly as they possibly could have....while reacting to a green screen (possibly within a green screen room) to what appears to the audience as a much too obviously cartoon, overly animated LSD apparition. I had to check myself.  Visual effects don't count for everything but it's is a talent that is very difficult to teach. As a person who has only dabbled in effects in the smallest possible of ways; rotoscoping or key framing animation for hours with little to show for it, I can say this is a very technical and precision-based task that being proficient at technically will not give you that last bit of talent or intuition that can ever be taught. Making a movie, too, is this way, and we can see how efforts have changed over the years to favor a less messy, less risky world of visual effects that is just shy of being a completely robotic process that lacks that element of real life earthy chaos.   So went the ways of Ninja Turtles, so went the ways of Ghostbusters, both of which were disappointing for different reasons, but no one could quite say why.  With the above statement in mind, as well as my first, I will say that my favorite thing about this trailer is the acting talents of those seen, and that this isn't something I immediately knew the course of.

In the film you'll see masonic/satanic symbolisms like pentagrams, the evil hand, some dumb girl doing the 666 sign with both hands supposedly signifying the kids glasses, you'll see goats(because that's not reperencing baphomet who just happened to also be a goat, oh wait, it is), pyramids with eyes in the centre(both reversed and singular, referencing the law of reversals), devil faces, creepy sexual lines of dialogue ""come toss me one"" from a CHILD WTF, dragons (another god that some of these mentally ill people worship), sun worship, skull symbols representing the secret society and the obsessions with death, magic 8 balls to really drive the desensitisation train home. Be aware of these things, as the longer we do nothing about these force feeding of their satanism, the more it'll come into the open and before you know it your children will go missing and be  sacrificed. And if you think I'm joking just research all these symbols, particularly Alistair crowleys works and you'll see they aren't in this movie as a coincidence.

While I like the Fantasic Beasts series, this movie pushed WAY past paganism and the occult.   There's a child cutting himself & pouring blood on a pentagram, and a demon licking blood from a man's hand.
