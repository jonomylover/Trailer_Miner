Seeing it for the second time, we see Diana's sense of duty, the warrior, the compassion she feels for the world and at the start, the pain of walking away from it all. Etta Candy is funny, Steve will undoubtedly provide humour and some of the action. We see enough of Diana to know what she's like. We know Danny Huston's German officer is going to be an antagonist but we don't know WHO he is, nor what he plans to achieve, David Thewlis is still absent which means they are probably saving him for the movie. At this point Danny is either Ares/Steppenwolf and David is Zeus/Steppenwolf.   We see brighter scenes with more colour, great action and what may be the new tone of the DCEU. This is the movie to make or break the DCEU and I cannot wait to see the final trailer and then the movie itself.

I kinda supported you during Suicide squad because you gave me more deadshot in trade to more Joker, I mean , come on, deadshot was awesome! Will Smith killed it as deadshot. Also Margot Robbie, my crush. Anyway, Patty Jenkins is great and thank God, she left Thor movies. Please don't do injustice to Patty. Don't betray wonderwoman cuz she's bisexual. Do justice and a good justice league movie. Don't do injustice. The only injustice you are allowed to do is a movie with the same title. Who's up for crisis.?

Batman glaring at his Batsuit and Jeremy Irons  being all like ""you're consumed with rage"" and shit. It's going to be AWESOME!"" --- every DC fan 3 years ago.   What I'm REALLY wanting to see is WB realizing that  letting the suits edit these films into slapdash theatrical cuts compacted to fit more screenings, ISN'T a good idea. It's seriously damaged the brand.   How do you fuck up Superman and Batman first forging their legendary bond on the big screen, a bond upon which much of comic culture is BUILT in the shadow of? How do you fuck that up? With a weak script weakened even further with horrendous corporate editing and story direction that is driven by pie-chart graphs the studio put together.  Suicide Squad could have been the superhero genre's Silence of the Lambs but they played it safe and made the child murderers and domestic terrorists lovable rogues with hearts of gold when they should have been portrayed as pure evil scum who only a psycho in a Batsuit could bring down.   I want WW to destroy the global box office. She's a trinity member. She deserves the best as it's the characters first big screen outing. I just know there was lots of cool shit in those B v S and SS trailers too.

2016-11-03T18:03:58,"The war was terrible, but the Germans were not the ultimate evil the entente made her in history. While the next quote has it's fair share of propaganda, it's pointing out Germany's outlook of the war, which was silenced in the victory of the entente in 1918 and the treaty of Versailles:  In order to appreciate what Germany has accomplished during two years of war, one must to recall to mind the great"" expectations which her enemies attached to this war, into which their powerful coalition for years of political scheming and thorough military preparations had enmeshed the prosperous empire at the outset, the avowed purpose of Germany's enemies  was to annihilate her,  her army, her fleet, commerce and her industry. France, hoped to regain Alsace-Lorrien, Russia hoped to conquer the provinces of east and west Prussia and Posen which were likely to recieve the ""Blessings of Russian Culture"" Austria-Hungary was to be dismembered, the Balkans States were to be rendered Tributary to the Czar, Constantinople and the Dardanelles were to be added to the Romanov's dominions. As for England, she deliberately entered this war because she thought she would run small risk. The world will remember the vain glorious way in which Germany's enemies foretold that before long their armies will meet at the Heart of Germany, where Cossacks were parading the streets in Berlin and Indian Lancers and Gurkhas would stroll through the parks of Potsdam, Germany would soon be Paralyzed, nay, would soon be passing away. Such were the expectations of the enemies attacking us from all sides, Germany was drawn into a war of self-defense. And today, how to Matters stand? Excepting one small corner of the empire, the only enemies on German soil are vast numbers of prisoners of war, the War is fought on enemy soil Germany and hr allies occupy 3 independent kingdoms, they hold vast areas of enemy territory, in east and west, they hold these territories firmly, without fear of losing them by force of arms. Consider the efforts our enemies made on the western front in their unsuccessful attempts at lusee and Chapmainge last autumn: suffered terrible losses and made no headway. In the spring, Germany took up the offensive against Verdun, step by step, we steadily gaining ground. The french positions are crumbling away one by one. Thanks to the genius of Hindenburg, east Germany is no longer threatened by Russians, Last year, with cooperation with our valiant ally, Austria Hungary, we drove back the Russians overwhelming their armies, for two months it is true that the Russians resumed offensive but have not succeeded in breaking through our lines.

2016-11-03T18:12:17,Now Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice was a total train wreck... No offense to all train wrecks! And Justice League looks like an awkward mess from all i've seen of it. But this movie actually looks pretty darn compitent! And i'm actually hyped for this film. Looks interesting and fun. Wich in the end is what you want from this kind of film. So let's hope the trailers are an accurate representation of what we are getting. Because atleast we'll have something to prais the DCEU. Man of Steel in my opinion is the best Superman movie we have ever gotten. It's pretty good. Suicide Squad is also pretty darn good in my opinion. Atleast it was fun trough and trough. So far only shit with Batman in it has seemed poor... With Batman as a central character that is. Hmmm... It's odd since i like the new Batman. O_o You know if you can ignore the fact that he kills everyone and everything he sees. x),0,0,Monkey Powerkey,1Q8fG0TtVAY,0.1690498737373737,2016-11-03 18:12:17,True,True

And Batman is EVERYONE's favorite and has had more than 8 feature length films in my lifetime, so I'm kinda tired of him. I just love Wonder Woman's style of fighting and the way she kicks ass. I've also been a sucker for Greek Mythology since I was a little kid, so that adds even more to it.

2016-11-03T18:36:07,"I know this has been said before, but screw it I'll say it myself:  I consider myself a fan of both Marvel and DC. However, I've found that Warner Bros' attempts to cash in on the success of the MCU have led to three complete messes of films due to bad writing and inconsistent editing, despite the admittedly decent cinematography and acting (most of the time). By and large, I think Marvel has been making superior movies for the past eight years with their own peaks and nadirs, but still more enjoyable to watch than the DC Extended Universe.  Batman v. Superman is a dead horse beaten to a bloody pulp already, but the fact remains that it still suffered from a dumb plot that utterly failed to capture the meaning behind the Bats/Supes fight in The Dark Knight Returns in any capacity, shoddy editing (especially in the theatrical cut, though the Ultimate Edition fixed this to an extent), weak performances by everyone who wasn't named Ben Affleck, Jeremy Irons or Gal Gadot, and a tacked on climax with Doomsday that was used FAR too early in the franchise for the Death of Superman storyline to have any kind of weight to it.  Suicide Squad, meanwhile, suffered from a plot with more holes in it than an everyday M. Night Shyamalan film, imbalanced characterization for the main characters (anyone who wasn't Deadshot, Rick Flagg, Harley Quinn, or Amanda Waller was almost completely sidelined), constant focus on probably THE worst Joker performance I've ever seen in any DC media, and the simple fact that it served no purpose than to give us that one scene at the very end where Bruce gets the files for Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash from Waller, which probably could have happened in a mid-credits scene in BvS if they wanted to. Oh wait, they don't do mid-credits scenes, because that would make them too similar to Marvel, AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT NOW CAN WE!  However, this trailer has me legitimately hyped. Gadot was one of the best parts about BvS (despite her abysmal total screen time), and this trailer got me excited for her chance in the spotlight as Wonder Woman.

I have no fucking idea who the main villain is yet, so thaaaank you for giving us just enough without telling us the whole movie like BVS trailers did with Doomsday!!!... So now, I see Doctor Poison for sure now but she is just a human, so who is WW grabbing with her lasso and smashing him/her to the ground full force like that??? She couldn¬¥t been fighting a human, so wtf??? And then... we see that bullet getting passed her and possibly killing that other amazon, why didn¬¥t she stop it if she is stopping bullets at other points of the trailer???? Then we see her riding a horse at some point, so at that moment she couldn¬¥t leap or fly cause why would she need a horse, but then I am almost 100% positive she was FLYING at the end of the trailer, it didn¬¥t look like a leap, so, maybe she CAN fly and that¬¥s how she got there in time to save Batman in BVS and we just didn¬¥t see it yet???... could we maybe get to see how the Gods grant her new abilities throughout the movie???

But, I always give the movie a fair chance when I see it. I am really hoping this is gonna be new epic beginning for Diana Prince/Wonder Woman.

Seeing this clip doesn't do her justice. No one can fill her boots, period, end of story. This reminds me of when they tried to have Coy & Vance fill the General Lee while Bo & Luke left the Dukes Of Hazard back in the day. Granted, that was the small screen, but you get the picture. Sometimes its better off to just leave well enough alone & that was one of em much like this is another. I can also remember when they had Burt Reynolds trying too play Boss Hogg on the Dukes, Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, & that skank Jessica Simpson as Daisy. Are you serious? And it bombed. You CAN'T replace legends of TV like the late Sorrell Booke aka Boss Hogg, the late Denver Pyle aka Uncle Jesse, & thank God she's still with us Catherine Bach aka Daisy Duke. And the SAME can be said with Lynda Carter. Not taking anything away from the woman in this clip, but its like I said, Lynda Carter IS Wonder Woman & Wonder Woman IS Lynda Carter. It BEGINS & it ENDS right there. Bottom line, end of story. Like I said, sometimes its better off to just leave well enough alone.

Do you think about that? I bet not but we all are in a hurry to bash Zach when it is not his fault to begin with.

He WANTS to join the fight, goes from Zero to Hero, loses close friend, never gives up hope etc etc and his villain is essentially his opposite.   WW is a citizen of ""kick your ass"" island and is completely unaware of the war, the only reason I'm guessing she wants to go is because it looks like they killed one of the other Amazon's (looks like she's not used to death for some reason)   even had they decided to go the route of using ww2 here I still think there would be enough to differentiate the stories greatly; they're really different character driven narratives.   also I feel like given the trailers introductory little blurb from her, that following the war she's gonna lose faith in humanity and possibly also be unable to return to her home island either.  really psyched for this!",1,0,Gill Diaz,1Q8fG0TtVAY,0.04034090909090909,2016-11-04 09:06:11,True,True

2016-11-04T17:24:00,Came to watch an incredible trailer and an important mark in DC history only to have the comment section be littered with incomprehensible Marvel fanboys hating a film with no valid reason. Y'all are making it seem as if though yall are jealous that Warner Brothers and the dceu are finally getting it together. Jealous that this movie is going to work wonders at the box office. Jealous that this movie looks fucking insane. We aren't pulling a Captain America. If so show me where. This is set in WW1. WW1. DO YALL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WW1 AND WW2. SHE IS A DEMI GOD WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE A FUCKING SHIELD. HOW IS HER HAVING A SHIELD RELATE TO THE FACT THAT SHE'S COPYING CAP. YALL ARE JUST SOME CHEWED UP PIECE OF GUM STUCK ON A SHOE GETTING DRAGGED THROUGH SHIT AFTER WATCHING THIS TRAILER AND STILL MAKING A RETARTED ASS EXCUSE ON WHY IT SUCKS. I've gone to see if the same hate resonates on any other Marvel trailer and guess what? I don't see any DC fanboys calling your films shit without having seeing them. So please do us all a favor Marvel fanboys. FUCK OFF. I bet most of yall are probably 13. PATHETIC.,1,0,KingsJoker,1Q8fG0TtVAY,-0.1796875,2016-11-04 17:24:00,True,True

I'm not going to watch Justice League Part 1, nor anything coming after it, if Wonder Woman sucks. I'm sick and tired of Zack Snyder banking on the cinematic universe reputation that Marvel garnered, but there is a reason why Marvel made it successful... They made actually universally accepted and good movies. Movies that know exactly what it wants to be, and not trying to be something it's not. After Man of Steel, Batman V Superman aka Pot vs Kettle, and Suicide Squad... I would really like an actually good movie out of DC for once. I don't go see DC, expecting it to be just like another Marvel movie. I go to see DC, to see DC films like The Dark Knight, or even the Christopher Reeves Superman Films. Back when DC did know how to make a good movie, and Marvel didn't have the Cinematic Universe to go on. So, if it turns out to be yet another polarizing movie with most people hating it, and since there will be feminists possibly defending it, people who actually like it and try to tell us you have to watch it multiple times to understand. If that's the case, then it really doesn't make sense. And how much do you want to bet that there's going to be an extended version that's only slightly better and the obligatory R rated cut? Cause Zack Snyder doesn't believe in the R rated theatrical release...

These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn‚Äôt handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced ‚Äúmissing‚Äù from the Pentagon‚Äôs coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001. Luckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI‚Äôs lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history. The investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover up from start to finish. It was based on testimony extracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed. It failed to mention the existence of WTC7, Able Danger, Ptech, Sibel Edmonds, OBL and the CIA, and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening. It was lied to by the Pentagon, the CIA, the Bush Administration and as for Bush and Cheney‚Ä¶well, no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret, off the record, not under oath and behind closed doors. It didn‚Äôt bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of ‚Äúlittle practical significance‚Äú. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims‚Äô family members‚Äô questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were ‚Äúa failure of imagination‚Äù because ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ‚Äù except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.""",1,0,John F.

The sword the guy is wielding near the end appears to be Diana's own sword, so she was likely disarmed at some point before that scene, and was now in the process of reacquiring it.  Certainly she has to have been on the short end of the stick at some point in the movie for proper audience anxiety and a situation to dig herself out of (78 Supes had the kryptonite necklace around his neck), and the sword being in the villains' possession hints at that.  99% certain she is not flying at the end, but has just reached the apogee of a huge jump and then the lightening may from that point contribute in suspending her  She's charging past/thru quite a bit of rapidly erupting/collapsing material before the big jump so perhaps the crossed bracers are in the process of trying to absorb the brunt of some massive energy outburst from below  Would love to see a scene in Justice League where she and the Flash are competing at bullet time reactions - he'd readily win but she would be seen to  be at a not-insignificant speed, and anyone else in the room would appear to be frozen",0,0,Dagget Burmese,1Q8fG0TtVAY,0.22602040816326527,2016-11-06 04:29:29,True,True

2016-11-06T11:55:10,"I want this movie to be a hit because , One , Gal Gadot is amazing in the role of Princess Diana/ Diana Prince /Wonder Woman  and for me the reason I said she is amazing is because her take on Diana made me forget Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman while watching BVS and these trailers, her acting has been trashed by some but if you really take the time to watch it, you can see she is one amazing face actor and does does a Really good job talking acting IMO.    Two , Both trailers for Wonder Woman  IMO show Patty Jenkins has really made a great Movie as long as the script is as good as the visual effects and attitude and no one can say this movie is too dark from the trailers.   What I find funny is people want superhero movies to be masterpieces like gone with the wind . Take these movies for what they are, movies to watch your fav hero kick butt, not make you go home in awe and amazement   BVS was no Masterpiece , the mathra part was pretty stupid but it's not gone with the wind.  Marvel is only better in they seem to avoid small dumb details like the martha but I got where that was going, they just rushed the movie and should had work the martha scene out better but for me that was the only part that was stupid, yes Wonder Woman could had killed doomsday by cutting his head off with her sword but forever reason, Superman had to die so it has to be that way and marvel movies are guilty of the same plot holes for ending a movie as above but critics seem to ignore that but I get it, one mistake vs too many mistakes.

She has so many different backstories to choose from or draw inspiration from, but instead of leaving the island to see the glory that is the world and going from fry cook to (honorary) ambassador as she sees the best and worst of humanity, all while holding onto the ideals represented by the gifts bestowed upon her, we get invaders with guns as a 'call to adventure'. Sure, okay.  I'm entirely for a dark and dramatic storyline, but levity and pacing is needed for such stories lest you end up with Liefeld-esque narratives. In other words, all drama is depressing, but drama mixed with comedy or exciting action (requiring achievements and an overall sense of victory) is gripping and even more dramatic. To put it in another frame, if you are watching a fight, it's more gripping and heartbreaking when they both fight well then one loses/dies than it is when one guy mercilessly pounds someone much weaker.  I will say that the music in the trailer was amazing.",0,0,Professor Persona,1Q8fG0TtVAY,0.09833333333333334,2016-11-07 05:06:26,True,True

This movie is going to end at 60% on RT, not good but also not bad.

The movie is so dark and fast with phony looking backgrounds and computer generated sequences that it reminds me of the kids video games.¬† Sadly enough too, the woman in the title role can't hold a candle to the natural beauty that Lynda Carter has always had then and now. Lynda had the most innocent but beautiful face ever to grace the screen. Her costumes were made of beautiful colors and the right materials to be flattering and sexy without adding sex to the show.¬†So I will not sit through and give this movie a chance or buy into it. Instead I will continue to watch the original tv Wonder Woman on my DVD set and go back to the time when quality was much better than quantity and when lessons could be learned and super powers were used with compassion.

Britain is always the bad guys and we believe they're the good guys because they taught us how to turn your enemy into a monster.  even Belgium attacked Germany and just wound up getting their asses kicked. the only country that didn't completely instigate Germany in ww1 was France.

2017-06-04T01:55:02,"*SPOILERS*  Not a bad film. Certainly the best of the DCEU so far (I haven't seen Suicide Squad). Here's what I would change:  1. The Beginning needs to be better. It doesn't really get interesting until after they leave the island. It felt so cliched in the beginning with lines like, ""She's a child,"" and, ""She won't be a child forever.""  2. If Steve Trevor really is British (I don't recall him indicating he was American in any way like he is in the comics) then he should have a British accent.  3. Since war is a big theme in the film, it would've been good to see her accept having to make a Sophie's Choice in war. She goes around saying, ""This is wrong,"" a little too much in the film and it gets tired. And then, when confronted with a problem, she's able to solve it (like the trench warfare).  It would've been great if she was shown to be forced to have to make such a choice and weeps as a result. She then realizes that this is the truth of war that her mother warned her about.  4. I would've preferred she defeated Ares the same way WW defeated him in the George Perez reboot. That was so much more meaningful.  5.

I'm seventeen, and all I wanted in that moment was to *be* Wonder Woman.  When I said all this to my dad, ending with, ""from now on, I'm training like Wonder Woman"", he told me that what I was feeling was how he used to feel about superheroes when he was four. And how my brother felt about superheroes when he was six. I've been watching Iron Man Armoured Adventures and Justice League and reading Spiderman and Captain America comics with my brothers since I was old enough to understand the stories, and it's taken me until I'm seventeen to feel the same way they felt from the very start.

The whole movie is a worship for a beautiful woman with silly dialogues and extra scenes with no point (aka the man who sells ice-cream in the train station during the war!). I don't even want to mention the scene where they drink their beers and she is replacing the cup on every second. Not even Scorsese does these mistakes in his movies.

That's amazing by anyone's standards even for Marvel. Having only dropped 30% on average is fantastic.   Only Star Wars Rogue one had similar week on week earnings drop around 30% or so. While i don't think Wonder Woman will quite match The Dark Knight.   It will certainly be among the best of the genre to date. A huge accomplishment and rightfully deserved.

Now, I find this disgusting  because people are crying at the fact that wonder woman is saving WW1.  Now you cry! How much you wanna bet you fell asleep during the memorial day assembly at your school which remembers the real people who sacrificed their lives, not a made up comic book character. Seriously, millions of soldiers died in the trenches of WW1, but you don't care. However!, now that a woman is the one who saved the day you are crying. And it's not even a cry of sorrow it's a cry of joy. If you want something to cry about, watch saving private ryan, the most realistic war movie there is. why would you cry about a fake magical girl from a magical island who came and saved the day with her magic rope, and magical shield,  but while watching the movie, while watching the scene where she climbs out of the trench on her own with her magical shield, you don't have any thought of the 38 million that died the exact same way she climbed out of that trench. I'm saying this about the movie because it's the only super hero movie that takes place in a war (or the only one I know of), and also, I don't think anyone has ever cried watching any other super hero film. I'm not saying all this because I hate woman, (although I do think that's the only reason why people are crying is because it's a woman super hero), trust me, I would have said the exact same thing if it were a male super hero and people are crying. But I don't think anyone would have cried if it were a male super hero.",0,0,no name,1Q8fG0TtVAY,0.042829457364341086,2017-06-29 04:03:30,False,True

2017-11-09T10:58:44,"This movie is so underrated on IMDB with only 7.6/10. I would give the movie a 5/5 in the aesthetic part because of the perfect actor choices, flawless backgrounds, fit to environment dressing and makeup.   On the theme side, comparing this movie to other superhero movies, Wonder Woman is the first female superhero movie, which is a clear example of females' rise in status in our society. It also has an anti-war theme which is rare in the action movie genre. These political-correct themes give a whole lot of meaning beyond just the movie. Thus, I would give it a 4.5/5 on the story part. 9.5/10 in total.",1,0,Bo Zhang,1Q8fG0TtVAY,0.26875,2017-11-09 10:58:44,False,False

2017-11-17T03:50:34,üò± when Wonder Woman came out to the  movie theater I could not wait to go see this.I was actually looking forward to go see this. But then 45 minutes into the movie I was very disappointed. it wasn't what I thought it would be and I walked out. I was hoping that I would like this movie but didn't. Now they're supposed to be making a Wonder Woman part 2 ain't going to say it. Like I said I was very disappointed in Wonder Woman the movie. Well maybe if they did a better story line or put more to the story line maybe then I probably would have liked it. I will say this much I got more of a joy and watching Supergirl the TV series instead of watching Wonder Woman the movie.

In my opinion the independence should not appear in violence and war: the woman is just fighting alone against herself, her 'I',  against the limit of her body's power and against the stabile anti-feminism of the sociaty where she is living. The real independence should be the skillfull of leadership, should be the mental influence to the rest of the world that the WOMEN practise. The independence should begin in heads and in the way of domino effect. An independent woman can lead men fight for her, she must not stay alone while all weapons are thrown to her.
