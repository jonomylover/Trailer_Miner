2017-02-10T20:17:34,"The folks at Pure Flix have this weird misconception about what Atheism is.  In this film, in God's Not Dead, and in several of their other films, their Atheist characters are depicted as people who have lost their faith due to some personal trauma, and who find their faith once again through their experiences in the film, generally by being talked into it.  The problem is that repeating this character type over and over again teaches the Christians watching these films that Atheists are all spiritually broken people that can and should be converted and brought back into the fold with a bit of convincing, and that's not really what's going on with most Atheists.  It's bound to create situations where Christians try to convert Atheist friends, Atheist family members, and utterly ruin their relationships with them.

Watts, headed a research project to determine if Christ's disciples encoded the New Testament with clues about the SHROUD OF TURIN. What he discovered was an ingenious tapestry of null ciphers & jargon codes, concealed in the Bible's plaintext that camouflaged a ciphertext. They were arranged in diffused layers of cryptic data; describing the Shroud of Turin in intermittent signals, symbolic references, disguised metaphors & phonetically spelled ciphers. Their common denominator was JESUS' IMAGE ON THE SHROUD! Watts used the same code-breaking methods the CIA & NSA use when cracking codes; such as pattern recognition, quantitative data analysis, detection of graphical deception, cluster analysis, data mining, frequency analysis, camouflage signaling & correspondence analysis. Jesus' disciples layered their words with patterns of direct & indirect HINTS about the Shroud that have remained INVISIBLE to the clergy & Shroud experts, who lacked cryptology skills.  Watts also points to Old Testament verses that cloaked the Shroud in the ABSTRACT of Scripture. He says the Shroud Codes were no accident; they were there all the time, waiting for us like hidden time capsules. It was the safest way to write about Christ's glorified image because it subtly obscured the medium on which it existed: a shroud. The SCIENCE OF CRYPTOLOGY proves the Shroud was the SAME LINEN CLOTH the gospels spoke of 14 TIMES after the crucifixion. J.R. also reveals the 9-11 HARBINGERS ALL THE PROPHECY EXPERTS MISSED: 3,000 people were killed in Exodus 32 in 1 day for their idolatry of 1 Golden Calf Idol. In 2000, New York City promoted the SAME idolatry with the New Millennium Cow Parade of 500 such idols. On 9-11, ANOTHER 3,000 people were slain in 1 day.

2017-04-21T09:13:50,"J.D. Rucker  April 16, 2017  ‚ÄúThe Case for Christ‚Äù is a High-Quality Movie in a Genre known for Rotten Reviews: Being a Christian in Hollywood can be difficult. There aren‚Äôt a ton  of movies being made today that fit in with a believing actor‚Äôs moral  compass. Moreover, there‚Äôs a stigma attached to many actors who  willingly profess their faith just as there‚Äôs a stigma against  conservatives. As such, the average Christian-themed movie is pretty  poorly done from a purely critical perspective. The messages can be  great, but the delivery can be lackluster. Neither Kirk Cameron nor  Nicolas Cage could make one of the most popular Christian book series of  all time successful. The Case for Christ  is different. I was shocked when I saw that it received a 77% critical  response on Rotten Tomatoes until I realized it was only reviewed by 13  critics. Go figure. Nonetheless, it was encouraging so I took my wife to  see it last night. We were familiar with Lee Strobel‚Äôs journey from  truth-seeking news reporter to truth-seeing evangelist and author, so we  didn‚Äôt go for the sake of the story. As highly selective adults who  have chosen to restrict our movie viewing to ones that fit our worldview  (or that at least don‚Äôt attempt to trash it), we wanted to see if it  was the rare ‚Äúwell made‚Äù Christian movie. We were pleased with the results. Both the acting and the cinematography were very good. They delivered  1980 about as well as big-budget films, 70s¬†red Camaro and all.  Nobody‚Äôs going to win an Oscar from this movie, but compared to the  poorly crafted Christian movies of today that have good messages but are  artistically weak, this was a real winner.¬†Mike Vogel  delivered the right mix of skepticism and intellect. He was believable  as he struggled in a quest to debunk the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I  wasn‚Äôt expecting it based upon some of his previous performances in  cultural garbage flicks like¬†Cloverfield and¬†The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but he found his groove with this role. While far from being a critical masterpiece, this will hopefully  bring more attention to the quality of Christian movies. They don‚Äôt have  to look like they were made by a high school film studies class, nor  does the dialogue have to sound like carefully crafted proselytizing  disguised as robotic conversations. There needs to be a gelling of  message and art that gets people not only interested in seeing a movie  but that compels them to recommend it.  Hollywood is a cesspool of left-wing manipulation of progressive  propaganda. As a society, we‚Äôve fought through to make  conservative-themed movies like¬†American Sniper¬†and¬†Zero Dark Thirty critical and box office successes. Now we need to do the same for Christian-themed movies. The Case for Christ is a step in the right direction. We need more of them.

Doing anything (good or bad)  in the name of a God doesn't make sense to me. Why can't people just be good or evil out of their own will? The only thing I believe in and care about is the human moral compass. I no longer call myself an atheist but some might think I am worse because most atheist don't believe because there is a lack of proof.  I on the other hand am saying that I don't care  if Jesus revealed himself to me tomorrow, I don't see the point worshipping anything. If God does exist, really created life and Jesus died for our sins that's cool and everything. I would thank him and send him on his way to take a nap, because lord knows he needs it. If by some miracle there really is a God and that God would send a person that has lead a good and honest life to hell just because he didn't spend his whole life worshipping then thats some selfish and petty ass God, not the type of God I would like to follow anyway.  So pro tip for believers: don't tell people who don't believe in a god they wil go to hell for not believing because 1. It doesn't scare them and 2.

2017-08-07T04:14:58,"God created us, if you want proof of God, look in the mirror.  For those who ask, so God sat down mapped out our DNA, our universe, etc., etc., etc.  Maybe he did, just because it would be too large of a task for you, doesn't mean it was for God.  Obviously God is far more genius or powerful than any man, hence, why he was able to create the universe and map out the creation of life.  I really love the logic, it can't be proven, therefore it's false.  Not too far in the past, there were people who said the same about the earth being round.  It could not be proven, therefore, the earth was flat and anyone who believed otherwise was a fool and would fall off the edge of the earth if they walked far enough.  If you open your eyes and mind enough, you will see proof of God everywhere, including your mirror.  God is real, 100%.  Angels are real 100% and for those who have faith, those who trust God, our father, God and the Angels who he sends to be our guardians, are more than happy to make themselves known.  With love and faith and trust, pray and ye shall receive.  I have many times, and that's not science, it's not coincidence, it's God.  In fact, I have a friend who was an atheist.  Her life never seemed to go right.  Then one day, a year after her divorce from an abusive man who manipulated her into living a life of sin, claiming if she loved him, she would give him threesomes and attend private orgies; she met a man at her sister's birthday party.  He was a Marine on leave.  He was also a Christian.  They dated, and she began to attend, skeptically, his church.  She allowed herself to be welcomed into his church.  A year later they were married, and she became a devout Christian, and since she became a believer, she laughs at atheists, saying that every single thing she prayed for God answered.  A beautiful new home, and recently, a healthy beautiful baby girl.  She wrote me one day telling me that since she opened her heart and life to God, nothing but miracles have happened in her life, including the struggling baking business she tried to start with her first marriage, took off and she was even asked to be on their local morning news station to show how to make the perfect cupcake.  After she welcomed God into her life, her life has been one blessing after another, and now five years later, she still looks like the happiest woman in the world.  For those who think tragedy, war, etc., would not happen if there was a God, I've got a newsflash, God does not make any of that happen, he gave us free will, and we, stupid humans, make all the tragedy happen.  God put us here and gave us free will, he does not interfere with the stupid mistakes and ideas we create.  As for illnesses, like a child getting cancer, yes, it's sad, but maybe that's the life that child was meant to live in order to help find new cures, new treatments, etc.  We have the Amber Alert because little Amber was abducted and murdered.  Maybe that was her destiny, so other children could be saved.  An innocent child is murdered by a stray drive-by gang shooting.  It's heartbreaking, but maybe the child's destiny was to make sure a brother, or nephew, someone in that family does not go down the same path, but instead becomes someone who will fight to end the violence and save the lives of other innocent children.  Just because we don't understand God's plan, doesn't mean that God is either cruel or doesn't exist.  Finally, my dear atheists, your belief system is a religion, so please stop preaching that religion is stupid, because atheism is a religion, a religion of disbelief, but a religion nevertheless.",2,4,Eve Decker,rhe8KhSxWGo,0.09395830424056231,2017-08-07 04:14:58,False,False

If I had to describe it to a friend, I would say it is the story of one man with remarkably low standards for evidence on an unremarkable journey to shield himself from the obvious and glaring logical fallacies he manages to accept. In the end, he is able to overcome the demand for reason and evidence that even a child would demand before accepting the most extraordinary claims it is possible to imagine.¬†  If I applied the same threshold for accepting a supernatural claim as Lee used for Christian mythology, it is hard to imagine a supernatural claim I WOULDN'T accept as true.  I must confess, I enjoy watching these fanciful religious films which seek to portray skeptics and non-believers in ways they desperately would like them to be: arrogant and angry people who put on a masquerade of critical thinking, inevitably more satisfied by the theistic claims the more they are unpacked, instead of what is typically the case; they've never heard the ghost of a compelling argument or seen any reason to accept what would seem to be objectively inconsistent and absurd claims.

2018-01-05T22:12:15,"Modern Christianity is not true Christianity, the church has failed, the body of Christ has fallen asleep and the pastors are drunk, enslaved by their Flesh.  While the Athiest are blinded by their arrogance and ignorance, they lie to themselves and claim if evidence were to be provided they'd believe, and yet they do not pursue any evidence, they do not consider it, instead they mock it, reject it, and laugh at it. You tell us if you saw Jesus walk on water you'd believe, Fool! Even the Pharisee in Jesus time saw him heal blind men and lift up those who could not walk, did they not still cal Jesus a spawn of the devil? Did the rich man not refuse to follow Jesus because he loved his wealth more than salvation. You blindly lay in bed with ignorance, and because you count yourself wise, you refuse to see wisdom. With all your circular thinking, and half truths, it is easy to see your own fear and foolishness. Even if Jesus appeared to you and showed you Heaven itself, you'd reject him like the very people who saw him work miracles that countered every logical argument in those times.  The church has fallen and the lost remain lost, but the people will pay for the church's sin in the end, because people follow a misguided and false Gospel that teaches anything other than the love of Christ.  When the lost ask genuine questions in an attempt to find truth, the church puts them down and demonizes them, and when false believers say they speak for God, what other option do those same lost folk have other than to believe that false prophet.   The atheist may have sinned because of his unbelief, but it is the church of God who has failed to truly show his love and truth, and it is the church who will have blood in it's hands,  This modern Christianity is anything but Christian.   The early church was not divide, they did not close or kick out members of the church with struggles or lack of faith, they didn't raise money for buildings but instead for the poor and broken, they ate with sinners and welcomed them into the church. They didn't rebuke those true in faith, and they did not pride themselves for actions God himself did.   The Atheist may be a fool in rejecting the truth, but what other option does he have when the church of God is anything but Christ like. How can the church joyfully sing praise when the world itself says you look more like the devil and less like Jesus. And yet you Pharisee of our modern day reject even the rebuke of your own brothers and sisters in Christ.   God never died, he has not fallen, it is the church which has turned it's back on the Lord, and it shall be the first to pay.",0,1,E M,rhe8KhSxWGo,0.055352303523035204,2018-01-05 22:12:15,False,False

One of the misunderstandigs among American evangelical christians is that the world is divided is into 2 groups: Atheists and evangelical christians. The reality is much different, especially in Europe. There are dozens of religious beliefs here. Some people are very liberal christian, others are agnostics, a lot of people simply don't give a shit. You will find very little people who will say they are atheists. That is why this debate is so irrelevant for them, they realize that reality is not as black and white as evangelical christians want it to be. The idea that you will be send to heaven because of some thoughts you have in your brain is so ridiculous they wouldn't even think about it.   About the debate in the movie: That had absolutely nothing to do with objectivity. Only christian apologists are talking and Strobel asks questions no atheists would ever ask. Some of the arguments have been debunked a thousand times, but they are still used by apologists.

It doesn't mean Jesus or God doesn't exist, but personally I'm offended that the churches, the same one that harbored child molesters and rapists for, what, hundreds of years? Who paid them  off with (clearly) parishioner's money?   I've known many decent church people, but I don't buy the church thing. And I find it irritating that his experience was used to suck more people into that whole thing. God and Jesus don't have to have anything to do with that. I think it's better if they don't so we can stop the constant division of people based on it. JMO.   I think the money given churches should be given to the poor themselves. All they need is more gold chalices and more property. Meanwhile, feeding the homeless Wonder bread sandwiches and making them sit outside in the cold to eat them. I've watched it with my own eyes. One of two rich area churches that harbored child molesters. This is information easily found online because pastors don't switch parishes every few years. They tend to stay there many years. But, interestingly, EVERY child molester/rapist is here and there and all over the place...it's extremely offensive as hell. Protected by the church itself. Paying off their accusers. If THAT'S not giving someone reason to stop giving them money, I fail to see what could be. To want to believe and see all the evidence of cover-ups by them makes me sick.   And assuming God exists, that would be a great time for a good lightning strike, but nooooo...  I like the Lee character, but wow, this is an annoying movie. Give me the cheesy Christian movie about the firefighters or the one with the cops any day. I didn't walk away annoyed by either of those. I don't buy that prayer helps. Look at all the decent people who deserve their prayer answered and got zero or worse for their troubles? The rapists and child molesters...and a Chicago favorite, the Our lady of Angel's fire, where 92 children and 3 nuns were trapped and burned to death in 1958. The church (and no, I will not capitalize it) covered it up and hid their own fault. 1. They had a kid who was a known firebug and very likely set the fire under the stairs. 2. Is the church exempt from having to follow housekeeping/fire code laws as well? Apparently so, because anyone else's head would have been on a rope for leaving trash in the hall that way AND having an open stairwell that caused those deaths in the first place. And locked gates and too tall of windows...and on and on. I've spoken to people who were there. They CERTAINLY didn't deserve to have their childhood friends burn to death in front of them. I think its despicable for that church to take ZERO responsibility for any of it. No wonder it ruined entire neighborhoods.   I mean, I'll leave that door open, but I'm dubious at best. I've seen some things that were very unique that would lead one to belief, but I'm.still always going to be vehement against the lying, buying off, bulling, covering-up, rapist/molester-harboring church.

The idea of ""something coming from nothing"" is actually the only logical explanation for God as Creator. Let me explain:  Think of the entire world as a painting, like the Mona Lisa. The Painter, Leonardo DaVinci, is the creator. The world didn't come from nothing, just as the paint in the painting didn't come from nothing. But it came from a different KIND of substance, one that, if Mona as the paint in the painting was able to think for herself, she would be unable comprehend this kind of substance because the paint of her own world is all she knows.  In order for the painter to be the creator of the painting, he has to exist outside the painting. Time, space, and matter are the governing foundation of our existence, but they do not apply to God because he created them. To say that God has to be bound to creation in order to be a creator, is to say that Leonardo DaVinci would need to be made of canvas-bound paint in order to be a painter.",0,2,Emamae,rhe8KhSxWGo,0.21923076923076923,2018-10-19 00:11:33,False,False

The first thing a person notices, when they watch trailers for them, is the utter non-recognizability  of both the actors and the directors of these genre of films. Every Christian film ends up with actors/actresses/directors that have either no other current body of work, or perhaps they had film parts over 20 years ago. So, why is this?  Well, it's because, in a nutshell, that Hollywood despises Christianity. The vast majority of the people in the film industry simply hate Christians, and so they refuse to  produce films that even acknowledge them.    And, because they despise Christians, they assume the rest of the country does as well, and they assume there is zero marketability for Christian-based films. Thus, we end up with  small-time directors, producers, and third-rate actors, using indie film companies, making any and all Christian films.   And, this is absurd.  In the USA, there are 240 MILLION Christians.

2019-07-06T01:50:48,"Just scrolling through the comments and 90 percent of the people commenting or viewing this are atheists. And they hate this a lot too. Brothers and sisters we have to pray for them. Science itself contradicts itself. The Big Bang theory is not acceptable because an explosion will make things go flying in all directions not form a creation. If you ran two cars together at 150 mph they would definitely not make a giant car and if you sit there and watch over millions of years it will still be the same mess. Checkmate atheists. Also I would like to ask a question atheists/agnostics out there. If I showed you a book. You would say hey a book! Everyone knows what a book is. Can a book write itself? No it needs an author. Our dna üß¨ is exactly a book in cell form. So who created dna? A living creator with intelligence beyond what we can ever imagine. So every atheist out there is living a lie and some actually are deceived and are looking for something physical to see but others are just ignorant people who hate God and looking for excuses to live their own life based on what they see as right. Kind of like satans lie to eve isn‚Äôt it?  Satan said you will be like Gods if you eat this forbidden fruit you will be able to say what is right and what is wrong but she was deceived. Don‚Äôt be ignorant on purpose. God loves you atheists and he loves you just as much as his children. He‚Äôs holding back the judgements with one hand and is telling you to come home with the other. But one day both his hands will drop. Repent and follow Jesus. Also how come science can‚Äôt explain certain things but the Bible can. When California made history with the LGBTQU community God set California ablaze with unquenchable fire. No coincidence because whenever something sinful happens a judgement comes. God hates the stench of sin. When you die you will go heaven or hell and the choice is up to you. God doesn‚Äôt obligate anyone to be his child, but even if you don‚Äôt choose Holy God you choose the devil. The devil has a lot of people blinded with a veil of foolishness.
