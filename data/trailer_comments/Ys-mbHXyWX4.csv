2014-04-27T15:56:20,"(Economic security or insurance) Often I post comments or articles about the US National Debt or the possible fail of the US dollar. I like so many people in life, work and these problems in life and history I simply have no personal effect or influence. Therefore, I wake up today, the sun shines and I am thankful for a new day and go about my daily chores. What can an individual do with a problem so large as the national debt and the US economy?   We the US people have clearly written in our history of an economy, the US dollar being support or backed by gold or silver. History clearly shows by being on the standard over all the value of gold stayed the same and so did the inflation rate for the country. For over 100 plus years, we only had 3% inflation total.   There are two original sin characteristics in play. One is the liar or the devil; define it as un-back dollars given by the Federal Reserve Bank and World Bank and its secret owners at inflation-hidden tax to the people without representation, always being told (lied to) this will fix our problems. And easy example to see this lie is if you imagine taking your own credit card max out and then paying it with another credit card, repeating the process living the good life and telling yourself all is well, delaying the responsibility of debt to an fantasy untold future.    The second sin is the original sin of people since the beginning of time and this called, ‘want, desire, greed’ as we as a people chose the tree of knowledge and ignored the rule of absolute authority our God. As a people, we ignored our own self-disciplines for self-gratification.   During the 1900s, we had an economic collapse of the stock market and in desperate need by our politicians and a desire to take care of the people.  In a moment of political weakness politicians rather than follow self-disciplines of our economic society or the finite limitations of gold as a limiting factor, we fell to greed with a lie of fantasy of economic salvation a remote credit trap of debt slavery.   Once the debt exceeds you ability with your income to pay it the only solution to continue the fantasy is to raise the debt level and continue to spend. Eventually with compounded interest towards this debt, the rate of debt grows faster and faster, destroying any assets the public has saved.   Our founders of the US Constitution left Europe of this type of debt and hated the idea of government money to issue from Banks. The founders recognized the limitation, corruptibility of each human with ‘want, desire and greed’. Therefore, one person cannot create laws, rather by elected democratic processes with public clarity by having freedom of the press.   Here we are with a fiat currency system of every increasing currency and debt with the bank and corporation owners of our currency also the owners of our media clouding and hiding the truth from the public and politicians. This current system by all real application corrupted for the benefit of greed with the use of lies by the banks and corporation with a political system to weak to tell the moneychangers or the people NO to debt and slaver, but to follow self-discipline.   The history books are filling with exactly and complete clarity of any country economic currency being fiat and back by nothing 100% of the time fails.   Germany is a highly intelligent was a well-rounded multi diverse people with many different religions living together. Because of fiat money, when it fell in history Hitler attempted to come to power and jailed for treason. Later he let out of jail and the country fell again too economically at this time Hitler by the people elected into power, because at this time the people were desperate.   During the 1900s with our economic depression our own country became desperate and then moved to a fiat economic system with a gentle secret voice to give the people social programs unaffordable and will lead to our economic inflationary national debt ruin. A perfect example is to look to country Argentina was number one in the world economically at the time the US was number one. With its fiat currency and overly burdensome social programs, the country is bankrupt with extreme inflation.   Examples of economic chaos or collapse, corruptibility can be seen currently and with history all around the world from effects of a fiat system; money from nothing.   Gold what good is it; I cannot eat it. Gold is useful as money simple because of its rarity for value, it does not expire and the amount of it in the world is finite.  If you equal gold to self-discipline of government and its currency, suddenly you receive stability in law and stability in value of goods and work. This is why gold for 6000 years been use as money.   Intelligent countries around the world recognize the warning sign of a fiat currency. They have largely for years stockpile large amounts of gold. The largest of these countries is China, Russia and India, and there are others.  While you might not agree with the politics of these countries, it easily seen as a country they are intelligent.   Our fiat currency will fail with it said by many economic experts between now and the year 2020. Our great depression prior in history lasted over 10 years from the 1920s. I pray during our desperate hour of economic chaos our country does not fall in desperation to new government run by Hitler, Crazy Tyrant, Kings, or Banker Kings, socialism, communism, etc.  I pray the people will look to our history and see clearly we do have a written US Constitution that work for the people and was economically gold self-disciplined.   In all of history during any countries economic chaos, those who held gold and silver profited and did well. It said by the year 2020 gold could be worth $50,000 per one ounce. If a person bought one or two ounces, during an economic depression a person could use this value to pay off their own bills, pay college or go to college and adapt to a changing world.  Note silver follows up or down with the value of gold and is very affordable too.    What can a person do when the government is Trillions of dollars in debt; buy Gold Eagle one-ounce coins or buy Silver Eagle one-ounce coins and remember our history – the old US Constitution before 1871- of a system that did work for the people.  God Bless America!    I am always against violence and wish to government transition to be a calm political process of change.",0,0,Jeff Lee,Ys-mbHXyWX4,0.10818362193362194,2014-04-27 15:56:20,True,True

2014-07-03T17:11:57,"I think people are overrating how groundbreaking this is. Is it a cool concept? Sure...but groundbreaking? I'm sure many film directors would preferably love it if they could use a time machine for films that have time gaps but its inconvenient.

I can't help but fell that this is an opportunity missed... a far better product would present the boy's unique struggles because although boyhood is a universal experience, it is uniquely experienced by the individual (the boy).

Critics always say the reason we get such formulaic junk and sequels is that people don't want to see quality original movies like the Tom Cruise movie Edge of Tomorrow. That bombed because people are tired of him. Make a quality movie and people will go. This movie cost around two million to make and looks like it is going to be a big hit. You don't have to spend 150 million dollars to make a movie that people want to see. People are willing to invest THREE hours to watch this!

2014-08-05T10:06:26,"Okay I may be in the vast minority in this one but I feel Boyhood is tremendously overrated. It's not, by any means, a bad film, just not nearly as good as most critics claim it is. The problem I have with this film is its glaring lack of substance. There is not a single character in this film that goes through some kind of character arc. The minor changes they undergo are left obscure and there are no hints as to what brought about those changes. None of the characters are likable. The entire film almost is a passive observation of this family's uneventful progression through the years. Although that worked very well in the first half of the movie the second half seemed superfluous. It brings back some of the most overused cliches (honestly if I had a nickel for every time a movie showed the divorced dad as cool and buff and the divorced mother as the complete opposite). The kid actors are great but as they age they seem less and less convincing. The dialogue as well suffers from cranky and mawkish moments. And on top of all that it lacks lacks a narrative structure. If you look at the Tree of Life, which is just as unstructured, Malick took advantage of that and turned it into a meditation on human behavior. Boyhood didn't even attempt to achieve anything of the sort. Tree of Life was poetry; Boyhood is just product. All the reviews I've read so far seem to be obsessed with the concept of the film rather than the final result. To me, Boyhood is yet another film that didn't come close to justifying its overblown hype. I would've given it a max of 7/10.",25,9,Appolo Bozec,Ys-mbHXyWX4,0.10613275613275613,2014-08-05 10:06:26,False,True

2014-08-23T21:44:17,"The only reason some people are skeptical about the movie or didn't like it as much is because of the reviews it got. I can bet that if you didn't even look at the reviews before you saw the movie, you'd appreciate it more. You can't really watch a movie like this and have any standards for it because it's never been done before. You guys probably went into the movie expecting some huge production with all these moments that'd be extra special but that's not what the movie was trying to go for. I can't really explain what the movie IS. It's just one of those movies where it doesn't need a hugely dramatic plot. Let me remind you that the movie was thought up in 2002, so if you see any themes that may have been in movies that came out since '02, obviously you're going to get some kind of cliche. It's expected, this movie was thought of in the early 2000s. Some people just didn't think about certain things before watching it, that's all. I loved the movie and I recommend it to anyone who can understand that this took 12 years to make and didn't get to start over from the beginning to modernize anything.

While I believe that the twelve year shoot was undeniably inventive and nostalgic, the film as a whole, and as a vehicle of plot, lacks a massive amount of impact. It feels like a senseless jumble of scenes from different years reassembled into an inorganic mass that begs to be coherent but lacks substance. The only factors that stand out are the directing and acting (Patricia delivered what can be called a good performance, but even the performances here are nothing that I would call Oscar-worthy). It seems to me that the span of filming is what has dragged critics to hail this film. I am not hating on it, but there are many other truly artful films this year with original premises that should be taken to consideration instead of this. Not forgetting performances by lead actresses that will be snubbed (I feel a stab of pain for Essie Davis and her masterful work in The Babadook). Those are my thoughts on the film. And it is with complete humbleness that I express my sadness towards the Academy and its injustices.  I hope others feel the same way too.

When they moved to San marcos i was so blown away by how much it related to me, since that's where i live now for college, and they literally filmed a scene down a street where I walk on everyday. The music they show in the movie is so on point in that time period. I am the same age as Mason, and went away to college this year and it got me in my feels so quick because I realize now how fast life is going by and all i have now are happy memories.

With Boyhood he's done the same kind of thing but in one film filmed over a period of 12 years and it really works well. Linklater shows that you don't need bangs or crashes , CGI or ridiculous plots to make a good film . You just need to be a good story teller. I expect this to pick up many awards in the next month or two , simply because this kind of film making is quite rare and at 2 hours 45 minutes it might test some peoples patience but because i have two boys growing up and i'm already a fan of the director, i really liked it.  8 out of 10 ",0,0,redvalleyjohn,Ys-mbHXyWX4,0.33589743589743587,2015-01-15 12:29:10,False,False

It has no wow factor like top action movies, no super fun factor like comedy movies, no brain-hurt factor like Christopher Nolan's movies. It's not even original of its kind, just telling an ordinary American family's story.

It's fine if you don't like it, but if you hate it because you think it's boring, pointless or whatever, I can say that you have a really cheap taste of movies. Only lame people with no life experience want conflict in such a movies about life story. When you're old enough to look back at your life, maybe you'll realize that your life has been even more boring as fuck than what you think about this film.

Seems to me like a lot of people didn't enjoy it all... And I don't know why? Maybe it was too focused on American life? I think this is a movie that you should watch alone at night and try to stay focused. This movie is also remarkably unique in its production. I guess Hollywood knows that the general audience doesn't want long and thought out but short and intense (All these superhero movies). I like both types I guess.

Some ""moments"" in our lives, the ones we love and cherish, may be awkward, they may be slow, they may be dull, they may be boring. But through it all, these moments add on to all of the fun, passionate, and wonderfully different memories that we love and cherish.

The problem is this movie shows a indeed superb mom and 3 Dads that either were assholes, or turn into assholes, without even giving us a hint why.

Gostei bastante. Comecei pesquisar mais sobre o sobre a produção do filme e o diretor Richard Linklater não queria usar maquiagem para envelhecer os atores ou mesmo trocá-los durante a filmagem, por isso, ele manteve o mesmo elenco e gravou o filme durante 12 anos. Eu estava assistindo o filme por partes, assisti uns 30 minutos ai depois mais um pouco e tal, quando eu comecei a perceber e os atores estavam envelhecendo e eram as mesmas pessoas, resolvi pesquisar, mais sobre o filme. Estou assistindo agora pela segunda vez com mais atenção, pois não acompanhei direito na primeira vez, gostei da história..👍👍👍👍 Como tudo na vida, tem gente que não vai gostar, mas acredito que a maioria vai curtir demais a evolução e o crescimento do Ellar Coltrane Kinney Salmon.
