Why would a angel need wings, why would ghosts need clothes for, can't Satan read because if he can then he should know all of gods moves becoz his fate is written in the bible. As a matter of fact God should be able to destroy the devil with a mere thought, and if god is all knowing what's the purpose of man living his life if god knows the outcome to all things. God already know who's gonna sin and who isn't. It's not that atheistS don't believe in god, they just don't believe in the ridiculousness of the stories in the bible.

But God takes holiness seriously. He is not a hater waiting to destroy all who have sinned. But sin has to be dealt with nonetheless. That's why He had to send His son Jesus to die. For Jesus offered his pure life as a sacrifice for the sin we've all partaken in. But because He takes holiness seriously, He can't allow anyone into heaven, only those who have accepted that Jesus is the only way in. Only because of what He did in life and death and resurrection. So God IS holy and can't tolerate sin, He is Love and offered a way of forgiveness made possible by His son, and God IS just, he can't allow evil off the hook. Illustration: take the person you love most. Your dad, mom, brother, friend, wife/husband, etc...lets say (your wife or mom) was raped and beat to death and the police caught the guy that did it. In court after he was found guilty, he says, I never done anything wrong until this act. My good life should make up for this one bad deed. Now you would be livid if the judge let him off the hook. You'd prolly want to go kill him yourself. But God can't let that off the hook just like you wouldnt want that man to go free unpunished. So yes, Hell, the eternal punishment for everyone is real. But Jesus, when He died, visited Hell for us and took our pain on himself before rising again. Those that acknowledge and honor Jesus death for us with their lives here won't have to pay the penalty. But if you think you don't need forgiveness or a savior, then I hope your right. But dont let hypocritical Christians keep you from heaven. Don't risk your eternity on misled religious failures.

I come across atheists who are hateful and judgemental and say 'nasty' and vulgar language towards Christians all the time. But would it be safe for me to say ALL atheists are like that? No. if you don't want to believe in God, go ahead, you have the right to freely choose to not believe. But isn't it strange how their are certain people out there who don't believe in God and yet insist on trying to remove 'God' or 'Christ' from everything, remove public prayer in schools, the 10 Commandments from the Supreme Court, etc? How does that let Christians freely believe what we want to believe in. I don't believe in unicorns or ghosts but you don't see me trying to remove everything related to it. I don't celebrate Jewish holidays but it doesn't mean I'm going to fight to get them removed from the calendar. Christianity is not a religion and is not just a list of rules and 'do-nots' or you'll go to hell. All those laws in the Old Testament (can't shave your beard, eat pork, wear cotton/polyester blend clothing, etc) are under the Jewish Law of the Old Covenant. The Pharisees upholding the law while Christ was alive got so caught up in the 'religion' sense that even Christ himself referred to them as snakes and hypocrites, because they would add their own laws, punish those who broke them and yet broke them themselves. That's why Christians are told to obey the 10 Commandments and also the teachings of Christ, and one of the most important teachings is to Love God and love others. God loves us all equally and sees all sin as the same which is precisely why NO ONE should judge others and think we are better than anyone else. But this should go BOTH ways. Christians shouldn't judge atheists for their actions or beliefs, and atheists should do the same. And if everyone focused on that instead of all the rules, rituals, traditions of religions then we would all get along much better",0,0,pchotsauce,Hn_bRrxIGY8,0.08198529411764706,2013-12-04 18:23:30,True,True

Lanza, instead, said that when we die our life becomes a 'perennial flower that returns to bloom in the multiverse.' He continued: 'Life is an adventure that transcends our ordinary linear way of thinking. When we die, we do so not in the random billiard-ball-matrix but in the inescapable-life-matrix.' Lanza cited the famous double-slit experiment to backup his claims.   In the experiment, when scientists watch a particle pass through two slits in a barrier, the particle behaves like a bullet and goes through one slit or the other.  Yet if a person doesn't watch the particle, it acts like a wave, This means it can go through both slits at the same time. This demonstrates that matter and energy can display characteristics of both waves and particles, and that behaviour of the particle changes based on a person's perception and consciousness.",0,0,CmPunkBeast,Hn_bRrxIGY8,-0.025000000000000005,2013-12-09 22:36:33,True,True

Remember Matt 22:14 ""Many are invited but few are chosen"".  1 Corinthians 1:18 (NIV) 18For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.” 21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.  Dear Lord Jesus May you touch the hearts of those that don't see or understand you yet. May you draw them to your absolute TRUTH that has been revealed to those who believe. May we see them through your eyes and have patience with their ignorance since they do not know better. I know that the time is coming when we all will die and will meet you to either rejoice in your presence or be sentenced to be away from your forever. May you bless the hearts of those who are trying to bring your light and truth to the world. In Jesus mighty name I pray Amen!

Science is 1 of 2 all encompassing branches of knowledge. Science is about weighing evidence. But equally as substantive and even mind-blowing in this debate is the 2nd branch of knowledge: art. How does art refute the existence of god? Beliefs are like fingerprints, no two are alike. The meaning of life for you can be whatever you choose to perceive it to be. One answer does not fit all. We are too evolutionarily diverse. You can pretend the boogie man created you, and it doesn't matter, you will still die one day. All you have is the now. Your life was once a blank slate, an empty canvas, but you let it get filled up with the subjective culture around you. You did not create your own approach, or remain open minded, you became one of the mindless masses, buying into whatever the nearest person was selling. In this case it was American pie and Christianity, both only malleable, shapeable, changing ideas. Each of us with our own unique quirks and irrationalities, with only a rare glimmer of objectivity, open-mindedness and the will to improve and redefine the world around us.

2014-03-25T23:06:42,I read this book and wasn't amazed at all that a Christian family asked him stupid bible questions. They couldn't think outside the box and ask him what people did for fun or what everything looked like. And most of the story has nothing to do with the boy's story about heaven but rather the life of the family. That's not why I picked this book up is to hear some pastor in disbelief and their boring ass life. I wanted to know about heaven. And the kid only explained a thing or two and everything else is biblical. Besides... none of us know what God or heaven TRULY is until we get there and STAY there. I had a near death experience too when I was 10. It was just the most overwhelming love that I can't explain in human words. But I never saw Jesus or even people for that matter. I just saw an luminous white light at the end of the tunnel. And I knew it was God. You just know. But Jesus and all that?? Plus Hollywood will NEVER achieve special effects even remotely close to what heaven REALLY looks like. That's just straight fact. Heaven is beyond our human comprehension just like God is.,0,0,Travis Shallcross,Hn_bRrxIGY8,0.08721804511278194,2014-03-25 23:06:42,True,True
