The reality is the police get the right person over 99.999% of the time, people that are innocent are few and far between and most of the cases of people being released decades after they were arrested and convicted is due to the prosecutors being unable to proceed to trial again on the person because most of the witnesses and/or evidence is unavailable for a new trial (and not because the person was actually innocent).  I'm not saying mistakes aren't made, but they are are far more the exception than the rule.  Not to mention the extensive number of people that are actually guilty, but their cases are dismissed on technicalities, pretrial issues that arise, or juries that find people not guilty because they watch too much TV and don't know what a trial and evidence are supposed to look like anymore.
