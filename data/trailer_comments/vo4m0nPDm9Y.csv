I don’t think Tom is a ghost or angel but I do think he may be related to the heart transplant,1,0,Courtney,vo4m0nPDm9Y,0.2785714285714286,2019-09-30 14:52:45,True,True

In the decidedly pre-woke year 1985 Grundy Television cast Czechoslovakian actress Dasha Bláhová as half-Czech and half-Italian wife and mother Maria Ramsay in cheapo Australian soap Neighbours. In the enlightened year 2019 smug luvvie Emma Thompson cast herself as a Croatian mother cowering in fear in front of the news on TV in trash festive romcom Last Christmas, a movie she also co-wrote and co-produced. Apparently she gets some virtue signalling in to the script about Brexit and the impact on race relations... but her own ego-driven addiction to self promotion demanded she gave us her own cringey ‘comedy foreigner in a British sitcom’ routine, rather than casting an actress who could more authentically portray the immigrant experience that she seemingly wants to ‘shine a light on’ as Hollywood folk like to put it. Talk about having your Brexit cake and eating it.  Before anyone replies “you sound angry.” Not really, I’ve just never cared for Emma Thompson.
