Enjoy the movie with the female lead just as equally with a male lead like Rogue one. The new Star Wars movie is shit. The director is saying I don't need white men and her movie shows the stupidity of that statement. Solo didn't do as well as it should have.

2018-06-08T17:56:19,"I don't understand why people are so absolutely butthurt seeing a movie where a female protagonist goes around saving abuse victims, saying it's ""SJW - The movie""   Is it really going that far into that territory to say that? No one said that about John Wick and he...wait for it...killed a bunch of people because they killed his dog. (not really related but come on lmao). We've seen so many different vigilante stories/heros, you cannot possibly be surprised that someone has made one with this content. It isn't like she's beating up men who catcall, or misogynist bosses. That, yes, would be fair enough to make fun of to an extent. But tasing a dude who beat the shit out of his wife and cheated on her with another man's wife(yes, the other man matters too in the morality of the situation, sorry this is so long I'll get to my point lol) is.... not bad? At least, not in the sense of what most people seem to think of it to be, as if she is simply a whiny social justice warrior. He's done quite a terrible thing, which would have gone unnoticed, so she is doing something about it. Which.. AHEM. Is like ALL vigilante stories/characters out there.  Sorry for the rant, I just wanted to make it perfectly clear, and wanted to share my opinion. And, hopefully, give people a better idea of what this movie is really about.  Aside from that, it's sad to see that a movie, which appears to honestly have a good, intriguing plot and interesting premise is being shit on because people are too sensitive about he subject matter. From a truly critical standpoint, this does look like a really good movie. Well written, good actors, cinematography is *pop* noice. Would love to see it. If any of you would like to discuss more about this movie/my opinion on it critically, I'd love to hear it. If you have nothing.. mature.. to say, eh, please just don't waste your time on it.   P.S. - She also has beef with an actual woman. 1) This brings in more plot. 2) This gives this character more substance other than the perceived ""feminist sjw"".",5,6,Ci De Jong,4JshbIplBkc,0.14523809523809522,2018-06-08 17:56:19,True,True

Those against this movie see it in a general sense. They see a woman dedicated to beating up men, because for some reason it makes it seem that all men what to do in their free time is beat up their wives. The other side see it more specifically, they recognize the character and understand that this is her thing.   Personally I sympathize more with those against it, simply cause I have not read the series and it really makes me feel like some truly believe all men are just violent morons.
