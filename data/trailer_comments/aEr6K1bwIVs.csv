2015-07-02T08:39:41,"Fun Fact about Steve Jobs. This is a FACT that very few people know, not even those involved in making this movie any other movie or likely those that have written about Steve.  Maybe it's time to set the record straight.....Most of you know that Steve Jobs passed away while fighting cancer, but first a few things of note.....did he die because the cancer consumed him? Possibly, more likely it was because he had a liver transplant while he still had metastatic cancer in his body. Usually this is a big no no partly due to the fact that a liver transplant or any transplant requires immune suppressing anti-rejection drugs. If you have cancer cells active in your body there is very little to stop them after a transplant. But who knows for sure, but this is the most likely scenario based on the facts. What kind of cancer did he have....? Pancreatic, Liver ? NO, Steve Jobs was a PNet...a what? Pnet is an acronym for pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer....hmmm so he had pancreatic cancer then? NO not quite, he  had neuroendocrine cancer with a primary tumor in his pancreas and metastasis to his liver and likely other locations too. This is a completely different kind of cancer than the pancreatic cancer that killed Patrick Swayze within a year or 2. Nets patients commonly live years and even decades continually battling tumors as they slowly spread through out their bodies. This is why Steve had at least ten years and perhaps could have lived longer with better treatment choices. He did one thing right when he went to Basal Switzerland for PRRT treatment.For most patients this stabilizes the disease for several years. It is not yet available in the USA  except as a clinical trial here and there. So not yet FDA approved, however it is the gold standard of treatment for this disease in just about every country on the planet for the last 15 years or more. So here's the thing...many NETS patients (also known as Carcinoid cancer) suffer a complicated set of symptoms that are collectively known as Carcinoid syndrome. I won't go into all the details as they are different inmany patients. One of those set of symptoms is a little doosey that is known as CARCINOID RAGE ....GRrrr !!! Not often talked about in the community by patients or doctors probably due to associated stigma. It is a very  specific set of psychotic symptoms that are best described by well, Steve Jobs could have been the ideal poster boy let's say. Everything you have noted (correctly) are due to the specific actions of certain hormones, peptides, serotonin being released upon the brain and body.  Studies have shown marriages and relationships being broken, jobs lost, careers ruined among many other horrible outcomes. The average time to a correct diagnosis with this disease (after presenting with symptoms) is 7-10 YEARS ! Many people have had it for decades perhaps as far back as childhood undiagnosed. It's a slow slow cancer most of the time. Some studies have demonstrated that a diagnosis could be made years earlier based on the patients mental health.   In other words in case some of you have missed the point....Steve Jobs demonstrated the symptoms of his disease for many years and continued to get worse just as the disease got worse. Why do I know this? Because my wife has this disease. She was diagnosed over 4 years ago. However I'd say at least 7 or 8 years prior to that i noticed her behavior changing, her anger just totally absurd, off the wall tantrums for no reason blaming others for nothing in a fit of massive range. So bad was it that 2 years prior to her diagnosis I was researching online, printed some articles on carcinoid RAGE and cancer, filed it away and discovered those papers a year after her diagnosis....I had been on the right track just didn't realize at the time. So people now you know the true reason for Steve Jobs's outrageous behavior and why it was displayed and got worse for years. Could he have taken drugs for that to control it ?  Maybe there's not much help in that area of the disease especially since it is rare, they are focusing on the disease itself rather than all the other aspects. However many patients take a long acting monthly shot of a synthetic hormone known as Octreotide or Sandostatin Lar. This helps control many of the disease symptoms especially the physical such as facial/chest flushing, severe diarrhea, heart disease and to some extent the 'noid rages as we call them. There is a lot to this little known but most virulent of all cancers it strikes many and in many parts of the body and lays hidden confounding doctors for many years.  So every body cut Steve a little slack, in a sense he was mentally ill (stigma) but yet still changed all of our worlds forever. I for one am grateful, even though I am a die-hard Android fan !  This is likely the first time that what I have revealed regarding Steve Jobs is now publicly available. To Steve's family....I apologize,  but the world has a right to know and there are many others suffering whom might benefit from greater awareness of this disease and its effects. I think honestly Steve would agree.",1,0,Gary Bate,aEr6K1bwIVs,0.04752803237913077,2015-07-02 08:39:41,True,True

I think that it is coming across nicely.  Sure, wouldn't I would love to see this film done by Fincher and led by Bale would have been absolutely perfect as Jobs? Sure I would, but I must say seeing this in the hands of someone like Danny Boyle and being led by Michael Fassbender is going to be a true win/win. What was Fincher and Bale's loss will be Boyle and Fassbender's gain.  I think that more and more Michael Fassbender is becoming a true A-lister leading man in everything that he does. He is getting better and better. He is going to totally crush this movie. I would not be surprised if he carries this movie all the way to Oscar season and to get it nominated. He is a very intelligent and versatile actor and he may not look like Jobs but he is like clay in the hands of Boyle and he has allowed himself to be molded into him.  But I am also impressed with the supporting cast around him. From Seth Rogan, to Jeff Daniels, to what I think is an almost invisibly and totally invested into her role, Kate Winslet who has gotten so much better the older she gets much like Tom Hanks has evolved. I can see her easily get another Oscar on her mantle.  Overall, I could see this film become what Birdman did last year. I think that as Danny Boyle has brought an energy and life to this film I think that he also brings a sense and has made it almost made this movie feel visceral and tangibly alive before our very eyes.

Keep in mind, Michael Fassbender might be one of the greatest actors working right now in full honesty, and people are actually DEFENDING Ashton Kutcher, who turned in a cheesy-at-best performance whose only redeeming quality was that he LOOKED like Steve Jobs. It shouldn't matter if Fassbender looks like Jobs; as long as he can embody who he was and turn in a compelling performance that suits the story, there's no reason to criticize him.  Also, when did it matter whether or not the actor looked like who they were playing? Look at a movie like ""I'm Not There,"" where they got 6 different actors (including a woman) to play embodiments of Bob Dylan. Or even recently with ""Love and Mercy,"" neither Paul Dano nor John Cusack look at all like Brian Wilson. However, in both cases, those movies were fantastic and all the actors were compelling and did a terrific job regardless, because they at least captured the soul of who those people were, and suspended the disbelief.

He shepherded the company and a huge community of users and developers through a transition from 680x0 processors running Pascal, C, and C++ to G3/G4/G5 processors with a whole new Unix-based OS based on a weird C dialect, and finally to Intel and ARM processors running Swift, keeping apps like Photoshop and MS Office running on Macs throughout.

Also, the director and crew know what they're doing when they're making a movie, okay? They knew what they were doing when they decided to choose Michael Fassbender as their Steve Jobs. Michael is a ridiculously talented actor so I know he will be absolutely amazing in this movie. Stop complaining and simply enjoy the trailer. We get it, some of you want Ashton Kutcher at Steve Jobs, but build a bridge and get over it. Accept the fact that they chose Michael and try to enjoy the trailer. We get your concern over who looks more like who, but the film has already been made.

Much like Eisenberg looked and sounded nothing like Mark Zuckerberg he projected Zuckerberg's egotistical dominant persona that was perfect for the film. Here it seems Fassbender is reflecting Jobs' voice, mannerisms but most of all Sorkin's evident depiction of a character believing himself to be superior to others. Ironically similar to Zuckerberg. It's not about straight imitation when giving a performance but dissection making a character's motivation visible to the audience.

If you read that book about Steve Jobs (I forgot the author's name) you already knew that Jobs was a genius and an asshole.  The asshole part was very very obvious from this Documentary.  It's more of a statement about US than him.   Why do WE idolize assholes?  Yes Jobs made amazing products but still…..he was dishonest (criminally at times), arrogant, treated most people like shit, was a bully and had very little empathy for people.    But here's the thing.  ALL geniuses have certain things in common.  They have vision, creativity, charisma and are goal-driven.  They are perfectionists.  Really they are all so similar.  This all reminds me of Michael Jackson.  He had all the same qualities except he was NOT an asshole.  Actually the opposite.  I don't think there has ever been a genius who was also an amazingly kind, caring and humble human being.  And a great humanitarian.  My question is why aren't we celebrating him?  And why wasn't his name included in this Jobs Documentary with other ""geniuses"" and iconic people?  Lennon's name was in there.  Lady Diana's name was in there.  Michael Jackson changed the world of music forever and brought enormous joy to millions of people the world over.  He spent his life giving back (in terms of time and money) to help the less fortunate of the world.  He was the most famous man in the world and there will NEVER be another Michael Jackson.

The West Wing and The Newsroom  are two of my favourite TV shows of all time and all I can say than god Sorkin was involved with this film because otherwise it could have been a disaster. This is not a biography of Steve Jobs more a character assassination of the man.  It revolves around four product launches and the arguments he has at the time with nearly everyone around him.  It feels like a redemption movie but Steve Jobs wasn't that bad as to make the point. He was a businessman and acted like most successful driven people do.  The stand out performance is from Seth Rogan ( you won't here me say that too often!) who plays Steve Wozniak . I only wish Rogan would play straight roles more often, Overall this is watchable for the fast flowing , Sorkin Dialogue , but other than that , because of the strange format , it's quite forgettable.",0,0,redvalleyjohn,aEr6K1bwIVs,0.14732142857142863,2015-12-29 11:40:53,False,True

2016-07-19T22:37:55,"I think this movie is about how you can feel  one way about a computer, or a car, or a work  of art, and quite another way, concerning the  person who made it.  The creator and his creation  are not the same, are they?  And neither should  the message be confused with the messenger,   because he did not author that message, did he?   ""You're the only one in the world who cares that  it should be housed in a perfect cube"".  Yet, in the  person of Jesus Christ, it could be said that the  Messenger IS the Message, for He is the Word  made flesh.  And his Father, the Author.  Today, I  was at a grocery store, paying for a carton of eggs  and some cream, and as the cashier handed me the  change, some coin fell out of my hand and rolled into   a ""help feed hungry children"" donation box.  And I  thought upon how different actions are from intent.   Jesus said that He always does His Father's Will.   Yet, in the Garden of Gethsemene, he prayed, while  his sweat fell from his head as great drops of blood,  and he prayed : ""May this cup of suffering pass from  me, but not MY WILL, Father, but yours be done.""   Personally, I do not trust charitable organizations  and they who run them.  Yet, I made, it would seem,  a donation today.  ""He means what he says, and he  says what he means"".  Know anybody, that honest?   Such that others do not ask, What did he mean?   But, what does THAT mean?  The world?     ""Eh little buddy..""  Sarcasm?

When actors speak Sorkinese they seem so coherent and heaps intelligent. Fassbender is my fav. It's coincidence that Jobs named the cube 'Next' and Gen Next (after X) would be the first Gen to grow up using its OS - a Mac that looked like 'Judy Jestson's  bake oven, for 'a Generation that would be the first to have the advantages of Jetson like technology'. Almost as freakish as Jobs meeting Arthur C Clark as a young boy; freakish that it is documented footage.  Although baby Jobs doesn’t look all that  interested as Clark (with weird exactitude) talks about a future the young boy will orchestrate into being. Not so freakish that Clark (a futurist) would hold such a vision of the future after all his imagination gave birth to Hal -an artificial intelligent PA with a natural language interphase.

A FILM. it is not a big fanboy made film for Apple nerds to geek out about to sell a new iPhone or to boost Steve Jobs' legacy to an 11.  You want to know the reason why this film was made? Probably because Jobs (2013) was a critical and commercial failure and I'd much rather see that film get remade and get proper filmmaking behind it or we could get endless Friday the 13th reboots. You can say he looks nothing like Steve Jobs. Fair. But do you want Ashton Kutcher to play Jobs, get hired because he looks like him, thank you makeup, and get a nomination at the Razzies or Fassbender get hired because of his acting ablilities and get a nomination at the Oscars?   Matt Whitely. Do you know who Matt Whitely is? Of course you don't. He only has one credit on IMDb and that's for writing Jobs. They took someone who had no experience in anything. No commercials, short films, not even writing anything. When I first searched up Matt Whitely on Yahoo Search, the first answer I got were profiles on Facebook. If I look up Danny Boyle or Aaron Sorkin, at least I get a sidebar to the right showing their pictures and occupations. That's who we got. Now would you rather have them or someone who could have been cleaning up popcorn off theater floors for all we know?  They didn't make this film for a cash grab. They had it in production before the 2013 film came out or was even in production. Now it's getting hate because apparently it didn't come out fast enough to compete with the first one. It was made because we wanted a well made film of this and we got one.  I could ramble forever about Steve jobs himself and the backlash against him and his character. It doesn't paint him as a man who has done nothing wrong. It paints him as a man who did put quality before other people in his life and himself and it did it with grace and dignity. It knows what to say and that's the fact that no one knew how to feel about him, his morals, his ethics. It shows you and lets you decide.
