2018-09-19T16:53:03,"This wasn't as bad as everyone is making it out to be. After the first initial scenes I was expecting for Jennifer Garner's character, Riley , to do some type of vigilante justice boot type camp of training , but there wasn't any . This was an indication that this movie was going straight to being all about the action, and it was. The only problem with these type of movie structures is that there isn't as much time for character development. Thus I don't hate a character as much as I should , or learn to love one either. That's ok, for the main focus here is to introduce you to Peppermint, and they achieved that with high kicks. I like how they used certain points to lead you to the next point . One, the ice pick . Two, the Riley's gun being to close Three, the reintroduction to the ice pick again. One, you new something,  Two, a uneasy tense in us the viewer . Three, damn it, that ice pick that I forgot about.  Those set ups are nicely done here. Yes, there was spots were you did say,  "" No , I wouldn't go near that dead body with a desk from above on it "" . unless I was out of ammo , "" And I certainly wouldn't roll him over "". Top guys don't do that in the first place. Happily though those iffy's weren't that much and it didn't bother me that much either. Near the end of the movie there was a point were I thought ,  "" Does this movie really want me to believe me that this crime boss is that arrogant and stupid "". and that lead me to think that the director must think that I hate this crime boss at this point, but I didn't .  Maybe that's because Juan Pablo Raba's role didn't have time to make me feel this way. Maybe it's because it was that he wasn't as convincing as he was in Shot Caller. Not sure. They did have someone say that they had to leave before the police show up. Sometimes those types of plot explanations are done cheaply. That really wasn't the case here to much. I did love how incredible Jenifer looked in this movie though. She was *_Bad Ass Buff Beautiful_* .  She made the unbelievable , believable.  There are  more and more strong female characters roles coming out ,  and there is an audience  for them. Trust me. I saw I number of women walking out of the movie theater, strutting like they were about to go out  and kick some ass. Ronda Rousey was in Mile 22 and she was good. Completely surprised. The ending was great. Nice little twist.  The whole hand thing. So I do expect and hope to see more Jennifer in Peppermint . I saw this movie for $4.80 . I would watch it again . Not right away.

It's clear at this point we can't even have movie reviews anymore without critics letting their political bias get in the way. Now they even need to make sure their agendas are getting pushed in movies. If it's something that goes directly against their views it magically gets a bad rating and if it's something that supports their views EVEN IF it's a bad movie (cough ghost busters) it magically gets good ratings.
