2017-07-27T18:30:26,"First off, to the people complaining that their are jump scares in the TRAILER, let me just say that you haven't seen the  movie yet so you can't just assume they will be in the film as well.   Secondly, I will admit, this trailer had a lot of ""unnatural jump-scares,"" essentially, the noises accompanying the scares are from the musical score rather than an entity or object in the film's universe producing it's natural sound. The best use of a jump scare as of late was in Five Nights at Freddy's, where the sound came only from the animatronic voice box, which is something in the game's universe thus keeping the immersion in the game even with a rather cheap scare tactic. There is nothing wrong with a jump-scare if it is done naturally instead of mechanically.  However, I have a feeling that a lot of these jump-scare music tings have been purposefully inserted into the trailer to market the movie to more people as a way of getting them to see it. Ouija: Origin of Evil had it's trailers with some jump scares in them, but the movie itself contained none of the sort.    Finally, I am going to see this film no matter what. Whether their are cheap-o jump scares in the movie has, again, yet to be confirmed by anyone. If there are, I will pull no punches in bringing them up in a written review. For now, I suggest we all wait patiently till the movie's release.  Thank You.",60,3,AheadoftheCurb Ok,hAUTdjf9rko,0.05000000000000002,2017-07-27 18:30:26,True,True

2017-07-28T03:21:29,"God created everything perfect and made mankind in his image. Then Satan tempted Adam and Eve to disobey God and because of that disobedience they gave birth to the nature of sin and effected the world with sin. We all inherit sin from Adam and commit sin when we do something bad. Because of our sins we are destined for hell, will have eternal separation from a holy God and will continue to be spiritually dead. But God showed his great love for you by sending his son Jesus Christ to die on the cross to save you from your sins, so if you believe in him as your lord and savior, you will be destined for heaven, be saved and forgiven of your sins and will be given the Holy Spirit, who would make you spiritually alive. I experience the love and power of God though the Holy Spirit everyday and it's beyond human understanding:) Jesus rose from the dead and broke the power of death and Satan. Jesus is coming soon and will gather his faithful people into his kingdom, where there will be no more mourning, death, pain, sickness, depression, anger, or lost and there will be eternally great love, peace and joy that's beyond human understanding and beyond comparison. God will punish and judge those who don't have faith in Jesus because by not having faith they don't allow themselves to receive salvation. I did bad things, I lied, stole, looked at porn, did others terrible things and I still make mistakes but I started to read the Bible and the more I read it, the more my heart and life began to change for the better. Out of the great love, grace and mercy of God I'm saved from my sins and I'm grateful for everything God's done for me. God would never forsake or leave you no matter what and would always take care of you. God would help you in any area of your life and comfort you in times of need. Have you ever thought of what your purpose is? God would give you a purpose for this life and the life to come. This life is only temporary and goes by fast but the life to come is eternal. God loves you so much and that love he has for you is overwhelming and is like your the only person in all existence that he loves with all his heart. If you have questions about God or want me to pray for anything I'm always here for you. Also I have a video called God loves all:message, if your interested. God bless you and I hope you have a great, wonderful and fantastic rest of your year!:)",0,0,brandon caruso,hAUTdjf9rko,0.25405405405405407,2017-07-28 03:21:29,True,True

2017-09-17T21:31:07,"Saw this movie last night it was cool to see it remade from the 90's version.  It wasn't as scary as I was expecting it to be though.   In my opinion they didn't quite get the true character and look of 'IT' right when comparing it to the book.  I just didn't believe watching it that Pennywise the clown was really truly evil.    Sure the clown drools and does creepy movements, but it would have been scarier if the clown was even more elusive.  It should have been played by an older man not a young one, with a deep voice and more 1800ish clothing.  Somehow Tim Currey as IT in the 90's version still scares me more, not sure why.   I wanted to see IT being more demonic in nature, and being that I've come against and battled real demons the things most people don't even know exist, I can say it wasn't entirely accurate.  The kids in the movie kind of related to IT as if he was some scary serial killer, but it would have added to the psychological viewers affect if for example; they fainted or were paralyzed in fear when confronted by the clown which is what happens in real life when your in the presence of a real evil demonic being.   Pennywise should have been less hands on with the kids, until the finale scene in the sewers, because by that point they all met IT face to face already. If the kids saw Pennywise from a distance throughout the movie, and had the psychological mind tricks played on them until the finale in the sewers it would have added a level of mystery to the big confrontation. That way it adds  to the scary anticipation of facing IT.    Sometimes less is more, and admittedly the 1990's 'IT' movie still creeps me out more even though its more simplistic with no affects, maybe its just Tim Currey who naturally looks evil.",0,0,Elias,hAUTdjf9rko,0.03294723294723295,2017-09-17 21:31:07,False,True

2017-12-10T18:37:15,"WHO thought this sh*t up? I think it's MK ULTRA  because all of the kids see the same thing. Mass hallucination? I doubt it. I saw shadow people as a kid always following ,watching and hiding behind anything just as I was able to get a glimpse but I kept being told it was my imagination. NOW DECADES LATER other people are saying they see the same thing online. Evil Jinn? I don't think so. The so called Elite are constantly playing with some ..if not ALL of us with Psychotronic warfare. They have people going to psychologists probably just to push psyche drugs on you. They are using what we don't know against us and it's SAD. I never watched the It movies nor read the books. I didn't know that kids are being targeted.I bet in reality those kids were tricked into killing themselves with synthetic telepathy= ELF waves. Study it kids. It's pretty much just like Scooby Doo but you don't get to see the white d*vils behind it at the end. D*vils come in EVERY heritage so I'm not just picking on the white so called elites but it sure looks like they are behind it, along with every other race that joins their club as another honorary snake.
