The main character at the age of 70 decides to jump start her life after her mother's death by stalking a 30 year old hot man.  Her only claim to fame in the whole film is that she's present (spends most scenes just being there and clueless), likes her stalkee's funky music and dresses in mismatched colors like a homeless woman without the hygiene problem.  If Sally Field's character had been a man, he would have been considered creepy.  This film was more feminist propaganda aimed at the senior crowd, ""Don't worry ladies, your boobs are past your belly button, but still You Go Girl""  (Cue the Hot Actor Guy)  And this movie really makes you wonder just how abusive and crazy the main character's mother was.",0,0,rayme4raw,L6vBnnryIug,0.05462962962962962,2016-06-15 01:11:26,False,False
