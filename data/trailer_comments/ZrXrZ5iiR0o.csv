Rather its like a kind of message to us a humans as a whole to think about what our lives mean to us and what is meaningful. I am not convinced that memory is all we are  or that functioning is the most important thing. The poem shared by Lydia (Kirsten Stewart) which Alice picked up was about love was the highlight.
