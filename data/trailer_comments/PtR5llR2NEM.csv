2019-09-27T01:54:27,"...RE: to Sandler being called 'THE MOST UNDERRATED ACTOR OF ALL TIME'   How are you overlooking the slew of crap he's put his fans through in the last 15 years?  He truly had some 'gems' back in the day, but he really has not been selective about his roles at all.  He totally has talent at comedy, but not at picking parts.  Until I see this movie, Sandler does not suddenly get a free pass for picking movies with extremely subpar scripts and plots.  If Sandler genuinely cared and had a great passion for what he does it would show through great work.  Grown Ups and Jack & Jill were my breaking point :/ I hope he has some semblance of a rebound in terms of quality with this film :/ However, even that would be optimistic, cause sadly this story looks reeeally cliche and something we've already seen in movies like Robert De Niro's Mean Streets and Mark Wahlberg's The Gambler.  Honestly, I'm normally very optimistic, and for many years as a kid, Sandler was a huuuge deal for me.  But over the years his films have been huge let downs.  In films like the Wedding Singer, Sandler's character had a meaningful arc as we saw him get over a heartbreaking and truly relatable break-up, all the while having great jokes to punctuate it all.  In Grown Ups not only is there an unmemorable story, but forgettable one-liners and jokes as well that no one ever reminisces about.   I strongly want to see him have a comeback, and with the talent he's exhibited in the past, there isn't a problem on that end.  Most of the roles he takes, however, are safe, formulaic cash grabs, and rarely anything risky.  Hopefully this film doesn't bomb and Sandler branches out more.  Fingers crossed.   But anyway, the point is, when Sandler's once-in-a-lifetime talent remains dormant for so so long as a result of his poor role selections, especially for 15 years, he really does not deserve the esteem you so nonchalantly give him.  If anything his fans should show him they're not interested in the crappier films, and maybe this'll force his hand to choose parts that people will enjoy.  There's no point in settling for mediocrity - if his movies can even be called that.  It breaks my heart criticizing him so much, but frankly when no one says anything, Sandler will continue to make movies that don't live up to his former glory, and I find that the worse of the two evils.",0,0,DeathbySquirrelProductions,PtR5llR2NEM,0.10993163340724317,2019-09-27 01:54:27,True,True

2020-05-27T02:25:17,"The storyline seems like it was created by a paranoid schizophrenic. The writing seems to be done by a disorganized homeless man who's recently smoked copious amounts of  illegal substances. It feels as if it was written in a hasty attempt of disorganized chaos. I cannot fathom why it has such good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes but as in most things Rotten Tomatoes is about as accurate as a 12 gauge shotgun shot  by a drunk  baboon.  The dialogue seems as if it is an approximation of what the writers believe human interaction looks like. It is littered with fillers and time-wasting dialog meant to inform the viewer of something that we can understand perfectly fine ourselves by watching the actual film without needing to be filled in by an incompetent and  under-educated writing team.  The cinematography was lacking. I have seen YouTube videos with a higher understanding of how to film a video. The filming style feels hasty, disorganized and claustrophobic. Not helped by Adam Sandler's half-ass betrayal of a jeweler who for some reason is so self-obsessed he is unable to see it.  Although I do have to say this is one of Adam Sandler's better movies. Which isn't saying much.  All in all this was a disappointment. From the trailer it seems interesting but after watching for 5 minutes I quickly made up my mind this film is trash there's no other way to say it.",1,0,nicholas plamondon,PtR5llR2NEM,0.0505952380952381,2020-05-27 02:25:17,False,False
