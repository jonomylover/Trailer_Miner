But the more i thought about it i guess it’s smart advertising on them because it’s still building the hype. But at the same time they’re supposed to be revealing the actual doll on the child’s play website today so what was the point of not showing it on the teaser? But i would like for the people that automatically hate this just because you’re mad Dõn and brad aren’t apart of it. They chose not to do it and stick with their own brand so the other creator of child’s play went a different route and now we get to have child’s play back in the theater which y’all should be happy about! The cult of chucky was horrendous we need to be scared again and not laughing at chucky. I’m doing a full trailer break down and what i think is to come if interested on my channel signing out chuckys queen.

Because while he has the strength of an average adult male he still has the weight of a doll so you can chuck him around and stomp him pretty easily.

2019-02-08T23:37:30,A little worried about this. Seems like Chucky is now just an AI that went corrupt maybe? Which if that's the case it takes away the charm of the original. Serial killer who's about to die uses vodoo spell to posses a doll with plans to transfer his soul back into a human body. If Chucky is just a corrupt AI here than that kinda kills the main premise of the whole original series. Cause getting a new body was the main motivation for the franchise. I mean they could just be showing how those dolls would be made Now. And not spoiling who's the series killer who takes over the doll. If that's the case then well done. But if that's not the case and he is just an AI gone corrupt then basically they've killed this reboot before it even gets started. You can't do child's play without the plot line that made the franchise.,1,0,Mr. Sinister,ZFy8ZgLd574,-0.055735930735930736,2019-02-08 23:37:30,True,True

2019-02-09T00:54:58,"As a HUGE fan of the Child's Play franchise, My thoughts on this new movie are honestly mixed. I'm excited for this. BUT.....I'm still trying my hardest to be skeptical about this reboot cause Child's Play was one of the 1st horror movies I've ever seen and it's the 1st classic (by classic I mean old school) horror movie I've watched and it's one of the few horror movies that got me into the horror genre and why I love horror movies today, so I want this remake to be made and treated with care even though Don Mancini and the other casts aren't gonna be apart of it and even though I'm a HUGE fan of the series, I'm being completely honest when I say not all of the movies are great. Here are my thoughts on the movies  Child's Play - A Classic  Child's Play 2 - A fun time Child's Play 3 - Watchable but can be mediocre Bride of Chucky - A very fun guilty pleasure  Seed of Chucky - Not Good Curse of Chucky - A sequel that respects the franchise Cult of Chucky - A very deep and thoughtful sequel  So I honestly like all of the Chucky movies except for Child's Play 3 and Seed of Chucky. Child's Play 3 is okay and is self aware of what it is, but Seed of Chucky is by far the worst movie in the franchise.  As a person who loves this franchise, I WILL be seeing this movie and I want it to be a success. Btw the producers of ""IT"" are making this, so it can't be terrible, but I will be counting days until the time of waiting is up and the watch and judgement shall be revealed.",74,30,Eli B's Movie Reviews!,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.07212878787878786,2019-02-09 00:54:58,True,True

2019-02-09T00:58:40,I fought 15 guys at once. Fully armed to the teeth. Ak-47s and Grenades. One had a rocket launcher. All I had was my bare hands tied behind my back on to a chair. I flipped back and broke the chair. One guy lunged his rifle barrel at my stomach but I caught it and twisted it just in time for him to pull the trigger and shoot the ceiling. I flung the gun hard to hit his face with the stock. The second guy came at me with a knife. I quickly twisted his hand and took control by getting around him with the knife at his neck. The other 13 were in front of me. Holding their fire. I shoved him into 3 of them. Shifted right and flipped another to the ground. Slid onto the floor to scoop another guys legs. I quickly crawled behind the counter as the other 8 fired lead into it. I was able to get a hold of another knife. Thank god. I flung it at one from around the corner of the counter. As the 7th tried to slide over the counter. I kicked him in the nuts. Picked him up with his gun to his head. 6 guys right in front of me. I did it again. Pushed the enemy into another 2 guys. Leaving 2 on the left and two on the right. Before the ones on the right could react I grabed one and twisted his wrist extended his arm shoving my hand in his face. Quickly broke his elbow out of place and flipped him. Kicked the other guy in the balls and knocked him out with a quick powerful punch. The other two stood there in shock on the other side of the bodies. Dropped their guns and put their hands up. I ran at them and dropped kicked them both in the face. I left the door after throwing two Grenades in there with them.

So his mother gets him a “buddi” doll to have as a companion that can relate to him. When the doll scanned his face it probably to know how to act around Andy. The doll feels Andy grief which causes the doll to get protective of Andy and start killing.

Its a remake but its supposed to be different. this is a TEASER, of course they aren't going to show the doll. The whole idea of remakes is the bring in new audiences to spread the child's play legacy, but also makes us question all the things we have in your homes and phones that have basically all our information. I think this is a better spin for this day and age. don mancini (the creator of child's play) originally didn't even want voodoo in the movie  it was all supposed to be andy initially but the studio changed it.

MGM has the rights to the first movie, this is why they can make this happen, but they won't reboot the franchise as a whole. Unless this movie is a hit and can spawn new sequels, but in its own universe.  2) This is a solid trailer and it actually makes me interested in checking it out. Will it have an army of Chuckies?  3) These are the only things I ask for: a script that is mostly consistent/makes sense with characters I can get behind (the original movies have cheesy moments, they're not flawless, but come on, at least be on their level please), and I absolutely want animatronic effects for the dolls. Do that, and I'll watch it.

Upon hearing about this reboot or remake I was a little bit skeptical about the whole AI robot Chucky. But understanding why the production company chose to go this route makes sense and just thinking about it makes perfect sense in todays standards. If the company followed the same suite as the original movie, then there's really no need for a reboot. They did the same thing with ""IT"" and I'm pretty sure some people weren't on board with the new Pennywise because they didn't think that no one could top Tim Curry, but Bill Skarsgård killed it. So the same goes with this movie and we also get the producers of ""IT"" as well. I'm on board and I can't wait and as for the people who's saying that we didn't get to see Chuckys face or hear him talk...just think about the first Venom trailer that we got, we didn't get anything in that first trailer either.",0,0,Nashawn Cooper,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.16022727272727272,2019-02-09 16:05:27,True,True

I found it a bit offputting how they created ""new"" historical nemeses for Chucky who were never referenced in the earlier movies (sure, sure, hindsight is 20/20 'n all...) I personally found the last film ""Cult"" to be incoherent and boring (the idea of one soul inhabiting myriad hosts didn't ""jibe"" with me, plus the presence of Tiffany in human form seemed to both retcon and yet confirm that ""Bride"" and ""Seed"" happened..?)  Anyhoo, I'm guessing this new iteration is going for an ""A.I. Malfunction"" angle and that's potentially cool too, even if Chucky is no longer a sentient ""human"".

2019-02-09T17:44:48,"No Brad voicing Chucky? No longer a possessed doll, but a robot?    Damn, that's sad. I have a feeling I'm gonna like the TV series being made by the original makers much more than this movie, which is made by others.  Chucky is supposed to be a freaking creep, with a lot of comical murder to it.   This will just purely be scary. Chucky is supposed to make you laugh too! Kind of like Tim Curry's IT was funny.   The original IT in my opinion was much better. The new one felt rushed...  The fat kid and the black kid barely seemed to be much of big characters, but in the original, the character development of each kid was amazing!   I'm not one of those people that always things the original is better than the remake...  But it often is.   I can admit that the Halloween movie that came out about a decade or so ago,  that showed Michael as a kid too, was AN AMAZING remake. Hands down better than the original, although the original is truly classic and fun to watch.",29,11,Donald J. Trump,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.2662323232323232,2019-02-09 17:44:48,True,True

Either way I put my expectations for this film as low as I normally do with horror remakes these days.  God forbid some worthless jackass filmmaker calling himself an artist has to actually do something artistic by creating an original idea and crafting a movie around it.  Hey release another Paranormal Activity, Conjuring or Saw movie while you are at it because dumb mother fuckers love to eat that shit up too.  God!  What happened to the horror genre!?!?  Oh yeah... it became all about torture porn and cheap jump scares as opposed to nail biting suspense, haunting imagery and memorable characters.

2019-02-09T18:50:55,"Ok, for those of you who are confused about this, Orion Pictures maintains the rights to the ORIGINAL Child's Play. Therefore, this reboot takes it in a different direction (no Don Mancini, no Brad Dourif or Charles Lee Ray, no voodoo). Don Mancini has been still developing sequels to his original film with the latest being Cult of Chucky. THIS film is in no way connected to that, as is obvious with the ""reboot"" nature of it and the drastic changes to the source material. This film will poise Chucky as an A.I. gone awry. Most people hate this idea as it bears similarities to ""Terminator"" and ""I, Robot"". Obviously someone greenlit this thing so we'll see how it pans out this summer. Like I said it's based on a rights issue and perhaps the only reason this film got made was to capitalize on the character before the rights to the first film went to Don himself.",2,1,Mtn Drew,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.10833333333333334,2019-02-09 18:50:55,True,True

2019-02-09T20:29:15,"I live for Chucky!!! ♡ I love creepy dolls and eerie movies. The original Child's Play always creeped me out. I love it to this day! I just watched it a few weeks ago even lol The 2nd and 3rd were ok, after that it just got worse and worse. It's a miracle if I even watch any of the generic sequels they make anymore. I've seen almost all of the films, but only once for most of the sequels. So I wouldn't even know how many there are. I tried to watch the newest one and didn't even finish it. 😂 I did watch Bride of Chucky, and Seed of Chucky, back when they came out. I've only seen Seed once or twice. And Bride several times. They're ok for a random movie to watch, they're not horrible for their genre. Although I'm not a big fan of horror comedy unless it's well done. But they're alright. It's been so long since I watched Seed, that I don't remember it. But I'm excited for this. I actually am very happy that they are making so many horror remakes. I enjoy it. Now, do I still think the originals are best? Well duh. And do I still want good, new horror movies made? Of course! I don't watch remakes and compare them to originals. I don't expect them to be the same. Or always have the same iconic scenes, quotes, or anything else. It's nice when they have those things, but I don't need them. Because I don't want to think of it as the same thing. I like to watch it as a new thing. It's own story, just inspired by another. That helps me enjoy it more, and not be so letdown. If I expect a movie to be identical to the original, I'm going to be extremely disappointed. So I don't see it that way. Instead, I see it as a way to bring the oroginal movie back into the spotlight. For everyone. Especially younger people who might not have seen it. And it's exciting too. It kind of brings back all those nostalgic feels for us who grew up with it. I love it! And it's something to get curious about if we've seen the original.  We might love the originals and hold high standards for remakes. But at the end of the day, if you don't like the remake, it doesn't mean anything for the original. The original will still be here, and still be enjoyed by the same amount of people, and probably even more so after the remake.",0,0,Sarah Verity,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.1986992362146051,2019-02-09 20:29:15,True,True

2019-02-10T00:17:52,"Finlandia: Los medios de comunicación cubren la noticia del Foro del Parlamento sobre la sustracción forzada de órganos  ) Un foro sobre la sustracción forzada de órganos llamó la atención de los medios de comunicación más prominentes de Finlandia. Los periódicos más importantes del país, Helsingin Sanomat, Metro, Aamulehti, Lapin Kansa y 11 medios de comunicación de Internet publicaron noticias sobre el foro que se celebró en el Parlamento finlandés en Helsinki el 13 de noviembre.   El foro fue organizado por la diputada Eva Biaudet. Varios invitados pronunciaron discursos, entre ellos Ethan Gutmann, periodista y escritor que ha investigado la sustracción de órganos, Heikki Mäkisalo, experto en trasplantes de órganos del Hospital Central de la Universidad de Helsinki, y Marja Heinonen-Guzejevilta, experta en ética médica.    Marja Heinonen-Guzejev dijo a los asistentes al foro que un artículo publicado en The American Journal of Transplantation en 2016 mostró que el 63% de los órganos suministrados a las cirugías de trasplante en el mundo provenían de China. Dijo que muchos países han aprobado leyes que prohíben a sus ciudadanos obtener trasplantes de órganos en China, incluyendo Taiwán, Israel, España, Italia y Noruega. También sugirió que se utilicen técnicas de ADN para recopilar más pruebas.    Heinonen-Guzejev también mencionó la recién fundada Coalición Internacional para Acabar con el Abuso de Trasplantes, un tribunal independiente que tiene como objetivo investigar a organizaciones gubernamentales e individuos involucrados en la sustracción forzada de órganos en China.    Varios periódicos y medios de comunicación de Internet publicaron el artículo ""El trasplante de órganos en China solo requiere unas pocas horas: La mayoría de los órganos provienen de prisioneros de conciencia"". El artículo señala que la mayoría de las víctimas de este crimen son practicantes de Falun Dafa.    Helsingin Sanomat dijo a los lectores que en China los prisioneros de conciencia son sometidos con frecuencia a pruebas de sangre y ADN. Si un paciente necesita unos órganos, los hospitales del gobierno pueden organizar la cirugía en pocas horas.    ""China realiza más de 100.000 cirugías de trasplante de órganos cada año. La verdad es que se trata de una violación de los derechos humanos y una matanza a gran escala"", afirma el artículo.   El artículo también presentó a Falun Dafa, como una práctica de mejoramiento personal que beneficia el cuerpo y la mente. El artículo decía que antes de que el partido comunista chino lanzara la persecución en julio de 1999, más de 70 millones de personas en China practicaban Falun Dafa. El número de cirugías de trasplante de órganos en China ha aumentado exponencialmente desde que comenzó la persecución.",0,0,退出共产党（退出党团队）,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.0,2019-02-10 00:17:52,True,True

You see when someone comes up with an idea they transform it into art..good or bad it is art that they are proud of. The past 12 years have been filled with 100's of imitations or retellings that have shit over it you know why. Because in hollywood they take something that was a success and extremely popular back in the day to cash in on it now a days and when the original creator isn't involved it tends to lose not only authenticity but real value such as being remembered as something more than a cash cow. everyone knows they are no original artistic people anymore like someone such as philip k dick and nostalgia sells so they try to cash in on rehashes. I'm not against reboots if done right and i might be surprised by this one although as a mancini fan i know to me it wont hold a torch to the original but Highlander They Live Escape from New York Big trouble in Little China Masters of the universe Jacob's Ladder The Crow Labyrinth All planned remakes because we all know 80's-mid90's are the most popular to emulate for a generation with no good memorable originality.

Not saying boys can’t play with dolls, but nobody is going to play with a big ugly Chuckie doll it’s just not something kids do nowadays. Now legos I could see. If they wanted to make a creepy doll movie they could’ve done so and made it about a cute American Girl doll or something. That would’ve been more realistic. Also no one today is going to believe or get into grown ass adults running away from and being terrorized by a damn doll. That concept just doesn’t work anymore. This reboot is going to crash and burn because it’s just a cash grab.

2019-02-10T18:16:05,I'm so excited for this. This movie franchise needed a fresh reboot for years now I'm glad mgm retained the rights for the first movie i hope this movie does great this june. It looks awesome hopefully the story is good. I love the hi tech chucky im just disappointed that brad declined to voice the hi tech chucky he definitely let alot of fans down just cause don wasn't part of it that goes to show some celebrities dont care about their fans. I really hope the new voice is good ... Don was ruining chucky by to much comedy and very lil horror with stupid jokes and jennifer telly. He finally got the hint and the 2013 and 2017 movies were really good. I hope his tv series does good. Im just glad we are getting a fresh new story and chucky i just wanted the iconic voice but hey maybe the new one will be better if not atleast good enough to make fans accept it.

Also, I really think that they’re abandoning the wise cracking Chucky and sticking with a scarier and more serious Chucky. Maybe he doesn’t even talk much. The way he kills people is obviously looking way more elaborate which I’m kinda iffy on. On the one hand, that noose machine Andy’s mom was hooked up to looked pretty cool, but, on the other hand, that’s just not who Chucky is. He’s a slasher, not a Saw wannabe. He supposed to be somewhat smart or, at the very least, not just a stupid killing machine, not a goddamn engineer. This looks like he has no motive as well. I may be wrong about that, but it looks like Chucky is gonna be an unaware killing machine/an AI with no personality.

One other important factor was what made the original child's play so important to begin with to create this long legacy thus far and that was the use of  *VooDoo*  ! Having a criminal cast his soul over into the next object before he died was a genius idea for a way to keep this killer alive so he could continue his petty criminal life! 🔫  There's only _one_ thing that's either going to *make this movie good or make this movie bad* and that's going to be the _voice_ .

I am a huge fan of the original Child's Play, it terrified me as a child, but once I was 14 I was able to watch the films and not be scared, and genuinely enjoy them. I enjoyed the first three, Bride, and even Curse. That being said however, I felt that the original series has gone off the rails with Cult of Chucky. I felt Cult of Chucky was an absolute nightmare, it made Andy into a complete moron, there were countless loose ends, and it felt more like a parody than an actual installment. In other words, I think Child's Play actually NEEDS a proper reboot. The series just feels like something that needs to die off because its no longer scary. But because Chucky is so popular, we don't want to see him totally die but at the same time we're sick the same thing over and over again.

2019-02-12T14:16:30,"I was explaining to my friends on Twitter that Brad Dourif could not just only be the patron of the reboot but will do an uncredited role as the voice of Chucky in a sinister turn in the reboot. Brad is known to do these roles as surprise appearances, especially in Ready Player One and a Calvin Harris Video to name a few. Brad Dourif had been an Acting Teacher in colleges and universities for thousands of Actors and Actresses since early 80's, he brings out the best in the cast and crew of movie makers, he even taught the Teenage Don Mancini in college. Brad was in Lord of the Rings and picked Billy Boyd to be as Glen Glenda, another lord of the rings star is Liv Tyler who was picked as Karen who turned it down and is replaced by Aubery Plaza. So, having saying that, Brad may be a quiet guy in real life however he knows who is good at acting in this or that, he is knowledgeable that way. Even Fiona like her father is not doing the ""Not my Chucky"" rant and she is starring in the TV Series so she is supporting her Father. The problem with Don Mancini, Jennifer Tilly, Alex Vincent, Christine Elise is they feel they won't get paid enough, but I don't see why they are paranoid because the reboot is going to boost the ratings as revival, and they need the help since Curse of Chucky is 5 million audience subtotal and Cult is down to 2 million audience subtotal. Brad is the Star, let's be honest, Brad is what people want in Child's Play, I think there is some tension and jealously towards Brad since he is the best actor in the world, and for a guy who quoted ""I am a whore when it comes to money"" to not be concerned along with his Daughter is astonishing to me, but I am not surprised about Brad's influence and knowledge of picking a cast that movie makers trust enough to make him do so. Chucky's voice in the Reboot/remake is STILL a massive mystery, still nobody knows who it is? My opinion that it is Bradders himself. This is brilliant marketing.",1,2,Mehtap Ciana,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.1995169082125604,2019-02-12 14:16:30,True,True

I was in my 20's in the 80's & remember the 1st MOVIE it was the BEST STORY OF THEM ALL!!.   I stop watching after all the other because they were losing the (FLAVOR) of why it was a HORROR movie in the 1st place!! I was mad!!.   the (Director of SAW) or hopefully the (DIRECTORS of IT) hopefully they can fix Chucky Genre because only a EXTREME HORROR Director hands down can fix the Chucky movie I never saw chucky movie to be a party style like. to me it should be Pure HORROR & Give him Demonic like presence because the Original the (BUM) was a Warlock known as a Witch with Demonic powers & he was a (SERIAL KILLER) & escaped into a DOLL that was the ORIGINAL & that is what made chucky HORROR FILM the BEST!!.   after that? the rest I think after Chucky 2? it started to become CHUCKY the ALCOHOLIC PARTY TIME LoL. it did not have a HEAVY HORROR to it!! I was MAD the Director who ever they were? just did not know what PURE HORROR MOVIE IS. I learn through all my years that there is (Light Horror), (medium horror) & than you have (HEAVY HORROR!!) that is for the most skillful Directors & Chucky should fit in the HEAVY HORROR MOVIE!! Hopefully they are bringing in the old ORIGINAL HORROR STORY of CHUCKY from the 1st one but with a Crazy twist to the story I don't mind some add on but make it that the New Generation will know that this was the old MAGIC from it's ORIGINAL TITLE.    yes I HOPE this movie will be EXTREMLY GOOD so the New Generation can learn that the original Chucky was the SHIT!! & it was a good Heavy Horror & very Suspence it also had a good sotry of (SUSPENCE IN IT) that is what chucky was ABOUT!!.   So anybody that knows what I'm talking about let these Baby movie watchers that this story is from the ORIGINAL CHUCKY not the CHUCKY they saw last!! 2012 whatever year!!

The T-1000 worked as an adult, humanoid cyborg, but as a killer toy, the premise isn't scary, and kind of gets ridiculous in light of the fact that Chucky is two foot tall and all Andy would have to do is to get Chucky wet. Siri stops talking when you dunk your I phone in water. Annable also explored the blood ritual that Don Mancini originally wanted to use as the mechanism for bringing Chucky to life. So I remain totally unimpressed with this.

The viral marketing campaign with the Kaslan Corporation has been really awesome and I think this was a fantastic first look. Fingers crossed that in the next trailer Chucky's reveal resonates with both new and old fans of the original and we finally get to hear his iconic laugh! Though I understand the reboot/remake fatigue in Hollywood now and days 'IT' was an amazing retelling (should I dare say better than the original? > .<) and this is being produced by the same people.  I always say, the originals aren't going anywhere and are always gonna be there if they somehow mess it up. Not to mention the original franchise is still continuing their story so us fans are kinda getting the best of both worlds/universes. I've lost count on how many times I've watched this, lol; couldn't help myself and made a mash-up trailer with Toy Story. Even as a kid I always thought that though very different, they kind of share the same concept. If anyone wants a quick laugh it's on my channel. Only thing i'm a little worried about is the voice but I have hope. So far we've gotten Halloween, 'IT', and are about to get Pet Semetary in 2 months! So pls Hollywood, if you're going to continue remaking these cherished horror/slasher franchises GIVE US A NEW NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET! Freddy holds a special place in my heart as i'm sure he does to millions of others and I know if given the right treatment our favorite glove wielding dream demon slasher can be resurrected for the new generation.

2019-02-13T22:01:42,My opinion on those that are commenting about Hollywood rebooting and not being creative... I think what's happening is that streaming like Netflix and whatnot are coming out with their own shows and more and more people are more in tuned to that. They're small series you don't have to pay attention to it and for very long. Which is the issue that we have nowadays are no one can really focus on something for very long. When it comes to Hollywood movies it seems you can't make too many varieties of movies anymore because not everyone wants to sit there for an hour and a half to two hours possibly two and a half hours on one thing because the attention span isn't there anymore. As you can notice even the theaters have less eating now that most theaters are getting recliners. I remember going to the theaters 10 years ago or more and all seats are almost always full and those were before recliners. Now the only time a reclining seat Theatre gets full is it big movie during opening weekend or at least the first week. It's a generational thing I think. But again this is just an opinion there's no fact behind this. Just something I've noticed,0,0,Aline Gosselin,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.16125000000000006,2019-02-13 22:01:42,True,True
2019-02-13T22:01:44,"Yo chief im gonna be real, i loved childs play as a kid, i loved it all the way up until about childs play 4. I mean personally i just thought childs play 3 was a bit boring but i think thats just because i dont remember much of it but i still loved it, just a bit boring to me. Anyways anymore it feels like they are ruining the franchise. I understand that maybe the constant recreation just isnt for me and perhaps others may like it but at the same time i think maybe we should just leave it alone at some point? The last chucky was honestly just hollywood taking a shit on the entire thing. It was so bad that i can barely remember what even happened in that movie. All i remember is that there were so many chuckys and the plot was just all over the place. It made no sense. It isnt like they were going for a non linear plot either, if they were it would have it would have been much more organized however all we got was a bunch of low budget good guy dolls running around. I don't mean to shit on someone elses work but im afraid this series is just getting strung out just to make a little cash. I think the original first few did an amazing job at showing the killer doll's life and it gave the viewers all the information they needed on him while still leaving them on the edge of their seats wanting more. They expanded the universe, introduced new characters, kept the og main character as the main character for the most part until they got up to seed of chucky but even then that movie expanded the universe and provided us with some good content and more insight on chucky.

They won’t get me down; they won’t get us down. They tried it in Spain; they tried it in Russia; they tried it in Germany; they’re trying it in America. The only bad things are those that come out from within; this garbage goes in from without - but it does come from within those promoting this stuff - so that is where the garbage is: in those big Hollywood parties where they use children and then destroy their lives.

I didn't hate this teaser. Which is quite a shocker. I liked it. Yes. It is another horror remake, but I really liked the fact that this teaser really did not give that much away.  I liked the song choice and how it was edited, the kid looks like he is pretty decent, Aubrey Plaza in a role like this is intriguing, the lighting in the trailer was nice. I loved the use of reds and blues. And overall the idea behind it I don't mind. It's like Child's Play meets Small Soldiers. And it most definitely looks like it will be a hard R. I liked seeing the bits of practical effects.  It is not any worse or as insulting as Don Mancini's last 4 sequels as i felt 3 was the last Child's Play movie for me. So yeah, it looked interesting to me. I was curious about it anyway. So this teaser definitely helped pique my interest. I am still very leery of it but I am going to give it a chance..

2019-02-23T10:19:39,"In all fairness, lets be honest, we're in 2019, so many things have been invented and ideas used, especially in movies, how many more originals ideas do you think there are? Even if it was ""original"" somebody would complain that its similar to something else.  In all honesty these are inevitable and i personally prefer to have it be our favorite characters than someone nobody cares about, its not going to be the same, but things could always be worse, its hard to keep anybody happy, especially everyone, nobody is ever satisfied for the most part lol, especially if you're critiquing everything and comparing it to the originals, people dont live forever so our heroes, villains and icons will change over time, things never stay the same, me personally, id rather enjoy something than be disappointed so i dont compare things cause then you're setting yourself up for your own disappointment, you have to treat everything as its own thing cause even if its a part of the same story or series, chances are not everyone involved the first time will be there every single time to follow after.  Yeah im more excited and interested about the show cause its brad dourif and following some characters we know, and new ones, but if you think about it, chucky in fact was a robotic toy back then though not as advanced at the time, only difference is, this one is more advanced and is technically possibly self aware and or malfunctioned or purposefully was altered, who knows, and back then it was a lower quality robot doll but with charles lee ray's soul put inside of it, chucky was high end back then, nobody thought of him as a robot cause he had a soul but the regular dolls responded when talked too and had phrases and such, a regular toy put together could not do that, it had to have some sort of intelligence or chip involved which yes does equal robot, it wasnt just toy parts alone, just my opinion though, the only real difference is just not having a soul this time in terms of chucky himself",0,0,Joseph Gonzales,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.16383907758907762,2019-02-23 10:19:39,True,True

2019-02-26T01:25:53,"WANT TO MAKE THOUSANDS FAST??? JOIN OUR MAIL CLUB I PROMISE YOU WONT REGRET THIS! AND YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE!     It’s not hard to make money!    How To Turn Six Dollars Into Six Thousand Dollars: I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little while back I was browsing    through newsgroups just like you are now and came across an article similar to this that    said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of    $6.00! So I thought ""Yeah right this must be a scam"" but like most of us I was curious    so I kept reading. Anyway it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and    address stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of    the list at #6 and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands) No    catch that was it. So after thinking it over and talking to a few people first I thought    about trying it. I figured: ""what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00 right?""    Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... within 7 days I started getting    money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon but the money just kept    coming in. In my first week I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had    made a total of over $1000.00! In the third week I had over $10000.00 and it's still    growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42000.00 and    it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00 and 6 stamps I have spent more    than that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most importantly WHY it    works... Also make sure you print a copy of this article NOW so you can get the    information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly    that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so    easy!    Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download it.) Follow the    simple directions and watch the money come in!    It's easy. It's legal. And your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage)    IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk -    it really works!    If all of the following instructions are adhered to you will receive extraordinary dividends.    PLEASE NOTE:    Please follow these directions EXACTLY and $50000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60    days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the    participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions.    You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your product is not    solid and tangible it's a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many    large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However the money made    from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from people like you and    me asking to be included in that list.    Here are the 4 easy steps to success:    STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper    ""PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST."" Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE    inside    EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent    thievery). Next place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should    now have 6 sealed envelopes each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase your    name and address and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS    ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for    it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it    all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed    that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:  I am slowly trying to switch this over to a Cash App thing to rid of the postage cost! and so much mail! So that is why some is Cash App and some is Regular Mail.    #1) J. Linley    4324 Beechgrove Dr.    Grove City, OH 43123    #2) https://cash.me/$only1casso    #3) https://cash.me/$john    #4) https://cash.me/$jessica    #5) https://cash.me/$doloveexsist    #6) https://cash.me/$daniel    STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above move the other names up    (6 becomes 5 5 becomes 4 etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list.    STEP 3: Change anything you need to but try to keep this article as close to original as    possible. Now post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are    close to 24000 groups) All you need is 200 but remember the more you post the more    money you make! You won't get very much unless you post like crazy.    This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the    Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and whenever you need    money you can use it again and again.    PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty and    integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this    way. If you are of integrity the program will continue and the money that so many others    have received will come your way.    NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you either on a computer    or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are truly    providing a service. (Also it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to    reduce the risk of mail theft.)    So as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed six members will be    reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar each. Your name will    move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will    be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for    each of the first six people listed above) Send it now add your own name to the list and    you're in business!    ---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------    Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put    your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this    document and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the    computer's memory.    Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page.    From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so    that you can add your name to the list.    Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your postings in    different settings you'll always have this file to go back to.    Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various newsgroups    (on-line forums message boards chat sites discussions.)    Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message by highlighting    the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject this will    be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a    particular group click the post message button. You're done with your first one!    Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post    away after you get the hang of it it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup!    **REMEMBER THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN THE MORE MONEY YOU    WILL MAKE!    BUT :    YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** That's it! You will begin receiving money from    around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large    amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous you can invent a name to    use as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE    CORRECT.**    Now each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings    each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5 that is    another $25.00 for me now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4    and only 5 replies each I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now those 125 persons turn    around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each I    will make an additional $625.00! OK now here is the fun part each of those 625 persons    post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies    that just made me $3125.00!!! Those 3125 persons will all deliver this message to 200    newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will    receive $1562500! With an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name    is no longer on the list you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups and send out    another $6.00 to names on the list putting your name at number 6 again. And start    posting again. The thing to remember is: do you realize that thousands of people all over    the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are    now!! So can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... People have said    ""what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the    chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest    people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a    try? Estimates are at 20000 to 50000 new users every day with thousands of those    joining the actual internet. Remember play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work! Youll Be Glad You Made The Effort !",1,0,Random ASMR,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.1622711598746082,2019-02-26 01:25:53,True,True

2019-03-03T23:45:03,This movie is a complete reboot so nothing will be the same as from the original movies.  They can’t they’ll get sued.   The real child’s play/chucky people are actually making a Tv Series based off the first movie called “ Child’s play”  to the last movie that was just out called “ Cult of chucky” and that will have All Original cast And director I believe..... 🤗  that’s going to be amazing I’m sure! 💁🏽‍♀️💁🏽‍♀️💁🏽‍♀️  This new movie is no way affiliated with original child’s play movie’s!!!

2019-03-04T00:02:50,Okay I'm not happy with this remake yeah yeah complain all u want but this doesn't feel right I know it's all new and improved but what made Chucky so scary in the original was that he didn't have any technology or anything special he was just a cute little innocent doll and he was actually alive and killer which scared people and watch the very first child's play movie trailer and compare to this their so different and if their was only 1 2 or even 3 chucky movies it would be fine to remake but nope theirs 7 and if u haven't seen the latest from last year cult of chucky I'm not gonna spoil it for u but they ended it with a cliffhanger begging for a sequel honestly and their gonna remake it? And well chucky being posessed by Charles Lee Ray was what made him scary cause he acted human he could bleed grow fingernails have sex and many more and chucky isn't posessed in the new 1 he's just a mindless robot and I will admit this is a pretty good and scary plot a animatronic being hacked and killing. But not for chucky cause people know him as a human stuck inside of a doll body constantly trying to get out but never succeeding and he's scary for his personality his dark sense of humor and creepy cackle + his shitty jokes and since he's a hacked robot I mean he could have a personality I could be wrong but even if he does it doesn't hold up as Brad Dourif and he's been voicing chucky since day 1 and has been doing this dolls voice for 30 years or more and Don Mancini the director of every child's play isn't directing it which won't help cause Don kept Chucky's charecter fresh never letting his charecter get old new jokes new plots and new kills in every movie and without Don or Brad the 2 people u depend on uh well oh. And what doesn't help is good guys being changed to buddi. I know it doesn't seem like it but if u go back along time ago in the 80s before child's play was out their was a doll named my buddy u might remember the doll if u think back but it had bright overalls and striped sleeves just like chucky and chucky was inspired by the doll but for copyright reasons they called the doll good guy which is pretty similar but even than my buddy was killed off cause of chucky. And it's been gone since the very first child's play movie and since it's the 200s now late 200s that doll has been forgotten by time and now they think they'll call it buddi which like still but cmon chucky already ruined Hasbro's huge hit toy back in the day give Hasbro a break. And chucky is known for being a tiny little pint sized asshole who gets away with tons of murders cause like I said just a normal doll with like 3 sentences but with the new ones technology it wouldn't let anybody pick him up cause he's protecting Andy which uh theirs nothing wrong with that but chucky is just a to himself person he only cares about himself and has no love for anyone but Tiffany and his kid Glenn/Glenda and even he's mean to his own wife he pretty much killed her in bride and he killed her in seed just saying he's a awful person and he will even go after his owner Andy to get his body. And after all he's done to Andy like get him put in a foster home pretty much kill everybody he loves make him get sent to a military school he destroyed Andy's childhood and theirs no forgiving for that. In the first 1 he hated chucky like 20 minutes into the movie after he killed aunt Maggie he hated chucky and tried to warn the adults but a course nobody would beleive a 6 year old kid who who's blaming murders on his beloved toy and Andy got blamed for the murders till his mom Karen found out the truth for herself and chucky escaped going on a killing spree through the city and well him being so smart with tons of technology it might be diffrent since Andy is older and he's 12 in this and his doll is full of technology it'd be easier to beleive chucky is responsible for the murders being a incredibly genius robot and even if they try to be like the first child's play and have tons of suspense till chucky finnaly reveals himself it won't be that scary cause we all no what's coming in the original child's play we were waiting till chucky would fully come out and he did like halfway through the movie putting chills down our spine as Karen starts realizing maybe Andy wasn't crazy after all and chucky really is alive and wants everybody dead so that's my long ass opinion on this child's play remake.,2,1,Brendan O'Rourke,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.061967073330709714,2019-03-04 00:02:50,True,True
2019-03-04T00:49:55,Theory: Chucky might be out killing people because of Andy. They said that the Buddi can play and learn like a real kid does. So maybe Andy watches like murder since they change him like 13 14 or 15 years old. He starts watching brutal videos. So Chucky might have watched it and learned to do those stuff and went on a killing free rampage. Or maybe Andy liked to prank the doll (or robot) duh this is a reebot so they decided to change it to a robot. So maybe it made trip and insulted it an then it's got enough and activated kill mode. Also i'd like add one more theory possibly hacked by Charles Lee Ray since in this movie they could keep him but instead he is hacker and wanted for hacking many Kaslan products. So those are my theories,4,1,NegZER0 Vid,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.1125,2019-03-04 00:49:55,True,True

I remember when he first came to life cursing like a sailor I wasn't sure to laugh or be scared.

Brad has been the voice of Chucky for 7 movies spanning 31 years. While I'm sure he will do great, horror fans are very critical of change in the properties they love. Jackie Earle Haley did fine as Freddy but he wasn't really given a chance simply because he wasn't Robert Englund. Same with Derek Mears and Ken Kirzinger in the role of Jason because they weren't Kane Hodder. Now I'm not hating here, I'm just saying I definitely don't envy him. I'm a fan of Hamill and I hope he knocks it out of the park, and if anyone has a shot at it, he does.

Why isn’t Chucky’s face not shown in the trailer? Also why couldn’t you do less animation and stick to the more original look? Another thought..... are you guys doing the same voice actor they used for basically all of the movies? Is he dead? Or are you guys not choosing to let him act Chucky? Will we ever see chuckys face? Will we ever hear his voice? I don’t know because none of that is in the trailer! CinemaSins needs to do this when it comes out! Unfortunately I’m not going to watch it, instead I’m going to watch all the other Chucky movies and then watch this one because I want to compare them.

2019-06-22T12:42:41,"I admit that in origin I was somewhat skeptical about this re-launch of the ""Child's play"", also because the saga of Don Mancini - the creator of Chucky - is still active and boasts seven chapters! Despite my skepticism, I went to the cinema and to my astonishment admit to having left the movie theater fully satisfied! The film is beautiful, well structured - in its simplicity of a horror film, this is obvious - and with an interesting and current reinvention; Examining the theme: (technology, use and abuse of everything that works with multiple wi.fi. connections) makes the film even more interesting and current, despite the unreality of the plot itself, but it is still a horror movie and we also like this! I became passionate about this film, so much so that - the next day - I returned to see it a second time, taking the invitation of some of my friends who still had to see it! However, although I really enjoyed the film, I have some small criticisms to raise; First of all, when you decide to reboot a brand and want to keep the same original title, it would be a good idea to insert a subtitle that distinguishes it from the official one (I suggest subtitles like: Rebirth 0 Reborn or Reborning 0 own Reboot)! Secondly, if you decide to make a reboot movie, you really need to diversify it to 100%! For example: the doll should not have been called Chucky (Buddy is more than good as a name); The child and his mother should have had different names (they didn't have to be the same characters in the original film) and maybe I would have called Chucky the very child himself! Andy and Karen Barclay could be the names of the policeman and his nice mom! Practically, to diversify the reboot and the original film in a more incisive way, but with quotations inserted in a different and apparently casual way; In this way, it would have worked even better, because it would have had a function similar to a ""reboot - spin off"" even if not official and canonical! The subtitle, perhaps, could have been ""RE - IMMAGINING""! However, it is only my personal observation; I repeat, the film is beautiful (I've seen it twice) but with these little elements ones I would have preferred it even more! Anyway, good movie.",31,1,boterjayer,ZFy8ZgLd574,0.21601851851851853,2019-06-22 12:42:41,False,True
