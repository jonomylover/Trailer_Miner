2016-05-26T09:26:16,"Alright, so I don't know what happened behind the scenes for this film, but what I'm really getting is a sense of 'let's rip off Zootopia.' There is no reason from what I can see in the trailer for the characters to be animals. Zootopia used the animal characters to not only set up a creative world, but also as an allegory for prejudice. This film's world looks completely bland, and there is no real creativity in how the animals interact with the world. Also, it looks like they attempted to do what Zootopia did with animals being different sizes, but failed spectacularly. Koalas are pretty small, and elephants are pretty big, so the fact that the koala is only 1/5 the size of the elephant is really bad character design.  Also, there's a fucktonne of pop music. To my recollection, Zootopia had only one real pop song in it, which was written specifically for the film. This, however, is chock-a-block full of outdated 2-5 year old pop music that I'm familiar with, but I can't imagine many kids in the target demographic would be familiar with. How old is 'Without You' again? Oh right, that song is 5 years old, which is pretty ancient in the current Pop scene. The song competition plot seems to be entirely tangential to the fact that animals are the main characters. You could easily make the same film Live Action and replace the animal characters with real people, and it would have been basically the same. Maybe even cheaper to make, since 3D animation is so expensive.  Overall, this is an awful trailer to what seems to be an awful film.",5,9,Sam Cannon,9qPgK_u4vX8,0.011385281385281387,2016-05-26 09:26:16,True,True

Yes, the animation is not as good as Zootopia... but it still looks colorful and nice since it is Illumination, and they're improving on their animation more and more.   Also, keep in mind, like everyone is saying this is a completely different plot than Zootopia, it's a musical animated film and none of the main characters are a fox or a bunny.   The main characters are a koala bear, two pigs, a mouse, a porcupine, a sheep, an elephant and a gorilla.   The one character who immediately grabbed my attention was the gorilla kid voiced by Taron Egerton, who played the main kid in Kingsman: The Secret Service. If that's him singing, WOW, he has a beautiful and soothing voice.

One has reptiles and mammals, and the other is only mammals. One is a mystery and the other is a singing competition. I personally thought this movie was gonna be a complete rip off from Zootopia, but I've seen Zootopia and they are both completely different. If anything after seeing Zootopia, I want to see this new movie even more. It's creative, well done, and looks like a lot of fun. Even though Zootopia came first and all, give Illumination some credit, they've probably been working on this movie for a while and was completely unknown to the fact that Zootopia was being made. So when zootopia came out, they had to start working faster and get this movie out quicker, otherwise it would seem like they were completely copying off of Zootopia. Give both movies some credit, they're both awesome.",50,2,Lily,9qPgK_u4vX8,0.1962566844919786,2016-05-29 12:51:36,True,True

They see what's popular among today's millennials.  Shows like Glee are hits because of good singing and mashups of popular songs.  They see that singing competitions like The Voice and America's Got Talent (which isn't strictly singing but has a lot of it) are insanely popular.  They see that teenagers can become stars in an instant by just posting a YouTube video of themselves singing, and having it go viral.  The notion that anyone can be famous in an instant is the general way of thinking right now among our young generation.  So they create the always-popular world with animals (see: Zootopia, Secret Life of Pets, Finding Dory) and have the plot center around a singing competition, and good singers of our time.  It's hard to keep up with Disney and Pixar, but this is a good move from a company that's so far really only known for the minions in Despicable Me.",1,0,GoldenWarrior7,9qPgK_u4vX8,0.21731601731601727,2016-07-26 06:14:01,True,True
