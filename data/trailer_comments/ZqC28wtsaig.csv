2017-02-08T22:01:19,"I'm getting to where I hate movie trailers.  They make all movies look the same.  Unlike TV where you have different commercials advertising the same product in movie trailers it's the same commercial advertising different movies.  I saw this film and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I prefer PG or PG-13 films instead of R because it forces film makers to be creative because they can't rely on the quick easy drama of tits, violence or cussing.",3,0,NelsonClick,ZqC28wtsaig,0.08787878787878788,2017-02-08 22:01:19,False,False

2019-02-26T23:07:59,"Something small that REALLY bugs me about this and a lot of other movies touching on the Holocaust: Mispronunciation of Bełżec. In the movie, it is pronounced ""Bell-Zek."" That's completely wrong.  In Polish, ł is pronounced ""wuh"" and ż is pronounced like the g in ""mirage"" or ""j.""  The c at the end is pronounced like ""ts."" So, the proper pronunciation of the death camp Bełżec is (more or less) ""Bwuhjets.""",0,0,WildwoodClaire1,ZqC28wtsaig,0.01979166666666667,2019-02-26 23:07:59,False,False
