2015-07-08T20:27:30,"To everyone complaining about this, let me clue you in on a few things.  1. Goosebumps is a CHILDREN'S book series. Obviously they're going to gear the film towards kids. If you were expecting the movie to be geared SOLELY to adults who grew up on Goosebumps...you're an idiot. 2. ""Why so much comedy?! Goosebumps is supposed to be scary!"" First of all, it should have been a clear sign that there would be comedy from the announcement that Jack Black was in this. Second of all, the books are meant to be scary to KIDS. It isn't Fear Street. People are actually expecting Slappy to be along the lines of Chucky? Um, when has Slappy ever actually KILLED anybody? Slappy is a schemer, all he does is play mean pranks to make people think his owners are crazy, so he can blackmail them to be his slaves. Slaves. That's his MO. What then, Slappy? Have them serve you orange juice? The books have ALWAYS had an element of absurdity to them. Living lawn gnomes that like to play pranks and tickle people? An evil sponge that's defeated by kindness? A giant hamster? The books are full of absurdities, that's what makes them fun. This movie's clearly going for that kind of angle. 3. ""The show was so much better than this! Where's the Goosebumps theme?!"" A) No it wasn't. The show was made on a limited budget, with child actors of varying degrees of acting capability, extremely cheap effects, and often mangled the books they were based on in adaptation. B) You can't know that a low budget children's show is better than a big-budget children's film until you've actually SEEN the film. And C) TAKE OFF YOUR DAMN NOSTALGIA GOGGLES! 4. R.L. Stine is in FULL support of this film, I've seen his twitter feed, he is promoting the hell out of this movie, constantly praising it, and has worked closely with the filmmakers on it.

At all. From the videos that I've seen of the actual author, he's really humble and not such jack-ass. I wasn't really excited about Jack Black playing him either, but I'm even more upset that it seems like he's being written to act like an ass.  2: the design of the monsters. Some of them look okay and very close to the original book covers. But from what I'm seeing with a lot of them is that they're not even remotely scary. They don't have to look down right terrifying (since this is being made for kids and adults alike) but at the very least, try and make them at least creepy.

I mean, I would have settled for at least a REMIX of the original theme tune, but that's just me.  And yes, it IS for kids, I don't expect Edgar Allan Poe when I look into something Goosebumps related, but my problem is that it looks too... chaotic for Goosebumps.  Like, there are dozens of things going on, we got half a dozen protagonists, about a hundred monsters and Jack freakin' Black as R.L. Stine. My problem isn't that is is ""kiddy"", because I understand the target audience, and after looking closer I can appreciate the attention given to the Goosebumps universe.  My problem is that it looks like it is just going to give into the assumption that the attention span of children is about half a second.  Kids today don't have as short attention spans as most people in Hollywood would think, but this looks really REALLY chaotic.  I can appreciate some things presented, and I understand it is not intended for me- I and many other people my age are simply here because we had fond memories of what we grew up with.  The original intent of Goosebumps was to get our young selves interested in reading, and if this film manages to rekindle an interest in the franchise for kids of today, then maybe we can get them to pick up a book and become interested.

As an adult, the Goosebumps books may not frighten us; however, the tone of the books was serious, as the characters we're in peril from something they didn't understand. Where as, judging entirely by the trailer, this movie is extremely lighthearted in tone, and it seems is is meant to generate more laughs than scares, which is opposite of the Goosebumps formula. It seems to be parodying the Goosebumps mythos instead of adapting one good story to screen. And because it is a parody, it could be setting itself up for failure like Starsky & Hutch, Green Hornet, and Avatar: The Last Air Bender (which I'm counting as a parody, cause that's the only way that movie makes sense). This movie will generate some slight sales from families of young children going to see it, and of course the nostalgia factor, but over all this movie could flop hard.",2,0,Johnny Parker,7Cn716jv61s,-0.07708333333333331,2015-07-09 03:35:51,True,True

The books/episodes thrived on themes of the bizarre and fantastical, but also on eeriness and nightmare-inducing notions and characters. That was the fun of it. That was Goosebumps. So now, we're getting a cluster-fuck of every Goosebump creation unleashed in a silly facade of CGI-heavy debauchery which will probably include predictable plot twists and character arcs, cringeworthy dialogue, and a good ol' dosage of Hollywood stereotypes/tropes ala the ""new to the neighborhood, always gets detention bad boy gaining some form of heroic redemption,"" and his misfit best friend who helps him and probably finds love along the way (with buck teeth of course!). Oh, and while we're talking about Hollywood, EVERYONE IS WHITE. And while I love me some Jack Black, this trailer suggests a really bad under-utilization of his talents, which is a damn shame because he could probably make a great R.L.

But the concept is cute and I like the nostalgia factor, the latter of which EVERY adult should see this movie as. Like others have said, the original book series wasn't meant to be pure horror, but more like kiddie thrillers. They freaked us out as kids because we WERE kids, the target demographic. This movie is targeting a new generation of possible fans (they're gonna have to reprint the series) and, in a small way, us. It's a FAMILY film that parents who grew up on Goosebumps can take their kids to see, as a way of sharing in the experience. It'll also give parents a helpful nudge in persuading kids to read.

2015-07-11T10:56:05,"So... I have watched this trailer a few times now. Um... So, we see a lot of awesome references in this trailer. I was able to name a lot of them. But... So... Yeah... We see the Ferris wheel rolling after the characters... But at no point in this trailer, nor in any images I'm finding anywhere, have I seen a Horrorland Horror. I'm really hoping this is going to be a late reveal, or they don't reveal it in a trailer at all, and save the enjoyment for when we watch the movie... But it better have at least one Horrorland Horror. I say this because, aside from being my personal favorite Goosebumps creation, it is a major fan favorite. So much so that Stine decided to write a sequel, and then a Horrorland-centric series, it has been the subject of two video games, a board game, and a Tiger handheld game. It is a major icon of Goosebumps, and in a movie where they ""release all"" of R.L. Stine's creations, it needs a Horror. But, I will say, seeing the Ferris wheel gives me a lot of hope for that.",0,0,Jared Gillenwater,7Cn716jv61s,0.10989583333333336,2015-07-11 10:56:05,True,True

It's freaking Goosebumps in a $85 million dollar production! And it's not so scary you can't bring your kids to go see it. All those 10-15 year olds that we're reading those books are now in their 30's and a lot with families. If you are saying this is going to suck because of Jack Black then you just don't like Jack Black. However, the quality of a movie depend far more on one actor. From what I can see in the trailer he does great. The books were aimed at kids so it's not a big surprise the movie wouldn't be a blood-gore-shit-your-pants-terrifying experience. They may have creeped us all out as kids but that's because we were kids and got spooked by anything kind of creepy. So if you see it bring a 10 year old and ask him if he thought it was scary when the werewolf was chasing them, or if he got creeped out at the very sight of the living dummy.

2015-07-14T21:31:23,"Jesus christ guys, this is not a remake or adaptation even. It is a completely original story. They are making a comedy movie that is based around this idea of releasing all the monsters. I believe it is a genius idea. For one thing, it is a fantastic example of what these nostalgia movies should be. Don't make a half-assed not as good remake, make an original story that continues it or provides a new angle. It is supposed to both bring in old fans who will enjoy the references and finally seeing these monsters in realistic HD CGI, and kids who have never read Goosebumps and will go see the movie. Of course they aren't making an adult horror film as that only services a niche market of people who firstly read Goosebumps as kids, and secondly, still give a shit. Finally, those complaining about it not seeming scary. In case you haven't watched/read 90s Goosebumps in the past 10 years, it isn't scary to anyone but pre-teens. They are fun stories based on 50s horror and scifi for children. Not only that, but in today's world of gory horror and found footage and demons, yetis, living puppets, deranged botanists, spooky skeletons, giant man-eating bugs, and especially werewolves just aren't going to cut it as believably scary. Imagine people who watch the Gallows, Sinister 2, Insidious Chapter 3, and the Conjuring 2 planning to go see a scary movie about these things.  TL;DR - Goosebumps wouldn't even be scary to today's kids. It isn't a remake, it's a comedy based on the stories of Goosebumps. I will only judge the movie based on reviews, but the trailer made me laugh, I liked the CGI, and the cast looks great so I have high hopes.",0,0,TrailerParkThor,7Cn716jv61s,0.03790719696969696,2015-07-14 21:31:23,True,True

2015-08-21T17:07:40,"""You've just released every monster I've ever created!""  Okay, a few questions.  First of all, R.L. Stine has written a TON of stuff.  When he says ""every monster,"" does he mean EVERY monster, or just the monsters from the original Goosebumps line?  Furthermore, not all of the monsters in the Goosebumps books were bad.  Some of them tried to help the protagonist, and in some cases the protagonist turned into a monster at the end, or they were revealed to be monsters the whole time.  Are they included, or do only the villainous monsters get free?  Also, what does this movie define as a ""monster""?  Some of the Goosebumps villains are humans with magical powers, like Sarabeth from Monster Blood or El Sidney from Bad Hare Day.  Do they get free, or is it only non-humans?    And is there a limit as to how many monsters per book can escape?  I'm inclined to say ""no,"" since we see an army of lawn gnomes in the trailer.  But this makes things really complicated when you consider that some of the Goosebumps books show us (or at least imply) entire populations of monsters.  ""Calling All Creeps"" ends with the entire school turning into creeps.  Do all of them get free, or is it just the three or four that started it all?  To make matters worse, ""The Blob That Ate Everyone"" ends with the reveal that the entire story was written by a couple of blob monsters, which implies that they live in some alternate universe populated by blob monsters.  Does every blob monster in the neighborhood get free, or just the two we see?  And what about accessories or items that turn people INTO monsters?  Will we see the Werewolf Skin or the Haunted Mask lying around somewhere, doing nothing?    I kind of want to see the movie just so I can have all of these questions answered.",1,0,fdrdevotee,7Cn716jv61s,0.06195454545454547,2015-08-21 17:07:40,True,True

Molesto por tener que mudarse de una gran ciudad a un pueblo, el adolescente Zach Cooper (Dylan Minnette) descubre el lado positivo de las cosas cuando conoce a una bella muchacha, Hannah (Odeya Rush), quien vive exactamente puerta de por medio, y además se hace amigo rapidamente de Champ (Ryan Lee). Pero aún las cosas positivas tienen desventajas, y Zach lo descubre cuando se entera que el misterioso padre de Hannah es el mismísimo R.L. Stine (Jack Black), el autor de la serie de best-sellers Goosebumps. A medida que Zach empieza a aprender cosas sobre la extraña familia que vive en la casa de al lado, pronto descubre que Stine esconde un peligroso secreto: las criaturas que  sus historias hicieron famosas son reales, y Stine proteje a sus lectores al mantenerlos encerrados en sus libros. Cuando las creaciones de Stine son liberadas por error de sus manuscritos, la vida de Zach da un vuelco aún más extraño. En una alocada noche de aventuras, dependerá de Zach, Hannah, Champ, y Stine el unirse para volver a meter a todos esos productos de la imaginación de Stine, entre ellos Slappy el muñeco viviente, la chica con la máscara maldita, los gnomos y muchos más, otra vez en los libros, el sitio en el que pertenecen, para poder salvar al pueblo.

2015-10-12T01:04:01,"You know, I've been thinking a lot recently about how this getting a much more positive reception than the upcoming Jem movie. Obviously these are both cash cow opportunities by the studios to exploit our nostalgia. There's no doubt about that. And the plots for both are nothing new: Jem is the standard young, ordinary person dreams of making it big and does but at the possible cost of her friendships and new love interest, until of course she realizes what's more important (three guesses as to what she chooses). Goosebumps is just Jumanji but with monsters.  With Jem though, they don't appear to be doing anything particularly interesting or new with the source material, just retelling the same bland story, and just giving it a cheap Jem paint job. Aside from the costumes and character names, nothing really seems to retain the charm of the show. Literally, you can swap out Jem and put in any other character and it wouldn't change a thing. Also, the apparent lack of the Misfits and Synergy takes away even more of the show's identity. Goosebumps on the other hand not only brings colorful eye candy to the movie, but also major fan appeal by including just about every single monster from the series and making Slappy (the series unofficial mascot) their leader. And the fact that they're taking a meta approach to the material gives it a unique twist. Again, they're actually trying something different with a standard story.

You would think negatively of it to, if you were a deadpool fan. Of course, if you didn't know about it, you would be like ""oh, okay"". Now, another flaw that could also raise red flags.

2016-04-04T02:35:35,For the guys who like horror stories RL stine has actual horror books... For example Dangous Girls... It makes twilight look like an episode of spongebob.... Not that spongebob cant make twilight look like bambi... It reminds me of a cross between friday the thirteenth... Jenifers Body... And scream.... It probably didnt get enough veiws because Stine undersold it... He should have named it Bitten... And should have Discribed it on the back of the book a little more seriously... I dont know maybe something like this... Destiny and Livi Weeler are two girls who recently lost their mother who comitted suicide and in trying to cope with their loss they decided to be councelors at camp blue moon... Things go terribly wrong when a psycodic man with a mysterious secret finds both the girls interesting prey... Read more in the book...
