2018-10-04T18:34:36,"I am really excited to see this film as I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, however, I am a bit concerned. Like Ridley Scott, I think Clint Eastwood is an outstanding director, but also an inconsistent one. Sometimes he makes great films like Unforgiven, Letters from Iwo Jima, Million Dollar Baby, and Gran Torino, sometimes he makes god-awful movies like Jersey Boys, J. Edgar, the 15:17 to Paris, and sometimes he makes average movies like American Sniper (sorry if anyone loved it, but I don't love it nearly as much as everyone else) and Sully. While that is a pretty good filmography overall, I still think it's wildly inconsistent. Hopefully this one turns out to be one of the great films as this looks amazing.",0,1,Timothy Lee,N_QksSzK7sI,0.3296875,2018-10-04 18:34:36,True,True

Easy enough, but, unbeknownst to Earl, he's just signed on as a drug courier for a Mexican cartel. He does well -- so well, in fact, that his cargo increases exponentially, and Earl is assigned a handler. But he isn't the only one keeping tabs on Earl; the mysterious new drug mule has also hit the radar of hard-charging DEA agent Colin Bates. And even as his money problems become a thing of the past, Earl's past mistakes start to weigh heavily on him, and it's uncertain if he'll have time to right those wrongs before law enforcement, or the cartel's enforcers, catch up to him.""

This was told to me by the tour guide when I went for the Warner Bros Studio tour in LA.  John Travolta was shooting for a movie in the studios and he was addicted to playing basketball so he asked the studio head if he could get a basketball court set up in a vacant spot on the  premises. The studio head who was totally against the idea asked Travolta to get 200 signatures of producers and he would allow it. John took  went to Clint Eastwood's office and got his signature on a piece of paper. He took the piece of paper and went to the studio head who ordered the immediate set up of the basketball court.,1,0,chaoticdays,N_QksSzK7sI,0.10999999999999999,2018-12-13 16:08:22,False,True

2018-12-20T02:20:36,"Many critics might come forward for Clint Eastwood doing such a movie as this and although I have always been a fan of Eastwood, in truth within this movie...I can relate to it. After being forced into retirement at age 63 because after being laid off, no one would hire me because of my age and so I took and early retirement....And that was hard! My wife was on a disability from a bungled back surgery leaving her in excruciating pain thereof. She became addicted to pain pills so we remained together for 22 years with her addiction problem that eventually ruined the marriage. Lucky we had no children. But a little over four years ago, she unknowingly left me when I went to visit my family over the weekend. She took a majority of our retirement fund which wasn't much, and many other things that left me with bills and a mortgage that I was barely able to pay because of my meager Social Security. I was nearly in foreclosure on my home, losing her income and with no senior housing or apartment living available, I was looking at living on the streets in my old age. I am now 70 years old, she passed away last February from ALS and I am still struggling financially trying to remain in my home. And I will tell you this....when this came upon me this sudden, I was scared out of my mind, dealing with depression, anxiety and you name it that I was near suicidal that I ended up in a mental hospital for a time. You never know what a person will do when his livelihood is threatened, you are about to lose everything life offered you in your younger days and now you are old, alone and lonely without a rational way of viewing life. A person gets desperate in times like this because all you have on your mind is how to survive. I suppose if an opportunity came along to run drugs at the time I was in this desperate and depressed state....I could have very easily done the same thing as this character Clint Eastwood played. I was frightened and desperate more-so than I was ever before in my life!! The only thing I had to get me through was my mother passed on just before she left, but she owned a few acres of wheat land she inherited but could not be sold as it was still on a two year lease. Once the lease was over my family sold this acreage.....That is the only thing I had to help me through this crises. If that would have not been the case....I was very close to ending it all....So, when old age hits hard and you are about to lose it all....a person can get so desperate it is no telling what he is capable of doing!!",412,31,George Foryan,N_QksSzK7sI,-0.027063953488372098,2018-12-20 02:20:36,False,True

After hearing such wonderful things about his mule, the cartel boss decides he wants to meet his prized mule. A meeting is arranged, a party is contrived and Earl Stone is treated like a king. During the party, the cartel boss seeking to take care of his mule arranges for two significantly younger and very attractive women to have sex with him. What follows is one of the most cringest scenes I have ever seen as we are greeted to Clint Eastwood stripping himself half naked in front of these two women. While the woman have bodies that impress, Mr. Eastwood, for lack of better words, looks like shit. If that was not enough, one of the females straddles Mr. Eastwood and the light goes out and that is the scene.  I loved the movie up until that point. But that scene killed it for me and made me dislike the entire movie.

2019-01-29T08:00:53,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. There must be something in the tap water if people think this even passes as a mediocre film. It was an absolute chore to sit through. Boring, predictable and hardly any action, which would be fine if the story made up for it... but it doesn't. Infact, it's kind of like a bad action movie except it has no action. You get the worst of both worlds.  Eastwood plays the only mildly interesting character, the rest are all flat, cliche, forgettable or unlikable. There is almost zero tension throughout the entire film. Not once did I fear for Eastwood's character, excluding that brief moment with the dog shown in this trailer.  I'll keep this spoiler free, but there are plot threads that are never tied up, character arcs that don't conclude and a death scene that is supposed to be a tear jerker that ends up being unintentionally hilarious.  It also feels like the most drawn out movie ever. They stretched what could have been a short film into a two hour snoozefest. I was ecstatic to leave the theater. Whoever edited it needs to be fired, they could have cut half the film and nothing would be missed.   This is Eastwood's worst movie by far, it shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence as his other work unless you are talking about how bad it is compared to them.

2019-05-15T05:11:34,"Damn good movie....  lots of spoilers ahead just watched it.  and these are my thoughts as bewildering as they are, be thankful they are clearly written and you dont have to decipher them like I do! As I process them XD  Sadly I would only rate it 7 or 8 stars our of 10.   Mainly due to the fact they never really closed the story on all the loose ends, we never see what happens to julio who I would have expected to leave the cartel after his adopted father was killed and kinda saw the old man as a father figure.  If the film would have had an extra 30 min and a change of an ending to have earl tip off the DEA agent at the waffle house to try and save julio I think the story could have taken a different turn.   Id have written  earl as martyr and had him die at the end by one of the cartel members during a big sting on the mansion taking down the new king pin saving julio from a future demise.  Julio had a good heart and could have benefited from this story change having earl come in and meet the new boss after his final delivery.   They said they were going to kill him afterwards anyways so instead of having him kill the last two henchman id have had him deliver the drugs on the DEA's instructions to go for the bigger bust the big boss take down. For agreeing to help the DEA they would have promised to help julio if possible and help him relocate under protection if he would be willing to testify in court, which he would have turned on the new boss easily given the chance and defiantly if earl would have encouraged it after his adoptive father was killed.  So during this final climax of events earl would have died in the chaos of the DEA bust of the mansion.   Prob by the boss himself or another cartel member acting on the orders of the big guy while they were dealing with the agents swarming the property inevitably leading to the capture or death of the new boss, and the arrest and protection of julio.  now earl and julio might not have been as close as family but earl was quite a caring guy towards the end saving the VFW  and helping a few people with his drug money.   I wouldnt have put it past his character to go a bit further and try and save julio from the new boss after learning he had been replaced and julio was now under a tighter leash just like himself.  I could have easily seen him taking this route over the other road which many have traveled which lead to his wife and family.   I still would have included those scenes of mary and the reconcile of his relationship with them but Id have not made it the ending theme bit too morbid for my taste I like bittersweet endings and I feel like this ending would have been a touch sweeter over an old man going to prison and no real drug bust taking place.  That and we would have had an actual shoot out.. now I know the ending would have been very similar to Gran Torino in some aspects but not entirely just the characters death, and many films do this kill their lead at the end nothing new... sadly its not done often enough in my own personal opinion I find it brings more emotion usually to the ending when there is death act like this.   Hopefully someone can read this and envision this ending better than the one in the film like I can and see how it could have changed everything ever so slightly.
