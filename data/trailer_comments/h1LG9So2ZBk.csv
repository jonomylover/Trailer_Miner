That being  said if you have not already read the book please then maybe then maybe my review may make more sense as shall the trailer. First may I say seeing Harrison Ford play John Thornton seems like a role he was made to play, one of three I can say and I am sure anyone can guess the other two roles. That being said, let's first talk about the book first then the trailer. John Thornton is not really a huge part of the book as a whole, but yet at the same time is. John arrives in the book fairly late however the bond between him and Buck is unmatched and so beautifully written. Now I will not go too much further into this as not to wanting to spoil it for those who have not read the book (If that is possible). Now let's discuss the narrative of the book, it is some of the best story telling I have ever seen. It comes close to another one of my top ten favorite books which is the Old Man and the Sea. Great book. I digress, this trailer holds up. Yes looks like they took some creative liberty but still remained true to the source material. Now everyone wants to pick apart the CGI dog. Ok let's think about this for a second. In the book the emotions expressions and animation they give Buck I don't think they could touch on with a trained dog. Also I don't think it looks terrible.

Buck seems too fluid and cartoony in this movie; and the trailer seems light hearted. Compared to the book, where it has a more mature and serious theme/setting. As it seems in the movie, it will show Buck and Harrison Ford's journey together; where as in the book, it's a telling of Buck just trying to survive in the world with danger lurking on every corner. The book is very violent, and harsh to all characters. Whether it be the main, side, good, or evil. No one is protected by the plot, but are rather held at the mercy of their environment. It's a pretty grounded setup. For the CGI, I think they just could've have a real dog act where the scenes are quite and calm, and then switch to animation when there is action, similar to lady and the tramp remake. But still have its animation be stiff, lacking in emotional facial expressions for grounded reality. This movie will probably be at least ok, and I at least hope that this will get people interested in the book.",0,0,Mosey_around,h1LG9So2ZBk,0.021626984126984133,2019-11-21 06:22:51,True,True

Buck gets kidnapped and forced through several people starting with the man in the red sweater who violently beats him with a club. Buck goes through hardships with both man and dogs.    This movie in my opinion looks good as it's own story. But trying to pass it off as a movie adaptation of one of the best books of all time  is a poor choice on the directors half.

So maybe this is their way to respect the wild and maybe that's why Harrison Ford agreed. I know the CGI seems annoying but maybe we should watch the movie and then judge wether it's good or bad?
