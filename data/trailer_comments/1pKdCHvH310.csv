After nearly half a year, I had given up hope. I was thinking he had probably gotten run over by a truck or attacked by wild animals. When Christmas came, I honestly didn't care, all I wanted was for Jax to come home, and usually Christmas was my favorite holiday, but during Christmas Day, while I was taking out the trash in the morning. I heard a familiar bark, when I turned around I saw Jax. He was staring at me, we both stared until Jax leapt on me, shoving me in the snow and hugging me. I hugged him, crying, so happy to see Jax after nearly a year. When I showed my dad he was so glad. All I know is, Jax and me have a unbreakable bond. And no distance can break what we have.

2018-12-29T19:03:13,My dog got lost one time in a snow blizzard with our babysitters dog and they were gone for hours im personily a huge dog lover so i never wanted to stop searching. He was gone for at least 5 hours when he came back with our babysitters dog  our babysitters dog (lily) did not have a collar so we were scared for her to. Our dog (tucker) and lily came back together  that means they stuck together and stayed by each others side to find their way back home the scary thing was we searched everywhere in our neighborhood streets around us and everyone within 1 mile of our house and he wasnt there so the fact that they stayed together and made it home safely just goes to show you how reliable they are and however fun their having if you treat them well they will always come back to you they try to have fun but they try most of all to stick with the pack,4,0,Chris Stopp,1pKdCHvH310,0.10909090909090911,2018-12-29 19:03:13,True,True

Oh and since when are all the Denver police women??? I saw maybe 6 different police, all women and of course, as usually, Hollywood makes them out to be Gestapo-like characters.  Not a good movie to watch. My 12 year old is an avid animal lover and she thought it was ridiculous without anything believable at all.  Second night after it opened tells the story- 6 people in the theater including the 2 of us.  Just another in the long list of Hollywood flops. Seemed like they covered all the regular Hollywood propaganda garbage though,  all the white men were bad except the gay black and white  couple, which turned my daughter off. Now that I think about it, every white male in the movie was portrayed as a bad guy. The ensemble is complete.  Anything Bruce Cameron and Judd is off our go-to list, which these days is getting quite long. More Communist Chinese money down the drain.

But believe me you have NOT seen anything near the entire movie in this short trailer.  A great deal happens in the film that is not even hinted at in the trailer.

2019-08-03T12:57:30,"Let me share a real story about a dog's way home.   I used to live in the Himalayas. It was a dense forest region and we used to live in the last house of that settlement as tenants. Our landlords were contractors and they lived in the adjacent house. They had an Indian breed dog named Moti. Moti was a really goofy dog. He was naughty and always ready to run out of the house.  The old grand dad of the house had a love hate relationship with him. He told us that they had another dog named Moti who was really brave and he would not let any wild animal come inside the premises. He died and they got this new dog and named him Moti too, but he was not even half as brave as him.    One day they got really annoyed with him and decided to give him to someone else. Moti's new family lived like 50 km away from our house. It was a totally different place. Our landlord's wife soon got very sad. She started missing Moti. Like how he would always be around, asking for treats. One day they got a call that Moti ran away from his new home. They felt really sad. It was a dense forest region and wild bears and panthers were a real threat. Everyone thought that Moti must have died in the forest. After a few days, they saw a worker of theirs (landlord was contractor) carrying the dog to their house. Everyone was really shocked. The worker told them that he was at this intersection (around 5 km from their house. A major intersection) and moti came to him and started wagging his tail. Moti recognised this worker as he had seen him come to the house occasionally.  So the worker brought him to their home.    Our moti travelled 45 km to the intersection on his own. No one knows how he got there. It wasn't really a single road from start to end. They decided to keep him and grand dad knows this moti is as courageous as the last one. :)",210,9,Sahil Patel,1pKdCHvH310,0.07371243952126307,2019-08-03 12:57:30,False,False
