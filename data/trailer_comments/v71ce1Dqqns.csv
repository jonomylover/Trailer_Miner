A couple of blocks away from my apartment I saw smoke rise behind some buildings and I was sure it was my apartment. As I arrived I saw around fifteen firemen standing outside my apartment complex. I have to be honest. I am not necessarily worried about my scorched apartment, but rather the police finding the chopped up bodies I stored in the freezer so I could have meat for the upcoming apocalypse.
