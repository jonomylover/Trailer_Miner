2015-11-19T01:07:17,Prediction Time:  1.) The film will try to one-up the last one's big reveal by having a reveal that Freeman's character is a magician and that he let himself get caught as a misdirection.  2.) Daniel Radcliffe has a minor role in the film a brief cameo perhaps. Given how marketing works it wouldn't surprise me if the bit in the trailer is from the end of the film.

I think Penn and Teller have the best act because they do a magic trick, show you how it was done and then do the same trick with a twist which violates every logic that was presented in their original explanation of the trick to keep it fun. There is an old movie called Houdini starring Tony Curtis that was fun. It captured the story behind Houdini and shows how some of his tricks were performed. So with the exception of Houdini (the movie), my personal opinion is that movies about magic should not be made. In a movie with editing and special effects, anything can be done.
