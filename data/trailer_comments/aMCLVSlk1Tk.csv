And it just so happens Michael murders John purposely on Laurie Strodes birthday as a way to send her a warning . His murder goes unsolved . 7 years later now in 2018 , Laurie has taken heed and knows very well it was Michael who committed the murder of her son and ever since then has moved backed to Illinois to a neighborhood adjacent to Haddonfeild to prepare for 1 final fight to the death .

2018-06-09T19:58:46,"I'm sure this will be awesome and it has some cool moments here in the Trailer. I didn't realize that it wasn't just ignoring the entire Film Series, but it's ignoring Halloween II (1981), and saying he just killed the 3 teenagers from Halloween (1978) and was then captured and has been held for 40 years; what the hell? Now they have actually rewritten the Original Film (because he was never captured)?   Also, as horrific it would be to have some maniac kill 3 teenagers, it wouldn't be anything after 40 years. If they made a sequel to Halloween & Halloween II, in which he killed at least 12 to 15 people, in multiple locations, that would be a huge thing (National News) and having him be captured at the end (sorta like how Halloween 4 started), that would work and make sense.   I'll watch the film and enjoy it, but it's just so strange, their both around 60 in the film, that right there is crazy; because they are showing he's a normal guy, so he's not some enigma that's survived multiple deaths.   I'll say again and again, I hate when Films just dismiss entire Franchises, that's just lazy, I want to see things end; I've seen every single Halloween film, and now, with this film, it was just a waste of time, because this film is saying those never happened (hell, Laurie's dead, she died at the beginning of Halloween: Resurrection). I want an actual ending to the Halloween Series, and the Friday the 13th Series, and Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and so on; I want ending, a Final Chapter.
