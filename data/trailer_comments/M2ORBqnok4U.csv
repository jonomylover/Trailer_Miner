This song begins playing as we see Dany from the back walking toward the doors to the throne room. She is dressed in black and as the sweet part of this song is playing, we see all the flashes her story so far where she has been a hero. As she climbs the steps to the throne room doors and the music is building, we see rose vines, wolf paws, tentacles, lion tail, stag hooves, etc..all behind her. As she approaches the door and the music becomes quiet, the “animals” behind her stop. We see a quick flash of all the people she has lost and a tear hit the ground. Her innocence is gone. The doors open and we see the dark queen enter the throne room as the music turns dark. She begins her walk to the iron throne and we hear an intercut of all the characters discussing Targaryen madness. She climbs the steps to the throne and turns around. The music stops. All the other animals have entered the throne room. The music fades back in at the very end just as we see Dany turn around in front of the throne and open her eyes. We see the eyes of a dragon and the screen fades to black.   This is the vision I got while hearing this song.

2020-04-22T03:33:00,"Okay here’s the scene in my head:     The year is 2650, we are on a fantasy world where humans are  the most vile race, unlike the demons, dwarfs, elfs, beastmen and dragons (strongest race) humans reproduce extremely fast. All the races lived in peace but humans started emptying all the food storages and ressources accessible thus bringing chaos and war. The war lasted from 2020 all the way to 2600. The humans who remained dominant the whole time are still roaming and ravaging the earth while the other races were all forced into slavery. The humans were basically tyrants and had always brought chaos but the other races were very kind and helped them without hesitation until the war began. The dragon race has gone instinct, none was left (or so they say), all the other races kings (the leader and strongest figure of each race) were publicly executed, all but the dragon king. No one had seen him in the past 2 thousand years, when the humans appeared and began their pillaging. He has been long forgotten by most people but those who remember know that nothing, absolutely nothing could stand in his way, he was basically a god. A god that brought peace, was kind, he treasured the peace and equality between all the races more than anything. Sadly, he went into a deep slumber a century after the appearance of humans, just before he could realize how horrible creatures they were, he despised them.           Now, begin the song, cause this is the scene I see when I listen.   (Timestamp 0:00)  But then, the year 2650, the dragon king WAKES UP. He slowly goes out of his cave hoping to see the same green, blue and lively scenery he saw 2000 years ago. But all he sees is a dead land, dried up, no more rivers, the trees were removed and not even the animals carcass are left. He proceeds to use his powers to go sightseeing the surrounding and sees a human city where thousands of beastmen and elves and chained and bleeding while digging in an iron mine.        Nows the part of the song thats right before the DROP.     (Timestamp 1:10)  A tear rolls on his scaly skin, he wonders “ What happened, why are they all suffering, the land is dry, the birds stopped chirping, the rivers stopped flowing, all the other races went silent and the dragons... are dead, what caused all this, who did this? At this moment, it suddenly makes sense. THE HUMANS!        Now is the drop.        (Timestamp 1:25)  Enraged, he dosen’t move, he just lets out all of his aura and his rage at once. The shock is felt by every single being, everyone falls to their knees unable to move, as if they had mountain on their shoulders, just from releasing the powers he gives off, the world stopped moving and the humans then realize “ The Dragon King woke up” He lets out a roar (timestamp 2:18), and only from the sound, everything in a 100 miles radius (mountains included) is oblirated.  And then, every single human thinks of the same words “What have we done”.
