For anyone who doesn't know bruce lee and is watching this movie, please do some good research to get a better understanding of who he was.

To make a bio of such a legend and add traditional Kung fu film fighting sequences-Where the hero beats up 10 plus baddies-is quite frankly very poor.  Yes Bruce added some traditional Chinese movie artistic moves in his early films which were highly unrealistic, but they were early days, his becoming a recognized actor in that field. Later he choreographed actual real life fighting techniques into his film sequences.   Portraying an actor taking on multiple people in a film is one thing, depicting a Bio of Bruce doing  it in real life to make a film is another, he never. I find it an insult to him that a movie maker would portray him in this way.  If your going to make a film, a bio, of his life, then start at the beginning. Make a real life story of his life, not just a film where you can make money of the back of a name, which is all these films have ever done since his death.
