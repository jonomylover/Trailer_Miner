Granted, I haven't watched it yet, but this trailer is all about Pac being a gangster rapper. Which he wasn't! There's nothing mentioned about his past! Growing up in Baltimore, being a son of a Black Panther, actually being born in prison! Nothing about 	Lesane Parish Crooks, Pac's real name. He went to a performance arts high school and studied ballet at one point. This movie isn't a story about the man that you didn't see, it's a gimmick to make money from his name and his death. Both Pac and Afeni Shakur will be rolling over in their graves when this comes out! If you want the real story, check out Tupac: Resserection the documentary and pick up ""Holler If You Hear Me"" by Eric Michael Dyson. When Pac was alive, they wanted us to think that he was just a gangster rapper. That's how they made money from him! But he was more, way way more than that!!!!!!
