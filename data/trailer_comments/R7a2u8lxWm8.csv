Night of the Living Dead, guess who would have been the sole survivor had he not been mistaken for a zombie after the others had all died?   The sequel to that film, Dawn of the Dead killed half of the main characters and left the other half on an unresolved cliffhanger.  Guess who they were?  Friday the Thirteenth part ii had no less than THREE allegedly expendable characters who ultimately escaped Jason's wrath.   The original Independence Day had one air force man survive the massacre, and it wasn't Harry Connick JR.   What compels people to desperately cling to cliches that were never all that relevant in the first place, and even less so now?  Are they that determined to look stupid or nitpicky?
