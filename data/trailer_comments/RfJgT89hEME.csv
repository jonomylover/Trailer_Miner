I've got a lot of friends from space. These aliens can come here, but they gotta come here legally. Oh and we will make Mexico pay for the space wall too. All 400 million square miles of surface area. Hillary Clinton: At this point, what difference does it make? If we give them Obama or Sanders maybe they'll leave. Bernie Sanders: Humans don't know what it's like to be alien, which is why we need at least 50% of the US government to be alien. It's only fair for what we did to the aliens in 1996. Ted Cruz: Are we, as a nation, just going to let these evil aliens invade? Of course not. But I think that Russia is the far bigger issue here. We can put the alien issue off the plate for at least a decade, I'm sure they'll wait. John Kasich: I will be elected through totally democratic and legitimate means, I promise.

If a ship as large as this alien one came anywhere near earth, it would  radically alter not only the spin, but the velocity, and trajectory of earths orbit to the point of catastrophic no return. In reality the subsequent alien air and ground forces in this kind of scenario would not serve the aliens at all. They would only have to, either, bombard us to hell from outside the orbit of the moon, (which they'd be more than capable of), or just come near enough to earth to alter it and the moons orbit, then fly away and await our quick, and inevitable demise. While I will watch it and most likely enjoy it, it's sad they'd toss out the reality of physics, as well as, any notion of alien strategy or capability, for nothing but an action orgy. There is, absolutely, no sound reason these aliens would come in with fists flying in a blind frenzy of hate and revenge, and destruction, tossing out all reason, when they would not even have to so much as scuff a boot, or break a nail to get what they want from us.

When I first heard that Will Smith declined coming back for this sequel I was disappointed and annoyed. Annoyed that he would skip the sequel to the movie that made him a star, but... now that I've seen this travesty, I understand why he said no. This is a generic, typical action flick of the early 2000s ala Armageddon and Pearl Harbor, Volcano, etc... Movies that are so bad they are laughable. I waited to see this at home because I did not want to waste money on a theater viewing. Now I have wasted more than money, I have wasted 90 minutes of my life. Yes, only 90 minutes because I cannot finish it. It is such a bad movie that I had to stop my viewing and write this to deal with the frustration of how bad a movie it truly is.

I can appreciate as an age-contemporary of so many of the principal actors their contributions to Independence Day: Resurgence. So, as the successor to Independence Day this movie, glossier and more full-bodied, works for me. Judd Hirsch (""That's my David!"") does not seem to have aged a day from the original and I am so glad to see him in a pivotal role with the edge of sly, comic relief in his character. William Fichtner, as he always does, elevates this film by his capable presence; see also Mr. Fichtner's performance as the thoughtful Delta operator in Black Hawk Down. One more example of a fine performance (of so many in this movie) is Maika Monroe as she seethes, convincingly, with emotion when her character's father, President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) goes forth to secure Earth for future generations against the hordes of marauding aliens.  I like this movie very much. New heroes, new thrills and a cast of thousands; what's not to like?
