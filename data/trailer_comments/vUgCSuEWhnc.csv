Not knowing what to do she stands there watching the fire get bigger, hotter and more intense... shes frozen by fear. The fire is now raging and the little girl choked by smoke gets snapped from her catatonic state and runs from the house as she hears the faint screaming of her once happy , new family. After several minutes pass a neighbor notices the engulfed house and calls 911, but its too late. The entire family- save for the girl- dies in the fire. The little girl becaomes a mute, and never fully recovers from that night. She grows older, becoming less involved with psychiatrists and more involved with drugs. She soon becomes a full blown addict and prostitute. Its now been 15 years since that fateful night, the night she murdered her family, and on this night she too found death from an overdose and with that, she reunites with the family she destroyed....
