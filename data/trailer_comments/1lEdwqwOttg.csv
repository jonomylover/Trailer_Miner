The fact that so many people (a disturbing number of which are actually NOT morons) support and legitimately enjoy them is troubling to me.     Media is powerful and popular films do have an effect on our lives as people tend to emulate what they see and absorb the lessons inherent in storytelling. Maybe we have a spoiled rich wannabe dictator in the white house because so many people in America have been worshiping billionaires who beat up street criminals and ""heroes"" who possess incredible power they didn't have to earn.     And as far as the title goes, ""nightcrawler"" is a slang term for news stringers; the profession that Gyllenhaal's character holds in the film. And if you didn't watch it because there are no flying robots, you missed out on one of the best films of the decade, far more interesting and thought provoking than whatever dull business the avengers are  up to.
