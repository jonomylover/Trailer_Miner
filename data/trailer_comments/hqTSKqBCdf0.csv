This movie has a happy ending but is not based on something in real life situation. Maybe I've been unlucky but rarely would you meet a lawyer that cared, I've met many.   To get to the point, not many people or the average persons in life are civil, patient or cordial. This movie shows a lot of patients which under normal life situation would not happen because it is difficult to control if you factor in once emotions. Control is an illusion. Still was a hell of a good movie. I feel Chris could have shown more a little more emotion. It bothers me that everyone was collected if only people were logical in real life.",0,0,Rinzler :.,hqTSKqBCdf0,0.12346491228070175,2017-05-12 03:58:32,False,True
