Mouths didn't move, claws flailed around like rubber, it totally pulls you out of the immersive feel of the movie. Granted it's my personal opinion that this CGI looks good and it works for me, which may not be the case for everyone.

Jackson said originally NONE of the movies would be exactly like the books because it would be impossible to fit it into a movie unless you want to a billion movies. Which I wouldn't mind but to the normal movie goer they don't want to see The Hobbit: Part 23. BTW I am a massive LOTR/Hobbit fan.  So I accept that almost all movies based on books (or anything else) aren't often accurate. Just like many don't like that Transformers (for example) aren't like the series. I don't mind. They are meant to be brainless action flicks. I'm just glad to see Transformers on a big screen no matter the changes or how cheesy the story is.¬†  Which is why I say some things in summary: 1. If you don't like it, don' see it. 2.

But god damn it, when you look at it, the CGI is just great ! I mean Erebor feels real as hell (both from inside and outside), the landscapes are stunning, it is impossible to tell wether some sets are extended with the green screen tech or not and if so, what part of the set is real and what part is fake (which is, I think, the main difference with the Star Wars prequels regarding CGI), the wide army shots look 100x times better than those from LotR, Laketown was impressive in DoS (looks even better when burning) and hell even Azog looks stuningly realistic and scary on the close-up we get from him !  So right, the CGI might be overused for characters, but for landscapes, wide shots, epic shots, set extensions... it looks sooooo great ! I'd go as far as to say that the CG version of many sets looks better and more realistic than the models we had in LotR (Laketown, one of the most realistic CG cities ever made, Rivendell looks better in AUJ then in LotR and Erebor is just stunning... Looks more realistic and has way more details than Moria !)¬†  All this to say : please guys stop complaining about CGI, it brings soo much into the movie !",3,0,Toini01,iVAgTiBrrDA,0.2438200280112045,2014-11-06 22:05:49,True,True

If nothing else, he would probably be blown away by Jackson's 20 year commitment to breathing life into those pages and The Lord of the Rings. And he would probably invite you along to enjoy the ride and ask you to reserve judgment until the end of the experience.

I feel that the movies suffered going from two to three movies, because it meant that Jackson had to come up with even more fanfiction, and fast too, which resulted in for example the dreadful Dragon vs Dwarves scenes in the last one.

And here we should have at least 500 Dwarven Warriors from Iron Hills - grim, tough, stout short dudes heavily clad in iron mail and boots. Not some merry fairies but serious, battle worn killers with heavy axes- no less than portrayed by Tolkien and he made it pretty clear that these dudes mean business. If the show will be run by the Elves again with their sneaky ninja ways and shiny, gay armor, I'm going to explode on my sit in movie theater.. Of course - I've got nothing against Elves and the battle is not what attracted me to the story, I wish there was less combat, more wandering and adventures - just like in the book. But I understand that what's cool to read may not necessarily work on the screen.

Which means they were not going to make Hobbit movies. But every fan of them was pleading for Hobbit movies and they heard us. So Peter Jackson went and made The Hobbit Trilogy. ¬† ¬†So instead of complaining that it has CGI in it and that he added a few things to it, we should all just be thankful that he even made Hobbit movies because he wasn't going to in the first place. Because all of you pleaded to him to make them. So when he actually makes them you all wine about them.  ¬†I believe true fans of The Hobbit and Tolkien's works would like The Hobbit of what it is and its beautiful story and theme. And if they add a few extra characters or if they add some CGI to some stuff, so what. It does not ruin the story in anyway. All of these complainers and what they are saying are going against everything Tolkien believed, of what he put in his stories and what he wanted for the world. ¬† The Hobbit can't be and look like The Lord of the Rings because of the 13 years or so they are separated. For me I am very excited to see this wonderful last movie.  ¬†So please, just be thankful for these wonderful movies and just enjoy what The Hobbit is and that we even got any movies at all. ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†",24,7,Wesley Miller,iVAgTiBrrDA,0.34134615384615385,2014-11-07 18:06:17,True,True

However, the likely reason for this is because people don't like feeling that they're just part of the crowd. So a person may like something like a movie, book, song, etc. Then more people start to like it. Eventually the thing gets so popular the person who originally liked it convinces them self (subconsciously) that they hate it because they want to feel that they're more of an independent thinker.

Sure, more revenue means people lose opportunities or preexisting jobs in the process, but hey, the upper class has got to be paid one way or another.

2014-11-08T00:23:51,"I wish people would stop complaining about the amount of CGI in the film or just the trailer. Yes, there is a lot of CGI, but you can't expect them not to use it for creating armies, various creatures and scenery (the city of Erebor, laketown on fire etc) without using CGI. It would be impossible. The elves do look the same if you pause the shot, they are CGI, it couldn't have hurt to get a few more actors, but it lasts about 2 seconds and elves (especially the minor elves) are known for being similar, moving together perfectly. There isn't much of a problem apart from people bothered about every. single. frame. You have to accept things can't always be real in films now, especially since this is such a long film. You have to remember it is in 3D. They can't use the non-cgi tricks from Lotr, it doesn't WORK. So cgi is now the alternative for making height differences etc. which I think works well. Also, dressing up actors in full prosthetics is very difficult for them, but PETER JACKSON TRIED IT, BUT IT DIDN'T WORK SO THEY USED MOTION CAPTURE. Many forget lots of extra content is taken out of the appendices not just the actual book of the hobbit, since many things are uneventful and unsuitable for movies.

2014-11-08T01:50:30,"I for one have loved both films so far and am really looking forward to this one. Yes, Jackson turned a relatively short book in to three films. He also added a lot of stuff from the appendices, which I think is a huge improvement. Gandalf just saying 'well, I'm off' like he did in the book would be absolutely terrible. Legolas being in the films is just a logical thing. The love triangle I could do without, but I actually liked Tauriel's character. The dwarves are recognisable, and not just because of different colours of hats. Fighting Smaug might have been lengthy and not in the book, but it was entertaining enough for me. And at least we get to see things such as the White Council, the Ring having an influence on Bilbo, Gandalf's reasons for joining the quest. One of the main flaws of the book was introducing Bard at the exact time he was needed. So yes, I liked the Esgaroth politics, they clearly served a purpose. The barrel scene was just absolutely amazing. So yes, I actually like most changes Jackson has made to the Hobbit and practically all changes he made to The Lord of the Rings.

I love his movies and for those who say that it spoils the book (by the way, I've read it too many times and I like it), I say:  The book and the film - incomparable things. When shooting movies always have to make any changes. Always. And more so, the film - it's not a literal retelling of the book. This is her adaptation. I do not deny that they have bad points, but the changes that have been made in ""The Hobbit"" for the most part for the better, in my opinion.  I like both books and movies.

Even in the book his presence before the battle begins only makes things worse - Thorin quite clearly tells Bard that he will not barter in the presence of his enemy so come back the next day without the elves and then they will negotiate reparations for the people of lake-town. Bard and Thranduil refuse so Thorin turns them away.

Jackson takes into movie parts that weren't in the Hobbit book, like White Council, Dol Guldur, Sauron etc. because it happened in pretty much same time as a standard Hobbit plot, which Tolkien puts in other books. That is why it is 9 hours of movies. If PJ would just do exactly what The Hobbit book contains we would have movie for 10 yrs old, let's face it. This book is good, it is pleasant to read but it is not even close to lotr trilogy, as Tolkien was aware, yet Jackson managed to make it a very good prequel for lotr. He obviously changes some facts, as he did in lotr (or just throwing them away) but in my opinion it is healthy for the movie. He made lotr much more dynamic than book really is. He had to miss some parts, but the choices were very good e.g. Bombadil - it would take a lot of time, yet brings nothing to the plot. Sometimes he even manages to express things better than even Tolkien did e.g. when Theoden gets healed by Gandalf - that is just pure genius depsite being totally out of the book. The point is that he made the Hobbit much better that it could have been if someone made exactly as the book says and as a Tolkien fan I personally love it. My only problem is the way Gandalf is made - he is pretty much as powerful as Sauron, and deifnitely not less than Saruman, yet he seems like just an old guy who gets knocked everytime he is facing a real enemy. Even Galadriel looks superior to him, even though he is - as Maya - a higher level of being. Tolkien made him humble though so probably that's what Jackson is doing, but in my opinion he exaggerates a lot",0,0,Piotr K,iVAgTiBrrDA,0.25108751608751606,2014-11-08 14:33:29,True,True

2014-11-08T19:23:17,"Why is it that every director feels the need to mutilate a great story when adapting it to film? I understand most (not all) of the changes made to the LOTR trilogy, but this? So many unnecessary changes and additions that it warps the original story almost beyond recognition. The hobbit (and the LOTR trilogy) was more than just a story, it was THE story. Tolkien poured most of his life into them and created a world so rich and vast that I don't think anyone will ever surpass it. These movies in my opinion shit all over his work. Initially I was really excited when I heard Jackson wanted to include some elements from the Appendices and other works, but as soon as I watched the first movie I knew it was just a cash cow. These films reek of Hollywood, which to me is a huge disappointment as these stories have been a big part of me for a long time. Adding characters that didn't exist or were supposed to be dead, altering characters personalities, creating ridiculous love triangles, unnecessary action sequences, rushed character development (Bilbo), inaccurate portrayal of characters (Thorin is supposed to be really old, but instead got the Hollywood ""pretty boy"" makeover), and over the top special effects that make it look like I'm playing a video game. On top of that, it really fails to capture the feel of middle earth which is one thing I felt the LOTR trilogy did very well. I guess I could keep going but in the end I'm just ranting in the comments section on YouTube.

This movie looks awesome sure I wasn't the biggest fan of the first movie but it appears that Peter Jackson is learning from his mistakes and that the following movies are going to be better, the second movie is proof of that. Also the sets (although mostly CGI) looks pretty cool and the fight scenes look well choreographed. I like how amazing and in sync all the elves are when they draw their bows (I don't know if it's just me but it really pisses me off when something like that is done sloppily so this made me very happy). I am really excited for this and I hope that it will be as epic as the last Lord of the Rings movie.

Although it wasn't necessary, it did bring in another female character, and there aren't many of them, especially badass ones. I also love the whole Dol Guldur situation, if I remember right that didn't happen in the book. This is just my opinion.

2014-11-10T09:49:07,"Personally, as someone who has read, seen, and/or enjoyed both the book and the two film versions of The Hobbit, I think the purists who complain about the films are, for the most part, being very selfish and unreasonable. Just because the movies don't look *exactly* like *your* imagination or match the source material word-for-word, that doesn't automatically mean the movies themselves are bad. Perhaps if someone made their own indie film version of the Middle Earth stories into a niche film for esoteric fantasy-geek communities, would they be satisfied with that? I imagine it might potentially turn into an underground cult favorite, but it wouldn't be nearly as successful as the current film adaptations (by the way, the films were created by an independent film studio, but they were fashioned to appeal to many different people, not just the readers who were already familiar with the stories. This allows non-readers and newcomers to discover the series as well as readers to enjoy the film, and all-in-all, I think the result has been largely positive.) Honestly, I don't think a lot of fans realise just how good this series has it: The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, if they were in the hands of another director and studio, would have probably suffered the same fate as the Dune series (wonderful books, but mediocre film), and that's just one example of a possible alternative outcome. Some people are so busy picking apart the films for perceived negatives that they miss all the *good* things about the films. I myself take a more positive approach; instead of crying about every single detail that might be missing or changed, I like to either enjoy the books and films as separate stories, or enjoy each version as supplementary to one another. For example, the book is perfect the way it is, but the movies give each dwarf his own unique personality, and that to me adds more intrigue and layers to the story. Sure, the addition of Tauriel as Kili's romantic interest may not have been entirely necessary (and probably somewhat cliche as well), but I don't mind it personally, since it doesn't take away too much from the overall big picture, and I think it's kind of cute -- and yes, I do care enough about the series to be interested in what happens between them in the film. I won't give any spoilers here, but I am curious, not just about Tauriel and Kili, but also about the roles that Galadriel, Saruman, and Elrond will play in the movie, and of course, I want to see how the rest of the story will unfold on screen, because for me, making comparisons between the films and the book is actually fun and interesting. For that, I am very excited about the third film. I agree that, most times, books or source materials are better than the adaptations, but there are occasions when I actually prefer the adaptation over the source material (Forest Gump being one example), and sometimes, the adaptation is nearly equal in quality to the original,  but of course, that's for each individual to decide. As for myself, The Hobbit films are one of the most accurate adaptations to a book that I've ever seen, I mean, almost every event in the book was captured on film, and I for one happen to find that impressive.  People need to understand that books and films are very different mediums, and adaptations of either one will never match the source material 100%; Only in a perfect world would that ever happen. That being said -- especially compared to most adaptive interpretations -- the Peter Jackson adaptation to The Hobbit is actually *very* spot-on in it's accuracy of the plot and the atmosphere described in Tolkien's work, even with the added embellishments to the story (which, in my opinion, don't take away too much from the plot, especially since most of the embellishments are based on actual elements of the whole Middle Earth universe.)  As far as purists being selfish, well, the fact that they act as if the films were made *just* to cater to them is pretty self-centered, and they talk as if the differences between the pages and the film are somehow a personal attack against them or the author. I completely understand and agree with respecting the author's work, but in my opinion., the anti-film critics/fanatics are taking it too far. Some of the same people who complain about the films are probably the same ones who have been demanding a film adaptation for years, but when they finally get one, they just nit-pick and complain about the smallest details (sounds pretty ungrateful to me.) On top of that, some fans act high-and-mighty just because they prefer the books and hate the movies, and that's just pretentious and arrogant. There's just no pleasing some people, unfortunately...  Anyway, if you happen to be a person who personally didn't care for the films, then that's fine, because no one is forcing you to like the movies, and you can just stick with the books if you want. However, it's unreasonable, and childish even, to bemoan every little detail about the film and ruin the cinematic experience for others just because it didn't fit your exact expectations. I also get the impression that people compare the LotR trilogy films with the Hobbit films and expect them to look and sound exactly alike. Newsflash: The Hobbit was originally a children's book, and the tone of the book was more lighthearted and whimsical compared to the Lord of The Rings trilogy, even in book form, so would it not make sense that the Hobbit films would be more comical or whimsical as well? Also, the addition of comic relief in a film does not mean that the whole movie is crass, crude, or juvenile, and the comedy wasn't overdone either -- without it, the filmwould have been much too dark and solemn compared to the source material. I think people who believe that the film is terrible just because some parts of the movie happen to be comical are taking the story too seriously. Even Tolkien's sense of humor wasn't that dry or solemn... Besides, dwarves aren't supposed to be 'elegant' or 'polite', otherwise, they would look more like the elves! If all you got out of the Hobbit films were ""burp jokes,"" then you've missed the point of the story entirely...  Also ridiculous is when fans complain, ""There's too much CGI!"" Obviously, some films overuse CGI and make it into a spectacle in itself, but that is not the case with the LotR and Hobbit films; the CGI is simply a special effect that enhances the visual storytelling. There's nothing inherently 'evil' about it. It is a tool, nothing more. Honestly, most people have no idea how difficult or painstaking it was to create realistic-looking visual effects without modern CGI or digital enhancement, and the advancement of digital/CGI technology would progress even more slowly if people like Peter Jackson did not push the limits of special effects. In fact, without the CGI, the films would be unrecognizable, and as a result of technological limitations, even *more* scenes would have to be cut out of the film, because the action or scenery would not be practically feasible! The Peter Jackson adaptations happen to make great use of practical effects -- the prosthetics, lighting, and make-up are excellent, and the miniatures, costumes, and sets are complex in craftsmanship, and they even filmed on location with beautiful landscapes as the backdrop! But practical effects can only go so far when filming a fantasy or science fiction of this magnitude (even Star Wars was produced with homemade computers to generate some of the special effects.) Not only that, but a project of this size would mean that if every single aspect of the film relied heavily on practical effects (with little to no digital or CGI enhancement), the budget would have to be astronomical to provide for all material tools. Without high-quality computer/digital enhancements, the films would look more like a BBC special instead of a grandiose cinematic adaptation, and to be honest, I think I would be a little more disappointed in the former option. The argument that the film has ""too much CGI"" happens to be a very subjective one, but then again, whether someone enjoys the films or the books is, in the end, subjective in itself. And honestly, who could say anything unfavorable about the soundtrack? The music to the films are a lovely addition to the immersive fantasy epic, and it truly captures the magic of Middle Earth! [Okay, I can understand why some people weren't exactly pleased with the addition of Ed Sheeran's ""I See Fire"" for the end credits, but I don't think the song is that bad, and the song or artist choice could have been a lot worse, to be honest.]  How would J.R.R. Tolkien feel about the films? Well, no one can know for sure, since he has been deceased for decades, but as far as I can tell from biographies about him (and his reaction to a theatrical version of The Hobbit), I think that he would have been largely impressed. Sure, he would have frowned at some of the embellishments or changes to the plot or story, but I'm also convinced that all other aspects of the film would have amazed him greatly, and he would be pleased at how closely the films capture the magic of the epic story and the atmosphere. For example, prior adaptations of his work have interpreted the dwarves as garden gnome-like creatures, but the films more closely represent the rough-and-tough fighters that the dwarves were described as being in the Middle Earth universe. Also, prior adaptations have greatly simplified the plot of The Hobbit, whereas the film trilogy was able to tell the whole story, with room for embellishment, and a greater connection to the rest of the Middle Earth universe! [Most notably, the Rankin-Bass 1977 animation left out and changed many aspects of the story, not to mention that this version essentially killed off even more of the dwarves than the book itself! And in this version, the elves looked more like imps instead of the elegant, regal, and powerful people described in Tolkien's work and the Wingnut films. In some respects, the animated version was more accurate to the book, but for the most part, it was a rather simplistic, and arguably darker retelling of the story.] Personally, I like to think of it in much the same way as a folk tale or piece of mythology: with each storyteller, the story changes little by little, and I like to think that's what happened here. I like to think that the people at Wingnut Films studio were as faithful to the book and its respective fictional universe as any large-scale film adaptation could get. Anyway, I just think that a lot of fans could save themselves from unneeded stress if they would lighten up a bit and assess things more logically and with an open mind. If you didn't like the movies, that's fine and you are entitled to your own opinion, but that's no reason to try to ruin it for others. Regardless, I'll be enjoying the books *and* the films whether certain people like it or not. Life is too short to spend it on irrational bitterness and negativity. I think the films are great the way they are, and as much as I respect and admire Tolkien's work, I don't think I could have done it any better justice if I were a film director. I'm just grateful that someone has beautifully rendered a film series that has brought to life on the big-screen such awe-inspiring, legendary epics that will continue to inspire generations to come.  If someone told me that they didn't like the movie after watching it, I wouldn't freak out or insult them, or say things like, ""You're just an ignoramus who doesn't appreciate good cinema!"" What I would do instead is ask them, ""Really? What is it about the film that you didn't like?"" and depending on their answer, I would decide for myself if their reasons are valid or informed. If, for example, they explain specific things that displeased them, then their personal interpretation holds more support and I would respect their opinion even if I disagree. But, if their answer is more like, ""It was crap! Pure garbage! Nothing like the book at all! Peter Jackson should die!"" well then of course, I'm less likely to take their opinion seriously.  My theory is that many fans, especially those who hold a lot of nostalgia for the book, are stuck in their own interpretation of the story, and as a result, they are unable to enjoy someone else's interpretation, no matter how technically well-done it may be. When someone goes into something with strong expectations rooted firmly in their own imagination, then that's a recipe for disappointment. Speaking for myself, though, I enjoy both book and film for what they are, and I personally find that the film does justice to the book very well. That's the thing about books though: everyone has their own interpretation. Even movies from original screenplays are open to a wide diversity of interpretation and opinion (especially when remakes/reboots are involved.) As I've stated before, if you don't particularly enjoy the films, that's *okay*, because we don't all have to like the same thing, but there's hardly any reason to be so negative or defensive about it. *If you like it, great! If not, that's fine too!* Just don't act like a pretentious snob or a rude jerk about your opinion, because the attitude really isn't necessary. In the end, whether or not someone appreciates or enjoys the films is a subjective matter, but at least try to have some informed logic or reason behind your opinion. That's all I'm saying.  Ah, but maybe my approach might be a bit too academic or scholarly to be realistic. Only in a perfect world would everyone express their opinion in an informed, mature, and civilized manner. Oh well, at least I can say that I've tried to be sensible on a subjective topic...  If you've made it to the end of my essay, then I thank you for your patience and attention. Hopefully, I've said enough to support my own opinion here.¬†¬†",5,0,aliensamuraipirate,iVAgTiBrrDA,0.17890871863841765,2014-11-10 09:49:07,True,True

2014-11-11T01:36:15,"The biggest problem people fail to see in movie directing/writing a story is that every story, regardless of what it is about or what it is going to be, needs an antagonist and a protagonist. In the book, everything fits perfectly, and is really well done. But to directly transfer it from a book to a movie wouldn't make a lot of sense. First off, there wouldn't be much excitement, it'd be mainly conversational scenes and such, and two, there isn't much of an antagonist until they get to the lonely mountain to Smaug. I get that ""Holy shit, this isn't the fucking movie! This isn't what happened in the book, this movie fucking sucks!"" It irks me too, and I'm a huge LOTR fan. But in terms of an audience, and appealing to audiences who have never read the Hobbit as well, it needs to be entertaining. It at least keeps your attention and doesn't bore you to death, and that's what a movie should do. A movie that is just downright laughable, (opinionated) most don't have the motivation to keep watching because it lacks intrigue.  Peter Jackson took a lot of these ""extra"" things from the appendixes of the book and put them into the movie. I'm bantering aimlessly, but people should understand that a movie can never be perfect, and always has flaws.

Then there are movies trying to follow the book...that's kind of hard to put all that detail or sometimes lack of detail in a movie so that people watching it can follow. People have to remember that a movie is a different medium then a book. All movie makers have to be aware of their audience. There are the one who chooses what is best for the viewers who are going to watch the movie. Not the people who read it and expect that exact experience. Adapting different kind of mediums are hard enough. Don't down one because they did do what the first one did.

For example the river chase scene from DoS was absolutely asinine. A completely CG Bombur fights a dozen orcs while wearing a broken barrel as armor and wielding two axes. Bombur, an obese dwarf, then proceeds to jump into a moving barrel with PERFECT timing. I get that this is fantasy and 99% of the time I can let go, but that sequence of events hurt my brain.  Also not one of the dwarves from Thorin's crew is even half as cool as Gimli was. They're all pretty much interchangeable as far as I'm concerned. You think that during the course of three movies we'd get to know or like them more, but somehow Peter Jackson screwed that up. Instead we got a shitty love interest thing with Handsome Dwarf 1 and Elf Lady That Doesn't Exist.

2014-11-12T16:15:53,"Damn this movie looks really good. A lot better then Desolation of Smaug. I am begginig to see a pattern here, similarly with Lord of the Rings. Fellowship was a really good movie, and had it's great moments, but overall it was judged to be just good, not perfect. Two Towers had even less fans - it had it's badass moments like the first movie, but PJ really overdid it in some scenes (The scenes with Ents were boring and dragged for way too long, the elves under the helms deep was such a major change from the books that it made a lot of funs dislike the movies). The Return of the King was so epic it got a bazillion rewards including world record of oscars, and made up for the sins of two towers so much that the entire trilogy is considered timeless and great.  Hobbit was exactly the same. First movie was very decent, had it's minor mistakes, and overall was good but not perfect. Desolation had it's epic moments like the first movie, but the overuse of Legolas and Tauriel that was a major change from the book annoyed a lot of fans, and Smaug not being able to catch a bunch of dwarfs in his own house also was overdone. This movie, I think, can actually make up for the sins of Desolation and add to the already nice spotlight first movie had.

It's there, it's cheaper to use and it looks good so deal with it. As for the story changes, it's not like PJ Philippa Boynes and Fran Walsh are completely making it up as they go. It's all stuff from tolkiens mind. Also if you tried to adapt a book word for word to a film it'd make for a very boring ass book. I realize Legolas wasn't in the hobbit. But that's just cuz he wasn't mentioned. He's the damn kings son so it's entirely plausible that he'd be present for these events. Things need to be changed and cut out or added from a book for the film to be entertaining. That's what people don't get. Stop trying to look at them as failures for the CGI and changes and start looking at them as an adaptation. It's called an ADAPTATION  for a reason. People need to stop judging so harshly. If not for the fact that they're actually doing a very good job with these films then for the simple fact that's they're just movies.

I mean I understand why fans will be annoyed due to the fact they never used as much practical effects as they did in the original trilogy but it's been nearly 10 Years since then so they were obviously going to increase the visual effects. Plus 10 Years ago visual effects were new and exciting take for example gollum everyone felt he looked fantastic and everyone was excited about the possibility of these fantastic visuals that we could do and nowadays but currently high visual effects are the norm in Hollywood and people are more aware of the technology that's been used so I feel that's why many people may feel a bit strongly against them!

These movies look amazing, who the crap cares how they were made because THEY LOOK EPIC.

The only time I complain about something like that is when the animations are terrible and in this case, they aren't.....in fact, they are stunning.....and also, the fact that people say the trolls and monsters in this movie are completely unrealistic and not believable is literally the dumbest comment ive ever heard....people, they are make believe trolls in a make believe universe filled with make believe characters and you say they aren't realistic?? and frankly I don't understand why Ian McKellen was crying,¬†I mean I know what he was trying to say but when they filmed the Lord of The¬†Rings, as well as the Hobbit movies, they traveled to¬†amazingly beautiful places to film, so the fact that he gets upset with filming¬†alone confuses me.....I mean I feel for him but c'mon dude, you get paid and get to travel to some of the most beautiful places on earth, heck I haven't been outside the USA¬†once and I don't get paid to live in boring¬†ol' Texas¬†but I'm not here crying when I don't get my way....not trying to be inconsiderate cause green screen doesn't sound fun but I am just sick and tired of all the hate that these films get.....

2014-11-20T08:04:16,"This looks better than the last two hobbit movies, which isn't a great feat. They are simultaneously over-embellished and lazy. I grew up with the lotr movies, these recent movies do not compare at all favourably. Jackson has truly pulled a George Lucas.  By any measure from the quality of the colour grading to even the casting (all very poor except for bilbo and characters retained from lotr) these movies have been very disappointing for me. There is no perceptible sense of threat, the villains aren't scary, because they are animated, and action too frequently descends into video game territory and is ludicrously physicsless, I greatly missed the effect of such performers as Lawrence Makoare (Lurtz, Gothmog, Witch-King) that are not adequately replaced by computer magic. I now am regretfully going to turn to some absolute legends, the script by Walsh, Boyens and Jackson is lazy and makes for poorly structured movies as it was never meant to span 3 films (pj milking it for all its worth) filled with empty one liners and stupid gags. Sir Richard Taylor, yes I will go there, some of the design is detached from the possible as the movie makers have gotten carried away. There is a supreme lack of the defining aesthetic of lotr, that it should look like history not like improbable fantasy. Sir Howard Shoare, the scores to lotr are absolute masterpieces. I can't say I remember any of the tunes from these hobbit movies, but I could hum for you now a lot of lotr stuff (even as musically untalented as I am). Andrew Lesnie, who is the absolute genius DP has gone for such fantastical lighting I don't believe the environment, I don't like 48fps it just looks awful. Stephen Fry, I am one of his biggest fans and think he is a fine actor but doesn't fit and feels out of kilter with the Middle Earth of mortensen's Aragorn, hill's Theoden, bean's Boromir and Tyler's Arwen. This is typical of these movies, they don't function on any level as a credible sequel. Having said all of that, this movie may be saved by that line from Gabdalf at the end of this trailer, all hail the almighty Mackellan.",1,0,Daniel Allen,iVAgTiBrrDA,-0.0005050505050504931,2014-11-20 08:04:16,True,True

I know that Jackson took creative galore over The Hobbit saga as opposed to the LoTR trilogy, but does that account for flipping off on a movie bred that answer to many of the fans which still has the LoTR 'craze'? This movie probably won't abide to what the original book is about, but, think about it. Do you really stick to what you're supposed to do? Have you not tried and get out of your miserable, comfy hole? Do you really know what's best in the interest of yourself? Have you ever asked yourself, what if, what's written on the book for this movie translated to the silver screen and what is on said screen for this particular movie went to the book? You would be typing the same exact derogatory remarks about the movie which is not the same from the book, as you are now, you Hobbit detractors. Sure, you never know if you would do so, but, though the CGI is too exaggerated(Take, for example, how the Orcs look from the LoTR trilogy as compared to The Hobbit's Orcs, which is so less terrifying than the LoTR ones), Legolas looks.......... different(What's wrong in keeping his original look, Mr Jackson?), and this probably won't stand up to Return Of The King, it certainly will give what most people want, which is the shock and the ""wow"" factor, and another story to know from Middle-Earth. Look at how much money the last two installments of The Hobbit made and tell me I'm off my mark. And I'm pretty sure that some of those people who begged for a new installment of Middle-Earth criticized The Hobbit for not being what they felt it should be, and I wonder if they will still be bitching on another Middle-Earth saga release if The Hobbit never sprang up. One of these days, people should learn to at least appreciate what they receive, no matter how rigged it might be. And hey.

Peter Jackson left out ALOT like Tom Bombadil and all the stuff about the ents. And the reason the hobbit is split into three movies is because in the book there was so much action and in lotr the rings it was very stretched and wordy.

2014-12-05T02:36:15,"In my opinion, I don't think the Hobbit is going to be good. The 3 movies are supposedly based on the book The Hobbit? They are literally just making stuff up as they go along, for those who are too lazy to read, there was no Pale Orc or, or Legolas, not even a love story between Kili and whatever that Elf Girls name is... And the Lord of the Rings References? Constantly talking about Sauron and crap... This is the Hobbit... The Story of Bilbo Baggins and his adventure with Gandalf and the Dwarves, not just a sequel to the Lord of The Rings (Don't argue, it's pretty much what it has turned into..). The Hobbit is supposed to be it's own adventure, it's own (ONE) movie would've cut the cake, but Peter had to go and Pretty Much Rip Apart everything the Lord of the Rings was good for... Don't get me wrong, the Lord of the Rings added and left out quite a bit from the original trilogy, but they did it right... They didn't make a whole movie toward a battle that only lasted two chapters in the book... (Yes, the Battle of the Five Armies only lasted about 2 chapters, for those who do not read)...

2014-12-05T03:27:13,"Yes, The Hobbit is a cash grab.  Perhaps the CGI is too heavy.  Maybe it didn't exactly follow the book to the letter.  And yes, maybe the 48 fps was a different  experience that some didn't like.  But throughout each of these films, I found myself loving every second of it.  People keep complaining that this film didn't live up to LOTR, yet they forget that the Hobbit story was written by Tolkien as a fun adventure instead of the detailed epic that Lord of the Rings was.  In retrospect, The Lord of the Rings (book or film) is one large story split into three parts.  Its my favorite film franchise and book series ever, so I was very interested to see what Jackson would do with this new trilogy.  With the first two installments, I had a blast.  The action (particularly in the Goblin-town tunnels in An Unexpected Journey and the barrel riding scene in The Desolation of Smaug) were very well-done and entertaining.  The characters were likable and interesting, with Freeman's Bilbo being the best version of the character yet and Armitage's Thorin Oakenshield being a fantastic addition.  I could feel the emotion that made the Lord of the Rings such an epic experience, with Bilbo's speech about home & the dwarves walking through the caves of their lost home being truly moving scenes.  Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Smaug was a revelation.  The actor not only brought the mighty dragon to the big screen, he truly gave us the most memorable dragon ever in cinema.  I'd argue he has been the most charismatic and interesting villain in the entire franchise, including Lord of the Rings.  The Riddles in the Dark scene between Gollum and Bilbo was absolutely brilliant, actually making me laugh and feel the tension throughout.  Andy Serkis will always be captivating as Gollum, who will soon become one of the most fleshed out characters of the franchise.  So was the Hobbit a cash grab?  Yes, but I don't see all these complaints about The Hunger Games or Harry Potter's final installments being turned into two parts.  While I really loved both parts of Mockingjay and the Deathly Hallows, they never fully sold me on them being made into two films.  But whether or not the Hobbit should've been split into a trilogy, to me they have justified their existence by each being a memorable and epic experience.  And when people complain how it doesn't follow the book, they seem to forget the Lord of the Rings trilogy really didn't follow the books much either.  Jackson made a lot of changes to the source material, and the results were fine with me.  Legolas wasn't in the book, yet Bloom was a welcome return who was great in each scene.  Radagast the Brown was a little strange at first, but he was certainly a fun character who shouldn't even be compared to the horror that is Jar Jar Binks.  He isn't George Lucas, who created a prequel trilogy based on action figures and merchandise.  Jackson instead has crafted a very entertaining and exciting trilogy that I felt has justified being created.  I would agree some of the CGI could've been toned down a bit, i.e. the Orcs not having the same impact being CGI beasts instead of real actors.  Makes it lose a bit of the grit, but doesn't ruin the experience and I truly still felt that I was in the same Middle-Earth that I fell in love with 13 years ago.  The Hobbit was never meant to surpass Lord of the Rings, but when its all finished in a few weeks we will have the best saga of films ever made.  I will watch all six Middle-Earth films with a smile on my face, loving every second of it.  While The Hobbit may have been a cash grab, most films in Hollywood nowadays still haven't come close to the incredible impact that these films have on people including myself.  I realize most people enjoy these films, but I just wanted to address people complaints about its comparison to Lord of the Rings.  So thank you Peter Jackson, for once again giving me an unforgettable experience.  ",1,0,Brad Wright,iVAgTiBrrDA,0.31167521595603787,2014-12-05 03:27:13,True,True

The relevance of all this ^ ?¬† I'm still looking forward to this film enormously!¬† :)  Too many people are moaning about discrepencies between the book and the films.¬† The same accusations could be levelled at the LOTR films, which I also loved.¬† I accepted the fact that journeys were truncated, that Tom Bombadil and Goldberry were left out, that Glorfindel was replaced by Arwen and the whole Aragorn/Arwen love story padded out.¬† I could understand the cinematic reasons for such choices.¬† I even overlooked more serious deviations.¬† Such as Saruman working directly for Sauron, instead of for himself... or the complete omission of the 'Scouring of the Shire'.¬† The latter, for me, being one of the most important chapters in the book.¬† It's omission was the only serious complaint I had with the films.¬† I let it go though, as overall he had captured the feel of the books so well and the main story remained largely unchanged.  So we come to the Hobbit.¬† A slim book, written for children.¬† Albeit one that is also enjoyed by adults.¬† He could have made a children's film, interspersed with references for adults but I doubt that would have gone down well.¬† Especially since the expectations following his LOTR films were so high.¬† Instead he chose to go in a similar vein.¬† Obviously it would require more padding but... and it's a crucial 'but'... virtually all of the extra story is either implied and extrapolated from the Hobbit itself, or sourced from Tolkien's other books set in, or about, Middle Earth.¬† The main narrative storyline remains unbroken and all of the major events in the book also occur in the film.¬† He's stated, quite clearly, that this wasn't a straightforward re-telling of the Hobbit alone, that he wanted to widen the scope to include other elements of Middle Earth that were contemporary and to expand on some sections of the Hobbit that were interesting but for which there was little detail.¬† I think he's done this pretty successfully.¬† Yes there are elements added that don't occur anywhere in Tolkiens writings but they aid the plot and the narrative drive.¬† The timeline of a couple of events maybe slightly out too.¬† None of these detract from the film, nor do they feel as if they are things that don't belong in Middle Earth.¬† Even the slight anachronisms don't feel particularly anachronistic, in the context of the film.  You are already suspending your disbelief, re' magic, elves, dwarves, hobbits, orcs... the whole of Middle Earth in fact.¬† Just relax, suspend it a tad more and enjoy the films for what they are,¬† Great storytelling, the mould of Tolkien, set in Tolkiens world.¬† No the are not an exact representation of the book, 'the Hobbit'.¬† They aren't meant to be and they never could be.¬† If it annoys you so much, that they aren't an exact re-telling, that new characters have been added, parts expanded on and other (generally consistent) bits added... then don't go and see the films.¬† For those that are able to overcome their 'rage' at such things, sit back and enjoy the show!¬† ;)",1,0,Codex7777,iVAgTiBrrDA,0.15536162786162788,2014-12-08 03:53:27,True,True

You stole that scene from me. Though it's hard to choose, probably my favourite scenes were the Dol Guldur battle, Bilbo and Gandalf sitting silently Thorin's madness and when he remembers who he really is, Thorin's death: Freeman and Ermitage portrayed that beautifully and it was really sad.

2014-12-12T16:10:04,"For everyone thinking about going to the movie, think twice. I can't submit a review on metacritic for the ""movie is yet to bee released"". But what you see in the trailer/ teaser is not what you get from the movie - Of course you get all the parts as seen but under different circumstances. The trailer does make a good impression and the majority lies on drastic character moments. Be not mistaken. The movie sadly became too CGI infested and parts in too many ways from the original (book) to be fully enjoyed - especially the second half. The battle is just a pain to watch because there's no depth (it can't be described otherwise, you just feel like it's second nature and nice to look at but misses real threat). Further the love stories and drama are over the top. Maybe it's just my opinion but the majority of spectators in the cinema I was were laughing all over those scenes, cause they were so over-exaggerated. I don't say all is bad but the second half of the movie is - overall - hard to watch (and I don't mean all 100% of the second half) cause it's unreal und unbelievable (Yes, I'm aware it's a fantasy movie but why does everything has to be so pumped up??). Maybe those who are going to watch the movie anyway will think of my opinion as unreliable - which is your right, as I'm subjective - and others will like the movie in the end for what it is. I'm simply saying it is not what it could be (which means not a dream-version where everything is perfect, but a good narrative as well as execution similar to the quality of LotR) and I really miss that the bad parts (CGI, not true to story, exaggeration, drama & love story, character behavior) ruin something that could have been great in the end.",0,0,Marco B√§chtold,iVAgTiBrrDA,0.1194727891156463,2014-12-12 16:10:04,False,True

Without spoilers!  To say that it was just great - to say nothing, because I would have given Peter Jackson Award for the Smaug's attack on the Lake Town and powerful ending. And for the film as a whole.  Yes, there are drawbacks, such as a suspicious story focusing on unimportant personalities, definitely some strange scenes and inappropriate humor. The battle itself could be a little more ambitious, though, and so very cool.  Nevertheless, despite all the bad places, the film does not disappoint. Entry is so good that I shed a few tears from what I saw familiar faces and the coolest dragon in the history of cinema at its most violent state.  The film itself (by the way, it will be shorter the previous parts) stumbles here and there, but still kept confident. Well, that Comrade Jackson master of battle scenes - could be observed in the other books of the trilogy by Tolkien. The ending is simple and good.  A little sad that such a great director says goodbye to the world of Middle-earth. If you love fantasy, dragons, battles, intrigues, read the book ""The Hobbit"" and she fascinated you - feel free to go. You will not regret. I would have went. 10 times.

I am really dissapointed by this movie actually. There were so many cliffhangers that the film just got boring. It was also super-predictable, you knew every time what would happen. Also hate the fact how the dragon died. They made the dragon so epic and built his ""epicness"" up in two movies, just to end it like this. It feels like Peter Jackson just wanted to get him out of the way and so he just killed him in the prelog. Sure, the death could have been good if they just would have made the dragon just a ""dragon"" without personality and shown that he was just a ""object"" who was not really important. ¬†But the picture I got of him in the two first movies was not that one. He deserved a better death and I feel like they could have made something more with him. And when you really think about what happend in the movie in almost 3 HOURS, it was pretty much only a battle at the same location all the movie. 3 hours without any kind of emotion, just fast cuts and weird fighting scenes. Then in the end they just made the ""feels-train"" kick in and killed pretty much every important character which made the ending awful imo. And wtf was up with Azogs closest ""orc-friend""? He sucked at fighting in the second movie and got his ass kicked by legolas and had to escape. But in this movie he whopped ass like never before, dosent make any sense. This movie was not good and stop pretending it was. The CGI was also really bad at some few scenes in the movie, not cool. Same goes with the music, the music has always been really good in the LOTR films but in this movie the music felt like it did not play any important part and had no impact on the film (The other hobbit films used the music alot better.) Imo Peter Jackson can do alot better and the people who actually say good things about this movie, I think should ""rethink"" abit and actually try to accept the fact that this movie was not that great, even tho I really dont want to believe it myself.

2014-12-15T02:39:41,"Let me just present an opinion of mine regarding the controversy around the Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings. The lord of the rings movies are almost universally preferred over the Hobbit and that is an opinion of mine also, I love the Lord Of The Rings movies because of their gritty and realistic feel whereas the Hobbit has a really bright and goofy feel to it. It's almost as if the LOTR films are centred around the politics of it all rather than the actual adventure. But I also love The Hobbit movies, all three. I just recently saw this one and I now feel like I have the right to share my thoughts. Let me start from the beginning, Frodo in the Lord Of The Rings sets out on his journey for a number of reason, one of which being that he has grown up most of his life with his uncle Bilbo and I have no doubt that throughout the years he has heard Bilbo's stories of his wonderful adventures with Magic and Dragons countless times. So when Frodo sets out on his journey, he has an expectation (which I believe he talks about) of a wonderful goofy, magical adventure with dwarves and goblins and treasure but is swiftly cut down to reality when he treks through middle earth and watches his friends get captured, killed and twisted by the power of this inexplicable evil that he must bare. That is the roots of the story. So for Frodo to have this realisation that life is not like the stories he has so often heard, there have to be stories to match this expectation. If the Hobbit was so dark and gritty, it would not only feel weird, it would actually take away from the thrill of the Lord Of The Rings (for me personally at least). There would be no reason for Frodo to expect a simple adventure and there would be no shock value for the audience of comparing the two tones of the each trilogy. So I think the fact that from start to finish, the hobbit looked like an (awesome) video game is exactly what those movies needed. I think Peter Jackson made these movies what they should've¬†been, it just comes down to whether or not you like that. I do not feel that it is a comment on Peter Jackson's direction. After all, I don't think anyone has a problem with the action in any of the movies. I would be shocked if they did. He gives a masterclass in directing action.

There can't be a better movie than LOTR.  The first two Hobbit movies were really enjoyable. Sure there are some flaws only LOTR is flawless after all. Everything was going so well. The tention was building thorought Unexpected journej and Desolation of Smaug. The beginning of Battle of the five armies was also superb. But after they killed the dragon in went downside so fast that it ended in the bottom of the ocean. So much hacking and slashing and no story at all. Elf/dwarf romance was silly as hell. And suddenly the movie became a 3d game. Legolas was deffinately playing God of war, controlling trolls with the joyst.... ahem sword. Flying with bads like Kratos with Harpies, I mean come on. This movie was never supposed to be about how many orks can you kill in ridiculuous ways. It became a parody. I didn't even cared about anyone in the end. I cryed my eyes in LOTR several times in sad scenes like Boromir death, here it all seems lame and like a video game.  Now I fully agree with Cristopher Tolkien that Jackson shouldn't be allowed to ruin Silmarillion and make it a CGI orc slaughter movie. I personally would give such a difficult project to Chris Nolan.

2014-12-22T14:25:06,"A review of the film I did for my forum -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The latest hobbit film is utterly ridiculous! It is rife with ludicrous and deeply embarrassing overacting,¬† laboured pontification, and a torrent of mindless slashing, all delivered in over zealous CGI. The actors declaimed as though on a stage in an auditorium, but perhaps they were desperate to gain the audience's attention because they knew they would be fighting for attention with the CGI action which was made less for being so grandiose and arbitrary. Only a rather charming female elf seemed remotely engaged with the real world and her diary was filled to the brim with casually decapitating orcs, being rescued and sobbing, leaving little time for anything else.  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/EvangelineLillyAsTauriel.jpg/220px-EvangelineLillyAsTauriel.jpg  The film was just downright childish, simplistic and bombastic.  Much of the film was an extended battle scene between ""five armies"" that was chaotic, confused and meaningless with the highlight being a fashion statement by an elven army that thought it was on parade, a fashion parade. The elves had the shiniest, gaudiest and best polished armour that seemed designed to light up the battlefield and set new standards of Middle Earth couture. The Elves' idea of fighting seemed to be posing and dancing; they pirouetted and pranced about in a staged choreography that they must have practised day and night because never a foot or spear was out of place in a faultlessly synchronised display.  The director, Peter Jackson, appears to be incapable of delivering credible¬† characters or narrative. His characters are simply immature; they were schoolchildren playing at being adults and almost all the actors seem to have been instructed to add dramatic weight to their delivery by constantly shouting or grimacing in a failing struggle for gravitas which made them look silly .  The only redeeming features were the girly elf and the rather charming underlying theme of the virtue of English manners and understatement, exemplified by the diffident character of Bilbo who would interject some of the melodramatic and bombastic declamations by other characters with a timid comment, usually a plea for everyone to get along, calm down and be nice. Oddly, the dragon, despite being a sadistic genocidal creature who delivered the most spine chilling moments and most credibility to a character, managed to bring a touch of decorum to proceedings with his perfect diction and grammar.  The film attempted to depict some human frailty, well dwarven frailty, in the corrosive effect on the mind of power and wealth; judgement and empathy were suggested as immediate victims along with general mental well being, but¬† it failed horribly. The script was hopelessly inept and ponderous as it tackled these themes and struggled to offer anything more than might be expected of an ill-read¬† teenager forced to consider the subject.  The end of the battle was particularly silly. The elves, having put on a fashion show, retired to clean their armour for the next performance, the dwarves were hacked to a standstill by orcs who had a clever plan, apparently, for some of them to retreat just as they were on the verge of victory, when suddenly the battlefield was overtaken by hordes of huge eagles who could transform into killer bears. They came from absolutely nowhere and without any narrative justification whatsoever, but nonetheless they had a firm idea of their role and slashed away at the remaining orcs. A brief shot of a character on a sleigh who had rescued Gandalf in an early part of the film suggested he was controlling the aerial army, but he could have been a birdwatcher for all the narrative sense his appearance made. It was weirdly arbitrary; as though the director had got bored with hours of battle scenes and turned to the last page of the script, leaving all of the intervening storyline unrendered. The remaining orcs were dispensed in a moment and the backup orc army disappeared and suddenly Bilbo and Gandalf waved their goodbyes after some mutual compliments and set some of the narrative elements for Lord of the Rings.  5/10  Oddly, despite it being littered with flaws, ridiculously immature characterisation, and an inept script, I was entertained. It was so bad it was good in some ways and I don't resent having seen it, and of course there was the elven girly and the fabulously cultured dragon.",2,2,TheRumpus,iVAgTiBrrDA,0.009112226157680701,2014-12-22 14:25:06,False,True

2014-12-28T08:53:08,"It was cool. I noticed many conveniences like in the other films. There are film rating guide lines and regulations that I know filmmakers must follow in order to keep the rating they desire upheld to their film and that lead me to believe that was why only Orcs were be headed and not humans which seemed dark but the humans weren't which took me out of it a bit. Whenever a human or ""light"" character would be killed they would be saved or some type of ""Dues ex Machina"" would happen to keep them alive. In relation to that I noticed some scenes had a ton of effort for conveniences. An example would be the hobbit in barrels knocking/defeating all the like 15 Orcs away while staying alive.  There were times where the movie wanted to be dark, then funny, then slap stick and dark again. But only horrific and brutal with chopping heads of the ""bad guys"" not the protagonist or ""heavenly like"" character like Legolas.  Legolas is annoying invincible and flawless and still wants to be Fred Flint stone whenever he can. When Woody from 'Toy Story' declared ""falling with style"" Legolas perfectly fits that phrase. This guy is untouchable to the pint where I want him to loose some and I shouldn't feel that way. He even took Rey Mysterio's wrestling love using his legs to clamp down on an Orcs neck and swing himself across to take the Orc down. I was like that's WWF üòÆüòë lol, I liked it a lil bit. This lead me to enjoy when the Head Orc beat him or ""roughed him up some"" and made him ""bleed his own blood"" ha ha haaaaaaaa..... ¬†That's goes with other characters too that unreasonably beat and over powered these strong Orcs with brute physical force with thin brittle arms (That lady Elf who had ""the hots"" for the one elf who almost ""took an arrow to the knee"" and had Legolas salty and jelly).  There were some funny moments and I liked some of them. I could see the film was about friendship, trust, journey ¬†and acceptance while conflicting with greed, race war, and power.¬†  I really liked the boss scene at the end which caught me off guard for a bit. It was recalling good.  Overall I could nit-pick the film a lot and point out a ton of minor things that would make sense for the individual characters motives but I liked it. To counter argue the plausibility of characters not doing what would make sense is to keep the suspense going because if they didn't then the story may not be that compelling or thrilling in tense moments, like when the lead hobbit could've slice the head orcs neck when he was behind him as they were looking at the Eagles. It's all for the sake of Storting telling and I keep that in mind as well.",0,0,Daniel Banks,iVAgTiBrrDA,0.10415479582146249,2014-12-28 08:53:08,False,True

Also, some of the physics done by legolas were retarded as fuck. A lot of scenes were so not properly developed.. I would give about 7/10. Again, I might be biased because of LOTR.

When you watch it as a single movie of 9 hours, it transforms into a much much better movie, a work of art if I dare. It becomes much more well structured, thrilling and emotionally deeper and empathic than watching each film seperately, because it is a single story, and should be viewed as one. Yeah, the films are 7-8/10 each seperately, but together 10/10.

Again, not seen in the movie.  3) Lastly, I don't remember any speech from Gandalf in the movie either, yet in this trailer we hear a line that sounds like the end of a motivational speech.

2014-12-31T01:55:40,"I finally saw the film, (spoilers here, so if you have not seen the film then read on at your own risk!) I would say Peter entertained me 68.5% of the time, saw the 3D version, which also added a touch of wonder here and there but was not used to full impact. There were sections that followed closely with the movie that were well done, sections that were made up that were OK and areas that could have been better. I did particularly enjoy the Dol Guldur sequence with the White Council battling Sauron and the Nazgul (taken from the LOTR ROTK appendices).¬† I personally did not like the way Thranduil was portrayed in this one, he still came off as pompous and self centered, although he did attack the mountain with his army in the books, his intentions and his personality were noble in nature, maybe a bit more rustic compared to Elrond, but admirable. I also felt like the battle scene toward the end of the film did not seem to show the Eagles, Elves, Dwarves and Men winning the fight in any sort of detail, it switched focus to the private battles between Azog, Bolg and the Dwarves, (and Tauriel) and when all the 1:1 conflicts were over the big battle seemed to have ended too. I also was hoping to see more Eagles and Beorn in bear form fighting, I suppose those things will be included on the extended version DVD which I am sure will come out around May 2015. Overall we have begun to take Mr. Jackson for granted, and hardcore Tolkien fans are not going to like many of the liberties he and his writers have taken with the plot, this once again is a film interpretation and is aimed at entertaining both fans of the book and those who have never read them, any director who would take on Tolkien's spectacular mythos and is 68% successful has to be commended, if he changed his mind in 5 years and recreated the Silmarillion in some form I would still shell out $15 or so to see it.

But it wouldn't just be a fighting game you could be on the front lines but if you wanted you could be a stealth person imagine it the humans have pushed into erebor and they are all charging through and your alone watching them from a far. It would have free running and levels with like a level cap of 300 and when you reach the max level you can be one of the heroes for example the dwarves you could be thorin but there could only be 1 on each side.

The matches would take ages as people could retake objectives for example back to the human one if the dwarves manage to push the humans out they can rebuild the barrier if they find enough rubble.

I found the movies to be quite faithful to the book and vastly successful at bringing the world of Tolkein to life.  Tolkein was very strict with his creations and when he sold them, those who obtained them were at first terrified to even approach them. Even Peter Jackson was lost at how to begin tackling the tremendous task of bringing a book to life on the big screen. And while, yes, it does contradict some things in the book, I will go right ahead and defy everyone now who is going to condemn me for saying this.  Tolkein would be proud.   It is hard to speak for a dead man, and even harder to say that I enjoyed the books more than the movie, and was amazed at its imagery and the faithful representations of the characters from the book. Sure some things were off... The size of Durin's Bane, a little comedy sprinkled onto the trolls, etc. and the tiny risks taken with a vast majority of them being hits.  Tolkein knew that there were few who could truly appreciate his work, and I have to say that Jackson is one of the true appreciations for its majesty.   For those of you who hate the movies and spit on any adaption that is not an original Tolkein work, that is fine. But respect those who love Tolkein for another reason, and thank those who read the books after seeing the movies. Thank those who shed tears for Boromir and feared Frodo's death. Thank those who laughed at the lighthearted movie Gollum and the extra scenes created by the hand of the original writer as well as Jackson himself.  We all seem to forget from time to time that no one is Tolkein himself, but there are others besides ourselves who share our deep love of Middle-Earth and all it's people...  When we learn to accept that... I believe we will be better for it, and be one step closer to understanding the true genius of Tolkeins creations, and those clever and brave enough to take up the pen he left for them.  Middle-Earth will never be forgotten... And it will be us to carry on its legend to our children, and our children's children.

But it is mainly for children. Some characters didn't even have personalities, for ex. the dwarves. Only Thorin but he was also pretty shallow. Some scenes were so short (like their visit to Elrond in the first part) that to put that in a film would be ridiculous. Bringing back Azog is also not a bad idea. Bringing in Sauron (since there is a mention in the book that Gandalf took care of him) it is not a bad idea. Bringing in Tauriel is not a bad idea since there were no female characters in the story. And it is also interesting that Peter basically switched Bard's and Thranduil's behaviour towards the dwarves. In the book Thranduil didn't rush the war. Bard was the more hostile one. But my only problem with this third part is the ending. SPOILER: I think Peter should have shortened the fight scenes and given a proper burial to all the dwarves that had fallen.

If you didn't know, art makes it possible to stretch one single page of writing to a whole series... but that involves creativity and many other things you're not exactly aware (or capable) of. Secondly, using insults and dirty words all over means you are still around 14 and have no superior reasoning capacities, have a very poor self esteem and many psychological issues. Fact! Also, it's beyond pathetic to give so much time of your life to hating something you don't like. Just get over it! Judging by something so simple as the likes and dislikes bar here, by the web activity of fans, by the hype around the premieres and all events and, ultimately, by the numbers of sold tickets and DVS's, Hobbit haters are definitely a very tiny minority. You don't like this film? Fine! You are perfectly entitled to that... but you can only come across as ridiculous with your silly complaints. No, they didn't 'butcher' Tolkien's work. If you want to call it like that, every movie adaptation does that. That's why it's an 'adaptation'. That's why it's 'based on' a book. You're only showing you have no idea about how art is made, especially how they make the transition from book to film. No, Tolkien isn't rolling in the grave, because he was smart enough to be aware of all the possibilities when he agreed to give away the rights. Also, you're no necromancer to know what he's doing beyond the grave, nor did you meet him while he was alive. And then, Christopher is a bad argument here, because he's a bitter old man looking for massive earnings and biting the hand that feeds.

When i was a kid, i saw LOTR for the first time in theaters and was amazed, which prompted me to read the LOTR book which is one of my favorite books. Then when the hobbit came out a few years ago, that made me read the Hobbit which i absolutely loved. From there i've also read much more of Tolkien's work such as the Silmarillion for example.  I understand Jackson added some extra characters that were not in the book (tauriel, pale orc, legolas, etc). But lets face it guys, this is hollywood, they need a love story (tauriel and kili), an antagonist (pale orc), and one of the most beloved characters from LOTR to get fans' attention (legolas).  Say what you want about the movies, i thought they were phenomenal and were definitely worth the money i spent on a movie ticket. Of course i prefer the books, but the movies help me get a better picture in my head of what the landscape/characters look like which helps me in reading the books. And everyone is mad about the CGI orcs in this film, but i think the orcs look so much more badass than in LOTR where it was just guys with terrible makeup jobs.

For lovers of the LOR series (and you'd have to screwed in the brain not to be a fan of those movies frankly...) this latest movie is much closer to them.  The first two Hobbit movies felt directed at kids, suffered CGI overkill, and just left most serous LOR fans flat. This latest movie is much more adult oriented, CGI used to enhance vs dominate as it did for LOR, solid acting, great battle scenes, and Action from start to finish.

The debate will be if JRR is the true author of the Silmarillion/Lost Tales (The only real way to make more Movies/TV shows). JRR may have written the material but his son Christopher finished and published both works so its up for debate who actually ""wrote it"". So lets do some math.  If JRR Wrote it: Died in 1973 so its 27 years to 2000 2000+43( The remaining # of years) = The year 2043 (Best Case Scenario)  If Christopher Wrote it: Still alive but 90 years old (lets assume he will die within 5 years, kind of rude I know) 2015,2020 +70 = Between the years of 2085 and 2090 (Worse Case Scenario)  I'm not a legal expert so i'm sure this will be debated endlessly in courts.

2016-02-09T02:48:55,"Sorry this is so long but I just had to speak my mind...  I don't understand the hate on these movies even through everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect that. Stretching them out to three instead of two was the best decesion and you can understand why if you watch all of the behind the scenes in the extended addition (which is absolutely worth the hours upon hours it takes to watch :D).  Two films would not have been enough. Shoot, three barely is if you were to include every detail of the book. I know that is what many of us really want but I understand how hard that is to achieve. However these films I truly believed enhanced the book. I know Peter Jackson added in a lot that was not in the book. However I do not see those things as changes that hurt the story but additions that enhance it and help the viewers (especially ones who have not read the book) piece the story together. When your reading the book your OK with details being left out. But from a filmmakers point of view you can't have those gaps or it hinders the flow of the story. So Peter Jackson and his amazing crew filled it in. Everything they added was not blindly thrown in, it was carefully thought out and investigated by breaking down pieces of the Apendecies and then placed it. Not to mention time had to be added in for the fight sequences which are not elaborated in the book because it is almost impossible to have a written description of the battles. But for a film you need to draw the fights out to add to the energy. Legolas and Tauriel were the biggest debate. For me I loved them (although I am not a very critical person and is almost good with anything). To me they added to the storytelling about the Mirkwood elves and gave you a deeper attachment to Thranduil. Tauriel also provided a strong female presence and her and Killi hinted at the scene with Gimli and Gladriel thus expanding on the complicated relationship with Dwarves and Elves. Also who is to say that there wasn't a character like Tauriel amongst the woodland elves. Having her and Legolas split off to spy on the orc strong hold helped connect why and where this second orc army came from. Her grief over Killi also helped add to the heartbreak.   My ONLY issue is that their was no mourning scene over Fili like there was for his brother and uncle.

Now, vast majority of the people that have seen this did not read the book, but I did, and you wanna know how long this section of the book was? SIX PAGES, out of a 200 page book. I don't even know why Sauron was in this, he wasn't in the book at all, they made thorin look way more evil than he was, there was no romance between the elves- strike that, the elves didn't have a story at all in the book, and just overall... what the fuck. This is probably the worst trilogy of movies made from a book ever made, which is a shame because the original trilogy of LOTR was almost flawless, and that makes me disappointed. I see all these comments saying ""best movie ever"" which is just ridiculous.  In the chapter that has the battle, the lake towns people realize that if the dragon is dead they are entitled to the money in the mountain, not knowing the dwarves are still alive. A bunch of stuff happens and in the end the dwarves build a wall to the entrance of the mountain, and the Lake town allied with the elves, and they marched on. When they arrive all three parties discuss the treasure and how it will be distributed blah blah blah. At night Bilbo climbs down from the wall and gives the arkenstone to the humans and elves, to keep everyone from fighting. However, the goblins attack and all out war ensues, and Bilbo is ex communicated due to giving away the arkenstone. After a while the eagles show up, and Bilbo gets hit in the head with a rock and misses the rest of the battle. When he wakes, it's all over.  That's it, about six pages and they made a two and a half hour movie out of it. What scummy cash grab.",0,0,Cthulhu Malone,iVAgTiBrrDA,-0.12253086419753084,2018-11-12 20:15:28,False,False
