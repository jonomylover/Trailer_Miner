But I have a few things to discuss. 1. Gayle Foreman has clearly never played an instrument, judging by her lack of any musical knowledge whatsoever. There is NO WAY POSSIBLE that Mia could ever be that good just by taking lessons from a college student and then a guy who works at a record store. Also I should mention that the song in the trailer is NOT Beethoven's 3rd cello sonata. Also, she would never, ever leave her cello at school, even if her life depended on it. 2. This book was terribly written. Don't get me wrong, the idea is AMAZING, but the book was terrible. The accident just somehow popped up a few pages in, and it goes by way too quickly. Plus, all sometimes it's best NOT to describe every single detail of the accident. I literally wanted to throw up. 3. The character Mia is terrible. She tries to get you on her side by saying everything she hates about herself. In TFIOS, at least Hazel Lancaster is sarcastic about her bad features, but Mia is just plain terrible. She is really smart and really pretty, but she is always talking about how she doesn't deserve adam, yaddah yaddah yaddah. Also, she's selfish. How is Adam more important than her dead family?

I think the director was very clever in his casting of Mia's parents; they were, to me, the most lovable characters in the entire story, with their laid back attitude and humor. It makes you think of adults you love to be around. And it also makes you think of any adults you've lost. When the parents were announced dead, that was the first heartbreak of the story. The story was ultimately about choices and how they will affect the scheme of life; it is not a love story, even if it appears as one. The fact that Mia would constantly be tempted by ""the light"" at the hospital was also painful, with every horrible event pushing her to walk towards it.

But me Speech-Therapist said to READ the Book FIRST then WATCH the Movie SECOND... So I did that. But I still had trouble picturing things.)... Then today August 31st, 2016- Wednesday I finally finished reading the ""If I Stay"" Book and I NEVER cried whilst reading the Book. After reading the Book... I watched the Movie which was good that I rated it 3/5 Stars. But I was really disappointed because the Movie didn't have the same gloried bits in the Book in the Movie itself... For example... Adam creating a distraction by Brooke Vega and other things. Less Teddy in the Movie. Serious Kim in the Movie. I could say that the Book was much better than the Movie! 😍😍😍 Now me watching this Video... It makes me want to read the Sequel! 😱😱😱 So I am still deciding if I should read it or not...

I think this movie is very sad and romantic so i suggest you watch it and remember how life is special to every single one of us we were born to live our lives and enjoy and appreciate who were we supposed to be, some people dont appreciate what  they are given but you have to because you only live once and you cant go back in time either way you want to or not... you dont need change anything about you there is something special about everyone of us. I Peyton appreciate what has given and what im going true, is in the past all of the bulling i got true just because i had someone who cared and loved me for me.
