2019-04-19T17:50:39,"Lorraine Warren has just passed away on April 18th, 2019. As a long-term fan of both her and Ed, I am devastated. They were a wonderful couple who passionately and courageously conducted more than 10,000+ cases all over the world. They never charged a single penny and selflessly helped people out of the goodness of their hearts. I‚Äôm sad that they‚Äôre both gone now, but at least they‚Äôre together again ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª  *EDIT: Whoever says Lorraine and Ed were frauds are being very ignorant. THEY WERE NOT frauds! They were legitimate, experienced, and professional demonologists and agents of the Catholic Church, who had the highest regards for The Warrens and their work. Ed was the only non-ordained Demonologist and Lorraine was a very gifted clairvoyant. Like I said, they NEVER charged any money for their services that they provided for 60+ years. So how is that fraudulent? They were both equally passionate about what they did, they traveled around the world helping people in paranormal distress, bring peace back into family households, and educated thousands on the paranormal. My friend was a personal friend of Lorraine and he said she was nothing less than A SAINT. She was the most loving, compassionate, caring, genuine, kind, selfless, empathetic, wonderful woman he‚Äôd ever met, and he witnessed her clairvoyance in action. She was an extraordinary woman who never went anywhere without Ed, and Ed never went anywhere without Lorraine. They were true soulmates and their skilled and passionate abilities in the supernatural brought them together. They touched the lives of countless people and were genuinely GOOD PEOPLE. It really irks and bothers me when people accuse them of being ‚Äúfrauds‚Äù because that can‚Äôt be farthest from the truth. There‚Äôs definitely frauds in the world, but Ed and Lorraine were **_NOT_** one of them. They were legitimate, courageous professionals who used the light and love of God to banish out the darkness and evil of demons.*",2328,69,The Greek Pianist,bCxm7cTpBAs,0.21946778711484594,2019-04-19 17:50:39,True,True

Usually can't be helped but don't be an orphan, maybe? 8. Don't watch tapes that might kill you. EASILY AVOIDABLE. 9. If you find yourself already in a horror movie. DON'T TAKE SHOWERS, DON'T TAKE BATHS! Figure it out. 10. Stay away from Nuns. I don't know why they are such a danger, they just are.   Bonus tip, 'cause I'm so nice.

2019-06-17T06:05:03,"It really bothers me to hear some people accusing Ed and Lorraine of being frauds, con artists, fakes, etc. THEY WERE *NOT* frauds! They were legitimate, experienced, professional demonologists and agents of the Catholic Church, who had the highest regards for The Warrens and their work. They both valued their integrity and credibility with their career. Ed was the only non-ordained Demonologist recognized by The Vatican and Lorraine was a very gifted clairvoyant.       Like I said, they NEVER charged any money for their services they provided for 60+ years. So how is that fraudulent? They were both equally passionate about what they did, they traveled around the world helping people in paranormal distress, bring peace back into family households, and educated thousands on the paranormal.       My friend was a personal friend of Lorraine and he said she was nothing less than A SAINT. She was the most loving, compassionate, caring, genuine, kind, selfless, empathetic, wonderful woman he‚Äôd ever met, and he witnessed her clairvoyance in action. She was an extraordinary woman who never went anywhere without Ed, and Ed never went anywhere without Lorraine. They were true soulmates and their skilled and passionate abilities in the supernatural brought them together. They touched the lives of countless people and were genuinely GOOD PEOPLE.       It really irks and bothers me when people accuse them of being ‚Äúfrauds‚Äù because that can‚Äôt be farthest from the truth. There‚Äôs definitely frauds in the world, but Ed and Lorraine were *NOT* one of them.

2019-06-27T16:16:23,"As a HUGE fan of this universe since The Conjuring came out in 2013, it pains me to say this, but I was majorly disappointed with this movie. I think it was an ingenious concept to give us insight on the objects in that room which we have been curious about for years, but I think that the end result was very disappointing. There was SOO much emphases on 5 objects(the board game, the TV, the ferryman, the wedding dress, and the Hellhound) that we've only seen on screen for maybe a total of one second combined  leading up to this movie and therefore has harbored no curiousity whatsoever. Yet pillar objects such as the Samurai and the Monkey, who we've seen every. single. time. the camera is in that room were completely disregarded and done a MAJOR injustice. Even when the girls were reading through the case files, every one they read was one of the aforementioned 5 objects. We still don't know anything about the Samurai, who is a major focal point of the room. Not what he does, how he does it, where he came from, or even how he got a spot in the Warren room. The events that took place in the hall tell us that he was most likely in a war of some sort but that's not a shocking detail as he is literally a Samurai. Another detail of the movie that I cant shake, is how much time is spent in movie on absolute nonsense. We would get 20 minutes of dialogue for maybe 2 minutes worth of actual, important information. Im not talking about the Warren's giving details of them leaving or the school scene (which is very important). I'm talking about the 10 minutes in a car which old told us that Annabelle was a beacon to other spirits (which we already knew), the entire grocery store scene was a complete waste of time, and although some might disagree, I felt that the scene in the  Chicken coop and the entire backstory of the Friend of the Babysitter was time wasted. We have never even heard about this girl and for her to be plopped in as a main character in the movie out of nowhere just feels sloppy and not well thought out. Which is mind boggling to me considering the intricate web of stories and lives that intermingle and connect one movie to another. I know that based of this one movie there is potential for countless other movies in the future but i feel that more work and effort could have been made on this one.

The Warren's were fakes and this room is just like a charity shop even the original doll looks like a bad joke.
