They wasted a perfect idea when they could of just made a movie based on Alice Madness which a lot more people want than this.  Then again Alice Madness is based to much towards the original and this is a disney movie -_-  Even still all they did was Copy Pasted a premise that has already been done in a Video Game. She is in a Mental Institute... even the buildings look like something from Alice Madness which is again just lazy.,12,38,Kitsune - SpiritFoxGaming,x3IWwnNe5mc,0.140625,2016-04-27 14:21:01,True,True

Too bright and cheery and childish IMO.   Not hating on this film of course. I actually quite enjoyed it, but it didn't live up to the original movie. What I really enjoyed about that one was the darker elements that came with it. It stood out compared to other fantasy films, such as this one, with this being too bright and colorful, both visually and story-wise.  Anyway, that's just my two cents.
