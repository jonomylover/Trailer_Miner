She was educated at the Community Montessori School from 18 mos. until 10 years old, when she moved to New York to pursue her career as an actress-singer. Inspired by her sister, Abigail, she began vocal training at the age of 3 and acting at 5 when she began performing. She was discovered at the age of 10 and began training as a professional actress-singer, when she moved to New York to accept the role of Matilda in Matilda the Musical on Broadway.  Since then, she and her sister created a series of concerts and cabarets at 54 Below to support the Anti-Bullying Movement. She was then cast as Sally Brown in the first off-Broadway all-youth production of You're A Good Man Charlie Brown. Charlie in Hereditary was her first film role and she is equally passionate about both mediums. She continues working on her craft and feels that there will always be something to learn.

2018-06-11T01:50:56,"Ok. Watched the movie tonight.  Who said it was scary?  Not the trailer.   This is not the exorcist and it never claimed to be.   If your looking for all kinds of childish jump scares and to be grossed out forget it.  That‚Äôs for the kiddies.  If your looking for a thought provoking drama/ horror / about the demise of this family you will enjoy this film. It is a a story at a slow burn.  Not for those who can‚Äôt concentrate for more than 2 minutes without looking for their cellphone.  Ok. So it has a horror feel.  The anticipation of what the hell is going on and what is going to happen next just might keep your heart racing.  I loved this film. I would call it more of a psychological supernatural thriller/drama along the lines of the shining, which was not scary at all.  If your looking for Friday the 13th forget it.  This is nothing at all like those kind of idiotic horror movies.  This is for adults.  It can be shocking. You will feel some anxiety for sure. It is beautifully filmed with a fantastic performance by Toni Colette .  You will have to make your own decision on what the ending means to you. It‚Äôs thought provoking.  This poor family. Makes you think about what not to mess with in life. Be scared and be shocked. Be amazed and sink down in your seat and enjoy the ride but be prepared to think about this film for a while at night in your dreams.

Close to the ending there are lots of nudity in it which i wasn't aware of which made me mad and made my stomach turn. The movie didn't make much cents unless you see the ending or look online and read about it which i did (it still didn't make much cents). Its not really a scary movie its more as disturbing in my opinion. To be truthful the trailer seems more scary then the actual movie. I went to watch it for my Birthday and i regret it. Its was a ok movie but i wanted to be scared which never really happened. In my opinion this movie was disturbing, unsettling, a little scary but thats all. Disappointed regarding the shocking aspect and the actual thrilling scary moments in current horror movies. i started to like horror movies but I feel so bored with it.

Seriously was sooo slow until the last like 15 minutes which were more hilarious than anything else. I get the exposition was intentionally slow to build tension but it just didn't do it well in my opinion. Also, I love psychological and atmospheric horror and no, I don't have attention problems and followed the movie just fine. Was pretty straight forward. I can see where it would maybe be unsettling for people that spook easily or believe in hell and demonic stuff (I don't, just seems childish and silly).  I thought it was just okay at best and didn't do anything special to make it good. However, the comment section is filled with people raving about how scary it is and is the best horror film ever.

2018-09-10T13:55:40,"I have an observation that may cause any sensible woman to cross the street opposite me once I reveal it.  Toni Collette is an attractive woman.  That's a benign enough a statement.  Yeaaaah, well, don't get too settled.    She manages to do, or perhaps just has the genetic fiber to pull off something that I have never seen done.   I have not seen this demonstrated in cinema, nor have I seen this demonstrated in reality.  This is a perceptual shake-up that threw me off my horse for lack of anticipation.   The aesthetic of terror and rage never deviate from a grotesque arrangement of muscles tissue and skin contour.  Distress draws vitality out of a face,  and fear dries up what remains of it.  Collette manages to improve her beauty index throughout the movie as her face contorts with sheer horror.  Is this a director's slight-of-hand?  I'm not confident that camera angles and lighting can bestow a cosmetic lift in the throws of panic and anguish.  Yet this happens over and over again in the movie.  You see her go from a tranquil appealing look, to becoming aghast with a greater seduction.     If this was done by design, bravo, there are magicians on set.  However this is something very new to me.   It is perplexing from a biological standpoint.  How would fear or rage ever be conducive to courtship?  I know this bit creepy but I must report what I see, especially if they are new to my psyche.  Now if you'll be so kind as to excuse me, I must apply my clown makeup as I sharpen my knives to scratchy violin music.",0,0,Leopard-King,YHxcDbai7aU,0.07139037433155081,2018-09-10 13:55:40,False,False

Maybe I'm jaded by the tens of thousands of horror movies I've seen, but  this is pretty far down the list as far as horror movies go.   It comes after 'it comes at night' from this newer studio,  which also tried to be a psychological thriller.  Both left me yawning knowing exactly what was coming the entire time. hereditary tried to be a psych. thriller for the first 2/3,  which it wasn't the worst effort ever but for all the hoopla surrounding it we can only conclude there is something very political going on in critic circles,  and for some reason they decided this studio must succeed.   The last third inexplicably turned into a 'jump scare fest' that failed miserably at that.  In the end we see where the hereditary part comes in as the demon is named,  only for the second time in the movie.   No backstory,  no explanation went we should give a crap what happens to these characters.    Just a lot of bad,  stiff acting with no depth of character and jump scares you can see coming from 10 miles.  Overall extremely disappointing after the critical acclaim,  2/10.

Listen, I know most horrors use mental disease as an underlying theme but I feel like this movie overdid it in a way that does even more damage to our society's already ignorant attitude toward mental illness. Also, the plot, my God, you get bored long before it starts to make sense, and until then it's just mental abuse.

It tries to give a exorcist mixed with shining vibe , but the end ( as with most movies these days ) gives you no breathing space  Its just bam bam bam one weird violent thing after the other.   I have no idea whats in the mind of people that make this crap . There is no redeemable artistic value what so ever . Especially dealing with the sensitive topic of the death of a child. Even after the violent death of Charlie, i thought the movie might take an interesting turn and maybe the family has visions of things as a way to cope . No. Nope . Just devolves into supernatural horror and gore scenes with some very dopey weird satanism thrown in.  No wonder this country is so f'd up and we have nut jobs like Alex Jones saying Hollywood is satanic . Its obviously not , but when this garbage is put out there, it brings out the religious wackos¬†.¬† ¬†  I remember watching a movie as a kid called "" don't look now "" with Donald Sutherland¬† . After they find their daughter had drowned , it just filled me with sadness and blackness as a kid . Then the movie went into that supernatural crap .

It does nothing good for your mind .¬†  If you are young , its hard to get but life and happiness are things to treasure. Trust me .
