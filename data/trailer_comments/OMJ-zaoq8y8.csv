Something like a more light-hearted version of Trick R Treat (2007 film) or something like Jumanji meets Crimson Peak! I once wrote a treatment/mini-script for a Goosebumps movie some years ago that had an original concept but still payed homage to classic Goosebumps stories. The story/plot centered around of a group of young teenagers including a 6 year old boy,who is the little brother of the only girl of the group, who venture into the infamous woods of a fictional small sleepy town in either Massachusetts or Washington State on Halloween Night, that is told to be haunted due to the many disappearances of children who've entered into those woods. When they enter the woods, they encounter a mysterious, eerie old mansion where they are greeted a mysterious yet eccentric inventor/magician who entraps them in his sick and twisted game where they are forced to go through and survive a series of dimensions/levels that included many supernatural horrors, perils and evils in-order to escape and reclaim their freedom... If they can.  Another way I would've went with the story is that when the group of kids encounter and enter the mansion, they stumble across an ancient book in the library of the abandoned mansion and just like the actual upcoming movie, they open the book and release all the terrors and perils in the book that spread throughout the town.  That's the way I would've gone with the story if I was the director/screenwriter but that's just me! That is just my vision!The tone of my Goosebumps movie would've been a little more darker, spookier, and more intense yet still for the whole family to enjoy!

But it better have at least one Horrorland Horror. I say this because, aside from being my personal favorite Goosebumps creation, it is a major fan favorite. So much so that Stein decided to write a sequel, and then a Horrorland-centric series, it has been the subject of two video games, a board game, and a Tiger handheld game. It is a major icon of Goosebumps, and in a movie where they ""release all"" of R.L. Stein's creations, it needs a Horror.

The Yeti rampages but the recapture it in the book showing how to capture the escaped monsters. However the two boys get curious and release another monster. This time its Slappy. Slappy releases all the other monsters.  The rest of the movie is just hijinks going around recapturing all the monsters. Probably with some corny jokes and a moral thrown in.
