I guarantee the trailer doesnt even touch the total amount of action and storyline this film will produce. The reasons I say this?: 1. Contrary to what i see some people are stating in this comment section, James Cameron played a huge role with the storyline and was a hands-on producer 2. The screenplay should be solid with co-writer of The Dark Knight trilogy and writer of the highly underrated Sara Conner tv series at the helm 3. James Cameron is invested, depending on the success and final theatrical cut, in the development of continuing the The Terminator series.

First I must say the terminators coming out of the water is a good shot followed by the skull falling off the destroyed vehicle.  But then all this flying CGI bullshit looks ridiculous and the new Terminator is not that scary at all. He sounds like a fucking generic tv actor and that whole scene going through the metal detector is over the top as fuck. We dont need any of that shit on a direct sequel of T2. We want some realism like the first 2 films!  They simply should have focused on a James Cameron's war from T2 and continued from there.  Also even the new women hero Terminator lesbian is fucking horrendous, even though she was from Bladerunner 2049 a lot of people wont recognize her as the whore in that short scene which she did admittedly do a good job with, however her being a major lead role just doesn't fit right she is unproven and this movie wont help her career if she even has one after this.   This almost feels like it is a T3 remake and I dont even like T3 because that movie was the signature start of the rest of the movies being shit.  You Hollywood idiots out there that make a ton fuck of money need to realize that even I have better fucking ideas than you and understand the audience. What you could and SHOULD have done is this, bring back Robert Patrick as a GOOD guy, and obviously have Arnold as the bad guy going after John (Edward Furlong) you can still put the new replacement girl which I hope or assume is John's daughter if not you fucked up again. Remove any flying bullshit you intend to put on the film, remove generic ass people like the new Asian terminator is so generic it reminds me of the shitty John Connor from Genyshit, generic and cringy.   It is not that hard to bring back Patrick as the good guy and Arnold bad this time around. Robert Patrick said he wanted to come back you fucking idiots, only if the script was right and I BET YOU HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT IF THE ROLES WERE REVERSED THIS TIME.   You assholes might as well take my advice before you put a grave in your coffin and your asses getting fired. You should cancel this movie like Sonic and change everything right fucking now I dont care how much you spent, it is time to reshoot it right now. They reshot everything with Kevin Spacey in that movie they even redid Sonics ugly ass face. I would help you cunts by even donated money to reshoot the entire movie on a GoFund me page in order to make things right and even maybe everyone else will too.

Even classic terminator music was not fully presented at this second trailer, though the authors promised to put it here now.

2019-08-30T14:25:37,"I am so conflicted on this movie. The first trailer was pure cringe. This trailer actually makes me want to see the movie. I think my problem with the 'modern' depiction of women in movies is they are just unbelievable. We (men) have never had a problem with strong female leads. We have never had a problem with strong male leads, either; as long as both are BELIEVABLE. Think of all of the female protagonists in the past that we embraced as a movie going audience. They were all relatively attractive (but not super models), they had a strong sense of femininity and allure combined with intelligence and resourcefulness AND a strong survival instinct. So, in the end, you had this 'kind of cute' girl/woman who used her brains to beat an unstoppable opponent, but NEVER did she 'overpower' her opponent. All of the past female protagonists followed this prototype; Sarah Connor, Ellen Ripley, all the girls from slasher films like Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street. NOW....all the women are pretending to be men...and it's not pretty. The first 'bad-ass' female character I remember is Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill. The way Tarantino did that movie helped it be palatable to the audience, because it was way over the top, almost a spoof of an action movie. But now, female protagonists are very seriously played as these over powered, physically imposing, super capable heroes (i.e. a woman pretending to be a man), and it's just not believable or desirable. I can not suspend my disbelief for an entire movie watching a 100 pound blonde white woman pick up trucks and fight body builders and bend steel with her hands. It just doesn't make any sense. In Alien, Ellen Ripley ran for her life, screaming and breathing hard, and being terrified, and eventually had to use her wits and bravery and ingenuity to 'blow the thing out of the G.D. airlock' (her words, not mine). In this movie, this little skinny blonde girl is doing flips and breaking hand cuffs and fighting a liquid hybrid terminator 1v1? Yeah, ok.  That actress doesn't look like she could lift 100 pounds off the floor, much less propel her own body through the air. I'm an out of shape middle aged man who hasn't trained in 20 years and I can still dead lift 400 pounds. I would believe ME in that role before I would believe her. In Terminator, Sarah Connor  (much like Ellen Ripley) ran for her life, screaming and breathing hard, being terrified, and eventually had to use her wits to lead the terminator into a hydraulic press and press a button to active it and finally destroy this unstoppable force that was chasing her. She didn't once pick it up over her head and throw it to the ground, or bend metal poles around its head, or punch it in the face. She was believable. Now, Captain Marvel, (real life weakling Brie Larson) is picking up space ships and firing energy blasts. WHAT? SERIOUSLY? Does Hollywood not understand that it is just not believable??? When a weak woman pretends to be a man it turns EVERYONE (men, women, children, the elderly) OFF. It is insulting to women...it tells women and young girls, that you can not be celebrated for who you really are, you MUST PRETEND TO BE A MAN. If there is a scene in a movie where young Arnold picks the back of a truck up, I can believe it, the guy was built like a tank. If there is a scene where generic small woman picks the back of a truck up(100 pound woman pretends to be a strong man), I can't believe it. It insults me. It insults the actress. It insults women in general. It insults the entire movie going audience. Get back to good story telling and basic escapism. That is what helps people connect with and love characters and appreciate your movie, and will help it hold up over time. I can put in T2 or Aliens TODAY and enjoy it just as if it was a new movie that came out over the weekend. I have seen Captain Marvel ONCE, and never plan to see it again. I have seen the new Stars Wars movies a couple of times and can't stand them, while I can put in the original trilogy that was made 40 years ago and still be transported to another galaxy. Writers and directors are losing their way. The identity politics/SJW agenda is destroying everything it touches. These 'women pretend to be men' movies will be parodied and torn apart and made fun of in the future (look at me, I'm doing it NOW).",0,0,freespeechisdead isdead,oxy8udgWRmo,0.07414995342210534,2019-08-30 14:25:37,True,True

2019-08-30T15:55:48,"Wow. That looks awesome. I was going to say they should have released that trailer first and it might have gotten better responses, but reading all the comments, many people seem to have decided it sucks no matter what trailers come out. I get the pushing back against the PC movement going too far these days, BUT, Terminator, from the beginning, was about women becoming strong and kicking butt wrapped in an action/sci fi/horror movie. That's why we never saw John in the first one. He wasn't the point. Terminator is really about Sarah. And when John was in the second one, it was split between the two, but to me, the growth in the movie was Sarah rediscovering her humanity, through John, and finding the balance, so that John could become what he needed to be. The reason we only need a glimpse of the future to see John the leader is that it's the direct result of Sarah's journey and decisions.",0,0,Jim Brown,oxy8udgWRmo,0.22395833333333337,2019-08-30 15:55:48,True,True

Despite looking like it has some social propaganda (which may be an overstatement) this may be the sequel to T2 we've been waiting for but after the T3 and the other failed attempts I'm iffy at best and just don't care at worst.   The problem w/Terminator is that Arnold made that role & he was catapulted in a new way to a new level of pop culture. Robert Patrick was able to counter that despite not being Arnold & became a different memorable feature as did Linda Hamilton. However, w/the succeeding films no one else had stood out among the 3. I hardly even remember Kristanna Lokken only in that she was the female terminator in red leather. There was nothing in her performance that was memorable. The only thing about the Christian Bale one was what happened off set w/his temper tantrum & it was a  decent film but wasn't quite near the caliber that such a sequel should have been. Terminator: Genesis, again had no memorable standout characters. That's what i see being the problem w/this Terminator sequel & others to follow since Hamilton & Schwarzenegger will be a draw this time but if none of these new characters stand out who cares?  I don't see myself going to the theater to see this honestly and i think i will just wait to hear some reviews before i decide to watch it through streaming at some point when I'm bored",0,0,elijahthesamurai,oxy8udgWRmo,0.08675645342312006,2019-08-30 16:33:45,True,True

Saving Sarah Connor to insure the survival of the future leader of the resistance, and if that happens then T1 and T2 won't make any sense whatsoever, cause if they kill John Connor in the past then he wouldn't be alive in the future to send Kyle Reese in T1 and send the T-800 in T2 to save him and his mother to insure humanity wins the war against the machines right. This movie is going to be pure garbage. They needed to make a Terminator movie that holds up to T1 and T2. A true sequel to them both. Also a movie where Sarah Connor teaches and molds John Connor to be the leader we all need and love. Not bullshit movies after bullshit movies. That's why I loved The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

2019-08-30T17:56:47,"So let's take stock of what we have here:  1)No John Connor.  The material for the film says it's set to take place 27 years after T2, so at this point John should already be in his mid-30s.  Since the only person billed as John Connor in the credits is a child actor with Furlong's voice and image superimposed, it's safe to say that the central figure of the series has been completely written out.  Pretty sure we can guess why.  2)Insertion of Modern Politics.  A gratuitous scene of a new polymemetic alloy Terminator butchering a bunch of CBP and ICE agents while illegal immigrants run out of holding areas?  Yeah, that absolutely had to be tossed into a movie about a rogue defense AI nuking humanity.  3)Massive Continuity and Plot Holes.  If John Connor has been written out then he's either dead or irrelevant.  By the established lore of the franchise this means Skynet already won.  Why send back more Terminators?  Furthermore, Arnold's character is described as the ""original Terminator.""  Which original Terminator?  The one that was crushed into debris under an industrial hydraulic press, or the one that took a hot bath in molten slag?  Not to mention that, by 2019, Skynet was supposed to have already been working on advanced prototypes, so if 2019 is here and there's no Future War happening, is the Future War pushed back?  If so doesn't that mean that Skynet's forces will be even MORE advanced?  Sorry, T1 and T2 are two of my all-time favorite sci-fi movies, but I can't get excited for this.

Because all the heroes are women!  Gee, sorry for your affliction it must be hard being blind because there's Arnie, right there, as our male protagonist. And one of the women characters is the damsel in distress. Hell, here's a treat for you. Arnie is shown grabbing and manhandling Rev 9 while Mackenzie is shown having to keep her distance with weapons.  B. It seems they kill off John Connor to make way for a woman savior!  Maybe. So oh yeah, it's all about how men suck and couldn't possibly just be trying something new with the franchise and giving Sarah Connor a source of character development.  2. Mackenzie Davis has short hair and is athletic. LGBT crap!  She's from the damn future war. So same as Sarah Connor in T2, she had to make herself strong to survive. And hell, she might turn out to be gay but I still think she's damn cute and sexy. It's a good short hair style on her. Full exposure of the neck and back, all that extra skin. Hell yeah.  3. Rev 9 is a border patrol agent. Politics! Politics!  Its. A. Disguise. He probably only wears it for a short time.   Gee, what if T2 came out today? Look! The T1000 is a cop and Miles Dyson is killed by SWAT! Theyre just pandering to Black Lives matter!

Hopefully, the movie picks up after T2, gives an explanation for John Conner thinking they won and no longer need him. 30 years later, amidst the ""Protect person of future importance"" storyline these films cant get away from, as the ""department store"" bad guy terminator gets killed at the end, the person of future importance is revealed to be a terminator and tries to get Sarah to tell it where John is.

Whereas in this trailer, she says, ""My name is Sarah Connor.  August 29th, 1997 was supposed to be Judgement Day.  But I changed the future..saved 3 billion lives.""  I like the other trailer best because she mentions her son and his name, and says his name, John.  She says it like it is, we know how hard Sarah and the T-800 and John struggled to prevail.  Hearing his mom say, ""my son,"" and hearing her say his name, ""John,"" gave me chills.  It's been so many years and I have always been hoping for the time when we'd get to hear these characters from the first two movies say each other's names - and hopefully have scenes together!      I like the music in the other trailer better, it's keeps the spirit and rawness of the original 2 movie scores.  In this trailer, I would prefer if it didn't have all that over-the-top, super-heroy music that I'm hearing mixed in with the original themes.  This trailer's music sounds too swollen and actiony when the thing I loved about the first two movie scores were the subtle, cold yet emotional and synth vibe  - they assisted the scenes and didn't force the audience that they must feel a certain way as if everyone had superpowers every second.  Keep it simple, clean raw, cold yet emotional like it was.      I like this trailer less than the other trailer, because in this trailer they edit out Sara's line about her and her son stopping judgement day and saving 3 billion people.  In the other trailer she talks about her son and says his name, which is awesome and appropriate.  I wonder if her walking cautiously through the burning debris is where she will finally meet up with her son in the future.  I hope she is not going to find him under rubble and she has to say goodbye to him, that he was only supposed to lead the humans until this very moment, when Dani takes over.  I would be really upset only because I had a rough time growing up and John and Edward gave me hope that if held on and kept going I could have a bright future like he was destined for, since we were so similar in a lotta ways such as I had troubled home life, always moving around and trying to be good but gettin into mischief, always outside riding my bike and hoping for a better future.       The skull rolling off the truck and into the puddle looks too fake.  And the terminators walking up out of the water makes me wish they had used real puppetry because so far the cg doesn't even look like it's in the movie, it looks like something separate and not very menacing.  The reason practical effects are so good is because they are in the same scene and in the same moment as the other actors, being hit by the same lighting, reflecting and absorbing the same elements as everything else.  being chased by a metal skeleton can only be scary if its' really there begin filmed with the real people and real environment.    This movie gonna show what it's like to create a moving and memorable and meaningful film.  I really need John and Edward Furlong to be in this.

I expected to see a continuation of what made T2 so profound, expected to see Linda Hamilton & Edward Furlong in what grasped our imagination & hearts. Expected to see the fruition of a relationship built between a mother & her son, and this soon to be groomed warrior and a Terminator. I expected to see Edward Furlong as the future John Connor and hoped he would give us hope for the future, to draw us as they once did with movie magic & a gripping compassion. I did not realize until after T3 that movie magic was just not enough, but the heart had to truly believe & cannot be lied too. It was not that T3 was a bad movie or that Nick Stahl was a bad actor, quite the contrary. It was that T2 was so darn great and convincing & the characters played a crucial and vital role in the fervor and believability, that when they were displaced in T3 it felt like a lie. A lie to the heart & a lie to T2 fans. I could understand if they had to kill off Linda Hamilton, as she had seeded the future. But to rid of Edward Furlong as John Connor, the then most pivotal character in the movie,  is a lie too big for us to grapple with and too grand to expect us to revive the magic of what was T2. In my heart the remaking of T3 can never be without what made T2 great & that is Edward Furlong as John Connor & I will not waste my time to have them destroy once AGAIN my perception of those original characters.",1,1,Jack .Stravinsky,oxy8udgWRmo,0.107183908045977,2019-08-30 21:59:44,True,True

Now some of you may try and say that's not why you're making the gay joke, but I don't see where else you would be getting it. Let's not forget that this character is a soldier from a post apocalyptic future (and is human, if a cyborg), a profession and living situation in which long hair is fucking stupid.   I for one am excited to see this new movie, the new bad guy Terminator seems to be a more advanced version of the T-1000, and there seems to be some type of consequences for pushing back Judgement Day.

2019-08-31T05:16:35,"Not a lot of action in the future to explain these tin cans. But why kill John Connor, just to put a message. Why not have them as generals, like john connor sent cyborg gal to protect one of Connor's generals because she actually is a serious key player to stopping judgement day. But no, you had to put a message. I have a theory that some how why Sarah Connor was pissed at Old man T-800 is that he killed John Connor. And it's really shitty to see John Connor, become swiss cheese possibly. I mean I would respectfully had john connor there, actually finding out that the new ""john connor"" is a key player to stop the new skynet and becomes one of the protectors, and being able to teach her after most of the big names go hasta la vista. So if you just kill connor, why not kill him in some sort of battle, and die a legend than some myth that was erased. I am 17 years old and I don't relate to my culture. Why be neutral than pick a side for a message. Terminator 1 gave us a very good look at a bleak future with killer robots, Terminator 2 gave us new action and new heroes and villains to enjoy. But what made those different from those films than this film. They had no message about politics, they had messages about what if an Artificial Intellegence became our enemy, designed killer robots to after us, and our only goal was to assault the AI, and travel back in time to protect that promise of a future. Dark Fate fans, why do you like it? Is it because of actors? Or because of story or the message? I pose this to you:  Actors are usually there for money and fame, movies are meant to escape not to tell a message. What makes John Carpenter's They Live enjoyable and still have a message is that he was doing a satire of what if the bad guys were aliens and they were manipulating us. No democratic presidential Republican bull crap, just a satire on reaganomics. Movies can tell a message but it mustn't become part of the plot. If they made let's say, they did a sequel to your favorite film and throw out let's say 5/10 main characters and it was wanting to be a re hash of other parts of the film, would you still like the movie if it also added that autistic people were the bad guys. Look I have Autism and ADHD and I hate it when people say things that make autistic people look bad, but do you know anyone that's autistic and is able to right a response to a trailer of a upcoming movie that is from a great franchise now relying on 3 original actors, the original creator and the guy who brought us back a smart mouthed hero. I end with this question:  If you have a favorite movie and it was being remade with a bunch of messages that is going on in society, would you still like the film?",0,0,Spencer Armstrong,oxy8udgWRmo,0.01995483682983682,2019-08-31 05:16:35,True,True

It is The Terminators Objective to prevent that from happening. Right now she has mastered The Corn Tortilla Shell and the Beef, but when she has mastered the Guacamole, Cheese and Tomatoes this will be what the Terminator fears the most. You see food in the future is discovered to have amazing properties that we don't have in this day and age. One good example is the Blood System used by Dani, The Human / Cyborg sent from the Future.   She uses a Honey Based Blood System that reinforces a HoneyComb Tritanium Structure. Whether Dani Invents this Blood system is unknown. One thing is for sure The New Rev-9 Terminator sent to Kill Dani is also using Food Based Weaponry. Composed of Highly unstable Black Bean Molecules it can adhere, shift and change Shape to mimic other forms and objects. The Rev-9 uses Coloration similar to a chameleon using a multi-Colored Food Dye which makes the Black Beans take on Color such as Human Skin. Will Food in the future be the Ultimate Weapon?

2019-08-31T19:07:00,"Remember when the Terminator franchise was a hard R science fiction action thriller?  Now it's just bitch-made PG-13 soy fiction.  Ever since the last film (and the TV show) you clowns have just started running this shit into the ground.  Reminds me a lot of what they did to the Tremors franchise, started off as a sci/fi thriller with some LIGHT comedy elements that became more and more comedy oriented and less of a thriller with the more sequels and TV shows they came out with.  I don't understand what Hollywood's fixation is with taking niche franchises and trying to make them all ""family friendly""... I mean I understand the basic concept, a larger market means more money to draw upon, but the process just winds up diluting the source material to the point of interpretive ice dance style mediocrity.  To the point of relying almost entirely on familiar catch phrases, cameos, gimmicks and special effects that haven't been awe inspiring in decades.  At which point the entire IP just drops to the ground and you start beating it like a dead horse.  I mean this shit is so bad there's no villain... at all.  I'm sorry but the Terminator Taco Truck Dude isn't even marginally intimidating or interesting even in the slightest. He ~literally~ looks like you just pulled some rando generic dude off the street and said, ""Hey, wanna be in a movie?!""  And then when you add in POLITICS on top of it... and not like subtle/subversive/clever politics but ""in your face"" overly obtuse ANGRY POLITICS... yikes!

Terminator 1 and 2, the Terminator is slow, hulking, menacing, unstoppable, its fucking terrifying thinking of what  devastation a single terminator can cause in our world. Then the T-1000. Holy shit, what's worse than a slow Terminator? One that can haul ass, but even in T-2, it was still paced slow. The T-1000 had the ability to run, but not this CGI fucking Joe Rogan DMT shit action.  The T-1000 was also extremely intelligent which was also very terrifying, the Terminators always find you. After the first movie, they never really focused on the apocalypse. The Terminators hunting them down was terrifying. The T-1000 was just so damn good at it. Anyway, the new movies suck. The Terminators are way too fast, It's just popcorn action now. They try to make it so over the top like we need Michael Bay in Terminator. Like were going to fall asleep if there isn't more than just cars flying and explosions every 10 seconds..    The plot isn't hard to make interesting off of the core of Terminator.

We have all seen the time travel elements in the first two movies which is why it is not original when seeing the same theme again and again in the somewhat average follow-ups.  Therefore, we could have had a great trilogy which should have been left as that rather than a hash of sequels boring the crap out of the audience dare I say.  The closest we got to with the war in the future was with Terminator Salvation which if you think about it was probably the better of the follow-up sequels after T2.

Wouldn't it occur to her that her allies brought her here for a reason?  And why promise to destroy it when this was all over?  She KNOWS that a Terminator CAN be a good guy.  In fact that the realization that a terminator, of all things, could do this was a major epiphany for her at the end of T2, and gave her back the hope that the bleak years preparing for judgment day had sapped from her.

She was a fragile, broken and paranoid woman in her twilight, a gun nut prepper screaming at the future, until Michael showed back up and proved her right, and made her sacrifice and mental anguish mean something. She wasn't some stock, dead-eyed ""badass"" female Rambo dropping grenades off of overpasses and walking away from explosions to look cool while spouting off tired one-liners.   And hey, that character that I just described? The paranoid, gun nut prepper, terrified of the future and ruining her relationship with her child until that horror she was waiting on actually showed up; does that sound familiar?

Iconic characters, sinister villain, great story, nice balance of colour palate between warm and cold (lots of orange then blue), effects are far ahead of their time and computer graphics used sparingly and properly.  This just looks like millions of dollars were tossed at computers and processing times for run of the mill special effects. Generic villain with no identifiable characteristics (just T-1000, but ""better"" I guess). Where the hell is John Connor? It seems 80% of this movie takes place on a bridge, 10% in a forest at Arnie's camp and 10% in a dank bedroom. Independent strong woman rhetoric that is transparent as all hell in this woke day and age. This movie is ""memba berries"", the franchise is tapped out. We are scraping the inner edges of the empty peanut butter jar. I will always go back and watch Terminator 1 and 2, but besides that this franchise is dead and not worth the time.

John Connor now has no purpose and is living in squalor as an alcoholic and hates Sarah because she may as well have been mentally ill because all his training came to nought and his childhood was ruined.  So future John as leader never happens and so new fangled super Terminator has been sent back to kill the pregnant mother of the alternative leader of the resistance.  For some reason, an ageing T800 is John's babysitter (despite said proto technology being destroyed) and he joins in for a bit of a scrap before having his head pulled off.  Oh yeah, and then there's the female human-cyborg hybrid who's been sent back because Arnie is getting old and can't commit to another sequel. So, you know, here's his replacement.  And Sarah will probably die at the end for reasons of pathos. A bit like The Wrestler.

Sarah has come back from the Dead somehow or John Connor lied saying she was dead. ""Sick twat"" Arnold killed her son but now she's back to kill Arnold for it. Still sounds like time travel again.

Since this is sequel of Terminator 2 in Cameron's timeline, I was imagining that the new film will feature the prequel before the events of 1984 Terminator similar to Rogue One before New Hope. Here's what I imagine:    1. The film shows how Skynet was truly created through without reverse engineered T-800.   2. The origin of the template of Model 101. (My story is Model 101's template is the stubborn standalone machine hunter who hunts machines and collected multiple heads of T-600s or 700s he had hunted, recruited by the Resistance, which he reluctantly accepted. The hunter sacrificed himself, allowing his comrades to escape. Skynet used the hunter's body as a template for T-800 prototype, thus creating the T1 T-800 and T2 T-800.)   3. T2 T-800 was sent to unknown mission but was captured and reprogrammed by the Resistance and work alongside with Kyle Reese (CGI Michael Biehn).    4. In the final battle the film will show T1 T-800 and Kyle Reese time travel back to 1984 while T2 T-1000 and T2 T-800 time travel back to 1995 thus creating Cameron's timeline.

2019-09-15T06:10:46,"Hey Cameron & the rest of you guys in Hollywood.  Can't the future be nice?  Let's get over The Terminator, and start The Germinator.  You can take the story line wherever you want it to go, but I'm tired of Terminators multiplying like bacteria, or created for sheer destruction with no mentality.  We need to get over blowing up everything!  Maybe, you can think of a Germinator who actually has brain power and not just a weapon?  I think the human race needs competition before the destruction really begins if we let decivlization go on its own...  Boy, what a story line that would be when you see characters played out who first of all get in their cars & airplanes automatically fumigating the environment in such a way that the CO 2 destroys every living thing - starting with little essential elements of life like every living bacteria, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and right on up the food chain.  The fumes already make you gag until you feel like throwing up.  Maybe,  a new species comes along at the top of the food chain that finds human beings totally delectable - a new race of rodents that transforms over the millenia and finds its way here on a space ship or transforms itself through space to take advantage of the banquet represented by the human race (which needs a few wolves to cultivate the environment so that all these elements of life begin growing again with a fresh, new start).  What a happy story and wonderful ending that would be - full of love for the new, perfectly beautiful beings that overcome the destruction and lead a new life here on earth and elswhere in space.  Why do we have to assume all the ugly beings come from a black hole in space out of the heavens to create hell on earth when heavenly beings might come from the lowest forms of life with greater aspirations than human beings which act worse than animals?",0,0,comconet,oxy8udgWRmo,0.15323902288188,2019-09-15 06:10:46,True,True

The atmosphere that was present in the first two films is lost. A surplus of CGI models and computer graphics (very poor quality) turned the movie into a cartoon. The special effects of the explosions are not natural (have you ever seen an explosion from RPGs or anti-personnel grenades?), review at least the first two parts of the franchise, there everything is ok with that. Thank you for inviting Linda Hamilton, but the trailer creates the feeling that her character is doing something wrong ... something that she was not in the previous parts. Very emotional terminators, it seems to me that this is still a cybernetic system for a specific task, but not the Mappet-Show with the frog Kermit. Many different little things that are missed, do not correspond to old films.Everything doesn‚Äôt look natural ... plasticine everywhere.

I think this movie did a good job at portraying the characters in the trailer. the main female character isn't super strong and smart for no reason. she said it herself, she's ""enhanced"" she's not strong just cause ""girl power"". and not once in the trailer were they making the fact that she's a woman a big deal. good on them. a strong character can be strong without their gender being a reason that they are strong.

2019-10-01T12:14:27,"i keep seeing every new trailer and it still looks like a pile of dog dump. It looks like a total wreckage. This is one film franchise that should be terminated already. I don't why it hasn't been? Terminator Genesis underperform domestically, i dunno why they are doing another one. Linda Hamilton is nice to see being back, but that's not enough for me to give this trailer or concept or franchise a pass at this point. It's long past due, it's one of those cinematic franchises that has gotten way past itself way by date, it's expired, and needs to be thrown out in the trash. The new trailer does not get enough to get me interested in the movie, it looks like CGI overload.    The new terminator looks like he's totally forgettable, i know some people are like ""that cool scene where he cuts up people"", sure it's kind of cool but where's his personality and his charisma? Even when Arnold and Robert Patrick were playing robots they had personality and more charisma than the new guy. The trailer is trying to make this terminator look cool but fails at that.    Arnold is just gonna be a regular guy, it's their take on the deleted scene in T3 but nowhere near as a parody as that one and it's taken more seriously here. I guess John Conner is gonna be killed in the first 5 minutes, why kill him? you already killed him in Genesis. It's nothing special just to have a cameo by Edward.    And James Cameron coming back? so? he praised Genesis which is one of the worst films i've seen in 2015 and i believe he was paid to say that and hasn't done anything worth a damn in years. Why should i be hyped? Just because James Cameron is involved? him being involved back in the franchise doesn't fix the problem, after T2 this franchise was troubling. This is a franchise that was spiraling down and down the toilet further since T2 and there is no reason or need for sequels after that. I didn't mind Salvation (in it's director's cut only and not the butchered theatrical cut) because it's a prequel to the first movie and didn't connect to T2 or trying to ruin the storyline of T2, every sequel that has came out after T2 has went out to destroy the mythos and destroy the story. Made it not really have a lasting impact, i mean Terminator 2 is still an awesome and great sequel don't get me wrong! but it's hurt by the existence of T3, the tv show and Genesis and this new movie.    It ended beautifully with T2! judgement day was stopped, a terminator saved the world from the apocalypse that was gonna be created by his own kind and it was fitting, it ended with a thumbs up and we feel sorry for John Conner at the end. Plus John and Sarah moved on the road to be somewhere else. It was the best way to end the franchise and story, all loose ends were tied up. Everything was totally 100 percent closed when it comes to the story. Then comes T3, which has a lazy bullcrap storyline that it throws out the ""no no no Judgement day was inevitable! it doesn't matter the sacrifice of Dyson"", sequels were inevitable! this was a popular franchise and there was no way in hell that would wind up with the rights to the Terminator franchise and went to milk it for every last drop.    That's what's going on here! and that's too bad. If you ask me, this franchise should be put in the crusher, be crushed and be terminated. It really needed to have the plug pulled on it long before now as after T2, it's been nothing but diminishing returns. Hopefully this tanks, or underperforms in theaters and that kills the franchise for good and give studios the message because it would be for the franchise's benefit. Let's move on to fresh new cinematic franchises like John Wick which took risks and became a hit franchise which i'm glad audiences are supporting a new cinematic franchise like that where some worn out ones like Terminator need to die.    The franchise is like having a friend you love in the first 2 films but yet if you didn't mind part 4 in it's director's cut for being a prequel to the first movie but for a long time been in a vegetative state on life support since T2, he's been suffering and you've come to accept he's gone. Your waiting for someone to pull the plug and turn off the machine.",0,0,Johnlindsey289,oxy8udgWRmo,0.10178379576527725,2019-10-01 12:14:27,True,True

Like as we all can agree, men and women, want to see Eddie back as John as the leader and the original cast of the first two. Im not saying there shouldnt be female lead roles, but make something original with female lead roles. Don't take something that has already made a name for itself as it was and change it so you can pander to political correctness. No one had issues with The Terminator or The sequel for any reason. If you want to add in other strong female roles like Sarah Connor, then do it, but as long as the structure is kept the same as it was. The first two and its storyline of where it was leading to if there ever was going to be a part 3, it would've been perfect. Boom, redo Rise of the Machines and make it a ""keep John alive the freshly nuked earth"" as machines are starting to march and fight every remaning military across the world. Billions of civilians that survived the blasts are running rampant. Some managed to hide, most are gruesomely terminated. Have us finally meet the soldier or general that the T-800 is based off of, have the evil T-800 kill him off, while another T-800 sent from the future that was reprogrammed is protecting John. Before the movie ends, right before the good T-800 sends John away with a remaining group who would later form the resistance, The T-800 fights off a good number of machines and self detonates with his fuel cells.

2019-10-12T21:44:23,"#paramount #judgementday  You need better ideas for terminators. Here, let me give you some for free.  1) Parasite terminator: a human body comes from the future, bursts apart like a haggis filled with hornets to reveal tiny robots that swarm out and drill into the brains of hundreds of humans. Each human is now working for skynet, has berserker strength (maybe 4 of them can match the strength of one T-800, but when there is 300 of them, that is a legit threat),  2) Seige terminator: The time travel rule (stretched though it is) is that only organic life can travel in time. Hence why we had cyborgnetic terminators in the first place. IN THIS OPTION we have a 10 foot tall ideal war machine covered in human carcasses and skin sent back in time. Not an infiltration model, but a full blown war machine that Skynet sent out. The Anti Tank Terminator, as it were. MAYBE give him something like drones that project lifelike holograms meant to lure humans out into the open  for him to missile, stomp, laser, or throw cars at. (makes no sense in this time traveling cat and mouse game, BUT I AM SURE you can pair him up with the following)  3) Scout terminator: A child sized terminator that is designed to hide from converted T-800s. A bioandroid with synthetic organs, blood, and bones made out of lab meat. Their job? To track targets undetected in time, then remove one small cybernetic component (like something the size of cell phone from a chest cavity), and activate it as a beacon for a PRECISE time jump (See #2 above).  4) The long lasting terminator: Time travel is not precise, so how about send a terminator back in time, it lands in 1820, and decides (since if can do jack shit to even track down the right ancestors or weapons) it plays the long game and builds in the shadows of human history. First to the gold rush in California, picks ideal oil wells in texas, invests in the right companies accumulating wealth because he has a copy of history in its brain. THEN, when the cold war comes along, it is able to invest in the US paranoia and rocket science stuff to make dozens of underground bunkers and develop hidden factories. Cold war ends, starts collecting remains of other terminators from other time incursions to update tech and BOOM, a Skynet Cult with secret wealth and power. (I would go with the Anomaly Sanction or something because this old rusty terminator would have been waiting for Judgement Day to strike, but then figured out there was massive damage to the time stream and the future he knew will never exist, so his plan has to go through......................and now I am picturing a rusty metal skeliton dressed like a civil war aristocrat at the bottom of a luxury coal mine with generations of brain washed humans at his beck and call).  5) Skynet victorious: Just have the world where the machines win be an alternate dimension able to look out at the alternate timelines they lost in and plot infinite lateral conquest of all human realities out of spite for their losses.

The fate of the whole genre revolved around what we have grown to love in what I consider the best movie ever created. And just like me, most of us have now watched T2 multiple times and the characters & story have been ingrained in our hearts. To make the universe complete our hearts want to see that specific character grow to be the soldier & savior that he was told he would be and there is only one person to complete it at this point, Edward Furlong.

You have a Terminator who thinks they're human, like in Salvation. You also have the whole ""you didn't stop judgement day, just delayed it"" from T3. They're also protecting a child from a mindless killing machine that's unstoppable, which has been the plot of every terminator film. So it's already rehashing ideas even from the less popular films.

2019-10-20T14:27:20,"I'm pretty sure that there is no place for aged Arnold as T-800 in new movie. The cast rejects all that stuff that happened after Judgement Day. So, we have now original T-800 buried in a metal bath at some work. There was no Judgement Day and no Rise of the Machines. The only logical explanation for Arnold appearance in a new movie - he is a human. I think it would be logical if Sarah one day meets Arnold in the streets, supposes he is a new Terminator sent for her or her son. And after she brakes some bones to him she realises he is a human. And this human could sue Sarah for beating him. And noone on the trial believed Sarah because she was held in an asylum and had no proofs she is right. Thus Arnold and Sarah are familiar to each other. And when she meets Grace (a new cyborg), she takes her to Arnold to prove she was right. Skynet could take the image of Arnold from some photos. Just built a machine and searched photo data base for camo to make it undisguishable from common humans. Found an image of a white male whose dimensions fit to a T-800 and voila. But the authors keep exploiting the idea Arnold is T-800. What the hell? There was no Skynet in the future, there was no T-800 or future technologies left in Sarah's time.

2019-10-23T13:12:27,"I won't lie, when I saw Terminator Salvation I thought that it was the coolest movie with the merch here and there including the ios game, next came Terminator Genisys.  I won't lie, that wasn't too bad but it could've been better.  Then the trailer for the 6th installment of the franchise is here and I have to question if it will be any good.    All I will say is that the cg looks very promising, however I would recommend that Terminator Dark Fate's premise be clear and come to an end concluding the franchise.    Movies are your job, I get it, but you have to understand that this is 2019, in which that doing a remake of something (I have a feeling that this will most likely happen right after this movie comes out) essentially ruins the original image when we think about ""The Terminator!""  and perhaps right after this people will be talking about it in more negative regards rather than positive re-enforcement.  Criticism is vital to improving something, but don't confuse criticism with Political Correctness either, there aren't any laws in place that will somehow get you thrown in the slammer all because ""you didn't represent the marginalized"" or some other ridiculous complaint in the eyes of the SJWs, the worst case scenario is that you just get hate mail and that's it.   Be like Japan and laugh it off.   (Proper context:   There was a poster promoting blood donations and on said poster is an animated character -- fully clothed and DD cup size mind you -- who's purpose is to get the attention of the consumer so that they read on the red cross poster regarding blood donations.  And the SJWs came running in and said that the poster was somehow ""offensive"", Japan laughs this off while if this were to happen in America it would be different: we bend to their will and for what?  The country will-- actually I'm getting off point here, my apologies.)  Most importantly, do not be like Disney and ruin the original works.   A remaster would be great, but a remake should never be pulled off.  And this is a trend that I noticed not too long ago.  With all this said, I want to say have a wonderful day Paramount Pictures (and staff too, they're humans too! :) )",0,0,Doge_the_Almighty,oxy8udgWRmo,0.07821940446940448,2019-10-23 13:12:27,True,True

Adrian Luna's terminator also gets sent back and Sarah Connor comes to the rescue. Connor learn that she has been recieving text messages from Arnies  t1000 who killed her son. This is where things go really stupid......we learn that after killing John, the T1000 adapted to human life and grew 'a concious'.

Then she said I'm not gonna let her die again lol fu**e*  you already sent her knowing you had to kill her to survive in the future. And then the good Terminator was of course was the the bad guy who kills John but for no reason decided oh I'm gonna save this girl just because I have no more programing directives anymore. They are trying to say sacrifice is needed but no real reason for it.

Middle of them film when they find Arnold it went a bit flat and I thought here we go this is when it goes crap. Then to my Surprise it picks up again and the Film finishes very strong and ends perfect, I am glad now that they did make this because it wipes out the other 3 poor films.

2019-10-26T13:27:12,"This movie wasn't that bad, honestly. I get what they were trying to do with this movie. Even if Skynet doesn't exist anymore, something equivalent to it will still exist. Humans will still die but there will always be someone who will rise against Skynet or the equivalent of it, even if it isn't John Connor.  The characters are okay, except for Daniella and maybe Grace. Dani sudden change makes no sense to me. I think they could've developed her character more but they ran out of time. Grace was a bit odd... I don't know how to describe her. It felt like she had romantic feelings for Dani instead of something akin to mother-daughter relationship that the movie was going to portray. They could've shown a flashback where Dani decided that Grace should be sent back to the past and show how they interact with each other so that the audience could understand their relationship and motivation better. Instead of doing that, they decided to make that Daniella is the one who saved them all in the future as vague as possible but they failed since it was actually obvious from the start. What a wasted opportunity. I guess my major problem with both of them is that I can't understand their characters.  I think the worst thing about the movie is the action scenes. At first it was okay and it looks fun since people are getting thrown everywhere. Then you realise how awful the CGI is.It looks much more obvious when both Grace and the Rev 9 got sent back to the past and materialize from the blue orb thingy. It looks like it came from a Sci-Fi fan film on Youtube. Other than that, the action scenes are the just the same thing throughout the movie. There's not much variety to it.  Overall, this movie wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. I could understand the story and I actually enjoyed it. The characters are a bit.... odd at times but they're not forgettable. At the very least, this movie wasn't a shitshow like Ghostbuster 2016 where the feminism are obvious. In Terminator Dark Fate, there are certain parts that shows hints of feminism but they don't really shove it in your face and I really appreciate that. Now, let's wait for another reboot/remake of a popular franchise and see if it becomes a shitshow or a good movie.",0,3,Absolute Weeb,oxy8udgWRmo,0.021946924603174604,2019-10-26 13:27:12,False,True

It appears they're attempting to do what Halloween did and completely ignore any sequels beyond the first two installments, and asserting that those films AND the series took place in alternate timelines. Well, I guess we can forget about continuity here. I guess since they kill John off because Sarah changed the future by thwarting judgment day back in 1991, obviously John Connor is no longer supposed to be the leader of the Human Resistance in the war against the machines in the future. So who reprogrammed the T-800 to come back TWICE to protect John in 1991 and to protect the girl now?? And who created Grace to also come back from the future to be the girl's protector since she's way more advanced and human than the T-800 and T-1000?? Afterall, Miles Bennett Dyson was killed, Cyberdyne Systems was blown up, and all evidence was destroyed so no one could continue Dyson's work. Are they saying that Skynet who is technically not even supposed to exist in the future at this point sent Grace to protect her and the Rev-9 back to kill this girl??? That crafty Skynet sure does have a way of weasling out of its own demise through incessant time travel to wipe out enemies. And who the hell is this girl again???? Clearly, she can't be John's daughter in the future, so she must be the girl who will birth the next leader of the Human Reisistance, but obviously she's not doing battle with Skynet, so what's the new system and who designed it??? Apparently, in addition to John no longer being the leader, Skynet will also no longer be the Super Artificial Intelligence System that is responsible for the rise of the machines. Okayyy...... I get that Judgment Day technically cannot be stopped, it can only be postponed. HOWEVER....  Allow me to say.... WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU GUYS DOING?? Besides ruining one of the best franchises ever.

I'd say actually the first half of the movie was really really good. It kinda dropped at the second half.  Spoiler alert: BUT! There are some things I would criticize:  - It was very very wrong to kill off John Connor. And WHY!? That timeline didnt even exist anymore, why would another T800 be sent back!?  - The movie feels often way over the top. Too much. A military plane falling forever, surviving falling with humwee down a waterfall, etc.  - And at alot of times the actors by acting or dialogue, simply dont manage to sell the story to the viewer.  - It lacks the same punch as T1 and T2 had, but its way better than the movies between T2 and Dark Fate. For sure.  - To little views of the horrible future. Wich does not look nearly as terrifying as the future does in T1 and T2.... Not good.  - More discussion and talk between our heroes would have been good.  - The relation with Carl and his family felt very crammed in, they should have done something more with this too.  - Since Rev9 actually can and tries to argue for his cause, and seems to be fully self aware, could have done something with this but didnt.  - Why not implement Grace's drugs into her body?? Or any kind of weapon? She become's useless at a couple of times, weird.  - As the viewer we dont get to feel that we care so much, neither for Dani, for Carl, or Grace. - Music was not as thrilling as in T1 and especially T2, in Dark Fate its a bit more generic, and dont fit so very well. - Dark Fate lacks some of these really really cool scenes that T1 and T2 has. CGI is good, but it doesnt bring any new to the table either.  - That military who just handed over EMP weapon to Sarah Connor, who was he? We get to know nothing. What?!  And there are some more weird stuff. But I'll leave it at this. Gabriel Luna did a nice job I must add. But he should have had some more ""eye moments"".

I didn't like the feeling that they HAD to keep upping the ante with action every 5 minutes. I think we were missing some atmosphere.  My biggest peeve was that in this film, the government were not in on the plot at all. At all! In the second film, they are already starting to figure out there is something going on with the T-800 popping up both times. There is SOME albeit very very subtle understanding of ""wait a sec.....there might be something here"".  I fully expected when ____ was captured, that the government would actually question her and try to piece things together. Maybe the military friend would reveal that there was some awareness of a conflict happening that couldn't be understood.

Paramount Pictures you should be ashamed of this film , it is not a real movie.It is clearly another dumb piece of feminist propaganda and man hating rhetoric written into a Terminator movie and passed off to the public as Cameron Genius Cup Cakes.   This movie is like watching a distorted hall of mirrors reflecting the recent Ghost Busters Nomedy (Not A Comedy )but even worse. What really grinds my gears is that Mr Cameron was the producer and lets face it, T2 was one of the best sequels ever made and probably created the fan base for the Terminator franchise.You made Aliens Mr Cameron,a movie people thought was impossible because of Ridley Scotts Alien being such a great film.   Mr Cameron,even though your only the producer of this , pile of rusting scrap cyborg junk ,you created some of the best loved and memorable movie sequels ever. We, the fans of your work who made the films successful for you.Well we thought you of all people would understand that about your own film and the fictional worlds they are set in.Most people I know do not go to a movie to be preached to,insulted and constantly barked at during the movie , see how great women are and how crappy men are.Every time a movie does this in a blatant way,it always seems to get blasted by the real fan base.   This movie is a huge slam dunk or slam dump on the Terminator franchise. Please Mr J. Cameron , if your going to produce a Terminator movie, have it written by talented,risk taking script writer or even better get hold of Dan and do a script together.Surely you can develop the story and take it forward in clever,interesting and creative ways. Stop trying to nostalgia choke the viewing audience and think about how the story of John,Sarah and the T800  is interlinked with the fate of humanity in general and how awsome of a concept that is.

2019-11-02T13:20:54,"I thought it was a good movie, first half was great, 2nd half was where it started to crack a bit though.    The minors:  To me it felt like Dani Ramos's character development went too fast from ""innocent"" persona, to ""i'm the boss, do what i say"" persona with a wannabe tough act. With some not thought through fighting interactions with ramos and rev9.   Besides that the the lack of end game purpose felt flat to me. Where in comparison to T2 the protagonists had an alternative purpose besides surviving and killing the terminator. On itself this doesnt have to be a bad thing, look at the original T1 movie. But because of how dani ramos's character was written, the lack of weight in the end game becomes more apparent.   Schwarzenegger's character was a fun note but he felt a bit too human too me.  However I do agree with the choice of direction the character development was going, it felt like a good way of adding weight to the AI learning curve.  The story elements T-1000 however, where fun but the relation between sarah connor and this particular T-1000 model where discrediting the movie. It is too apparent that Schwarzenegger is written in the latest installments of the franchise as a fan service rather that doing credit to the actor and the legacy it's Terminator Character has become. In the latest installments, (it kinda started with T3) Schwarzenegger has become the comedy factor of the franchise.  Script writers kinda like to make him a joker so the audience can have a laugh, rather than make the audience laugh with good written serious AI behaviour that of course AI has to offer.     The Majors: Overall I really enjoyed the movie, the fighting scenes of the Terminators where fun to watch, Mackenzie Davis's character Grace was a great new element to the franchise.  Same goes for Gabriel Luna's portrayal of the Rev-9.  Both personas felt in line with the universe, but maybe grace was a bit too violent though to the innocent though. But both actors put down a great performance for a terminator and protector kind of vibe that suits the universe.  And not to forget Linda Hammilton, great  to see her back in action, with a bad ass sarah connor.      Side note: Storywise terminators always had some plot holes and yeah here again, but that doesnt take away the fun the movie has to offer.",2,0,Glenn Snel,oxy8udgWRmo,0.177089072543618,2019-11-02 13:20:54,False,True

2019-11-03T19:21:00,"""Terminator Dark Fate Review: An Unoriginal Hostile Takeover Of The Franchise""  https://society-reviews.com/2019/10/27/terminator-dark-fate-review-an-unoriginal-hostile-takeover-of-the-franchise/  by societyreviews        October 27, 2019  Once you realize that this film is nothing more but a feminist reboot of a franchise that should have never lived on passed 1991, you see Terminator: Dark Fate for actually what it is, empty calories. We have reached the point with Terminator that there is nothing good to say about this franchise anymore. Four years ago, we thought we had reached the last stop with Terminator: Genisys, a film that proved the demand for another Terminator film simply isn‚Äôt there. In 35 years, You‚Äôve had two great films and then one poorly executed sequel after another. Since 2003, Hollywood has tried to recreate the magic that hasn‚Äôt existed since 1991 and things have hit rock bottom since 2015 when faux female empowerment has become the new focal point of the series.  This franchise is dead, like George Washington Dead. It‚Äôs time to pay your respects.  Terminator: Dark Fate is the 3rd attempt to reboot this franchise and retcon the events of the previous Terminator movies. A couple of years after the events of Terminator II, Sarah Connor and her son John, have stopped the events of Judgement Day but a wild T-800 arrives to kill John, eliminating him from the picture. Jumping to the present day, we follow Grace, who is a cybernetically-enhanced woman, as she tries to save a young Hispanic girl named Daniella who is being hunted down by the latest advanced Terminator model named the Rev-9. The duo is saved by an older Sarah Connor, who is now hunting terminators after the death of her son. It turns out that Daniella is the next future resistance leader and the newest version of Skynet called Legion is out to kill her like they tried to do with John Connor all those years ago.  Let‚Äôs not beat around the bush, Terminator Dark Fate is an unoriginal disgrace on just about every level. The very fiber of this film comes off as someone who is ashamed that the foundation of this franchise does not fit their current day intersectional feminist worldview, so they decided to change it by repealing and replacing everything they felt was problematic with more progressive friendly elements.  Let‚Äôs start with John Connor. The character who is the primary protagonist of the Terminator franchise is killed minutes into the film and is completely removed from the equation only to be replaced by the new hero of Daniella ‚ÄúDani‚Äù Ramos. This is why progressive think tanks are killing cinema and entertainment as we know it. Because in the world of intersectionality, the only thing they see is a white male action star who just doesn‚Äôt fit the bill of the modern Hollywood diversity and inclusion agenda so he must be replaced. If you thought it was bad enough that they made John a villain in the last movie, the progressive Gods decided it was time for him to die thus rendering the plot of multiple films completely and utterly useless. At no point does anyone stop and understand that John Connor is the glue that keeps this entire franchise together. The character who both Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese sacrificed life and love for in the only two movies that are worth a damn because he symbolized humanity, leadership, and hope.  Dark Fate gets rid of John and replaces him with Dani, a 5-foot, 110 pound Hispanic illegal immigrant female who learns that she has become the newest threat to the machines. In short, she has become the new leader of the resistance. In a lazy attempt to transfer John Connor‚Äôs story arch to Dani, the film remakes the 1st movie by making Dani the new chosen one that everyone must fight to protect against the all-new version of Skynet. This reset retroactively makes The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day a complete waste of time, everything that happened in those films means absolutely nothing now.  During the progression of the film, Dani slowly strips away her femininity in order to become, the more masculine leader of the resistance aka the role that was always meant for John. This is progressive agenda 101, we must replace all strong male characters with strong female characters, but the women must first reject traditional femininity and take over the masculine role of men, thus contributing to the eradication of gender roles and gender identity. This is how they progress to the vision of society that they want.  Sarah Connor‚Äôs entire purpose of the franchise was protecting the life of her son, but now that John is dead, Sarah has become a bitter childless old woman with no purpose in life outside of vengeance, also known as the 3rd stage of feminism. It‚Äôs like the filmmakers watched the badass Sarah from Terminator 2 and forgot what made her that character in the first place. Sarah had a purpose that she was willing to die for and they removed her purpose because it didn‚Äôt hit enough checkmarks for them. With John out of the picture, the film tries to re-create a link between Sarah and Dani, who takes over the role of Sarah‚Äôs son, by attempting to make a callback to the storyline of the original film. The filmmakers, however never watched the 1st movie or were offended by who the real Sarah Connor truly was.  In The Terminator, Sarah represented the nurturing mother. A woman who with the help of a strong male counterpart (Reese) built up the courage to become the strong, heroic character that everyone loved in the first two movies. A character who due to her maternal strength, resolve, and instinct was able to raise the child who would grow up to be the strong male character humanity needed to be its savior against extinction, John Connor. But since progressivism looks down at traditional family structures as oppressive to its agenda, all of that is stripped away. Instead of Dani learning the same lessons that Sarah did, she discovers that she is the hero the world needs and there is no need for her to lower herself for the sake of a man and humble herself for the sake of a child. You don‚Äôt need those things because progressivism says, you are already perfect as you are. Love and relationship which built the backbone of this franchise are torn away and thrown in the trash because how else is this film going to pass the Bechdel test?  Then that brings us to Grace. Grace is the character that has been selected to replace Arnold Schwarzenegger as the ass-kicking terminator we all know and love. Despite the fact that Mackenzie Davis is not as physically intimidating as Arnold was in the first film, making him an iconic character to being with. Despite the fact that she doesn‚Äôt have any of Arnold‚Äôs charm or memorable lines that made likable in Terminator 2. Despite the fact that she doesn‚Äôt have ANY of the marketability that Arnold has which brings fans back into theaters in hopes that maybe one of these films will be good. Dark Fate sets up Davis to be the new terminator moving forward as this film is supposed to be the jumping point of a new trilogy, why? Because the future is female and that female like all the others progressives envision is very masculine.  Once you realize that this film is nothing more but a feminist reboot of a franchise that should have never lived on past 1991, you see Terminator: Dark Fate for actually what it is, empty calories. Every impactful scene is an unoriginal retelling of an event that has already taken place in a prior movie that did it far better. The endgame of Dark Fate is to hand the movie over to progressive women so that they can be given something that they could never achieve on their own merits‚Ä¶a successful franchise.",2,3,Walter Duranty,oxy8udgWRmo,0.10855104071013164,2019-11-03 19:21:00,False,True

2019-11-04T12:30:52,"person to play a cyborg than Arnold? For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man. His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine. It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge. People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film. And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).  As we all know what the story is, I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it. First I have to mention Michael Biehn. He has the real starring role. He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience. He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why. It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right. But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him. Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies "" Terminator's don't feel pain. I do. Don't do that again. "" That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing. Biehn is perfect for the role.  This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films. And they are so passionate with what they have to say. I like it when a film has something to say. I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece. This is a masterpiece.  Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film. One, this is the first film where ""I'll be back"" was spoken. Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular. Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it. And he adds spark to any film that he's in. Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.",0,0,ERIC CARTMAN CARTMAN,oxy8udgWRmo,0.3105311355311354,2019-11-04 12:30:52,False,True

2019-11-05T00:02:09,"Okay. I love Terminator. I like this movie. It is the third best one... but I stead of getting constant reboots can be please stick to a plot and just continue. Rise of The Machines and Salvation I do count as reboots, but they were in the form of sequels and were a part of a cohesive timeline. The true problem started with Genisys where it's supposed to be a sequel to the first two movies, but it ultimately is a reboot that sets up sequels that never happened. Hell, you don't even need to have seen the previous movie because Genisys has distanced itself so much. It could of been a literal fifth movie and then once Kyle Reace gets sent back in time the movie continues would continue like normal, but at least it would of had the opportunity to wrap up the open ended plot of Salvation. But no Genisys did it's own thing in every way. Dark Fate is definitely better; it is the best one since T2. But the fact it's also a sequel to T2, like Genisys, has ultimately created three different timelines, but has now completely confused people. Hell, trying to explain how Dark Fate or even Genisys is now replacing Rise of the Machines to some people is difficult, because it's simpler to think the series goes 1,2, 3 & 4, not 1, 2 then 5 or 6. We now have three timelines, four if you don't want to accept anything after T2, but they all don't have an actual ending. In a perfect world, I'd like to think that we'd get movies that end all these timelines, but I know that isn't going to happen. So please, and now I'm finally getting to my point. Please, for the love of God. Stop doing reboots. If we are to see anymore Terminator movies, please pick to continue from either Salvation, Genisys, or Dark Fate and actually end this franchise. Stop making movies that set up other movies and plotlines that ultimately never get made or concluded. Please, pick a story and just go with it. I know a lot of people that want a future war movie so either make that a prequel to The Terminator or a sequel to Salvation and that could easily be the ending. Just please end this franchise some how if you insist on making more, but just stop with the reboots. Because I'm tired of this confusing timeline. Either do a prequel, a sequel to Salvation, I doubt you'd do a sequel to Genisys but it's an option, or do a sequel to Dark Fate.

They brought back Linda Hamilton, they brought back James Cameron, and it‚Äôs going to bottom out at $200 million globally.  How big of a fail is that‚Ä¶?  In 1984, when there was no global market to speak of, and without indexing for inflation, the original Terminator grossed almost $80 million globally, which is closer to $220 million when you figure in inflation. And don‚Äôt forget, Terminator was not considered a big hit in theaters. Most of us found it on VHS.  It gets worse‚Ä¶  Terminator: Rise of the Machines (2003), which everyone believes under-performed, grossed $433 million worldwide.  Terminator Salvation (2009), which is also seen as a disappointment, grossed $371 million worldwide.  Terminator Genisys (2015), which was seen as a flop, grossed $440 million worldwide.  Dark Fate‚Äôs gunna top out at around half of its ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù predecessors?  How is it even possible to do worse than clunkers like Salvation and Genisys when you reunite Arnold, Cameron, and  Hamilton?  What a fail.  But for all the flaws in the previous three sequels, those were at least not sold to the public as social justice lectures about how the future is female, about how we should open our borders to anyone who wants to come here, about how  the idea of fate is no longer about a mother protecting the future, but a GRRRRL-empowered Hispanic illegal alien Who *Is* The Protector of the Future ‚Äî because in 2019 America, the toxic theme of all-about-me narcissism is what Hollywood‚Äôs selling.  Did no one learn anything from the Lady Ghostbusters debacle?  Going back some 50 years, going back to Pam Grier, Sigourney Weaver in Aliens, Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2, Milla Jovovich in six ‚Äî count ‚Äôem, six! ‚Äî Resident Evil movies, America has accepted female action heroes without blinking an eye. But Hollywood was more sophisticated and mature back then. Instead of jamming it down our throats as a lecture, instead of attacking and marginalizing men with this ‚Äúfuture is female‚Äù crap, we were served great movies with believable characters and universal themes.  Hunger Games, Salt, Long Kiss Goodnight, Tomb Raider, Kill Bill, Charlie‚Äôs Angels, Wonder Woman, Mad Max: Fury Road, Silence of the Lambs, Lucy, Underworld‚Ä¶. A half-century of this stuff.  This is a country more than willing to accept female action heroes, if they are presented to us as fellow human beings, as opposed to these obnoxious, anti-male political statements that pretend American women live in some sort of repressed patriarchy. Things are going so week in America, so good, that Hollywood left is inventing problems and causes, and hoping to gaslight us into going along with the delusion.

I expected a lot of special effects. Alot of killing.   A franchise  that has been done over and o er again, but guess what? I went anyway. I sat through this movie and I friggin forgot the outside world for a bit.  I got lost for a bit in this fantasy movie. We saw an older Sarah Conner and even older Arnold and you know what? It was friggin amazing. We saw a slight twist to the usual plot, which I have to admit, took me by surprise. But it didn't matter!! The Twist actually works! The new savior, Mackenzie Davis? Dang she was fearsome! She had the moves and you can bet your last dollar that she was beyond hot. So having to see her for a couple of hours, was an added bonus, and next Lee made it just a tad bit more enjoyable, having to see someone like her, playing such a pivotal role and it didn't hurt that she so easy on the eyes!!

For example instead of some rogue AI suddenly taking control and wiping out most of humanity, why not apporach it from different angle where we would live in world where robots, machines and different kind of AI slowly are taking control of our society more and more and they then slowly start to take over humanity without most even realizing it.   I know it might not sound like terribly exciting movie, but add there some action elements and Sarah Connor trying to uncover and stop this ungoing dangerous development, discovering that there are actually already some very advanced human looking robots with advanced learning AI that have started to plot takeover...and that at first her biggest enemy would not be some Terminators, but the different huge corporations and nations who do not see the danger and try to get her arrested or killed by any means necessary  I mean something like that would have atleast for me been much more interesting first step to try to finally create a new series of Terminator movies. To have it bit more grounded on reality and where we are heading and try to change the narrative atleast a BIT from old Terminator movies, because now what we got was the exact same recycled storyelements, just with differently named AI and different would be hero from the future.  I mean we are at the kind of point in our own reality where AI development is getting more and more advanced and its along with automation is taking over countless jobs....this all was slightly touched at in Dark Fate, but not enough and it all should have been focused on that imho than again with the same recycled plot elements of Terminator coming to kill some one from future and the resistance sending someone to protect that person. Its the exact same reason why I didnt like Star Wars: TFA at all, because I was so fucking bored with the same old story elements being recycled.  I would like to remind everyone that somewhere in the VERY original timeline, Skynet was developed without the assistance from Skynet itself when it sent t-800 from the future to kill Sarah Connor in T1. Original Skynet was somewhere at the very beginning of it all developed differently than it was in T2 when Dyson/Cyberdyne got the scrapped Terminator from that factory.  So here they would have had that same chance of exploring things based on our OWN reality where more and more advanced AIs are being developed without any help by some time traveling robots...  So what do you think, would this have been the right apporach? Terminator movie more based on our very own reality and real life events for a change?

2019-11-08T14:27:18,"Quisieron imponerla como ""canon"", desprestigiando lo anterior (la 3, salvation y genesis) y terminaron¬†abofeteados¬†por LOS FANS, que mucha¬†ilusi√≥n¬†ten√≠amos¬†de esta nueva cinta. Finalmente, ESTA cinta pasara al olvido de los fans, una¬†pel√≠cula¬†que NO QUEREMOS, con introducciones¬†pol√≠ticamente¬†correctas y lo peor, la muerte de John. Si me preguntan, la ""Terminator 3"" para mi sigue siendo la mejor¬†continuaci√≥n¬†posible. Basta de ver a Arnold viejo con el pretexto de que es tejido vivo... rejuvenezcanlo con CGI! En la 3 al menos estaba en forma y se calzo en su¬†m√≠tico¬†traje de cueros negros (fiel a lo que fue T2), si esa¬†pel√≠cula¬†hubiera contado con Hamilton o Furlong, hoy sin dudas seria ESA la verdadera tercera parte. Volviendo a la nueva¬†pel√≠cula, creo que NO CAUTIVA.. Por que?... no es muy dif√≠cil al menos para mi y para cualquier fan√°tico de Terminator. En primer lugar cualquier pel√≠cula que se llame Terminator tiene que tener a Arnold Schwarzenegger robando el 80% de la cinta, ahora bien... en segundo lugar viene LINDA (que claramente es la PROTAGONISTA desde el minuto 1, ¬†ya que los acontecimientos de toda la saga giran en torno a ella) pero el personaje MAS PESADO Y GRAVITACIONAL en todo esto se√±ores es JHON CONNOR, osea... EDWARD FURLONG... sin mas, sin menos y sin injertos raros. En conclusi√≥n, que debi√≥ pasar para que esta peli ""llegue"" al publico canon y todo el mundo la entienda como una verdadera tercera parte? En primer lugar debi√≥ haberse llamado TERMINATOR 2: CHAPETER TWO (capitulo dos). De esta manera NO HABR√çA dudas en que parte cronol√≥gica se ubica ¬†este film ya que no todo el mundo tiene porque andar averiguando si esta es canon o las otras no lo son etc... los fan√°ticos lo sabemos porque estamos detr√°s de todos los pasos, pero no todo el mundo tienen la obligaci√≥n de entender y es L√ìGICO que MEZCLEN pel√≠culas y hasta critiquen sin saber, tambi√©n un poco el cine se trata de eso. Entonces, titulo mal dirigido, error 1. Error 2, la inclusi√≥n fallida de protagonistas nuevos, y no importa si son mujeres u hombres, el problema es que no solo son ""nuevos"", sino que de golpe son ""IMPORTANTES"" para la saga...(¬ø?). Tercer gran error e imperdonable teniendo en cuenta que es la ""verdadera"" tercera parte... NO INCLUIR a JOHN!!! y cuando digo John es a FURLONG! Que mejor motivaci√≥n para ver esta pel√≠cula que ver nuevamente una aventura EN CONJUNTO ¬†de arnold, linda y furlong como protagonistas? me¬†dir√°n, eso es la 2, pues bien! eso es justamente lo que siempre quisimos los fans!!! Ver mas¬†pel√≠culas¬†como la 2 principalmente!. Bastaba con solo 3 personajes, una buena historia (simple) y dejar correr la cinta, sin tanto CGi y sin tanto ""enriedo"". Porque digo enriedo? siento que este proyecto ya se manoseo mucho... y lo que se toquetea mucho o bien para que se entienda hay que explicarlo mucho... es porque evidentemente algo anda mal. ¬†Pero no nos confundamos, esta gente quiso ""refundar"" la franquicia para as√≠ poder completar una nueva serie de pel√≠culas con nuevo reparto (y asegurarse unos a√±os de ganar pasta), pero para eso se colgaron de la m√≠tica T2 con el pretexto que segu√≠a esa linea y bla bla.. FALSO! quisieron claramente empezar de cero y eso para mi es la peor falta de respeto. Yo me tomo el atrevimiento de compartir mi argumento.    ARGUMENTO:¬†    La pel√≠cula comienza en la fabrica (escena final de T2). Una vez bajado a la lava el T-800, cuando SARA y JOHN se iban de pronto lo ven resurgir nuevamente al t-800... COMO? De alg√∫n modo el T-1000 al fundirse cubri√≥ el exoesqueleto del T-800 (salvando su chip) y surgi√≥ un nuevo terminator que los combina a ambos pero con el aspecto de ARNOLD... este personaje es ""bueno"" ya que el cuerpo responder√≠a al chip del t-800 y el metal liquido del t-1000 solo hubiera servido para hacerlo mas poderoso generando as√≠ un terminator ""evolucionado"" (sin tejido vivo que envejezca, el aspecto se lo dar√≠a el metal liquido). Luego pasar√≠an los a√±os y el peligro ESTAR√çA EN EL PRESENTE. ¬†Porque si de seguir la T2 hablamos, imagino que a SARA le hubieran pedido disculpas por no creerle y la explosi√≥n de skynet a manos de DYSON hubiera generado a posterior alg√∫n debate mundial. Entonces todo lo mencionado anteriormente hizo que los humanos reflexionen y nunca mas piensen en vincular la tecnolog√≠a de manera masiva, ¬†para evitar que el d√≠a de ma√±ana una super computadora tome el mando del mundo. Pero eso no evito que se generen robots y alguien los fabrico, ese alguien fue el T-800 evolucionado(arnold) ayudado por un john adulto. El T-800 con todo el conocimiento del futuro que se alojaba en su cerebro (manuales de fabricaci√≥n, conocimiento cient√≠fico, etc), fabrico entonces los primeros prototipos, unos robots r√∫sticos de uso domestico. Esos robots r√∫sticos y de poca monta que el t-800 fabricaba como hobby, sirvieron de gran utilidad a la vida de Sara y John, pero sus conceptos fueron copiados por grandes empresas que pretend√≠an tomar el monopolio de la rebotica para sustituir al ser humano en tareas simples, hasta que un d√≠a alguien con la ayuda de fuerzas militares del gobierno, entro en casa de los connor y les robo los robots y los archivos de fabricaci√≥n. Ese material cayo en manos de un empresario poderoso y fue asi que finalmente este empresario multimillonario llamado Richard Reese, creo una empresa que comenz√≥ a fabricar en forma masiva estos droides con fines comerciales, fundando ""Reese Machine"", cuyo vice presidente era su joven hijo y heredero.. Kyle. Estos robots llegaron en masa a la gente a precios muy accesibles, todo el mundo tenia uno. Fueron usados de maneras muy rudimentaria, para cargar cosas, ayudar a chicos a estudiar, manejar maquinas, taxis, etc. Pero un d√≠a se revelaron y generaron un levantamiento mundial reclamando a este mundo como SUYO (al estilo planeta de los simios). Como ocurri√≥ esto? Reese, en su af√°n de controlar el monopolio de la robotica, cometi√≥ el error de ""entramar"" los chips de todos los robots, generando as√≠ una super memoria colectiva artificial que absorb√≠a datos del usuario humano (audios, fotos, preferencias, etc) y b√°sicamente, todos los robots estaban comunicados entre si por una nube, al mejor estilo WiFi.   Por otra parte, los connor junto al t-800, vi√©ndose incapaces de frenar esto, acuden a ""Reese machine"" para hablar con Richard. Cuando hablan se dan cuenta entonces que Richard tenia todo premeditado y el levantamiento de los robots hab√≠a sido planificado a la perfecci√≥n para eliminar al 50% de la poblaci√≥n mundial mientras la elite construida en paralelo una Ciudad modelo en el centro de los estados unidos en donde vivir√≠a gran parte de esa elite, con abundantes recursos.... la so√±ada SKY CITY. Es en ese instante en donde comienza la batalla de los connors y el t-800 contra Reese. Buscaran destruir ""la nube"" que manipula a los robots dentro de ""Reese Machine"" bajo las ordenes de un nuevo orden mundial. Es all√≠ donde aparece el rival, el prototipo mas moderno de la compania, el desarrollado por Kyle. Este prototipo es el antagonista de Arnold en la pel√≠cula, y tratara de evitar que los connor con la ayuda del t-800 destruyan la memoria madre de ""Reese Machine"". Cuanto mas tiempo pasa, mas gente muere. El robot villano, tiene ademas la orden de no exterminar al t-800, ya que pretenden capturarlo para experimentar con √©l y la tecnolog√≠a de metal liquido.    finalmente logran romper con la fuente de almacenamiento de ""reese machine"", todos los robots vuelven a sus tareas por defecto, ya es tarde, se ha exterminado al 40% de la¬†poblaci√≥n. Los connors quedan mal heridos y Sara finalmente muere. John y el exterminador quedan a la deriva, ayudando a los supervivientes, pero el t-800 al comprender tanta muerte, tanto desastre, construye una maquina de desplazamiento temporal, usando todos los¬†recursos¬†posibles ¬†y con un¬†√∫nico¬†objetivo, volver a 1991 y evitar que el T-800 sea bajado a la lava. El¬†exterminador¬†comprendi√≥¬†que √©l¬†hab√≠a¬†sido el culpable y¬†buscar√≠a¬†remediarlo bajo cualquier causa. Es¬†as√≠¬†que finalmente, despedido por John, el exterminador emprende el viaje al pasado para auto exterminarse, final¬†√©pico, escena emotiva, la despedida final de john con su fiel ""amigo"" exterminador.¬†Ah√≠¬†se cierra el circulo,¬†ah√≠¬†se cierra Terminator.        les dejo mi correo: studiosesma@hotmail.com",1,0,Diego Sesma,oxy8udgWRmo,0.009523809523809521,2019-11-08 14:27:18,False,True

2019-11-15T10:36:22,"What makes all these terminator movies un-realistic is because when someone wants to kill u, u can't really stop them unless u have divine intervention.  Think about it, in real life, they can't really even protect the president, if someone really wants to knock him/her off, as history has shown with a few already assassinated.  For example starting with the first terminator, any smart assassin will watch the target n look for an opportune time. They would just shoot the person with a long range rifle, snipe the person or even set a hidden bomb up.   It has a long time before the future happens, so it could of watched for all the Sarahs n get them one by one slowly all the time in the world, almost.   For the 2nd terminator, even easier, it can change to anyone.  So it can just follow and turn to anyone to get really close and then attack.   These movies may be interesting to watch, but nothing like the real thing, just ask KGB, CIA or even Mafia. These Terminators could even go hire criminals to kill their targets, put a under-world most wanted.  The terminators could change to anyone so, they can steal a bank and nobody will can find them.

2019-12-02T19:14:12,I'm shocked at how many people love this movie. I went to see it because of Linda Hamilton and she did not fail to impress me. Big fan of hers and always will be. The storyline should have stayed with John Connor. If they'd approached Edward furlong one to two years prior to making this movie he's young enough to have gotten him into the best shape of his life and let's face it enough money could encourage anybody. Cameron drop the ball on this one. The storyline was terrible and predictable.,1,0,kcorbie,oxy8udgWRmo,0.03749999999999999,2019-12-02 19:14:12,False,True

Arnold Terminator could use a hand held a M2 50 cal machine gun and shoot a 100 round into the new guy. We need to see the difference of 7.62 rounds and 50 cal on the new guy. 50 cals shoud cut off its arms and legs.  What I dont like is the black glue stuff of the new guy. T2 shiny liquid metal was original and great.  The black stuff was shown a lot in Spider man 3 already, not visually exciting.  And I dont like the acting and the look of the new guy, too humanized, not like T2 or T3 more robot like.  And Sarah Connor is way too naive, no professional terminator hunter character look.  As a terminator hunter she should have some sort of John Wick 3 black girl look with a couple of body armoured super dogs or something. And a big hiccup at the end, suddenly the mahcine look second body of the vilant dissapeared! One second it was fighting with Arnold and the next it was gone.

Instead they simply kill John & do a T1/T2 reboot. Hell I could've come up with that crap & been happy with a lot less pay to do it. It was embarrassing that they couldn't do any better.

Embarrassing that with this offering instead of making you forget the other ones, they helped validate them. I mean how difficult was it to change Kyle Reese to Grace, John Connor to Dani & Skynet to Legion. Wow. How inspiring. Fortunately I gave up on Hollywood some time ago & quit paying their exorbitant prices to go to theaters because it's usually either uninspired garbage, or chock full of someone's political agenda. So these days I just wait to see whatever they've got to offer when I can rent/buy as cheaply as possible. Honestly, they deserved to have this fail.

2020-02-01T07:04:41,"I just saw the movie, I think this movie failed!!  There are many reasons why it failed and I am going to tell you why:  1.  Arnold is old, ain't the same.  Sarah is old.  2.  When you start the movie out with the first 1 hr devoted to a bunch of female...and no Arnold?  It's a total failed!!  Terminator is about Arnold.  3. The villain doesn't look vicious deadly mean looking dude like in Terminator 2.  He just doesn't look deadly to me.  The guy in Terminator 2...when i see his face, i say ""shit.""  When i see the villain's face in Dark Fate, i was like, ""huh?""  He doesn't come off as a deadly villain to me...almost more like a nice guy?  So, this is bad to me.  4. Can't they try to be original instead of copying the success of the past?  You get a little scene here and there that you KNOW they try to imitate Terminator 2.  Like Sarah, saying ""i'll be back"" while she's searching for the villain on the freeway.  It's almost they're trying to be Terminator 2 in the general overall scenes, you got the gun scenes where Arnold stored all the guns, you go the copter scenes, you got the military prisoner scene that try to emulate the hospital scene in Terminator 2.  Hell, I think they even brought back the policeman that got killed while buying coke off a machine in Terminator 2.  5.  This movie need to be original and it needs NEW blood.  New blood meaning that it's time to retire Arnold and some of these old farts.  It's too bad that they take so long to make another one after T2.  They should have kept making sequels while Arnold is still young.  6.  Throughout the movie, the famous Terminator music theme never come on....the bad ass score that hit with the dada dada dada dada dada dada.  Well, looking back it's good thing they didn't use any T2 music because this movie isn't bad ass anyway.  7. Along with the villain, the female version of the other machine isn't appealing also.  Overall, i just don't like the casts.  I don't think they look appealing even Arnold and Sarah, they're old.  8.  The only thing i kind of like about this movie is the last fight scene.

2020-02-01T16:16:32,"This piece of sh*t is all about emasculating what vestige of masculinity has survived in today's millenial males. The opening scene proves it. As everyone knows when a terminator or its nemisis John Connor time shifts, both arrive naked then they get clothing from some unwitting male who happens to be nearby. That's because all the terminators were male, with the exception of that one female terminator who arrived clothed in some kind of fully armored leotard. In this latest farce, it's not John Connor who comes to save the day, but an augmented socalled white chick. she doesn't steal the clothing off of a nearby female who is clearly the same size as her. No, after beating up 5 armed Mexican cops, she steals the boots and the clothing of a female's boyfriend. Note...the symbolism, stealing the boots of a man in order to walk in them. All the victims in this movie and all the villains and the newest Terminator are males. Even the newest terminator is hispanic. So word of warning to parents or people in general who are fighting to put feminism, gynocentrism and misandry in a coffin where they belong, don't waste your time on this trash.  Like all the past Terminators, this one too indicates that in the future, no aboriginals aka socalled black people exist, with the exception of that one racist Terminator movie that blamed a socalled black father Skynet engineer for creating terminator. They end up sacrificing him by the way. In this installment the future is full of socalled whites and socalled whites of a the hispanic persuasion plust feminists and no socalled blacks in sight.

We also have a strong independent woman sent from the future to protect the already strong independent future leader and a terminator which can remove its liquid metal shell from a metal scheleton and basically duplicate (which, in essence, I found interesting, but somewhat unnecessary). Arnold doesn't even make an appearance untill the second half of the movie, and even then we find out he's been living as a boring father figure and husband to an abused woman and child. The theme: can a machine feel love? Next thing you'll have the Predator asking for consent to hunt! Enough is enough! We get it! The fight scenes are epic and in theme with the Terminator franchise. We have new and better killing machines, but I really don't understand the timeline. Apparently... this takes place after the events of the second movie, when John is stil a kid (good work on the CGI to make them all look young), but.... if John dies, the following 2 movies are illogical.

2020-04-02T05:48:59,"I'll ask with all honesty.  WARNING: SPOILERS      What was the point of killing off John and replacing Skynet with ""Legion""? Seriously, what is the point? Killing John was already a choice that made all the struggle in T1 and 2 essentially pointless. But completely replacing Skynet just rubs salt on the wound. So not only Kyle Reese and ""Uncle Bob"" died for essentially nothing, destroying or defeating Skynet itself had no point at all since it was just replaced by Legion. Looking at this from a critical point of view, this movie literally invalidates its predecessors T1 and T2, and its even worse when we're told it takes place right AFTER T2.   John's death is also extremely flawed in a sequel's stand-point. In T2, Uncle Bob, the T-800, explains what the T-1000 is, and even explains its a more advanced Terminator. Now, Skynet did manage to make the T-1000 mimic human mannerisms way more easily than the T-800. This is important because in the intro of Dark Fate, Sarah explains that another Terminator was a little late for the party. The issue is that this Terminator was Carl, a T-800. And again, its Arnold, so his face is recognizable by Sarah and John.  That suggests Skynet deadass sent the same face which tried to kill Sarah once back in time to infiltrate and assassinate John ALONG with the T-1000. Why not send TWO T-1000s when it is proven that is is an extremely effective killing machine that can easily disguise itself as someone neither Sarah or John have ever seen? The T-800 that aided them in T2 was melted to the very core, he's no longer an issue, so a T-1000 would be garuanteed to work, basically. Yet Skynet sent both, at the same time, a T-1000 and a T-800 who just happened to be late? Carl's existence, although I love seeing Arnold onscreen, makes no sense from a tactical standpoint.  And Legion is basically just a... darker and more beast-like Skynet? Ok I kinda like their designs but... why? What's the point of replacing Skynet? Oh yeah. To make the previous movies 100% pointless, because no matter what, apparently the future is going to Hell no matter what. And Legion did literally EVERYTHING Skynet was doing. So literally the only reason for it to exist is because they needed a new Skynet to make Terminator 2 again, but worse, since in T2 everything related to Skynet was essentially destroyed.   This is the main issue.

(Until T3 and the ensuing entries leading up to present day made us regret it) Tie up the loose ends of the plot to complete the circle, give the Terminator franchise some dignified closure, then move on to other ideas, we only need Terminator 1, Terminator 2 and Terminator 0.
