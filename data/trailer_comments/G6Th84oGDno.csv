But instead he decided to hurry up the stressed officer which in turn freaked the cop out who had probably seen some bad things that night which made him go into panic mode. And seeing as there are two people the officer doesn’t know and one starts acting up then another starts yelling from the car and could possibly have a weapon the officer did the right thing by trying to arrest the dude. But unfortunately the girl unnecessarily started yelling at the already nervous officer which in turn caused him to fear for his life. Then the girl refusing to comply was putting herself in danger by continuing to yell at the freaked out officer.

A group that has their own supremacist ideology and wants to dominate both of us. Does anyone have any idea who this group could be? I really have no idea, but I just get the feeling over and over and over again that there is a group that is perhaps could be maybe being pushed by Satan to  cause opposition and hatred. These people have rejected Christ's love and want to sow division and hatred to divide and conquer. The solution is to separate those who hate each other and let people live with whom they choose and not force people together against their will. That way everyone would be much happier. Both people will be happy and prosperous in the future they want to build not burdened by the other. Africa could be very wealthy and prosperous without White people and White countries could be very happy and prosperous without racial tension. It's a win win for both Blacks and Whites.

It’s called waffle stomping.    FADE IN:  EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY    MAX, a young man in his early 20s with glasses and a relatively small stature, is sitting just outside a coffee shop at a table with KIANNA, a college student with a face straight out of a fairy tale, lips that extend and curl beyond earthly capabilities, and eyebrows painted on by Vincent Van Gogh. The two are clearly on a date, but KIANNA is under the misguided impression that it’s just as friends, so she’s wearing a light blue tank top and jeans.     KIANNA  It’s called - wait - what? Waffle stom--    MAX  Waffle stomping. It’s where you poop in the shower and stomp it down the drain with your foot.     KIANNA  Oh, yeah?    MAX  I’ve been doing it for a year now and honestly it’s made me a better man.     KIANNA  That’s disgusting.     MAX takes a sip of his coffee, but he is visibly disgusted by the taste of it. He absolutely despises coffee.     MAX  That’s what I said when my boss told me about it!     KIANNA  You’re boss told you about this?    MAX  Of course.   (Suddenly pointing in excitement as if he sees something amazing)  Hey, look at that over there!    KIANNA turns away to look at what MAX was pointing at. She does so either out of courtesy because she is too nice for her own good, or because she is genuinely interested in what MAX has to say and show her. MAX honestly can’t tell.     KIANNA  (Looking over her shoulder, away from the table)  I don’t see anything.    MAX  (Dumping the coffee on the ground between the two of them)  It’s gone now. Give it up.    KIANNA  (Turning back to look at him)  Okay.    KIANNA notices the big spill. Coffee is dripping down the leg of the table, some even splashing KIANNA’s leg. She does a double take at the puddle of coffee and looks at MAX, curiously, expecting him to say something.     KIANNA  (After a long pause)  What’s that?    MAX  (Looking away from the spill, unnaturally, but intentionally)  What’s what?    KIANNA glances down at the big spill.    MAX  Aw, what’d ya, spill your coffee?    KIANNA  (Weirded out)  Uhhhh… No.    MAX   Hm. Weird.    MAX pretends to take a sip of coffee from his empty coffee cup, even though he knows damn well that it’s empty.                CUT TO:    INT. CAR - NIGHT    MAX is driving with KIANNA down the highway at night. Blue and red sirens flash in the background. They pull over to the side of the road. A white, mustached, middle-aged cop, OFFICER JENKINS, with a serious inferiority complex walks out. He’s wearing shades that are way too big for his face. He clearly wants to go on a power trip. He taps on the window and MAX casually rolls it down. “Shallow” is blasting from the speakers, and he calmly turns it down out of courtesy and respect for the law.     MAX  (Super confident)  IIII’m sorry officer. Was I speeding?    OFFICER JENKINS stares sternly at him without saying anything for a while, chewing his gum loudly.    JENKINS  That some kind of fucking joke? You fuckin’ joking with me?    MAX  (Immediately losing all confidence, becoming worried and nervous)  Whoa, whoa, I’m sorry officer. I’m sorry. Is there, a, um-- *gulps* -- is there a problem?    JENKINS  This ain’t a fuckin’ parking garage, son.     MAX  (Confused)  What?    JENKINS  Your ears broken or something? I said this ain’t a fucking parking garage. Why the fuck you parked here?    MAX  You… you… you pulled me over!    JENKINS  You nervous or something?    MAX  Huh?    JENKINS  Your hand there is shaking quite a bit. You trying to hide something? Drugs? Weapons? Women?    KIANNA  (Who had been sitting silently in the dark in the passenger seat until now)  Hi.    JENKINS  (Jumping in fear and scrambling to grab his flashlight and point it directly at KIANNA in the passenger seat)  Whoa! Who’s that!?    KIANNA   Whoa, whoa, I’m just -- we were just --     MAX  (Interrupting)  We were just on a date.     KIANNA  Huh? A date?    JENKINS  You trafficking this woman? You fucking trafficking her?    MAX  No, officer! I swear! She came with me willingly!     KIANNA  (More focused on arguing with MAX than with appeasing the cop)  Yeah -- as friends!     JENKINS  (Motioning to MAX)  Okay, that’s it, out of the car, crème brûlée!    MAX  But --     JENKINS   Don’t sass me! Don’t fucking sass me! Get out here, now! C’mon, let’s go! That’s right -- pussies on the pavement!    MAX  Pussies? What do you mean? I’m the only one out of the -- wait a second -- did you just quote Superbad?    JENKINS  No.     MAX  (Smiling knowingly)  Yes, you did. Yes, you did!     JENKINS  No, I didn’t!     MAX  Are you even a real cop?    JENKINS  Fuck yeah, I’m a real cop, cupcake!    MAX  No. I don’t -- I don’t buy it. You’re not real. There’s no way.     JENKINS  Oh, really? I don’t look like a real cop? This look like a real gun?    JENKINS whips out his gun and shoots right past MAX, dinging a stop sign.    MAX   (Freaking out)   What the damn!?!?    JENKINS  Yeah, that’s what I thought, ice cream sandwich. Now, since you’re Mr. Grammar Nazi, PUSS-AYE ON THE PAVEMENT!     MAX  (Looking at KIANNA)  You heard the man!    KIANNA  He’s talking to you!    OFFICER JENKINS  Looks like we got ourselves a misogynist folks!     KIANNA Actually, he's a very nice guy. You should have seen how he asked me out. I ignored him for a day and then he apologized and friend-zoned himself just so I would say yes.    OFFICER JENKINS is turned to face KIANNA. He starts cracking up hysterically. He can't help but lose balance and he roars with laughter at how pathetic MAX is. MAX is visibly bothered by this, and doesn't want to seem weak in front of KIANNA, so he forcefully shoves OFFICER JENKINS to the ground, mid-laugh, and grabs his gun before he falls.    OFFICER JENKINS What the goddamn-- Hey! What are you doing there, fucko!?   MAX shoots OFFICER JENKINS.

2019-11-16T08:12:27,This is why the economy is fucked. There is to many Titles like this being released to the public. They made this film after  incidents started with white cops killing coloreds while on duty. But I can't say I blame them since every time I watch Police Cam on TV it is a colored breaking the Law most of the time. It may sound racist what I am commenting. But This film is a joke and lately there has been a shit ton of films that has been released that is just as bad as this film.     This Title even puts a bad reputation on United States Law Enforcement being it is a white cop shooting a colored and then being shot by the colored. Since the 1800s coloreds has felt shame on them selves because they think whites are to blame for their actions most of the time when it is their own fault their reputation is what makes them look bad. It is why most of the colored Society does not get along with their own people because some of them actually do have common sense and deserve a good life.,0,3,Elizabeth Ocean,G6Th84oGDno,0.042105263157894764,2019-11-16 08:12:27,True,True

2020-03-23T21:38:15,"Not many movies leave you with an urge to reflect, seldomly do you come across a movie that provokes your inner essence as a human being. Leaving you with a plethora of emotions, how you wished they made it across the big puddle of water, how you wished that their love would thrive, how you wish the little boy didn't shoot that police officer. Not many films leave you with a nostalgic feeling of an old school romance set in the present. The dichotomy of a Just Crime.  Queen & Slim manages to gather a cocophony of emotions into 2 hours, laughter, suspense, romance, justice, pain, a smile and at the end a few tears. A couple of individuals who's Tinder date sparked a revolution, most importantly leaving them as symbols of their time within Black history. With an Element of Bonnie and Clyde and 2 stolen cars, this isn't a story of 2 greedy individuals wreaking havoc across the country. It's about 2 people who's lives are brought together by social media but are intertwined by the circumstances that follow. A love letter to Black people, Lena Waithe describes this and it feels this way as the story of these 2 strangers who are brought even closer by their crime perpetrated by an unjust system, makes the audience understand and fall in love with the characters as we watch them fall inlove in the midst of the storm they have created. Nostalgic in it's approach yet so relevant to the times it was created. Absolutely beautiful.  Queen & Slim",1,0,Kagiso Nkabini,G6Th84oGDno,0.08465909090909092,2020-03-23 21:38:15,False,False

2020-04-24T22:24:56,"Starring--Blood, Sugar, Sex, Dickheads  It just happened again. I read a news story about Flea playing the national anthem as a bass solo at Kobe’s final game with the Lakers and I went nuts. Every time I’m reminded that the Red Hot Chili Peppers exist, I lose my mind. It’s been a frequent occurence lately. They’re about to release a new record and the promo machine is gearing up.  25 years ago, when I worked at Epic, I had a fucked up experience with the Chili Peppers. The incident was about a 3 on the 1-10 scale of sexual harassment in the music business of the 80s and 90s, and I never consciously thought it was that big a deal. I wasn’t even aware of how intensely I hated them  until a couple of months ago, when the kid that works the desk at my gym played “Can’t Stop.”  I was furious;  I felt like my blood had been replaced with a million small bombs and all of them were about to explode.  I threw my weights to the floor mid-rep and pounded to the desk. Just before I screamed the only words I could come up with —  NO. MORE. CHILI. PEPPERS. — I realized I had to leave. I knew I’d be unable to restrain myself if I had to hear Anthony sing  “mop tops are happy when they feed you” or “can’t stop, addicted to the shindig, chop top, he says I’m gonna win big.” When  I calmed down, I thought about how overblown my reaction was, and allowed for the first time that maybe I didn’t hate them simply because they suck.  I heard stories about the Chili Peppers and the way they treated women long before Anthony was convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure in 1989 and Chad and Flea were arrested for lascivious behavior, battery and disorderly conduct in 1990. No one in the music industry really gave a shit.  As their legal issues made headlines, they  left  EMI, and every label, including Epic,  wanted to sign them. I was horrified.  I initially refused to even go to a meeting with the band. The  A&R guy was a friend, though, and after an hour of talking about it,  I reluctantly agreed to attend.  At the meeting, I did a credible impression of a person who didn’t think the Chili Peppers were complete shit;  I talked enthusiastically about strategy, artist development and press campaigns, and I presented ideas on further establishing their image.  None of them involved wearing socks on their dicks.  After the meeting,  I took two of the Chili Peppers to the storage room, where we kept the box sets and CDs,  to get the standard sign-with-us swag.  As we looked in a cabinet, they pressed up against me and told me about all of the ways we could make a super sexy sandwich.  At first I thought they were joking. When I realized they weren’t, I ran from the storage room to my office, where I closed my door, sat down at my desk, and cried. I was humiliated and weirdly ashamed, and embarrassed that I was humiliated and weirdly ashamed.   I thought I was a badass. Being a victim didn’t fit my self-perception.  When the Chili Peppers’ then-manager knocked on my door a few minutes later, I stopped crying and let him in. He offered an apology that sounded memorized; it was one he’d obviously offered many times before. The A&R guy apologized after the Chili Peppers left, and I decided to get over it.  I told myself that I knew what I was getting into when I started working in the music business. I was used to the shit that happened  late at night,  back in Boston, when I was wasted  and hanging out at gigs and after show parties. I wasn’t cool with any of it, but I accepted it, and even though the incident with the Chili Peppers  took  place when I was an executive at a major label, sober and doing my job at 2:00 in the afternoon, I decided to accept that, too. It was just the way things were.  Most of the women I know who worked in the music business in the late 80s and early 90s put up with sexual harassment. We didn’t talk about it to our friends, for the most part, and not many of us took any action.  We were ashamed or afraid or didn’t think we’d be believed. We thought we’d be blamed, or worse, we blamed ourselves. We didn’t want to be perceived as weak, and we thought that in order to succeed, we just had to put up with it. Sexual harassment came along with working in the music industry — it was an everyday reality — and a lot of us didn’t even realize that anything was wrong. Most of the reasons  we kept quiet will never stop being reasons —  shame and fear aren’t going to go away — but at least now we know when we’re being harassed.  I started writing about sexual harassment in the music industry in January, just after Amber Coffman tweeted about Heathcliff Berru.  I knew I had something to say, but I didn’t realize that it was about the incident with the Chili Peppers until I heard “Don’t Stop” at the gym.   I didn’t understand why my response was so extreme, and then, this weekend,  I talked to people I was close to at Epic.  One was my boss.  I never told him what happened,  and with the exception of two close friends,   I never told anyone else.   And that’s what disturbs me most.  Fuck the Red Hot Chili Peppers and  the misogynistic culture of the music industry that kept me from speaking up in 1991.  I wish I had.  I’m not naive enough to think it would have made much of a difference, but if it kept just one person from having to hear “Californication,” it would have been a start.",0,0,Mandy Cole,G6Th84oGDno,0.011191975939166954,2020-04-24 22:24:56,False,False
