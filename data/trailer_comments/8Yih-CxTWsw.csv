The Xbox One came out a year ago (when this movie comes out in 2015) and this shameless product-placement won't convince the youth to buy 'an old crappy console'. They want new cool stuff.    0:50 - Knowledge from the future?  Teens are somehow smart enough to build a time machine out of an Xbox 360 console and a few blueprints because they've done it before. Yeah. Convenient for the plot, yes. Logical? Nope.  0:55 - 'Shouldn't the next step be testing it on us?'  On who/what did they test the machine? Animals? Even if they did, the animal wouldn't be smart enough to alter the past, present or the future. There would be no visible evidence whatsoever to prove that the time machine works.  2:00 - 'I'm gonna go back and fix everything'  What about the ripple effects? Traveling back to yesterday seemed to have caused some fatal accidents and now you're actually considering going back years?! Wow, you're a murderer. You should be in jail.  2:20 - 'It could kill you David!'  Well, it didn't and it won't. David saw himself/future him on the birthday video. Obviously the machine is capable of time traveling years back. They should know better.  2:25 - Birthday Party  Congratulations! You're at your 7th birthday party. Now what?

Now if this is true, can we make a machine that can do this for us in seconds? It is a great thing to think about, please leave your responses on what you think on my hypothesis.

He would be going back to destroy the time machine not kill himself. However undoing the time in anywhere to change the future back would mean the tape, the filming would never had happened. a new time would exist and everything from that point on would be different or subject to change. However The paradox would not allow this to happen unless you take on that the guy is from a different time line. A totally separate person to the one that exists in this time line. Sort of Spock and Old Spock in the new Star Treks. ONe is from one time line and the other is from a different one. they exist because the events in which forced the spock back in time still happened in his reality. the only difference is this new realalty can alter its course. Okay for a another example. Last Star Gate SG1. They trapped themselves inside a time Dialation field. to surivive one of them had to remain old and keep the knowledge of the other life. Or they would just keep doing the same thing over and over again. So Te'lec is from an alternate realty from inside their reality. He resume the other persons life so there is no double. however he kept the alternate memories.  However this movie has none of that ability, His friends are vanishing, he is able to remember them, he is rewriting history, basically everything you can't do in time travel. he only reason to watch it is for the naked orgies in the 60's.

Him and his sister are stunned at the fact of this because, the guy has the ""original"" camera in his hand. They then compare both cameras for a bit, noticing that they're exact, then continue on starting the footage from the beginning on the ""new"" camera. The footage plays of his sister talking about the dad's old camera. They both have shocked looks on their faces and the face each other. The screen fades to black, but only for a couple seconds. It then shows another repeated scene from the ""original"" camera from the first time where he approached the girl to exchange their backpacks because they got switched. But, only this time, he already knows what's she's going to say and ends he sentence for her. He then leans in and says, ""I think we're about to change the world"".

Even though he told his father ""we don't get second chances"" he gave himself one by leaving both the camera he brought with him as well as the time machine his pops had stashed in the basement. What I can't figure out is how, when they turned on the one camera, did the camera keep recording? When the camera was turned on it recorded what was just said prior to the even turning it on.. Good movie. Also why, when he returned back from kissing her the first time, when he saw her naked for the first time he didn't smash. He just got back from the past his nut in the future still full.

They lost a championship and a plane crashed but that is not enough to make you stop time traveling just keep going back until you get a decent outcome like they did with the chemistry test. Also, in the grand scheme of things the problems they caused were not that great.

When David goes back to his 7th birthday party he takes Chris'/the camera they'd used to film the whole project. So when he destroys the time machine in the past it means he could never have travelled back so he disappears from the past and just goes back to the future, but he left the camera behind. So assuming his mum goes and finds the camera in the basement and puts it in the attic, that's the one they find at the end of the movie. Now think back to the beginning where Chris films David in the attic when she surprises him, that's why they see that footage on the camera at the end.

Start tripping with some friends, seeing crazy stuff, doing things you could never even think of before, then mentally detaching from your friends and the world around you, going into different worlds and stuff, getting paranoid, everything gets fucked up like you could never imagine before. Time loops, dealing with death and other crazy things that go far beyond your simple life, far beyond your understanding of reality...  On lsd, this can feel more real than reality. Lsd can be awesome but many people are not aware of the danger of bad trips. Things like that can get stuck in dark corners of your mind (hence the paranoia, flashbacks and trauma's). Also the nervous, energetic, fast paced feel of the whole movie reminds me of lsd, which can be nice. Now this movie can never go as deep into your mind, but try to feel the movie like it's real.

But if only the time will change it means the world keeps spinning forward or backwards in the same process. So when you're running out of like while time-traveling, you might get stuck in a wall or some feet under the surface of the place you came from. Didn't think about that before. Marty (from BTTF) always started in his Delorean, sped up when he finally got into 1955, he's just going on. But I guess if the physics (?) were right and regarded, the car might fall down or got wrecked from earth. Am I explaining it correctly?
