2019-06-28T22:18:16,"As much as I really wanted to enjoy this film, I just couldn´t. In my opinion, the only movie of this saga that is really good is the original. It premise felt really fresh and unique back in 2006, Stiller´s is a blast to watch as well as its amazing cast (Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Rami Malek, Steve Coogan) and the film had a lot of heart too since, though the Larry stuff with his job and son is generic, it really worked as the gist of the movie was a man destined to big stuff. Now, about the first sequel, I didn´t like it. It´s not a terrible movie but it lacked the heart and originality of the first one, and the situation surrounding Larry´s choice between staying an entrepeneur or going back to the museum was not interesting at all. Besides, as much as I love Amy Adams, her character was bland and irritating. Last, regarding the final sequel, it was absolutely terrible. Thank god I didn´t watch it in cinemas like I did with the previous two. This movie did not only show the writers and producers´s lack of new ideas, but it gave the impression that nobody was really interested in filming it. Every dialogue, every actor, each one of the situations felt utterly shallow and forced. I think they only did it to give the saga an end. Besides, it was released in 2014 (8 years after the original) and it really shows: the premise of the saga had just ""expired"" and the sequel was just unnecessary. PD: the chubby police woman character really got on my nerves.",0,0,Mateo Airaudo,KMKk7Dn__-Y,0.08219696969696971,2019-06-28 22:18:16,False,False
