2014-07-17T00:45:19,"Just saw a private screening (no I don't work for the studio). The film is excellent and Chadwick Boseman gives a legendary performance on par with Bette Middler in ""The Rose,"" Val Kilmer in ""The Doors,"" and Diana Ross in ""Lady Sings The Blues."" He IS James Brown. Yes, there are small insights into his spousal and drug abuse, but the film really focuses on his musicianship and his influence on the African American community. The opening monologue alone by an older James Brown is pretty damn funny, and yes, the film itself is VERY funny, and knows when it's time to get serious.  The musical numbers are flawless, locales within each decade spot-on, and every supporting turn, small part, and extra blend in nicely. Dan Aykroyd goes back to his acting roots in ""Driving Miss Daisy"" with a nice supporting turn as Brown's manager. Viola and Octavia, great as always, and other standouts include Lennis James and Nelsan Ellis.  The film pulls no punches compared to the trailer which is a glossy veneer. The trailer will definitely draw crowds, but the film itself is a much darker and funnier then what's playing right now.
