2017-08-01T20:48:54,"Finding out I was HIV positive wasn’t easy.  But, as time has passed, I have slowly come to terms with my HIV-positive status and try to tackle it with a positive attitude. In mid-2007 I became quite ill, I developed persistent flu like symptoms, headaches, a nagging cough and sores that wouldn’t heal, My skin felt as if it was crawling, my legs ached, I felt nauseous and lost weight.Then exhaustion hit, It was an indescribable tiredness and no matter how much I slept I never felt rested. In 2008 I was hospitalized when my CD 4 count nosedived to 86, HIV-negative people have a CD 4 count of between 700 and 1,000; a CD 4 count of below 200 is considered dangerously low). It was a terrible time. I have a vivid memory of sitting in a wheelchair covered with a blanket and catching a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I looked and felt like a little old lady was 32 I was so ill I could barely walk 200 meters. I hadn’t realized how little I appreciated my health until it was taken away from me,Fortunately I had a fantastic support system. Even though I was struggling to cope at work I didn’t lose my job. On the contrary the company I work for, my colleagues and my boss have been incredibly supportive throughout my illness. It was a frustrating time because I so desperately wanted to function like a normal human being, Yet I honestly thought I was going to die. I thought I was too far gone, It’s almost as if your body begins to reject everything it requires to sustain life, It was probably the scariest time of my life I wished not for a bigger house or more money or a fancy car I wanted to have the strength to go for a simple walk on the beach, clubing,singing and even dancing But i never had these chance to do all i wanted not until when i came across an email on a website which was spectator sites based on advice site, i saw these email of a man whose name was Dr magician i read an article on how he help cure someone HIV sickness at first after i read it i laugh for the first time because it was as if its a joke or scam, But there was a thought in my mind saying try your luck i could resist these But to email the Dr whose email was 4Godmustbless@gmail.com i emailed him with my heart full of faith and believe and guess what?? he replied my mail and agreed to help me But he said it wasn't easy at all which i knew already so i have to comply with 4Godmustbless@gmail.com and i provided all he said because money was nothing to me when i was half dead so gave the amount to him that he demanded to purchase magical materials and herbs And within a week he emailed me back telling me he is done and he asked for my home details and he got a parcel sent to me with DHL company and here i am now feeling so much healthy and free from Hiv i just got back from the hospital days ago and i was confirmed negative i know these is hard to believe But my dear brethren in the lord there is nothing that God can not do here is your chance to try your luck if in any infection i believe Dr magician to be a very powerful and strong herbalist email His address 4Godmustbless@gmail.com remain Blessed. yours faithfully Anastasia merry",0,1,God must bless,YVwQNDS-Zes,0.0908047138047138,2017-08-01 20:48:54,False,False
