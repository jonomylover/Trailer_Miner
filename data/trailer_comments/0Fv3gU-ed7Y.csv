It's used to narrate the story. It's not a record of events.  Anyways...you know why they keep giving M. Night Shyamalan (yeah, learn to spell it morons, it's not that hard) money to make movies? Because, when you get right down to it, he has made some pretty amazing movies that people could only dream of having credit for. Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, Lady in the Water.  The Happening would have been loved if it said directed by some other director, people just got on the hate bandwagon and didn't give it a chance (I admit Wahlberg sucks playing a guy with pathos; Liam Neeson or Jeremy irons would have given the movie more gravitas than a meathead like Wahlberg).  Airbender is just as much as disaster as any Michael Bay film - heck it's better than most Michael bays films.  And After Earth is Will Smith's baby so, I don't really consider that a Shyamalan film - unless you think Speilberg didn't influence Poltregeist at all. And if you didn't get that reference - you may not know movies enough to talk about what's really good and bad.  I think this movie will do fine. I'm no hater.

The term derives from the said patient's confusion during the evening or while the sun is setting. Apparently this is when bizarre behavior may occur. So the ""bedtime before 9:30"" tag line should certainly pertain to the grandparent's disorder as the main concept for the ""horror"". I personally never have heard of this disorder before, I had just read about it, but I conclude that Night will dramatize a real illness for the sake of 94 minute entertainment.

2015-10-19T16:41:20,"MY RATING 5 out of 10. M. Night Shyamalan has had many critics over the years and quite rightly so because since making The Sixth Sense he has made some shockingly bad films.  The Visit is not up there with the worst films he has made but as with a Shyamalan film it has many faults. This is the story of a brother and sister who are sent to their grandparents in the country , who they have never met before while their mum goes on vacation and they turn out to be just a little bit odd. The biggest problem i have with this is surprisingly not the story but it's the kids , or one in particular . The boy. I can't remember seeing a screen kid more annoying and i was willing bad things to happen to him. There are some spooky moments but not nearly enough and the director's attempt to add humour to the film , failed miserably .  Evil Dead it ain't.",1,0,redvalleyjohn,0Fv3gU-ed7Y,-0.2001050420168067,2015-10-19 16:41:20,False,True
