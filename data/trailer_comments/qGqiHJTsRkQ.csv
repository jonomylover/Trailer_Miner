This one is even MORE worth noting since the reason he took on this role, playing a character who is a complete departure from Cap, is exactly that-   He wants to do other things, and the comments about him cursing demonstrate how far that has gone so far. He's great as Cap, no question there- but I wish him luck in other roles and if anything is VERY clear from even just this trailer- he's having a blast playing against typecast, same as Craig is clearly enjoying over-embellishing that ridiculously southern sounding accent(though if you want to see more of this from Craig, check out Lucky Logan).   As for people being reminded of Murder on the Orient Express- Agatha Christie wrote that one, and many other murder mystery novels, such as ""And Then There Were None"", ""The A.B.C. Murders"", and so on(she also created Hercule Poirot who, if you don't know him, is a detective as famous as Sherlock Holmes.) - and this movie is VERY much inspired by her work, and the work of other mystery novel authors from the past...hell the title font/style being used for this trailer and the posters, is exactly like the font and text style that would be used on those very novels.

In the article, Ochab stated that the claims that China's communist regime is killing prisoners of conscience, and in particular Falun Gong practitioners, to supply its organ harvesting industry, are supported by substantial evidence.      Forbes said that the Chinese communist regime harvests organs from Falun Gong practitioners.    She stated that organ transplantation is a highly regulated medical procedure, and the World Health Organization has produced a publication called the Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation to clarify international standards for organ transplantations.    ‚ÄúFor example, Principle 1 requires consent from the donor to organ removal for the purpose of transplantation. Principle 10 requires traceability of organ transplants and Principle 11 - that donation activities be transparent and open to scrutiny. By contrast, organ harvesting is the illegal practice of removing organs from individuals (whether dead or alive) without their consent,‚Äù Ochab wrote.",0,0,ÊùéÂñÑÂæ∑,qGqiHJTsRkQ,0.020606060606060603,2019-07-04 20:47:26,True,True

I saw it on Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, got it on 4K on Tuesday,  and wow, it just gets better every time i see it! The A-List cast works very well together, the story gets interesting by getting more complex without adding too much info we never saw, the humor is great, but doesn't downplay the emotional core of the movie, and there are so many new details to find upon repeated viewings. It's now one of my Top 6 favorite movies.   For anyone screaming ""Rian Johnson is a terrible filmmaker!"" just because of Last Jedi, I encourage you to watch this movie. His style is great, but it just didn't fit with Star Wars.
