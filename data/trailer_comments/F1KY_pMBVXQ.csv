2014-03-22T17:14:07,"Deliver us from Evil......... sigh. ............................................. In the history of religion is humans desire, want, greed for the tree of knowledge, removed man from the Garden of Eden by our God.  Desire, want, greed is the beginning of human’s sin and continues in each and all humans today. God who came from above is the creator of human.    In the year of 1871 a secret meeting made in the District of Columbia with the US Government and the World Bank. In this meeting, a new US law created. It is the ACT of 1871 modifying the US Constitution creating the United States Corporation, each State a Corporation, with each locality below it a Corporation down to each individual citizen in the US legally a Corporation too. After this new law, each person born birth certificate were also considered a BOND and this bond is stored at a Bank and traded around the world, with you and your labor being of value for the World Bank.   Note the ACT of1871 came into effect because the US was in debt and the World Bank offered to loan them money to get out of this debt; thereby making each individual a slave to the World Bank. This law was created in secret and illegally, but since is solved many problems of the economy at the time, illegal change to the constitution was ignored by the Politian’s.   Prior to the great depression, the US had the roaring 20s with the stock market was going up and all were getting richer. This happen, because it was influence by the World Bank to make it legal to invest in the stock market on credit, which eventually led to the stock bubble\market crash. This event set the stage for the World Bank to offer and help save the economy of the US and its unemployed people.    After the stock market crash the World Bank, said if they could manage the money and the US leave the gold standard, the economy then be manipulated during up and down times the quantity of printing the money supply and changing interest rates to the banks. Therefore, the US left the gold standard, which supported money backed by gold, and the Federal Reserve Bank\a private company created to print the money supply for the US. Since the money no longer supported by gold, money should be referring to it as currency. For the Federal Reserve to help the US, it was to receive payment of a 6% tax to the American people. So shortly, after the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank, was the creation of the Federal Income Tax This means you Federal Reserve Tax you and I pay goes to the Federal Reserve Bank, which owned by the World Bank, which is centered in the United Kingdom. The people of the US do not receive the Federal Income Tax.   From the beginning of 1871 to 1933 the Government Politicians we elected were suppose to be responsible enough to manage our debts, our money, later our currency for the benefits FOR THE PEOPLE.  Since all humans politicians are influence by desire want and greed they could not for the majority of time tell the US population as a whole NO and lose their own popularity as well enrich their own power and through side deals their own pockets with currency.   One-way for our founders of the US Constitution to fight the inherit nature of humans of desire want and greed was via transparency to the US people citizens with the use of Freedom of the Press.     After many wars in the World after 1871\1933 different countries over time saw the US being the most powerful country in the world, offered to keep and protect other countries gold for them. With the World Bank being the owners of the Federal Reserve and the owner of the major banks in the US and major often much manipulate lies go on with the stock markets, use of gold and economies. Many countries in the world became suspicious of this and wanted their gold back from the US and as France and a few other countries requested their gold, became apparent to the US government we no longer possessed all he gold and if we met these request, would be left with nothing. In 1971 President Nixon, to the US completely off the gold silver standard and no the rest of the world no they could not have their gold. After this time, the US currency became 100% back by nothing and the printing of currency yearly is in accelerated growth inflation.   In recent years, it became legal for gold to be lease out in to the market and still listed as a one line item on the accounting books, giving a false impression the gold is present, when it is not. This called gold silver fractional lending. The result of this has several effects.  The first for the US government it can make it seem publically we have more physical gold, than we actually do.  What happens is the US government, Federal Reserve Bank, other large Banks in the US, will all lease out the same gold and buy and sell these leases making a profit for themselves and keep the market value of gold suppressed by the illusion there is more gold on hand, than there actually is.  Again, a few countries in the world became suspicious of wrongdoing and requested their gold back. Germany most recently requested their gold back and the US told Germany that it would take 7 years. Meaning while as a peace offering to help try to pacify German a small token quantity of gold sent to them. When Germany research the serial numbers on the gold, they said it was not theirs, which is another proof the US has no gold on hand and scramble to send gold to Germany from any other source.  In recent years as China can clearly see the written on the wall of the lowering price of Gold, they are buying up quick cheaply, paying for it with US dollars, which are having little diminishing value every day.  China is now the single largest buyer of gold in the world, passing India.   The World Bank, Federal Reserve Bank and other large banks own much of the public media and put forth in a slow calculate image to the public as well disinformation too. The world is in the middle of an information age with most of society overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of new information said every day. This overwhelming of information, combined with disinformation by the World Bank then is a useful tool as well as its owned media. A thorn to the general public media is the internet. An observance of the internet as I search is the ‘quality’ of WebPages, Blogs and you tube videos has increase dramatically. While I research a particularly subject and find myself in the middle of a internet media well made then goes off an extreme tangent of fiction of absurdity, leaving me again wondering to myself of the big picture what is true or not.  Then as I again look at the absurd fiction media, extremely well made, supposedly by people like you and me, novices, I ask myself the question why would a person make for ‘no dollar gain and much use of their time’ create such an odd wrong fictional media? Like information, I find on the internet, I cannot hold the fact in my hands the source of information. Like with any good science fiction movies I have seen in the theaters, anything can manufacture or faked and appear real. I consider the internet as ‘hearsay’ a helpful source of information, but not fact itself. If you want to know a fact, you must get a close as possible to the source as possible and get as many other people to verify that fact from their own individual perspective too.   Oddities of history, archeology record and sciences sees but will not talk about in the public view, yet they individually know exist. I believe the reason it not allowed in the public view is again another continue effort by the few who run the World Bank. As we research the history, archeology and science of the Sumerian, Babylonian, Egyptians, India, Ancient China, various cultures of South America a science known by these ancient cultures and a creation of their monolithic structures not be duplicated today and is still unknown how they accomplish these things or where their knowledge arrived from.   The first rule for the public media is all-ancient religion, culture; structures arrived are from imagination and fantasy, despite if science might prove some of those details to be fact. Remember the World Bank owns the general public media.  You as an individual have to come to terms, your own common sense does apply and what you feel to be true, despite the highly paid authority telling us it is not, could very well be true. By the general working folk, good ideas spread about and repeated, then enhance. They do not go away. Over all in the public, the worker in life learns on the job from the sciences, architects and engineers of what they are creating and in the process of creating other people creations, takes what they learn home with them, then repeats what they have learned.  Except if, you are a lesser species animal on the Earth. If we humans teach an animal a skill, we only teach them what is required as we exploit that animal, as a horse or cow maybe taught to pull a wagon or plow. Humans consider all other animals on Earth available for exploitations. Note we humans do put blinders on a horse to keep him focus on the task, the same way the general media feeds us falsehoods driven from the World Bank.   The Sumerians are considering the beginning of human culture civilization for humanity. Scribe in their history was the creation of language, math, science, planets and stars, the calendar, farming, plumbing, tools, weapons, government, laws and the knowledge they created for the benefit of the Gods who came from heavens above.  Sumerian history tells that humans created for the purpose to serve the Gods. This same story of creation is clearly written in Sumerian, Babylonian, and Hebrew, Jewish and Christian history or religions. The general media promotes with the public science that religion is an ancient fantasy of human history and not scientific fact, despite all the scientific knowledge known by these same ancient cultures.   Neanderthal man has a skull larger and a brain larger than modern homo sapien man. From 25,000 years ago of the interbreeding of modern homo sapien with Neanderthal to as long as 600,000 years ago, Neanderthal existed on Earth.  Neanderthal man lives within in the environment and had a toolbox  largely did not change.  Since Neanderthal live within the environment like any other animal on the planet, there is little reason to expand the toolbox. He was at home on the Earth.  Neanderthal man lived in small groups, tribes and with these tribes function independently.  Most of the time the tribes stakes out a area of land and keep to themselves, but occasionally they steal a female or traded a female from another tribe and this help keep the gene pool mostly stable. Is also proven scientifically that Neanderthal man have a vocal language.  The whale, dolphin and a few other species on Earth have larger brains than modern humans have and like Neanderthal man, cannot write down a language, so having a larger brain is very useful in remembering what you have learned.   Going back to Sumerian history, as the Gods created humans several different variations created.  It  written the Gods were not satisfied with all the variations.  The gods also created for the Sumerians the written language. It is the written language the separates us from all other animals on Earth and Neanderthals.  Prior to written language the best we could do was pass on knowledge with stories and the majority of Neanderthal knowledge was gone as each person died.  Written knowledge, could the pass onto the future generations, despite death and having a smaller brain.   There exist all around the Earth variations of the human skull from archeology that both surprises science and exist without explanation. This skull comes in two variations, but both are larger than the human Homo sapiens. These human type skulls are larger that humans in being longer or just rounder and while Homo sapiens skull is divided by three areas, these skulls are divided by two.  These skulls are found in Egypt, North and South America and other places on Earth. Recently hundreds of these skulls were found in Peru and DNA sampling was performed on them. The DNA said they are not homo sapien but some odd variation of primate and it is unknown scientifically archeology where they come from.   Towards the end of the Roman Empire, much of the Romans were sacrificing Christians as entertainment. As Roman power was diminishing and the belief in Christian beliefs was growing despite and possible from the sacrificing of Christians, Roman power decided to take advantage of the Christian beliefs religion and form the Roman Catholic Church of which Christian belief, forgiveness handed given the priest via the Roman authority. In one select Egyptian period of one leader stood out different from the rest. He did not believe in many gods but only believed in one god. He last cast out of Egypt banished and all is writings scratched out removed from Egypt history and temples.  His name was Akhenaton.  There are many historians and archeologists that believe Moses and Akhenaton are the same person.  He had a strange large long head with a strange body as well as his wife and children. And as many are aware from the creation stories, those in the beginning of humans lives thousands of years.  Often in reflection, we modern humans wonder why we no longer live thousands of years as it written in the past.  Now consider that a different type of human that lives those thousands of years in the past and their children now grow to live thousands of years currently.     Modern Science will easily say “Oh yea, there is intelligent life out in the Cosmos, easily”. But ask them if cosmic aliens visited Earths past and suddenly they draw silence.  Again, as science observes the cosmos, planets and say Mars as we notice from distance strange lines, objects on Mars, we all get excited we found something unnatural, a sign of alien cosmic intelligent life.   We gives me reason to believe that the ancient great Pyamids built on such a perfect scale and monolithic size is a sign to an cosmic observer the area of Orion, “Hello, hi, here we are a reflection of you in the cosmos”,  and the scale and knowledge of how this sight was created is still a scientific unknown.   If the Gods of the past who came to Earth made variations of humans, some may exist that have larger heads than our homo sapien self, consider themselves a higher form on life and all animals that exist on Earth are to be exploited as the common humans are taught. This strange human would have no problem exploiting homo sapiens, lead the Roman Catholic Church, and hide their own strange heads with the strange hats the churches wear and perhaps have the ability to live thousands of years old.    Finally, the final fact of the matter is the head of the World Bank, the CEO is also the elected Pope of the Roman Catholic Church.  I am not implying Hebrew, Jewish, Catholic Church is wrong or bad; I believe absolutely in Christianity. From the creation story too, Lucifer, the devil was once in heaven, later to removed of power from the heavens and forced on Earth.   This leaves to me the possibility of several variations of humans on Earth. One is human homo sapien the Hebrew, Jewish Christian,  guilty of the original sin of desire, want and greed tempted by the devil, the liar, which wants to make slaves of us all, via our currency, making bonds of humans our corporation self.   We humans already know what to do and have done it in the past and it exists in our US history too. On a daily basis we need face our sins, open about them, transparent with the use of Freedom of Speech, democracy.   But soon the world currency will collapse, because this is what the World Bank Powers want to bring about a world currency a world power led by only a few.  When the currency collapse, much chaos will occur in society, much war, people will lose homes and property, jobs and food. In our hour of desperation the NEW WORLD ORDER will offer a solution, they will want to put a micro chip number in all of us to track and control us, saying this will bring each of safety.  At this time, we will be so desperate for safety, security, food and shelter we will say yes at a complete loss of our freedom.   Remember..... remember..... when our founders created the first US Constitution for the for 100 to 130 years or more as we were a FREE people, the country only had 3% inflation and the individual kept the benefits of their work with the purpose of government was to ensure individually the rights and freedoms for the individual. They were wise to know in advance the temptations of man and so made it clear for all of us a transparency of government and society the Freedom of Speech as well.  I cannot save one person on this Earth religiously, nor can another save me.  I as an individual will be judge by my God. Therefore, it is up to me to find and follow my GOD and so implies the importance of Freedom of Religion in our government too.   I for myself am Christian. Our God exist with the Trinity. God is good and bring order to all on Earth as in Heaven. Jesus who loves and forgives humanity for Jesus God walked in our shoes on Earth as man. The Holy Spirit that lives sees and knows the truth of our actions and spirit of our intentions.   The above comments are a work in progress. ~ me                    ",0,0,Jeff Lee,F1KY_pMBVXQ,0.06676107580362897,2014-03-22 17:14:07,True,True
