Instead the story focuses on two/three suspects, so that it is clear early on that it has to be one of those. Most of the characters don't get enough screen time. This makes it less thrilling.  Also the detective is not unique at all. In fact he seems to be a bit of dumb. I wanted him to be more memorable.

I just watched this movie recently, last night, to be exact and boy was I surprised at how well they thought about everything in this movie. Plot? The best. Tension build-up? The best. Cast? The best. Everything was really great. To be honest, before I watched this movie, I was like ""meh, prolly just some cliche murder mystery movie"" but heck naw, it was really great. Agatha Christie will probably murder me in my sleep because of this but I think I love Benoit Blanc as much as THE Michael Poirot. Anyways, go check it out you guys!!!
