This movie is based on the Japanese sci-fi novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" and the original character in it was a young Japanese soldier. Instead of giving the lead role to an Asian American actor Hollywood continues its racist practice of marginalizing nonwhite actors to just stereotypes and supporting actors in favor of white actors.  Warner Brothers previously did this with Argo where the real life person that Ben Affleck was playing was Latino, they want to do it with Akira by whitewashing the Japanese characters and now they have done it with this movie here.  The ironic thing is that in the original novel there was a female character who was a white American meaning you could've still have a white person in a lead role if you followed the characters' ethnicities as in the original novel but the fact that Warner Brothers and Doug Liman whitewashed the main character from a young Japanese character to Tom Cruise shows that Hollywood is a white supremacist institution.﻿",0,2,DaRunningMan,yUmSVcttXnI,0.08977272727272728,2014-03-25 23:43:48,True,True

But, it would be like an fps rogue-like with a story to explain the rouge-like elements. And the more the player finds out through each play through, the more they're able to branch out and explore the game's world. So the player won't know what's going on in 1 play through, then in the next they'll find out a different objective, and then in the next they'll find out another and another, etc., etc.. and that would just be awesome imo. Of course the replay-ability would stop as soon as the player finds out how to reach and kill the big bad boss, but still. It'd be neat to see playing through a game over and over again as a game mechanic... like rogue legacy or (I suppose) dark souls mixed with fps action. The more you know, the easier it is.
