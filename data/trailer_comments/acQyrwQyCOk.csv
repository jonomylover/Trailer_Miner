See that scene in Insidious Chapter 2, Astral Projection. In the scene Elise was a young lady that time, entering a mansion for an activity. That was the beginning. When, Insidious Chapter 3 came in, Elise decided to stop reading some paranormal or whatsoever according to her beloved husband who died. However, Elise realized that the girl in the Insidious 3 with a wheelchair needed help because of this entity with a breathing mask stalked her. Elise save the lady, and did you remember those 2 guys who were paranormal experts? That was the time they new Elise as a perfect and gifted clairvoyant. So, that was the story why did the 3 of them had partner of all paranormal activity. Then, Insidious 1 and 2 came in as the continuation of Dalton, this time he was now a father with a 2 kids, one of his kid knew how to do an astral projection. If you could still remember the Lady in black name Parker, that was the entity who stalk Dalton way back when he was young. That is why they have connection with Elise. Insidious 1 and 2 is a back to back story and the chapter 2 is the last part or to be continued because Elise was dead at the end of Insidious 2. The Insidious 4 Chapter The last key is the continuation of Insidious 3, Do you still remember the last part of insidious 3? Elise said, ""Hey guys, what is the name of your team? A paranormal expert? haha, Do you want to see a ghost? They decided to be partnered in all paranormal activity, that is why the Insidious 4 comes in. The Chapter 4 story line is Elise had a chance to stop the curse with the best of her ability. Insidious 4 is the continuation of Chapter 3. Remember, the Chapter 2 is the recent story, where Elise is dead and where Alisson is out of her self so it is cliffhanging.

This is going back to where it all began for her. A shaman becomes one, because they've had to experience something really bad themselves. And theirs is usually one of the most horrifying ones. I still can't believe how far they planned on going with this, cause it's some real shit, not some made up bullshit horror movie.

2018-06-27T12:52:31,"I experience sleep paralysis on occasion one time I saw a very tall man in a neat suit, his shirt was completely white, clean, and illuminated slightly. He had no face where his face features should appear, and his head was bold. In the paralysis state I was sitting half up on the couch in my cousins living room (I was sleeping over at my cousins army reserve house at the time with my mum on a couch on the other side of the room, in Turkey just visiting.) my arms would not move neither could my head because I tried to look around as he crept into the room. For the first few moments/second I mean I couldn't measure the time really, I felt no fear, there was no emotion besides curiosity. But once it entered into the room fully and loomed closer it looked right at me through where his eye sockets should be but there was not even a dark hollowed out hole, just a clean skin surface. As it bored into my eyes I felt forced fear climbing up within me to my throat then out of my came the silenced screams stifled by his power. I screamed with all my power in Turkish for my mother to wake up, but she couldn't hear me I wasn't in her world. I was still sleeping and in my consciousness this thing attacked stealing my energy force and my ability to fear again. I am pretty sure it took most of my fear, fed on it.  Once the faceless b*sta*d got what he wanted I awoke from the attack frantically looking around my cousins lounge room. He was not there, and my mum was sleeping soundly.   On another sleep paralysis occasion experienced recently I saw a troll staring right at me through a red and black lined mask it smiled widely baring it's shark like teeth through the mask. I saw him because I was tossing and turning trying to fall a sleep almost achieving then waking up again in a tired state, I had turned once more and there it was standing face to face with me just staring. I saw it for half a second, because I closed my eyes very fast and turned back around super fast. I pretended I did not notice or see it, I was afraid for another minute I tried to not look in the same direction for a while. I turned around to try my luck and I was lucky because it was gone.",0,2,Sinem Pacaci,acQyrwQyCOk,0.09001526251526253,2018-06-27 12:52:31,False,False

I am not going to touch on everything like I should do because, in my opinion, you watch this and tell me is it important to say everything. But instead of ranting about this movie I will give my final verdict and it is a 3/10 because what was the point of going all the way back to the beginning to start prequel, it should have been a sequel to the third one, it seems like they keep doing these to the series of horror movie like ""The Conjuring"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" you get my drift, stop doing this to movies, if you want the fan to understand the lore of a movie series then bring it to the beginning of the series not half way in it.",0,0,Lovish Landson.U.M,acQyrwQyCOk,-0.014444444444444442,2019-02-02 03:23:16,False,False

2019-05-27T16:34:02,"I give this movie a solid 5/10. I was definitely more into the compelling lore of the ever intercepting stories that ties to one another. I do appreciate the emotional weight for our ghost fighting veteran, and it makes me admire her more.   However, it didn't feel like a horror film, it felt like a dark drama. Nothing stuck out as horrifying. What most people in the horror industry don't realize is that jumpscares only hurt their work. You WANT your audience to leave paranoid, sometimes perplexed and disturbed that will follow them out.  Instead, we just get startled. We only anticipated on getting startled, not terrified. (Jumpscares are cheap)   What I also frown upon is the trailer vs. the movie. We see something in the trailer, we get something else instead during the film.  Some of the trailer scenes aren't even in the movie. If you're going to show us something in the trailer, promise your viewers to deliver. That's the purpose of a trailer, it's a peek into what you're going to see. Otherwise, I believe that's called false advertisement. (Lying)   I'll stick around to catch the last chapter. Sadly, the only reason why I care to stick around now is because of the cliffhanger from the 2nd movie. Nothing more.",0,0,Jennyun,acQyrwQyCOk,0.06052631578947369,2019-05-27 16:34:02,False,False

Until one of our friends said that instead of scaring her, why not scare her using the real movie by watching IT (2017) and after watching IT, another friend asked us to watch Insidious (2010) and it brought me into a trauma. My favorite horror villain characters are Pennywise and Kayako because I was never scared of them and I can impersonate them but the demon in Insidious and Valak are my horror villain traumas. Everytime I go to the shower, every single time I close my eyes, I see their faces. The demon's face haunts me esp the scene in in the first Insidious where he was on the ceiling and the song that was playing is creeping me out. And I vowed not to watch the following Insidious. A few months after, after watching The Conjuring 2, and being traumatized by Valak's face, I decided to face my fears and watch the next Insidious movies WITH A FRIEND. (I would never watch Insidious, Annabelle or The Conjuring alone) and then earlier, we just finished watching Insidious 3 and tomorrow we're going to watch The Last Key.
