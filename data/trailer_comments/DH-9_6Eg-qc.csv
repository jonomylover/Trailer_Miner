The original black christmas story took place over a course of a few days centering around a missing person while a sorority is being harassed by a criminally insane convict. This looks like it is taking that concept and re-imagining it altogether raher than 'just another slasher remake'.

2019-09-17T14:46:27,"Seriously? They just remade this in 2006. They don't need another remake this soon. It's not even that great of a horror movie to begin with. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Ok. So this is not a remake. Change the freakin name then! You are leading people on with this title. But I see what you are doing though. Black is equated with black magic and ritual sacrifices, which is what this movie appears to be about. However, you can still find another title that doesn't relate to the other 2 movies that involve murder and mayhem at a sorority at Christmas time. Call it ""Bloody Christmas"" or ""Sorority Christmas"" or ""Ritual Christmas"" or ""Satanic Christmas."" Any of those titles would be better. You didn't really hide what the movie is about in the trailer so associating the main title with satanic rituals is not really going to spoil anything further. It really doesn't matter anyway because this one is going to bomb big at the box office.

I just hope one day that people will realize that sometimes you should give scary movies a break for it's the season to be joy not scary things.
