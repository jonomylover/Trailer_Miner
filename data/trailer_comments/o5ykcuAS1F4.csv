I myself have always believed the sexes to be unequal as well. My mom as well as all mothers and wives rule the world in my eyes and always will. They do not give birth and walk away in my world,unlike the man ( dad, father figure ) what have you. Never had a dad so that's prolly why I view it this way, but as much as a man looks better as president in my opinion, it's also in my opinion that the first lady controls the president. For those that are dominant male boss type dudes who runs his house his way with a submissive wife that waits on him and does what he says or takes orders from him..to that I say YOU need your ass kicked however many times you need till your ego is checked and you become more humble and appreciative of who's in your life. The one who controls the relationship loves the least. If your ok with that kind of relationship then I hope you meet someone like me so you can be brought down to the real pecking order so your not a scumbag your whole life. I'm not submissive in the least. I am a take charge kinda man and when I put my foot down and make a decision then you can bet money that any and all demands I make are considered after checking with the better half. Rules I make in my house are the Law period as long as she agrees and allows. Lol. But I do get to watch TV after I get home from work no matter what no questions asked. She's the kitchen cook ( only cuz we want to enjoy the food cooked in kitchen ) I'm the grill cook. It's like a 49-51 percent relationship tilted in her favor.
