I started watching yesterday, stopped came on here to watch the trailers and read the comments. They put me off totallyüôÉ.I had to finish the movie today. It was really beautiful and  the concept was great and of course Ryan is a great handsome actor. I loved the movie.  If a movie is good a trailer ""showing everything"" shouldn't affect it. I'm sure all of you have seen at least one or two movies  like 5 times and each time still loved it and didn't complain that since you already know how it starts and ends will not watch it. Theres movies which have epic trailers but the movie falls sub par and theres others with not very interesting trailers and doesn't promise much and the movie is AWESOME. This movie trailer only showed about 30% of what happens in the entire movie.
