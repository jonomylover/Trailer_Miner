Anne became a teacher and a writer and just like Jo she shrugged off her best friend but in the end both women get married to somebody😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I think in this day and age women are 100x more independent so the idea that there needs to be a narrative dragging marriage is unnecesaary. You dont even see that type sh*t in films anymore, not when u have female protagonists like Rey or Black Widow, etc. We have been out of the Damsel in Distress ages for yearrrrrssss. So i just feel like the loud message is SERIOUSLY unnecessary. I also dont like the fact that this film seems wayyyyyy too...”modern?” Too relaxed, as if a bunch of besties decided to film a college film project without taking time to learn the accents and behaviors from back in those days.

This completely side-tracks and subverts the narrative to fit into what we think the author should have meant when she was very clear, in order to fit with what we have now come to make of feminism and it bastardizes a complex, multi-themed, intricate, Bible-lengthed work of litterature and dresses it up as cheap street corner two cents feminism.... Uggggh! It's also porn for celebrity addicts who were dying to see all those actors together -hoorah great actors in a bad movie-, great way to pack the theaters : stars as bait a misleading title when in fact the wisdom of Louisa May Alcott is being butchered....  I hate our society. The novel criticises the very fabric of society, and consequently sexism as well as many other social behaviours that would make a few wine moms and basic girls feel self-conscious about themselves, it's clear they are simply trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator and teach nothing, merely repeating a few lines in an orwellian way, no one actually remebering what it means.",1,3,Brandon Laurence,AST2-4db4ic,0.00993055555555557,2019-08-15 06:30:47,True,True

Christian Bale was just perfect casting, he has all of it, plus if you read about Bale's life it is almost like he was Laurie. Laurie had a pianist mother and traveled a lot, Bale traveled most of his childhood with his mother's circus and with his father, an ex-pilot. Both Lauire and Bale led an artistic bohemian life at some point. Timothée has romanticism and tenderness, but not enough manhood, he looks like baby all the time.

The hair colors aren't even right, the personalities aren't right, the only thing they DID get was Laurie's unrequited love for Jo. And, judging by the trailer, they're going to try to weasel in too many storylines and it'll end up a jumbly mess. That was a problem I had with the book.  I'm not trying to say the book was perfect.

2019-08-18T21:24:55,"I think it’s a mistake for producers to cast actors who have romantic chemistry to portray Jo and Laurie. It makes way for romanticizing what _should not_ be romanticized; Jo doesn’t have any romantic feelings for Laurie at all, while Laurie doesn’t take “No” for an answer at first. Yet in the comments below, you see people gushing on about Jo/Laurie like they don’t see anything wrong with it.  Seriously, though, you wouldn’t find it nice if your best friend, whom you have no feelings for, proposed to you, and after saying “No,” he still tries to convince you, even though nothing _can_ convince you because you simply don’t have feelings for him. If you don’t have romantic feelings for someone, then you simply don’t.

Contact your local representatives and tell them to...  - Boycott food companies that accept and produce products from factory-style farms and agriculture (which is largely responsible for the clear cutting of the amazon forests and a huge percentage of greenhouse gas emissions.)  - deny products into you community that employ slave labour, illegal logging, and environmental degradation of land and water to produce their products. - Ban not only single use plastic bags. BAN single use plastic PACKAGING of products. Or tax them (the companies, not the people) - stop accepting donations and lobbying for fossil fuel companies.  That's not democracy if you just keep ass kissing to billionaire company interests. - subsidize local business and sustainable agriculture - subsidize green energy production like Solar, wind and geothermal energy. - promote healthier life styles. Ban car advertising in cities and promote public transit. - put pressure on federal budgets to take away from military and nvest in green energy. (OR, if your country is too proud/dependent of its military, promote a reforestation/agriculture program within the military.) - make investments into fossil fuel companies illegal and charge companies a fine for their continued ties with major oil and fossil fuel companies. - promote reforestation programs. - fine mines for every acre of forest and waterway they degrade through wreckless unsustainable strip-mining methods. - fine fisheries that abandon their fishing nets in the ocean.  Join the movement, fight the symptom of climate pollution. 71% of the world's green house gas emissions comes from just 100 companies.

The actors are all great in their own right but some of them don't make sense as these characters. It looks like they're going to have Florence Pugh play Amy throughout the entire film but that doesn't really work for the character. She's the youngest at 12 when first introduced. Her relationship with Laurie is supposed to begin as a one sided crush on her part, with him not really noticing her at all until they run into each other in Europe and she's a grown woman. Timothée Chalamet as Laurie doesn't really work either, at least not post time skip. He has a baby face, looks like he's 16 (which will work great for his role as the 15 year old Paul Atreides in Dune!).

She said it in response to her fans who kept asking why she finished the novel with Jo ending up with Friedrich instead of Teddy and how Jo choosing to keep her independence would still have been a better ending (I’ve seen this adaptation and it addresses and answers why Alcott had to end it that way.)

It unequivocally affirms my worst opinion of Rotten Tomatoes, which positively rates this movie at 95%.  This movie is all-round bad. Its poorly written script fundamentally changes the original story just to inject a ‘faux’ feminist overtone. So is its casting. In trying to distinguish it from previous movie adaptations (and presupposing its audience already knows the story), this movie randomly flips the timeline and sequence of events back-and-forth. Not only does it kill plot cohesion, it fails to give most actors a chance to develop their roles. Purporting to address the issue of feminism of this era (Massachusetts during the Civil War in 1860’s), it blasts marriage as merely an ‘economic proposition’, which is true - except it does so casually in 3 lines of one dialog.   In my view, the 1949 (Elizabeth Taylor) and 1994 (Susan Sarandon) adaptations of ‘Little Women’ are fantastic classics. Why they bother to make such an inferior one in 2019 really beats me.

Bet Orchard House was glad for publicity but cringed by the move. Huge disappointment.   Per the writings and letters of Louisa M Alcott, Marmee was the heart of the home and larger than life--as was Susan Sarandon but not Dern (miscast and also misunderstood Marmee).   The whole movie was very miscast. Watson unmemorable. Flat line delivery by sooooo many.   Chalamet s a brilliant actor and was trying to save the scenes. Ronan was interesting although also miscast and looked too old. As for Florence Pugh as Amy, a complete failure of understanding Alcott's Amy. And as for the ""Amy"" issue-- should have cast a young and older Amy.   What happened to the script doctors the whole thing needed retooling. A snore on the strange costume choices for the historic period. Durran was obviously going for an award instead of depicting a time period and tone reflective of the book, area, and author and especially the March family.  On an endnote, Alcott had the opportunity of writing letters to the general public to answer everyone's questions about the story and characters so why could they not respect her point of view?

2020-01-13T01:09:29,"In college, I read ""Little Women"".  In fact, I actually read the book 3 or 4 times before the age of 25.  The message within it's pages was clear, pristine and unsullied.  It was a message that I took to heart and carried with me throughout my adult life.  When I saw this film, all I could see was a political message dressed with a sweet vinaigrette of beautiful costumes, actresses known for their outspoken feminism and writing that went out of its way to oversow the message that Louisa May Alcott so exquisitely embroidered within the pages of her book.   The attempt to capture that delicate and elegant message was anything but delicate and elegant.  The feminist overtones reverberated throughout the film like a Norwegian death metal band trying to play ""Queen of the Night Aria"" from Mozart's, ""The Magic Flute.""  It just didn't work.    Stories as sublime as ""Little Women"" do not require any enhancement.  Otherwise, the power of the story vanishes.

One time she said that in this time of age where everybody is getting more freedom we should need to keep an order because that's is how the world could work properly, if everybody gets what they want the world would be in total chaos, which in a way I agree on. But last week she said something that for me is very triggering, she said that she cannot understand what is International Women's Month Celebration is all about. To her isn't women already experiencing and enjoying enough rights so why are they still having this celebration in the first place, why does it seem like they are wanting more? that's her mindset about it. But at that moment I really wanted to answer her but unfortunately I didn't have enough courage. I wanted to tell her that International Women's Month Celebration is all about celebrating being a woman. It is not about women wanting more rights, it is us celebrating the rights that we are currently enjoying which our predecessors did not get to enjoy. And she also added about how men does not have any ""Men's Month"" and it kinda reminded me of that post about normal people being angry of PWDs having their own parking space. It is like men have been enjoying their rights for as long as the world started and now that women are just starting to enjoy their own rights, people like this come and in a way invalidates them. I wanted to say to her face that ""ma'am International Women's Month Celebration is all about celebrating womanhood, femininity and being a woman, it is not us wanting more rights, it is us celebrating the rights that we are currently enjoying which the earlier generation did not able to enjoy. And if you're wondering why there isn't a Men's Month, may I just remind you that men had been in control and enjoying all of their rights since the beginning of time.""",0,0,grotesque Monalisa,AST2-4db4ic,0.19663865546218487,2020-03-14 03:46:00,False,True

She is nothing like the Amy character should be. The person that played Beth was not the beautiful sweet shy girl from the book or the movies before this.
