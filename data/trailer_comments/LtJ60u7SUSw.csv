2018-05-31T11:36:19,"This movie gives what I feel is an inaccurate representation of the American president Franklin Roosevelt. In one segment of the film it appears that Roosevelt is unwilling to help the U.K. during this ""darkest hour"". Quite the opposite is true. If Churchill was alive he would be the first to acknowledge that Roosevelt was doing all he could to override the American congress which was opposed to America's entry into the war. The U.S.A. as a result of Roosevelt's urging DID in fact provide the destroyers that Churchill wanted as well as the planes and a lot more. Roosevelt pushed through Lend Lease which allowed the USA to provide military hardware as well as food and medicine to Great Britain long before America's entry into the war. He also brokered a deal with the American congress to enact the Atlantic Charter which allowed American forces to defend against German attacks on British shipping far out into the Atlantic. It is suggestive of Churchill's gratitude to Roosevelt and the U.S.A. that the American 'Battle Hymn Of The Republic' was sung at his funeral service in Saint Paul's Cathedral a result of Churchill's expressed wish before he died.",0,0,DATo DATonian,LtJ60u7SUSw,0.121875,2018-05-31 11:36:19,False,False

2018-06-12T13:31:38,"At his greatest in 1939-41 and 51-3 possibly till 54 the cynicism of the greatest  critics the Cambridge economists and whigs and the Oxbridge overseas and communists , has to be ignore. He took power and leadership with the German Army led by the 4th and 5th greatest generals in History,  ( Sailor) Guderain and Rommel ( my mother selection as the greatest) was sliding thru the impenetrable Belgians, hills and creeks like a knife thru butter. On the banks of Meuse near Verdun the Boch and SS were singing 'we are sailing'. The French Army was shaking and little more than clay although their fighting ranks and some offices were not going to surrender to the SS uniformed officers.  Churchill told the numbers of available Hurricanes and Spits was limited and had to be conserved. Asked what have we got a hundred of we can expend. The old 'Battles' arent really great crates. Tell the RAF  that the Battle squadrons are put their planes straight into ' Sailors' double stroy HQ. If necesary with the pilot onboard. Twenty went straight into the house, two doors down from the actual  HQ of Guderain. And the other priortiy targets are Rommel and SD chief, Reinhard Heindrich. 100 planes go straight for them when find were they are. Correct prioritisation and target identity by the UK and Commonwealths No 1 computer at the moment . The second critical order was the decision, six months later that they had to destroy the fleet of Britains, usually greatest ally France. He demanded the Admrials take their battleship and cruisers back on three seperate strikes over a  month to take out the French fleet who resisted with all guns and ships . That persuaded the hun supporting old Etonains and his old schoolmates and the little better US Congress and Public school boys that he had gutz. The other priceless calls early, was the first when appointed the 'Political' First sea lord- raise the Deflinger , throw its guns back on, put the Jack up and moore it on the Heinkels and ME200s flight path to Glasgow. A bit much for the British foreign office and press to do, but the Deflinger the High Seas fleet greatest battleship was certainly raised for armour. And of course with the Ajax, Exeter and little NZs  proud NZ branch navy HMS Archilles, the First Lord said send HMS Cumberland, Admiral Beatty xounty class heavy cruiser and unarmoured Baltimore or even battecruiser really - the ultimate and Fisher, Lillycrap and Tennyson d l' Court concept and really that of RN, we don't need armour if we need speed and range- with four turrets we can take theem. And the Cumberland , WSJ the First Lord realised, will make those colonials sweat.

Churchill is blamed for it because when he heard about it, he made a very nasty and racist comment about Indians saying ""it's their own fault because they breed like rabbits"". However, once he realised how bad the situation actually was in India, he did make efforts to alleviate it. For example, he convinced the Australians to ship 350,000 tones of wheat to India, and he wrote Roosevelt asking him to divert some transports (Roosevelt said he couldn't spare any). Churchill was known for making impulsive, nasty comments as a result of anger and stress, then realising he was wrong and trying to make amends. He may have had a dim view of Indians but it certainly wasn't in his nature to let people starve if he could prevent it.
