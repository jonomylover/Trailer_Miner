2018-11-18T17:11:39,"This is a trailer for a new film about school desegregation, taking place in Durham in 1971.  I like a lot of what's going on here; however, it's very important to notice how the racist antagonists are always portrayed as the White males.  The Klan leader's wife is the soft touch. His wife is trying to pull him back.  Not only is this historically inaccurate, this is a dangerous distortion of the racial and gender dynamics of school integration. We need to portray her saying, ""Look, Jim, you have to go out and keep our school safe. Protect our family.""  This notion that White woman were either confused or being dragged along by their husbands in maintaining school segregation is both historically inaccurate and dangerous.  Elizabeth Gillespie McRae, a historian who got her PhD from University of Georgia and is now working in North Carolina, just wrote a book on how from the 1920s to the 1970s, White women centrally drove Jim Crow and school segregation. The book is called Mothers of Massive Resistance.  White women drove school segregation as the rule, not the exception.  When I say that we don't understand the gender dynamics of racial degradation, and the inability to see White womanhood as formed as a strategy of racial control, this is what I mean.  We can't even portray them as a class of perpetrators of harm in fiction, and this is why we can't address the structures of the harm to this day.  This idea that White women are on the right side, we just have to get their husbands out of the way is fundamentally, wildly, and irresponsibly inaccurate.",102,19,Irami Osei-Frimpong - The Funky Academic,eKM6fSTs-A0,-0.012291912632821726,2018-11-18 17:11:39,True,True

Sure do but I also hate many of my own (white, not that I owe you an expllanation) and so many others. There are a lot of reasons to hate or dislike someone but skin tone is such an amateur excuse that it's laughable. I do not want to hate anymore though so I don't go around most people at this point in my life. Just can't deal with the drama. Eh, really though this race stuff isn't so important. It's about self esteem. Try getting some and the next time someone calls you something or they say they don't like you, maybe realise you don't care what they think.

2019-03-26T06:21:24,"during the Nixon Era.The Republican Party electoral strategy to increase political support among white voters in the South by appealing to racism against African Americans. As the Civil Rights Movement and dismantling of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s visibly deepened existing racial tensions in much of the Southern United States, Republican politicians such as presidential candidate Richard Nixon and Senator Barry Goldwater developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South to the Republican Party that had traditionally supported the Democratic Party. It also helped push the Republican Party much more to the right.  Many of the most right-wing Republican Senators starting in the 1970's were former Democrats like Jesse Helms of NC and Strom Thurmond of SC.  In fact, Strom Thurmond was the leader of the Dixiecrats in the Presidential race in 1948.  What was once a solidly Democratic region, became staunchly Republican by 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan.  From 1964 onwards, a strong majority of white southerners in particular, abandoned the Democratic Party and started voting Republican for President and Senatorial candidates especially. Eventually, most governors and congressmen were being elected as Republicans to the point that in many congressional districts, there were no Democrats running.  Today, the Democrats have a lot of work to do to become competitive in the south and border states.  Fortunately, the country's demographics are changing which should benefit Democrats.  African-American voters are the backbone of the Democratic Party in the South and young college-educated people.  With the rise of the Latino votes, this is going to make the Democrats far more competitive in future elections.  The GOP is unable and unwilling to broaden the base of their party and to moderate their views on issues that most people support and they don't.",1,0,Matheus Macedo,eKM6fSTs-A0,0.16387755102040816,2019-03-26 06:21:24,True,True

I was in the second grade at East End Elementary School when it caught on fire in 1962. We did finish the remaining school year in shifts. There was no Durham Elementary School as depicted in the movie. Holloway Street School was located at Holloway Street and N. Hyde Park Avenue. The next school year starting the 3rd grade, my next door neighbor's parents sent him to the white Holloway Street Elementary in 1963 instead of East End. Entering the 10th grade in the fall of 1970, court ordered school desegregation occurred in Durham and I was forced to attend the once white Durham High School instead of the black Hillside High School. There were no yellow school buses in Durham City Schools. We rode Duke Transit buses to school or walked. Also the landmarks in this movie were fake and not filmed in Durham. The entire movie was filmed in Georgia. They should have filmed landmarks and buildings of Durham. Most of this movie was fiction and they didn't get the clothes right or the years. This movie was a flop at the box office because  most people are tired of depressing films dealing with racism and segregation. I remember dealing with racism and racist white teachers at Durham High. I am glad I left the Bull City in 1973  and moved up North to live and attend college.
