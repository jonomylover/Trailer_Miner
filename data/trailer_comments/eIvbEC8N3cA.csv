Now the bodysnatchers conform more to expectations of what a crazy cultish black person would be like instead of what a crazy cultish white person would be like because it helps them blend in with the sort of counterculture they need to take new victims more easily. I'm operating under the possibility that maybe the origin of the weird family of bodysnatchers in Get Out were never even human to begin with and took those white people's bodies as well when they were younger.

2019-02-21T22:03:44,"Hollywood Left doing _everything_ they can to generate racism as they feel the country slipping out of their grasp, as blacks are leaving the Democrat party, and figuring out that non-leftists have no problem with them, just with the Left.  But... this is all Hollywood can do.  Their pathetic screen-magic.  The internet ruins it.   They weren't desperate enough to resort to having a black person terrorize a bunch of white teenagers 5 years ago.  It's too un-PC.  They're slipping.  They're desperate.  But this isn't going to work.    Here's what they're trying to do, and how.  In addition, obviously to making white people afraid of black people, they're actually trying to get black people to do stuff like this.  I've never seen this movie; have never heard of it.  But I can almost guarantee that somewhere in the movie they'll reveal that the reason the lady is doing this crazy shit, is because she's 'getting revenge' because the kids' parents were racist to her when _she_ was in school.     This idea they thereby implant into a nation in which a whole lot of black people do feel resentful of white privilege and systemic racism and so forth.  But they  aren't doing this kind of crazy shit.  But you show people, and some of them go out and do it; that's human nature.  You implant the idea, 'yeah, I'm gonna get revenge on their kids like that lady did; reparations are a bitch!'  That kind of thing.  That's what they want.    Their whole party platform of saving the minorities from the bad white people requires the minorities to not be getting along all buddy-buddy with the supposedly bad white people.  They need racial tensions.    Do you think they really want to solve race relations?  These people eat babies.  They have 'kill rooms' in their houses, decorated with artwork of cannibalism and torture/murder.  Just look up the Podesta house artwork, for a quick and easy proof of who the Illuminati are.  And Hollywood is a primary Illuminati control industry.  They need to constantly create the problem so they can sell the solution.  Their platform is selling the solution.  And somehow, their solution to race relations problems always seems to be to pit the races against each other.  Isn't that odd.   They're very smart.  They know they can _say_ races should get along, but if they do it by pitting the groups against each other, they know they are affecting the opposite outcome.  They know that.  They intend that.    Ashkenazi IQ is a full standard deviation above the human mean.  What's this movie going to gross, a few million $?  National/global sentiment control grosses the whole human race as a slave colony, tens of trillions of dollars in yearly productivity.  But they're not after money; they invented modern money; they control it completely.  They own/run all banks, regulatory agencies, and central reserve banks, control interest rates, control when and if new money is printed and how much.  Money flow is just one of their main tools.  It's the control itself, of humanity, that they play for.    This tiny little inconsequential movie is just a blip out of thousands.  But it's an outlier in it's plot.  That makes it a noteworthy part of a pattern, perhaps signalling a shift in general tactics.  Perhaps just testing the waters.  I just want people to begin to learn to read the patterns.  To see the 'matrix.'  It's in thousands of little details that you'll see but don't notice everyday.  They almost always show their hand; that's intentional.",0,0,brindlebriar,eIvbEC8N3cA,-0.05923491830749896,2019-02-21 22:03:44,True,True

She couldn't get over it and tried to reenact her teenage years with a bunch of teenagers (who happen to be the children of the teens she met/knew, coincidently or planned), she gets attached and the more they feel uncomfortable the more hostile she becomes because she's once in her life felt popular and got to do the things she wanted to do in high school; because now she has friends who she gets to talk to, boys she gets to flirt with, people she gets to party with. Not only that, because of her age, she has power over them. I.e., the ability to buy alcohol and have a place of her own to keep them back because that's what teenagers like, BUT there's the upstairs... it could only lead to her bedroom where she has the same room as them, decorated with pictures of her teenage years AND pictures of people from school.

I don't think this movie is doing anything to make black people look better OR worse, it's just a movie and I think some folks are just finding things to be mad at at this point for likes. This shit actually really bothers me. When activists first took to social media to spread awareness about things genuinely worth being upset about, and cultivated this culture of people being able to speak out against injustice and actually be heard, none of us thought it would devolve into people just calling everything problematic like y'all do now.

Quite a shame too, because I had high expectations for this one, considering Blumhouse Productions is responsible for The Purge, Happy Death Day, Get Out, Insidious series and much more. Well, I was wrong. The only good thing was Octavia Spencer herself who was MA. She was phenomenal and practically made the movie her bitch. If it wasn‚Äôt for her, the movie would‚Äôve been extremely uncomfortable to watch. Every time I saw her on the screen, I was engaged, but everybody else were just random actors I didn‚Äôt even know and they sucked. It took like a good hour just to have a realistic build up. Ridiculous. And I thought it was supposed to be scary? It‚Äôs not scary at all. Nothing scary in it. Just predictable cheap jump scares that try so hard to scare you, but fail. The story was falling off too much. There were parts where I was locked in, but then the locked in part stops and it gets really boring all of a sudden. The last 20 minutes was the only good part of the movie. It‚Äôs really hard to believe that this was produced by Blumhouse. Blumhouse? What I just saw was definitely not a Blumhouse movie, because I know that Blumhouse can do a way scarier and better job than that.",0,0,JaxPrice Films,eIvbEC8N3cA,-0.0013333333333333272,2019-06-10 04:15:57,False,True

2019-06-10T22:45:18,"Highly disappointing! In no way had the peers of Octavia Spencer's (Ma's) character duly justify Ma's ""mental illness"",  properly. Towards the middle of this film, Ma is met by the father to one of the teens she frequently invites to her house parties, and soon realizes he was her junior high/high school crush. When he exposes her illegal doings, he adds a remark to her that she was always a weirdo, and nothing had changed... The problem with that is there were never any justifications on his behalf to indicate that she was ""touched"".. Matter of fact; her flashback depicts that she was the scapegoat after her classmates discover she has a crush on a boy in her class. They set her up to believe she was gonna make out with the boy in a janitors closet; only to exploit her, causing shame on her when she realizes the girls in her class set her up to give oral to the nerdy kid in class... So, as far as I can perceive this film; Ma's character was and is the victim of possible racism, only to be forced to believe SHE is the problem, all for the sake of maintaining ""political correctness"" within the white community! I hope persons of color both young and old, realize this fact, and do not fall victim to irrational labeling of one's character based on how he, or she looks.",0,0,Lynda E,eIvbEC8N3cA,-0.08235294117647057,2019-06-10 22:45:18,False,True

2019-09-01T05:51:57,"For those who will never watch the movie: Octavia's Sue Ann was the victim of a nasty, emotionally traumatizing prank.  While I am absolutely against bullying of all forms (except maybe cyberbullying), it doesn't justify Sue Ann's actions and decisions in this movie.  Different people may have different perspective, but in my eyes, Sue Ann is a person who was incapable of leaving her past behind her, and moving on.  A lot of people get bullied in school, and/or are the ""fly-on-the-wall"" introvert who no one notices.  But none of that is an excuse to try and live out a teenage dream that you missed out on.  It's bad enough being a grown-ass adult wanting to party with teenage kids.  Even worse is putting your own child in a cage to ""protect"" her from living and experiencing both the good and bad of life.  And once you resort to torturing kids for not wanting to party with you, you've gone past the point of no return.   An older person wanting to hang out with a younger group is not inherently bad, but there are a few factors which result in it being a bad idea.  Generation gap, differing viewpoints, different interests, different habits, etc.  As an adult who plays video games, I have to deal with the reality that 1) There will be people in my age group who do not like/play all the video games that I play and have played.  Hell, whatever dudes I hung out with in the recent past, not even my tastes in music EVER aligned with their's.  And younger gamers, forget it.  All they want to play is Fortnite or whatever online multiplayer game will be popular next.  It also doesn't help that I am Indian-American, and that majority of Indians my age do not play video games, and most would think I am ""childish"" for still playing video games.  So, ultimately, I fit in nowhere, and I'm ok with that.  I get more personal satisfaction from my video games and music, movies, and TV shows, than I could ever get from going to a bar on weekends and wasting my money getting drunk or whatever stupid shit that ""normal"" people do.",0,0,Corvo Attano,eIvbEC8N3cA,-0.07095385674931129,2019-09-01 05:51:57,False,False

2019-11-20T20:29:52,"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, poem in seven parts by¬†Samuel Taylor Coleridge¬†that first appeared in¬†Lyrical Ballads, published by Coleridge in 1798. The title character detains one of three young men on their way to a wedding feast and mesmerizes him with the story of his youthful experience at sea‚Äîhis slaughter of an¬†albatross, the deaths of his fellow sailors, his suffering, and his eventual redemption. In this poem , the romantic features are all achieved with a touch from coleridge , which is supernaturality.   An old sailor stopped one person out of a group of three. The person said that the sailor had a grey ‚Äì coloured beard and shining eyes. He asked him that why had he stopped him.   The person was going to a wedding. He said to the sailor that the doors of the bridegroom‚Äôs house had been opened which indicated that the ceremony was about to begin. As he was a family member, he was in a hurry. All the guests had already arrived and the dinner had been laid. The wedding music could also be heard. # this archives the loneliness of the romantic poets. Even though their is a wedding and a celebration, the marnier seems alone and not caring about all these noises of the city and prefers to speak about a memory about nature insted.  The sailor held the wedding guest with his thin hand and began to speak. He wanted him to hear his story. He started to speak and had only said that there had been a ship when the wedding guest interrupted him. He called him a mad man with a grey beard and ordered him to take his hand off him. The next moment, the sailor removed his hand from the person.   The wedding guest sat on a stone. He had no other option than to hear the mariner‚Äôs story. Finally, the bright ‚Äì eyed mariner started narrating his story.",0,0,ahmed khashe,eIvbEC8N3cA,0.006250000000000001,2019-11-20 20:29:52,False,False
