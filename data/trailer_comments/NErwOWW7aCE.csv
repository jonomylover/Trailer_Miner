2018-08-26T20:45:55,"This was an okay comedy/action movie, but nothing special, and it was at least a decade too late. Most Millennials don't know or care about the CHIPS tv show. On a sidenote: it had one of the most pointless and gratuitous male full frontal nudity scenes in a comedy.  I think it was just an example of Dax looking for an excuse to show off his physique and dong. I listen to his podcast and he's actually admitting to going out of his way to flash it in the past because it's one of the few physical attributes he's proud of (paraphrasing). Bizarrely enough, they chose that awkward scene as one of the main preview clips used during Dax and Pena's tv promotional appearances, which was an ill advised move as it was more likely to turn people away.",0,0,Eagle Knight,NErwOWW7aCE,0.032900432900432895,2018-08-26 20:45:55,False,False
