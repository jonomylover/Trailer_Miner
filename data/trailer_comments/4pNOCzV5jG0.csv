When the Polish government started executing german immigrants the sombre nation (Germany) was provoked into a bankers war where the only winner were the banks where they could fund both sides and receive benifits from selling eachside guns tanks munitions and other waring tools to capitalise on.

2018-01-28T09:52:00,"That movie is only a pathetic propaganda story without any sense of historical reality. There was never real accurate risk that the NSDAP Germany and the Axis could conquer Britannia, because the Britannia¬†was and is still today¬†very easy to defend and very difficult to conquer. Besides the Royal Navy was much stronger and much powerful than the relatively weak German Kriegsmarine. Winston Churchill himself told that he was during the WWII only little worried about the German¬†Kriegsmarine U-boat submarines. He was never worried that Germany could conquer Britannia, because it was very unrealistic and Germany had not enough naval and air force military power to seriously thereat Britannia and Adolf Hitler and all his military commanders knew it too. Hitler and the German NSDAP government wanted desperately fair peace treaty with Britannia and probably only because the WWI lost areas of the German Empire back in Europe. Hitler never wanted conquer the world and to the Soviet Union he attacked practically only because the German modern army needed desperately mush¬†more oil than Germany was possible to get. Then the Royal Air Force was too nearly as strong as Luftwaffe and the RAF had huge military strategy advantage, because they were defending Britannia, which is a big Atlantic Ocean island near Europe. The German pilots who were shot down alive¬†were arrested¬†and transported to the British war prisoner camps when the British pilots who were shot down alive returned soon back to flying. Britannia is a natural sea fortress commonly as a country, very easy to defend.¬†Winston Churchill was¬†by the way personally¬†a white race¬†supremacist, who though that the human rights belong to the white race only, especially to the white British people. He wanted that the¬†colonial power of the British Empire lasts forever and the white race British people shall rule it forever as the master race.¬†He liked Benito Mussolini and he liked even Adolf Hitler, before he realized that¬†the NSDAP government in Germany is simply too good and too effective to ""Make Germany Great Again"". Only few years of Adolf Hitler¬¥s and the NSDAP¬¥s ¬†power in Germany made¬†Germany¬†again the leading economics in Europe together with Britannia. Winston Churchill only saw again rising German¬†economic and industrial power a serous threat to the¬†interests of¬†Britannia, just like he saw¬†the rising German Empire¬¥s economic, industrial and¬†military power a threat to¬†Britannia before the WWI. Well, the British Empire collapsed quite soon after the WWII Pyrrhic victory and that old fool practically only helped the Stalin¬¥s Soviet Union and the Red Army to conquer and occupy half Europe and to force it to under brutal communistic dictatorship, when Germany and the Axis¬†allies were defending bourgeois¬†civilized Europe against¬†communism and communistic terror. Many people here in continental¬†Europe remember so¬†well¬†what that¬†Winston Churchill did. He¬†was not a hero, only a bombastic¬†nationalistic¬†old fool and a British white race supremacist, in his own fantasy world, without sense of political realism and traditional¬†common sense.¬†He disliked Adolf Hitler only because they both wanted to make¬†their countries great. There¬†were simply¬†two bombastic¬†nationalistic great divas and landscape view art painters at the political theatre stage of¬†Europe during that time, Adolf Hitler and Winston Churchill. Only real difference between them¬†was family background. Winston Churchill did born to¬†one of the wealthiest British aristocracy family in the most bombastic private palace in Britannia when Adolf Hitler was a son of an average lower middle class family and a real WWI¬†Imperial German Army war hero with the 1st class and the 2th class Iron Cross military honour medals. Adolf Hitler¬†was too one of the historical founding¬†fathers of the European¬†welfare state thinking together with the Chancellor¬†Otto von Bismarck of the¬†German Empire before him and the Prime Minister Tage Erlander of Sweden after the WWII.¬†Hitler was a friend of the worker class people in Germany, a nationalistic socialist (social democrat),¬†when Winston Churchill deeply disliked the British working class people and the British Labour Party. He even compared in his public radio speech the¬†Labour¬†Party to the NSDAP Gestapo¬†before the parliamentary election in Britannia after Germany surrendered in Europe though millions of working class young men had just¬†fought, wounded¬†and died¬†for¬†Britannia at the WWII.¬†Surprise,¬†Winston Churchill¬†and the Tory-party lost the election.¬†Greetings from Northern Europe, Finland! :)",0,0,GBOY69GAY,4pNOCzV5jG0,0.049437069813176,2018-01-28 09:52:00,False,True
