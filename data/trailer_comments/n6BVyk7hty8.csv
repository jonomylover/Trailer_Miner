2016-09-13T22:15:58,"Most waste of time movies ever i mean our era has lost the plot making this kind of stuff into movies and books, it's a nice idea and fatnasy to meet someone we can completely lose control with like this but sadly we will lose ourselves, our sanity and everything that is good about us and become so jaded, although i'm still gonna watch it but... only once and that's it, this second one actually looks better than the first, i like the concept of how far too many people especially fellow women try to change people instead of accepting them for what they are and this is what both of them are doing especially Christian but... i doubt he could ever have a healthy relationship with anyone, he is unfixable.  Plus people that are far too gone you can't save them... people will also try to goad you into trying to change them to live life expecting everyone to change for you and that's not a good mind set to live by, it's your own personal conflict and hell, i see how it effects our kind of society these days, perhaps at least people will learn a thing or two about peoples degrading, self-obsorbed and self-harming behaviors and habits and how they don't just hurt themselves but other people, or probably not... lol i won't hope on that. It's understandable though how people can become so involved with such people because we search all our lives to find someone who can get under our skin in such a way but not in a bad way, a very good way, but if you aren't careful you get roped in by such people like Christian Grey and the conflict is just simply unreal when we meet someone like this, you know it's very wrong but yet your body and mind is just driving you to stay their slave, it's a complete moral and ethical battle, uhh... i'm sure we've all been there, if you haven't, run for your freaking life lol.",0,0,FlyingMonkies325,n6BVyk7hty8,0.1382610993657505,2016-09-13 22:15:58,True,True

He can't help it if this is what sexually arouses him. And I'm pretty sure she did research on the whole BDSM thing so she should have an pretty good idea that it's not butterflies and rainbows. Also, Christian was trying REALLY hard not to show her his ""dark side"" because he knew that's how she would react. But nooo she just had to pressure him into showing her ""the worst"". -sigh- I also don't understand what's so appealing about Ana. Yeah it's probably the whole naive, ""innocent virgin(not anymore)"" thing, but there wasn't really any chemistry between them. And it took a fancy plane ride for her to get all happy and shit about their ""relationship"". Idk what I was expecting. It's a pretty good movie if you're looking for smutty scenes I guess but Christian and Ana's relationship? Eh, it could use some work. I guess we'll just have to see how it progresses. (Did anyone else feel bad for that Jose character, who's main purpose was to just have a crush on Ana so that Christian could save her from him?)",0,0,Jessica Vo,n6BVyk7hty8,0.04428571428571429,2016-09-14 01:16:38,True,True

You find out what Christian has experienced in his childhood and how he got to the world he's in with his adopted family, only knowing the world he was seduced into to by Ms Lincoln when he was a teen!  While Ana experiences alot of first with Christian, Christian in turn experiences some of his firsts with Ana! He may have exceeded in his business life, he's emotionally behind in his personal life! His childhood trama, experienced with his real Mom and her pimp stopped his emotional growth! That trama stayed with him, even as his new Mom and family who adopted him came into his life was loving and supportive of him! Ana was a unexpected surprise to Christian and that all changed when their relationship stopped! She opened up in him the possibility of more and that is where book 2 starts! Two people in love and finding a way to open up, be vulnerable and communicate with each other! I think alot of people relate to that!  The trailer looks fantastic, looks like their giving the fan's what they want and in the end, yes we're intrigued! Wonder what that next trailer will bring when it hits! I believe Darker will deliver on the sexy romance and as a thriller because that is what book 2 was, that's what really brought the fan's in, in the end it's at its heart a love story between Ana and Christian!

Then she figures out that it takes a lot of practice to fit a fist in an anus.  so the romantic preparation scene will be her trying to fit progressively larger objects into her ass while buddy tries to find the right lubricant and deciding that only classic nasa grade astroglide will do.  By the end of this movie he'll either propose that she be a toilet slave or propose that she become his lobotomized  slave.  Either way... it's gonna be poopy.

They only go into the playroom once and it is very water downed from what they did in the book. The point is for Christian to get Ana back, but without all of that kinky sex. Just regular sex. He wants a NORMAL relationship like she does. You know to be BOYFREIND AND GIRLFREIND. 2. The second and third book is more of a ""thriller"" than an erotic romance novel. Yes, there is still sex; But they are focusing more on the people coming into their lives and trying to keep them apart. For example Mrs. Robinson (Kim Basinger and the lady who introduced Christian to the lifestyle in the first place), Jack Hyde (Ana's Boss) and Lelia Williams (Christians former ex submissive).

2016-09-16T01:40:35,"What pisses me off is this movie makes it look like it'll be like Eyes Wide Shut... and I know it's going to be nothing like that.  There's not going to be some massive orgy scene... there's not going to be anything thrilling or interesting.  It's just about an abusive billionaire sociopath and his latest victim and there's going to be some contrived bullshit where, in the next movie, he ""changes his ways"", and you're not going to see the follow-up where he starts playing his little games with the main character and eventually breaks her emotionally because he can.  Let's be real, he's not a dom, he's just a sociopath who uses the guise of kinky sex as an excuse to abuse the ever-loving fuck out of his victims until they are broken.  See, if the movies went in that direction, it would actually be an interesting movie... so that's how we know it's NOT going to go in that direction because its Twilight DNA is so strong that anything interesting that might come into it would, at best, just get scrubbed away, but more than likely will NEVER happen.",0,0,Sean Strife,n6BVyk7hty8,0.1351190476190476,2016-09-16 01:40:35,True,True

I sometimes text with my ex-girlfriend just because we're friends But if you don't want me to speak with her, I'll make sure it ends I can be somewhat untidy and sometimes I make a mess But if you ask ""Do I look good in this dress?""  I will say ""Yes.""  I only eat spaghetti, hamburgers and pizza I have a picture of me leaning against the croocked tower of Pisa If I do not pluck my eyebrows they will grow to one I know the entire lyrics to Celine Dions ""My Heart Will Go On"" I squeeze the mayonnaise tube right here in the middle I forget the toilet seat, and Ringo is my favourite Beatle I have every episode of ""Teen mom"" on my PVR And I collect all of my tonails in this jar  I have a dream to one day become a famous superstar And there's a homeless man named Greg that is living in my car  Hope this doesn't scare you away from us two becoming one 'Cuz we'll gave a lot of love And this crappy song  - Wow, that's lot to process. I didn't know... There is a Greg in your car? Well, I appreciate the honesty. So...  I have a diamond jeweled pink iPhone encasement Chronic flatulence and a boy in my basement If I drink I turn sexist and I can be a prick But I will try my utmost not to ne like that, now suck my dick I sometimes cry when I watch a super duper touching movie I put my cat - and I think that Nickelback is super groovy I've had like fifty girlfriends before we met each other Let's say like fiftyone, if we include your mother I have so many things on my heart that I gotta say I hate laughter, and your sexface makes me sort of gay I know it's harsh but honesty, that is what I'm all about I don't eject the USB before I plug it out Sometimes I swap babies in the hospital just for fun And right now under here I'm pointing at you with loaded gun I hope you still want to be my one 'Cuz we'll have a lot of love And this crappy song!  - I don't know if I can...  I am a wizard and my best friend is a goose named Peter Sometimes I wet the bed, but mainly I am a bed shitter If I get bored I pay my twinbrother to hang with you Actually I am him right now, hello my name is Stu  I have a family of martians hiding in my attic My dad's also my unclebrother and I am a 1D fan I was a she, but took a sexchange just to be with you I have 11 pairs of crocks and a YOLO tattoo I sometimes breastfeed sleeping hoboes, then I run away I stole the ""Z"" from crazy, so that we could just say cray I might look young, but I am 120 years 'Cuz I sold my soul to Satan and inject myself with baby tears I hope you wanna be my girl for all eternity Cut of my hand, together we can rule the galaxy If you don't stop me this song is gonna last forever And is it ever gonna take off?

The whole thing is about the power of love, how Ana changes Christian's perspective of his life. He is in this way because he was traumatised when he was young (crack mother), but Ana comes in and dissolves/ breaks down all the walls around him. I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT JUST A FILM ABOUT PORN. Its an incredibly romantic story because of the development of the characters, and how Christian learns to love and be loved. Stop trashing this story without trying to gain respect for its literature intentions.
