Q:Why is Amy not there?     A:If you go on imdb, it says that Jayma Mays couldn't be in this movie because it wasn't fitting with her schedules on Glee. Maybe she'll be mentioned, but she will not be physically there. 3. Q:Why are they still fat?     A:THE QUESTION... I think that it's an important base for the movie.
