But i'm not gonna deny that it is possible that this could be the best FOX X-men movie ever. Fack, watching this is kinda feels weird to call it a X-men film. Even tough it's about Logan aka Wolverine aka Anti Yellow Spandex Guy movie... Jesus, this looks like a solid pice of film right here. It's darker, more mature and sad. Just what you expect from a X-men film. This is the latest in the timeline of the X-men movies. And probably will remain that for a few years now since Logan is the only one that exist in the future right now. The rest exist back in the old days. The next X-men movie will probably be set in the 90's. And after there the early 2000's? This takes place way after Days of Future Past wich i do believe took place in the future. Like still a good few years in the future. But i'm pumped for this... I expect this to be a very emotional film to watch. It's the end of Wolverine. It's the last time we see him. And it's probably going to mark the end of Professor X. Seeing them all so old and broken down. It's hard.... But yeah. It's odd! I really hope they don't try and recast the role for many years. They will do it at some point. But for now i hope they'll simply introduce X23 as a stand in. And it may very well be that the girl in the film is X23? I don't know... Haven't read into the film to much. And if she is X23 i want to be supprsied when i see the film. But yeah... Jesus. Such a magical trailer. For those saying they are getting thired of Superhero movies. To that i say i don't get how. Because Superhero movies can cover anything. Comedy like Deadpool. Just good old Superhero fun like The Avengers. Spy action thriller like Captain America. Crime thriller drama with The Dark Knight and now a way more personal action drama with Logan. I mean you can do anything with Superheroes as long as you dare to do it. You can even do a musical... Hell Jackman has allready pitched Wolverine the Musical so why not? But i'm hyped about this film. I see real potential here for a Superhero movie that could get a Oscar. You know... I actually hope this film gets an Oscar simply because it's the end of an era.

I'm seeing way too much last of us and let his powers again statements for my brain to tolerate. if anything the last of us ripped the concept from the original comic this is based on years and years ago. he didn't lose his powers. they are degrading with time. he does age and does die. it just happens so significantly slower than everyone else. I'm not positive but I also believe the more his powers are used especially to extremes such as reincarnation like events, radioactive contact, Jean ripping him apart, and other very traumatic incidents over his life; he ages and loses his powers faster. this is for fans of wolverine. if you're not a fan or have only seen the movies, you won't get it. so either don't see it or go do some research. this is a send off to probably the best actor to ever play wolverine even if the movies weren't always what they should be. this is for the fans of a beloved character.",2,0,Justin Reid,gbug3zTm3Ws,0.16841856060606059,2016-10-20 15:26:17,True,True

2016-10-22T15:45:34,"Based on the reception of this trailer.... Movie tops 500 Million. Combine that with the fact that this is the last time people will see the wolverine as played by Jackman and the professor as played by Stewart,... probably another 200 million. If this movie has a tear jerker story(which looks to be the case) that sends wolverine off in a blaze of blood and blade while allowing him to pass the torch.... I'm calling the first Fox superhero film to cross a billion dollars. IF.... the story is unforgettable.   It looks like Wolverine and Xaviers last attempt at a homeschool for gifted youngsters...and all their hope in one student. To be honest.... the trailer has the makings of a masterpiece in itself. If the movie is a quarter as good as the trailer makes it look it will be the one that cements Hugh Jackman in our memories.   It would be one that would make the jumbled Xmen/Fox timeline irrelevant because of its quality. Just a good wolverine movie, it would be hailed as the one he has always deserved, regardless of when it took place in that franchise. Deadpool already mentioned how confusing they were anyway :p   I am very mixed on the whole Wolverine issue... I think Jackman did a good job with the material he had. I didn't like all of them, but he always gave Wolverine his all. He has been Wolverine for like 17 years.   He is partially responsible for the popularity that modern comic book movies have today. The money made from X-men and Spiderman back in those days allowed Marvel the financial breathing room to expand to what we see today.   Hugh was kinda the Robert Downey Jr. for the cgi era of comic book movies. He got on board when people first realized that all the advancements in movie making tech could be used to make some bad ass superhero flicks. There are numerous flops in this category though. I wouldnt exactly say the pool has been littered with quality choices.  That's what I really like about this. Hugh is one of the first of our modern film superheroes. He came in with a bang and it looks like he is gonna go out with one. I am expecting a hell of a performance from both he and Patrick Stewart who I will also dearly miss seeing as the professor.  Thanks to Both these fine actors for their long standing portrayal of the greatest mind in the mutant universe, and the ol' canucklehead.",1,0,DetachedOnlooker,gbug3zTm3Ws,0.22864583333333338,2016-10-22 15:45:34,True,True

2016-10-25T23:43:53,"Okay. Here's my guess just from the trailer. The girl is his daughter, hence all the foreshadowing. Charles is somehow back in the world but he's dying for the last time (not sure how he survived at all but let's forget that logic). He's brought the girl to Logan, however she's probably being chased down by Metal hand and the bad guys. She's a mutant in a world where mutants can't be trusted. And Charles brings her to Logan because he can't look after her any longer. Could she even be Jene and Logan's child? Who knows! But the scene where Logan is carrying Charles is him just about to die, and the end of the movie is Charles dying before uttering the words ""Logan, you still have time"". Then Logan will go off with the girl in that final scene and it will be a fitting end to the Xmen franchise. And yes I said the franchise. If they're going to make a grounded, emotional movie then close on it! Enough of the spin offs and past movies. This is the close to the 2000 movie that we need, Logan getting a new start and the end for the Xmen.

2017-02-17T03:46:02,this looks good....but again a lot of feminist bullshit. another example of liberal Hollywood trying to replace a strong male character with a female clone. it's bad enough this female character was changed in the comic books from an original badass character that was similar to Wolverine into a cookie cutter derivative female  Woverine just to please the PC crowd. Now we have to see it film too? I mean I'm sure this is going to be a lot better than the last Ghostbusters and the force awakens amongst other sjw female re-hashes. but still they're going essentially kill off this version of Wolverine and replace with some awkward looking little girl. yea its following cannon but I'd much rather would've preferred another male Wolverine with another actor then this. its too soon for this change. why can't writers create brand new female characters instead of remaking older ones  as women for political reasons? it's so childish and lazy.,0,0,James Matthews,gbug3zTm3Ws,0.006655844155844159,2017-02-17 03:46:02,True,True

2017-03-01T20:34:13,I had just came home from seeing the movie at the cinema (that's what the big screen premiere is called where I am) and I can honestly say that it is the greatest and best film that is in the entire X-Men/Wolverine Movie franchise. I will even go as far as to say that it's the best movie that I have seen in my entire life (just so you know I'm 18yrs old). Hugh Jackman is literally THE Wolverine. He's irreplaceable. I don't think that there's a single person on this planet that can top what Hugh Jackman has done to The Wolverine Character. As for Laura/X-23 I really would like to see more of her. I really hope that they continue the story with her because I would love to see her grow older and evolve more and more into the female version of The Wolverine. What I'm pretty much trying to say here is that if you guys are a fan of the X-Men/Wolverine franchise I can guarantee you guys that you will love this film.

You know, the characters of color who are only there to help out the protagonist by providing some sort of words of wisdom or being oh so helpful only to then be killed not too long after. If you've seen the movie you know which characters I am talking about. This clich√© did not stop me from enjoying the film but I think that it's a completely over used trope that needs to be forever gone.",4,2,RagingRaven88,gbug3zTm3Ws,0.18181818181818182,2017-03-20 02:14:40,False,True
