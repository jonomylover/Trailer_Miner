It wasn't that bad.  I don't think it's one of the best movies of 2017, there were a few flaws. There was some over-the-top acting (I kind of like it, I think that was the point so I wouldn't really call it a flaw) but some of the humour was a bit too pushy on the audience.   I liked how they represented the girls as crazy wild badasses who take drugs, and the guys as quiet and emotional, sipping wine. It's strange, but I'll take it! It's a comedy, after all.  I don't praise feminist movies, I don't think they're funny at all and are just a waste of time.
