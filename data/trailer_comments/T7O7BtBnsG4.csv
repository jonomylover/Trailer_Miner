'When 400,000 Men Couldn't Get Home' is a good tagline and all BUT I should point out that while the British Expeditionary Force made out the bulk of those lucky to be evacuated (Unless you are part of the Rear Guard, Died/Stranded Before Rescue) there were remnants of the French Army (cut off by the Germans advance), the Belgian Army, the Netherlands Army, and the Polish Army whose soldiers were also waiting to be evacuated.  But since this a British War Film, they probably only focused on the British perspective.   'Home Came for Them' It is true that British civilians volunteered their yachts, boats, etc to ferry the troops that can only wait on the beach because the heavier transport ships can't come further inland due to tide and weather conditions. Those boats have to bare being strafed or sunk by German aircraft. A certain Titanic Officer also lent his yacht to the Evacuation.   'Where's the Air Force' is bloody funny because it's true there were air battles British vs Germans over Dunkirk, the RAF at that time was still small in pilots and planes that have yet to surpass what the Germans were using at the Evacuation and couldn't provide constant air cover for the boats.   Besides soldiers being left behind, a lot of military equipment was also left behind on the beaches of Dunkirk due to lack of transport which made up a bulk of the British Army had on-hand at that time.",0,0,maidenofthelight,T7O7BtBnsG4,-0.005079365079365095,2017-05-05 19:42:33,True,True

Through the German chain of command led a bias fed choice of weather or not to attack. Adolf Hitler chose not to push into Dunkirk mostly because of the chance of an outbreak, as Rommels line was stretched rather thin. On top of that, Hitlers decision was heavily influenced by German Senior Commander von Runstedt, who wasn't quite fond of Guderian and Rommel for their insubordinate and risk-taking outlooks. This ultimately led to a re-organization order which allowed time for the British to organize the Evacuation of Dunkirk. Hitler rescinded the halt order on the same day as the evacuation had began. As for the French rear-guard, they defended against the actual attack from the German Mechanized armies, and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.",0,0,Dog Shit Burrito,T7O7BtBnsG4,-0.02368421052631579,2017-05-06 01:31:58,True,True

Churchill, as part of the Western war effort, ordered the diversion of food from starving Indians to already well-supplied British soldiers and stockpiles in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, including Greece and Yugoslavia. And he did so with a churlishness that cannot be excused on grounds of policy: Churchill's only response to a telegram from the government in Delhi about people perishing in the famine was to ask why Gandhi hadn't died yet.   ""I hate Indians,"" he told the Secretary of State for India, Leopold Amery. ""They are a beastly people with a beastly religion.""

2017-05-08T07:48:30,"It is a shame this movie will only be perpetuating the myth of Dunkirk. I say myth, because it is clearly an anglocentric tale of British exceptionalism, or at least that is what the trailer shows. To calrify what actually happened at Dunkirk: The French army and the BEF that were fighting in Belgium and northern France were pushed back to a pocket around the town of Dunkirk. There were abouth 300 000 British troops in the pocket and 100 000 French. So already the claim that ""400 000 men couldn't get home"" is false. These men were evacuated because of the resistance of the French army and some British units on other parts of the front, which meant the Germans could not focus their efforts on destroying the pocket of Dunkirk. I see no mention in this trailer of the French army, even though they were essential to the succes of the evacuation. What I see is a blockbuster oozing with British patriotism and false claims of glory, at the expense of those who actually fought the battle of France. The sentence ""we shall never surrender"" is often repeated. It is completely illogical to claim the British would never have surrendered, they had the privilege of being able to retreat accross the channel and did not have to face the german army on land (every time they did, on equal terms, they were soundly defeated). Dunkirk is the glorified retreat of a country that did not commit all its forces to the battle of France, and this retreat was only possible thanks to the sacrifice of the French army. I hope this movie will demonstrate this, but I doubt it.",0,0,bitterlemon13,T7O7BtBnsG4,-0.004310344827586209,2017-05-08 07:48:30,True,True

To finish it off (after they say ""where's the bloody air force""), The spitfires in formation and the rolling of the drums is combined with the machine gun bullets hit the spitfire in the air and the chase is on.

2017-07-22T07:39:27,"Spoiler ahead ! Please don‚Äôt kill me for what I have written below. I am sure I have misunderstood the film that is going to win the Oscars this year.  What a shame. Raving reviews, great trailers, amazing posters and I rushed to the theatres to watch the latest spectacle from Christopher Nolan. Actually his name was enough for me to put #Dunkirk on my desktop. And there it was. A shit of a film that shouldn‚Äôt have even received the status of a feature film. As you must be already aware of the set up, it is based on the miraculous escape of 4,00,000 soldiers stuck and surrounded by German forces during the second world war in the French beach of Dunkirk. Sounds interesting, right? Yah ! I thought so. The film starts at a good pace and a lot of promises. But gradually you will start wondering why the hell the German airforce is only dropping a few bombs where they had the opportunity to ambush them all with a carpet bombing? Understood. May be that‚Äôs what actually happened. But where are the German ships? Who the hell dropped those torpedoes? Where is the airforce? In the entire film you will only see 3 German and the equal amount of British fighter jets flying to gun down each other failing miserably. And you will see it time and again till a point where you might say ‚ÄúDie already‚Äù enough of this shit. And that‚Äôs not all. The British jet that had lesser fuel managed to fly on the sky throughout the film. Gunning down a German aircraft when it didn‚Äôt even have any fuel! It floated like an eagle over the war zone and landed like a breeze in the autumn on the beach (engines off)! Let‚Äôs come to the sea now. The British fleets were capsizing lack a house of cards. As if they were custom made to capsize at the stroke of a single bomb. Come on! A paper boat can take more hits than the ones shown in the film. And there too, you won‚Äôt find a single German ship in the vicinity. Even when the civilian boats were approaching Dunkirk there was no resistance! How are we supposed to know that Hitler actually declared a cease fire for 48 hours during that time? There is no mention in the film. Had it been a low budget regional film I would have understood but this? Is just not acceptable. The story truly had its merits but despite the awesome cinematography and brilliant background score, the movie didn‚Äôt work for me. It didn‚Äôt generate any emotion for anybody that died or survived in the film. This is the director who established time and again that without a super villain you can‚Äôt have a good hero. Be it the nature, the Joker, the black hole or our imagination, he always banked on the adversaries. May be with Dunkirk he wanted to experiment. May be hhe wanted to see what happens if he completely removes the antagonists. Well, shit happens. Shit happened. Dunkirk is an utterly dissatisfying movie that you must watch to prove me wrong. My wife stopped talking to me when I expressed my feelings and I am sure most of you would disagree with me as I heard a lot of people applauding during the credits. But truly I felt cheated at the end of the movie. This is not why we love cinema, this not what we pay for. The film could have been edited to a 40 minutes special docu-feature for Discovery channel but not a feature film. I often wonder why people forget to entertain in films and mind you, we too get entertained when we are emotionally drenched by the directors‚Äô masterstroke but how many of us would have rushed to the theatres on the first day to watch a documentary on Dunkirk with no new information or spectacle offered? I guess all but me. All but the people who worship the master director Christopher Nolan. I am sure it won‚Äôt take long to forget the film. I pray we see the real Nolan soon, very soon.",0,0,priyam biswas,T7O7BtBnsG4,0.14342341160522973,2017-07-22 07:39:27,False,True

I mean, WW2 is a terrible event and people definitely died at Dunkirk, in my opinion, it's not quite fair to watch a war film just because of a star and nothing else.    Plus, there are other good actors like Fionn Whitehead and Mark Rylance, as much as I like Styles, it's not fair that he steal the limelight. The other actors deserve to be recognised for their role.    I do hope that people watching the film just for Styles will actually learn something.

The movie got so boring that we were debating at which point the climax happened.   The only exciting part was the first 5 minutes.  You don't quite care for any of the characters whether they make it alive, there is no emotional connection to any one them.   (Contrast this with Cooper from Interstellar) . To be honest, I'm not even sure why the hell Nolan chose the subject matter of Dunkirk in the first place. A movie about an evacuation can only have that much excitement or plot. It's a weak subject matter for a film. It would have worked better as a documentary.  I cannot comprehend how critics can hail this as his best work ever.

2018-01-07T11:59:23,"OK so I watched this movie for the first time via Google Play and found it interesting but also confusing and frustrating. It felt like it had been poorly scripted and thought out. I like the fact that CGI wasn't used (much) but in reality I think it should have been. What was really strange and misleading was the fact that the production company seemed to fail to get enough extras to populate the beaches. You got the impression that a few hundred troops were being saved instead of 300,000! CGI should have been used to bulk up the numbers and also to remove the modern buildings along the Dunkirk beaches! Back in the 1950s and 60s you could make a WWII movie and know that the buildings would be similar to those in WWII, but today it is essential to use technology to remove obvious modern inaccuracies.  The confusing timeline of events sort of attempted to cover up the fact that the story being told in the movie was extremely weak. The Writer (Nolan) seemed to ignore the bigger picture and we didn't see the German side of events.  One scene in which the boat owner claimed he learnt how to out wit an attacking aircraft from his RAF son just wasn't credible. This was the first time any British pilots had been in a conflict since WWI, his son would have had practically zero experience of attacking boats and the boat owner appeared to have had practical experience of dealing with aircraft attacks (not just theory from discussions with his son).  This film does not come anywhere near the 1958 Dunkirk movie starring John Mills. That movie accurately portrayed the problems of retreat and it was closer to reality, the actors actually spoke. It's sad that many modern directors do not know how to tell a story or really understand people.",1,1,Electric Futures,T7O7BtBnsG4,0.028225806451612902,2018-01-07 11:59:23,False,False

2018-03-05T01:28:34,"What a dull, tedious and laughably unrealistic pile of nonsense! Let me just point out one of many unrealistic scenes: back in 1940, Spitfires cost‚Äé ¬£12,604 (that's ¬£774,905 today). Training a pilot cost a lot too, and both planes and pilots were in desperately short supply, especially at this time. If a pilot had purposefully run out of fuel over the channel in order to try to protect British soldiers from enemy air attack when he knew he could have easily returned to base to refuel, and when he knew his actions would mean having to land in enemy occupied France, he would have been court-martialed when he got home. Personally, knowing the stakes, I would have had him shot for desertion.

2018-03-31T22:21:38,"I watched this film because it was so critically acclaimed... now it's going to get my claim; critically.  But first the acclaimed.  Great wardrobe, the accents and language interaction was realistic and scenery, props, effects and sounds were great but I noticed poor acting from the first 5 minutes of the movie which disappointed me.  The main British young soldier acted like he was a character inside the game ""Call Of Duty"" and showed no true emotion from almost getting killed while all his band of brothers were dying beside him.  They ran straight down the streets instead of looking for cover and getting to safety while bullets were flying down the middle of the street.  When the shooting was over... he looked the same as when he was about to die minutes earlier.  Unrealistic to me.  Then the bombing of the beach...  Why would you not move latterly from a strafing bomb run rather then drop and cover in the open.  I'd be calculating the strafe and moving aside from the bombing... then when they showed the bodies that flew into the air from the shells, none were bloodied except for the one they carried onto the British evacuation ship.  Is this a G rated movie or something that should have realistic perspective?  I expected a Z rating for the most gory, war torn, hell on earth capture of what it was like back then.  Take there!  I had to stop watching just so I could complain about this movie here on this official trailer.  I should direct a movie once to show how it should be done.  I'm going to watch the rest of the movie now but afraid their won't be enough text box characters in this comment section to give my full critical review if I have 2 more hours left of this unrealistic acting movie.",3,1,Dolph C.
