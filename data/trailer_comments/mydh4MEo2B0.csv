2014-01-29T18:41:06,"This story doesn't portray the biblical Heaven. The dead in Christ don't go to Heaven until the second coming of Christ at the time He gathers His people up to Him. 1 Thessalonians 4:5 describes death as sleep just like Jesus described Lazarus when he was dead. (resurrected by Christ after 3 days, now would he have been happy to be yanked out of Heaven to come back into sin?) Verses 14 & 15 talk about the dead in Christ rising from the dead and then after that those left alive will be caught up to Him. We do not go to Heaven in death. We simply die. The saved go to Heaven all together. There is not happiness in Heaven. They don't look down upon us in happiness. God and His angels look down upon us in great sadness due to sin and the denial of God.  And sadly our culture today has really turned to spiritualism which includes apparitions and the idea of an immortal soul that never dies. Saul died because he chose to not follow God and instead consult a which who brought up Samuel. We must remember that the devil was once an angel of God and can preform these types of things if he know we will fall prey and be deceived into believing them. The reason it is bad is because it takes our minds off of God and instead puts it on dead family or other dead people who are sleeping until the return of Christ for His people. We should be focusing on God watching over us not people. Only God see all we do. To put people in that same position is to put them in Gods position and that is having other gods before Him. We must be very careful and pray for the ability to discern what's true or not and by reading the Bible daily and studying Gods word often truth will come. God bless and please don't think this is judging anyone as it's only sharing the truth in this matter. Every Christian is in a different place in their walk with God. Truth comes to those who ask Him for it.  ",0,0,Mandy Stewart,mydh4MEo2B0,-0.019874551971326163,2014-01-29 18:41:06,True,True

You do not go to heaven, or to hell until Jesus Christs returns to Earth to takes His people home. His feet will not touch the Earth. A trumpet will sound, and with a shout the graves shall open, and the dead in Christ will rise first, then we, who remain will be caught up to meet them in the air.

2014-02-02T22:30:24,"Why, oh why, can't anybody see that BOTH sides are wrong in some way when you fight in YouTube comments?  To my fellow Christians: I understand that you feel as though you're being personally attacked. I get it. I really do. But, there is now way in the history of ever that you'll get someone to believe but repeatedly telling that person that God exists and that they need to believe or else 'gets thrown into hellz 5-eva!!!'  No. That doesn't work. At all. Only God can change a person's heart. You have to understand where that other person is coming from and put your feet in their shoes. Stop saying that you're holier-than-thou and listen. Also, please stop assuming that you know that person, their motives, and their heart. You don't. Only God does.  To my fellow man, the Atheists: It seems like now a-days there has been a large rise in hyper atheism. The kind of atheism that doesn't just ignore or politely disagree with deists, but verbally beats them over the head, trying to get them to leave their so-called 'ignorance'.  If someone has been happily believing in God their entire lives what makes you think that a YouTube comment will totally change their mind and sway their hearts to knowledge? Also, deists aren't butt-sniffing monkeys with a lack of intelligence and reason. There are many wise and intelligent deists that are scientists and mathematicians etc.  For everyone: Try not to put yourself upon a pedestal when you talk to someone with different beliefs than your own. Just be kind, respectful, and wise with the words that you say to one another.

It specifically states that God formed the first man's body out of the dust of the ground, and breathed into him the breath of life.

NO ONE is in heaven until the Resurrection.  In the last days there will be GREAT deception, so decieving that it will decieve even the very elect.

When we die our brains that produce our consciousness rots away in the grave, along with the chemicals of dopamine & seratonin that produce the feelings we have of ""joy"" & so on, it's a strange idea that we'd somehow be in heaven without brains to experience it with, or the ""joy"" of it :P   & Also, why would a randomly evolved ape species known as homo sapien get a heaven & no other animal species? & Why would stone-age peasants whose other religious ideas included justifying stoning, genocide, slavery & ownership of people be right about the most extraordinary claim of an afterlife when they're clearly not a credible source for anything else.  But furthermore! Since there's no heaven nor hell, what becomes of religious ""morality""? Without the punishment of hell or  the ""reward"" of heaven it sort of crumbles in on itself. So instead of admitting to any of these known & easily observable facts  to accept reality & harness science to make our world into a better place, people in the absence of any imagination of the possibilities would rather condemn the world, reject reality & cynically believe in serving a nonexistent god in their only time in life all for their own selfishness & fear.  Worst of all is the fact that when you die, you won't ever again get a chance to even know the severity of that mistake because you will never again exist in this universe, we know this because we ARE the bodies that we inhabit, when it dies, we die, the end. ",12,6,Space Age Shakespeare,mydh4MEo2B0,0.16423395445134573,2014-07-06 00:02:14,False,True

""I am not an Atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe.  We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly.

You can completely change someone's mind on evolution, the beginning of the universe, anything at all IF you provide the proper evidence and facts to back it up. It's different from religious ""faith"" because religious faith IS unshakeable, or at least is supposed to be. That's why so many people still believe the Bible word-for-word after hundreds of years, even though a lot of evidence and facts contradict the book. That's what I've been trying to tell you this whole time. Science is not religion. They're not even remotely similar. They can work with or against each other, but they are not the same thing.  By the way, I'm not the one who started up the conversation again. I only replied because I got a notification about someone else posting, and it made me notice that my reply to you had been ""mysteriously"" deleted.

In 1976 I surrendered my life to Jesus Christ.  The Next day, I had the most accelerating experience of my life...From there on I knew I had a New life starting all over again.. this time in Christ; as a born again Christian.  Many years later, as it was my whole hearts desire to meet, and see the Lord Jesus Christ... that in 1997. I was taken up into heaven with an older lady.  Wow! what an experience. ""Message for the sceptics:""   If you fail to accept the forgiveness of Christ that he died for you, then I can tell you truly, Heaven will not become your home - from this life at all.  Hell awaits those that refuse to repent in not accepting the love of Christ.  The precious free gift of life eternal. Jesus says: I am the way, the truth, and the life, no one can go to the Father, accept by me. New testament.   Accept Jesus Today! Right Now!! Eternal life is a Free gift of God.

The problem isn't hate or jealousy, it's how immoral things in the bible control our society, like hating the LGBT community, where families shun their sons and daughters for being gay. Or (which is sort of outdated in America) when women couldn't get a divorce, or even when women were just properties to their husbands in the ""eyes of God"". So many more examples exist in the Bible that people worship everyday, but the truth is that many many many centuries ago a bunch of homophobic, racist, etc men came together and wrote these ""rules"" themselves, which eventually made up the bible and created hope for a population that wanted answers. Psychologically, at that time, there was barely any scientific practice and it just seemed fairly sane to follow your parents' religion growing up as a child when you looked up to them. There was nothing wrong with that... but today revolves around the scientific method, so without proof, why should we revolve our lives around rules which further separate our society based on the immoral beliefs of centuries ago?",0,0,Julie Shriver,mydh4MEo2B0,0.11041666666666666,2017-08-04 01:55:43,False,False
