If he were to wake up in a world without anybody remembering The Beatles that would drastically change everything in history from previous wars and political and civil rights movements, bands influenced by The Beatles ( i.e. Coldplay). The point being is that he wouldn't wake up in the same world but with zero Beatles, he'd have to wake up in an entirely different world. The Beatles didn't just influence the landscape of music, but they influenced  e v e r y t h i n g.  There' also the matter of context. 2019 is a much different time than when the Beatles first gained major popularity in America. Even in the world they are trying to create,  The Beatles music wouldn't gain the same popularity now that it did back then. Rap music dominates the charts more than pop music, or rock music nowadays and people wouldn't catch on like they did back then. I'm not saying that The Beatles music isn't timeless, because it is. They remain to this day my absolute favorite band of all time. However for their music to have caught on and influenced the world the way it did, it had to have been made in the 60s.   This movie plays with a concept that is no more fleshed out than the initial idea. It feels immature, like a couple of elementary school kids thought of it. You don't have to be a lifelong Beatles fan to recognize that a world without (or any chart dominating 60s artist) would be a completely different world.

Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers.

Anyway, instead of an idiot waking up and discovering that only he remembers The Beatles, I would've much rather wanted to see a film about a man who wakes up or time travels to the 60s, just before The Beatles become famous. And instead of being the only one who knows the songs, he knows them BEFORE The Beatles do! So he keeps on recording and releasing their songs as they WRITE them! Much hilarity ensues as The Beatles can't figure out how the hell he manages to steal their songs, and what first starts out as a light comedy, soon turns into a paranoid thriller as The Beatles start suspecting that they have a spy in their midst...",0,2,teppolundgren,H3VeHyedL1U,0.10575757575757576,2019-03-09 04:23:13,True,True

2019-07-17T06:18:37,"I finally saw Yesterday today.  And read many of the review articles...first, I like early Beatles songs and saw them on Ed Sullivan show when I was five.  That said...I really enjoyed the movie and yes, it could have been better. BUT...there is a bigger idea of time and space at play here.  What if...in your life the biggest influence that championed your soul didn't exist?  For character Jack, he took a bite from the poisoned apple. I understand that for Danny Boyle to sign on as director, he changed about 25% of the original screenplay and some scenes seen in the trailer are not in the film. The character of JACK needed the words and music of the Beatles to find and recognize the love he had been denying himself...even so, in doing so, he knew he was a fraud.  The most dull casting choice was Ed Sheeran. Not sure Chris Martin of Coldplay would have been a good choice, either, but he was the original first choice.  JACK googles ""the Beatles"" but not them individually; even so, he meets two people who also ""remember"" and celebrate the moment by passing along something precious...the location where there is a quasi-organic meeting with a man who may or may not be John Lennon, the man, but not the songwriter.  Enough said. Articles have mentioned the movie to border on the surreal Twilight Zone. (I loved Outer Limits, too.) Time travel stories such as this get a little prickly in continuity when you look too deep; there is always a flaw if the continuity isnt meticulous; too many roads untraveled in this one. I did like the movie, and it was entertaining. Hearing fresh renditions of Beatles classics were welcome. It is a love story after all and in the end, love is all you need.  P.S. So many young people have no idea who the Beatles are and wouldn't know a Beatles song if they heard one...for a movie story, it was a good premise to start with...I wonder if it will be nominated for an AARP Movies for Grownups award.",0,0,Sabrina N,H3VeHyedL1U,0.2973611111111111,2019-07-17 06:18:37,False,True
