2019-10-29T17:34:25,"I actually think this will be better than the previous iterations. The previous Americanized remake tried too hard to pay homage to the original without actually doing anything original itself. You don't do an American remake of a Japanese horror film and keep the locale and setting in Japan. Here's how it works. The Japanese originals create the overall plot and originality of the storyline; the Japanese are usually best at this (for supernatural ghost stories). The American studios then pay the original storywriters some hefty royalties (out of both respect and legal obligations) and do what the American studios do better - make the monsters, ghosts, and overall setting scarier or more cinematic (depending on the needs of the storyline). They usually have the creative freedom to move the storyline's central locale - something they failed to do in the first Americanized remake of Ju-On. One glance at this and I can already see this is light years ahead of the original American remake in the special effects department, and the original American remake was already light years ahead of Ju-On in that area. But this time they also look like they finally moved the setting to something more suited to American audiences (it looks like Washington, Minnesota, or maybe even Canada). Horror films pretty much all still suffer from the same problems - weak plot points in which the screenwriters overly rely on the stupidity of the characters in their story. That aspect won't change here. But it does appear to be something that will actually be an improvement over the original Americanized remake.",0,0,Uriah Light,O2NKzO-fxwQ,0.124973544973545,2019-10-29 17:34:25,True,True

You have to move on while paying tribute to it, and nod to the audience while paving a new way, which is what Nicolas has done with this film.‚Äù       For many, it may feel like only yesterday that the Japanese horror craze had a foothold in the business of frightening audiences with raven-haired evil forces. Shockingly though, we are closing in on 20 years since the heyday of the original Japanese films and subsequent American remakes of¬†The Ring¬†and¬†The Grudge. Now¬†Sam Raimi¬†(of¬†The Evil Deadand classic¬†Spider-Man¬†movies) is back again with his Ghost House Pictures production company to produce an all-new¬†The Grudge¬†that will kick 2020 off in style. With Director Nicolas Pesce (The Eyes of My Mother, Piercing) and stars Andrea Risebourough, Lin Shaye, and¬†GLOW's Betty Gilpin¬†by his side, Raimi bought the first   The first big takeaway is that we shouldn't be mistaken, this new film is not necessarily a reboot and it isn‚Äôt necessarily a sequel. Instead it is another tale from the same universe as the Japanese films, as well as the American ones. ‚ÄúThe Grudge¬†is an anthology series,‚Äù Pesce explains. ‚ÄúThe movies are [about] different characters, different stories, different locations, different ghosts. Aside from the second and third American remakes, it‚Äôs all been very contained to Japan.‚Äù  While the characters from the original American remake were primarily foreigners living in and around Tokyo, this new version will take place wholly in the U.S. Pesce says, ‚ÄúThe Grudge is like a virus; it‚Äôs super-contagious. So the fact that it would stay in the tiny city of Tokyo is unrealistic. It exists in Asia, Europe, Africa, in America, because it has spread. I know a lot of people think this is a remake of a remake, which is isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ this movie exists in the same world as the Japense movie, we‚Äôre just adding a chapter.‚Äù",0,0,Daniel,O2NKzO-fxwQ,-0.02248106060606061,2019-10-30 01:15:20,True,True

2019-12-29T23:19:56,The new movie looks like a gory jumpscare fest. Not what made the originals scary. The originals were scary becasue of the subtlety and realism. No colorful camera or over use of cgi. This may have been becasue of the budget  but it worked very well. It was also scary becasue of the noise. Very common noise. The colors two. It's easy to mistake things for the grudge becasue of the black and white. Just the feeling of impending inescapable doom. Hope they dont make it a glorified adventure movie. It better keep making normal things scary like the shower. The shower is scary becasue u cant hear or see outside. That is why phsyco was so scary. A real horror movies is not only scary during the movie but after. Also the grudge 2 was terrible for trying to quantify and explain the curse. Made it less scary. Also I hope they dont give more stupid hoody scenes. Also gore isnt scary. Disturbing imigary like stuff that looks like the grudge being everywhere and weird eye stuff like in Ringu is scary. Also weird gross stuff like mouth foaming and saliva is. More realistic that pointless gore and cg.
