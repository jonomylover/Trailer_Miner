2015-08-10T01:00:40,"This movie has ""guilty pleasure"" vibe for me.  AND THAT IS NOT A BAD THING.  Remember that a good movie and an entertaining movie are not always the same thing. A movie doesn't always have to be a 5 star experience.  Sometimes, you just want a Big Mac, and not a 5 star fancy dinner.  I do enjoy movies that I can shut off my brain, suspend my disbelief, and just have fun.  Van Helsing, I Frankenstein, the Resident Evil series, Street Fighter (Van Dame), the Blade trilogy, and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen are all bad movies....but entertaining and fun.  This movie looks pretty badass and entertaining.  It also looks cheesy and hokey.  Above all else...it looks like it will be fun!  Vin Diesel is in a select group of actors who have an immunity to bad dialogue.  Actors who can say the corniest, cheesiest, and awful dialogue...and sill make it look and sound cool.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Keanue Reeves are also in that club.  So Vin Diesel is in an elite class in my opinion.  This one I am excited for!",0,0,Nicholas Gordon,QMJauze_cl8,0.038628472222222224,2015-08-10 01:00:40,True,True

Jesus frees us from false religions and self righteousness and evil witchcraft, and yes all magic and all there religions are wicked and evil. yes I believe the Bible, and I believe every word. I believe God sent Jesus to save us from His Wrath and therefore we no longer have stonings, because as displayed with the adulterous woman in john 8 God as Jesus showed compassion to the adulterous woman. He would no doubt show a witch compassion, but He would tell him or her the truth about their demonic forces they are messing with and what they worship is shifty and shadowy and very evil. even if it is harry potter magic, or wicca or somethinbg wicked like that. but Jesus did say that you cannot have God and the world (sinful selfish ways and wicked magic and stuff) and it is shown in the new testament that friendship with the world is at enmity with God. Jesus is Lord over all, even if you do not believe. there is forgiveness for sins and freedom from sin, and condmenation only in Jesus, and Jesus Saves from God's Wrath, all have sinned and no one is righteous before God. there is no such thing as a good person, only God is good. romans 1-6. but if you are found in sin or unrepentant or unremorseful about seeking your own desires and anything but God, the judgment will find you guilty, and very worthy of hell fire and an eternitg of death. become saved now, don't wait another moment. hebrews 9:27, after death is the judgement, and if you are found without Christ Jesus, or in lukewarmity or apostasy, it will be found you were never saved. john 3:16. for God so loved the world that He gave His Only Son that whoever should believe in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. no one can enter heaven unless they are born again and saved by Jesus from sin and made reconciled before God. romans 5.",0,0,Charlie Mae Brown,QMJauze_cl8,-0.006885822510822545,2015-11-06 06:21:24,False,True

Then you see other films like my personal example of  horror movies like ''It follows'' with very high ratings when theyre actually crappy and good ones like ''Mama'' or ''Pandorum'' with sequels that never happened.
