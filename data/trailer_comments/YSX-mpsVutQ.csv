Talking about positives first i must say it is well directed and acted, beautifully shot and quite interesting for the most time. It raised some heavy questions and i like that aspect. Unfortunately it is jumbled and unevenly paced that it feels rushed in the beggining and drawn out in the middle.Characters were not developed that well and you do not feel so much for them and their pain plus combining their dumb decisions with melodrama that bites so hard during the film, it gets quite underwhelming. There are also unanswered questions in the end and kinda cheesy sendoff but if you are rom drama junkie and you need your fix then you could go far worse than this. 3/5",0,0,ogorjefan,YSX-mpsVutQ,-0.02592592592592594,2016-12-29 15:55:21,False,False
