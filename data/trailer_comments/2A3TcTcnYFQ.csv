2017-03-06T05:02:22,As a black man I have to say this is the most disgusting thing I've seen in my life. It is sad that these three women would degrade themselves my making a movie like this. 40 to 50 year old women with a teenage mentality. This this why nobody wants to date black women. whoever watches this trailer or movie needs to understand that not all black people act like this.
