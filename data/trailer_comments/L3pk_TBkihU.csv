I appreciate him tremendously and I really enjoyed a couple of his flicks (like some of his Batman flick and Inception specifically). I haven't seen everything but his more recent stuff I've seen from him like Interstellar and Dunkirk have been mediocre at best. I hate to say this but his writing and dialogue is not for me. This one, based on the trailer alone, has got me generally excited. It definitely looks and feels like a Nolan flick but something about this has intrigued me more than his other flicks. Maybe it's just some of the eccentric performances that are currently being showcased here like Washington, Pattinson and Branagh or the fascinating way the flick seems to be executing it's premise that's creative and action-packed but with a generally smart mind to it that doesn't come across as pretentious (ala Inception).",0,0,DieHardAlien,L3pk_TBkihU,0.17044817927170872,2020-05-22 01:04:36,True,True

If it's on inception's level of greatness (which it looks to be better) it's going to have a nice long run in theatres. With multiple views great word of mouth. Christopher Nolan invites us all back to the Cinema for a film that was made for us to marvel discuss online, prepare us for more future Nolan and most notably welcome us back to the movies. Nolan is my biggest role model in regards to his strong support of going to the movies to see any including his own work and also through his filmography the messages imbedded in the plots have been more than inspiring towards me in relation towards my well being. Warner Bros will always be my favorite movie studio as they are often responsible for creating deep cutting original films while having a gallery of exclusive directors who all rank amongst my all time favorites. Not to mention my top three all time favorite films just so happen to be Warner Bros releases. 1.Inception 2.interstellar 3 the original matrix 1999 üëçüòÄ. Who knows maybe have to shuffle one of these films down a notch after going to theatres either in July or August and seeing this master piece that played a special theatres only trailer 10 months ago that caught me and everyone in the audience off guard soon to follow were 2 sets of applause after seeing from Christopher Nolan and the eventual reveal of the title.

Worked so well for inception. I feel the visuals are super mediocre almost like what we see in HBO television standards.   I am super excited about the story but super bummed about visuals.

I'm not sure if I'm making u understand but the thing is like in simple words is that ... movie is going to start from the scene of world war 3 with a lot of destroyed city but people are living simply (they r supposed to be dead but they don't) the people are going to die in end as the scene of assembly hall shows and people r like they are in sleep(or dead) but they r going to be saved if they(heroes) stop that little disturbance(i.e butterfly effect like in steins gate) then everything will be ok and restored...  finally it's like the heroes have to save the future so they are not going to the past from future to change things but to go in future from past to change things ...

2020-05-22T11:12:03,"Inversion might simply mean moving a person from one timeline to other timeline. Watch Steins gate for better understanding of my comment. Or,if u have no time, then u can google John Titor and find some data about him.  Explanation about timelines and link with parallel universe: In short, there are multiple timelines in this universe ( not like 100 or 1000 or 10000 timelines) but, for smallest unit of time , i.e. less than millisecpnd, or like nanoseconds. For each nanosecond , there is a timeline fixated. This timeline works just in parallel with other infinite number of timelines.   What Tenet's Inversion might actually be? In other movies, Time travel is simply shown as Past present and future. But this Inversion thing, really thrills me up . It might be that the user or time traveller can simply jump from one timeline to another timeline. He in the timeline, where he is originally from, will have noone of the user's existence ( Google for better understanding).  Limitation of This Timeline jumps: Butterfly effect. Small changes in one timeline may pile up to make a big change in the timeline and hence, causing distortions or errors in the original timeline",0,0,Suyan Shrestha,L3pk_TBkihU,0.028373015873015876,2020-05-22 11:12:03,True,True

For example, when Robert asks, ""What the hell happened here?"" and John replies, ""It hasn't happened yet."" It's because the bullet holes exist w/o the gun being shot at the glass. So when you see him fighting that soldier, the soldier isn't shooting bullets at John. The bullets are bouncing off the window back into the bullet chamber. Same thing when he shoots the bullet at the rock. Those bullets have already been shot at the rock. So when he pulls the trigger, the bullets are going off the rock back into the bullet chamber. He's ""catching the bullet."" Time travel is going back to when events haven't happened. Time inversion is when events have happened but the cause comes after. So usually it's cause and effect. Inversion is effect then cause. And events around the characters are happening backwards while everything else continues to move foward. In time travel, everything is moved backwards.",147,21,Spider Man,L3pk_TBkihU,0.05833333333333333,2020-05-23 21:54:21,True,True

If you want to find out why God allows evil go to Genesis.  God intended this earth to be perfect in all ways.   However God has a rule that he always follows. Its called ( freedom of choice. )   Every precious life he creates he gives them freedom to choose. Because he doesn't force anyone to love him. Its his wisdom.   God gave Adam and Eve 2 options  - Ignore that tree and live in my love and peace.  OR - eat from that cursed tree and you will be like God and you will know what evil is. Then death will be part of life.   Eve chose that 2nd option. Thats why we live in a cursed world, where Satan decieves as many as he can.   However there is good news for you and me.   JESUS CHRIST. He came to bring you back to himself. He shed his blood for people who realize they need forgiveness. These people will be saved from hell and will inherit Gods kingdom.   God gave us a promise that one day Jesus will come back to rule and all Evil will stop. Bad people will be judged and will go to Hell and followers of Christ who were forgiven will be rewarded.  God has a plan. The question is are you on his side?   All it takes is to open your heart and call on him. ;)  God wants to be personally FOR YOU He desires relationship with you.

These agents do not participate in our time space laws but can inverse  time to try to adjust the narrative to an alternative reality. They act on a sort of isthmus between two outcomes. This capability is caused by some sort of psychopharmacological agent that leads one to forfeit our axioms of reality. The Afterlife is an intelligence ancillary sector that delves into some sort of  paraops (paradimensional operations)  it may even tackle Psychonautics and Psychological Operations.

With the plot going forward as normal as it seems, what will short our brains and fry its insides is that of the time reversal concept of that of the protagonist... this two way conflict will be awesome and with social distancing as a new norm this movie would be thoroughly enjoyed as there won't be people sitting immediate next ...   So it's basically gonna be a movie where actions which have had consequences or would have consequences in the near future, things need to be set right by reversing the actions, scene after scene or to avoid those events which haven't happened yet...

2020-05-24T21:11:45,"""Time Travel?   No...well sort of a big Yes"". Oh optional endings. And this tamely-collared character can reverse the technically present-day/time outcome: choice. However the more possible outcome can obviously still be prevented/cockblocked by his enemies or sims. Why only him though? A government experient?  Dr.Strange is amused.   So how do the 'knowns'= the present-day (the doctor lady) acknowledge this phenomenon without freaking out, knowing there might be other X-Men out there?! How can he reverse his actions without effecting all of space itself= effecting lives as well. *WE DID SEE the doctor move in the room, look again where she is standing when he shoots & when it ends= BRILLIANT! Or they could playing around with editting haha! 2ND obervation: He might also have the ability to mind-control,  focus-in on them like a section of space, somewhat like Professor Wheels ;) or just being holding 'THEE special paper clip'. Conclusion:  this is like a modern day 'Minority Report' with a - more collared-semiGovernment-based conspiracies & minus the precog visions, it's only what he witnesses in the present to therefore change his  (reversed) now future or not. I'd like to see Behind the Scenes when Nolan gives the explaination/ theme of the film  'inversion'  to the cast & they all give him blank stares or reply ""great I'll just say specificity again""., seriously pretty interesting stuff. I will watch it. Good job all around!

2020-05-30T14:55:04,"I noticed a pattern in the release of his movies. They're grouped into trilogies, though only one is official. The grounded trilogy: Memento Insomnia Prestige  The superhero trilogy: Batman Begins The Dark Knight The Dark Knight Rises  The science fiction trilogy: Inception Interstellar Tenet  Dunkirk is the start of the most recent one. We shall see. Anyway, stay with me.  So, Nolan makes two movies of a trilogy, and then makes the first movie of the next one just to announce what is next before finally making the third movie and concluding the trilogy. Then he proceeds to do the same with the new trilogy and so on. He made Memento and Insomnia, both  grounded films filled with mystery. Then he started his superhero trilogy with Batman Begins before releasing Prestige that is also a grounded movie filled with mystery. Then he proceeded to continue his superhero trilogy with The Dark Knight. Then he made Inception, the first movie of his blockbuster sci-fi trilogy. Then he could conclude his superhero trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises. He proceeded with his sci-fi trilogy by releasing Interstellar. Then he started the fourth trilogy with Dunkirk, which promises to be an action packed visual marvel with minimal dialogue. Now when he's started that, he has come back to his sci-fi trilogy to wrap it up with Tenet. I also noticed that he always makes the first and third movie very similar to give us a sense of closure.  Memento and Prestige are both non-linear and confusing, unlike a more clear Insomnia. Batman Begins and TDKR both feature The League of Shadows and high stakes action, unlike the more philosophical TDK. Now, I notice that Inception and Tenet could actually be related and are similar from the looks of it.

For example, a star may have disappeared years ago, but it will take years for light to travel until we can feel its disappearance. Assuming that the sun ceases to shine, this event will have no effect on earth at this moment, and we can only be affected by this event in the absolute past five minutes later, when earth is within the future light cone of the event. The movie may use this logic, an event will generate a future light cone, the event is approaching us at the speed of light, its physical effects are completely unpredictable before arrival, because we do not find the event happening, we are still outside the future light cone of the event. The protagonist himself may have some ability, or borrow some ability, to perceive and enter the future light cone, to make some kind of change before events affect the present.",1,0,VANÈ´ò,L3pk_TBkihU,0.1534722222222222,2020-06-01 03:44:02,True,True
