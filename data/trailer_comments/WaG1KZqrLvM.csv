Jason from the Friday the 13th films always comes back, and kills almost all the teens. He's essentially the main character since no one likes the teens. And that franchise was super successful.  So instead of highly advanced aliens who dedicate their lives to literally hunting aliens getting killed by any human... (danny glover.. im looking at you) make a recurring badass Predator who is tenacious as any hero. And find extremely creative ways for him to win.

Oh right, you breed an Unstable Extra-Large Slab of Ugly, shove a nuke up its butt, and infect it with every possible exo-disease you can scrounge, on the hunch that if the radiation release doesn't do it, the spread of randomly mutated diseases not native to planet just might.

2018-06-27T03:31:35,"Dear friends, Jesus Christ loves you so much! He is also always working on your behalf. Bring Jesus Christ, through the Holy Spirit, all of your concerns, including your dreams. Talk with Him about EVERYTHING, letting the Light of His Presence shine on your hopes and plans. Spend time allowing His Light to infuse your dreams with life, gradually transforming them into reality. This is a very practical way of collaborating with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.   Father God, the Creator of the universe, have deigned to co-create with you. Do not try to hurry this process. If you want to work with Him, you have to accept His time frame.   Hurry is not in Our Creator's nature. Abraham and Sarah had to wait many years for their fulfillment of God's promise, which was a son. How their long wait intensified their enjoyment of this child! Remember dear ones, Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses. Have faith in the ultimate truth that Jesus Christ is The Way, The Truth, and The Life. Give your whole being to him right now. You will never regret making this greatest decision in your life. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  (Psalm 36 :9; Genesis 21 : 1-7; Hebrews 11 : 1) (AMP)",4,2,msdogooder,WaG1KZqrLvM,0.3066558441558441,2018-06-27 03:31:35,True,True

Flex tape is no ordinary tape; its triple thick adhesive virtually welds itself to the surface, instantly stopping the toughest leaks. Leaky pipes can cause major damage, but Flex Tape grips on tight and bonds instantly! Plus, Flex Tape‚Äôs powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater! Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas in water without draining them! Flex Tape is perfect for marine, campers and RVs! Flex Tape is super strong, and once it's on, it holds on tight! And for emergency auto repair, Flex Tape keeps its grip, even in the toughest conditions! Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holes. To show the power of Flex Tape, I sawed this boat in half! And repaired it with only Flex Tape! Not only does Flex Tape‚Äôs powerful adhesive hold the boat together, but it creates a super strong water tight seal, so the inside is completly dry! Yee-doggy! Just cut, peel, stick and seal!

A good person to sympathize with and care about. 7) It must be suspenseful, intelligent, intense, and creative. 8) No standard predictable 'Hollywood ending'. 9) It must be scientifically feasible within the sci-fi parameters already established. 10) It must have a diversity of pacing - some slow parts, character development, interspersed with action parts.

2018-07-06T13:21:31,"WoW, another movie inspired by nerdy  comics with a Paul WS Anderson vibe ( beware the shuriken ). Predator was clearly an horrific primal creature with low intelligence (got trapped by boyscout tricks) and using such space hunting tech does not mean he is even able to craft it. In the first movie the creature is defined ""sporty"" by Dutch but it is clearly SARCASM...the woman was not the primary target in that moment because she was not armed, but she would have been just killed after Dutch. Predator has not honor at all...he has overconfidence on advanced tech to hunt stealthy and have fun on killing  peoples. Comics started all the nerdy things and we got ""fancy chromed space samurais with honor code"" willing to team up with humans or even accepting them in a ""Yautja-KAI Dojo"". Xenomorph received a similar treatment because in  Cameron movie was wiped and even defined by soldiers as a ""space bug"" but we all know how HARD the xeno body is...and marines are said to use special bullets to penetrate it...but NERD comic writers overplotted on few movie lines and we got the ""Antlike space xeno with many colours\queens\shapes etc"". A talented director like John Carpenter,Veroheven, Scott, Dante, Kubric would never accept to make an AVP movie or transform an horror movie in a silly comic action-comedy just to sell to a broad audience...but the nowadays casual dumb mass will even probably pay to watch a JAWS reboot with an upgraded superpowered shark in 4k...wtf i want 80's back",0,0,Danny Permanenti,WaG1KZqrLvM,0.04848985890652556,2018-07-06 13:21:31,True,True

Hope hope both humans and predators do some really cool new stuff.  Also I hope there is a part where the humans are able to reach the first generation prators and they work together to fight the xenomorph ultimate predator. The ultimate should camouflage without alien technology and be completely invisible standing still. Human scientists should have studied predator flesh tissue and developed some king of hi tech anti predator hi velocity round that can kill first generation predators and the ultimate can be killed by these rounds with only a shot though the heart (not possible with body armour) and straight through the mouth.

Predator 2 was the movie that introduced the taunting and arrogant nature of them. I understand that they kill to test themselves and making the enemy angry probably makes things more interesting but i always saw the Predator as an ""honorable"" creature.

Autism spectrum disorder is not human evolutionary biology it is ecological poisoning that occurs due to excitotoxicity beyond the blood brain barrier and glyphosate protein recombinant dysfunction (aka medical poisoning combined with a dietary poison).  3.)

The CGI looks worse than it did in AVP, which is shocking.  They made fun of mental disorders throughout the ENTIRE movie. A few jokes of that sort are fine, and don't bother me, but they did it the ENTIRE film.  They tried too hard to be like the original, as well. Butchered lines from the original, tried to re-crate the ""rag tag"" band of soldiers, but horribly failed. I'd say the worst offender in this movie, by far, is how awful the effects were. I seriously don't think they were finished with them, but had to release the film. The blood has a weird 3D CGI look to it, both the human, and predator blood. The ships looked pretty bad, and the predators themselves looked pretty bad with their masks off.  Do NOT waste your time or money with this film.

Saw a few clips posted on YouTube, which impressed me, as you have finally... *FINALLY* included the Yautja dialogue. Quite frankly, if there's to be another Predator film, I would rather see the Predators themselves as central characters and jump more into their culture with much more dialogue between them, studying the humans etc.  The Predator franchise has come such a long way since the first film. The Predator isn't just a background villain anymore. In the wake of dozens and dozens of comic books, novels, games, maybe it's time to do a film, or even a short TV series of a few episodes, that focuses mostly and solely on the Predators themselves: hunts, traditions, honour, dishonour, clans, bloodlines... I'm sure a majority of Predator fans would be interested in possibly seeing this as opposed to the usual formula, which has been present in 3 of the 4 movies, as I've not seen this 4th instalment yet.",0,0,Dreamzkape,WaG1KZqrLvM,0.1738095238095238,2018-09-28 21:36:39,False,True

While Arnold and his family haven't heard of it he begins hearing reports of a ""terrorist"" attack and is concerned like everyone else is. Then throughout the next few days there are multiple attacks near his location and as he reads the reports and autopsy reports he learns that multiple people were skinned and strung up from their legs and that's when it gets to the setting of the movie as he fears what happened in the jungle is happening again; But with that knowledge and him being older, he knows what to do and needs help to stop whatever is happening.
