I was wrong. It's like they just take concepts from every star wars movie, put it in a blender and serve it up and call it a star wars movie. There's no destination that it's going to. Before Disney's acquisition of Star Wars, the single moment that the movies built up to was the redemption of Anakin Skywalker. That was it. Now, it's all just one big star wars smoothie and I don't have any desire to continue watching the franchise. I'm done. It's heartbreaking to even say that, but Disney ripped my childhood out with the force awakens and stomped on it with the last Jedi.

Michael Giacchino even did a decent job of taking William's formula, and putting his own spin on it for Rogue one. It wasn't great, but it also didn't distract and make it obvious...but this just feels too much on the side of Blade Runner, Tron, or Trent Reznor's soundtrack for The Social Network, which are all fantastic soundtracks, but that's because it fits the film properly.

2018-02-05T16:21:56,"Dear Star Wars Fanbase (SPOILERS FOR THE NEW FILMS),  In 1977, the world was blown away by a new movie called ""Star Wars."" When the sequel came out a few years later, people hated it because it went a new route the people at first didn't like. However, the movie later on to become seen as a great film and eventually the best of the entire series. Return of the Jedi releases a few years later, it also was received well, although you guys were divided over Ewoks.   Cut to 1999, The Phantom Menace is released, after such loads of hype, you guys hated the film and the later two because of the quality. Honestly, I don't blame you. When I was a kid, they were my favorite of the series, but as an adult, I know they aren't good movies. Here's the thing: they could've been much worse. The prequels did have some upsides, such as the combat, some of the casting, and the potential story.  Cut to 2015, The Force Awakens is released (the first film without Lucas involved), you guys are divided over the film because of various reasons. The biggest one is the film was an exact copy of Episode IV. No it was not. It had similar story elements, but it was not an exact copy. The film wouldn't have furthered the franchise if it were the case. Cut to 2017, The Last Jedi is released. You guys are even more divided because of the risks it took as a Star Wars movie. In fact, you are so divided you attack other people who disagree with you.   One question: Why? Just why? Why do you have to behave so rabidly over a Sci-Fi Fantasy series? Criticizing filmmaking decisions is one thing, but ranting over things that didn't please you, like the lack of deep lore, or fan theories not coming true, or just not getting what you guys exactly wanted is not fair. I LOVED The Last Jedi, I didn't think it was perfect (no movie is, not even the original trilogy), but I still was captivated and moved by the film. Star Wars is a super fun movie franchise, and hating on the new movies just because Snoke died or a not-that-badly executed Casino scene is just plain dumb. Give the new movies a chance. The series is NOT ruined not one bit. You guys have said that when Empire came out, when the prequels came out, and when the new films came out, when that was never EVER the case. It's just taking new directions and that's okay. If it didn't Star Wars would have actually died. So please, all I'm asking of you is just give a fair opinion on the films based on what they are, and not your own desires. Disney has not ruined Star Wars and I don't believe they will, because unlike the prequels, their films take Star Wars to a new direction the RIGHT way. Be more open and be more fair. Please.

Especially with the last Jedi and it’s unnecessary amount of dialogue and plot holes throughout the movies they aren’t doing this for true Star Wars fans they are simply making excuses of films and branding them Star Wars so they will sell.

However, as I am myself a skeptic and critic of a number of directions that Disney has taken with Star Wars I too am wary of this film in hopes that I will be pleasantly surprised and I do think that is both a valid and common feeling for many out there even if they are misunderstood. Critics aren't bad people for having an opinion and those who like Disney's direction aren't either.

I don't know how anyone can see it as different or fresh. Everything they've done is boring, predictable and safe.  I really did have high hopes that Disney would do something new and interesting with the franchise, but it's obviously just a cashcow to them, being fueled with nostalgia to keep people hooked. Oh, I'm sure there will be as much fan service show horned into this movie as possible. Jabba, Boba Fett, Greedo, some background droids, the kessel run, blah, blah, blah.

Not saying he's not a good actor, or that it won't be a good film.  There's just no replacing Harrison Ford, in my book, and that's going to be a barrier for me going in to this film.

Why is it that people mind seeing people of color on screen? Is it because you're disgusted by people who are not white? Is it because you're too used to seeing white people in most of your movies that when some movies deviate from that formula, your entire world view collapses?   You do understand that the heroes Hollywood put up on the screen have a massive effect on the self-perception of a lot of people of color, right?   I've watched movies since 1990 (that I am aware of) and I would be hardpressed to find ANY brown coloured hero in a Hollywood movie. My heroes were always white, a few black and even few Asian. So for a guy like me who has and STILL HAS hundreds of white colored heroes, mostly men, it's REFRESHING that Hollywood is now opening up the goodiebag and offering more heroes and more belief in the inner qualities of people despite their skin colour or gender.   I extremely rarely find people who are not white that have this problem and I hate to be the one to generalise... but it seems to be a white male problem. Black, brown, yellow... we've all had and still have tons of heroes that look like you. Why does it hurt you so much to have heroes that look like me?

However, I am struggling with seeing these characters from the Original trilogy, outside of its specific whimsical atmosphere, without pondering good and evil, without family conflict rooted in that morality. It's as though they inhabit a different franchise now.   A great deal of this may be the aesthetic changes also, there is a lot of CGI and crisp interiors in this trailer. However I think my own issue is the former. Star Wars was mythology; a father and son conflict over morality, using fantasy archetypes, with a space opera levity and aesthetic.  It hasn't been that since the originals which is fine, it's a hard thing to franchise out (regarding narrative not merchandise) which is why everything that isn't the originals is different (the exception being the Force Awakens which is similar). The Prequels are an attempt at tragedy, Rogue One is an average war film, and The Last Jedi changed the rules specifically to get away from the constrictive mythology formula of the Originals - one of the major complaints from people was that Luke wasn't the same character, the tone and his actions were wrong.

The duo of Phil Lord and Chris Miller have good comedic sensibilities. I'm worried that the studio execs thought that they were too bold and that they wanted to make the film more marketable by getting rid of their creative stamp. The notion that this film could have become a parody under their reign isn't ideal either. But again compromise.

2018-02-06T05:23:05,I'm a 12 year old fan from Australia and I LOVE star wars! I can't wait to see this new film and learn about the character Hand Solo! I loved Rey in the last film and she was great! My only complaint was that old guy that teaches her. He was kind of boring and Rey is so strong I dont think she even needed him! Still a 10/10 though and I especially loved it when Finn saved the animals with his girlfriend. Love from Australia!,44,15,OddClancy,dNW0B0HsvVs,0.2972943722943723,2018-02-06 05:23:05,True,True

My only gripe is how they incorporate the Millennium Falcon this early in Han's piloting career. He's supposed to be a gambler, a hustler, a rogue, renegade, roustabout, and a scoundrel, so why couldn't they have introduced a whole plethora of borrowed, hijacked, and stolen spaceships, all with different designs, layouts, sizes, shapes, and functions to add more interest factor to Han's colorful and dangerous life story?

The Expanded Universe both gave us more Star Wars to hold on to, but it also gave each individual their own view of what's Star Wars and what isn't. So what is really ruining this movie?

Star Wars has so much more potential then what Disney is producing. There are so many unexplored eras of the universe and places. In my opinion Disney needs to be done with the original characters and get some new ones in. Ones that actually are good and people care about unlike the the news ones like Mary Sue Rey and fin. Give us the usong vong invasion a thrawn film, old republic (that is the original origins story to everything Star Wars is now) or just make a new era altogether.

Disney could've even approached the situation like Zemeckis did with Back to the Future, i. e. fire the bad actor and re-shoot the film from the start.

2018-02-06T20:09:13,"This might end up being a surprisingly good/funny movie, but I doubt it, judging from the trailer alone.  The story is too cliche to be genuinely interesting.  It follows the same pattern as the rebooted ""Star Trek's"" Captain Kirk when he was a kid.  ""I did something illegal, tried to outrun the police but got caught. I eventually got noticed by a guy who admired my illegal antics.  He took me in and raised me.  He taught me everything I know.""  Neo from the Matrix comes to mind.    My theory for the reason that this is so cringeworthy is that it's just so cliche.  Why make this movie about something we never wanted to see?  You need mystery of a character to keep them 'mysterious'.  Telling every single facet of their early life and how they came to be the mysterious character you loved, is not necessary, nor is it asked for.  This movie (again, just judging from the trailer alone) doesn't seem to offer any new ideas or at least old ideas done with a sense of creativity.  I am just so tired of the saturation of the franchise concept.  Make something original with a massive budget like this one.  All you're really doing, with these kinds of movies, is making a billion dollar ""done it before"" movie that'll be in the bargain bin right next to Aladdin 2: Return of Jafar.",0,0,Castigo,dNW0B0HsvVs,0.06628246753246751,2018-02-06 20:09:13,True,True

The prequels come out and  everyone says ""Does not feel like Star Wars"". Then when the The Force Awakens recreates the feel of the original trilogy people complain ""To much like Episode IV""!  Rogue One one comes out and everybody loves it even though the characters are bland and it realize on to much nostalgia from the original trilogy. Then Last Jedi comes out and people complain about it even though it was a different star wars film.  Now people complain this is different to. So what do you baby's want a original trilogy film or a original one.

It's like they put a black person or a woman in the trailers and the internet lurkers start screaming ""SJW!""  My major grip about this movie is that I didn't hear anyone asking for it. It isn't a story we needed to see. I have heard tons of people wanting a Obi Wan movie, but nothing about Solo, yet, hear we are. If they wanted to pull something out of this era, do a freaking Lando movie. I would have loved to see his rise to power. Something different and new. I actually enjoyed Force Awakens and Rogue One and thought Disney was off to a good start. With how bad TLJ was idk anymore. I have my doubts about this movie. I really don't care too much about it.
