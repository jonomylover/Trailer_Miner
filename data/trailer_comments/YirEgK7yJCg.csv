2020-01-17T20:39:30,"One of The best trailers I have ever seen, period! The editing, the music, the style, the transitions, the added elements of sounds from nature or everyday life just to make the visuals stand out even more..and just the pure joy and fun I have while watching it...everything is done to absolute perfection! It speaks volumes that over two years later, I still come back to it and I enjoy it as if I'm watching it for the first time. To put it simple, this is one of the coolest and slickest trailers I have ever witnessed and I genuinely think that the people who worked on it should be recognized and receive an award if they haven't already. I can speak forever about this trailer and movie, so I'll just simply say a huge congratulations to everyone who worked on this trailer and movie, including of course to the unbelievably talented and absurdly creative mind that is Edgar Wright! :)",1,0,Robert,YirEgK7yJCg,0.33172268907563024,2020-01-17 20:39:30,False,False
