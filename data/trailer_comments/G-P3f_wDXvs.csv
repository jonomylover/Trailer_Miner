2016-10-10T12:09:11,"The best way I can describe my feelings about Jason Statham movies is that they are a guilty pleasure. Sure they are dumb for the most part but on the other hand they are entertaining. Mechanic:Resurrection breaks that rule. It's still dumb but this time it's really really dull.  Statham returns as Arthur Bishop who is forced into carrying out a series of seemingly impossible assassinations to save his girlfriend played by Jessica Alba. The first half hour of this feels like a vanity project. We see Statham and Alba going in and out of the sea , James Bond style , in exotic locations looking like they have just come out of the gym. It's cringeworthy at times. It's obvious that they have both got themselves in good shape for the film but do we have to have it rubbed in our faces? The rest of the film is a series of action sequences with below par special affects mixed Jessica Alba pulling silly faces pretending badly that she is in peril.  This is probably the worst thing I have seen Statham do and to be fair I would rather see Harold Bishop than Athur Bishop if it means me sitting through something like this again.
