2018-01-31T01:21:03,Dear Friends Jesus Christ has a perfect plan for your life. NEVER FORGET THAT! But it is up to you to let Him work in your life. He won't force you. He must always be invited. It requires an ACTIVE pursuit to have a personal relationship with Him. God (through Jesus Christ) desires your active pursuit of Him more than anything else in your life. He desires first place - not second and in doing so NO ONE to Him is more desirable than YOU! He so eagerly desires you to come to that realization dear one. He truly does. This is your starting point with our loving Creator that will last for all eternity. May God bless you in the MIGHTY name of Jesus Christ our Savior. ‚ù§Ô∏è,0,1,msdogooder,V6wWKNij_1M,0.2590277777777778,2018-01-31 01:21:03,True,True

I think people are glossing over the two shots of the brother and sister in the car, then the miniature model of that same shot, except of the daughter hanging out of the window of the car. Seems curious to me that the mom would make that into a miniature model. There is also a sound effect of a car speeding, and the glares at the end look like the reflection of a car's headlights. I think these things have more to do with the story than is being let on. I have a feeling the girl is/was special and the brother had something to do with her dying and he's being haunted by the grandma.

She is about to cut off the bird head before we hear a crackling, which initially we perceive as the sound of the bird's neck being crushed but then it is revealed to be a match being lit, all in a fraction of a second. The random plucking of strings in the soundtrack is just really creepy. The binaural bell sound is weird as heck. The banging sound is introduced a couple shots before we find the source of it, which is first revealed as a knife against a cutting board but is then translated into her banging her head against the floor. We see a woman scream and think the ringing sound playing at the same time is the sound of her scream, but as it lingers we realize it is just a ringing.

I'm a lifelong horror fan, I write horror films, I watch them every day, and have been since before kindergarten. And Hereditary looks like a true game-changer of sorts. When I first saw this trailer, it legit gave me the chills. What frightens me most about it is how little I know. Everything is so ambiguous. I get that Annie Graham (Collette) lost her mother, and that's where it all starts. But I cannot make out or predict ANYTHING else. So I am itching like crazy to see this in theatres. Toni Collette is an amazing actress who seems to be at the top of her game playing a grieving daughter who's somehow sinking into insanity. Debut actress Milly Shapiro is SO creepy-looking, I'm sure she's gonna be the next great addition to the ""creepy kids"" horror clich√© (I mean it in a good way). The bugs crawling on Peter's face in bed, Annie smashing her head against that wall, all those weird cult members swarming about, and Toni Collette's seemingly bone-chilling performance is what makes this movie look so different from standard genre fare.

2018-06-07T16:36:28,"Here‚Äôs is a sort of theory for the movie I have, and I have not seen it yet. The beginning shot of the casket going into the ground is not the grandma. I think that in the casket is the girl(Charlie) who possibly died from being decapatated. I think this because she takes all the heads off of the animals, so I just feel like the demon or dead grandma or whatever is going to troll her by taking her head off. because she cant be seen anywhere in the shot, and later on with the part the mom is talking, she doesn‚Äôt seem too sad that the grandma died. In the trailer later on you can see the mother standing in front of someone burning to death. I think this is the dad because their is another part where the son dies. Here‚Äôs what I got for the son, out of all the trailers released by A24. In the Mother‚Äôs Day trailer, it showed the mother standing over her sons bed saying she wished she wasn‚Äôt his mother. Then it shows someone trying to rip his head off, and later bugs crawling all over his head. Also the mom makes a miniature of the son without a head, so... I think that the whole family will die, starting with the daughter then the father then the son and the mother. The reason I think this will happen is because the daughter obviously dies first because of the shot of the funeral. Then the dad dies, leaving only the mother and the son, which in a trailer with cast interviews, one of the actors, I don‚Äôt remember which, said they didnt have a very good relationship. I‚Äôm not sure how the mother will die, but I think it has something to do with her(possibly) floating up into the treehouse. I‚Äôm not sure what will happen, but since the daughter was decapitated, maybe the mom will get cut up into little pieces or something because she makes the figurines.

For 99% of the film, it's a very familiar horror film of a family suffering from loss of a family member and trying to figure out if something's haunting their family. And then boom -- in the ending we're thrown some weird pagan stuff - where everything that had been built up until that point, including a pretty convincing family drama, just blew up - and nothing made sense in the end.  It's almost as if the screenwriter/director decided to make this a different horror film by adding some angles in the end. But it completely ruined what would have been a pretty decent horror film. I think I heard people laughing and shaking their heads at the ending; I certainly did. Writing is a very difficult art - and every story is a promise. Unfortunately, that promise was not fulfilled in this film -- and none of the characters resolved.

There are a couple of uneasy moments but apart from those it is terrible. The ending is ridiculously bad and a lot of the film made no sense whatsoever. The movie is shot very well by the director but even with that it still doesn't make up for the lack of substance. Numerous long winded scenes of suspense all ended by absolutely nothing whatsoever... it's almost as if they used it as a filler to pad the movie out. Of all the people on the cinema not one single person left saying anything positive whatsoever about it... quite the opposite actually. A lot of people left disgruntled and tired due to it being incredibly boring and a story that doesn't make sense really. Even if I had of rented this movie once it went on Xbox live, and even if it cost ¬£2 to rent... I would still feel as if I had of been ripped off.

2018-06-17T13:42:23,"Shite film in my opinion. You know it‚Äôs bad when people start to uncontrollably laugh throughout the film because it makes absolutely no sense. As well as this the trailer over glorifies the it! I‚Äôd prefer to take a shit in my hands and clap than waste another 2 hours of my life watching this train wreck of a horror! The critics have obviously been paid or forced to make good reviews to attract an audience. Here‚Äôs my honest ratings for this film: 1/10 for story as nothing actually made sense. 4/10 for the editing as the only actually scary part was a bird hitting a window! 5/10 for the props. 4/10 for the acting although i didn‚Äôt feel a connection or understanding with the characters as we were shown no background on what built them till further into the film. 2/10 for events in the story as it is a stereotypical horror film, e.g. someone dies, strange events, deaths, long build up of suspense and tension and then a terrible ending which no one actually understood until they got home and watch a video on explaining the ending and all the secret meanings. Looking at other unprofessional and amateur reviewers ideas on this film are much better for example on person said ‚ÄúWhat a shocking film, was it meant to be funny‚Äù others said that the film is diabolical, a waste of money, no context behind the daughters clucks/clicks, people asking why there were naked dead bodies which some of them were decapitated and old were shown in a film rated 15. To be impartial Jeffery M. Anderson wrote saying ‚ÄúThis clammy, creeping horror film is deeply rooted to the classics from the 1960s, ‚Äò70s and beyond‚Äù This reviewer gave the film a 8/10. Overall i give this film a horrifying 3.2/10 making this rated lower than Winchester (2018), Leprechaun Origins (2014), The Ouija Experiment (2013) and even Killer Tomatoes Strike Back! If you want to watch a real horror, try watching the Insidious trilogy and The Conjuring films! Audiences beware of this film, it will waste two hours of your time and it will ruin your evening.

Without stating the spoilers it does have some creepy scenes that could have been explored more but the ending was sloppily, hastily and even far fetched all the while considering it's a movie containing the paranormal. Reviewers please stop comparing it to The Exorcist. We don't need another Exorcist anyhow. Let's face it, the creepyness is mainly due to the strange appearance of the little girl. This movie is more like Bad Ben with a bigger buget, poltergeist with a weaker script, The Shining with decapitation or The Witch + Insidious have a baby. This film could've had so much potential. I could think of plenty of ways that the second half could've gone and would've been more plausible, enjoyable and actually scary. But instead we are left with a Night M.

2018-06-23T18:47:33,"I so badly want to say that I loved it and it was worth all the praise, but it would feel wrong to say that. I really wanted to like this movie going in. Honestly though, it isn't the holy grail of horror movies, it isn't a modern horror classic. I love horror movies and have seen so many of them since I were a little child. I have also seen fair share of disturbing, provoking and chilling movies and those that make you feel nauseous and like you want to throw up. This movie wasn't ""too disgusting for me"" and it didn't go over my head. The problem is just that it's honestly just a letdown. It spends a lot of time establishing key elements, the atmosphere, building expectations and suspense, but when it comes to perfecting them and finally reaching the climax, it falls flat. At points it feels like you're not knowing what you should really be afraid of. The film seems to juggle different elements and plots without fully developing them and then expecting the audience to get everything. There were honestly many scenes that still seem like stuff that should have maybe been left out. When your audience is confused and even laughs at the theater (yes, there were people genuinely howling from laughter, not just using it as a coping mechanism), you know you have failed to really get the point across.   I love the fact that it didn't focus on cheap jumpscares and that it carefully molded expectations and reached to the human psyche. The acting was spot on, I absolutely adore the symbolism, foreshadowings, classic horror elements and the whole atmosphere of the movie. It had the technicalities right and the art side right. It was really ambitious and well done and beats so many modern horror movies, but the hype and praise kind of ruin it honestly. If I would have seen this blindly I would have been more pleasantly surprised of it. Of course, that still wouldn't have made the movie more clearer. This movie would have needed serious polishing and by so many little tweaks it would have been better. This movie had what it takes to be a classic, but it' leans toward being that typical cult horror movie.

Reading all these reviews about what a ""Masterpiece"" this movie is makes me wonder if I missed something or if I'm just stupid. If you're someone who's raving about how creative and legendary this movie is, you're either just trying to fit in as a horror movie person or saw a completely different movie. Seriously, I sat there through the first hour of the movie and wondered if I somehow walked into the wrong theater and was seeing a different movie. The first half of the movie just seemed to keep me waiting and waiting and waiting for something sensible to happen.   The only positive thing about this movie is the acting. The movie does have good performances from Toni Collette, although I don't feel her acting is ""Oscar worthy"" like people are saying.   In the end, there's nothing to spoil about this movie because nothing happens. The plot develops extremely slowly as a poorly written family drama. Then in the last 20-30 minutes the director must have remembered that he was supposed to be making a horror movie and just slapped together an ending full of countless scary movie cliches that left everyone in the theater scratching their heads. My instant reaction after the movie ended was ‚ÄúWhat did I just watch‚Äù   I get that cinematography wise this movie is supposed to be brilliant, because it does look pretty good. But good visuals aren't enough to save a boring movie with a poorly put together plot in my opinion. I've seen a few other reviewers on here mention how people in the audience were laughing out loud during the ""scary"" parts of this movie, and I can say that most of the theater I was in, including myself, was filled with people laughing and making jokes at how confusing the ending of this movie is.   DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO WATCH IT IN THE CINEMA. You may want to see it at home if you like because there‚Äôs nothing special about it that‚Äôll give u chills in the movie theatre. I‚Äôm so sick of artsy type ‚Äúhorror movies‚Äù.

Only thing I want to point out is that it's okay to not like the movie, it might not be your thing, for however reason, if you enjoy more jump scary common ones or slasher horror movies, whatever. Two things I don't think are okay: First, showing up to say ""This movie sucks. I want my money back"" like a dumb kid who didn't like the food they ordered at a restaurant, it helps in no way and makes you look like an idiot. Want to give your piece of criticism and why you didn't like it? Perfectly fine, do it like an adult. Second, people who liked the movie and immediatly put down anyone who didn't as ""your IQ must be low, you didn't get it"", probably just as stupid as hating with no argument to back it up, you make people who enjoyed the movie look like snobs with no real reasons as to why they enjoyed it, also doesn't help in the conversation at all and you will never convince anyone to give the movie you liked another try or a second viewing just by insulting them.

It had a lot of promise at the start but in the end it just became total utter senseless BULLSHIT! Somehow the audience is supposed to believe that there is a cult who have been trying to summon this demon Paimon for generations and finally they acheive this through a series of serendipetous coincidences and bizzare activities that seem totally absurd, illogical and unnecessary. I mean If this demon Paimon needed a male host why didn't that Joan character just kidnap the boy, kill him and then let the demon take his body. Oh the demon needs three decapitated heads? Then why didn't Joan or the Grandmother just decapitate three people and use their heads and bodies in the ritual. Somehow the audience is supposed to believe that Joan and the grandmother conspired with this demon Paimon to get him into the body of grandson (Peter), even to the extent that we have to assume that Paimon and Joan got together to come up with the brilliant plan to set up a fake seance reaction to convince the mother (Annie) that Joan was able to summon the spirit of her ""dead grandson"" Louis. I mean WTF?  Once again this demonstrate the absurdity and utter lack of imagination of the  writers. Such convoluted nonsense!

Not many films make me genuinely uneasy, but this one definitely did.  There have been some pretty highly critically acclaimed scary movies in the last few years, and as much as I loved ""The Witch"", ""It Follows"", ""The Babadook"", ""It Comes At Night"" and ""A Quiet Place"".....none of these chilled me half as much as ""Hereditary"". The entire cast is perfection but Toni Collette is astonishing, not surprised, but she can go really deep and heavy, it would be difficult to comprehend if she wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this performance.  And I think Alex Wolff's performance helped pull the thing off...he's brilliant.   ""Hereditary"" sits comfortable next to ""The Shining"", ""The Wicker Man"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Thing"", ""The Witch"" and a few of my other favorite horror films....thinking back on those after seeing this one, they don't seem quite as scary? I gotta get in a couple more viewings in the next months to be sure, but it just might end up being my favorite horror film of all time.

2018-09-12T03:09:50,"Ari Aster is talented, but I don't think he's quite hit his stride just yet. Hereditary has an excellent first half, with strong performances and an ominous mood that's helped in no small part by the droning score that's played throughout virtually the entire film. But things start to unravel in the second half. Don't get me wrong, I respect any film that TRIES to do something different these days. It's a rare thing, indeed. But without giving anything away, while the story was wildly unpredictable towards the end, it didn't end up as something I found particularly interesting. And there was also this very forced juxtaposition between Toni Collette's unhinged and hysterical overacting (good but extreme) and the rest of the cast, which was as stiff and wooden as the little dolls in Toni's doll houses. But the worst part for me was how the film just tried too hard to be strange and different. If you want to be strange and different, you'd better make sure that the story you're telling is compelling enough to support all the camera trickery, weird angles and artificial shots. And I just don't think the story was good enough to do that.  This was like watching something by David Lynch, but without his masterful style and genuine feel for the bizarre. It felt as if I was watching a big budget student film, with way better performances than it deserved.  I'm still looking forward to seeing what Ari can come up with in the future. But so far, while he's taken a step in the right direction, he's got neither a map or a compass to follow yet.",0,0,teppolundgren,V6wWKNij_1M,0.07239989177489176,2018-09-12 03:09:50,False,False

They've mistook halfway decent pacing with immersion and craft. In fact, some of the camera moves were clumsy and often without ""motivation"" in the action. This film was simply a dime-a-dozen demon flick. I hope the success of the film will encourage some directors to change editing styles, but that's about all this forgettable movie can contribute to 2018. A similar recent movie, ""It Follows"", was a bit  better. It didn't rely on gore and silly demonic physics. However, if a movie is made in the 2000s or twenty-teens, you can be fairly sure it's garbage. If people found the style of the film refreshing, I suggest they return to the Classics.",1,1,Zachary A.,V6wWKNij_1M,0.04583333333333334,2018-09-30 16:53:37,False,False

2018-10-14T17:41:32,"I can think of four reasons a person wouldn't like this movie. The first is exposure, it's best to go in knowing nothing, massive expectations will have you enter the theatre with a critical mind and leave you disappointed. It is pretty impossible for a movie to be the scariest movie ever for everyone, given different things scare different people and the experience is entirely subjective. So get that catch phrase out of your head and expect nothing. The second is where you get your kicks, I find jumpscares to be a reflex, like the knee jerk reaction. If you're very physically focused then this is probably all it takes to satisfy your horror needs, and If that's the case Hereditary might be a big yawn fest for you. The third is whether you are an empathic person, much of the horror is delivered via empathy with the characters, if you don't empathise naturally then it'll go right over your head. And the fourth is just not liking/tolerating horror and disturbing content, but it's unlikely you're watching heredity if that's the case. I'd say there are good indicators of whether you'll like this based on what you've liked before,  if you liked scream and hostel, this'll probably be terrible to you, if you like nordic noir and artsy indie movies about horrible things happening in terrible places, you might like this. I've watched tons of horror(including foreign) and honestly I've never seen anything like it, and for me that was a good thing. It's in my top two most memorable movies of any genre. (second place to incendies which is perfection imo). A definite standout.",2,0,Something Shiney,V6wWKNij_1M,0.009829931972789113,2018-10-14 17:41:32,False,False

The characters are complex and are easy to get invested into and the actors do a fantastic job of giving out some great performances.  Although If l had to pick who gave the best performance in the movie, it would be Milly Shapiro as Charlie Graham. She did such a great job of making her character feel creepy. Every time she came on screen, I felt uncomfortable.  If I had any complaints about this film, is that the pacing can be really slow at times, but the payoff at the end of the film makes up for the slow pacing.  I absolutely love this movie. It's a film that I've been thinking a lot about ever since I first watched it. I'm sure there's a lot of hidden details about this film when I first watched it and I can't wait to watch it again to see if I discover any new things that I didn't see when I first watched it.

( I did that mistake) I watched it and I can't get any sleep. If I was lucky enough to have some sleep, It would be nightmares.  And I'm not the only one. Almost everyone became hysterically ill after watching this film. It's extremely extremely disturbing. I have watched films of the same horror genre like Mother!, Get Out, The Witch; films that have this peculiar eerie vibe and films that affect you on many levels and is especially disturbing . Horror film fanatics will love this film. If you haven't been scared by any horror film then I assure you this one is like no other. If it will not scare you then it will definitely disturb you for a long time. It is really terrifying and the imagery is terrifyingly violent and is still stuck in my mind and the music makes it even worse. I find it to be honest very impressive yet unsettling how it's the debut film for Ari Aster, the director and writer. You can't be normal to write and direct such film and at such a young age (not too young, 30/31, but still). Overall it's an exceptional film yet I don't recommend it for anyone. I would recommend reading the synopsis about the film or have an idea about it. It will help you prepare mentally. It would be more disturbing to watch it without knowing a thing about it.     An advice don't read about the film after watching it. It will disturb you even further.",0,0,rosie seokjinie,V6wWKNij_1M,-0.03857323232323231,2019-01-20 06:08:26,False,False

The storytelling could have been improved (it's kind of hard to enjoy the final gag when there's confusion afoot) and there could have been more scares (but the ones that did happen were totally unique). This movie was a devastatingly forward looking take on the same old story, but you will literally enjoy it more the second time you watch it because then you actually know what's going on. This was the directorial debut of a writer, and it probably shouldn't have been. He should've waited five years before writing/directing this because it needed refining. It's really a quite simple story-there is no need for the audience to be confused and have to go on Wikipedia just to figure out what actually happened in the end. It could've been a masterpiece if the writer/director had more experience under his belt but the unrefined final product was still ultimately fantastic. Should've been a home run with all audiences. Instead it's a gag for those who have the patience to sit through two hours of borderline hogwash to get to the best part- the reveal.",0,0,Ottiti Spiti,V6wWKNij_1M,0.15651515151515152,2019-11-04 03:30:32,False,False

The word 'superlative' comes to mind, no matter what movie part I've seen her play or do.  The best compliment I can conceivably come up with to pay Toni Collette is as this here:  Even though the two ladies were two different actresses from two different times in life; if anyone would be deserving of a  ""Bette Davis Award"" trophy (vs the fictitious Sara Siddons Award in her 1950 movie All About Eve), if there were such an award given today (and there should be by now!), it would go to Toni Collette hands down!
