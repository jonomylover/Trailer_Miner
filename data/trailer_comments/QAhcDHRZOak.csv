I say this because I'm Canadian and I just saw a sub being blown up in the Arvtic North I presume ... wtf who's cleaning up that environmental mess?

2019-01-16T22:09:13,"Despite the obvious negative reviews of the film, I decided to watch it, just for the giggles. It was by no means a smart film... but to my surprise, it was a fun film. I mean sure, a situation like that would never have happened, and I am not even talking about US submarine rescuing a Russian president fro a coup attempt. I am talking about a coup itself - westerners have a strange and somewhat comic picture of what Russia is and how it works. But that aside, it was actually a fun action packed film - as long as you don't project real life politics into it.  And why would you - it is a film of a made up scenario.  The one thing that spoiled the fun and the narrative presented is near the very end. SPOILER INCOMING!  When the crew of the Russian destroyer fires at the coup command center. At one point, they protect the US submarine because their former commander and mentor, as well as president, is on board that sub. That is fine. But then, as a response, they fire into a base where hundreds if not thousands of their friends are stationed, just following orders, probably not knowing what is going on.  They could have fired at those surface to sea missile battery or something similar, prevent the damage to US sub while doing minimum damage to their countrymen and alerting the entire Russian military.  But no, they fired at their own base with thousands of their countrymen.  Apart from that, the storytelling was, if not realistic, at least logical to some extent. Or better said, it followed one logic, no matter how ridiculous it was. But then, at an instant, the logic that you've built upon, is broken. So even if you decided to enjoy a rather funny action flick, the film kicks you in the nuts with one scene at the end. Instead of it, they could have had a scene where the destroyer alerts the fleet and the army and Russian choppers with Spetsnaz start landing and arresting the defense minister, killing the minister's lap dog (commander of his personal guard) in the process.  It would have been a better ending, in accord with logic whey worked with through the entire film.  So even if I come from the anti-American surroundings, I actually had fun watching it. Just shut off your brain and enjoy an action flick. As you would with Rambo or some sci-fi film. It's a made up story, don't get real world politics into it. If you can't take off political glasses off, then skip the film. I mean I watched it as I would Iron Sky - a crazy over the top story with some action. So it was fun. If you go into it wanting a realism of a historic documentary, fine, just watch it and bitch about it alone, don't spoil the fun for others.",1,0,–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä –ú–∞—Ç–∏—õ,QAhcDHRZOak,0.06326232247284878,2019-01-16 22:09:13,False,True

At the same time, a Navy SEAL team under the command of Lieutenant Bill Beaman is sent in to discreetly observe a Russian naval base, but their mission is swiftly complicated when Martinelli, the team's new DM recruit, is rendered unconscious during the HALO drop. When they arrive at the naval base, they witness defense minister Dmitri Durov conducting a coup d'eta and taking Russian President Zakarin prisoner, and swiftly realize that Durov intends to trigger a war.
