It makes me sick seeing people praise PARANORMAL ACTIVITY as one of the best horror movies and say how scary it was. The movie sucked and it was a cheap attempt at making money, which it did. Overhyped garbage. Damn. Child's Play was more creepy than this. Some people say how ""it's scary because you CAN'T see it..""
