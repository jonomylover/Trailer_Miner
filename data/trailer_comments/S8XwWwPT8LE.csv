2016-05-14T04:25:13,"I really don't like this concept. Other than the girl, who seems a little sympathetic, the other two teens just come off as dumb kids. Plus, the premise and a few of the details REALLY irk me. First is how stupid these kids are, just traipsing into a house like it's no big deal that they are trespassing into a house that they don't seem to know the layout of, and don't appear to have a backup plan or any tools on them to try and GET the money.  Second is that the blind guy CAN feasibly get away with acting in self-defense to his house being invaded, despite how much of a twist this is on the home invasion genre, and that makes him a bit sympathetic. The reason home invasion movies work is that we, as humans, root for the underdogs most of the time, and the blind guy has a disability and numerical advantage working in his favor, as anyone looking at these comments can see. Third is that this whole scenario could have been avoided if the kids actually tried to plan out the robbery, or did some research on their target. In fact, the best opportunity to strike wouldn't have been under cover of night, but during a time WHEN HE CAN BE LOCKED OUTSIDE OF HIS HOUSE. Go in, secure the entrances to make sure he doesn't try to enter them via a hidden key, have multiple plans of egress, especially if he goes to the neighbors and calls the cops, and get the money! Or figure out a way to subdue him quietly and stealthily, THEN have carte blanche to his house!

Because there could have been a horror movie that really scared me or that I really liked but if another director took the same elements and crammed it into his horror movie, that doesn't mean that I find it worth a damn. So a couple movies for example that show the elements of being afraid for me, The Blair Witch, The Ring but not because of the girl that comes from the well. It's more because of the tape than anything else as well as those quick shots of how the victims look after Samantha kills them. Stir of Echoes because of the shock value when first finding out that the dead girls body was in the wall. And Shutter although I don't remember much of it. So for me, it's more of a....we don't know whats going on, something tormented is tormenting us, really tormenting imagery like the tape that nobody knows where it came from or who or how it was made, I really want to feel the chill when i'm watching it. If I could say what kind of design I like, I would point to something like the Janitor from Silent Hill.
