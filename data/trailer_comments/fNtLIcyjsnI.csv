2017-11-10T02:05:43,"Lame. Wakeup people.  This world; Its ALL biblical. We are the last generation. Evil is rampant because Satan knows his time is coming to a close he is trying hard to drag all to hell with him. He's doing a fine job. People are all in a deep sleep and care only about being entertained ""trying"" to be famous and shopping in strip mall's and listening to terrible satanically inspired music etc. Its a Godless world and all will be totally surprised when Jesus comes and they get left to deal with Satan in reality with all his demons which instead of being invisible will be completely visible to the naked eye. Only then will people believe this world is all one giant spiritual battle. Jesus died for us, loves us, and wants us to escape hell which is an actual place.   Toss aside this temporary world. If you do not know Jesus Christ or believe in God, I urge you to start. Whether you believe or not does not change the fact that The One and Only Jesus Christ is on his way....shortly. Like days. How many? Not sure. But my spirit feels it. This world is messed up. You must admit that. Its all a lie...all the things you think make you happy are lies. The devil hates you and is laughing at you. Jesus loves you. He died for you and the entire world. Even if you don't¬† love him. He is waiting for you to receive him in your heart. He is a gentleman...He WILL NOT enter your heart unless YOU ask him to! If you are ready to receive Jesus into your heart pray this prayer before it's too late. This is an urgent warning. Pray: Jesus I am a sinner, I believe you died on the cross for me and my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sins I am repenting now and I ask you to enter my heart right now. Change me. I want to make you happy. I want to be happy and go to heaven. I do not want to be stuck in the tribulation. Help me to open my spiritual eyes and ears before you get here. I ask this in Jesus name Amen!   If you just prayed this prayer welcome to the family! You made the most important decision of your life right now. Don't stop praying and remember a prayer can be a simple as ""Jesus, help me!""¬† now get a bible or an app and read about revelation. And read Matthew and John chapters. For a start. I pray you made the right decision and prayed that prayer.
