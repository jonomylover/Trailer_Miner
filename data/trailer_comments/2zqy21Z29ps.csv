The king of the Persian Zirxces was told of a path to flank the Spartans. He took advantage. Althoug Leonitus knew about this path and had and army from a neighboring state awaiting to protect them but the army retreated thinking more about themselves then honoring Leonitusʻ request. Leonitus Found out and strategically sent back all the 7,000 troops but his 300 Spartans. 1,000 other troops fom another state devoted themslves also and stayed. The Spartans fought with all their might to allow as much time as for the army to retreat. These mighty Spartans and their great king gave up so much as their own lives for the good of their own country. This is the real truth behind the 300 Spartans and their great heroic stand at Thermopylae. Great heroic story that is honored. Just like other great stories like David and Goliath.

2014-02-05T22:01:56,Everybody needs to stop hating on this movie. I agree with you all when yoj say the movie is not historically accurate because that is true. This move is only like 60% accurate according to actual history. Persia was not as cruel and twosted as this mobie make it seem. Yes there was some unjust things that they did but that wasnt happening the whole time Persia was a strong Empire. Persia did in fact go to war with Greece but they went to war mainly with Athens becaus  of its strong navy and military force. Yes Persia also went tp war with Sparta but not until after they battled Athens. Also they did not do all the terrible things to the people like the movie may state. Yes they did some bad thing but that was before they even went to war with Greece. So i understand that the. But the movie is only meant to be slightly historical and its more just for people to watch and enjoy. Because you know how most people are. Thay like violence killing and explosions. So please stop hating so much. Its not accurate so what. Its just meant to entertain gore loving people,0,0,James McElwee,2zqy21Z29ps,0.046825396825396826,2014-02-05 22:01:56,True,True

This was the beginning of the Ionian Revolt, which would last until 493 BC, progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflict. Aristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria, and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis. The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this act. The revolt continued, with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497–495 BC. In 494 BC, the Persians regrouped, and attacked the epicentre of the revolt in Miletus. At the Battle of Lade, the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat, and the rebellion collapsed, with the final members being stamped out the following year. would you not attack if you were the strongest empire in your time? tell me i would like to know. you know  i love history and Persia did not have such bad history in fact people who made this movie were bias if they werent they would of bring reasons for persia to attack greece not bringing crap with that stupid bold guy make him Xerxes i mean really thats just the worst movie i ever watched and it disrespected my culture and i will never forgive that       ",7,0,Prince of Persia,2zqy21Z29ps,0.016605090311986873,2014-02-08 18:23:53,True,True

Persia had conquered the known world, civilizations that were far in advanced of persia, Babylon(ex). They then attempted to conquer what is now called Greece(Hellas) with treaties with Carthage to make sure the Greeks from Sicily and Calabria(Magna Graecia) would not come to it's aid. In plain words the whole Mediterranean Region was involved. It took them 10 yrs to set it up, built roads, supply lines. 1 million or more army, two pontoon Bridges across the Bosporus Strait, 1500 ships that could carry 250 or more men, 200 supply ships,  the persian LOST, at Salamis, and I yr later a Mycale(Sea) and Plataea(land). They never returned again they were defeated by 30,000 United Greeks. That's Greek history. By the way Persia started in 550 BC, Greece was around and colonizing the Aegean & Ionian coastline for 600 yrs prior the first persian even seeing the Mediterranean. They did it by sailing ,by trade, advancing their culture to a cultureless areas not conquering. Now as to your question would have Greece or the World been better off if the Persians had Won.  Of course not. There never would have been a democracy. Has one come about anywhere in the World without it’s basic knowledge of Greece. Has one come to the Middle East even with it's knowledge. Has a Ruler ever been good in those locations or for the most part anywhere else. NO! Have empires been cruel, certainly everyone has.. Even the Romans came to Athens to learn of it. It was the base of its Republic Democracy. How did the Republic of Rome fair after the Caesars took over? If it hadn't been for Cincinnatus do you think George Washington would have stepped down?  Napoliean when asked why he tried his comeback, his response was ""Who do you think I am George Washington"". (Cincinnatus was George's historical mentor)..Without Greece that would have never Happened.  As to slaves and the conquest of 'Might makes right',  That’s exactly how the Persians Ruled and Conquered. By the way Darius 1 slaughtered castrated 1000's boys and girls of the Revolting Ionian City States and he enslaved the woman using the boys a eunuchs and the woman/ girls as concubines. Xerxes did the same to Babylon and Egypt. You see my facts are better then your flawed theory. As to a weaken Greece because of it's civil war and Philip and then Alexander conquering what remained. Well at least he was Greek and then he Destroyed Persia. It's Called Revenge. Greeks don't take to others directing them or taking away their Freedom.

2014-02-11T04:55:56,"The Persian Empire(  550–330 BC), or First Persian Empire,[11] was an empire in Western and Central Asia, founded in the 6th century BC by Cyrus the Great.[11] The dynasty draws its name from king Achaemenes, who ruled Persis between 705 BC and 675 BC. The empire expanded to eventually rule over significant portions of the ancient world, which at around 500 BC stretched from the Indus Valley in the east to Thrace and Macedon on the northeastern border of Greece. The Persian Empire would eventually control Egypt as well. It was ruled by a series of monarchs who unified its disparate tribes and nationalities by constructing a complex network of roads. By the 600s BC, the Persians (Parsa)[12] had settled in the southwest Iranian plateau, bounded on the west by the Tigris River and on the south by the Persian Gulf; this region came to be their heartland.[13] It was from this region that Cyrus the Great would advance to defeat the Kingdom of Media, the Kingdom of Lydia, and the Babylonian Empire, to form the Persian Empire. At the height of its power after the conquest of Egypt, the empire encompassed approximately 8 million square kilometers[14] spanning three continents: Asia, Africa and Europe. At its greatest extent, the empire included the modern territories of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt as far west as Libya, Turkey, Thrace and Macedonia, much of the Black Sea coastal regions, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, much of Central Asia, Afghanistan, northern Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and parts of Oman and the UAE.[6][7] It is noted in Western history as the antagonist foe of the Greek city states[13] during the Greco-Persian Wars, for emancipation of slaves including the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity, and for instituting infrastructures such as a postal system, road systems, and the usage of an official language, Aramaic, throughout its territories. The empire had a centralised, bureaucratic administration under the King and a large professional army and civil services, inspiring similar developments in later empires.[15] The delegation of power to local governments eventually weakened the king's central authority, causing resources to be expended in attempts to subdue local rebellions.[13] This accounts for the dis-unification of the region by the time Alexander the Great invaded Persia in 334 BC. This viewpoint however is challenged by some modern scholars who argue that the Persian Empire was not facing any such crisis around the time of Alexander, and that only internal succession struggles within the Persian family ever came close to weakening the empire.[13] Alexander, an avid admirer of Cyrus the Great,[16] would eventually cause the collapse of the empire and its disintegration around 330 BC into what later became the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Seleucid Empire, in addition to other minor territories which gained independence at that time. The Persian culture of the central plateau, however, continued to thrive and eventually reclaimed power by the 2nd century BC.[13] The historical mark of the Persian Empire went far beyond its territorial and military influences and included cultural, social, technological and religious influences as well. Many Athenians adopted Persian customs in their daily lives in a reciprocal cultural exchange,[17] some being employed by, or allied to the Persian kings. The impact of Cyrus the Great's Edict of Restoration is mentioned in Judeo-Christian texts and the empire was instrumental in the spread of Zoroastrianism as far east as China. Even Alexander the Great, the man who would set out to conquer this vast empire, would respect its customs, by enforcing respect for the royal Persian kings including Cyrus the Great, and even by appearing in proskynesis, a Persian royal custom, despite stern Macedonian disapproval.[18][19] The Persian Empire would also set the tone for the politics, heritage and history of modern Persia (now called Iran).[20] In 480 BC, it is estimated that 50 million[4] people lived in the Persian Empire.[21]",4,0,Prince of Persia,2zqy21Z29ps,0.14539532794249774,2014-02-11 04:55:56,True,True

This was the beginning of the Ionian Revolt, which would last until 493 BC, progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflict. Aristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria, and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis. The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this act. The revolt continued, with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497–495 BC. In 494 BC, the Persians regrouped, and attacked the epicentre of the revolt in Miletus. At the Battle of Lade, the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat, and the rebellion collapsed, with the final members being stamped out the following year. would you not attack if you were the strongest empire in your time? tell me i would like to know. you know    i love history and Persia did not have such bad history in fact people who made this movie were bias if they werent they would of bring reasons for persia to attack greece not bringing crap with that stupid bold guy make him Xerxes i mean really thats just the worst movie i ever watched and it disrespected my culture and i will never forgive that",3,0,Prince of Persia,2zqy21Z29ps,0.016605090311986873,2014-02-17 00:53:19,True,True

2014-02-22T07:23:27,"see the truth behind real Greece that every one love and the reason people say west is Greece is because of a bad relation with Persia(Iran) today you know nothing about politics nor history, you are a pretender or a childish kid who excepts the lies, i mean come on don't you get it already!, they are trying to make people to think Persians are bad 10,375,370 this many people.Real Persians are indoEuropeans and religion is Zoroastrian one of the very first religions, not Muslim. Persians fought Arabs in around The Muslim conquest of Persia, also known as the Arab conquest of Iran led to the end of the Sasanian Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Iran. Arabs first attacked the Sassanid territory in 633, when general Khalid ibn Walid invaded Mesopotamia (what is now Iraq), which was the political and economic center of the Sassanid state.[3] Following the transfer of Khalid to the Roman front in the Levant, the Muslims eventually lost their holdings to Iranian counterattacks. The second invasion began in 636 under Saad ibn Abi Waqqas, when a key victory at the Battle of Qadisiyyah led to the permanent end of Sasanian control west of Iran. The Zagros mountains then became a natural barrier and border between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Sassanid Empire. Owing to continuous raids by Persians into the area, Caliph Umar ordered a full invasion of the Sasanian Iranian empire in 642, which was completed with the complete conquest of the Sasanians around 651. The quick conquest of Iran in a series of well coordinated multi-pronged attacks, directed by Caliph Umar from Medina several thousand miles from the battlefields in Iran, became his greatest triumph, contributing to his reputation as a great military and political strategist. Iranian historians have sought to defend their forebears by using Arab sources to illustrate that ""contrary to the claims of some historians, Iranians, in fact, fought long and hard against the invading Arabs."" By 651, most of the urban centers in nces and Transoxiana, had come under the domination of the Arab armies. Many localities in Iran staged a defense against the invaders, but in the end none was able to repulse the invasion. Even after the Arabs had subdued the country, many cities rose in rebellion, killing the Arab governor or attacking their garrisons, but reinforcements from the caliphs succeeded in putting down all these rebellions and imposing the rule of Islam. The violent subjugation of Bukhara after many uprisings is a case in point. Conversion to Islam was, however, only gradual. In the process, many acts of violence took place, Zoroastrian scriptures were burnt and many mobads executed. Once conquered politically, the Persians began to reassert themselves by maintaining Persian language and culture. Regardless, Islam was adopted by many, for political, socio-cultural or spiritual reasons, or simply by persuasion, and became the dominant religion. ",3,0,Prince of Persia,2zqy21Z29ps,0.12045524691358024,2014-02-22 07:23:27,True,True

They wrote the first charter of human rights after freeing the jews from the babylonians. In those human rights it says no human should be treated different because of heritage (race) or their faith (religion). They also abolished slavery, slavery was FORBIDDEN. All workers were given a steady pay.  The persian achaemenid empire is the most peaceful empire you could ever find. Compare it to all other empires that existed after it. The rest were all ruthless killers. Like it or not.  The truth hurts.  My father has read old books about the persian empire and the greek-persian conflict and shared the stories with me. (Stories that were written by GREEK HISTORIANS) The conflict was ONLY about gaining new territory for the persians, and keeping it for the greeks.

The only free countries are the ones located in North & south America and CHINESE EMPIRE is about to strike them hard. The only relative obstacle is the US and its states.  The US states are more independent and sometimes are in direct fight against its other, because they have different political & social ethics. 2 states are the dominant ones: NY in the East (ATHENS) & LA in the West (SPARTA). NY is more liberal, democratic & artistic society and LA is more conservative & militarized. NY has the best navy forces & LA has the best army.  The Chinese Empire invades, everyone is afraid and about to give up and then LA (SPARTA) sends few men for a last stand, to awaken the rest of the states with their sacrifice. If they don’t resist, every country in North & South America will collapse and surrender in just a few weeks. The last stand take place in Florida (Thermopylae) and then the Chinese forces march to conquer NY. A united force of NY (Athenians) and LA (Spartans) {NY leads the force} decide to face them in a sea battle. They win but the main Chinese force is still intact and camped somewhere in Mississippi.  The next months, united armies under LA (SPARTA) leadership face them in a battle (Plataea) and although outnumbered 12:1 they defeat them and throw them out of US, destroying practically their dreams for WORLD DOMINATION . The next 50 years there is a constant war between NY & LA for territorial purposes   ( NY has more blame for this war) and finally LA wins. But in fact there is no winner and the Chinese Empire is happy to see both states suffer, thinking that will have a better chance to invade in the future. But from this war, another dominant state is emerging that rules for the next 20 years and this is CHICAGO (THEVA).  CHINESE EMPIRE interferes constantly with US and trying to harm them, but then the dominant state of US becomes for the first time KENTACKY (MACEDONIA), which is consider from the other states , the redneck state and for the last 400 years hasn’t got any great achievements to show.  But KENTACKY (MACEDONIA) succeeds ( FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY OF US) to unite all of the states and they strike Chinese Empire in order to free the rest of the world. They succeeded….  ",0,0,medvet,2zqy21Z29ps,0.15354938271604937,2014-02-23 12:25:27,True,True

He was a drunken Lunatic. Cyrus the Great is the only man in my opinion who deserves to be called ""the great""! not for the amount of land he conquered, rather more like he liberated, but because of the values he set forth, he founded the Persian Empire and abolished slavery from the very beginning and defined 5 years ago Human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to practice whatever faith every person desires. His ideas were unknown in the ancient world. The significant role of women in Ancient Iran both horrified and fascinated the ancient greek and Roman male-dominated societies. We were the 1st nation on earth to have women as emperors, Generals, admirals, army commanders, and leaders! They had the same exact rights as men, something they don't have today in America 2500 years after the formation of Persian Empire plus they were highly respected because Persian culture puts women in the highest rank of society unlike arabs, romans, and Greeks. Persian Empire at its height exceeded the size, power, and wealth of Roman empire by two folds. The Romans attacked Persia 3 times under Jovian, Julian and finally Valerian at the battle of Carhae in which he lost ALL his army to glorious Persians and he himself was taken prisoner and forced to bow down before Iranian Emperor: 5 years ago Shapur I of Iran. Then he was used as a foot stool for his majesty to get on his force. That was the biggest embarrassment for Romans and their greatest defeat ever. Then Persians and Romans became allies and fought bloody as brothers-in-arms against the ruthless arabs. It's a smart way that Islamic republic hangs the converts to keep the statistics of muslims high and show the world a false image that majority of Iranians are muslim, we're NOT! we despise arabs and we are proud to be Iranians.   Long Live a free Iran: The land of the Aryans.",3,0,Prince of Persia,2zqy21Z29ps,0.07841066919191919,2014-02-27 06:39:30,True,True

Look forward to the film but they hairstyles of the Spartans would suit modern day New York and not Sparta. The Spartans grew their hair if they were going to war and this was very important to them. Education, training, Hair, Hoplon, doru, kopis a Spartans possessions. They were not democratic like the Athenians and kept a race of slaves Helots which were Dorians. They were a race that believed in purity and the elimination of weakness and killed every child that did not meet their standards. These were the standards adopted by the Nazis. Fortunately for the rest of us the Nazis did not adopt the most important part of the Spartan life which the Americans and British did understand. This is the importance of women in war efforts. While they could be admired as warriors I do not believe they are a race that could be or should be glorified in the sense that the Athenians could be.

It is derived from Old-Persian, Avestan.   That's why today Brother in english is Baradar in Persian, or Star in English is Setareh in Persian, Mother is Madar and Bad is the exact same word; Bad.

Did you knew that after all that, various Greek rulers and influent politicians (including Spartan) turned against him after some decisions he made that looked ""too revolutionary""?  Themistocles went to live in exile in Argos, but his ""old time friends"" kept conspirating against him, accusing him of crimes that he never commited.  At last, it's said that the Great Hero ""lost faith"" in his homeland representatives (he actually fled from Greece in terror), and went to ASIA, where he served Artaxerxes I (King of PERSIA and son of XERXES I !!!) for the rest of his life.

If you go through history you will find between all of so many Gerco-Persian wars the only war which Greek could conquer Persians has been the 'Battle of Gaugamela' which alexander could defeat Dariush III and could reach the old Greek desires! at that time, but within the rest of so many and many of Greco-Persian wars during thousands of years Persians have been conqueror and Persians ruled and dominated the Empire. This historical fact shows Achaemenian and also Xeroxes, one of the Achaemenid dynasty kings  has been so great . This is so funny to me, this is really the power of Holly wood actually they are able to show what ever they want, they show the Greek defeats as honour (300 movie) and also the Greek only one conquer (Alexandre the great movie) as again their glory!!  :)) but this a good amusing movie although with faking the other countries great and old ancient history!, as an Iranian hope everybody enjoy this movie and the 3D Visual Effects!",2,0,suren gt,2zqy21Z29ps,0.26875,2014-03-09 02:15:36,False,True

You are watching a Hollywood product and have no idea even what the real history is about? and where civilization began? Where women had no value in Athens, Persian women were queens and the General of the Navy. Great Western """" philosophers like Plato and Aristotle had the dream to be considered as Persian citizens like Pythagoras, you know why? because the Persian monarchy and aristocracy state control was much more better than Athens lottery democracy. Jews and other religions were slaves in athens city-state, but the Jews had the same rights as everyone else (Zartoshtian) Persians during the Achaemenid Empire, Parthian Empire and Sasanian Empire.   _DO NOT forget CYRUS The Great wrote the first human rights law in mankind history...  and so...  Five historical errors in the new film  The first problem is the title. Which ""Empire"" is supposed to be on the rise here? The ""Athenian Empire""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!? That didn't NEVER begin to rise ....  The movie gets under way with a wondrously unhistorical arrow. It is fired by Athenian hero Themistocles on the battlefield of Marathon near Athens in 490 BC, and it kills none other than Persian Great King Darius I, next to whom is standing son and successor Xerxes. Although Darius had launched the Persian expedition that came to grief at Marathon, he was not present there, nor was Xerxes.  From the Persians' Marathon defeat, which - historically - accounts for their revenge expedition under Xerxes, the scene shifts to the Persians' fleet a whole decade later. The fleet is under the command of a Greek woman - Queen Artemisia of Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum), played by Eva Green. Artemisia was real enough, we learn from Herodotus, her contemporary and historian of the Greco-Persian Wars. She was indeed a Greek queen, who did fight for the Persians at Salamis. But far from being admiral-in-chief of the Persian navy, she contributed a mere handful of warships out of the total of 600 or so.  The film-makers included one rather prolonged, explicit heterosexual sex scene. Utterly and completely fantastically it is between enemies Themistocles and Artemisia in the interim between the battles of Artemisium (presented as a Greek defeat - actually it was a draw) and Salamis. All in the name of diplomacy, naturally.  The crowning, climactic historical absurdity is the notion that in order for Themistocles and his Athenians to win at Salamis they needed the help of the massive Spartan navy which turns up just in the nick of time, commanded by another Greek queen, Gorgo (widow of Leonidas, the hero of 300), played by Lena Headey. Actually, Sparta contributed a mere 16 warships to the Greek fleet of some 400 ships at Salamis, and like Artemisia's they made absolutely no difference to the outcome, which was resoundingly and incontestably an Athenian victory.",7,2,Arian Irani,2zqy21Z29ps,0.08158761528326747,2014-03-10 21:16:11,False,True

2014-03-10T21:49:50,"Persians came twice to Conquer Greece and Failed once at Marathon under Darius I and the second time under Xerxes in what is called the Greatest Defeat of all time 10 yrs later (1st time your history teach got it wrong) (Herodotus wasn't wrong either he used Persian records and spoke to survivors from both sides) This was the First World War ever. Persia had conquered the known world, civilizations that were far in advanced of persia, Babylon(ex). They then attempted to conquer what is now called Greece(Hellas) with treaties with Carthage to make sure the Greeks from Sicily and Calabria(Magna Graecia) would not come to it's aid. In plain words the whole Mediterranean Region was involved. It took them 10 yrs to set it up, built roads, supply lines. 1 million or more army, two pontoon Bridges across the Bosporus Strait, 1500 ships that could carry 250 or more men, 200 supply ships, the persian LOST, at Salamis, and I yr later a Mycale(Sea) and Plataea(land). They never returned again,they were defeated by 30,000 United Greeks. That's Greek history. By the way Persia started in 550 BC, Greece was around and colonizing the Aegean & Ionian coastline for 600 yrs prior the first persian even seeing the Mediterranean Sea. They did it by sailing ,by trade, advancing their culture to a cultureless areas not conquering. Now as to your question would have Greece or the World been better off if the Persians had Won. Of course not. There never would have been a democracy. Has one come about anywhere in the World without it’s basic knowledge of Greece. Has one come to the Middle East even with it's knowledge. Has a Ruler ever been good in those locations or for the most part anywhere else. NO! Have empires been cruel, certainly everyone has.. Even the Romans came to Athens to learn of it. It was the base of its Republic Democracy. How did the Republic of Rome fair after the Caesars took over? If it hadn't been for Cincinnatus do you think George Washington would have stepped down? Napolieon  when asked why he tried his comeback, his response was ""Who do you think I am George Washington"". Without Greece that would have never Happened. As to slaves and the conquest of 'Might makes right', the Persians lived by it they just came upon a Mightier Foe.  That’s exactly how the Persians Ruled and Conquered. By the way Darius 1 slaughtered castrated 1000's boys and girls of the Revolting Ionian City States and he enslaved the woman using the boys a eunuchs and the woman/ girls as concubines. Xerxes did the same to Babylon and Egypt. You see my facts are better then your flawed theory. As to a weaken Greece because of it's civil war and Philip and then Alexander conquering what remained. Well at least he was Greek and then he Destroyed Persia. It's Called Revenge. Greeks don't take to others directing them or taking away their Freedom.

2014-03-11T23:20:56,"Stop this crazy Hollywood led Iran phobia:  300- the cartoonish film retelling of the Spartans' defence of Thermopylae against a Persian horde - now has a sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire. How much of it plays fast and loose with the history, asks Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek culture at Cambridge University.      1. The first problem is the title. Which ""Empire"" is supposed to be on the rise here? The ""Athenian Empire""? That didn't even begin to rise until at least two years after the events that the movie focuses on - the sea-battles of Artemisium and Salamis, both fought in 480 BC.     2. The movie gets under way with a wondrously unhistorical arrow. It is fired by Athenian hero Themistocles on the battlefield of Marathon near Athens in 490 BC, and it kills none other than Persian Great King Darius I, next to whom is standing son and successor Xerxes. Although Darius had launched the Persian expedition that came to grief at Marathon, he was not present there, nor was Xerxes.     3. From the Persians' Marathon defeat, which - historically - accounts for their revenge expedition under Xerxes, the scene shifts to the Persians' fleet a whole decade later. The fleet is under the command of a Greek woman - Queen Artemisia of Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum), played by Eva Green. Artemisia was real enough, we learn from Herodotus, her contemporary and historian of the Greco-Persian Wars. She was indeed a Greek queen, who did fight for the Persians at Salamis. But far from being admiral-in-chief of the Persian navy, she contributed a mere handful of warships out of the total of 600 or so.     4. The film-makers included one rather prolonged, explicit heterosexual sex scene. Utterly and completely fantastically it is between enemies Themistocles and Artemisia in the interim between the battles of Artemisium (presented as a Greek defeat - actually it was a draw) and Salamis. All in the name of diplomacy, naturally.     5. The crowning, climactic historical absurdity is the notion that in order for Themistocles and his Athenians to win at Salamis they needed the help of the massive Spartan navy which turns up just in the nick of time, commanded by another Greek queen, Gorgo (widow of Leonidas, the hero of 300), played by Lena Headey. Actually, Sparta contributed a mere 16 warships to the Greek fleet of some 400 ships at Salamis, and like Artemisia's they made absolutely no difference to the outcome, which was resoundingly and incontestably an Athenian victory.",1,0,mech som,2zqy21Z29ps,0.00038798920377867827,2014-03-11 23:20:56,False,True

And it is interesting that Americans who had the same shameful history of slavery are telling this story. Actually Persian were the first nation to ban the slavery and the capital of Persian Empire, Persepolis, was built by free and paid men and women. They even had some kind of maternity leave and unemployment insurance for the workers. Please read the history of Persepolis and Persia. By the way, Xerxes burnt Athene because the Athenian burnt Saradis, a city of Persian Empire, before and it was a revenge of that. Persian never used the color black and Persepolis was not in desert. The american media is preparing the minds of people for another war. They say that this movie is just about entertainment and not history, but they actually are fooling people, they lie. They need the people to have just a little negative idea about Persia and so no one would care if they would invade Iran and destroy the whole ancient Persia.

2014-03-12T07:45:31," I have always respected Greeks because of their services and great works in science, literature and philosophy.  I understand the fact that we (Persians) were the invaders and Greeks were defending their homeland but there are many things wrong with this sequel.   It portrays us like demons. In the previous movie, in the scene that one of Persian immortals' mask was removed, he looked like an Orc form The Lord of the Rings. Persians had the most advance empire at that time. They were not savage. Many minorities had religious freedom under their rule.   I'm not trying to justify the attack on Greece but they had burnt Sardis in minor Asia (which was in the Persian empire territory). That's why Xerxes ordered his soldiers to burn down Athens. (again I don't think that was such a brilliant idea neither).  No offence to colour people but Xerxes wasn't a black man. He had full beard and didn't have his nipples ringed.   The Persian army didn't posses around 1-2 million men.Roughly 200,000. Historians have always questioned it. How can this be logistically possible? (Considering the amount of supplies they needed). My whole point is, it would have been nice to have a neutral point of view in the movie. If Iran currently has political issues with West, it doesn't mean that its rich history and culture must be sacrificed. ",0,0,Xerxes,2zqy21Z29ps,0.16868055555555556,2014-03-12 07:45:31,False,True

First, the slow-mo stuff. I think there was a little too much in the movie. Second, the cgi or whatever. I didn't like it because it looked so...fake. It's tough to describe. I just didn't like how it looked. Lastly, and this is the one that REALLY bothered me the most, the scene where Themistokles and Artemisia get rather intimate. Sure it was funny to some extent, but I just felt like it didn't need to be there. As a matter of fact, that scene kinda ruined the movie for me. Now, don't get me wrong. This movie is bloody and everybody gets sliced in very intense sword fights. Several of the fights that Themistokles takes in are absolutely awesome to watch.

2014-03-25T12:24:39,I didn't get the same feeling with Themistocles as I had with Leonidas on the first 300. Leonidas had more passion & conviction. I didn't really connect with Themistocles' character. It's probably because they didn't show anything about his personal life. The fight scenes were okay but unrealistic at times especially with that horse on the ship. The fight scenes were equally bloody but the first 300 was more realistic. Good movie overall.

I mean in my opinion, this film is equal in quality to the first film, in which I find it to be a pretty solid in the story it wants to tell.  Like the first 300 film, this film does have a simple premise (and I do NOT care for historical accuracy). The first 300 film has the simple idea of freedom being worth fighting for and worth dying for. While this film does expand on that idea, it also has the premise of hell has no fury, so unite to accomplish wonders. But also like the first 300 movie, this film also uses the storytelling technique of the first film in which it told through the perspective of another person and as I notice whenever someone tells the story of anything (whether it is true or not) tends to exaggerate the details and make it come off as more melodramatic, thus I am able to swallow some of the more fantastical and over the top moments in the film. Also the fact that this film has a somewhat unqiue structure to other films I have seen, as it is not just a mere sequel to the first film and more like a companion piece (it is a prequel and a sequel, while also taking place at the same time as the first film).  Also I liked that the Athenians have a different motivation and goal to that of the Spartas, which shows that the filmmakers at least tried when it comes to the characters. Also Eva Green was FANTASTIC in the role and was hands down the best thing about this film,  Overall, this is a film that I will defiantly buy on Blu Ray when it comes out.",0,2,iamsuperbatman1993,2zqy21Z29ps,0.16505255255255255,2014-04-05 17:10:12,False,True

2014-04-20T14:45:12,"The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization  v=r0T78tNS9u8 It was perhaps the most spectacular flourishing of imagination and achievement in recorded history. In the Fourth and Fifth Centuries BC, the Greeks built an empire that stretched across the Mediterranean from Asia to Spain. They laid the foundations of modern science, politics, warfare and philosophy, and produced some of the most breathtaking art and architecture the world has ever seen. This series, narrated by Liam Neeson, recounts the rise, glory, demise and legacy of the empire that marked the dawn of Western civilization. The story of this astonishing civilization is told through the lives of heroes of ancient Greece. The latest advances in computer and television technology rebuild the Acropolis, recreate the Battle of Marathon and restore the grandeur of the Academy, where Socrates, Plato and Aristotle forged the foundation of Western though. The series combines dramatic storytelling, stunning imagery, new research and distinguished scholarship to render classical Greece gloriously alive. Empire of Mind The final segment describes how Athens, at the height of her glory, engaged in a suicidal conflict with her greatest rival, Sparta. Through the eyes of Socrates, Athens' first philosopher, viewers see the tragic descent of Athenian democracy into mob rule.The episode opens in 399 B.C., after the great philosopher Socrates has been sentenced to death and Athens lies in ruins after a war with Sparta. This episode goes back to 431 B.C., to an Athens at the height of its cultural, political, and economic power. Having taken great leaps forward in every field of learning, and with a strong economy that dominates Mediterranean trade, Athens and its 150,000 residents are the envy of their neighbors, in particular, bellicose Sparta. Jealous of Athenian success, the Spartans yearn to spill Athenian blood and dominate the region. Of course, Pericles knows what is coming, and he orders the citizens to abandon open areas and take refuge inside the walls of Athens. The mighty Athenian fleet will provide supplies for the citizens through the port of Piraeus and a walled corridor between that city and Athens. Over time, the navy will prevail, as it had against the Persians, and win yet another victory. Much is at stake -- democracy, freedom, the whole Athenian way of life. As expected, the Spartans invade and burn the open areas around the city. But it is the unexpected that deals the most devastating blow to Athens. Incoming ships with supplies for the walled-in Greeks carry plague-bearing rats feeding on grain. The disease ravages the Athenians, inflicting agony on them and killing one out of every three. The Spartans are of little concern; what matters is surviving until tomorrow. Pericles' esteem plummets even as he himself contracts the plague and eventually dies. Finally in 404 B.C., Athens surrenders. The Athenians, shattered and stripped of their empire, take revenge on their most vocal critic and condemn Socrates to death before a people's court.",0,0,Boukephalos1,2zqy21Z29ps,0.1980802341597796,2014-04-20 14:45:12,False,True

2014-06-08T02:02:43," the Arab Muslim armies pushed forward toward the Persian capital of Ctesiphon (also called Madā'in in Arabic), which was quickly evacuated by Yazdgird after a brief siege. After seizing the city, they continued their drive eastwards, following Yazdgird and his remaining troops. Within a short span of time, the Arab armies defeated a major Sassanid counter-attack in the Battle of Jalūlā', as well as other engagements at Qasr-e Shirin, and Masabadhan. By the mid-7th Century, the Arabs controlled all of Mesopotamia, including the area that is now the Iranian province of Khuzestan. It is said that Caliph Umar did not wish to send his troops through the Zagros mountains and onto the Iranian plateau. One tradition has it that he wished for a ""wall of fire"" to keep the Arabs and Persians apart. Later commentators explain this as a common-sense precaution against over-extension of his forces. The Arabs had only recently conquered large territories that still had to be garrisoned and administered. The continued existence of the Persian government was however an incitement to revolt in the conquered territories and unlike the Byzantine army, the Sassanid army was continuously striving to regain their lost territories. Finally Umar decided to push his forces for further conquests, which eventually resulted in the whole scale conquest of the Sassanid Empire. Yazdegerd, the Sassanid king, made yet another effort to regroup and defeat the invaders. By 641 he had raised a new force, which took a stand at the Battle of Nihawānd, some forty miles south of Hamadan in modern Iran. The Rashidun army under the command of Umar's appointed general Nu'man ibn Muqarrin al-Muzani, attacked and again defeated the Persian forces. The Muslims proclaimed it the Victory of victories (Fath alfotuh) as it marked the End of the Sassanids, shattering the last strongest Sassanid army.",0,0,Mourad Ber,2zqy21Z29ps,0.06508237133237134,2014-06-08 02:02:43,False,False

Marathon 192 Athenian Died, 10-12000 persans  killed. The persians sailed away to escape death around Marathon only to find themselves facing the same Greeks they fought 26 miles away at the Athenian Harbor, waiting persians turned and i-ran away. The general was Killed by Darius I. 10 yrs later persia invaded again with 1 million or more killed 300 Spartans and several hundred other Greeks at Thermopylae but lost 20,000+ in doing so in 3 days. Then they burn an an evacuated city killing any who remained, burning down Greek Religious Temples, and Athens, murdering the Greek priests that remained, so much for persians religious tolerance you  trolling iranians are always ranting about,empty poor lies. persians did the same to Babylonians and Egyptians. Then comes the Battle of Salamis, devastating finally blow to xerxes seeing most of his ships destroyed right in front of him. It reminded him of Thermopylae and how the Spartans had destroyed his immortals with ease. He i-ran away back to persia to save his skin. Finally 1 yr later at Plataea led by Spartan King, Pausanias  routed, killed 300,000 persian dead or enslaved, the ones running away to the pontoon bridges were cut down by Alexander the I. persia never came back again out of FEAR. 478 Sestus. Taken by the Athenians. Beginning of the Athenian Empire So you see it wasn’t painful for the Greeks at all. I just love it when you Lie. I get to retell a brief synopsis of Greek History. You must Love it too you foolishly do it so often to  HUMILIATE YOURSELF and nationality or as I come to suspect you wish you were Greek. Alas I can’t help you there.

Foul, racist American propaganda painting the great and enlightened Persian empire as a bunch of savages. The ""suicide bomber"" was particularly sickening.  Spot on with this comment. This is an example of a film that should never make it past the drawing board. (another pretty close feeling to what I had watching it). Ugh! Down right awful! (short but to the point). If they changed eva green's character to a male character and tweaked the story i mean a lot it would have a shot. (this is closest though to how I really felt).  In what world are people stupid enough to watch these chicks lead armies fighting with the men.  At on point the queen raises a sword, and all it's missing is her screaming VAGINA POWER!! with like a rainbow or something, that's the only way I could have thought to make this movie any worse and honestly it may have made me laugh so that could have even been an improvement.   The only thing I'll take away from this movie other then my head hung low, will be to know that if I ever lead a country that's a huge world power with 10's of thousands of ships maybe I shouldn't let an 80 pound slave ship slut have complete control of them.   It a strange situation to be at the end of a movie hoping that the guy beats the girls azz in moral combat.  I'd say more but I feel I've put a lot more effort into this comment then the movie was worth.",4,0,mystik whitewolf,2zqy21Z29ps,0.0020502645502645613,2014-09-22 09:17:34,False,False

Even if you are Persian today, there's no need to get so upset when they're simply changing events that happened thousands of years ago, because honestly there are a crap tonne of good films that like to unrealistically vilify other countries still around today.
