Sure, I know Swedes and Scandis are involved, but still. I don‚Äôt like it. I don‚Äôt know. I mean sure, midsommar is an old  holiday. I assume it would be considered pagan. But still. It traditionally celebrates the summer solstice and everything coming back to life after the winter. I am pretty sure this is kind of how people of non western decent feel when their traditional jewellery and clothing is copied cheaply and worn as a costume, or when parts of their traditions and religion becomes a trendy fashion or fun past time. (Swedes have never been oppressed in the same way as certain other groups, and I understand  things like that might bear more significance than, but I feel like I can understand and with this relate on a very basic level) It‚Äôs not great.

You can tell early on this is more of an attempt at art than trying to score cheap thrills. Is it ""scary"" in the traditional sense? No. But its not meant to terrify you with jump scares and such. It's smarter than that. It will likely continue processing in your brain well after you leave the theater. Cinematography and visuals is fantastic. The acting isn't Oscar-worthy, but more than acceptable. There are some gruesome scenes that are tough to watch and a few others that are sick and twisted with dark humor sprinkled in. It's an intense movie but its not like a fast roller coaster ride. This movie is a slow burn. It is long. Is it worth going to see? Yes I think so.

A story about feelings everyone will face once or twice in a lifetime, about experiences that could destroy us or strengthen us.

If you haven't watched this film yet, be warned. Ari Aster is a master of sound manipulation and directorial shots in a mad scientist way of literally putting you INTO the fear of his films.  It's not what you're watching that's scary, it's what you're feeling that's scary, and that's something that I've never seen done in a horror film before.  If something bad has happened (or is going to happen), then you only have one of two directions to go because you're not going anywhere.   1. You'll understand what's happening while the actor does. Your heart will race because even if you knew what was about to happen, you're now trapped in it,  you can't stop it, and you can't stop yourself from witnessing it.   2. You think you know what's going to happen, but once you realize it when the actor does, you're still completely lost for any sort of logical help or saving grace just as they are.

I was thinking ""this movie is dumb""--- but having had my fair share of trips, I thought it was at least interesting  enough to watch  to see what their trip was going to be like . Then the movie got weird... & I think the point of the sheer horrid-ness of the film was whether or not the beauty of the surroundings and in the countryside could make up for the corruption within the village; and I think the filmmaker wanted the viewer to ask himself that...... ""Do I focus on the beauty of the natural world or the ugliness of humanity?"" .  It wasn't a good film, it wasn't a bad film.

This movie is not something you see more than once (unless you are a little bit of a  psychopath), this movie made me sick to my stomach and I couldn't sleep for days.

2020-05-31T15:08:41,"It took me too long to realize, but this movie actually makes fair sense and is pretty damn good. The whole movie presents the idea that Christian is the ""bad boyfriend"" or at least someone the audience wouldn't be pleased with. Yet by the end, we see Christian having gone through horrifying experiences of his own almost as if atoning for his negligent attitude towards his role in helping Dani to heal, and even though Dani's presence there was indirectly the reason that all happens to him - even though Christian STILL never had the heart to leave her on her own, he couldn't have been so cruel - Dani makes the shockingly cruel decision to allow him to be taken by the cultists. By doing this, she ends up affording herself the emotional resolve she was in need of. So the movie essentially was about this: Dani cured her emotional trauma, she got Christians help to do so... Christian was mildly cruel to her because his relationship to her caused him mild pain. Dani, at the very end, was extremely cruel to him because her own suffering (part of which from not being supported by Christian well enough) caused her to feel extreme pain.  Dani, the one the audience sympathizes with through the WHOLE movie, is revealed as the true villain. Christian cared about her pain enough not to leave her, although he still could have been more supportive. Dani cared so much about her pain that she kills Christian in order to heal from it when all she had to do was say, ""No, don't kill him. He doesn't deserve to die like that.""  But she did want him to die, even though he didn't deserve to.  What I like best about this is how it challenges the viewers idea of villainy. The classic take of a villain usually provides a lot of pain and suffering through the villains upbringing and leads them to want to ""share their pain"" in a twisted act of selfish justice. This is what we see of Dani. She isn't a villain at all, seemingly. She is a poor hurting girl who needs help and support. She has been through cruelty and is feeling misunderstood. All of this works to build up the idea that Dani deserves emotional resolve and Christian is supposed to help her. Think of the following analogy: a parent (Christian) intends to FEED (emotionally support) their kid (Dani) to prevent them from STARVING (committing suicide) but the parent is kinda failing. One day, the parent gets duped, drugged, raped, and paralyzed, meanwhile the kid is at home going hungry. The parent returns home, broken in mind body and spirit, empty handed before the kid. The kid, in need of food and seeing that the parent has failed to perform the duty of feeding them, chooses to have the parent fed to them in order to deal with the hunger...  Yeah, Dani is that bad. She is a maniacally selfish villain by the end of the movie due to the pain of her past. This is an inversion of the traditional method of presenting a villain in the movie to later reveal their tragic backstory which makes you sympathize with them more. Dani's tragedy is revealed immediately and makes us sympathize with her as the victim protagonist... until the very end where we see her evolve into the villain; taking vengeance on Christian to help herself. The bottom line in this: Christian should have left her, but he didn't, he thought that was too cruel. Dani should NOT have killed him, but she did, she didn't think it wasn't fair for her. Christian leaving her probably would have indirectly resulted in her losing her life to suicide, which Christian would have felt extreme pain over. Dani staying with him directly resulted in him being traumatized and killed, which Dani felt no remorse for.   This is the story of how Dani, the protagonist, was formed into the villain through trials of suffering. That's what a ""bad guy"" is, usually; a hurt person. I think this film really is a masterpiece, but there are some parts to scenes I disagree with. The idea is better than the process of the story.",5,1,lucabaar1,1Vnghdsjmd0,-0.04999999999999999,2020-05-31 15:08:41,False,False
