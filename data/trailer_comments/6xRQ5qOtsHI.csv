2018-04-28T13:12:03,"BIG SPOILER! V V V The crew let the snow leopard mother die. Seemed like her two young ones probably died as well. That is not clear. It seemed the crew may have had some some subtle influence on events, and I think they might have had some responsibility for what happened. Certainly they stood by while the cat died, and then showed the corpse on the screen. If the cat couldn't hunt anymore, babies weren't going to survive. The snow leopard is in decline; these might have been captured and released or even placed in a (good) animal park. Beats starving to death. You have an opportunity to help, help.",0,0,Brendan McManus,6xRQ5qOtsHI,0.10515873015873016,2018-04-28 13:12:03,False,False
