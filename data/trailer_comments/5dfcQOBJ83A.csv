Hate the way they had Mitch's fiance die but that is pretty minor in the scheme of things.  Dylan looks to be a good Mitch in the trailer.  I can't say for sure till I watch the movie.  In the books he is dark hair, dark skin, and able to grow a thick beard to fit in very well in the Middle East.  Dylan looks like that?  Plus frame-wise he isn't really imposing which also fits the books.  It's his attitude and abilities that are somewhat larger than life and make him a badass.

The only difference is the dark features that Dylan has that can be altered with blue contact lenses and a little blonde in his hair, but not a necessity since Paul has been dark featured in parts of the movie, but why can't someone else seem to see this as an awesome idea and I have spent my entire life, thinking there will never be another Paul Walker, until I came across former Stiles from Teen Wolf, all grown up and jaw droppingly beautiful in every sense of the word, from the acting that can't be touched by anyone his age and he could be great in the furious sequels, his career is going to be the best thing to hit Hollywood movies in a an all new generation from, mine and Paul Walker's.",116,6,Tina Clayton,5dfcQOBJ83A,0.17980205278592376,2017-04-19 08:46:28,True,True

Dylan O'Brien is a skinny athletic kid. Rapp is someone that looks like Tom Hardy. Dylan O'Brien weighs like 150 to 160 pounds even if he hit the gym for this role.  c) Shocker they have to turn a white character in a book into a minority because ""PC""  Instead of trying to fit in a young guy who the girls like as Mitch Rapp, how about you pick someone that the ACTUAL Mitch Rapp fans could envision being Mitch Rapp. You couldn't find a B-list actor who actually looks intimidating on the screen?  Sullivan Stapleton would be perfect if they were to do a movie based on the middle of the pack novels, but obviously it is really hard to do so. Even though he does have an Australian accent his size is exactly what Mitch Rapp looks like. If O'Brien can put on 20 pounds of muscle if there becomes a 2nd film then okay, but I doubt he can because his Hollywood vision is more of the soccer player like appearance not the NFL strong safety that Mitch Rapp is suppose to look like.",0,0,Nolan Hughes,5dfcQOBJ83A,0.18251488095238091,2017-04-24 00:31:02,True,True
2017-04-24T00:58:55,"Obviously this movie was created for people (mostly the girls) who have never read or even heard of Mitch Rapp. This is a disgrace to Vince Flynn (RIP) and his legacy. A kid that is at least 20 pounds lighter than the real Mitch Rapp and is kind of a softy in his major roles. I saw the Maze Runner once and he seemed like a whiny little girl who simply becomes a leader but was too nice of a guy. Mitch Rapp is just the opposite. The issue with waiting this long to produce this movie is that most of the people that fit the Mitch Rapp overall appearance are at least 30 years old. There really aren't many American actors under the age of 28 who are about 185 to 195 pounds and well built. And the issue is, most of the guys that do actually fit this appearance tend to look more like Hollister models than someone that you'd expect to be a CIA assassin. Chris Hemsworth is too old by probably 4yrs, Tom Hardy & Sullivan Stapleton are both too old but perfect build and also both have strong accents, his brother may be a little tall but a hell lot more realistic to being a CIA assassin than Dylan O'Brien.  There are NO good actors for this role under the age of 33. Any actor that fits the appearance expectations of Mitch Rapp would be the Mitch Rapp in the first book that Flynn produced (which is the 3rd book when it comes in actual storyline order). So unfortunately they're settling for an actor that gives the real fans no chance at ever seeing a realistic Mitch Rapp unless the American Assassin movie is part 1 and if they do any other movies then they jump the script by the realistic 6 years and have a whole new cast that fits the part.",0,0,Nolan Hughes,5dfcQOBJ83A,0.15810236511456027,2017-04-24 00:58:55,True,True
