I really wanted to see him act with his wife character in this movie.

So the only comment that needs to be said here is if you are going to see it or not or if you think it would be good or not. This is not the time for you to point out racism or education or who is better and who is not. Stop trying to bring other issues into everything and focus on the contents giving.

2019-07-04T21:25:39,"For those who have seen this Movie you can definitely agree with me that it ended really bad for Cedric for 3 Reasons. 1. He is now single because Gail cheated on him with Drake, 2. He is now 36-40 Thousand Dollars in Debt due to the Miscommunication of the Pricing of the Constantine Villa and 3. He lost 100 Grand to Bennett (He should've held onto that Dollar). Hopefully something goes right for him in the 3rd Movie (if that happens) !!!",0,0,Ryder Benson,N8b6kVSZNLE,-0.01581632653061222,2019-07-04 21:25:39,False,False
