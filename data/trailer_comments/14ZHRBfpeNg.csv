You could use accents from typical asians OUTSIDE of South East Asia and NOBODY would notice. Funny how they complain about authenticity when they can't spreak proper Singlish. And who cares whether there are other races or not, it's their fucking story. If you want, go make your own movie with all races. Is P.Ramlee racist for not putting other races in his story even when there are other races?? Is Jack Neo racist for lack of racial variety in his movies?? I mean, it's really up to them AS LONG AS they don't stereotypes our ethnicity or culture as a negative one or claim Indian or Malay culture as theirs in the name of being ""Singaporean"". Well, knowing sensitive blockheads in Singapore, even if you have other races, you might still get bashed for cultural appropriation. Don't like don't support loh. But I would never agree using that movie as a representation for the asians let alone the South East ones and by that comparing to Black Panther wouldn't make sense. Most of the cast are black bc they have to, if Black Panther casts was white, you guys have nothing to be proud of lel sad huh. Every movie have context and roles to play.

Here's why it paid off for me not reading the book years ago, after I finished reading the second book I only had maybe a week to wait for the 3rd book, Rich People Problems; to be released. Let me tell you that was perfect timing because I couldn't stand waiting that one week to read the final book! So it was perfect in the sense that I didn't have to wait months or a year to read that last book. I throughly enjoyed all three, loved the good characters and enjoyed hating the underhanded characters. After reading about them on pages then to see them all on screen will be amazing.
