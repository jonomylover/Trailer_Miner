I'm sorry, but techno in the WARCRAFT trailer? Are you fucking kidding. the franchise renowned for Arthas' theme, and the opening screen orcish war drums in WoW, those masterpieces, and you're gonna use this? the whole point of Warcraft is how its theme and setting has adapted and become more complex over time; it started out as a standard point and click game from way back when, turned into the more lore focused Warcraft 3, and as wow has evolved, the lore and setting and music has become more complex and intricate, although the last couple expansions where a bit lacking. But this, this is like adding Beethoven to Call of Duty. was this decision made because gamers are stereotypically into electronic music and Warcraft is a game franchise? That's like saying alcoholics use orange juice in drinks, so all you're gonna advertise at bars is Sunny D. I'm sorry but panning over the beautifully shot Dwarven leaders, that well crafted shot really created atmosphere for me; but I lost it when you started playing fucking Skrillex.

I will not say that humor alone would sell a good Movie, but Warcraft IS funny, and the producers make it too serious. Plus: where are all the Races the Warcraft Universe includes? The games had a colourful cast of fantasycreatures and Monsters, like trolls, tauren, elves, gnomes, some fucking Pandamen, and what does this have? Just humans and Orcs, and a few dwarfs, not a lot if you asked me...

But come on, if you ""sell"" the movie in a tone so different to what it is, what you're basically doing is lying to the customer, who will then get disappointed and shit all over your film online.  The music of warcraft MADE warcraft. Why not work with those who made it in the first place, and get them some help from some hollywood hotshot?  Where's the amazing warcraft music we're used to hear in every game trailer? It's missing so much. No trailer showed anything remotely similar to the mood of actual warcraft.

2016-04-20T21:42:08,"This movie started out with promise; and a lot of it.  But instead of even trying to make a a good video game movie, they're just going to turn it into a popcorn flick.  The marketing has been so unfaithful to the very concept of Warcraft, and it's unbelievable that Blizzard superfans allow them to approve this.  The CGI is so mediocre; and don't give me that ""There's *SSOOOoooOoOOO* much CGI, how do you expect it all to look good?"". I expect it to look good because this movie is funded by a AAA game company and Legendary Studios.  They have as much of a budget as Disney, and if you've seen the new Jungle Book, you'd know that it's not the hard to make a lot of CGI look good with the amount of money they're spending on this.    The music for the trailer was horrible.  I get it, they have to market it to a large crowd; but high-octane, orchestral battle music from Warcraft is 10x more captivating.  It's not a modern action movie, for fuck's sake.  And I'm not even going to talk about the posters.

And it's kind of disrespectful to the fans imo if you really look at it. Activision-Blizzard is one of the most popular game companies that is worth 20 billion dollars today. This company probably has the most loyal  consumers as well. I mean all their stuff is great imo, But you can't deny the fact that they do some ho shit. For example, having a subscription for world of Warcraft for so long when other mmos that were more detailed and dynamic didn't... Not selling heroes of the storm as a full game but making you buy the characters individually which adds up to more than $100 and they are still adding more (or you can grind a century and a half to get them)... Overwatch for $60 when fps-wise its kind of below average in graphic in detail but I bet gameplay is great. And oh boy on the Activision side... Rehash after rehash of cod after cod. They release DLC and do micro-transactions that are nothing but vanity and don't improve gameplay.   SO WITH ALL THAT SAID... I THINK THE LEAST THEY CAN DO IS FUND THE MOVIE MORE OR SOME SHIT FOR BETTER CGI. BUT NOPE IT SEEMS THEY ARE GOING TO RELY ON THEIR FANS WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SETTLING. THE HUNTSMAN WHICH CAME OUT THIS WEEKEND HAD A BUDGET OF 170 MILLION AND THEY USED IT WELL. EXCELLENT CGI AND CHOREOGRAPHY. WARCRAFT MOVIE HAD A BUDGET OF 100 MILLION. AND FROM THE TRAILERS I CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE OF 70 MILLION ALREADY. AND IT'S CRAZY BECAUSE WARCRAFT IS WHAT GOT BLIZZARD WHERE IT IS TODAY.

Hence, the reason why a lot of gamers would even still enjoy dubstep.  In fact, the marketing department doesn't even seem to know too much past the generalized statistical-based research because they have not considered how the fan base for generic first person shooters is large and casual to the point where they are actually pretty distant from the flip side (or true side, in my perspective) of the gamer community.",5,7,Supermagicaldeadguy,65AjY_nRdqE,0.05178571428571428,2016-05-01 07:21:29,True,True

2016-05-25T12:55:41,"I just watched it and this is my personal rating, The movie is a fucking 5/5!!  disclaimer: I'm a bit biased because I'm a fan of the Warcraft games in general especially the RTS. Warcraft 1 was one of my first RTS that I played along with C&C and that's way back in 1995. Anyway I'll just list the it's pros and cons of the movie.  Pros: + They nailed the look of the movie, especially the ORCs. It just looks and feels like Warcraft. + CGI is amazing, definitely one of the best by ILM. The facial expressions of the Orcs are just awesome to look at, it might rival Avatar in that department. +  The  ingame locations, stormwind, dalaran. Seeing it in the big screen is a joy to us Warcraft fans. (Although some locations are not accurate like Dalaran is not supposed to float not until Archimonde sieged it during the events of WC3) + Dialogue is good enough, dont expect some LotR narrative. + Lothar is just awesome, hopefully we will see more of Travis Fimmel in the big screen.Overall most of the actors did well even the CGI orcs Durotan, Ogrim,  Guldan etc. + It's action packed no dull moments for me. + Magics are represented well in this movie, theres incantations and  magic circle.  If you are a mage in World of Warcraft you prolly had  orgasmed after seeing it lol. + There are some shots later on when the cameras are overhead and it looked like a warcraft RTS game. + This movie gave me feels than that specific BvS scene.    Cons - Some plotpoints might be confusing because the movie is just only 2HRs, the movie pacing is quite fast. - Not adding some familiar game music is a missed opportunity.  - Dwarves are CGI - Battles are quite short I expected more :D  The movie ending is open for a sequel, there's a few surprises don't expect that this movie will have a fairy tale ending.  I think the movie will hold itself well to those who are not familiar with the source material. I just hope that the movie will do well in the box office, it needs its returns for future sequel/s. The Warcraft lore is just vast and it will be a shame if this first movie will be the last. Just go ahead have an open mind and watch it, Ignore the critics. Your opinion is what matter most. The movie entertained me than most recent superhero movie releases. Hopefully the Assassins creed movie will do well, we need more good videogame movies.",0,0,Devilrose,65AjY_nRdqE,0.19491666666666663,2016-05-25 12:55:41,True,True
