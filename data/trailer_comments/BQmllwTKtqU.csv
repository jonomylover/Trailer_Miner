2015-07-13T05:05:21,"It is a true story, and at 76 I am an old person. I spent all of my summers in a cottage, on Chatham Harbor just down the road from USCG Station Chatham, from 1947 to 1961. I sailed in those waters and often went out into the Atlantic. But I wouldn't get anywhere near the Chatham Bar when Small Craft Warnings (sustained winds, over coastal waters, with speeds of 23–38 mph, indicated by a red pendant) were flying. That Bernie Webber and 3 other Coasties took something as small as the CG36500 with a finicky engine and minimal navigation equipment most of which was smashed by the waves (restored and now maintained by the Orleans, Mass Historical Society) across the bar in 60 foot seas and hurricane force winds took a degree of courage that I venture no poster (particularly the ones making the snide remarks) could muster. And I included myself.  And they rescued 32 of the 33 crew members of the Pendleton (the 33rd fell from the Jacobs Ladder and was swept away). If you have ever seen the CG36500, and I have from when it was in service in the 1950s at the Chatham Fish Pier and as restored in 2012, you could justifiably wonder where the 36 men most, wearing bulky kapok life jackets, were ""stowed."" Ironically, In fact, I once was swamped in a small sailboat by the wake of the 36500 or the 36501 also based in Chatham. I don't know if Webber was at the helm that day. Webber and the crew were awarded the USCG's highest honor for heroic action for the rescue. And the USCG named the first of its new Sentinel Class Cutters, all of which are or will be named after heroic enlisted Coasties, the ""Bernard C. Webber."" BTW the Pendleton and the Fort Mercer, another T-2 that broke in two in the same storm, were not well designed modern tankers but relics from WWII which were designed, like Liberty Ships, to be built fast for the war effort without much regard for their longevity. Remember many of them didn't make it through the war courtesy of the U-Boats. And if you don't like the title of the movie, don't complain about Disney but complain to the authors because that is the title of the book. Better yet, read it or Teresa Barbo's ""The Pendleton Disaster off Cape Cod."" Or even better, get a copy of Bernie Webber's autobiography ""Chatham 'The Lifeboatmen.'""",434,20,Paul Galanti,BQmllwTKtqU,0.1656472128694351,2015-07-13 05:05:21,True,True

So... this might not be popcorn cinema for everyone. You should only watch it if you are interested in maritime movies, have at least a really basic technical and nautical understanding and come out without explosions and plot twists every five minutes... what shouldn't mean it's not action packed. My only critic is that there is no explanation of the situation in the beginning and you re like ""oh okay they seem to know what they should do because I fucking don't lol"". You might want to google the tankers position and curse by the beginning of the movie, or read further, (SPOILER) The tanker is heading down south and the coast is in their way to the right/west, 2-10 miles. they get dragged parallel to the coast, or something like that and try to head to a sandbank in front of another bank blocking the bay where the coast guard boat chills and that bank is dangerous for the boat.",1,0,III Vance,BQmllwTKtqU,0.0912777777777778,2016-11-12 17:05:42,False,False

2019-06-14T02:25:00,"I really liked the movie, I got it in DVD and have watched it several time, but, I think, there were some lack of key information to get connected with the story. First, some scene about the MV Landry's fail rescue where Bernie Webber was part of the rescue team (and where all Landry’s crew members died) in a similar storm, was essential to understand why Webber was so stubborn trying to find the oil tanker Pendleton. Second, state the real reason why the oil tanker (and others) used to split in two. (It was because the rush construction during WWII neglected the use of steel quality) and finally and not less important, the strong catholic Webber background that was the hidden driver force behind all his actions (his father was a priest and he also wanted him to be one). As a final note, I think, that the involvement of his wife during all the rescue stages was exaggerated and unnecessary (In reality, she had a flu, and was resting in her house unaware of what was happening). There were other facts that could help to understand better the plot. The main reason of the US coast guard existence was to support the maritime economic activity in the area at that time. (because the soil was depleted, and people from Chatham and closed area didn't have other option than look for the sea as a way of surviving). Then, there was a symbiotic relationship between the US coastguard and commercial sailors.",0,0,gladiator,BQmllwTKtqU,0.019135802469135803,2019-06-14 02:25:00,False,False
