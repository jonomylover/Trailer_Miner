With Freya's ability to freeze any enemy, the young Ice Queen has spent decades in a remote wintry palace raising a legion of deadly Huntsmen ‚Äì including Eric and warrior Sara ‚Äì only to find that her prized two defied her one demand: forever harden your hearts to love.  When Freya learns of her sister's demise, she summons her remaining soldiers to bring the Magic Mirror home to the only sorceress left who can harness its power. But once she resurrects Ravenna from the Mirror's golden depths, the wicked sister threaten this enchanted land with twice the darkness it's ever seen.

Eric was supposed to be in love with Snow now, so i guess that just because his wife turned out to be alive, he decided to give up on those feelings for Snow and go back to Sara. how incredibly inaccurate!! i strongly believe that this movie destroys everything the first movie was about, just because Kristen and Rupert did what they did.. such a waste..",0,0,Katerina Georganta,F2-_OQL9fBk,0.10070028011204481,2016-02-18 23:47:46,True,True

This movie is about the snow queen who's child dies so she wants to rid the world of love. That is by far the dumbest villain motivation I have heard in awhile. It doesn't even make any sense. The fact that this movie even got made doesn't even make any sense to me. The plot line is thin with nothing new. The characters are one dimensional and the romance they have with one another especially Chris Hemsworth and his love interest is a joke in the film. This movie also can't decide if it wants to be a prequel, sequel, or a reboot which is laughable at times. The ending has a plot twist which I won't spoil but it was the most predictable plot twist that I've probably seen from a movie in a couple of years. This movie is as bad as it gets and isn't even enjoyable to watch. I have seen almost every movie this year and even I enjoyed God's of Egypt more then this. At least I could laugh in that movie from how bad it was. Don't see this cause you'd be wasting your time with this movie. This movie has no redeeming qualities so I won't even try to look for one.

I feel that in the same vein of the first film, it should have maintained the the same dark theme and tone throughout. I also think that they focused too much on the visuals. Sure, visuals are good, but I feel that the story should be first and foremost in terms of the amount of attention received. The trailers make me think that the two sisters are going to combine their armies and attempt to take over the world. I also dislike how they completely wrote off Ravenna's brother. In my opinion, that was just plain laziness. And it wouldn't have even been that bad if they didn't contradict the fact that the brother admitted to Eric's wife, Sarah. In the film, they just rewrote all of that. It was like they didn't think it would effect the film as a whole. However, I find that plot holes really detract from the experience.
