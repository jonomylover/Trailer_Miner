2013-12-11T05:40:53,"I just watched this trailer just now, but I caught it being talked about on AMC movie news and they called this a Matrix clone. I liked the matrix and know the trilogy pretty well enough and seeing this I don't see that much similarity between this movie and The Matrix. Yeah it takes some loose blue print inspirations perhaps but it is not a clone of it.  It is a space science fiction movie. Yes it does revolve around Mila Kunis having a destiny and that she is a princess and that Channing Tatum is tasked to protect her. This movie revolves around Mila, and unlike Keanu, she has what it takes to be the sole driving force and the one that will carry this movie forward. She is talented enough.  Channing, to his credit, blends into the role that he has been task with and does so very admirably.  Here is to hoping that The Wachowski siblings don't force a romance subplot between the two co-stars. In fact I would be okay if Channing's character dies at the end protecting Jupiter in order to help her fulfilling he calling and destiny. (Keep in mind, that this is not spoiler, just my opinion through predicting)  And I am curious just how will the Siblings kill of Sean Beam in this movie since he is the token dead guy/the Hollywood red shirt that has to die in almost every single movie he is in.   I think that this will be a good movie.",0,0,Patrick Shutt,ZoCyL_Pqzu8,0.16885302197802193,2013-12-11 05:40:53,True,True

Nowhere in the trailer dies it say that the character played by Mila Kunis is 'the Princess of Jupiter' (I almost fell laughing when I read that comment). I think that mist of you really just have a limited amount of brain power to allocate to something as trivial as understanding what your looking at and listening to. The title is Jupiter Ascending cuz Mila Kunis's character is called Jupiter and ascending refers to her taking her rightful place in the Universe but also ascending from her insignificant life on Earth, a planet who's inhabitants aren't aware that they're are many civilized and advanced races out there so basically she ascends to a higher level, from ignorance to knowledge. As far as if its going to be any good well I stopped trusting the Wachowsky brother and sister to deliver solid sci fi. They did it once with the first Matrix and never could do it again. Science Fiction is one of the most difficult genre to do correctly. You can't just set a story in space or in the future and call it sci fi. First there needs to be a coherent and complete mythology in which the story will take place. There also needs to be some fundamental philosophical questions that are either directly tacked in the story or hinted at. As a avid sci fi fan and reader for the last 25 years I can say that of all the books and movies that call themselves sci fi maybe only 20% is really sci fi. Asimov achieved it with his Robot and Foundation Series, Frank Herbert achieve and redefined it with the Dune series. Aldous Huxley with A Brave New World, Philip José Farmer, Philip K Dick and Arthur C Clarke all wrote cladssic of the genre.",99,0,Louis-Alexandre Simard,ZoCyL_Pqzu8,0.22365134865134864,2014-03-19 14:27:46,True,True
