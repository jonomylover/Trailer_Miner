Why? Bring back theatrical traditional animation, Disney. I miss traditional animation. All Disney making CGI movies does these days is November and grossing a lot of money. Worse why Walt Disney Animation Studios movies were box offices successes has to go by 2010s CGI like Big Hero 6 and not WDAS in general like Bolt? Why bringing back successes has to be Tangled and not Bolt? Stupid 1995-present WDAS like Frozen. 1995-present WDAS like Tangled ruined Disney animated movies.

Since one of the species is known as a predator and the other prey, the prey don't trust the predator therefore adding a lack of trust. Sound familiar?

Are there¬†other Zootopias?¬†Is there¬†racism (speciesism?) between the¬†different species of mammals? Did these intelligent anthropomorphic animals commit genocide against each other? Does their history correspond with human history? If so then there surely would have been genocide.¬†Around¬†2the polar bear clearly does the Christian cross motion on¬†his body. Does this mean that the Christian faith or a variation exists? Do only polar bears follow this Christianity or do many of the other species or individual animals follow it? If so then what does their god look like? Is it a combination of every species of mammal!? Did humans ever exist? Is it set in¬†a¬†future where animals overthrew human society but used our society as a model for there own?

2016-02-19T12:28:18,"You people are insane. This looks amazing. It's creative, it's nicely animated, and I ALREADY enjoy the Dynamic between Judy and Nick.  Just because it has anthropomorphic animals, doesn't mean it's bad. Micky Mouse is an Anthropomorphic animal. Bugs Bunny is an Anthropomorphic animal. There are PLENTY of movies with Anthropomorphic animals.  If you hate animals, then, sure, I understand why you wouldn't like this film. But all the rest of you are just trying to piss off the furry community by hating on this film, because a portion of them watch porn. If this film came out way back in the day, you'd leave it alone, but right now it's like a trend to make fun of furries. Good for you, go pet yourself on the back.  ((Before anyone asks, I'm not a furry myself)).

As a Disney fan, I have noticed that Disney movies these days are reusing the concept of the ""good, cute innocent-looking fellow"" being the bad guy. Let's start with Lotso Huggin Bear; a cute, huggable strawberry-scented bear, who has plans on overthrowing innocent toys to the Caterpillar room and reigning over Sunnyside. King Candy; a comical and quirky, funny-looking king, who is actually Turbo and has plans to take over Sugar Rush, with the deletion of Vanellope's identity and death of Ralph. Hans; a handsome, regal-looking prince, who has plans on killing Anna and Elsa to reign over Arendelle. Professor Callaghan; a smart, wise-looking and compassionate professor, who has plans on killing Alistar Krei because of her daughter's (assumed) death, caused by Krei's project. And lastly, our newest addition to this ""villain line"" is Bellwether; a small, cute and adorable lamb/sheep, who has plans on taking over Zootopia by framing Lionheart's reputation by turning evolved predators into savage creatures, with the use of her ""Nighthowler"" serum.

But we did not know that Zootopia existed before we made the animations.Our show is also about Humanoid animals living together, but it's something different, its more like a cliche school thing. We wrote the scripts, storyboards and started planning for the future episodes, but with the copyright system., we may not make this animation real. We want to make it real, I just want to see how people react to the show and not call it a ripoff of this. My friends were excited to play a part in a big project, and we really want the animation to be done by the end of our summer. We appreciate and like your movie, and we hope you allow us to upload something similar to this but not too similar.

He also wouldn't shut up. Opening, the kid was screaming. Explosion, the kid was screaming. Emotional moment that would have been very heartwarming, that same kid was screaming. he also ran up and down the stairs and played with other kids. This ruined the movie for me, but it was still amazing. To Disney, good job. To parents, CONTROL YOUR CHILDREN OR LEAVE!! I don't care how old your kid is or the fact that it's a kid movie, it is your responsibility to know if your child would make noises before buying the tickets. Everyone else around you paid just as much money as you did to watch a movie, not listen to your screaming children, be considerate. To Krikorian Premiere Theaters, please have an employee go up the stairs every once in a while to make sure these inconsiderate parent don't ruin everything for the rest of us, Harkins does it and so can you.

When my older sister dragged me see this in the theaters with her, I thought it was going to be an immature movie for 3-year-olds. I was very wrong. This is one of the most mature children's films I've ever seen, and in a good way. It deals with issues like stereotyping/racism, and you've really got to credit it for that. Especially when kids my age (middle school-aged) are actually very racist, here in New York. It's a shame that they'll never see it. (If they thought Inside Out was babyish, imagine their reactions to this?) On the last few days of school, if we have time to watch a movie like we usually do, I'm definitely requesting this. The only bad thing I can say about the movie is that one portion that kinda made me cringe. (The ""Naturalist Club"", did they call it? I think so.)

The film talks about a bunny called Judy Hobbs and a fox named Nick Wilde. The bunny's dream was to become a cop in the capital, but she didn't know what problems and adventures she was getting involved with.¬†In my opinion, the best part about the movie was the music. There was a lot of music in the movie from many famous artists. I also loved the special effects and the ending.¬†In my opinion it's worth to watch the movie.

2020-03-22T02:59:17,"This movie is absolutely phenomenal, I'm rewatching it now and I love how they tackled all sorts of societal issues that are happening and have been happening in the human society for a very very long time. I'm glad they used non-human animals to use as a reference to racial issues, it's only such a shame that they didn't actually state that the concept of instinct doesn't exist. I'm super glad that they worked on the concept that explains that it is not the case of aggression or someone turning into a mindless monster, but totally missed the opportunity to point out that instinct is, with all due respect, bullshit. You see, now that I'm rewatching the movie with much more knowledge after studying animal cognition, behaviour, sentience, intelligence, etc for years, it is not the concept of instinct that drives animals forward, including us - it's intelligence. It's conscious thought, rationalising, personal choices and the desire to enjoy yourself. Every organism that exists is based on intelligence. Even individual cells contain code that's intelligence, and plants are capable of thought too. The biota of Earth, especially eukaryotic beings, are all incredibly complex organisms capable of complex thought and sense of self, it's just that the perception of life of each individual is different. Carnivores are specialised in using their intelligence for tactical hunts while herbivores are specialised in security and foraging. I could go on and write you a lengthy essay on how cognition works but let's just summarize it: we are animals and other animals are people; not a wild take, it's fact and scientists have done thousands of researches that confirm exactly that. ""Instinct"" is just a completely dumb term used to describe a misunderstood concept of complex cognitive abilities of non-human organisms, and intelligence and comprehension that they genetically and physically have, but each action they make is based on personal choice.   So, with that said, I can't wait for the sequel. Love this movie. :^)",1,0,Kredenc,jWM0ct-OLsM,0.09980952380952385,2020-03-22 02:59:17,False,False
