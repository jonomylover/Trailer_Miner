I love that it was filmed in Atlanta (mostly). There were a few plot holes but some were required to make the film work. For example, I would have welded the manhole cover by the first bank shut. The time between leaving the bank to rolling up to the Federal Reserve was way too fast. I suspect that the Fed probably x-rays money carts at some point in the process but maybe not. I'm missing one or two others that I can't remember at the moment. Like I said, it couldn't be this movie had they no't existed. Just my  observations.
