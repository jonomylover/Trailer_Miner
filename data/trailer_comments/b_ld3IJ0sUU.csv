I can live with the ""dank memes"" because hey, Shrek has been turned into one big internet joke, too, and those movies are actually good (minus Shrek the Third, which was boring as balls). Mall Cop 2 was funny. Not a funny that you have to catch your breath, but a funny that's genuine and leaves an impression. I'm a bit biased because I loved King of Queens, but anyone who has seen that show (or actually bothered to watch this movie, instead of bitching about it online) will know that Kevin James has an appealing comedy style. It's your everyday family flick and as most everyday family flicks, it revels in its absurdity, its cheesiness, its bargain bin concept. I feel people want movies that take themselves too seriously. They want a masterpiece. Stunning visual effects. Fluid animation. Realistic acting. A gritty story with complicated, morally-ambiguous characters. Violence. Drama. ""Movie of the Year"". Worthy of the Oscars.  So maybe you didn't ask for this sequel, but did you deliberately ask that it not be made? I didn't ask for Mall Cop 2 either, but heck, I laughed... and the fam laughed with me. And in the end, isn't that all that matters? If it's billed as a comedy, and does what it's supposed to... then is that not a successful piece of entertainment? So maybe it's a bit cliched. So maybe it has one or two Disney Channel actors. Mall Cop 2, Kevin James... if you can make it work, I'd support a Mall Cop 5 if it ever came down to it.  Only family comedy I wasn't very fond of for the 2014 year was Night at the Museum 3, which was an all-around mediocre sendoff to the franchise. The actors seemed to be tired of their roles, the plot seemed to be tired of itself, and it wasn't nearly as ambitious as its predecessors. Granted, neither Mall Cop 2 nor Museum 3 were very ambitious, but Mall Cop had something better to offer... livelier, more energetic fun that didn't drag on too long (unlike this comment).

2020-04-20T22:13:18,"Based off the trailer it's not terrible but haven't seen the second movie yet but a trailer is kind of supposed to represent the movie in a smaller sense so if the trailer shows us the audience something that is completely off from what the original presented us than we can assume the movie is most likely gonna be bad. Just like the mulan trailer live action one not having the goddamn dragon showing meaning that for some people something is vitally important as that will ruin the adaptation of what the movie is supposed to be.  So idk if this movie is ""funny"" or ""good"" but I don't like so far how it trails just so far away and it doesn't bring any if any of the old characters back and especially amy which makes me feel like they were just trying to grab people's fucking money to ruin a product. The first will forever be cherished cuz that was a good movie. I can see why Will Ferrell doesn't wanna make a step brothers 2 or an elf 2 cuz money grabbing story ruining pieces of shit will ruin a masterpiece just to make a quick buck.  Well. I'm now seeing the movie and feel like a fool after the fact that right in the beginning of the movie they adress the amy thing and the first 5 minutes in was like very funny so my mistake.
