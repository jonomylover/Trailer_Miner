I was so poor that at one point I was living in an 80 square foot studio apartment with no Wifi, no TV, no furniture, not even a standing lamp.  All I had to my name was a broken empty piggy bank, the dirty clothes on my body, and a red solo cup that I used to drink my water.  But, I had no running water.  So, I had to wait until it rained, and then stand outside to fill my cup.  One day I was sitting on the floor of my apartment, 100 thousand dollars in debt.  Both the landlord and a loan shark were pounding on my door, demanding the money I owed them.  It was at that moment I began to develop my 3 step process  to obtaining wealth.  Now I am incredibly rich, and making others incredibly rich.  And I'm going to show YOU how to get rich by giving away something to you for free...after which I'll ask you to pay a few hundred, or maybe even a few thousand dollars for the REALLY good training.  Hurry, though!  I only have a few spots left!  And if they fill up, it's too late.  You'll try to register and I'll actually turn down your money!  So, are you in?""The other night when I was playing Red Dead Redemption 2, I witnessed a man kidnapping a woman by horse. Playing as a badass western cowboy hero type, I was ready to take on the bad guy, save the girl and save the day! I unmounted my horse, took aim with my shotgun and.... I shot the girl on accident. The gunshot spooked my horse which fled in terror thus leaving me stranded in the woods. The bad guy then shot me in the chest and took off, getting away Scott free. I tried shooting back at him and missed, but the witnesses who saw me, thought that I was just some madman randomly shooting at people so they alerted the law who put a bounty on my head.

There's probably something to be said about these kind of storyline which also happens a lot in horror movies (in Carrie for example): the God-like powerful woman who must  be put down because there's no other choice and her powers make her a danger for everyone. Is it because the patriarcal society fears powerful women and they must be contained ? I think my teacher of psychoanalysis of film would think so ^^. Although Vanya ends up being saved by her sister who was the one who always believe she could be spared so that might be a feminist twist on the trope.

2019-02-28T10:12:56,"ok looks like Mystique bites it in this one. Not surprising as Jennifer Lawrence is so over the hours and hours of getting painted blue. Everybody else should survive? Storm, Nightcrawler and Cyclops were just introduced in the last movie. Quicksilver seems unlikely as his scenes in the X movies are arguably the best.   That leaves Xavier and Beast. McAvoy could be tired of the role (and shaving his head) but Jean killing Xavier again in a remake eeehhhh........I suppose Beast could be a casualty. Magneto........dunno. Teasing 2 deaths in the trailer? Magneto lives. Anybody new that shows up all bets are off unless it's a major character.    Who is Smith? She's an alien.....the Dark Phoenix Saga involved an alien race called the Shiar. Could she be one of them in disguise? Deathbird perhaps? Could we really get to see the Shiar vs the X-Men? If so, it would almost have to be done in two movies. It would be a lot to cram in.    As far as the timeline goes, in Days of Future Past, Wolverine time jumped back and forth and at the end everything seemed great. However, this doesnt mean the timeline he left behind didnt take an alternate course. It just may not have affected the timeline he went back to. Time travel can get confusing. Anyway it's just a movie but the bigger problem for me is how the movies are set a decade apart yet no one ages. the first was set in the 60s, the 2nd in the 70s, the 3rd in the 80s and this one on the 90s. So it is basically just like a comic book. Oh well I'll give it a chance.

When will you stop pandering to the people who never bought a single comic book in their entire life & instead make a movie for those that supported series such as this? As one of those people I have grown weary of the amazing source material that exists & how you've disappointed us time & again. The Age of Apocalypse is long overdue! That would make for a ground breaking movie which fans would be super enticed giving what happens. The 'Onslaught' story  has been neglected as well. Using 'Legion' as the lead into Onslaught should not be left out. You've ruined the Wolverine origin story which is an amazing & you üí© all over it like the night after a Taco Bell binge! Sabretooth is another character who should get his own movie using 'Death Hunt' . Next, for goodness sake- please use the REAL Rogue with all her powers using a new actress with an adequate body (sexy but a bit muscular as the character is)!!! Rogue is a Beloved character as was Jubilee and you've done nothing worthy with either of them. If the special effects isn't done right you get the crap of Apocalypse & Juggernaut which were laughable & sad so do it right  or don't bother. On a side note, in case you aren't paying attention- don't use actors with a political agenda (Capt. Marvel) because people go to he entertained not lectured to beforehand making us hate the supposed 'hero'. Since Hollywood is all about Social Justice crap then why don't you cast the next Wolverine as the short character he is?? He doesn't need to be 5' 3"" but 5' 7"" would be adequate.

2019-02-28T14:21:52,"The beginning dialogue and performance from Sophie is not great throughout the entire trailer.  There are a couple good body language moments though.  She looks good! I especially like the part where it looks like she is attempting to crush Magneto skull with his own helmet.  I really have not enjoyed the character nor the actor playing him.  Ian was really a good.  Have to skip to Storm because she is my favorite X-men.  Though I still don't care for the actress playing her, I have to admit in the TRAILER, its nice to see her attempting to have an African accent and it looks like she may have an epic Storm moment using her powers.  Though that scene could've been the only time she really goes all out in the movie.  You know how they did in Apocalypse and DOFP trailer and we still saw Storm held back in the actual movie.  She lead the X-men sooo many times and other teams but yet she continues to be a supportive character with no real place.  Glad this is fox's last version and maybe Marvel will do a way better job to incorporate her African heritage and her life with the X-men.  Touch on her magical heritage and reveal her unlimited ability.   I still think a better actress with darker skin should play her next. Not a another biracial actress..Storm was straight African with dark skin.   I know in the movie Phoenix will be unstoppable and take down all the X-men at the same time, however for people who follow comics, we know Storm is not only what the movie portrays.  She has ascended into Godhood particularly having the powers of a Norse God and even before then she revealed unlimited elemental powers in early comic issues and almost destroyed the entire X-men team and a country.  Be nice if they would've played on that, not the Norse God power part, and having her the only X-men with the most powerful destruction power to even stand against Phoenix considering Storm natural powers allows her to resist telepathy as well. Before people say ""oh Phoenix is life and death blah blah"", I'm talking in terms of standing up against her in a fight which none of the X-men can do other than Storm. We all know if this was the real world, even been stuck by lightening, you can die or even be hurled in a tornado, frozen to death or having the air drained from your body. I get it in superhero world that is not the case and with Dark Phoenix, Jean has to be the highlight as the most powerful villian that is unstoppable.  A phoenix imbued Jean that is!  Moving on, so  Quicksilver is for 10 yr old viewers..i get it, but that scene with him challenging Phoenix..man bye.  What do you think you can do against her and you're just running.  Why only show him attacking Phoenix.  They needed Rogue for this battle with her super strength, flight and power absorption, she also has high resistant to damage and cant take the hits better than any X-men,  but oh well.  Also, even though Wolverine has had enough screen time, I feel you can't do a dark phoenix without him.  It plays on their affection for one another.   Where is Psylocke?  Two telepaths are better than one when battling Phoenix.  I'm not letting this trailer lure me into the theatres. I really feel like Professor, Jean, Magneto, Mystique, Cyclops and Beast are going to be the highlights with the most screen time and dialogue while Storm, Quicksilver and Nightcrawler end up being left behind.  I'll wait for IGN review and what others are saying and I may go if is turns out surprisingly good despite the already horrible reviews of screen testings.",0,0,J P,q5v7Ch4bxzc,0.17864197530864193,2019-02-28 14:21:52,True,True

I've always felt Kinberg was too reluctant to fully embrace the ""comic"" aspect of the brand and tried to do with the X-Men what Nolan did w/ Batman - which I find folly because Nolan's trilogy wasn't considered the ""best blah blah blah"" til well after Heath Ledger's untimely passing and people had finally stopped laughing about BaneINO and that insipid ending.  But more importantly, Batman is kind of built to be grounded whereas the X-Men are firmly rooted in the fantastical.  It'd be like trying to do a ""grounded"" Dr. Strange movie, it would be bland and lifeless.  Kinberg should have taken a page from Taititi's playbook and went all in on the comic quirkiness, not so much the immature humor, but the willingness to embrace the other-worldly aspect of X-Men comics.",0,0,BakemonoShiz,q5v7Ch4bxzc,0.23020833333333335,2019-02-28 14:52:59,True,True

If your a true fan of the X-men and it‚Äôs one of your favorite cartoon growing up then you will understand how they have killed this franchise!!  I admire their courage to keep going to the end and I do appreciate they are giving us the final movie before handing it over to the MCU...The things that bother me is: 1: Mystique - What have they done to her, I know they erased the timeline in Days of Future Past but her as a Hero and in a Costume with Skin that looks nothing as good as compared to the 2000s X-men Mystique is just terrible. They had better CGI in the early X-men Movies, that Mystque was perfect!! 2. They bring random characters in like Psylocke and Jubilee in X-men Apocalypse and they won‚Äôt appear here so what is the point in bringing them into the franchise and not utilize the characters...And don‚Äôt say Screen time because Avengers managed it perfectly!! 3. Wheres Lilandra and the Shia‚Äôr Guards as they help stop and fight the Phoenix, instead they chuck this random white hair lady in...Okay!! 4. They rushed every movie, Apocalypse and the Phoenix Saga could have had 2 Movies each but instead they cram everything into one which leads to a big mess!!  Emma Frost and the Hellfire club has a big part but since they introduced and rushed their characters to an early grave back in First Class there‚Äôs no luck seeing these in this movie. Instead we see people that wasn‚Äôt even a part of the original X-men, they just grouped any random characters they felt like and assembled a team, it‚Äôs really shocking!!  I really hope MCU will set things right for X-MEN and go by the Cartoon with Sentinels and Jubilee, Gambit and Rogue as X-men in it and not a weak pathetic Rogue, the one from the cartoons with the actual accents!!

At  this point after the rescue we find out that her powers were responsible and she feels guilty for killing her mother. We find out that her dad is still alive though so she escapes the mansion all emotional to go find him.  ‚ÄúWhen Jean got hit by the cosmic rays she sent the spaceship flying into space and somehow it f***ing lands on an alien planet. The aliens look at the wreckage and go ‚Äòf*** it this means war. Let's go get the Phoenix force‚Äô.That's literally their whole motivation.‚Äù They continued: ‚ÄúJean finds her dad and she gets pissed that Charles lied to her about her parents being dead. But Charles lied because her dad didn't want her anymore. When she finally realises all of this she almost kills her dad but the X‚Äìmen come to save her. She is really edgy at this point.  ‚ÄúShe kills Mystique by accident. Beast gets all mad because he loved her. Beast goes to find Magneto for help to defeat Jean. Charles takes the rest of the team to get to Jean before the aliens and Beast/Magneto can.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMovie is so boring I'm sorry if this isn't the best description but the movie ends with a CGI battle and it‚Äôs not very exciting because the aliens look boring and have generic levitation powers (they do shape shift into humans but they LOOK NOTHING LIKE SKRULLS AND THE WORD SKRULL IS NEVER SAID).  ‚ÄúThere is an alien invasion and Jean flies into space and gives up all her powers to destroy the fleet.

2019-03-01T01:43:24,"What's interesting is it's not the Phoenix turning Jean dark it's Jean turning the Phoenix Dark. The Phoenix is a life giving creative force it's always came to Jean's help like in the comics when it saved Jean from crossing over into the spirit world after Jean tried to bring her friend back from the dead and like in this instance where Jean was need of saving and called out to it and it possessed her. The issue comes in with Jean's repressed memories of killing her parents as Charles psychic blocks wear off of Jean and Jean begins to understand what happened to her parents her own emotional reaction to her powers contributing to the death of her parents is what actually agitates the Phoenix force and because it's never felt feelings of despair, depression, anger & confusion accompanied by the sheer gravity of it's limitless power that Jean Grey is in possession of it's Jeans own pain thats using that phoenix force in a twisted way morphing it's nature and intention. Also not only can I tell from the trailer that mystique dies, but I also believe Quick Silver dies they always make sure Jean kills at least two of her teams mates just like in The Last Stand (Xavier & Cyclops) if you notice quick silver isn't in a lot of the scene's either I believe something happens to him as well. I also think when Beast says, ""this your fault charles"" he's eluding to the Mystique's death that came by way of what she complained about after the space mission which was that Charles kept sending the Team on more and more lavish and complicated missions and thats probably cuz Charles was so excited that Mutants and Humans were finally in appreciation of each other that he became overly ambitious, but that ambition is what led to the space mission that led to Jean's encounter with this cosmic force that led to all the events that followed this encounter which has now put the entire planet in jeopardy so that coupled with Charles executive decision to keep apart of Jean's life hidden from her seems to be the thread that tears the Xmen in half and Im looking forward to seeing how they deal with Charle's behavior the results of his decisions in this movie.",1,0,Consciouz Tv,q5v7Ch4bxzc,0.054301075268817195,2019-03-01 01:43:24,True,True

That is the only character they protrayed well and would be hard to find some actor to make an equal or even enough good of a portrayal to replace the original wolverine. But if the guy is at least an ""ok"", portrays the character a bit better and the plot is overall better then you have a good movie anyways. Once you have that, you must find better choices for all the characters, and then reboot it again following THE DAMN PLOT AS IT IS WRITTEN ON THE COMICS.... come on guys, it's written there, you dont need to make stuff up or mix everything into a mashed potato. You made like 10 movies, and you destroyed the plot. I know the original plot could be made in even less movies!  Then:  -get the damn suits right (blue and yellow with a red X!) -get the damn actors right (not kids! no ""idiot"" or ""good"" faces if they're the bad guys! (or will become bad guys) -get the GODDAMN ORIGINAL XMEN THEME SONG (we all want that ""dun dun dan dun, dun dun den dun"")",10,4,Fino Diez,q5v7Ch4bxzc,0.0852655474606694,2019-03-01 04:29:28,True,True

2019-03-01T06:01:16,"Do you understand that there are so many preludes promoting the appearance of the biblical beast? First, in fact, all types of machines, especially those driven by electricity, slowly and quickly turn into a beast, that is, into a computerized global machine for centralized management, to ensure full control over goods and people throughout the earth.  Especially the banking system, through which practically most of the cash flows pass, and which provides money to people with interest rates so that they can actually buy and sell a lot of necessary goods.  Soon, banking platforms such as Mastercard, VISA, PayPal and many others become active agents of the future beast or artificial intelligence machines in combination with satanic technologies for effective control over global trade.  Plastic credit cards and identity cards are already serving evil and Satan.  But with their obstinate statements, which are in fact false ideas, such as rapture, Jesus died for our sins and others, they want to justify their way of life that they have.  .............  A real example of the eRumor as it has appeared on the Internet:  Dr. Hanrick Eldeman, Chief Analyst of the Common Market Confederacy in Brussels, has revealed that a computerized restoration plan is already under way to straighten out world chaos. A crisis meeting in early 1974 brought together Common Market leaders, advisers and scientists at which time Dr. Eldeman unveiled ‚Äúthe Beast‚Äù. The Beast is a gigantic three story computer located in the administrative building of the headquarters of the Common Market. That monster is a self-programming computer that has more than one hundred sources distributing entries. Experts in programming have perfected a plan that will handle by computer all of the world‚Äôs trade. This master plan would imply a system of digital enumeration of each human being of the earth. Thus the computer would give each inhabitant of the world a number to be used for each purchase or sale, removing the problem of present credit cards. This number would be invisibly tatooed by laser, either on the forehead or on the back of the hand. This would establish a walking credit card system. And the number could be seen only through infrared scanners, installed in special verification counters or in business places  666  Dr.Eldeman pointed out that by using three entries of six digits each, every inhabitant of the world would be given a distinct credit card number.   .............  Does the beast supercomputer really exist ?¬†¬†  Yes ! From fiction in 1974 HOAX then no computer, to Fact now. B.E.A.S.T. (Battle Engagement Area Simulation and Tracking)¬† It's a A.I. machine¬†  America's Central Computer System  ""The Beast""¬†  The central computer for America is in Texas, and the international computer that ties all the national central computers together is situated in Brussels, Belgium.¬†  The Brussels computer is housed in a 13 story building, the first three floors of which are occupied totally by this system's hardware. Because of its size, the Brussels computer is referred to affectionately as 'The Beast.'  ""This immense computer has enough capacity to store every detail about the lives of every human being on Earth, the information contained in the Library of Congress, and every book ever printed.¬†  Having operated for years, it stores a growing volume of information as additional countries tie into it every more heavily.""   It goes on to describe how some computers are defined by their size and shape. One is ""a six-core memory computer with 60 bytes per word in conjunction with six bits to the character. It is named and advertised as the 6-60-6.""¬†  The CIA has a huge Underground Complex under CERN because nobody would ever guess.¬†  The Person's who controls the A.I. machine controls the whole world.",0,0,just man,q5v7Ch4bxzc,0.04606413994169097,2019-03-01 06:01:16,True,True

2019-03-01T07:51:59,"I love the xmen, but these movies are just missing a few things, which it would be amazing if they had these cast members for Xmen First classs, and recast wolverine....  But its missing the super heroes and universe of the mcu,  FUN FACT, it was originally the Fantastic four and the avengers who inspired the xmen to become super heroes, they model themselves as the avengers strike team for mutant kind.  The classic costumes, which I understand are here, but Im talking about the individual suits, and its missing wolverine. Wolverine is the xmens ace in the hole, their tank, Sure wolverine would need to take a back seat, or they can play it like they have always done in the comics, but when it comes down to it, they cant just get rid of cyclops to make room for more wolveie, I wolverine should have a role to play as the guy who is willing to do what it takes to get shit done in the xmen, but every other dynamic here would be perfect for the mcu xmen, they just have toon implement the other core aspects. Like the other shiarr worlds, the other mutants, Weapon X, wolverine in his suit, the xmen getting exposed to the world through a big battle happening at the mall.  Hopefully marvels xmen follows the official lore, Hope they don't do what they did with cap marshit bag and rush through everything.  The Xmen deserve a proper saga. Starting with Weapon X part 1 and Xmen first class.  I am into this thought, Im curious to see the foxmen universe end, It was great for what it was, But It has never tried to be the actual comic version of these characters, because obviously they cant, and should marvel waste the opportunity, this will be the only xmen series worth anything.  So be greatful these actors were in this version, and not marvel studios upcoming weird PC xmen, when Xmen always represented diversity and all that shit through their different mutations and abilities.  You don't need to recast anyones race or sex, because that's not what good story telling is about.

I love the X-Men movies but i hate it how they make Magneto weaker and weaker in every new movie just to make the main villain of the movie look stronger and more threatening. For those of you who don't read comics, here is a short list of what Magneto can do with his powers:   - He can subdue The Red Hulk ( who is traditionally even stronger than The Hulk ). Red Hulk is one of the most OP characters in Marvel comics btw. -  He has defeated the Avengers on two separate occasions. Thor was one of the Avengers present and Magneto defeated him as well. Didn't even break a sweat. - His electromagnetic shields are so powerful that he even survived a nuclear explosion. Not only that but he used his shields to protect not only himself but also many members of the X-men and of the Avengers. - In the comics his electromagnetic shields are so powerful that he can protect himself even against the Phoenix Force ( So fuck you movie if Jean kills Eric in this movie ). - In the comics he once created a Wormhole in order to save his children, Quicksilver and Scarlet Which. Seeing how Quicksilver looks like he is about to be killed by the Phoenix Force in this movie, I hope he uses this power to save him. - in the ‚ÄúAge of Apocalypse‚Äù a story which takes place in an alternative timeline, Apocalypse is basically the ruler of the entire world and some of the most powerful Marvel characters try and fail to stop him. But Magneto wrecks the guy. I mean he literally tears him to pieces with his powers.   Magneto is basically a God in the comics.

It is painfully obvious that she has zero knowledge of the character's original personality, and her presence is extremely forced.

But unfortunately this is the first time I'm not excited for an X-Men movie I always I'm pumped for the trailer and sometimes I'm let down a little by the movies but I always enjoy them through for the most part now this movie looks really uninspired really generic and their retelling a story that technically still exists and the fucked-up X-Men continuity unless if days of Futures Past fixed it but it didn't. First class and days of Future Past should have been the last 2 of the franchise until the Marvel Cinematic Universe reboot.

All ""seven"" Infinity Stones contains a cosmic entity in it. The Mind Stone is the Phoneix Force, the Power Stone is Galactus, the Soul Stone is Death, the Reality Stone is the Beyonder, the Time Stone is Agamatto, and the Space Stone is Singularity. They will be shoehorned into the MCU. As it was said in Age of Ultron, Loki's sceptre was used to ""awaken"" Scarlet Witch and Quiksilver's powers (who happen to be Mutants). The other ""experimentees"" failed, and werent given powers by the sceptre. Obviously, mutations have been called the next level of evolution. Evolution has to do with the mind. In Guardians of the Galaxy the Collector explains the Infinity Stones. When he explains the Power Stone an image is shown of a man. This man is Galan/ Galactus who survived the Crunch/Big Bang that created the new universe. Just look it up. If you were to look up Infinity War deleted scenes, you would find a pre production video of Thanos explaining to Loki that he has to kill him. Thanos says he is just a messenger. He is saying he is Deaths messenger. Fieg said that Death isnt in the MCU. She can still appear in the MCU. Just because a character isn't referred to or appears in a movie(technically Death appears alongside Entropy, Infinity, and Eternity on a mural in the beginning of Guardians of the Galaxy) doesnt mean they cant appear. And they dont want to bring up Thanos to be this badass, to be dealt with guy, who harnessed power that can ""kill"" half of all life and just say he is a supporting character to a more badass character.

I think that would be a good story on both Morph and Wolverine's friendships though Morph irked Wolverine a lot in the television series when he was a jokester as for Forge, he and Bishop did some time traveling together a long with the X-men. Since the Dark Phoenix is coming out soon why hasn't FOX mentioning anything about Mr. Sinister with no based related movie trailer or story from the last X-men Apocalypse franchise from the end credits scene of ESSEX Corp.? No talks about the character at all or maybe he'll be a surprise villain? And what's going on with the Gambit, movie?

2019-03-03T18:23:08,"I'll save you all some money, here's what's going to happen in this shitty popcorn CGI fest:  Child Jean tries to use her psionics to prevent the spirit of a loved one from passing to the other side, she begins to get dragged over herself, during this the Phoenix force takes note and saves her by severing the psionic link she's made with the deceased.  Some time later Charles Xavier shows up (motivated by his interaction with future self) and is terrified of Jean's potential, so he uses his psionics to seal her growth.   Years later, through some traumatic circumstance Jean breaks free of this and due to her stunting her powers are incredibly out of control. The Xmen show up at her house and she kicks their ass and then disappears.  Emma Frost finds Jean and begins to manipulate her for whatever paper thin motivation the Hellfire club has. Alternative, we get a brief interaction of Emma Frost with Mastermind and that's left there to set up future films.   In order to stop Jean the Xmen engage with her in space and kick her ass. Well almost, except the Phoenix Force fully connects with Jean in this moment, and Dark Phoenix begins her destructive rampage.  About an hour of Phoenix being a badass, our heroes getting beat, contrived 'suspense', humans being assholes to mutants. Finally, the plot pieces all fall into place and Charles (most likely with Magneto's help) breaks through to Jean's mind and calms her. Super neat and convenient with no real lost stakes or long term negative ramifications.   Conflict over. The end.",23,7,Kivan,q5v7Ch4bxzc,0.015972222222222228,2019-03-03 18:23:08,True,True

If I was Marvel I would use the Phoenix & Thanos's snap to merge the universes.   I would have used Captain Marvel to set it up. Have Carol Danvers meet Charles Xavier & Logan. Maybe add dialogue recognizing the ""x virus"" or ""disease x"". There'd be no need to add Xmen as the presence of Professor X (McAvoy) & Wolverine (Radcliffe) would link the realities. You could then have had Xmen Dark Phoenix come out after Captain Marvel. Being a few years after Carol left. Throw in mentions of the Kree & Thanos during dialogue with The Phoenix. Then have the Phoenix be too powerful. Have it throw the Xmen through time. Into Avengers Endgame!  Have Avengers Endgame leave only Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Spiderman, Dr Strange, Captain America (Bucky) & Antman. Gamora & Groot will form new Guardians. Thor & Valkryie will go off to rebuild. Retire 1 or 2, but most must die. Then focus on the above & Xmen.  Grief causes an event to be etched into memory. If you kill of most & create a void, people will have a vested interest in the outcome. If you fill said void with the Xmen...

2019-03-04T09:39:26,"And just because practically everyone else is complaining about it: I can see what they're trying to achieve with the bright, neon-ish colors of Mystique and Beast's new palettes. Recently, in Superhero movies, colors have become darker and more muted to look less cheesy like their old, garishly colored comic designs, and be taken more seriously in a visual sense. So they probably think that these colors (which are not quite a throwback, since they use CMYK colors instead of RGB ones) will stand out to people, and separate it from their and other's previous superhero films. I also know there's a lot of psychology behind colors, so they probably thought that this would attract people's attention. And, well, it doesn't seem like they were wrong. Whether or not I like it personally...I'm not sure. I think the hair might be a little much, but I do tend to like those colors in general. CMYK palettes just look better to me.

2019-03-04T20:48:50,THE X-MEN ARE ALL GOING TO DIE !!!!! Do I see a reboot coming into the MCU Remember contracts are up. Easter Egg at the end of the movie will be a fracture in the time/space line that opens the X-men Universe into the MCU through the Phoenix entity. SHE IS A HIGH POWER  ENTITY IN THE MCU. REMEMBER THIS COMES OUT AFTER AVENGERS ENDGAME on JUNE 7th. This will help set up PHASE 4 of the MCU. You may think that this X-Men movie is not significant but they did reshoot a great deal of it. Notice it is the most cosmic scenes ever seen in any X-men movie trailer ever. They can still hint at the next phase under the FOX/DISNEY merger without actually saying anything. You'll see the Shi'ar The Kree and The Scrull empires best heroes and whoever is left from Earth having to combine to fight the PHOENIX FORCE.

Last movie she literally stood there and looked good (subjective) except at the very end for like 1 minute. But really I think that the movie director blew it so i wont put it all on her.  All in all, its an X-MEN movie and I haven't missed one yet and i don't see a reason to start now.  So while I have zero-hype for this movie, and no expectations except it will be interesting.

I haven't been into comics but it's really intriguing me to the point where I've been reading up on it lately. And also. How is this connected to the end game things etc. Please help.,0,3,Tashreeq,q5v7Ch4bxzc,0.06874999999999999,2019-03-07 14:43:27,True,True

One, you haven't had enough of an emotional attachment to Jean Grey herself, she is always seen in context to either Cyclops (another under developed character), or Wolverine (an OVER developed character). We don't have an attachment to her that doesn't involve someone else. Thus we have nothing to draw on in this movie to identify with her on any meaningful level. Two, you cannot possibly tell the Dark Phoenix Saga in a single movie. This is a minimum 2 part, and if you do it right a trilogy in and of itself. The majority of the X-Men stories are too damn long for a single movie, but Fox being the windowlickers they are, never figured that out until well after the MCU perfected the idea of an entire cinematic universe.  This might be entertaining on some levels, but there is only so much of a real story to develop without more attachment to Jean Grey herself, you can't do all of that in 1 movie.... sorry.",0,0,Dick White,q5v7Ch4bxzc,0.019494047619047616,2019-03-09 16:15:06,True,True

2019-03-13T09:34:35,I love the actors for the most part but I don't know why I find this casting choice for Jean annoying. I care nothing for her character now.  So having a movie around her feels kind of...meh.  I really hope it'll be better than the Last Stand which was garbage.   I do like JLaw but the last couple movies it was like she was lecturing everyone and taking all the attention which I didn't like. And now it feels a bit like that. Oh and her makeup is horrible.  Did they spend all their money doing CGI and run out for the actual makeup?  The colour of the hair & sin colour is off and the stickers aren't right. The eyes aren't right either...  but I guess other than that it looks good.   McAvoy without hair still weirds me out but he does a good channelling of Patrick Stewart when he yells here.  And Fassbender looks amazing and hopefully he's in this one more than the last one.,0,0,Starbits7,q5v7Ch4bxzc,0.19146825396825398,2019-03-13 09:34:35,True,True

2019-06-09T22:25:15,"First of all, I‚Äôm pretty much aware that there are lots of bad reviews out there. I‚Äôm sure that you‚Äôve seen them as well. The thing is, ‚ÄúX-Men: Dark Phoenix‚Äù is not as bad as what critics are saying. In my opinion, this film is better than ‚ÄúX-Men: Apocalypse‚Äù and the previous Phoenix Saga adaptation, ‚ÄúX-Men: The Last Stand‚Äù.  ‚ÄùX-Men: Dark Phoenix‚Äù clearly shows that Sophie Turner is strong enough to carry this film, she‚Äôs amazing. Even though the script for the film is a bit generic, not to mention that there are some cringeworthy ones. The first and the second act of the film are a bit slow, however, things are getting 180¬∞ different in the third act. By different, I mean in a good way. The entire soundtrack of the film is excellent, as the entire score is composed by Hans Zimmer.  From the recurring cast, James McAvoy‚Äôs Professor X and Michael Fassbender‚Äôs Magneto got their awesome chemistry as usual. Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult are also amazing. I can finally feel the chemistry of Tye Sheridan‚Äôs Scott with Sophie Turner‚Äôs Jean. It‚Äôs also nice knowing that Kodi Smit-McPhee‚Äôs Nightcrawler and Alexandra Shipp‚Äôs Storm finally deserve more spotlight. The newcomer Jessica Chastain, she‚Äôs good but her villain role is weak, and I‚Äôm not talking about her powers. It‚Äôs just I can‚Äôt feel her role as a villain. Here‚Äôs an advice, keep your eyes sharp to see some cameos of X-Men‚Äôs familiar mutants from the comics.  In the end, despite what the critics are saying, ‚ÄúX-Men: Dark Phoenix‚Äù is still quite enjoyable and entertaining. A decent way to end FOX‚Äôs X-Men franchise, kinda.  7/10  If you‚Äôre wondering for a credit scene, the answer is no, there are no mid or post credit scene for this film.  #XMen #DarkPhoenix",3,0,Cahya Nur Rahmah,q5v7Ch4bxzc,0.1487403100775194,2019-06-09 22:25:15,False,True
