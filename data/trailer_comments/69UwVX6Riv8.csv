This movie is over three hours long but the suspense and action keep you entertained throughout. The movie is filled with a lot of violence and profanity. It's an ""equal opportunity offender""- it contains enough controversial material to offend everyone. The offensive material contained in the movie includes: violence against women; racism towards African Americans; racism towards Mexicans; violence against the elderly; sodomy; and excessive use of force by law enforcement officials.

2016-01-10T15:53:35,"I perused through a couple of reviews of Tarantino's latest movie, ""The Hateful Eight."" I have not seen any of his work since ""Pulp Fiction,"" because principally and morally I believe revenge in the hands of man is reprehensible and offers NO restitution, NO closure of any kind. And, the theme of revenge and its merits are what ""Kill Bill"" and the rest of his films that followed appear to forward.  I can't deny that Quentin is masterful at his trade...""Pulp Fiction"" was cinematic excellence, bar none. But, I tend to shy away from Hollywood Directors who say they want to conjure up every imaginable manner of KILLING someone, then show you in gruesome detail how that's done. And, the film's message is typically the same: if someone hurts you, hurt them right back... and make sure to murder them in front of their 5-year old child while you're at it.  Sorry, but that's just not my idea of entertainment. Life offers enough pain and suffering. Why would I want to pay $14 to incur two more hours of it?

2017-05-02T21:47:21,Quentin Tarantino did nothing to hurt his reputation as a brilliant director with this movie. The entire setup is wickedly beautiful : because of a blizzard a bunch of killers are practically forced to live together for what would be a very short time in a remote haberdashery in Wyoming shortly after the Civil War .,0,0,Contakum,69UwVX6Riv8,0.18579545454545454,2017-05-02 21:47:21,False,False

2020-02-24T04:59:31,"That's a Tarantino. 2 hours of chat and laugh. Leading to 20 minutes of emotions. Hey Cow boys got somethinng for a 21:9 (no jokes). I think Dolby or Imax rooms as current badass.... But an Imax is mostly vertical. See Nolan. Why put a widescreen shoot that is vertical to an horizontal? On the other side; it is likely more immersive. I like to see movies on the front so I see no differences. Even now I like the rooms projecting old ones (you see the diffecence; FPS flash). The blanks are blinkings on old projectors; you see in a second it is analog projection.   Put a friend in an art house to see ""Natural Born Killers"". The second it was projected I knew it was analog. And make me happy.",0,0,feckingud,69UwVX6Riv8,0.16474358974358974,2020-02-24 04:59:31,False,False
