2015-05-02T02:28:03,I really Loved the Last two. Although i did not liked the way they potrayed the out of body or astral projection experiences. But still it was great horror and the way the whole story was woven into the two chapters was impeccable. So this final chapter better give us the best shivers and goosebumbs. -.- and for all those who are saying it wont be great or filled with jump scares please do share what do you want from a film of such sort. And sometimes you just have to let the horror seep in or else it doesnt work. Now not evry film builds up tension like the SINISTER. hoping great from that also. :) :-),1,0,RAJAT KANTI Bhattacharjee,3HxEXnVSr1w,0.384375,2015-05-02 02:28:03,True,True
