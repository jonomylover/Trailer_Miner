It's almost as if they don't realize they could be such much more than that on film. I'm sorry, but I'm tired of watching movies with the same, tired, generic, overdone ""messages"" about something so arbitrary and meaningless as race. They've been doing that whole shtick for a good 6 years now. It's boring, and to be completely honest, most of these ""issues"" aren't even real issues. The race sentencing gap is anywhere between 5 and 10% (with some research showing it narrows down to 0% if one takes into account criminal history or past offenses). Yes, we all agree in principle it SHOULD be 0%... but meanwhile the *gender* sentencing gap is over 63% and literally not a single soul cares. Hollywood would *NEVER* make a movie about how ""men"" specifically and generally are oppressed by the court system, because that's not a ""progressive"" message that people are willing to accept. The fact of the matter is, if a black man is sentenced too harshly, it's not a result of him being black, but rather, the result of him being male. That's a statistically factual, yet no one talks about this honestly... and I'm just tired of the same old ""here's another movie about black oppression"" game. I can't believe this shit sells.

My Wife cried and I was stung by how gripping the scenes are. I have been in a prison as a guard and visitor. Believe me this movie cuts deep. Even sadder how we still deal with these same issues today. How disturbing that ""they"" don't want us free=(racism). Sadder still those of us who don't want to be free or know how=(enslavement).  One day though......we're all going to be free. Also the casting director and everyone involved did excellent in casting the actors with striking similarities.

2020-02-20T23:15:33,"I saw this movie. It was great. I loved it. It shows a lot of history from the south. Walter McMillan was innocent. The south was very cruel with blacks in history. There never was any physical evidence that Walter killed that girl. The only evidence against him was that he was last person to have talked with the 18-year-old girl who was killed. But there never was any physical evidence that he did it. The girl's body was bloody all over and her body was dragged around. If Walter would've been the one to do that, there would've been blood on his clothes and on his hands. He was wearing the same clothes all day the day he got arrested. There was no blood on his shirt, his overalls, and his boots, or even his hands. If he had blood in any of his clothes or on his hands, someone would've noticed it. But his kids and some of his neighbors were with him the whole time he spoke with that girl.
