2015-12-25T15:55:07,You are suppose to feed it because the boy's  essence or soul is inside the doll. He must have jumped into this doll while he was in agonizing pain. His only escape must of been  to transfer his soul into that doll. Something so innocent and childish looking should not  be taken as a joke. Even though it's just a doll that can intimidate it should be treated with respect. I use to be a Voodoo Priest so I know just exactly how dolls can be used. Of course for you normal people I highly doubt you will ever understand because it's something out of this world right?  I mean you can't imagine a doll coming to life right?  Then I would suggest a different type of movie  for those who are ignorant and can't seem to understand where this is coming from.  I think chucky fans will like it but it's nowhere near chucky.  Chucky made us laugh but I don't think this  one will. That boy doll looks possessed ,0,0,Javier Morales,XGbB9UQ6r1g,0.12657738095238097,2015-12-25 15:55:07,True,True

Like.. -I get Brahm's parents lied about him dying so he wouldn't get in trouble for killing his childhood friend, but did him actually getting burned in the fire have to be neccesary? Or was it a coincidence he got burned so they just used that as a chance?  -was there other nannies before Greta came into the picture? And if so did they all end up dead?  -And lastly, if the parents were so fed up with the 'real' Brahms, why didn't they ditch him a long time ago?  - And actually last one, you think Brahm's actually enjoyed watching Greta be nice to his doll version? It'd make more sense to me if he just interacted with her in person. Or is he just too socially fucked up? Lol anyways I know its just a movie but I wanted to see if anyone had answers to this confusing ass movie. Plus did you like it?

He was living in the walls of the house so that he would never go to jail for killing Emily! The parents obviously knew cuz the letter they sent said so and how else would Brahms be living in the walls for that long without food or shit. That's why they don't throw away food, so that Brahms can take it to his room in the walls. I like how the walls were see through from inside out so that he could spy on the girl. It was creepy realizing that this entire time it was a grown ass man living with her alone and not a haunted doll. It was freaking scary how Brahms himself,was wearing a doll mask. And let me just say this, it was BADASS HOW BRAHMS CAME OUT AT THE END. breaks the freaking wall and you just see a hole in the wall with a hand coming out and asking for gretta(the girl).

That said, like a lot of other movies this one was full of annoying cliches, people just seem to think this one is less stupid because there was a twist at the end; it's like all it takes for people to think a movie was good is if there was a twist,no matter how shitty the rest of it was. Tbh, I expected the twist to be more clever. [[[SPOILERS AHEAD]]] I expected it to be that it turns out Malcolm was actually Brahms, that he'd been staying in the house the whole time and stalking Greta while acting like 'the gentle good guy.' I thought the 'Brahms' living in the walls who was making phone calls would turn out to be the girl whom Brahms had supposedly murdered in childhood, and that that's why that person wore a mask now (to conceal a woman's face). Otherwise it wouldn't make sense for a fully-grown man to speak in a child's voice on the phone and so on. I thought the person living in the walls would turn out to be 'good' despite being freaky and that she would save Greta when Malcolm would eventually attack her, or something like that.",1,0,Rainy Jane,XGbB9UQ6r1g,-0.015147783251231527,2016-11-30 22:45:29,False,False
