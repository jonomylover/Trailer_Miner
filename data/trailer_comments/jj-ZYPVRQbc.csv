I'd love for this to be so good, it wins an Oscar for best picture, best director, best actor and best actress.   And for all the circus Will Smith and co. made last year about black filmmakers not being nominated, I didn't want Smith or Spike Lee or the NWA guys to be nominated last year, because they didn't deserve it IMO. But if this is as good as the trailer suggests, I'm rooting for Denzel and co. to win.

We know what's going to happen. We know how the story is going to end. There's The Butler, The Great Debaters, The Pursuit of Happiness, The Help, The Color Purple, The Grave Diggers Daughter, Chiraq, and 12 Years a Slave. For the sake of story telling, shouldn't we have more movies that show black people in different roles? Shouldn't black folks be entitled to have a good time? I bet they're going to nominate this movie for an Academy Award, because these types of movies are the only ones that will get nominated.  I'm not a Madea fan, but Tyler Perry is very successful despite his bad ratings from critics. He realizes that black people (and all people) want to laugh and have a good time.

2018-02-04T19:51:23,"Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this movie was definitely not role model cool. If anything, Denzel's portrayal of Troy Maxson was that of a self centered arrogant jerk. And although Viola Davis mentioned that her role in this film elevates women, I am still scratching my head. If it's about income equality, yes, I agree. But Davis' portrayal of a faithful woman in the film despite Troy having an affair outside of the marriage sort of put women in the stone age. It's as if a woman's role is to accept a man's deficiencies when they occur right in your face. And yes, I get that a lot of women cheat on men during marriages too - no one is perfect. But being specific about this movie, it makes black women in general appear to be at the lowest level on the evolution hierarchical human chain.",0,0,Todd Sands,jj-ZYPVRQbc,0.2019047619047619,2018-02-04 19:51:23,False,False

I understand people have both positive and negative traits and gaining empathy for the terrible life experiences this man had helps you to forgive and love him despite bad behavior. In addition, he was a good provider. But he was NOT a good father or husband and he did not care. He was controlling more than loving. I saw no concern on his part for how others felt or what they wanted. I still have a hard time thinking this sends a good message to women. For her to stay with him when he informed her how it would be ...that he would continue his affair...and then foist his problem on her....not a good role model.  I understand she was financially dependent, that she loved him, and that she wanted to care for the child. But I would not sleep with him, cook for him, clean his house, or even talk to him. He would be INFORMED of my rules. If his choice was to not come home and not be present, then my job would be to control the money and to care for the child. PERIOD.
