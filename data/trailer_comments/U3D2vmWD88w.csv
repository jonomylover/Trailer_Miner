When Alita (Rosa Salazar) awakens with no memory of who she is in a future world she does not recognize, she is taken in by Ido (Christoph Waltz), a compassionate doctor who realizes that somewhere in this abandoned cyborg shell is the heart and soul of a young woman with an extraordinary past. As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious history while her street-smart new friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) offers instead to help trigger her memories. But it is only when the deadly and corrupt forces that run the city come after Alita that she discovers a clue to her past ‚Äì she has unique fighting abilities that those in power will stop at nothing to control.

2018-11-14T05:52:14,I'm a little scared of this. I have seen how hollywood changes original source materials in order to suit their own narratives and this story looks to be no different. The problems that we see here are kind of obvious. This is going to be a story of self discovery and loving some boy and becoming a female audience proxy. The anime centers around and unachievable goal of making a better lives for themselves by making their way to the city in the sky. The manga applies a much broader understanding of what the manga was trying to convey. Neither properties seem to be properly represented in this movie. So I will wait for the reviews.

It should've been more mature by having a kid robot having to deal that he wasn't real and that his father hated him...god I hate Hollywood, but this time they're giving James Cameron a chance to prove that Anime adaptations can be good, if not, even greater. Robert Rodriguez isn't really my favourite director anymore, but it's good to see that he's taking lessons from James Cameron.

So, how can she have lain dormant, in a trash heap, with no digestive system, no food for said system, to feed her organic brain?   Because, she's NOT a Cyborg. She has to have an artificial brain, that runs on stored electrical current. She is an ""it"", an Android, in order to be deactivated/dormant for so long. She could have been fully human at one time, and in some circumstance had her mind/memories/essence transferred to this ""brain"", making her a she, maybe.
