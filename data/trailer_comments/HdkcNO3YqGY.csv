I shouldve learned my lesson and not gotten excited for his new form, especially with the extreme disapointment of ""Super Saiyan God"" a.k.a Kaioken Times 1,000,000. Like a recolor...realy? Ok whatever. So he becomes like super saiyan color, Frieza becomes the monkey that he so very much hates....whatever. Im just disappointed. I didnt like battle of gods at all, and i had high hopes for htis movie, now im goin in with low expectations so hopefully ill like it cause my extremely low and negative outlook on this movie will be surpassed. He did say a looong time ago and recently that Super Saiyan was upposed to be the pinnacle of strength and he regrets creating ss2 and 3 and all that, but for ppl that grew up with DBZ that was amazing. And because of that statement, its probably the reason ssg was a recolor, and now friezas new form is just a recolor. I was hoping maybe he'd look something like coolers final form but better, but obviously Toriyama is walking down a road of whta hes always wanted dbz to be, and id be fine with that if the new stuff wasnt stupid. Whatever though, i hope this movie will be good, cause if not im just gonna continue to say dbz from raditz to Buu is amazing and pretend battle of ass and return of friezas ass dont exist.",0,2,toooop9,HdkcNO3YqGY,0.09928986838077748,2015-03-03 03:58:16,True,True

His golden recolor is all im going off off, but if you've read the 1st part chapter, he's deff. aware he isnt 'the shit', like he did during namek. and understands he needs to train- but  realizing that super saiyans may be one of the strongest things in the universe(for defeating buu and being afraid of buu), his only option to defeating them, would be to become 'like' one.

This would give Goku motivation to kill Frieza as well.  -We clearly see Future Trunks killing Frieza and in the manga that has been released Frieza says he want's revenge on both of the saiyans who beat him(Goku and Trunks). With Frieza's new form Goku is evenly matched with him while Vegeta is utterly outclassed and afraid of Frieza's new power. While this is happening Goten and Trunks(present) arrive to assist in fighting Frieza's army since you know there is a thousand of them. After seeing Trunks Frieza believes it is the same one and moves into kill him. At this point Frieza offers to spar Trunks if Vegeta rejoins him as his servant. Vegeta does so and joins Frieza in the fight against Goku. Now The New God Frieza and Vegeta beat Goku(would explain Vegeta looking down angrily looking down at the beaten Goku with his back to a laughing Frieza.) and prepare to destroy the Earth however Beerus and Whis jump in and finish off what is left of Frieza's army and Beerus fights both Frieza and Vegeta while Whis restores Goku to full power and asks him to assist Beerus so he doesn't get carried away. Goku now enraged of Vegeta's betrayal and having just learned of Gohan's death powers back up to SSJG and smashes Vegeta and takes over for Beerus and with Beerus they together kill God Frieza. Vegeta is left in a broken state and everyone is ashamed of him for siding with Frieza with his friendship with all of them being strained as well.

He was gathering energy of the other saiyans) ascending to the rank of Super Saiyan God to partake in a battle to the death with Frieza so he finishes him off once and for all, avenging his entire race, restoring his pride and being a fucking bad ass.",0,0,Olkard,HdkcNO3YqGY,-0.1483974358974359,2015-03-03 16:48:32,True,True

If goku and others can get stronger with seemingly no effort (looking at all the transformations, fusions, namek fusing, and all that power level BS), then why cant Frieza do the same? and heck, its actually belieable, that he trains to achieve new powers, just like our heroes done billions of time before, so it inst impossible.  At first, i also thought his new form is lame as heck, and desing wise, it is, then thinking again... now he actually looks like cooler.... so cooler's previous form was like Frieza's then current final form.... so Frieza can still have form(s) even further?  plus, frieza as character and villain is simple and entertaining and i defninedly am gonna check this movie out.

None of the villains in the series looked all that impressive in terms of size and image, but boy were they powerful! Frieza, Cell, Buu,ect, the Z warriors would always comment on how weak they looked, but they always got their asses handed to them! Hell, even Beerus himself looks unintimidating! The same goes for this movie. Sure Friezas ne form doesnt look much different and monsterous, but his POWER increased beyond imagining! You saw for yourself in the trailer, Goku got his ass whipped, and it takes MASSIVE amounts of power for that to happen! Even god-like power like in the last movie! Thats what its all about, you dont have to look strong to BE strong! So please, stop bitching about the form, and get hyped for the AWESOME battle ahead! My hype level is over 9000!

2015-03-04T16:58:17,Frieza's new form really needs some work. It just looks bad. Its just recolour of Cooler. The gold simply doesn't go with the purple skin. It just looks ugly. Perhaps if they added a 3rd colour into the colour scheme it might look better. I understand the symbolism of the gold plating but that's pointless if the character looks ridiculous.  My high hopes are now on Vegeta. I'm calling it right now. Vegeta will turn into a blue SSJG and defeat Frieza. However there's one thing we have to consider for the next movie after this one.

2015-03-04T18:53:05,"@TragedyStrikes(can't comment on my own post for some reason) No superiority approach. Just trying to show the flaw in your stinky logic. If you didn't read my book, then go read it. It has a lot of valuable information on it.   Yeah, you tried way too hard on this, and the end result wasn't beneficial for you. I don't know how you got the ""and now"" mixed up. You obviously did it to twist my words, but that's fine, I still forgive you. ""And now"" means that Freeza has been changed to look like an exact copy of his brother's original form (the one we first see), only a different colour. Why did I write this, you may ask? Simple, you foolish duck! Because he looks exactly like Cooler, only painted a different colour (and here's the kicker) DESPITE STATING TO HAVE A TRANSFORMATION. Cooler's 4th form (which would be the equivalent to Freeza's 4th form) looks similar to Freeza's ""final form"", but there are certain differences that a monkey could tell the difference. Cooler's 5th form changed him completely. Freeza's ""transformation"" didn't change him, it only painted him a different colour. Basically, what I'm saying is that there's a difference between looking similar, and looking like a 99% copy, only a different colour. This has nothing to with them being siblings (obviously, I know they would have to look the same, because they're siblings). Here, I'll make it more simple for you, whore:   Freeza's final form (4th form)/ Cooler's 4th form (initial form we see on the big screen [that is, if you even have a big screen. I got a 72' plasma ACDC TV, with NOS, and a camshaft exhaust that would put your brick TV to shame, son.]}= roughly the same (due to being siblings), but having minor differences.   Cooler's 5th form (final form)/Freeza's ""new transformation""= Cooler having an actual new form, whereas Freeza changed to look exactly like his older brother, only painted differently.   Did you get that? Take some, call your parents, hire a tutor, etc...If you still can't grasp my ""superior"" knowledge, and then come back for some more training, asshopper.   *""You're complaining that SSG looks too much like Kaoken despite transformations before looking similar (which you oh so gracefully ignored).""*  I stated to many people that's that what I see. SSJ wasn't as creative, but for the time it came out, it was a big change. This is a 20+ year-old character, who finally gets a new transformation, only to have him painted gold. Wow, look at the creativity in that. Deviant Art's been doing a much better job. So, no, I didn't ignore them, you just didn't read my books I published in the comments above. If you'd like, I can wire you some Zenny to hire that tutor. I want you to grow big and strong, and become smart, like the 235+ people who agreed with me that this ""transformation"" is shit.   The rest was insults, so here's one for you:   Riddle me here, riddle me there, who just got destroyed, and looked foolish?

It's not a transformation, just like mystic gohan is NOT a transformation. Goku doesn't even have the ''God transformation'' anymore. He absorbed most, if not all, into his base power. That's why you do not see the red ki anymore. That was just a moment to display he became a Saiyan god at that moment. As you can see in this trailer, he has regular white ki.   To be honest, I really enjoy what they're doing. All those silly forms and stuff and people expecting extreme over the top transformations is just insane. Why would you even want that? I love the subtle forms. Freeza's colouring could've been done differently, but he should not have had a new transformation. Why? Because his race uses transformations to supress power, not gain it. Freeza's ''final form'' is actually his actual regular form. This ''form'' is just a recolouring of that final form that he's supposed to look like.  You people know nothing about dbz.

An evil grin crossed Frieza's face just as he began to question as to how that would be possible to which Jafar chuckled i will tell you all about it if you do one little favor for me.

Jafar clenched his fists you see their is a wretched street rat named Aladdin and a princess of heart named Jasmine who between the two of them always found a way to throw the rug over my plans to acquire the kingdom of Agrabah. I could have easily vanquished them both but you see they had help from that wretched boy Sora and his meddlesome keyblade. To which Frieza chuckled oh dear after all that they get a happy ending well an injustice like that must be corrected immediately and I know just the thing. I just can’t wait to see the looks on their faces when they meet yours truly and only then will they know the wrath of Frieza. Jafar responded your a genius the Revival of F is at hand its a dang shame that Maleficent isn't here right now I bet she would really take a liking to you. Frieza smiled a guess Maleficent's reputation precedes her and it should after all she is my loving mother. Jafar stated what a small realm this is and then told Frieza the only way Frieza could ever defeat Goku is to gather the black star dragon balls and wish to become an all powerful Genie.

2015-03-08T23:53:56,"I think this movie will make me feel some mixed feelings. We will get to see the Z warriors actually kicking some butt for once. I didn’t notice this before, but we will also see Piccolo and Gohan get owned by one of Freiza Henchmen. My money is that it is a transformed Sorbet.  I originally felt that Gohan would defeat Sorbet and get Knocked out by Freiza, but that battle may go a bit different now. Gohan went Super Saiyan in this movie, most likely because his power kept decreasing to the point he needs to use it again to remain relevant. I don’t think Vegeta will finish off Freiza, which will disappoint many fans. He will help, but I am not sure he will get the satisfying killing blow. We have not seen Goku fight Freiza in Super Saiyan form for some reason. You would think he would have transformed into a Super Saiyan after witnessing his power, but ok. We don’t know what Vegeta and Freiza battle is going to look like.  I had many other opinions, but actually watching and paying attention to the new movie trailer, I am not so sure anymore. Another concern of mine will Vegeta actually gets to go Super Saiyan God. The requirements are five Saiyan transfer their powers into one body, but everyone kind of look busy.

Freiza's 4th forth was ""Perfection"" in his eyes. He was slim, no humps, and fast. This new form he is a little more muscular but he looks more mature. Thats how i see it.

I'm perfectly fine with the new Frieza look as long as the storyline fits and makes sense, I don't need to him to go all Cooler like with his new transformation. Simplicity is the way to go after years of crazy transformations in the series. Be grateful that the guy is at least willing to revive the series through movies, don't complain and whine. My ONLY problem is the fact that funimation takes so damn long to acquire the rights to dub the film. Its released everywhere else on the same date, and I would love for funimation to follow that process so that fans in the US don't have to wait almost two years for a dub.  This is why a new series is a horrible idea, because the fans will always just bitch about how this is too simple, this is too complex, this is too this, too that. SSG was fine too, but you guys probably wanted some crazy purple blue orange mix colored ssj3 style hair. This looks promising, especially with the role that Vegeta is gonna play.

2015-03-22T00:11:52,"Man, this'll be awesome. I have some questions but I'm sure they'll be answered once I can watch the movie.  1.) After all the hype of SSJGod and ""god power"" in general, it's rather amazing and weird for me to see Frieza attain that level of power. I'm gonna rationalize it this way; There are certain species that have the potential to attain god power. The ones we've seen are Beeris' race, Whis' race, Saiyans and apparently Frieza's race. If the existence of a god of destruction is the way of the universe, then logically organisms that can BE that god must exist. Just like Goku attained god power through accessing SSJGod mode, Frieza's race manifests god power in that gold transformation like SSJGod was red. It would explain why Beerus would be so concerned with Frieza.  2.) Despite this, how could Goku be defeated so handily? From what we see in this video, Goku pushes Frieza to go into his god mode and it appears that Goku hung with it for some time before Frieza finally overwhelmed him. However, when Goku fought Beerus as a SSJGod the form eventually ran out. His body surpassed the limit and was able to contend with Beerus after. He went SSJ during the fight to continue. In interviews Toriyama said he'll do away with the extra SSJ forms like SSJ2-3, making the characters concentrate more on mastering base SSJ state. Considering this, Goku would've likely trained to that principle and he can still transform just as he did with Beerus. That means the base Goku should still be of godly power and going SSJ would only multiply his power YET we see that he never went SSJ, he stuck to base form. Hopefully this is explained because SSJ is still a thing in Battle of Gods and he should be able to defeat Frieza's gold form with it no problem, considering he fought with the gold form in his own base form before being defeated.

I want to see Vegeta fight Freeza while round 2 of Beerus vs Goku goes down..... by the way if any of you haven't noticed Freeza looks like he actually took quite a considerable amount of damage fighting Son before Vegeta steps in from the clips. This looks like a reversal of what happened on Namek but Freeza takes some damage this time. I look forward to seeing Vegeta take over this fight but I agree with most here that it's not in Son to just lay on the ground while they fight so they will have him doing something else maybe Beerus on earth is a little hint to what Son will be doing lol. Oh and please lay off the Gohan thing already yes we all know he has the ""potential"" to surpass all the Saiya-jin but that does not mandate that he will we all know people that can do things but don't have potential but don't utilize or fulfill that potential it depends on their personality and Gohan is not a fighter so to speak he more or less dreamed of being a Sentai hero hence his Saiya man get up.... the 2 times his power surpassed everyone's he let his guard down with Cell he became arrogant got his father killed with Buu he let his guard down and everyone was absorbed and got his ass kicked by Super Buu.

2015-03-25T21:55:14,"People don't like the idea of Vegeta being able to do what Goku cannot, simply due to the element of Goku being a unique Saiyan with powers achievable through morally pure means, where Vegeta was a self-concerned Saiyan Prince, humbled by a ""low class"" subordinate. He (Vegeta) was proven to not be as powerful as his title suggests because the old-world Saiyan hierarchy is no longer relevant; the new-world Saiyan line-up are based on Earth, and protecting it is now what defines their people.  Vegeta has the chance now to surpass Goku if need-be, because he has a stake in the planet Earth, as well as facing the man who killed his people. The accumulation of destroying Planet Vegeta (which was not relevant to Goku as he never knew it as his home), as well as the threat on Earth all amounts to Fireza's presence before Vegeta. Frieza seeks to eradicate Vegeta's new planet, but now that he truly has something to defend (his family, his allies, and his home), the stakes are raised, and Vegeta has the opportunity not only to avenge his people once and for all, but save Earth from the same fate.  That's called a story arc, and would probably best-suit the film's narrative.

2015-04-01T21:01:28,People with the ''Vegeta needs to be the hero'' BS are getting incredibly annoying to me as a DB fan. Every video about Revival of F is about Vegeta this Vegeta that. THIS IS GOKU's show. The rest are supporting characters. Goku is the main character. Don't make us hate Vegeta by forcing this sh1t over us. I started watching this show back with Dragon Ball as kid Goku and his journey with growing supporting characters and now people want Vegeta to be on Goku's level... STFU. Goku will always be superior. In Battle of Gods they forced this sh1t on us by making base SSJ Vegeta go above Goku simply because Bulma got b1tchslapped which made no sense or logic at all. Goku needed help and he barely scratched the surface of SSJ God and now Vegeta becomes one just like that  when Goku is so far and above the rest of the supporting cast ? F THAT. Vegeta is getting TOO MUCH screen time if you ask me while Gohan a great character is being butchered. No one is saying or wanting Gohan to be above Goku but he had so much potential to be at least the 3rd strongest character but they made him a total joke. But no Vegeta who is already getting so much screen time needs moar right ? Btw Goku didn't save sh1t in BOTG 1 he got his ass handed to him. It was basically a 1 way traffic. But you want Vegeta to be the main guy and you dare call yourselves DB fans. Yeah DBZ perhaps. /rant.,0,0,Ty Alex,HdkcNO3YqGY,0.016761904761904752,2015-04-01 21:01:28,True,True

2015-04-02T18:58:12,"FINALLY GUYS Detailed Summary of Revivial of F. Down in Hell, a gaggle of cute angels and stuffed animals crowd around a lone tree in a verdant field. Encased in a pod suspended from the tree’s branches is Freeza, looking thoroughly displeased. Sorbet, the de facto leader of Freeza’s remaining forces, reluctantly orders their withdrawal from Planet 448 as the inhabitants rebel. He inquires of his soldiers’ progress in locating the Namekians’ new planet, but in spite of their many spy robots, they have found nothing. In disgust, he orders Tagoma, his top lieutenant, to accompany him to Earth to return Lord Freeza to life! From orbit, Sorbet and Tagoma see that someone besides “that woman” can collect Dragon Balls, and this group already has six! Bringing the Pilaf Trio aboard, the group goes on to obtain the seventh ball at the bottom of the ocean. Elsewhere, Piccolo is babysitting an infant Pan in front of Mr. Satan’s mansion, rocking her cradle with his foot. Videl and Gohan apologize for being late as Piccolo acts embarrassed. He suddenly notices an unusual ki in the distance. In a rocky, barren landscape, Sorbet orders Pilaf to summon Shenlong, and orders that Lord Freeza be returned to life! Though Shenlong initially resists reviving a chopped-up body, the minions go through with it anyway. Freeza’s body lands in a pile of chunks in front of them. The Dragon then demands a second wish, so Shuu hastily wishes for one million zenny. The Dragon takes its leave, leaving Sorbet and Tagoma to collect the pieces of Freeza before departing. Freeza pieces himself back together in a healing chamber on Sorbet’s ship. Freeza emerges in his first form, surveying his surroundings. Sorbet hastily introduces himself, as do his lieutenants Tagoma and Shisami, who Sorbet claims are equal in ability to the late Zarbon and Dodoria. Sorbet suggests reviving his father as well, but Freeza refuses, citing “Papa’s” egotism. After killing a random minion and grousing about the state of his own power, Freeza says it will take some time before his revenge. Tagoma attempts to reason with him, suggesting that it would be wiser to simply ignore the Saiyans; Freeza lifts him up telekinetically, then tosses him through the viewport into space. Soldiers are sucked out into the vacuum, as Sorbet orders the shields raised. Sorbet attempts to explain that Son Goku has become much, much stronger since their last encounter, but in spite of this massive power-up, Freeza, who has never trained before in his life, believes that if he trains for a few months, he will be able to surpass even that Saiyan…! After a brief argument with a Capsule Corporation receptionist, Jaco, a member of the Galactic Patrol, is able to meet up with his old friends Dr. Brief and Bulma. Jaco says he’s heard that she was friends with the one who defeated Freeza… who has been revived, and is on his way to Earth with a thousand soldiers! Bulma attempts to summon Whis through a strawberry sundae offering, but when nothing happens, she decides to let everyone know about the situation herself. Kuririn’s arrest of two thugs is interrupted by a call from Bulma. He hurries home to prepare, where he puts on his dōgi, and gets No. 18 to shave his head. He tells his wife and daughter to stay safe. As he flies away, No. 18 whispers, “So cool….” Goku and Vegeta are sparring against Whis. While both appear to be going all-out, neither is able to touch him, and when they attempt to attack in tandem, they merely get in each other’s way. Both are thinking before they attack; they need to let their bodies take the initiative and act. Vegeta is always tense and slow to react, while Goku is too relaxed and open to attack. At this point, Beerus appears: he can’t get any sleep with that racket going on. He sneezes, and sends an energy ball hurtling towards a nearby planet, which explodes. Whis complains about the time that he had to fix Beerus’ destruction of several nearby suns. Goku is surprised, and asks if Whis can create worlds, but Whis says he can merely rewind time a bit and do things over. Vegeta asks what he is; Whis supposes he is… a life-form called “Whis”. Back on Earth, Freeza’s ship arrives, and troops spill out. Earth’s fighters can feel Freeza’s ki and head in that direction, but not before he, as a greeting, obliterates North City with a single blast. Gohan purposely avoided telling Goten and Trunks about the impending fight because the two of them might do something rash. Freeza notices the heroes, and singles out the one he remembers killing on Namek. A spaceship arrives and Bulma hops out. She wastes no time in unloading a verbal barrage on Freeza, who responds asking where Son Goku is. She engages in provocation until Kuririn points out to her that Freeza has in fact gotten much, much stronger, like he’s a different person. She quickly changes her tune and asks for Freeza to wait until Son-kun shows up, but when Freeza gives only 10 seconds, she unloads on him again. Freeza unleashes his army, while each hero is forced to engage multiple enemies at a time. Freeza dryly notes that Earth’s fighters are intentionally avoiding killing their foes. As the crowd of soldiers thins, Piccolo is taken on directly by Shisami, who proves a more formidable challenge than the others. Gohan steps in, however, and makes quick work of him after becoming a Super Saiyan. Sorbet is horrified, and Freeza says he didn’t know how truly fearsome a Super Saiyan was. Earth’s fighters take a senzu each to recover from their fight. Freeza laments the pitiable state of his forces, as one soldier apologizes for being no match for the Earthlings. Freeza comments that their lying around like that is an eyesore, and dispatches them all in an instant. Freeza eyes Gohan and knocks him down with a single blast. Kuririn panics when he realize that Gohan has no pulse. There’s no way for him to eat a senzu like this, either…! Piccolo uses a kiai as a form of chest-compression which gets Gohan’s heart beating and enables him to down the second-to-last senzu. The Oracle Fish shows up to tell Whis that there was a message for him earlier. Whis is excited at the thought of there being something tasty waiting for him, but his joy is quickly interrupted by Bulma shouting at him for not getting back earlier and that Freeza has returned. Whis notes that it would take 35 minutes, but Bulma interrupts to tell Goku to just teleport there already! Goku tells Vegeta to hurry up and grab his hand, which flusters him. Goku reminds him that if they don’t hurry, Bulma might get killed, and he reluctantly puts his hand in Goku’s. The two of them disappear from Beerus’ planet. Goku teleports to Earth, and Vegeta hastily lets go of his hand. Freeza speaks of his suffering in Hell, but at last the day of his revenge has arrived. He can’t bear the thought of Son Goku alive, to the point that he trained for the first time in his life. Goku says his power has indeed increased, but he himself has also gotten a lot stronger. Freeza acknowledges that he was caught a bit off-guard, but no matter: this time, he will start fighting right in his final form! Goku is impressed, and comments that if Freeza weren’t such an evil guy, he’d make a good rival. This just annoys Freeza even further. After a moment, he also expresses his confusion at Goku’s lack of a Super Saiyan transformation. Goku responds that he does not need to. The two clash, and while the fighting is fierce, it becomes clear to the others that Freeza hasn’t landed a single hit. Freeza who attacks with a renewed ferocity. However, Goku is not seriously perturbed, and Vegeta starts to get annoyed. Eventually, he flies up to where the two are fighting… and starts fighting against Goku, shouting for him to give him a turn instead. Freeza, misunderstanding the situation, assumes Vegeta still has a bit of loyalty to him, and tells the Saiyan prince to stand back to let him have his vengeance. Vegeta grudgingly obliges, and Goku and Freeza pause their fight. Freeza is impressed that Goku has improved this much, even if it took him quite a while. Goku senses that Freeza is still hiding something, and Freeza expects the same of him. They agree not to hold back any longer, and Goku goes first, warning Freeza that he won’t want to fight anymore once he sees it. He concentrates, and his hair stands on end as he is enveloped by an ethereal blue aura. Goku says it’s hard to explain, but basically it’s Super Saiyan with the power of Super Saiyan God. Freeza is glad, then, that he decided to attempt attaining a further transformation. Freeza concentrates, and powers up a great deal, surrounding himself in a blinding light. Freeza acknowledges the cheap name, but refers to it as “Golden Freeza” anyway. Goku is impressed, but it also makes him excited. Goku offers to let Vegeta fight now, but he nervously declines, saying that Freeza’s opponent is Kakarrot. The battle begins in earnest this time, and is much more evenly matched than before. Beerus notes that Vegeta isn’t fighting together with Goku, and that the two of them are just too proud. Beerus calls them both fools, which Whis says is just like the God himself. As he begins to lose the battle, Goku compliments how amazing Freeza is, to have come so far when it took him so long to get this strong. Freeza is apparently tickled by this, but says it won’t do him any good. It is then, however, that Freeza notices the presence of Beerus, who complains that Freeza is going to get dust all over the food if he doesn’t fight somewhere else. Goku thinks Freeza should quit while he’s ahead and go home: after all, they’ve spotted his weak point. Freeza is incredulous, but Vegeta pointedly explains that Freeza, consumed with the idea of revenge, probably came to Earth as soon as he achieved his “Golden Freeza” form. He hasn’t had time to get used to it, so it’s rapidly consuming his strength. After holding him under water for a bit, Freeza sends a volley of energy blasts after Goku, who manages to evade or deflect them all. Finally, Freeza manages to land a solid punch directly to Goku’s face… but Goku is completely unfazed. Finally, Goku launches a massive Kamehameha at Freeza, which he attempts to repel with a blast of his own. It is no use, however; the tyrant is utterly defeated. As Goku stands above him, Freeza hauls himself up on the water’s edge, erupting in rage and humiliation… followed by a smirk. Just then, a bolt of energy comes from behind Freeza and pierces Goku straight through the heart: it was Sorbet with his ring. Freeza then takes out his pent-up rage on Goku, kicking and stomping on his chest repeatedly. Freeza gloats over Goku’s softness, mocking the “bad habit” of letting down his guard that left even his powerful body vulnerable to a mere beam attack. Freeza offers to let Vegeta have the final blow against the Saiyan he hates. Vegeta flies over, calling Goku an idiot for not listening to Whis’ warnings. However, he also refuses to kill him, saying that as much as Goku pisses him off, he needs him around for his own purposes. Freeza attempts to sweeten the deal, by offering to make Vegeta the supreme commander of his forces. However, Vegeta chooses instead to utterly obliterate Freeza. There’s no way he’d have any loyalty to the one who destroyed Planet Vegeta! Vegeta tells Kuririn to give Kakarrot the last senzu, or else he’ll die. Kuririn does so, but Freeza tries to interfere, sending energy blasts towards them. However, Vegeta deflects them away, and one ends up killing Sorbet in a fitting comeuppance. Goku thanks Vegeta for saving him; Vegeta scoffs, and says in exchange, he’ll be taking the best part of the fight. Vegeta powers up, and reveals that he can also use the form Goku demonstrated earlier. Freeza freaks out, and unleashes a torrent of energy blasts at Vegeta, but to no avail. What follows is a one-sided beating in which Freeza is humiliated even further, to the point that he even loses his much-vaunted “Golden” form. Back in his fourth form, he pounds against the ground in despair. Standing before Freeza, Vegeta prepares to deliver the final blow… Freeza sends a ball of energy straight into the ground below him. The Earth’s crust cracks and distorts, revealing magma underneath that rushes to the surface. Earth is engulfed in fire, and explodes in a giant shockwave. Only Beerus, Whis, and those near them survive the destruction, thanks to Whis’ barrier. Goku laments not finishing Freeza off when he had the chance. “In that case… why don’t you?” asks Whis, as Beerus tells Goku it was his softness that invited Freeza’s victory. Goku asks what Whis means, and he responds that he will be turning back time. Goku had best hurry, as he can only go back three minutes. He taps his staff twice on the ground, and the events are undone. Once again, Freeza is on his hands and knees, with Vegeta preparing to deal the final blow. As Freeza shouts his retort, Goku screams “FREEZA!” and hits him full-force with a massive Kamehameha. Freeza screams in defeat as his body is completely disintegrated. The moment of relief is broken by Vegeta shouting at Kakarrot for stealing the coup de grâce out from under him. Goku apologizes as Vegeta chews him out for not switching out like he said he would, but Bulma tells him it’s all right, and that Son-kun actually saved him. Vegeta demands an explanation. Beerus says it’s unbecoming for a God of Destruction to restore a planet, but Bulma says that as thanks, she’ll prepare them a feast… as soon as they restore North City with the Dragon Balls, that is. Whis is pleased. Bulma asks Jaco if it’s really all right for him not to be arresting Whis, since control over time is a serious offense. Even after having things explained to him, Vegeta is less than pleased. Goku tries to add that, like Whis said, if they’d simply fought together from the beginning, none of that would have happened in the first place. Vegeta refuses point blank, saying he’d never do that. Goku laughs and says he feels the same way. Vegeta notes it’s the first time they’ve shared the same opinion on something. After the credits, the angels and stuffed toys in Hell gather around the tree, shouting “Welcome back!” Freeza is back where he started, suspended once more in his pod.",0,0,BEEFV,HdkcNO3YqGY,0.1146040263748597,2015-04-02 18:58:12,True,True

This guy was beating the whit out of Goku before he turned kaioken x3. The. In the Friza saga since Goku was still injured at the time we had more Vegeta in namek (and yes Gohan and Krillin too but forget this im talkin about Vegeta) than Goku being in a hospital until he arrived. Vegeta had a major powerup in the cell saga surpassing Goku at least for a day and was beating the shit outta cell till he recklessly let him live. Gohan got ssj2 and recklessly let Cell live too (cell is on lucky bastard) during the kamehameha clash Vegeta was the one who helped Gohan the most in finishing off Cell. Goku goes super saiyan 2. Majin Vegeta beats him. Goku goes super saiyan 3 (it's still questionable if he coulda have) doesn't beat majin Buu. Goku fights Beerus for the first time. Gets fucked up. For the rest of that time we don't know what the hell Goku is doing while we get some more Vegeta time as he tries to keep Beerus hay till he's forced to fight him and withstand Beerus' attacks longer than Goku did and actually punched him (but to be fair Goku was pressure pointed much like Vegeta did at the end and Vegeta was going full on rage mode). Goku goes super saiyan God. Doesn't beat Beerus. You see Goku doesn't take at least *all* the glory. But why even complain about that? He's been our protagonist ever since the beginning.

The voices like in the trailer would just make me want to laugh and turn it off early, due to the squeaky nature of like Goku for example. The cell saga at least had people be more serious in their fighting and the comedy was not in so many awkward spots. Minus some of the Hercule moments. Even DB had some serious parts in it, where battles were quite rough. Goku had his time in DB and DBZ. We need Vegeta being the main hero. Also for the upcoming dbz rebirth series, we need other characters to shine against main villains. Almost had hope for Tien in dbz but yet he didn't finish off a main villain. We all know how weak Yamcha ended up being. Maybe we should see a series with the past Saiyan Race in it before they meet Frieza. Also have it showing grandpa Gohan when he was younger, along with Master Roshi before he became a major pervert. I see this movie as a ""hey Frieza appears to be the most popular villain, so let's make more money by bringing him back"" type of movie. Frieza's fear hold was lost when creator had him die easily by future trunks and how Frieza's dad didn't put up any real fight. That's his father he came from, you'd think he would be stronger or as strong as Frieza. The creator got ahead of himself too fast towards the end of DBZ.

2015-05-16T21:44:13,"Peace has returned to Earth following the battle with God of Destruction Beerus in the previous movie. With their power dwindling due to the absence of their leader, the remnants of Frieza's army are led by an alien named Sorbet, who decides to revive their master. He then sets off to Earth with one other minion, Tagoma, where they convince Emperor Pilaf, Mai, and Shu, who have collected the Dragon Balls to let them summon Shenron instead. As Shenron is unable to fully revive Frieza, he brings him back to life in pieces, and his minions put him together using their advanced technology. As soon as Frieza's body is regenerated, he emerges in his first form and announces to his soldiers that he will not be satisfied until Goku and Future Trunks have both been killed. Tagoma then says that Frieza should just ignore Goku and the other Saiyans, then Frieza angrily kills Tagoma with a quick Ki blast. Sorbet informs Frieza that Goku's power has surpassed that of even Majin Buu, which is far more than Frieza could have ever imagined. But due to him being a prodigy, Frieza states that through several months of serious training, he would be able to unlock his dormant power and would wipe out the Saiyans in the blink of an eye.  Jaco the Galactic Patrolman travels to earth to warn Bulma that Frieza is approaching, and she gathers the Z Fighters to fight him. Gohan doesn't tell Goten and Trunks about the fight, because they might do something rash. Yamcha and Chiaotzu (who sensed Frieza's revival earlier) are asked by Tien to stay away from the fight as he fears that Frieza's new power may be too dangerous for them to handle. Majin Buu is also absent, for he is in a deep sleep. Goku and Vegeta are training on Beerus' planet with Whis, unaware that Frieza has been revived.  Gohan, Piccolo, Tien, Jaco, Krillin, and Master Roshi clash with an army of at least a thousand of Frieza's soldiers, led by Shisami. Frieza's power in his first form is said to be in a different league than the Z Fighters present on Earth, for he was able to knock out Gohan with a single blast.  Bulma's message eventually reaches Whis, and Goku and Vegeta travel back to earth to fight Frieza. Whis and Beerus join them in order to eat a strawberry-flavored dessert Bulma has prepared for them. Goku fights Frieza in his new ""Saiyan beyond God"" state and Frieza cannot win in his fourth form at full power. Goku then transforms into Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan and Frieza transforms into a new ""Golden Frieza"" form. Goku ultimately gains the upper hand, but he is blasted in the chest by Sorbet. Frieza stands over the incapacitated Goku and offers Vegeta a chance to kill Goku for him in exchange for his own life. Vegeta refuses and transforms into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan as well, much to Frieza's shock. Vegeta tells Krillin to revive Goku with a Senzu bean. As the latter moves to do so, Frieza attacks him, but Vegeta intercepts and deflects Frieza's attack towards Sorbet, which kills him. Vegeta attacks Frieza, eventually causing him to revert back to his fourth form, who then realizes that he cannot win. Frieza decides to destroy the planet, killing Vegeta in the process.  Earth is destroyed, but Whis creates a bubble around a small piece of rock to protect himself, Beerus, Bulma, Krillin, Gohan, Goku, Master Roshi, Piccolo, Tien and Jaco. While Bulma despairs, Goku expresses his regret that he didn't kill Frieza when he had the chance. Whis tells him that he has the power to set back time but only three minutes earlier. He does so, and they arrive back right before Frieza destroys the Earth. Goku immediately attacks with a God Kamehameha and kills Frieza.",0,0,BurnedPlantain,HdkcNO3YqGY,0.0649603756458595,2015-05-16 21:44:13,True,True

2015-05-27T14:15:17,"As other people have already written Frieza gaining such a crazy power up in just 4 months makes no sense. Frieza even stated that his power had diminished since he died to Goku & Trunks meaning his current power after being revived is less than it was when he got beaten. Also Goku's original super saiyan transformation when he fought Frieza was much weaker than it is now after all the training to make it feel natural to be in Super Saiyan form (yet was still enough to beat Frieza). Super Saiyan 3 is worlds apart from even upgraded super saiyan level and since then goku has been training non stop. He even became a god and his body remembered that feeling. Frieza was always my favourite villain in the dbz universe but this is too much. It would be cooler if he snuck into the hyperbolic time chamber and trained for 2 years or something like that, that would at least make more sense than 4 months. I already have a guess of how the films story will turn out, Goku will have an epic fight with the newly powered up Frieza but will get beaten, Vegeta will then go into God mode because he said in the battle of gods film next time it's my turn. He will still loose and Frieza will start laughing whilst charging up a huge energy attack to blow up the earth, everyone will give their remaining energy to Goku who will finish him with a massive Kamehameha or spirit bomb... Still really looking forward to it though :)",0,0,James,HdkcNO3YqGY,0.11567113442113443,2015-05-27 14:15:17,True,True
