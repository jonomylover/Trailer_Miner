John Paul Getty Jr. asked his father for the money, but was refused. In November 1973, an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear arrived at a daily newspaper. The second demand had been delayed three weeks by an Italian postal strike.The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid $3.2 million: ""This is Paul‚Äôs ear. If we don‚Äôt get some money within 10 days, then the other ear will arrive"" When the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to $3 million, Getty senior agreed to pay no more than $2.2 million‚Äîthe maximum that would be tax deductible. He lent his son the remaining $800,000 at 4% interest. Paul III was found alive in a filling station of Lauria, in the province of Potenza, shortly after the ransom was paid. After his release Paul III called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but Getty refused to come to the phone. Nine people associated with 'Ndrangheta were later arrested for the kidnapping, but only two were convicted. Paul III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Paul III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life.
