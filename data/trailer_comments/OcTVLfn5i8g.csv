The biggest step forward in authenticity I can see with the film makers is using Messiah's genuine Hebrew name of ""YESHUA"" over the greeco-roman jesus that was used from the 2nd century onwards by gentile christians.   Am hopeful they refer to the Jewish followers in this movie as Netzarim (ACTS 24:05) to increase authenticity further.  Although I did notice they put the ""Shroud of Turin"" event in the trailer, rather than the traditional burial robe of a Jewish ""Tallit gadol"" which christians call a ""napkin"" out of ignorance & wrong translation........

2015-05-18T15:58:34,"From: David Thorne Date: Thursday 11 March 2010 5.09pm To: Darryl Robinson Subject: Re: Re: Re: Re: Permission Slip  Dear Darryl, I understand the importance the resurrection story holds in your particular religion. If I too knew some guy that had been killed and placed inside a cave with a rock in front of it and I visited the cave to find the rock moved and his body gone, the only logical assumption would be that he had risen from the dead and is the son of God. Once, my friend Simon was rushed to hospital to have his appendix removed and I visited him the next day to find his bed empty. I immediately sacrificed a goat and burnt a witch in his name but it turned out that he had not had appendicitis, just needed a good poo, and was at home playing Playstation. Someone probably should have asked ""So the rock has been moved and he's gone... has anyone checked his house?"" I realize Playstation was not around in those days but they probably had the equivalent. A muddy stick or something. I would have said ""Can someone please check if Jesus is at home playing with his muddy stick, if not, then and only then should we all assume, logically, that he has risen from the dead and is the son of God."" If we accept though, that Jesus was the son of an Infinite Being capable of anything, he probably did have a Playstation. Probably a Playstation 7. I know I have to get my offspring all the latest gadgets. God would probably have said to him, ""I was going to wait another two thousand years to give you this but seeing as you have been good... just don't tell your mother about Grand Theft Auto."" Also, is it true that Jesus can be stabbed during a sword fight and be ok due to the fact that he can only die if he gets his head chopped off?

And you know what God was closed to the broken hearted, its the time of our vulnerabilty the his power works..I started to listen pastors from there preaches, they will explained verses that its hard to understand, I started to read a bible, beacause if theres inheritance that he left behind was the bible, on there was his journey, his life, his words , miracles and above all its where his life fully documented when he save us from sin.we have now a second chance fully paid by Jesus.take it.believe it. Its not enough that you just know him, you have to carved his name in your heart so when our time comes, its easy for us to enter the gates of heaven. Live life with Jesus, enjoy life with praising his glory, love him. I was once a person who aimed my problems to him, and I was wrong, so wrong and I asked for forgiveness.i never realized that during my darkest days he was still with me.i was just oblivious to the graces he graced upon me..before I  feel like I was on top of the tower, when I looked down was a bottomless pit that is waiting for me, but even with all of my problems, im still scared to do it so I turned my back away, facing the road that seems endless, living life with no meaning. Now everything was clear, its like the whole world is open for me, because I finally accepted him, raising my burdens to him, asking guidance from him.little by little I finally feel him in my heart.

This suicide is seen as the ultimate sacrifice and his suicide pays for the sins of all mankind - past present and future.  Interesting fact about the main character ( Jesus Christ) is that he is portrayed as a peace loving , kind , generous and tolerant person . A lesser known fact about the Jesus Christ character is that he murdered 25 million people in the old testament ( seeing that he is the Word and the Word became flesh).  So maybe all that suffering that he endured on the cross is payback for all the suffering he inflicted on mankind .

Holy fucking shit. I've never seen such repetitive retardation on only a movie trailer which is from an industry that sells historical and religious inaccuracy; always whites and blacks fighting over who is better while the rest of the world sits back and watches these two ethnic groups (yeah, because we're all one race -- just different ethnicities) battle it out since days long gone to prove who has more dominance.  Neither of you have a claim to a culture that isn't either of yours and is older than both. We all do have the same ancestors, however, and no one ethnicity is better than the other. So drop your age-old shit and remember that all those who are Christian are brothers and sisters in faith, no matter their ethnicity. The only one who has the right to judge us is God Himself.

2015-11-25T00:25:40,"The most terrifying thing in the world is that God  is good. Why? We are not good; we have sinned.  We have sinned by breaking God's law (the 10  Commandments) by lying, stealing, lusting, etc.  What does a good and holy God do with sinners?  He must punish us, just like an earthly judge  would rightly punish us for breaking earthly  laws.  The just punishment for breaking God's law is  death and an eternity in hell. How is that just?  Because God is infinite; therefore the punishment  of sinning against Him is equally as infinite. How  can anyone get to heaven? Only one way... If a  sinless person offered to take your punishment,  then justice would be served. That's exactly what  Jesus did!  Two thousand years ago, God the Son became a  man in Jesus Christ, came to earth, lived the  sinless life that none of us could and took the  penalty of our sins upon Himself, bearing God's  wrath on the cross. We broke God's law and  Jesus paid the fine. Then three days later, He rose  from the dead, showing the penalty was paid in  full. So what should you do?  God commands you to repent and trust in Jesus  ALONE for eternal salvation. Cry out to God for  mercy and put your faith in Jesus, confessing and  forsaking your sins. God will change your heart  so you will desire holiness.

God made everyone and everything we have or we wouldn't have it. There is a God A Son and Holy Ghost and these 3 are one. The Bible is all true. Our country was founded on God's Laws yes we are to have Godly men in power ones that follow God's word and rule with God's laws. That way we wouldn't be cheated out of our God given freedoms. We have had men in office that didn't and hasn't been Godly in their live and look what we have now children killing children. hate crimes. stealing drugs rape kidnapping sex gangs. sex trafficking of little boys and girls. Yes we need to go by that Old Black Book Called the Bible. We need God in our lives and if you don't know Jesus as your personal Savior you need to ask Jesus to come in to your live. It will change your life for the better. Stop all the talk about God not being real till you find out if God is Real ask Jesus to come in to your heart and really mean it. You will be changed. Because we are given a new body it's still flesh till we go to Heaven. Our way of thinking and doing things change inside of us. Then when you ask God to come in to you life and God is in your heart then you tell me how unreal God is then. You don't know Jesus if you say He don't exist. You will go to Hell for ever after you die. Hell is also A Real Place. I want that mansion Jesus said he was preparing for me for me to have forever.

2016-02-28T05:51:06,"The film seems designed to dismiss the idea of the Shroud of Turin being a miraculous image. With indifference to the fact, the film chalks up the image of Jesus on the Shroud as being a natural by-product of the inter-action between sweat and herbs. The protagonist of the film, the lead Roman Tribune, then begins a manhunt for the body of Jesus, suspecting his disciples stole the body. He then exhumes countless bodies of crucified victims buried in a common pit, in his search for Jesus' body. He examines a countless number of bodies, wrapped in burial shrouds but the fact not one of these shrouds bears image of the dead bodies they covered seems to escape the minds of the Roman Tribune and his soldiers. They fail to realize the Shroud of Christ was singularly unique in that it was the only shroud in the history of mankind to bear a bodily image. Which should tell you Jesus was indeed the Messiah.  The clueless film's director  had an opportunity to produce a film which could have centered around the mystery of the Shroud but instead, ignores it completely. To boot, the Shroud is grossly misrepresented in this film. The face on the shroud, as seen in the film, is not the same face we can see with the naked eye, which appears as a shadowy silhouette. The face seen in the film is the image of the invisible God, hidden beneath the Shroud's shadowy surface image. Also, the actor who plays Jesus later on in the film, looks nothing like the face of Christ on the Shroud. This was the slowest paced film I have ever seen. It was like Heinz ketchup turned upside down but with nothing flowing out. The film did not know where it wanted to go. Lack of a plot and the twisting of the New Testament account of Barabbas at the film's start told me this director did not know what he was doing. The lead actor in this film may not have realized it but this film is the bomb of the year and seems to only have been produced so that Sony Pictures could exploit the Easter season by raking in as much money as possible before the reviews kill this film.

2016-03-05T02:41:44,"I have something to say, the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to me. This happened when i decided to make the search for Him, for one year i cut off secular TV, and only watched TBN for entertainment. But that is not all, i woke up at 5 am, each day and sung praise songs, worshiped God/Jesus, then i prayed, read the Bible. And at 11pm i did the same, but i mostly just sung praise songs until i went to bed. I didn't realize that what i was doing was spending time with Jesus, having a relationship with Him as a friend. One day as i was singing, at around 11 pm, i opened my eyes to see the most friendliest, loving face i ever saw, it was Jesus and he was looking right into my eyes, his eyes were like if they were smiling and they appeared to actually express love.   His smile was perfect, and i have never seen a perfect smile like that, his teeth when he smiles are visible from end to end, his teeth are perfect. I mean when i saw His face, i was so amazed because there is no one i have ever seen, nor do i believe any person on the entire earth has such a heavenly face. But that is not all, i continued to do this more and more, since i had that encounter with Jesus Christ. One day i woke up and as i was just about to sit up on my bed i looked at my computer, and on the chair was someone who appeared to be like a spirit, he wore a robe and really old sandals, like the ones the Romans wear back in that era.   When i saw Him, i was so afraid and terrified, i couldn't move and was totally freaked out. He was there for about 10 seconds and then as he was coming toward me he disappeared right past me, and i was so afraid that i couldn't even turn my head to look. To be honest, it is not easy for the human eye to fathom a heavenly being, i knew on that day that Jesus sat there and he wanted me to see Him. On that day he didn't say a word, and also i could not see his face on that day, but i only saw from his shoulder on downwards, His face was there but i just couldn't see Him. It was an experience that i'll never forget, and i just wanted to share this with the world. I came to know that if you hear something, it is better for you to make the discovery before you start believing what the world says about something.   Many people do not even try to pray or spend time with Him, but they do take the Lords name and curse his name. This is not a way to make friends with anyone, and above all the whole world curses the Holy Trinity but they are blind, they do not realize that there is a reason for that curse, the evil one has implemented that so that you don't ever feel like inviting the Lord Jesus into your life. The evil one is clever, and this is the reason why people take the name of Jesus as a curse, because God said that we should love God with all our heart, mind and soul.   But the evil one knows that, so he implemented the use of taking the name of God/ Jesus/ Holy Spirit as a curse word. Remember that Loving God with your heart is the first commandment that was given to us, whey does the whole world curse God in every sentence we speak, realize that things are real, notice the game the evil one is playing on us, so that we end up like him, in hell.   He doesn't want us to have a relationship with Jesus Christ because he knows that when you come as far as i did and actually have an encounter with Jesus Christ then you will be forever changed. Be careful, and don't waste time and forget about Jesus because today i have testified to you that i have seen him, Jesus Christ exists and is alive. Make your own discovery, and believe for yourself, you have nothing to lose. I promise you that Jesus will prove himself to you just like he did to me, maybe not the same way but you will be amazed when you hear from Him. Believe me, it is not just the experience that is awesome, but Jesus also gives you peace, joy and happiness, not like you have experienced many times, but it is a different peace, joy, and happiness.   I'll tell about one crazy experience that i had when i was in the middle of praise and worship and the Lord gave me joy, it filled me up so much that i lost my breath for a while. I really couldn't breath and was gasping for air because i was suffocating on joy that the Lord was pouring in me. And yes, this joy/happiness was being poured into me, it was like a river and i was having too much of it.   But that is not why i think i was suffocating, i think that i was suffocating because my earthly body and spirit cannot contain the heavenly gifts, because i am still in human form. I really believe that on that day i go a glimpse of how i will be feeling in heaven when i get there, but for now i am limited to experience the full force of joy and happiness that my body can hold and maintain.   Also, on that day i understood that people who pass out in front of the church, or dance in a wild way or laugh uncontrollably, they are not faking it. They are experiencing something that is so much that i believe like in my case, one could die from experiencing this kind of joy/happiness.",0,0,4CCB C7,OcTVLfn5i8g,0.16898148148148143,2016-03-05 02:41:44,False,True

First off, when Jesus got baptized, God himself said from heaven, ""this is my ( son)"" (so unless Jesus pulled some ventriloquism act, it makes no sense). Second, what part of (no one) do you all not understand? The scripture tell us, (in more than just one book) that NO ONE has ever seen God and yet lived, so again, did people or did they not see Jesus? The answer should and is, very simple people. Yes they saw Jesus, so how can he be God? Also remember what Jesus himself said, ""I can do nothing on my own"" . Also, just what did he tell Satan when being tempted? Answer: Go away Satan, for it is written, that you must worship, God ALONE. (notice, he said God alone, he did not say worship him, nor the so called Holy Ghost. Throughout the bible, it states, that there is only one God, in fact, his name is YHWH, (Yaweh or Jehovah in English). His name is not, Jesus, or The Holy Ghost. Palms 83:18 States the Highest over all is Jehovah God. As you see, a different name, than Jesus or The Holy Ghost. Lastly, research the origin of the Trinity, it's a teaching that came AFTER the ORIGINAL scriptures were completed. It's so sad, that the church leaders rather hold onto tradition than tell the people the truth, that's one reason why God warned his people not to follow the TRADITIONS of the people from the nations. The religious leaders care more about traditional doctrine, than the truth, but the scriptures said that , that would happen.

2016-03-21T14:17:40,"MISSION OF JESUS CHRIST (PEACE BE UPON HIM)  Bismillahi Rahmani Raheem  The ‪#‎Salvation‬ which God Almighty Offered to the Children of Israel through His Chosen Servant Our Master Prophet Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) was not through his alleged claim of death on cross. The salvation was not offered by God through the so called death of Jesus Christ as a sacrifice in crucifixion. Rather, death (murder) or denial of Christ, which could possibly lead to his crucifixion, brings curse and disgrace to children of Israel, not Salvation at all. See John 8:21 Once more Jesus said to them, ""I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."" It is through accepting CHRIST and living according to his Teachings and complete Submission to the Will of God, which brings salvation. John 8:24 I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins."" So it is very clear that ""to believe in him and living by his Teachings Israelites will be saved"". Not through a Divine Pre-plan to sacrifice Christ on cross for the sins of mankind as an offering to fulfil the laws of Prophets and abolish the laws. Because abolishment of law is from Satan not from God. See 2 ‪#‎Thessalonians‬ 2:7-8-9 ""The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works"". ‪#‎Matthew‬ 13:41 The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness, One who understand the return of Christ to this world, will understand what we are saying. The old testament laws has its own requirements. There is no human sacrifice in it. Since Christ appointed as high priest and Prophet in the new Testament laws, it through accepting him as high priest and he becomes an intercessor (Waseela) for Jews and perform sacrifice at the Temple mount, he bring salvation to Jews. There is no laws in Old Testament which says to sacrifice of human for ‪#‎God‬. Some people bring up the incident of Prophet Abraham alaihiswalathu wa Salam and Ishmael (alaihissalam/Issac alaihissalam according to Jews and Christians) to justify this claim. But the truth is that there were no sacrifice of human then. Also it was not an atonement sacrifice which God Almighty ordered Prophet Abraham alaihissalam. It was only a trial for Prophet Abraham alaihissalam, to test his loyalty to God Almighty after receiving son in the old age. The old testament laws can't be fulfilled for whole world, because it is given to only children of Israel and those foreigners who reside among them. If Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) to be sacrificied Just to save Israelites, then the sacrifice has to be on the altar at the temple and high priest should perform it. Pagans (Romans) and Pharisees cannot be part of it. It was Sadducees who were high priests in that time. If Christ's (alaihissalam) covenant is a new covenant and have totally separated from old covenants, then it is a lie to say Christ is fulfilling old covenant. Because now it is new covenant that must be fulfilled.  So in the old covenant, only Aaron's descendants can be high priests and Jesus Christ peace be upon him not descendant of Aaron (Peace be upon them) rather he is on Melchizdek order, according to New Testament.  And there is no legitimacy to say that priest in ‪#‎Melchizdek‬ can become priest in the law of Torah. Therefore, it is in accordance with what Quran says about ‪#‎Jesus‬ ‪#‎Christ‬ (peace be upon him) is absolutely true words that will prevail over all other scriptures. Quran 4:157 That they said (in boast), ""We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah"";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:- ‪#‎Quran‬ 4:158 Rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise. ‪#‎John‬ 8:22 This made the Jews ask, ""Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?"" John 8:23 But he continued, ""You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.

2016-03-27T07:10:05,"Ash Kroft ... I'm with you.  But there are many in the world who will either outright deny that Jesus is God without even considering reading anything contrary to their assumptions; or just dip their foot in the shallow end, and just accept the authority of 'experts' that there is no God, the Bible is a fairy tale, etc.  While we can't go through the history of the centuries, we can pinpoint a few flashpoints that give an inkling why a vast number of human beings are so deceived.  In dawning of modern science, it was mostly scientific giants who were very largely Christians who paved the way, formulating the various disciplines we know today.  It was their worldview to 'think God's thoughts after Him' that there must be order in existence, otherwise it could not be studied.  We can see a macro example in time travel.  Let's assume it's possible.  If so, then the 'device' must also travel both through time and space, because everything is moving: the Earth around the Sun, in our galaxy and further everything else is moving.  Yet, if the Device works, and has the precise ability to pinpoint the exact place and moment that is targeted (let's say 100 years in the future), that would mean that the universe is operating on a pinpoint (and smaller) precision.  We certainly know now that we can target Mars, for instance, and know where it will be when our space probe reaches it.  Now true science observes what is there, and experiments confirm, etc.  Now, does this all happen by chance, or God, Infinite Intelligence and Power, etc.  One may say there is something inherent in Nature, but that is believing Nature itself is a god that is able to create things out of thin air, and all the other things in existence.  And so we come to the 'theory of evolution.'  The non-believer in God must have an explanation for existence, and 'macro evolution' is their trump card.  Again, to simplify things, study the occult origin of evolution.  Evolution was from ancient days, it's nothing new.  It was a counter argument that said nature is all powerful, or that the universe always was (as Carl Sagan put it).  People like Madame Blavansky and other occultists reveled in evolution, spiritual and otherwise.  The 'great' despots such as Hitler, Stalin, all did not believe in a God, but in an anti god, who had a mighty weapon of deception, evolution. Evolutionary 'theory' gave them the incentive to kill other humans at will, because all are animals, and it's survival of the fittest.  Nietzsche rightly predicted that the 20th century would be the bloodiest in history because men were disbelieving in God (he meant the idea of God, since he was an atheist), and he was right.  Go to John D. Rockefeller, who underwrote 'Christian' schools such as Union Theological Seminary, that imported 'higher criticism' from Germany, to teach that the Bible was in error.  Go to 1938 when an American communist disclosed that the Soviet's main target was to destroy God and Christianity in America (they were not the only ones, of course), because it was their main enemy.  He was murdered for his whistle-blowing.  Back to the occult origins of evolution, we can see Erasmus Darwin, grand dad to Charles, who was an 'avid' occultist.  Later, the British Royal Society was infiltrated by Erasmus' successors, who cleverly dislodged real science with quasi-science (instead of observation and experiments, it was now scenario writing), and Charles Darwin was there as front man.  Louis Pasteur destroyed the evolutionary theory of 'spontaneous generation' that life comes only from life, and not self develops from inert substances.  Yet this is a cornerstone of all scientism-evolution!  And it exists to this day, that life came from non-life!  part 2 follows",1,0,foreveragainOK,OcTVLfn5i8g,0.11559632034632035,2016-03-27 07:10:05,False,True

2016-03-28T03:53:36,"It was bought to my attention that John 10:30 says "" I and my father are one."" Yes it does! Yet what does that mean? So many of you, take that English translation, to mean that literally. Remember, God didn't write and hand down a English bible and say, here you go! The original languages were Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Therefore, just think people, if that's what that meant, then it would contradict other verses in the bible. Yet, The Three Musketeers are one. So,... does that mean that they are all together one man? Think people, that is so silly! One in that phrase, obviously means united, it's not hard people.  Also, just read on from John 10:30 and take notice of John 10: 36, there Jesus himself says he is the son of God. Furthermore, reason, when Jesus was about to be put to death, he prayed to God (not to himself). Lastly, note 1Corinthians 15:24-28. There it says that Jesus will hand over the Kingdom to God, and also note 28, in which Jesus will subject himself to God. Does not the Trinity teach that the three are all equal? Yet these verses say otherwise? Also note John 5:19 & 30 there Jesus says he can do nothing own his own, yet the Trinity says he's God. Really? It's not hard people.

Now look at the converse of  this hypothesis:  What if this man is who he said he was and did perform  miracles that were witnessed by multitudes of people?  Also, what if as  he promised, he busted out of his tomb after three days (with a Roman  military guard outside)?  That would definitely explain much......See  the movie and think about it.      Roman Soldiers guard the Tomb, Matthew 27:62-66    The Roman soldiers sealed the tomb. Then they stood guard for the next three days in four hour shifts of four soldiers each. How many Roman soldiers were there we do not know but it could have been as  many as 50 or more and also a number of soldiers from the temple guard  e.g. Jewish soldiers that worked at the Temple. The stone that closed the entrance was very large and was rolled in a  channel. This channel was sloped so it was easy to close but hard to  open. Background Reading: The Guards at the Tomb Secure it 27:62 The following day (that is, after the Day of Preparation), the high priests and Pharisees gathered before Pilate 63 and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said while he was still alive, ‘I will be raised after three days.’ 64 Therefore, order the tomb to be secured until the third day, or his  disciples may go and steal him and then tell the people, ‘He has been  raised from the dead.’ Then the last deception would be worse than the  first one.” 65 Pilate told them, “You have a military guard. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how.” 66 So they went and secured the tomb by putting a seal on the stone in the presence of the guards.  Matthew 27:62-66 More Information: These were regular Roman soldiers. A watch consisted of 4 soldiers  which was changed every four hours. They would die if their prisoner  escaped. These soldiers were not from the temple guard like the group  that came to imprison Jesus.",1,0,G Gibson,OcTVLfn5i8g,0.11483579638752052,2016-04-11 02:16:31,False,True

There no confusion either you believe in Jesus or not and of course Jesus is the only way the truth and the life. No one come to the father but Jesus Christ.

2016-06-27T23:02:51,"RISEN, does a great job at dispelling the myth that Saul/Paul of Tarsus was an apostle of Jesus Christ. After taking part in the death of Bar-abbas (Son of the Father) and the crucifixion/death of Jesus Bar-Jonah (Son of Holy Spirit/Dove), A Roman Tribune investigates the disappearance of the Jewish Messiah from the tomb of Joseph (earthly Father of Jesus, turned rich man of Arimathea, turned Apostle candidate to replace Judas - all 3 persons of the Father of Jesus are ""just"" men, the last even called ""Joseph Justus"").  Tribune eventually meets up with the RISEN Jesus face-to-face, and even witnesses Jesus perform a couple/few miracles. But after the Ascension of Yeshua (witnessed by Tribune), the Apostle Peter Bar-Jonah (Son of the Holy Spirit/Dove), the Rock/Cephas upon whom Jesus would build his church, asks Tribune to join the Disciples/Apostles as ""Fishers of Men"" i.e. ""Kippers/Purifiers of Men"".  But was Tribune going to be his ""Brother's Kipper""?  Apparantly not.   Tribune goes his separate way. We don't even have reason to believe that Tribune will keep his vow to the Jewish God Yahweh and initiate games in Yahweh's honor for handing over the Disciples to Tribune.  So how in the world are we supposed to believe that Saul/Paul of Tarsus, who never met Jesus in the flesh, did not witness the crucifixion, nor resurrection, nor ascension, nor the miracles of Jesus, how are we to believe that Saul/Paul (a type of Tribune) could become leader of the Christian religion and its doctrine and church, completely dominating the direction of the faith?   Kidnapping it in some respects from the True Apostles?   Keep in mind that Saul/Paul was a Benjamite Pharisee.  What was warned of these ravenous wolves in sheep's clothing and their yeast/false teaching with regards to Jesus' flock?
