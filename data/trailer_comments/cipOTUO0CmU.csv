I will be seeing this one for sure, and I will be more than happy to be proven wrong, but at this point I'm really skeptical.

They are also selling source codes of military satellites that were scheduled to be crashed to criminal groups, some of which are foreign nationals including groups that have tortured hundreds of ""veterans affairs junkies"" in this area into suicide using all of its equipment including ELF signals, RNM, and thermal scope that see's through roofs, relentlessly torturing them with these devices telling them to commit suicide ect. another group that is involved in human trafficking, and a ""patsy"" operation that uses a suit of strings and pulleys implanted and drilled into bones and soft tissues in peoples head, face, and bodies that is tightened or loosened with a magnetic device from these satellites, with the intention of making people look like other people in order to take the place of someone else, but has also been used to commit torture as well. In 2015 WOOT contractors used an older RNM device from one of these crashed satellites and fired it into the ground through this underground shelter with all the hatch's opened under the trailers. it lit up the trailer park with radiation that made the park more visible with thermal. then using a VACCIS scanner in the same manner until the shutter became stuck open and was dropped down a well leaking 7 RMS of cobalt 68 radiation.",0,0,Jack Einhoff,cipOTUO0CmU,-0.05277777777777777,2016-04-15 16:11:08,True,True

Neon as in pop culture, celebrities, colours, bright lights etc. and demon which is self explanatory. The trailer shows a delicate, humble girl, going through some sort of interview, to which many people want to succeed but only a few are capable. At the end she is told that she is capavle and is instantly shown in a darker light, and is led to darker places etc. I could be completely wrong but, that's just what I'm getting from thisüòÇ Thought I'd share..",0,1,J J,cipOTUO0CmU,0.06000000000000001,2016-04-16 01:36:58,True,True

He tries to go down to those unexplicable uncharted bizarre and grotesque corners of human mind. There is no one character in this movie whom you can relate to, it's a showdown of the weird.

At first I didn't quite understand it, but I did some digging around for an explanation and my God was this a masterpiece in showing the meaning. The way it was illustrated was truly magnificent and how every colour, being, mirror, etc was significant as well as linked to each other and the meanings. I love how it all progressively linked so subtly and how the graphic and shocking scenes did indeed get that ""reaction"" the director really wanted. It was a little slow and was really hard for me to decipher as I watched it, but once I researched behind it - it was a brilliant story, although perhaps a little slow or even tedious in places.

Is it the visual similarity to another female driven ""indie-looking"" film featuring the thematic importance of beauty and a good amount of body horror? I can see that, but the movies are really different beyond that. Neon Demon is surrealist satire mixed with horror elements. There's really nothing psychological about it. The main character proceeds through the film with the bravado of strong myth then arrives at a point where the entire through line of the film flips on its head, signaling a metatextual balancing of forces, suggesting something insightful and truly terrifying about our society.  Many people will highlight the issues on the surface, but I recommend looking closer and instead of writing it off, let the film challenge you.

Her dad just told her to ""stay sweet"", and they both abandon her.  -She dreams of a life of stardom, and is desperate to act grown up, and get all the attention. So she leaves home, and hitchhikes. Gets picked up by a cowboy, who charms her, but whom she also has lover's spats with. He soon thinks that they could be destined to be together. So he kidnaps, and rapes her. I think that the rape in particular, is relevant to Neon Demon, because Jesse wants to stay pure, at all costs. And doesn't even kiss a guy she actually likes. Not really indicative of having been assaulted, but Refn said that the scene in which Keanu's character sticks a knife in Jesse's mouth, was representative of how she imagines penetration to be. And of course, that's extreme, for someone who's only had normal, if any, sexual experience.   -There's also the end of Hick, where Alec Baldwin's character sends her to LA, to live with his sister, and go to a fancy school. I could imagine that during that time, she didn't really connect with his sister, or do well in school (probably because of bullying rooted in jealousy) dropped out, and ran away again, to pursue stardom.

2020-05-24T23:13:59,"I just saw this movie yesterday on a whim and was blown away. It's crazy how many negative reviews this got. I started it with no expectations and finished it realizing I had just watched a MASTERPIECE. Jaw-dropping visuals and soundtrack that makes every other movie look dull in comparison, the lack of dialogue is done purposefully as the visuals and the actor's expressions and body language do most of the talking. Multiple layers of meaning and symbolism throughout. This movie is a work of art, and anyone who thinks it's bad simply doesn't understand what they are watching.",0,0,Gunnar S,cipOTUO0CmU,-0.11296296296296296,2020-05-24 23:13:59,False,False
2020-05-24T23:58:07,"I feel like there's an important point people miss about this movie. While it seems like Jesse (Elle Fanning)¬†is the star of the movie and everything revolves around her, at the end we see this movie is actually about Sarah. Jesse is just the competition in her way that she needs to get rid of, and in the end she emerges victorious. The ruthless villain¬†willing to do anything ends up winning, as often is the case in real life. Another thing is, people say this movie is simply about the modeling industry and ""instagram culture"" when I see it more as applying to any cut-throat world such as the business or corporate world where others are seen as competitors and obstacles in the way to success. The cannibalism is just an allegory of this IMO, as she literally ""ate"" her competition. Brilliant movie.",0,1,Gunnar S,cipOTUO0CmU,0.15384615384615385,2020-05-24 23:58:07,False,False
