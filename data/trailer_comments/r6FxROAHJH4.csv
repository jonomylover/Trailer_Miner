They need to start from scratch but not completely follow the movie timeline. I would love to see them start from the beginning and show the three covens and how they formed the treaty ( one rules while two sleep).Show the Lycan rebellion and how they lived in the shadows and grew in strength. Show the battles between both sides throughout the ages. Then bring it into modern times, introduce the humans as a power. Show them as players in the treaty, they are aware of Vampires and Lycans. They have a treaty with both sides that they keep their war out of the public eye. You could show the failures and the struggles between the three sides to do just that. You could have the conspiracy theorist screaming from the rooftops that immortals walk amongst us. Bring in a human who was injected with the blood of Alexander Corvinus(The guy on the boat who was immortal (but neither Lycan or Vampire). Show him as a source of power without him knowing it and the attempts of the Vampires and Lycans to bring him to their side. There is also a change of director, Weisman is out and a female director is in.I could go further but Iam probably boring a lot of people.¬† The down side to this is that they showed a major spoiler which gave away the ending.

If Speedman wanted out fine, but recasting him when Speedman's portrail of him was so vital to Selene's story is a tough one to take. What is up with their daughter Eve not being in this? that's what's really confusing to me. I thought India Eisley was a powerful addition to the cast. Her performance of Eve was fascinating and touching in the sense of how it and added a whole new level of depth to Selene's character as a mother who now must protect her child at all costs. Looking back on how 'Awakening' ended it was heavily implied they were as mother and daughter in this fight to the end. Looks to me like that's not the case now which is a serious shame, that storyline had so much potential. Why introduce her at all if you're not going to utilise her character in future films? Eve being the first and only Tri - Blood Hybrid of her kind and the last living descendant Alexander Corvinus should be one of the key factors in this film (in my opinion anyway).

I have been keeping up with all the news about the movie so I know Scott declined the role of Micheal (once again) but this is a whole new story and it leaves me with so many questions and I really think that's a shame for the story was so good in my opinion until now....I am going to watch it tho because perhaps my opinion will change but for now I am really disappointed with the turn this story took and how Scott isnt in the movie and even if they recast I think that would be even worse for I dislike recasting in a movie seeing how the story started with the actor and should end with the same actor in that role but I cant wait for the tv series and I hope it will air soon!

Underworld and underworld evolution were the best in my opinon. 3 was just sad and 4 was promising with selene's daughter, but obviously she either got killed off somehow which makes no sense considering the fact that if you go by her bloodline and who her parents are she could wipe the floor with a lycan or vampire, or the actress did not want to or the director did not want her back. Oh well, I'll see the movie but only because kate beckinsale is reprising her role and im curious to see how her character and storyline change.

The werewolves just look like generic villains that, for some reason, seem to have no likeable or relatable characters to root for or attach to and seem to have no female members..which makes ZERO sense.  They might as well call this ""Underworld: Awakening 2."" It's like the producers forgot the history of the franchise and forgot making Rise of the Lycans.  It was the vampires that had enslaved werewolves to work for them and protect them.  It was a vampire leader that took the first new type of werewolf (Lycan) away from his mother, while he was still a baby..right after shooting the mother, to raise and use him to make more Lycans.  It is that same vampire leader that started the war by murdering his own pregnant daughter..who had a love connection with the Lycan leader.  And then to make it worse..that vampire leader killed Selene's family and blamed it on Lycans..causing her to hate Lycans and spend years fighting them.  Werewolves defeated the vampires and won their freedom but were hunted down for centuries as the war waged on.  Now they want to make werewolves Nazi-like creatures that seem to only want destruction and make the blood-sucking slave drivers the victims/heroes??  Give us a break!

2016-12-16T23:49:25,"FACTS; the underworld series was originally only supposed to be the 3 movies. The movie is revolved around the daughter actually, but she stays hidden due to the fact that everyone wants her blood, literally. Selene hides her daughter and embarks on a mission to end everything with a man name David and Davids father. I have no idea what happened to Michael or where he is, but he will no longer be played by Speedman. However, there will be a sixth movie. The underworld movies are like notorious for sending you into the future then bringing you to the past and the linking it all together. (Hence the 3rd movie literally telling how everything began, and the 1 & 2 portraying the after events) so Maybe well find out more about Michael in that movie and they'll link a lot of connections for us. Further more the film series is being made into a Television show, in case you didn't know.",0,0,Extraneouss _,r6FxROAHJH4,0.05984848484848486,2016-12-16 23:49:25,True,True
