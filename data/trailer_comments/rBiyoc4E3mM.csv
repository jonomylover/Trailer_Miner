It creates an already growing stigma that people can only have PTSD if they're a war veteran when that is NOT the cause. Victims of abuse, harrasment, and people who've survived dangerous situations are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the number of scenarios that could lead to someone being diagnosed with PTSD. I'm tried of telling people what I have and them saying that what happened to me is somehow flase because 'im too young', or 'im not a war veteran so I can't have ptsd'.

It's like the dude actually died and was reborn in the same body, but had to start all over again.  It's infuriating what those people did.   Those fucking pussies couldn't handle a man in high heels. That's very questionable about them and their hidden sexualities. Usually the most homophobic and hateful people are the ones hiding similar interests and desires. Mad that someone else has the courage to freely be themselves and they can't. They think being hateful towards it will make it their hiddens desires go away because they were taught to be against it all. It's fucking stupid, and you're a fucking pansy if you get offended or angry over a man who likes heels and stockings. Mark Hogancamp is a REAL man.

2019-01-01T09:34:05,"Welcome to Marwen... The movie was just plain weird. Steve Carrell is great but the directing was garbage. There is a scene that really ticked me off. Mark is in court about to testify about the crimes that have been done to him. It had potential to be a heart wrenching, sad, and emotional scene. Instead, Marks doll character ‚ÄúHogey‚Äù starts fighting nazis and Mark crawls on the ground avoiding the crossfire (bullets). The movie was more about Marks dolls then actually Mark. I feel like i saw more of ‚ÄúHogey‚Äù then Mark himself. Not about overcoming his fears. The movie felt boring, i had no care on what the Marwen characters had to say because THEY ARE NOT REAL. They said based on a true story, they forgot to tell me 2/3‚Äôs of the movie is dolls fighting.  The movie also left plenty of questions unanswered. When Mark is in Wendy‚Äôs house, he notices a photo of a young child. It says something like ‚ÄúWe miss you‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou will forever be in our hearts‚Äù. But We never know what happend to the child and why it is included in the movie. The movie also didn‚Äôt tell us more about the side characters. The women of Marwen are Marks friends. But we never really go deep into who the characters actually are. Next, The movie ends with Mark and his good friend (Roberta) going out to eat some sushi, thats it. Nothing else, do they continue dating, do they end up marrying at one point? Lastly, this is my biggest frustration: In the end of the movie the film does not tell you what happens to the thugs that beat Mark up. Do they get a long sentencing? Do they get life in prison??? You wont know because they wont tell you. This movie is very confusing, making you wonder if it is Marks fantasy or real life. There was no music that moved you, no emotional scenes. Unlike the trailer, the trailer felt moving and had a wonderful soundtrack. Im just truly dissatisfied with this movie.",1,4,Parker Brown,rBiyoc4E3mM,0.0998469387755102,2019-01-01 09:34:05,False,True
