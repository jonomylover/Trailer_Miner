This guys ruined my country and their heritage still keeps Russia down. The more people will spit on their graves the better. And I like this cast. Can't wait to see movie in theater. Also I don't get ""they had to hire russian actors rant"". This is american movie. Sure there're a lot of russians in US but how the hell they should find russian cast that will suit characters? There're many movies in Russia about WW2, where germans speak russian and that's ok.

I don't understand that comedy is the best way of mocking authoritarian regimes. I personally don't understand black humour at all and don't know about the events surrounding Stalin's death and why it is such a good setting for a political comedy.  I don't like this film because I am a Communist and I don't like having the realities of Inner Party Communist politics after a power vacuum being exposed in a humorous way that makes my ideology look fucking retarded.  I don't like this film because I am a Russian Nationalist that wants to defend a Georgian street thug that starved and enslaved my people and nearly lost the war but I have to defend this monster or face the idea of Westerners mocking my nations history. I am simply here to autistically screech about this film mocking my country's past which contains events that are easily exploitable for a dark political comedy. I must defend my country's honour like the little Putin sycophant I am.  I don't like this film because the actors use their native accents instead of constantly using dodgy Russian ones. I am unbelievably petty to not see past this aspect of the film.  I don't like this film because the actors are not Russian. I do not understand that this film is for a *English speaking audience* and so having Russian actors does not add to the film. I cannot see that this film has great comedic actors like Jeffrey Tambor, Steve Buscemi, Micheal Palin and Jason Isaacs that are seasoned actors that will likely do great performances in this film.

But, as well as that, it's a  western film about their opinion on what was going on. Russian people who care will simply have a different, personal one.  The main thing is: they will not find it funny. Remember ""Party like a Russian""? That simple song that pointed out a lot of faults with the way Russia seems to work today was not funny to them, and it was taken as a light offense(the media did somewhat help with that). Why? Because Russians prefer to talk about serious shit seriously, or not to talk at all. Especially while the talking is about the time when you could be dragged off for thinking about something that wasn't allowed.  Basically, main thought - People of Russia will be angry with the West telling Russian history with satire (pieces of this can already be seen in the comments).",0,0,maks leon,kPpXFnHoC-0,0.021333333333333336,2017-08-21 20:04:19,True,True

Now let me say, if you believe that making a movie to make fun of the death of a person, just because he was ""Evil"" , you are the worst kind of self-centered child there is. Yes, he sent millions to their deaths, he was a terrible father, he was a terrible husband, he was all on all just a terrible person, more similar to Hitler than one would think. He also modernized Russia, pushing it to super power status, he defeated almost single handily Germany, effectively wiping out Fascism.  Historical figures are also people, and just because you disagree with them doesn't make them EVIL. In fact it just proves that you are a child who still believes in the ""We are good and they are bad"" tale of morality. People are complex, and come with a mixed baggage, and simply condemning Stalin and painting him as a monster is dehumanizing...which is what he did. Do you really think like Stalin? He needed to be inhumane to be effective in his rule, what are your reasons for treating a person like a caricature? If you have none then you are worst than the ""monster"" you condemn.   In overall,there is no ""joke"" when it comes to the death of a person. NO matter who the cunt was, let him die. It isn't funny; would it be Stalin, would it be Hitler or would it be Pol Pot (that one I hate particularly).

2017-08-24T00:47:14,"Long one here:  I know many may not agree with me, but i honestly don't think the point of this movie is ""Fuck Russia, they're just a bunch of clowns"". Armando Iannucci is a well travelled, intelligent person, he's taken a fuck-ton of bites out of the governments of both Great Britain (The Thick of it, In the Loop - any Russians, anyone really, please check 'em out if you have the option) and the USA (Veep). Considering his past career i honestly believe that the point of this movie will be: ""Look. The Politics of Russia have often been just as venal, petty and farcical as the politics in the west. They are not the ""Evil Empire"" - they're just as clumsy as us"". If anything i think that this one might be a bit more generous being as it isn't set in the present day.   The choice for them to be played by actors from western backgrounds who are not attempting (what would probably be very poor) Russian accents i think is probably meant to humanise the characters - if someone has a similar accent to you, you're not thinking all the time: ""wow, a stupid Russian-y Russian"", you're thinking: ""wow, that Zuhkov sure is a prankster... etc. etc."" and this film seems largely aimed at western audiences. The idea being that you perceive the characters to be speaking as eloquently (or in-eloquently) in YOUR language as they would in, real life, be speaking in their own with all the regional dynamics and colloquialism roughly substituted.    As for the comparison to black-face... come on. Black-Face is regarded as offensive largely due to the history surrounding it and the very obvious racial divide involved - not tryin' to suggest black folks are 'lower' than white people but if you've ever heard the expression 'punching down' - that's the problem with it. I wouldn't say that the relationship between Russia and the west constitutes a similar imbalance of power and thus i think the black-face comparison is a pretty false equivalence.  Ulitimatley the point of this film seems to be the satire of political structures and corruption. It being set amidst a Soviet background is really just flavour. You can ask why it wasn't left to be made by a set of Russian creators (and that's not an invalid point i'll concede) but i think considering the political climate in Russia at the moment with regards to the federal government's attitude towards freedom of the press it seems like that would be unlikely to happen.

2017-08-26T14:38:16,"Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (18 December 1878 ‚Äì 5 March 1953) was a Georgian-born Soviet revolutionary and political leader.  He governed the Soviet Union as its dictator from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953, serving as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1952 and as Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1953.   Ideologically a Marxist and a Leninist, he helped to formalise these ideas as Marxism‚ÄìLeninism while his own policies became known as Stalinism.  Born to a poor family in Gori, Russian Empire, as a youth Stalin joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.  He edited the party newspaper Pravda and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets.  Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles.  After the Bolsheviks gained power in the October Revolution of 1917 and established the Soviet Russian Republic, Stalin sat on the governing Politburo during the Russian Civil War and helped form the Soviet Union in 1922.  Despite Lenin's objections, Stalin consolidated power and a cult of personality developed around him.  During Stalin's tenure, the concept of ""Socialism in One Country"" became a central tenet of Soviet society, and Lenin's New Economic Policy was replaced with a centralised command economy, industrialisation and collectivisation.  These rapidly transformed the country from an agrarian society into an industrial power, but disrupted food production and contributed to the famine of 1933‚Äì34.  Between 1934 and 1939, Stalin organised the ""Great Purge"", in which millions of so-called ""enemies of the working class"", including senior political and military figures, were interned in Gulag-run prisons, exiled or executed.  Stalin's government promoted Marxism‚ÄìLeninism through the Communist International and supported anti-fascist movements throughout Europe in the 1930s, including during the Spanish Civil War.  However, in 1939 they signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in their joint invasion of Poland.  Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941.  Despite initial setbacks, the Soviet Red Army halted the German incursion and captured Berlin in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  The Soviet Union annexed the Baltic states and supported the establishment of pro-Soviet Marxist governments throughout Eastern Europe and in China, North Korea and North Vietnam.  The Soviet Union and United States emerged as the two world superpowers, and a period of tensions began between the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc and U.S.-backed Western Bloc known as the Cold War.  Stalin led his country through its post-war reconstruction, during which it developed a nuclear weapon and initiated major construction and land development projects in response to another major famine.  Stalin died in 1953 and was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who denounced his predecessor and initiated a de-Stalinisation process throughout Soviet society.  Stalin is widely considered one of the most significant figures of the 20th century.   Stalinism influenced Marxist‚ÄìLeninist groups and governments across the world, for whom Stalin was a champion of socialism and the working class.  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as an effective wartime leader who established the Soviet Union as a major world power.   Conversely, his autocratic government has been widely denounced for overseeing mass repressions, hundreds of thousands of executions and millions of deaths through famines and labour camps.",1,0,Stella Maris,kPpXFnHoC-0,0.06617213804713805,2017-08-26 14:38:16,True,True

2017-09-09T19:24:45,"For the neo-soviets in the comments here's some facts about how Stalin was a monster.  STALIN‚ÄôS ATROCITIES  Forced collectivisation moved millions of people from the countryside to the cities, allowing the Soviet Union to industrialisation. The upheaval caused by this massive forced movement of people contributed to the Soviet famine of 1932-33 (known as the Holodomor in Ukraine) in which at least five million died.  Increasingly paranoid, Stalin unleashed his ‚ÄúGreat Terror‚Äù in the 1930s. 750,000 members of the military or the Communist Party who he thought might oppose him were executed. Three million were exiled ‚Äì imprisoned in gulags where they became slave labour.  And, in the Second World War, millions of civilians (both Soviet and German) were killed during the brutal conflict on the Eastern Front.  ESTIMATES OF HOW MANY PEOPLE STALIN KILLED  Dictators are, as you might imagine, not keen to record how many people they are killing.So it is tricky to establish exactly how many people died as a result of Stalin‚Äôs policies.  Estimates of the death toll vary widely, from 3.5-8 million (G Ponton) at the low end to 60 million (A Solzhenitsyn).  Today, most historians seem to have settled on a total of about 20 million.  According to John Heidenrich, in his book¬†‚ÄúHow to Prevent Genocide: A Guide for Policymakers, Scholars, and the Concerned Citizen‚Äù¬†the death toll can be divided into three broad groups:  Kulaks and forced collectivisation: 7 millionGulags: 12 millionPurges: 1.2 million  Robert Conquest, in his book¬†The Great Terror: A Reassessment, divides the figure another way:  ¬†1930-36: 7 million1937-38: 3 million1939-53: 10 million  The number of deaths in the Soviet Union that were explicitly ordered by someone ‚Äì in other words, the number of executions ‚Äì is actually relatively low at around 1.5 million.  The majority of the deaths were caused by neglect or repressive policies ‚Äì for example, those who died in the Soviet gulags, those who died while being deported, and the German civilians and Prisoners of War are believed to have perished while under Soviet guard.  Some historians argue that victims of famines should be counted as victims of Stalin. However because they were, if not the direct result of Stalin‚Äôs policies, at the very least exacerbated by Stalin‚Äôs policies, there is a very strong counter-argument to say that they should be included. Most historians do include the victims of famine in any counts.  WHICH 20TH CENTURY DICTATOR KILLED THE MOST PEOPLE?  Despite the horrific death toll listed above, Stalin doesn‚Äôt hold the distinction of being the most genocidal leader of the 20th century.

The level of medicine had seen a significant progress and became one of the best in the globe. Education, science, technology experienced great backup and were thriving.   From the other hand he was the initiator of the great terror throughout the country.

But in his heart, he already knew.  Scarcely two seconds had passed since the last knock when the door flew off its hinges. When the dust cloud settled, the sight both shocked and pleased Mario. That handsome face. Those rippling abs. That well-kept moustache. God, it had been so long.  ""Joseph! My love, you're back!"" shouted Mario. Without a word, Stalin removed his clothes to reveal his massive throbbing cock. Silently, both Mario and Luigi knelt down and began to lick the shaft, gliding their hands over the head. Pre-cum dripped from the dictator's erect member.  ""Yes, this is good,"" boomed Stalin. ""You will be put on politburo, Luigi. And Mario: you will be Chief of the Red Army. Of course, you must understand what this means you must do...""  Mario nodded. Removing his overalls, Mario turned around and presented his tight Italian plumber ass to the leader of the Soviet Union. Luigi blushed as he realised what was about to transpire. ""I'm ready, daddy,"" whimpered Mario. ""You don't have to use lube.""  Stalin shoved his entire arm into Mario's boyish anus. A little blood trickled out as Mario shrieked in pleasure. Luigi began to stroke his long Italian salami as he watched the fisting.  After minutes of Stalin's arm thrusting in and out of his kawaii ass, Mario came all over the carpet. ""Mamma mia! That was the best orgasm I've ever had! Dios mio!""  Stalin removed his arm, which was now covered in blood, shit, and cum. ""I am glad you enjoyed it. You will not go to gulag today. But I've still got something to take care of,"" he moaned, staring Luigi directly in the eye. Wordlessly, Luigi bent over the table and waited for the USSR to nuke his butt.  As Stalin thrusted into his rectum, Luigi noticed that a crowd had formed around him. Toad, Peach, Daisy, and the ghost of Vladimir Lenin were all staring on as he was anally pounded by the Premier. Toad shed his clothes and started to masturbate to this wonderful sight. Peach and Daisy began to make out as Lenin penetrated Mario from behind.

2017-11-21T13:52:07,"I want to take this opportunity to debunk some of the assumptions people are erroneously making about this film: - This movie is about what happened just AFTER the death of Stalin. It doesn't go out of its way to victimize or  the man, and it is certainly not focused on him. It is chiefly about the mad scramble for power by his inner circle for the vacuum his death leaves behind. - This wasn't made, directed, or even produced anywhere near Hollywood. This is a joint British-French-Canadian independent film that just happens to have the cast and production quality of a potential Hollywood feature. - As emphasized by many of the more level-headed in the comments, this film is a work of comedy and satire by the formidable Armando Iannucci, who made his name crucifying (with great hilarity) Western governments. Why he should be stopped from giving the Russians (and eventually the Germans, but hell, they get enough wacky Nazi films already) the same treatment is bordering on hypocrisy. - Finally, as also an incidental work of history the film takes some significant pains to introduce some figures in the then-Presidium that have, to my knowledge, never been introduced in Western media. Who can say from a diet of Western TV, films, and other popular media that they have heard the names of Mikoyan, Bulganin, Kaganovich, or even Malenkov?

2018-03-11T09:12:09,"With support from inside the Social Democratic party and many of the Jewish-run soviets, Lenin, joined by Trotsky from New York, gained the upper hand over the Kerensky government. In August of 1917, the Russian Royal Family fled to Tobolsk in Siberia. They stayed at the Governors House until April 1918. They hoped to escape to England where King George V, a Romanov cousin, would hopefully grant them refuge. But he refused due to pressure from Jewish groups. On April 22 1918, the Jew, Jacob Sverdlov, first President of the Soviet Union, sent his aide, the Jew, Yankel Yakovlev, to Tobolsk to persuade Tzar Nicholas II to agree to sanction the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty. Tzar Nicholas refused for he considered the treaty an ‚Äòeternal disgrace to Russia.‚Äô He did though agree to return to Moscow as he was told that the Germans were willing to grant him asylum. They got as far as Ekaterinburg in the Urals where the train was halted by the Regional Soviets dominated by four Jews, Goloshchekin, Safarov, Voikov and Syromolotov. These four communist Jews appointed the Jew, Jacob Yurovsky, son of a local Jewish ex-convict, as the head the local Cheka (Soviet Secret Police) in Ekaterinburg. Yurovsky was given the assignment to imprison, plan, and carry out, the assassination of the Russian Royal Family. The Jew Yurovsky brought the Russian Royal Family to a former house of a wealthy Jewish merchant named Ipatiev, now made into a prison for the Tzar and his family. It should be noted that Ekaterinburg, named after named after St Catherine the Great, was renamed ‚ÄúSverdlovsk‚Äù in 1924 in honor of Jacob Sverdlov who gave the final order to execute the Russian Royal Family. On July 4 1918, the Jew Yurovsky dismissed all the Russian soldiers who were guarding the Tzar except for a Pavel Medvedev, a Cheka Jewish spy. Yurovsky replaced the loyal-to-the-Tzar Russian soldiers with Jewish communist assassins from Hungary. That they were Jewish communists from Hungary, their scribbling on the walls indicated. On July 15 1918, two representatives from the Soviet Extraordinary Commission, one of them being the Jew, Philip Golochtchekine, came to the Ipatiev house with an order from the Jew Jacob Yurovsky to execute the Russian Royal Family. On July 17 1918, about midnight, the Jew Yurovsky brought Tzar & Tzarina Nicholas and Alexandra, and their four daughters, the maid, the doctor, the cook, and the waiter to the basement. The Tzar carried the heir Alexei in his arms. They were told that they were to pose for a group picture. The Jewish assassins, Medvedev, Nikulin, Yermakov, Vaganov, were waiting. Medvedev claimed that he was outside at the time of the execution as his guilty conscience shamed his tongue into lying. The Jew Yurovsky then pulled out his revolver and pointed it directly at the Tsar‚Äôs head and fired. Tzar Nicholas II died instantly. Next, he shot Tzarina Alexandra as she made the sign of the Cross. Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia, were shot next. Demidova, the maid, survived the first volley, so the Jewish Cheka assassins decided to bayonet her 30 times. As the room became silent there was a low groan. Alexei was still in the arms of the Tsar and alive. The Jew Yurovsky stepped up and fired two shots into the boy‚Äôs ear. All the members of the Tsar‚Äôs family were lying on the floor with many wounds in their bodies. The blood was running in streams.",0,2,Albert Stier,kPpXFnHoC-0,0.06733405483405484,2018-03-11 09:12:09,False,True

2019-06-16T15:52:58,"Gulag - 60,000,000 victims   It was the most terrifying system of exploitation and extermination, probably comparable only to the madness of the Holocaust.  At the peak of the camps there were even several million prisoners - about five percent of the entire population of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.   When trying to estimate the number of Gulag victims, one should also remember those who died during the transport to the labor camps and those who died after leaving the camp as a result of complete exhaustion of the organism.   Alexander Alexander Solzhenitsyn believed that from the beginning of the revolution to 1956, more than 60 million citizens of the USSR were killed in the camps.  The lion's share fell on the rule of Stalin (the Gulag system started for good in 1923, and after the death of D≈ºugashvili it was quickly extinguished).   Ôøº   Construction of the Bia≈Çomorskie Canal.  According to Solzhenitsyn, up to a quarter of a million victims of Stalin's terror died (and died: source: the public domain).   This shocking number is questioned by most historians.  Let us add, however, that the Gulag prisoners were not only citizens of the USSR, but also, among others, millions of German prisoners of war or hundreds of thousands of Poles.   World War II - 27,000,000 victims   I count on Stalin's account all the victims of the Second World War on the side of the USSR (both military and civilian), because the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact led to its outburst.   For almost two consecutive years, Stalin was a faithful ally of Hitler, allowing him further conquests, while taking in himself the eastern Poland, part of Finland, the Baltic states and Romanian Bessarabia.  Extremely high Soviet losses during the war (many times higher than German ones) caused, above all, the contempt of Soviet decision-makers for human life",0,0,wiwo84 wsd,kPpXFnHoC-0,0.05180555555555555,2019-06-16 15:52:58,False,False
