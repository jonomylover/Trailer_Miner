2015-01-16T17:53:51,Why are you guys are comparing this to hitch? 1. How about you first see the movie and then put your two cents in. 2. Hitch was about helping nerds get the girl of their dreams and a 'happily ever after'. 3. The Wedding Ringer is about helping guys look cool at their weddings. How does this movie have anything to do with Hitch?  The character Doug is already getting married. He just needs to pretend he has friends. The only thing that I can say is simpler to Hitch is that we all know at the end that Kevin is gonna end up being friends with the Doug character. Just like Will was with Albret Brennaman. ,22,0,RatedRx3,R3TeI9jPPuA,0.32999999999999996,2015-01-16 17:53:51,False,True
