It's true that the movie may grab your undivided attention (not all the movie), however for most of the movie it seemed all pretty predictable. Prior to the movie I had not read the book or anything related to it, this movie was suggested to me by several people about its grabbing, thrilling, twisted story line. I believe this to be a 6/10, it may have grabbed my attention initially but throughout the movie I simply faded out as what was coming next was predictable. The ending could have been different, it could have pushed character development in some areas and the overall plot of the movie is boring but thrilling, a sort of juxtaposition. If you're a twisted, thrilling movie fan then this is the movie for you, but if you want a realistic movie that actually makes real sense then stay away!, The ""hype"" around this movie was a bit too much and I am sad to say that it fell short from what was expected. ",0,0,sdotr1990,esGn-xKFZdU,-0.00431547619047619,2014-12-15 21:58:24,False,True
