2014-10-23T22:16:39,"I really loved the first one, which is why I need to address something: 1: Why make a second one? The first one ended on a pretty good note, theres no need to make a new one. 2: This seems like every other haunted house film EVER. Seriously, a group of people stay the night at a haunted house because they don't have anywhere else to go. And haunted stuff happens. Sound familiar? and 3: They don't even have the same idea of horror that the first one had. The first one was scary because of 2 reasons: Its environment, and the lack of characters. It was scary because it was subtle, not full of jump scares. Granted it did have some, but there were at least 3 jump scares in this trailer alone. And in the first one, the lack of characters created an isolated environment, which made it even scarier. Im sure this one will be scary (maybe) but it can't possible live up to the original, which in my book, is what a sequel is suppose to do.   Such a waste.

2014-12-11T06:25:58,"I Love SCARY Movies. I watch all of them but most of them are more  entertaining then scary like Freddy ,Chucky, Michael, Scream. The ones that are scary to me are  paranormal stuff. I also love Zombie movies and the show Walking Dead . What I do not like are the ones that involves the deaths of Children and Baby's especially The Walking Dead they have a baby  that's about the same age as mine baby girl and it literally makes me panic when Judith the baby on the show is in danger in any way oh and when that little girl thought that Zombies were still people so to prove it she stabbed her little sister then the short haired woman that I can never remember her name....Carol yeah Carol had to shoot her because she was a danger to others and obviously sick in the head. It really bothered me. So to those in the comments that is actually still reading this I have a question for you. Do you think the writers of the show went too far when they pu that in the show and does it bother you when you see children in danger or get killed in movies and or shows? I mean I get it it's for shock value and maybe there's a message in there somewhere that has some sort of meaning behind. I mean I still watch scary Movie's/T.V. shows with children in it but it always bothers me to the point that I will fast forward over the part. There also was a scene in The Walking Dead where Judith was held hostage and the guy was holding the baby in a position that was threatning and was going to kill her if that one guy didn't leave the cabin.

Everybody has the right to comment whatever the hell they want toó but just because you dont like that person's comment it does not give you the right to be rude or disrespectful towards that person.

If you are not christian and you dont like that comment about jesus and satán or whatever, fucking ignore it!!  You dont have to reply to it, its ok by just ignoring it, you dont have to be an asshole and come and post a disrespectful comment just to offend this person in particular.   What if you were talking about something that to you is very important and someone just comes and say something like ""your beliefs and statement are stupid!"" you would feel bad about it, even if you say you would just ignore it, that feeling of someone being rude to you just because of your beliefs is just wrong.  Of course there are some christians whos comments may offend others but those who actually offend others using christianity as a shield are not real christians, those are assholes who are not brave enough to offend you with their bare words. Christianity is not about offending anyone is about sharing love with everyone.  Stop bullying christians for what they believe, specially if they are not offending you in anyway.   And if you see a christian comment and you dont like it, just ignore it... You gain nothing by offending someone for what is true to them.

There's a difference between being startled and being scared. Anybody jumps at loud noises, it's human nature, it can be a drum hit, a musical note, or someone talking loud. We jump not because it scared us, but because it's loud and startles us! The last GOOD scary movie I can think of if the top of my head that had little to no jump scares was The Strangers. Remember when they would just show up in the background and you would get chills? They didn't pop out of nowhere and yell BOOGIDY BOOGIDY BOO!  They made your hair stand up because it was genuinely scary. Shame on the movie industry for pumping out these crappy jump scare fests with rehashed stories!
