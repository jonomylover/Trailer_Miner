If Nick Fury has had her in his back pocket since the 80s, why didn't he just recruit her as an Avenger from day one? It doesn't make sense. Why wait until after Thanos acquired all the affinity stones and started decimating half the population of the universe before bothering to call on her with his superhero pager?

2018-09-18T17:26:17,"Okay so if I say ""I liked it when she punched the old lady"" will people think I am a bad person? Lol.  Okay so honest appraisal. First of all the old lady was blatantly a Skrull, but I like what they did there. I get absolutely no sense of personality from Brie Larson in this trailer. Hopefully that is the character and her situation in these brief scenes and not just the actress not doing a great job (I'm not really familiar with her). The rest of what we saw looked pretty reasonable. For a teaser I'd give it a B. As for affecting where I currently was in anticipating this movie I would say my expectations have gone up slightly. I should add though I wasn't expecting great things but thought it could be passable, now I think there is a good chance it'll be okay and some chance of being good.   I should add, I'm only familiar with the character from back when she was Ms Marvel, so I don't know how OP she is in the comics now but I'm hoping they don't upgrade her too much. Mostly the MCU has downgraded power levels not upgraded them. I also kind of want Rogue to steal her powers later on and that won't make sense if she is already too OP (Sorry Captain Marvel fans, but I love Rogue way more and want her origins to be done right this time).",0,0,Fil Arkonus,moY78qMJuxM,0.2502046130952381,2018-09-18 17:26:17,True,True

There are plenty of women superhero characters with good story arcs that have much more to offer rather than trying to use a role to simply replace men.  It is pathetic that these people get MILLIONS of dollars to make a 90 minute video and the most creative thing they do is change the gender role. Hmm seems like propaganda to me.

2018-09-20T20:58:22,"I‚Äôm hesitant about what this trailer shows. In the comics, Carol got her powers from Mar-vell in an incident involving alter tech and fashioned her own hero identity after what he stood for, becoming Ms Marvel. Here it seems like she was ‚Äòalways‚Äô Captain Marvel, and exclude her comic origins, and how she took the name Captain Marvel in honer of Mar-vell after his death. With how the comics have been damaged by SJW politics, it worries me that this will become ‚Äúshe‚Äôs great because she‚Äôs a women‚Äù instead of ‚Äúshe‚Äôs great because she‚Äôs a hero‚Äù. Too many good characters have been ruined by focusing on identity politics over character development and not remaining faithful to the source material.

2018-09-22T04:53:26,I don't get why people are hating because of Larson expression not changing. Those were only a few scenes we saw not the whole movie. Chances are the character she is portraying doesn't smile much and is probably the serious type like batman. Though this is Marvel so they'll probably have scenes with Nick Fury and Colison that will help make it funny.  I mainly going with the fact Marvel has succed in each of their films so chances are this one will be good they haven't let us down yet.,0,0,LigerZero,moY78qMJuxM,0.11277777777777775,2018-09-22 04:53:26,True,True

2018-09-26T15:11:40,"Wonder Woman: a super slut that naively believes in man and his world. She's too weak to stop bullets but add magical bracelets to her wrist and a shield and she can deflect mortar shells and bullets effortlessly without so much as the concussive force damaging her. However, grenades can knock her around.......but the shrapnel does no damage. She is fast enough to follow bullets coming in through the air with her head and eyes without snapping her neck off but (again) can't stop them without the bracelets. She is stronger than steel until Ares (Magneto) wraps her in metal ........until she decides she's super strong and can get out of that metal burrito. She never gets fatigue or bruises even when pushed to her physical limits and every dramatic shot is basically saying, ""look at this poor, beautiful woman that doesn't sweat or get wrinkles on her forehead from stress, this perfect young woman that is overwhelmed by tragedies around her and surrounded by Nazi Males; if only men would just believe in her and follow her."" A real hero to women is pile of fiction created by men that most women can never live up to (especially since men age better than women). Even the actress playing Wonder Woman is unable to have that body naturally, she has no tits! But Wonder Woman is the official representative/mascot for women at the UN. When women wonder why they aren't taken seriously in the world, that's why.......Wonder Woman. How can men take seriously a people that never take themselves seriously?  Captain Marvel, I thought, was going to be another shitty feminist movie and it probably will. However, the trailer actually looks really interesting. She isn't playing up her body (shocker). From what I got from only looking at the trailer and having read one answer from an interview Brie did; this movie is the story of an airforce pilot abducted by aliens and inducted into an interstellar special forces unit and mind-wiped. She's trained to fight another intergalactic superpower that is on a campaign of conquest. Her mentor is also her alien special forces boss and is the central piece of her life with the Kree. She crashes back to earth with no memories and has to quickly acclimate to earth, recall her abilities and vulnerabilities, and remember her mission and self (her choices; who she fights for and believes in and why). She and Shield have to very quickly pick sides with limited information in a war that will determine Earth's fate in a larger conflict. Sounds very interesting to me and I wanted to hate this movie. Minus the Scifi, it actually sounds relatable to everybody except westerners. Every time America goes to war in somebody else's country, the inhabitants are stuck on this learning curve of trying to pick who to fight/support and who to trust while this larger struggle fucks shit up for them and the plans they had for their life. Has to be better than Wonder Underwear.",0,0,nathanieldayspring00,moY78qMJuxM,0.08684463684463684,2018-09-26 15:11:40,True,True

2018-09-27T07:32:26,"I'm sorry to hear that many people were disappointed with this trailer. Initially, I was too. Technically speaking, I don't think it's very impressive. Some of Brie Larson's lines do sound a bit flat, particularly the last line: ""I'm not who you think I am."" Heck, without context, that line also sounds very cliche, not something to end a trailer with.  However, the more times I've watched the trailer, the more times I want to re-watch it, and I think that's because we were expecting something different than we got. We need to look past the surface level stuff. I do not agree in the slightest that Brie Larson isn't oozing badass in this trailer. Perhaps she's not having to do much acting to present that cold, determined face most of the time, but I think that's kind of the point of her character. They give us just enough tidbits to make us ask questions about her origins without being able to figure out the answers. They give us just enough shots to know that she's powerful, but not enough to figure out exactly what her powers are or where she sits on the hierarchy of Marvel heroes. (I'm guessing she's upper echelon though.) They give us just enough shots to understand that this is taking place in the 90s and will involve Nick Fury before he became...well, Nick Fury. They've built up the intrigue just enough to make me want to see the film, and I suspect I'm not the only one who feels this way watching the trailer.  Also, that music is pretty phenomenal. It demonstrates that this will be a very grave story, not a funny one like Ant-Man or Guardians of the Galaxy. This is someone who I suspect is going to play a pivotal role in Avengers 4, and she is not to be taken lightly. Not the best trailer, but good enough to get me pumped, and ultimately, that's the goal.",1,0,Sonicisbadazz,moY78qMJuxM,0.15291666666666665,2018-09-27 07:32:26,True,True

2018-10-24T20:18:34,"I could live with her (captain marvel) being as strong as the guys (or even stronger), but the thing is that I suspect she will not have that much personality, because she kinda reminds me of Rey from Star Wars, who's ultra competent at ANYTHING she does. They constantly seem to portrey female hero's without any emotion other than 'cool' emotions and strong, to the point where they're hardly a human anymore. For example, if one looks types like Thor Ragnarok's Valkyrie, one could spot that for example in the shuttle you could see bruce banner and thor having expressions such as confusion, looking at bit scared and other of such 'weaker' emotions, while Valkyrie pretty much never in the movie seems to express anything other than 'badass' expressions. The males in such fiction seem to have a much wider array of facial expressions/emotions, while it seems that the only possibiliy with females is to make them emotionless badass machines. It is apparently feminist to make females 1-dimensional?  Also let's take for example the *wasp's personality* or actually *the lack of a personality* . I'm surprised no one has brought this up. Can anyone define her personality? I think it's very hard to define her personality, as she's extremely generic. Paul Rudd's Antman can be described as having being lazy, does often not do the right or smart thing, is kinda lazy, has charm, and is funny, just to name a few things. Howeever,  what exactly is Wasp's personality like? She really has no personality to speak of. It's pretty much impossible to describe her personality other than ""the generic female who is more competent than Antman"". She never makes any mistakes, never seems weak, does not really have any serious issues. She really seems like another Mary-Sue too...",91,22,P O W E R - R E D - B U L L,moY78qMJuxM,0.05565599173553719,2018-10-24 20:18:34,True,True

Strange, spiderman homecoming, black panther. Especially ant man. That was the one movie people had huge doubts about because people thought ""how the hell are they gonna make a shrinking man interesting enough and important to this universe"", and look at him now.

2018-11-22T06:23:00,"The original version of Captain Barbell depicted him as shirtless because during the more whimsical comics age in the Philippines that occurred in the 1960s (Silver Age), Mars Ravelo based the good Captain's look on circus strongmen, but with the addition of a mask. Since the original Tenteng's look was a really thin guy in a tank top (emphasizing his bony features), it was decided that Captain Barbell's ""shirtless circus strongman"" look could provide a much more dramatic contrast to his mortal persona. Recent comics depicted him wearing a long-sleeved yellow shirt instead of being shirtless.    Ravelo vent out a sort of retaliation on the Captain Marvel character. This time, he admitted doing the spoofing himself, and out came Captain Barbell.

None of the other well seasoned characters could stop Snoke (Thanos), but with her newfound and underdeveloped but somehow unlimited powers, she will single handedly wreck his shit and save the entire universe from his tyrannical rule.‚Äù  The only difference I see here is instead of being aggressive and overly motivated like Rey, she‚Äôs just angsty like Bella Swan from another ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù franchise.

This one motion picture already fkd up in the title... doesnt suprise me at all to how they would slap the title of ""Captain Marvel"" even though that's a completely different comic book hero all together, and a very significant one at that.  This movie is all about Carol Danvers aka Ms Marvel NOT Billy Batson Who was dubbed a Captain after joining an Earth Defence Force aka Captain Marvel.  This is just another marvel comic that was butchered by a political agenda with added cg... ya done fucked up again Hollywood, how are you going to fix the plot line after this one?  Maybe trash it like spiderman1,2,3?  Then just make another at the costs of billions of $$$$ just to suit politics you favor wtf just follow an already existing plot itd already outlined ffs.  Disney did buy 5000+ heroes from marvel comics but they already have stories.  GOOD ONES AT THAT.  maybe if you'd just stop and read them or atleast skim threw your dried up soul might actually shine again and you might actually sway the sheeples into a positive direction that may better society.
