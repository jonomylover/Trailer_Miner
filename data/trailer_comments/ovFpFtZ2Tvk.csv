2018-10-01T03:39:19,"I HAVE A SEPARATE SUBJECT To Mention About The POSSIBILITY Of How An African-American SUPERMAN Can Come Into Existence:  ‚ÄúFirst off, remember the cartoon movie of (All Star SuperMan) in it where at the close end of it the now insightful villain Lex Luthor had given freely instructions, and to add within them a formula of how to turn almost any guy into a Superman to a green haired hero scientist.‚Äù   It was in a huge note-book & to add 2 or three folders, and to add one of the males listed that could be compatible with the formula that is the main ingredient to the process of turning a guy into a Superman the first one chosen for the process was (Lois Lane‚Äôs) unborn son he was on the top of the list, and also there were a few more names on the list that I couldn‚Äôt make out the names of what was written down. Plus to add there might of been a few females names written down onto the list with the males names too.  So anyway there might of been names of some African-American males on the list, and so there for it would explain how there might be one, two, or three African-American Supermen that are in existence a large number of years after the death of the famous (SuperMan). An so there for if a new style (SuperMan) movie ever does get created my best bet is that the script for it might be written as a portrayal of this alternate reality that has the information to how to turn almost anyone into Super-person.  Plus to add to say there for a movie script written this way would be a proper way to explain the existence of African-American SuperMen. But yet there is another type of way to go with writing a movie script that has a African-American (SuperMan) in it; Like for instance an African-American alien race of people from another planet that is a little bit similar to that of planet: Krypton, and then in the far, far, far future the first one of this race comes to planet:Earth, & he develops some of the same type of powers that the famous former (SuperMan) had when he was once alive on EARTH.",0,0,Brian Daleske,ovFpFtZ2Tvk,0.12748510450123354,2018-10-01 03:39:19,True,True

Maybe Adonis jumps up to heavyweight?  I think this movie will be just fine.  But when I heard Dolph Lundgren was coming back, I totally had a storyline in my head, in which a sick Rocky dies in the middle of the movie, and Drago comes out of the woodwork and offers to train Adonis to fight whomever the main opponent for the movie would have been.  It would have been such a moral conflict.  This seems more like Rocky 3, 2.0.  It sort of goes against how Rocky IV actually ended, with Rocky and Drago seemingly finding mutual respect for each other.

You know I‚Äôve already started thinking about what they should do for Creed 3 (which I really hope they make) and i don‚Äôt mean like all the silly comments Creed vs Clubber Lang‚Äôs son or daughter or anything like that. I‚Äôve been thinking how can they step it up emotionally? Because this an incredibly emotional film, like most of the Rocky movies, it‚Äôs a character Drama as much as a Boxing film, and here we have a really good reason for it to because I mean Adonis is facing the son of the man who killed his Father. Now how do we level up from that? How about this, what if we find out that Donny‚Äôs mother had another son, not with Apollo, but with another man, and this Son got lost in the system whereas we know Donny got rescued by Mary Anne. So here we have this long lost brother, who see‚Äôs his little brother basically renouncing their mother‚Äôs name, and sitting pretty with a wife, kid, new mom, and new surrogate father in Rocky, so now this resentment is starting to build, so he works and works and works to challenge Adonis for the Heavyweight title in an effort to break him down and take away the things that matter most to him.
