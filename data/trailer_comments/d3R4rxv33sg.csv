NO one before him, white or black was doing what he was doing, nor made the type of money he was making. He was the first to command the type of pay he was getting, especially for African-Americans. the first one to use profanity on television. His comedy record was the 1st one to be on the R&B charts at # 1 for 5 weeks(comedy album on R & B charts). now i know they're trying to pump Kevin's status, but w/o Richard there would be no Kevin. Richard made more money in comedy than Bill Cosby. so you'll have these people who don't know the history and won't research, thinking he's the first. maybe of this generation and era but not the exact first for overall stand up comedy",0,1,Moziah Bonneau,d3R4rxv33sg,0.12948717948717947,2016-06-17 17:20:19,True,True
