Rather than use nuanced drawings to depict emotion or character, artists use shorthand symbolism. Alita's big eyes mean she's naive, good-natured, not evil, etc.  A live action film is not crude. You can use nuanced acting to depict Alita's good nature.  To replicate the big eyes in a live action shows not only a fundamental misunderstanding of Battle Angel Alita but an equal misunderstanding of manga.  This is not a movie by fans.

2018-07-24T03:08:08,"Hm... I'm not convinced. It smells a bit of the same trappings GitS fell into. In the original story Gally/Alita was a ""nobody"" at first. She wasn't recognized as special by others untill she started to make a name of her own (and attract attention). Here it looks like your standard run-of-the-mill ""you're the cornerstone of everything special"" kind of plot.   Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you have to copy-paste the manga; but you should be aware what the sotry is centered around and what makes each character's... well, character be what it is. They have archs that depend on that. Even more, here I see the absense of Desty Nova... and it troubbles me. Nova is the one who ""makes"" Gally/Alita special in many ways. It's his obsession with karma that makes him attracted to the tragic character that's Gally/Alita and he drives many of her transformations trough antagonism and pressure (not all of her archs, of course). She's not special because (SPOILERS!!!!!)...   ...she's a Martian supersoldier tech-wise, but because she has all the accumulated tragedy and karma that comes with. But she's also special because she's a good person (or wants to be one) in a world that's really shitty.   This looks too much like a standard plot where everyone wants to get her because she's the McGuffin and at the same time she's the only possible hope for everyone, because she's the McGuffin filled special saiviour.

2018-07-24T05:10:38,"Dear friends did you know that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wants you to keep your eyes on Him, not only for direction but also for empowerment. The Lord will never lead you to do something without equipping you for the task. That is why it's so important to see Jesus Christ's will and way in EVERYTHING you do. There are many burnt-out Christians who think more is always better, who deem it unspiritual to say no.    But in order for the will of God our Creator to be done, you must spend time with Him, through His Son Jesus Christ, and enjoy His presence. This is not a onerous task but a delightful privilege. Jesus Christ, through the Holy Spirit will show you the path of life; in His Presence is full of joy and at His right hand there are pleasures forevermore. Dear ones come to Jesus Christ this very moment and make Him your Lord and Savior. Make today the start of a wonderfully pure and loving relationship with our Glorious Lord and  Savior that will last for eternity. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  (Psalm 141 : 8; Psalm 16 : 11) (NKJV)",1,1,msdogooder,w7pYhpJaJW8,0.39666666666666667,2018-07-24 05:10:38,True,True

We'll see what happens but it always makes me upset when things from paper are put onto a big screen and aren't done justice. TV shows allow for better story telling and more depth but not every show has a large budget so the story still isnt done justice.

And five of them  were (wise),  and five  were (foolish).   They that were foolish took their lamps,  and took (no oil) with them: But the wise took (oil) (in) (their vessels)  (with their lamps).   (Which we know here is that, the Oil represents the HOLY SPIRIT!! And as it says in (Hebrews 1:9)<----Thou hast (loved righteousness), and (hated iniquity); therefore God, even thy God, hath (anointed thee) with the (oil of gladness) (above thy fellows). (Acts --5:32--)<----And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath (given to them) that (OBEY HIM). (2 Thessalonians 2:7-8)<----only he who now letteth will let, until he be (taken out of the way), (Which is the Holy Spirit). And then shall that Wicked one be revealed, (Who is the Anti-Christ). (Hebrews 13:5)<---- for he, (Jesus/Holy Spirit), hath said, I will never (leave thee), nor (forsake thee). (1 John 4:4)<--- Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is (he), (Jesus/Holy Spirit), that is (in you), than (he), (Satan), that is (in the world).   (The Holy Spirit Filled, Wise Virgins, will be taken and will not have to deal with the Anti-Christ, but the FOOLISH virgins will, and will have to be Killed to get into the Kingdom of Heaven.    (Revelation 6:11)<----- it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their (fellow servants) also and their (brethren), that (should be killed) (as they were), should be fulfilled.   (Revelation 20:4)<----and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God). (Jesus): I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I wish you were cold or hot. So then because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth. (Revelation 3:15). (You have to be on fire for Jesus and not for this world or YOU WILL BE LEFT BEHIND!!!)   While the bridegroom tarried,  they all slumbered and slept.   And at midnight there was a cry made,  Behold, the bridegroom cometh;  go ye out to meet him.   Then all those virgins arose,  and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise,  Give us of your oil;  for our lamps are gone out.   But the wise answered, saying,  Not so;  lest there be not enough for us and you:    but go ye rather to them that sell,  and buy for yourselves.   And while they went to buy,  the bridegroom came;  and they that were ready  went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.   (The Door was shut): Speaks of being shut out of the kingdom of heaven. The unwise virgins were not ready when Christ returned).   Afterward came also the other virgins,  saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.    But he answered and said,  Verily I say unto you,  (((I know you not))).*****   (The repetition of LORD, LORD, indicates strong emotion).   (Matthew 7:21-23)<----(JESUS): Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?   And then will I profess unto them,  (((I never knew you))):******    depart from me,  (ye) that (work) (iniquity).

Usually when producing a largely visual spectacle action flick, they need to simplify the emotional and intellectual aspects to keep the tone consistent. It's going to be weird for me if Alita doesnt crack one liners under her breath, but it would probabaly worse if she did. Action movies often cant allow characters to grow in too many directions. It exhausts the audience and muddles the character objectives. I just hope that they keep her characterization consistent with the manga. Alita as a person does not continually fall back on male characters during her growth. She doesnt ""need"" anyone to continue to move forward. It's a very feminist theme that I hope translates well in the film. TLDR: have problems, still will see.",0,0,Citizen_Butt,w7pYhpJaJW8,0.05,2018-07-24 16:18:10,True,True

Honestly there is a ton of CGI thrown at the screen here, a majority of which looks terrible. They may have been better off just making everyone CGI at this point.

2018-09-22T13:29:23,Idk. I still feel like the cgi for Alita's character seems unnecessary. Big eyes or not. I think they should have let Rosa Salazar's acting shine through and really let her own the character. It feels out of place against the human actors. And all the other cgi characters have more human like features/characteristics. But regardless the movie is still coming out in December. And I'm sure people will say how they're trying to stay true to the anime/manga. Which I love respectively. I'm not gonna go see it as I'm sure it will be another Ghost in the Shell situation for me personally.,2,2,momentsmeanmore,w7pYhpJaJW8,0.175,2018-09-22 13:29:23,True,True

I know you can't fit everything but I honestly loved Alita and Figures relationship so much and don't think they will do justice to Hugo and Alita's relationship. It will probably be a sappy romance instead of the really f-ed up complicated manga version where Hugo never truly loved Alita and Alita was unhealthily possessive of him. However the action looks good and Alita's design has grown on me. Ultimately the decision to trim out Figure and the rest is probably a good thing. Hope Ido gets a hammer.

2018-10-28T05:51:25,"I understand this is an adaptation, and the movie hasn't been released yet, but I'm worried it won't be faithful to the manga.  here's the list of differences I think I spotted. -Vector was never a full on villain in the manga, he was just a morally grey black market dealer who controlled supply lines to the scrapyard and Tiphares/Zalem. He was integral to Hugo's character development, but after that he became a reoccurring character. -The big guy with the saw blade fingers was a villain that acted independently, and was never connected to Vector. -The character Chiren is not a character in the manga, she's from the non-cannon 1993 OVA -The woman with the blade hands also is not from the manga -Zapan is also not associated with Vecter, he's a lone wolf bounty hunter (called Hunter Warriors in the story) that comes into conflict with Alita/Gally due to them pursuing the same target. (can't say anything more because there's spoilers). -Ido found and was holding onto the berserker body long before Alita/Gally showed up. He knew exactly what it was and knew it was dangerous. -In the manga, Alita/Gally destroys her ""first"" body when facing off against Makaku (saw blade fingers) for the first time, and she goes to the bar to ask the hunter warriors for help (which is also when Zapan is introduced) , and by then she has the berserker body. It doesn't seem like this is the case in the movie.  The manga is one of my all time favorites (I read all of Gunnm, Gunnm Last Order, and what was so far released for Gunnm Mars Chronicle in three days), and I wouldn't have found out about it were it not for the movie adaptation. This is an adaptation and I do believe adaptations should be able to stand on their own, no matter how close to the source material they are, I just hope that the movie isn't hurt by these story differences.",5,5,Roberto Norico,w7pYhpJaJW8,0.07549019607843138,2018-10-28 05:51:25,True,True

And this is from a person who has both read the manga and watched the animation. They have intricately woven this amazing looking world using the core of the source material itself so it looks and feels real. The character is someone you know: It is you that are trying to discover who you are and your roots, but at the same integrate your journey of discovery to your newfound self. Alita is and knows a lot, but it never stops her from becoming more and learning more; of a friend, a lover, a sibling and an older sister, a soldier and a leader. She has always been a growth minded character in the manga and the film does not fail to recognise that. That's the main reason I liked the film.

2019-02-18T04:02:58,I was a Gunnm manga fan since I was twelve years old. I have seen the cinema adaptation last week and I wasn't disappointed at all! Even if this adaptation is different from the original manga it is such a hudge masterpiece. I think they did a really powerfull job here. Even from James Cameron I wasn't sure it would be respecting my expectation that much but I sure was wrong. My only desapointment would be that it would have made such a perfect series to work even more on the complex story that Yukito Kishiro made. But with a 200 million dollars investment on the 2 hours movie I can get why it wasn't made. I highly recommend it even if you haven't read the manga you might get a little bit lost in the story by moment but it would surely be one of your favorite movie of the year in the end.,0,0,Jean-S√©bastien Chabot,w7pYhpJaJW8,0.1305,2019-02-18 04:02:58,False,True

Nothing special.  But yesterday I went to see this movie in Glasgow in IMAX, and let me tell you I was not disappointed in the slightest.   This movie exceeded all of my expectations. Even for the best movies, I usually find myself at some part losing track and wondering if the movie is going to end soon because X or Y reasons. But here, not even once. You‚Äôre born with Alita, you live and suffer her pain, you fight with her. You want to see her prosper and reach her goal just as much as she does. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. Besides the scenes that were absolutely breathtaking (can we talk about the first camera shots of the motoball game? Mesmerising), Alita herself gave more emotions than I believe any human actor could. Through the lenses of a cyborg you see more humanity than a human could ever show you.  I sincerely hope there will be a Sequel. That ending was absolutely brutal, and it pains me to know that because of lack of audiences she might not be given a proper ending.

2019-02-19T21:25:19,"I find it really funny, that cameron decided to make some changes to the story just to make it more dramatic for some reason:  -SPOILER ALERT-  . .  .  .  .  .  .  Like Alita's name. It wasn't name of his deceased daughter (btw, Ido didn't have a wife and didn't remove his mark of Zalem), but of his cat.  Or how berserker's body was found. Ido found it years ago, examined it and became furious after he discovered that it was pretty much a weapon meant to turn people into killing machines. He locked it up in his basement and after body he gave Alita was destroyed in her first fight against Makaku (where teh hell did he get Gervishka, what?), he gave it to her, so she can protect herself.  Or how Panzer-Kunst was first mentioned. In the manga Ido mentioned it when Alita fought the mutant who was killing the women (not big bad robots).  Or how she became hunter-warrior. Alita was mad at Ido that he was treating her like his dress-up doll and ran off to the Factory to get her mark of the Hunter. In the movie she goes there with hugo - who in manga doesn't appear until after her fight with makaku.  Makaku/Gervishka was not protected by zalem, he was a long-time wanted criminal, but too many hunter warriors died after trying to kill him, so every hunter warrior was reluctant to give it a go. Speech about fighting makaku/gervishka was much less dramatic and was given by Ido after he goes to Kansas bar with Alita for the first time.   As for motorball, there was a timeskip in the manga before she was in 2nd league, but it was a nice touch that they've shown how it started for her - playing with other kids on the street. What I didn't like was removal of her coach and technican guy.   Makaku/Gervishka didn't get grind cutters installed by zalem ""baddies"", he got them by literally ripping Colloseum's (popular sport on other end of Scrapyard, rivaling M0torball in popularity) head off his body and installing himself there.  There were many more minor changes in this movie that differ it's story from the manga which made it quite irritating for me to watch it.  .  .   .  Tl;dr: Movie differs from the manga so it can be more dramatic and more appealing to americans. Weird, because manga itself is a classic, full of black humor which I bet would appear to cyberpunk fans and teens alike.

2019-08-18T23:49:51,"They ran out of ideas. That's why they adapted something instead of making original stories. The developer has nothing makes him to say something, just another adaptation. Because the hollywood Ghost in the Shell had failed, I didn't watch Alita. But I didn't know how bad this one can be.     Everyone said it's good mostly because she is female. Just like ""Time to have a female president!"" Not its story telling skill like descriptive trick or the duality of a character, even a side character. The doctor (I'm not sure about the name. I didn't read it in English.) found Gally at night, not some kind of stupid morning to present hope and start. Nobody found her. He is the only one found her, and she belongs to him alone. He is the only one she can count on.     A woman was murdered. The woman was smoking, so it focused on her arm, beautiful arm. The very next day Gally has a pair of beautiful arms. The good stuff that the doctor is impossible to find in the crap yard. Then the doc promises the sleeping (He thinks so) Gally that he'll make her perfect while he is wearing coat to cover himself to go out at night. Gally is happy to have legs to make herself go out on her own, and it is the moment that she notices that women were murdered at night by warning, like cold water poured on her when she is happy. When something good happened, there is also something bad happening. She notices that doc has new wound on arm, since it's new she assumes it was caused last night, the night before the day that doc has found the legs for her. And this night Gally has her own legs to move to take action on her mind. The dark side of human. Just like the ancestor of human being is naturally hunting other creatures to feed his child to make her better.     And all of these was just ruined in the movie, since Alita got that fancy ivory color whole body in the beginning. Thanks, American. You sucessfully turned a Japanese art into an american child education. ""I was born special! I can do whatever I want if I do! By the way, I'm also a female.""
