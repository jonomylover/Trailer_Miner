Now i get it and my expectations for a decent comedy increased significantly. Body swap is always fun and challange for actors (love Jack Black and here he is gonna try to play teenage girl traped in his body) for The Rock and the rest it also is a different type of role. i kinda look forward to it now if they will keep the humour not lame (always risk of that) i just hope for some of it be targeted at older audience since its.

Plus with Jack Black, I think it will be pretty funny. But giving them special powers because they're in a video game? I understand it, but the thrill of the original was that you didn't have special powers. It was about the wild coming out to you.

People literally no longer understand the deeper language of film. That's what happens when quality is seen as subjective, cheap comedy wins the day, and empty entertainment subverts thought provoking greatness.   If you still think  this movie looks great and I'm the one full of crap, feel free to look up Bruckheimer's comments about how the reading level of movies keeps going lower and lower every year or how Tarantino complains about how studios no longer want to spend time shooting with one camera, rather they just want to do one take with as many cameras as possible to be as cheap as possible without spending the time to fully think out shots, the likes of which was crucial to the greatness of Hitchcock and Tarantino's - all of this is really happening and it's really a problem.   While this is only a trailer for the film, this looks more like a Scary Movie spoof than a movie of substance. Oh well, I'll just have to watch the original. It certainly wasn't a Kubrick film, but it had heart and a decent level of competency not to mention Robin Williams was a rather strong actor, especially compared to any role the rock has played.

F*** this movie though, and F*** Dwayne Johnson & Kevin Heart. No offense to those actors but i get pretty annoyed how these 2 actors are almost staring in every F***ing modern Movie!

Believe me, I've been a fan of The Rock since the 90's when he did pro wrestling in WWE, but the fact is that he keeps showing up in a lot of movies now a days that i get tired of looking at his face. As for Kevin Heart, I have nothing against him but he really ist as funny as Hollywood portrays him to be. There are a lot of actors that are way funnier than Kevin Heart, Jack Black being one of them. Im not saying Kevin Heart isn't funny, Im saying that he isn't THAT funny. His level of humor is more like innocent kid humor but with some profound terms that sometimes tries too hard. It sounds like im intended to insult the guy but that is truly how i see it while most people think he's funny as heck.I love Kevin Heart, he's a great actor but not a great comedian.
