I know that there are no white people alive that had anything to do with slavery and it might make some feel bad to see the type of atrocities their ancestors committed, but it is AMERICAN history. Who cares that there was slavery all over the worlds within different races. We are talking about American History here. Slavery didn't end until the late 1860's and Jim Crow lasted another 100 years after that, at least until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, meaning for a lot of black people, it's barely been 50 years since they were allow to even drink for the same water fountain, ride in the front of buses, go to the same stores, live in the same neighborhoods, work at the same place, and, most importantly, attend schools of value. There are blacks alive today that were hosed and beaten for siting at a white restaurant. JUST 50 YEARS AGO, and that's being modest.

2016-06-22T06:33:03,"Although I was anticipating the release of this film, I was disappointed after researching some information about Mr. Nate Parker. Not only was he accused of raping a female college student in 1999 at Penn State (which by no means is proclamation of guilt, but is nonetheless shocking and leaves one scratching their head), he has made it clear that he will never play a ""gay character."" He has also taken the liberty to discuss the ""emasculation and feminization of the black male"" in film and television, expressing concern ""to preserve the black man"" in media. However, he has played a gang member in the past (""Red Hook Summer"") and appears to have a non-black wife (not that there is anything wrong with this, but it is relevant to a discussion about black identity, images, and manhood/masculinity).  What does this have to do with this ""Birth of A Nation"" film, you ask? Well first, for someone so committed to telling the story of an African American man that risked his life for his freedom and the freedom of others, it seems a little close-minded, bigoted, and reductive to never consider playing a ""gay character."" Afterall, an actor or actress should have range and challenge him or herself to play characters that may be different from one's own self, especially those that are marginalized or have stories that haven't been told, right? Why completely shut the idea out without having more information about a potential progressive story in which playing a ""gay character"" may be of interest?  Second, what exactly is his ""image"" of the black male that needs to be ""preserved?"" I hope it has nothing to do with being violent, overly hostile, sexually aggressive toward women, or only desiring women that have European features. Afterall, what constitutes an ""image of a black male"" in this society is subjective and isn't a one-size-fits-all description.   Third, in a discussion about images of the ""black male,"" women (both black and of other races) usually can be connected to the conversation in some way. The right for Mr. Parker to have a fair-skinned or white wife is his; however, to single out and call in question the image of the black male and ""those with questionable sexuality"" as being an issue of ""emasculation"" is somewhat hypocritical and one-sided. If interracial love/marriage is okay (and it is!!!) and isn't emasculating or somehow doesn't devalue the 'blackness' or 'manhood' of the black man, then why must his sexuality? I'm certain Mr. Parker knows better than this. Also, when discussing slavery and black history, relationships between black men and non-black women have (historically) been a point of contention for many (which is another discussion entirely but can be extended from the current conversation).     Fourth, since he has been on the receiving end of a rape allegation in the past, I think he should also offer an impassioned opinion on rape culture on college campuses - especially since it seems to be a valid issue in 2016 (just my opinion). This would be a great opportunity to discuss how masculinity and patriarchy have been used to promote passivity of sexual assaults against women.         The point? Being selective in one's liberation or advocacy for characters with stories shouldn't be based on bigoted or prejudiced ideals. One's own liberation shouldn't disregard the liberation of others. The Nat Turner story is one of dignity, strength, courage, and equality ON A HUMAN LEVEL. The character of the man producing/re-introducing such a narrative project is relevant. You cannot uplift the triumphs of one man or woman while discounting and devaluing those of others, especially when there are stark commonalities within the human condition. People are people. Period. Gay, straight, black, white, male female, whatever. Everyone has story and no story should be devalued. Although Mr. Parker is entitled to select and play the characters he wants, his reasoning behind such should not aim to trivialize and reduce the lives of some or to reinforce the bigotry plaguing our society.",0,0,Robert Kemske,KWs5TTn19qk,0.03181268601190477,2016-06-22 06:33:03,True,True

2016-07-01T22:17:38,"1. This movie actually seems well-made... People complain that this is yet another slave movie, but this seems to take a different approach to it. Kind of like an infinitely better Free State of Jones in a slave viewpoint.  2. Black Lives Matter     Asian Lives Matter     Latino Lives Matter    Yes.... Even White Lives Matter    Everyone's Life Matters. To the people who clicked on this trailer and thought this movie was going to be great, ok. To the people who clicked on this trailer and thought this movie was going to be clich√®, ok. Congratulations on forming original thoughts and becoming a rational human being! But to judge a movie based on racial tensions or the fact that an individual has preference to one race or another is completely inappropriate or inaccurate. Yes, people have the right to learn about our history, and it is crucial that we should (in reference to George Orwell's 1984) in order to improve our society. HOWEVER, individuals also have the right to recognize certain patterns and state that they exist. Which brings me to my next point.  3. Slave movies are oftentimes excellent, but there is no doubt that some movies are made for Oscar bait. It is just a common fact. For example, The Butler. A sappy, easily forgetful movie starring Forest Whitaker about a butler who lives through eras in history. The only reason that movie existed was because it had what once was the Oscar movie formula: historical events, racial tensions/handicaps, happy ending. And the list continues. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button: all white cast, for the most part. Basically a rip-off of Forrest Gump: handicapped man falls in love with a woman and must try to set aside his differences in order to live a normal life. The only reason it was admitted into the Oscars was because it had the SAME OSCAR MOVIE FORMULA. This doesn't stop at race, it transcends that. So, there are some slave movies that were made NOT for the benefit of the people, but for the benefit of fame.  4. Finally, to those who ask themselves publicly if they have to feel white guilt, what kind of a question is that? Are you a racist? Are you considered of the white race and are you a proven bigoted racist? If so, then no, you do not have to feel white guilt. I agree that white men and women have disgraced the African-American population over history, but that is no reason to seek revenge on others because of what happened in the past. Everyone talks of equality, but if an individual is going to say, ""Hey, you remember that thing your dead great grandfather did? We're just going to remind you of it, rub it in your face, and verbally abuse you and your family for all eternity."" That, ladies and gentleman, is thinking backwards. How are we going to coincide if all there is is hate? Are the descendants from Constantinople still holding a grudge against the Turks who invaded? Are all the descendants from Russia still angry that Napoleon invaded their country, and are now taking revenge against them? No. Because it is history. We learn it, but we do not misuse it because times are always changing. Although, if you are white/latino/asian/african-american/etc. and have said or done something racist, then ignore this message. Because you should feel guilt. And learn from it. And forgive. And be forgiven. And move on.",0,0,The Dude,KWs5TTn19qk,0.13633492357982155,2016-07-01 22:17:38,True,True

2016-10-20T14:34:54,"The Forgotten European Slaves of Barbary North Africa and Ottoman Turkey. Turkish Slavery The Ottoman penetration into Europe in the 1350s and their capture of Constantinople later in 1453 opened new floodgates for slave-trade from the European front. In their last attempt to overrun Europe in 1683, the Ottoman army, although defeated, returned from the Gates of Vienna with 80,000 captives.874 An immense number of slaves flowed from the Crimea, the Balkans and the steppes of West Asia to Islamic markets. BD Davis laments that the ‚Äò‚ÄòTartars and other Black Sea peoples had sold millions of Ukrainians, Georgians, Circassians, Greeks, Armenians, Bulgarians, Slavs and Turks,‚Äô‚Äô which received little notice.875 Crimean Tatars enslaved and sold some 1,750,000 Ukrainians, Poles and Russian between 1468 and 1694. 876 According to another estimate, between 1450 and 1700, the Crimean Tatars exported some 10,000 slaves, including some Circassians, annually‚Äîthat is, some 2,500,000 slaves in all, to the Ottoman Empire.877 The Tatar slave-raiding Khans returned with 18,000 slaves from Poland (1463), 100,000 from Lvov (1498), 60,000 from South Russia (1515), 50,000‚Äì100,000 from Galicia (1516), during the ‚Äòharvesting of the steppe.‚Äô Numbers from Moscow (1521), 800,000 were taken and from Valynia (1676), 400,000 were taken. 800,000 from Moscow (1521), 200,000 from South Russia (1555), 100,000 from Moscow (1571), 50,000 from Poland (1612), 60,000 from South Russia (1646), 100,000 from Poland (1648), 300,000 from Ukraine (1654), 400,000 from Valynia (1676) and thousands from Poland (1694). Besides these major catches, they made countless more Jihad raids during the same period, which yielded a few to tens of thousands of slaves.878 These figures of enslavement must be considered in the context that the population of the Tatar Khanate was only about 400,000 at the time. (1463-1694) while sources are incomplete, conservative tabulation of the slave raids against the Eastern European population indicate that at least 7 Million European people-men, women, children were enslaved by Muslims. Sources suggest that in the few years between 1436-1442, some 500,000 people were seized in the Balkans. Many of the captives died in forced marches towards Anatolia (Turkey). Contemporary chronicles note that the Ottomans reduced masses of the inhabitants of Greece, Romania, and the Balkans to slavery,eg from Moree (1460)-70,000 and Transylvania (1438) - 60,000-70,000 and 300,000-600,000 from Hungary and 10,000 from Mytilene/Mitilini on Lesbos island (1462) (Bulgaru p 567) and so it continued. The vicious destruction of Constantinople in 1453 shows the religious zeal of the Muslims, their hatred of Christians, massacres, destruction and pillage and of course, the enslavement of 50,000-60,000 people! Turkoman Archer massacre, enslavement, exile, destruction of farming, destruction of trade, depopulation, reduced productivity, and destruction of the normal exchange of knowledge around the Mediterranean and through Christian and Jewish societies, plus colonization by Muslims---as also occurred in the conquest of Asia Minor. The states of Byzantium, Bulgaria, Serbia...had reached a high level of economic and cultural development before the Muslim attacks. The conquest of the Balkan peoples was disastrous and for centuries trammeled their normal economic and social development. Yet its described as a blessing for the population (they had the chance to become Muslim) and we are fed lies of peace and economic unity. The Turks did not have a higher culture or better civic organisation they were semi-barbarian tribes bent of pillage and war, enriching themselves with booty.(estates, slaves, money, jewels) and rendered fanatical by the dogmas of Islam Even a brief look at the date list in the slavery series, shows the violence and oppression by the Muslims! Byzantine historian Georgius Pachymeres, a contemporary of the events in the 1262-82 invasion north of the meander, (Paphlagonia, Caria in Asia Minor) described the ruination of towns and monasteries, the fleeing population and the conversion of land into a Scythian desert. He notes indiscriminate massacres, large scale enslavement, the merciless crushing of any resistance and the death of the entire male population where people refused to surrender. The 14th century Ottoman state had only a rudimentary economy with underdeveloped commerce and trades and money was rare. Enslavement served to weaken nations as populations were depleted and moved. Mass enslavement are documented. The remaining populations were severely exploited peasants who labored for others and were subjected to excessive taxes and fines. Similarly artisans were needed so, despite the routine massacres and deportations, the military was used to stop people fleeing and force them to remain. Barbary Coast Slavery Ohio State University history Professor Robert Davis describes the White Slave Trade as minimized by most modern historians in his book Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500‚Äì1800 (Palgrave Macmillan). Davis estimates that 1 million to 1.25 million white Christian Europeans were enslaved in North Africa, from the beginning of the 16th century to the middle of the 18th, by slave traders from Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli alone (these numbers do not include the European people which were enslaved by Morocco and by other raiders and traders of the Mediterranean Sea coast), 16th- and 17th-century customs statistics suggest that Istanbul's additional slave import from the Black Sea may have totaled around 2.5 million from 1450 to 1700. The markets declined after the loss of the Barbary Wars and finally ended in the 1830s, when the region was conquered by France. Hundreds of thousands of Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries. These slave raids were conducted largely by Arabs and Berbers rather than Ottoman Turks. However, during the height of the Barbary slave trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Barbary states were subject to Ottoman jurisdiction and ruled by Ottoman pashas. Furthermore, many slaves captured by the Barbary corsairs were sold eastward into Ottoman territories before, during, and after Barbary's period of Ottoman rule. The Barbary Muslim pirates kidnapped Europeans from ships in North Africa‚Äôs coastal waters (Barbary Coast). They also attacked and pillaged the Atlantic coastal fishing villages and town in Europe, enslaving the inhabitants. Villages and towns on the coast of Italy, Spain, Portugal and France were the hardest hit. Muslim slave-raiders also seized people as far afield as Britain, Ireland and Iceland. In 1544, the island of Ischia off Naples was ransacked, taking 4,000 inhabitants prisoners, while some 9,000 inhabitants of Lipari Island off the north coast of Sicily were enslaved.870 Turgut Reis, a Turkish pirate chief, ransacked the coastal settlements of Granada (Spain) in 1663 and carried away 4,000 people as slaves. In 1625, Barbary pirates captured the Lund Island in the Bristol Channel and planted the standard of Islam. From this base, they went ransacking and pillaging surrounding villages and towns, causing a stunning spectacle of mayhem, slaughter and plunder. According to Milton, ‚ÄòDay after day, they struck at unarmed fishing communities, seizing the inhabitants, and burning their homes. By the end of the dreadful summer of 1625, the mayor of Plymouth reckoned that 1,000 skiffs had been destroyed and similar number of villagers carried off into slavery.‚Äô871 Between 1609 and 1616, the Barbary pirates ‚Äòcaptured a staggering 466 English trading ships.‚Äô In 1627, Pirates went on a pillaging and enslaving campaign to Iceland. After dropping anchor at Reykjavik, his forces ransacked the town and returned with 400 men, women and children and sold them in Algiers. In 1631, he made a voyage with a brigand of 200 pirates to the coast of Southern Ireland and ransacked and pillaged the village of Baltimore, carrying away 237 men, women and children to Algiers. The barbaric slave-raiding activities of the Muslim pirates had a telling effect on Europe. France, England, and Spain lost thousands of ships, devastating to their sea-borne trade. Long stretches of the coast in Spain and Italy were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants until the nineteenth century. The finishing industry was virtually devastated. Paul Baepler‚Äôs White Slaves, African Masters: An Anthology of American Barbary Captivity Narratives lists a collection of essays by nine American captives held in North Africa. According to his book, there were more than 20,000 white Christian slaves by 1620 in Algiers alone; their number swelled to more than 30,000 men and 2,000 women by the 1630s. There were a minimum of 25,000 white slaves at any time in Sultan Moulay Ismail‚Äôs palace, records Ahmed ez-Zayyani; Algiers maintained a population of 25,000 white slaves between 1550 and 1730, and their numbers could double at certain times. During the same period, Tunis and Tripoli each maintained a white slave population of about 7,500. The Barbary pirates enslaved some 5,000 Europeans annually over a period of nearly three centuries.",0,39,HELLO HELLO,KWs5TTn19qk,0.0019450262998650118,2016-10-20 14:34:54,False,True

The author of ""The Clansman"" said that he wrote that to counter the influence that the literary, the real ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" had had. That it wasn't right for people to assume that slavery was this egregious institution and that slave owners were egregious individuals. He wanted to revisit and revise that to show how inferior blacks were and how superior white Southern planters were. While calling other black folks Uncle Tom's for stating facts who are black to represent a sell out, yet in the actual original book that sold out more than the Bible in that time uncle Tom was considered the highest character of a slave willing to die before selling out two slave women. Media is so frickin twisted I swear no wonder kids who don't study history and read and only look to media think so wrong of how things actually were and make up slang words that mean the exact opposite.

Amos 3:1-2 Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying, 2. You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. Exodus 6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. In ships. The timeline for this is about 1441 A.D. World enslavement has begun, long after our Exodus from Egypt. Exodus 20:2 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Anywhere we're taken to the four corners of the world, would be bondage like we had in Egypt. We have never been to our family's home in Jerusalem, like God said. And our oppressors are called our ENEMIES they did not act as a friend to us. Our family could not free us from bondage and yet we were sold to our ENEMIES.
