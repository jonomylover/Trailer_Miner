Now it looks like Rambo here seems to be the center of trouble and killing wherever he goes. The majority of people aren't that way. So do you think of Rambo as an unhealthy character? Someone who never really could not come to terms with himself or the lives of others. Just caught up in The Killing cycle. A product of our society.

This movie has the most cliche plot imaginable and Stallone seems to be channeling more Barney Ross (The Expendables) than Rambo. Maybe it's because of the short hair (ruining Rambo's iconic look) and the fact that he speaks more in this trailer than in previous movies :p Looking forward to it but I'm doubtful it will live up to the brilliant reputation of Rambo IV,0,0,Dirvinator,4vWg5yJuWfs,0.15498737373737373,2019-05-31 07:32:10,True,True

2019-05-31T14:48:28,"The Rambo of the 'First Blood' film disliked violence (including using it himself) and war increasingly as the movie progressed. Then the studio and/or others involved in making the Rambo franchise realized that if they put more explosions and loud ""BOOM!"" in their movies, they could draw in a large audience repeatedly even if the plot, character development, and/or other elements of the movies lacked in some way. Considering that John Rambo is a fairly old man in the upcoming 'Last Blood' story, I had hoped that maybe his character would perhaps become a little more self-reflective and go back to showing at least some signs of his old dislike (if not downright despising) of using violence as a means to reach his goals. Alas, I see no hint of that in this trailer and quite the opposite, really; he seems to know that others are bad for violently killing people Rambo loves, but then he seems to be committed to escalating things further in response, an action that the Rambo of 'First Blood' would doubtlessly not condone.",0,0,Eric Hanson,4vWg5yJuWfs,-0.017772108843537415,2019-05-31 14:48:28,True,True

Jesus said, ""Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."" Have you looked with lust? Will you be guilty on Judgment Day? If you have done those things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart. The Bible warns that if you are guilty you will end up in Hell. God, who the Bible says is ""rich in mercy,"" sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross for guilty sinners. We broke God's Law, but Jesus paid our fine. That means He can legally dismiss our case. He can commute our death sentence: ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."" Then He rose from the dead and defeated death. Please, repent (turn from sin) today and God will grant everlasting life to all, who trust in Jesus, then read your Bible daily and obey it.",0,0,Jasmine H,4vWg5yJuWfs,0.07115384615384615,2019-05-31 15:00:28,True,True

2019-07-29T21:57:15,"I saw Rambo: First Blood back in the mid-80's and the sequels during the late 80's - I was way too young, but I'm so glad I met my hero John J. back then, I've been an ardent fan of Stallone and his movies ever since. I played the video games with Commodore 64, I bought the Rambo knife, I even got a bow and three arrows and went shooting on the football field...until I had to take a break and cycle to the nearest supermarket to buy some soda with my pocket change! Oh, good memories from 30 years past...  The magic and magnetism of the classic Rambo movies has not faded away throughout the decades. I just watched First Blood again and enjoyed it thoroughly - true classics never lose their sparkle!  Rambo never wants war, he just wants peace and quiet...but when the forces of tyranny make him take a stand, he will fight it until he destroys the enemy. So there's a sense of admirable justice in these films. I know it's brutal war and I don't want war anywhere or for anyone, but the idea of defeating the outnumbering enemy for the sake of justice is truly something to admire.  Me and my friend truly enjoyed Rambo (IV) as we went to see it in the cinema. The movie was a successful continuum in Rambo's tale, a fitting battle against another tyrannical adversary.  Now this Last Blood will be one of the most anticipated movies in Stallone's canon, I really can't wait to see this!",0,0,Sabbathman,4vWg5yJuWfs,0.20814393939393944,2019-07-29 21:57:15,True,True

(very very good (not excellent but good) movie in overall aspects) 8/10 ---Rambo V Last Blood : Directed by Adrian Grunberg....what else should be mentionned ? this movie would have been SO much better is Stallone would have keep the long hair wig with Familly color Half German Half Navajo Bandana , remembering in flash back time with his grandfather learning him how to hunt with traditional bow & knife....and going to hunt the cartel inside their territory with traditional silent weapons and die after having saved the girl! ......but instead they shortened his hair , put him a achy breaky heart cowboy hat wich is a total disaster and decided to create a HOME ALONE LETHAL EDITION (but poorly executed)!!

I love the first two films and the fourth one to death. First Blood and Rambo: First Blood Part II are action classic movies favorites of mine. Rambo (2008) is my favorite and better than this movie. A lot of people love this one but hate the fourth movie and they put this movie over the fourth one I disagree. This movie is by far the worst one. I dislike it very much, it is not my couple of tea.   The third movie is way too slow it has slow action sequences. The pacing is slow. It takes 50 mins. in the movie before Rambo goes in to action. Rambo suppose to be one men army like he was in First Blood, Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rambo but in here he has help. Why? That was stupid idea. Colonel Trautman and the Mujahedeen rebels helps Rambo fighting against the Russians. This movie is so unrealistic. I don't care about Mujahedeen, Afghanistan or those people I don't. It is dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan. How many Russians soldiers did the Taliban killed in the real life? Russians did not killed 3.000 American life's in 9/11 but Al-Qaeda the Taliban Afghanistan people did. In the Thailand he was a hustler and he was fighting for money in the stick fighting. Seriously? The pacing is slow the action is slow. I like this movie less and less than I did before. Rambo has a new knife and he barely use it.

2019-10-05T04:17:30,"I was an 80‚Äôs teen. so I remember when ‚ÄòFirst Blood‚Äô 1st premiered. I first saw it on cable üì∫,; back in the day when cable channels were controlled by a small box which sat atop you TV and had a light-up plastic sliding notch to change between  10-20 channels. (The more channels, the bigger the box had to be for the slider lol).... Anyway, Rambo was an awesome weekend movie for a teen boy back then...... Fast forward to ‚ÄòLast Blood‚Äô....... Teen boy is a middle-aged man. Being so; I now have certian intellectual requirements perraining to which movies I find most watchable, appealing, or worth the money. Unfortunately, this movie (while appealing to my inner teen) holds no value for watchability or value for the buck. Why?? (Really? You have to ask,  ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù?) Ok, here it goes......  Rambo is 70 YEARS OLD!!!!  Sorry folks, but NO 70 year old living or dead, could ever street fight their way out of a circle of 20 people half his age.... not even 20 people CLOSE to their age.... REGARDLESS!   After ‚ÄòFirst Blood‚Äô , and the mainstream introduction of CGI into action flicks (remember Rambo flying up in a fiery blaze while strapped in a jet fighter pilot seat after ejecting from a Harrier jet which was parked on the tarmac in order to escape the massive explosion of the plane?)... Rambo‚Äôs  abilities and survivabilities became increasingly more ridiculous and absurd which each new flick.....  Now, with ‚ÄòLast Blood‚Äô as a viewer I‚Äôm required to believe the LUDICROUS!!   Sorry fellas.... But, if this movie appeals to your intellect, then you‚Äôre either a fat-ass kid, a retard, a delusional senior-citizen, or some fake-ass, wanna-be, Vietnam Vet looking to  steal valor in order to ‚Äòimpress‚Äô and molest some young boy in a darkened movie theater......  What‚Äôs next..... ‚ÄòFirst Blood: LAST BREATH‚Äô ??...... No, let me guess..... Next will be ‚ÄúFirst Blood: RAMBITCH‚Äù üòÇüòÇ The revenge of Rambo‚Äôs transgender, thundercunt grandaughter in all her glory as a modern-day social-justice warrior out for first blood against the evil white patriarchy!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ",0,0,William Bonney,4vWg5yJuWfs,0.06435078322285354,2019-10-05 04:17:30,False,True

And some of the acting and writing seems really bad and unconvincing.

Fans hope one day it will be released on DVD. 4) Rambo First Blood Part II made over $300 million Internationally against a $44 million budget. 5) Rambo Last Blood made around $91 million against a budget of $50 million, however that excludes DVD/blu ray, etc sales.",0,0,CloudsBeyond,4vWg5yJuWfs,0.22211538461538463,2020-02-22 11:26:38,False,False

I personally loved it, and I did a little rambo research and binge watching after seeing it so I could have a real opinion, I feel it was well written and VERY well acted, because the director had more emotional and humanizing moments for John Rambo than in some of the other movies, and for a movie titled ""last blood"" I feel these moments are fitting because this is his last time acting as the legend he was, modern day critics expect female power and ""oh make everything happy and equal"" when that isn't reality, this movie is incredibly realistic, John Rambo is a smart military man who is after revenge for his step-daughter. Why is it realistic? because if someone drugged me to the point of death and the men who did it were after my MOM, she would do the same fucking thing, cause SHE is a smart military woman who fought in a war, she fought in Iraq, and trust me she has been in combat, and if she can take down her own son who was an inch taller than her, and with a bad back, shoulder, knees, and messed up head from all the explosions shaking her brain around?  No doubt in my mind she could do what he did, possibly more since she was in the army for 20 YEARS. What I'm trying to say here is that this is a realistic, emotional, and epic finale to a great movie series that many people sadly don't understand because they want either all action and no story or woman power and equal representation.",1,0,Fluffie,4vWg5yJuWfs,0.10159252297410191,2020-04-28 19:57:11,False,False

Jesus paid the punishment for our sins against a Holy God. Then He rose from the dead 3 days later. Cry out to God for mercy, confessing and forsaking your sins. Out your trust in Jesus rather than good works or religious traditions to save you. Read the Bible and obey what you read. Please don't be mad, I really care about you and everyone else who reads this. Take care and have a great day, week or weekend. God bless. www.redeemeraz.org",0,0,Eric M,4vWg5yJuWfs,0.22419786096256686,2020-06-10 02:10:23,False,False
