Harry Potter was the exception because it was on another level when it came to popularity. But even then, the studio wanted to do massive changes to it. The Spook Series is not popular enough, so it's probably why the studio went the route of making the main character older and jamming as much fantasy stuff into it as they could. Because they know something like this will interest more people. Now if I had a choice, I would have gone with the series to see it play out that way, but I fully understand why they did what they did.

Well, when you go to see such movie, you dont expect much in terms of narrative, but at least you hope for some good action. This particular movie lacks both. Story is somewhat lame, I feel like its a poor attempt at copying the witcher novel. And combat? For the most time its one character slaughtering others. Pretty much no duels whatsoever. And when you get one at the beginning, its more of a brawl since they dont even use weapons alot, fists mainly. Rest of the movie consists of poor acting, and not very well written dialogue. Costumes are also terrible, at least for main cast (which is suprising as there are a few decently outfitted background actors. It's even more weird considering they set out on a quest to the main camp of the badies to slay them all. Despite that, they dont see fit to put on some decent armor, and the main character constantly runs around in some rags stylised after modern hoodies.... Oh and the most badass of all evil guys (the one with 4 hands) dies stabbed in the back with a glowy staff after duel with another character which lasts for just a few seconds... So yeah. 3D sucks ballz as well, its more of a 2,5d (watched in IMAX). Overall I dont recommend this movie to anyone.﻿",0,0,Verithiell,TXiNkOjM7oM,-0.0049549549549549555,2015-01-26 20:44:20,True,True

2015-02-05T09:55:47,I have seen this add like 50 freaking times. Every time I watch a video on YouTube I have to sit thru this stupid trailer. At first it seemed cool but I have seen the trailer so many times that I am sick of looking at it. Plus the story is so obvious. Jeff bridges again plays the role of the mentor who has been doing his job for years and who will proceed to make fun of his new prodigy. This new guy will also have some stupid love story with some chick that he will probably bang at some point in the movie. There will be a couple of fight scenes with monsters but the majority of the movie will be the back and forth banter of bridges and the other guy. The other guy will save the world and completely win over the love of that random chick it is sad how predictable these movies are. And I didn't even know this was based on a book until I read a comment on this trailer so no I haven't read any book. Its just so blatantly obvious what is going to happen. Basically if u watch this trailer u basically have seen all the jokes in the movie and at least a part of all of the fight scenes.

2015-02-11T01:35:29,"I was really excited when I learned one of my favorite book series was going to become a movie. However, they completely crapped on it. I say this because just looking at this trailer tells me all I need to know. I would have been fine if it was just a few changes but they changed the whole god dame story. In the series, Tom is about 12-13 and he is trying to learn how to deal with creatures of the dark by a man who btw is not a knight but a Spook whose pretty much avoided at all costs by normal people because they are scared of them. He wears no armor or fights with a sword. He uses a staff with a hidden blade, salt, iron, and puts evil beings in pits. Plus, wouldn't we all like to watch a movie where the devil is involved. His whole goal is to try to make Tom join his side so he can rule the world forever or have one of his children kill him so he can rule for about 100 years. Now doesn't that make for an interesting story cuz all i see is random monsters and no plot what's so ever. Furthermore, Alice is a bad ass witch in training who btw is a vital character in the story, doesn't look like she is going to be playing much of a role in this crap feast. I may watch this movie one day but as of right now I would not like to spend good money watching it in the theaters and being completely disappointed. Speaking of bad ass where is my favorite witch assassin Grimlikin in this piece of shit movie? I need some knife throwing awesomeness XD She doesn't appear in the first book but they might have as well added her considering their changing everything. It's not about fantasy world crap. Its about powerful monsters and evil gods who a teen boy is trying to defeat in order to save the world from darkness while he has family problems to deal with and learns he is no ordinary 7th son of a 7th son. The series is like mixing Percy Jackson with Hairy Potter. PURE AWESOME MAGIC. This movie is like mixing crushed dreams on a shit pile of disappointment.  But seriously, I get it that sometimes you need to change the story up because you can't put the whole story in a movie. It's suppose to entertain people not bore them. Especially considering their is like 13 books in the series I could have seen them combining parts of the story and maybe leaving some not so important books out. But when you change a book completely, all that does is ruin something that was already good. However, if you still add the basic important parts to the story and take out or change small stuff the movie can still be really good. A perfect example for me would be the Book Thief. I felt the same emotions watching the movie as I did reading the book and they didn't follow the book completely. They changed stuff and they took lots of stuff out but I still enjoyed it. Another example for me was Vampire Academy. Watching the trailer pissed me off. I thought the movie was going to be utter crap but they were faithful to the story and added some mean girl elements to it as well which made the story even more interesting. By the end I got excited for the next installment which is going to go from funny to dark pretty quickly when the second book happens. I am so excited to see my two favorite characters show up in the next movie XD GO ADRIAN AND EDDIE......when i first read the story I was a Demitri fan but after reading Bloodlines, Demitri is like in third place not even. Anyway, back to the main topic at hand. That's what makes good movies is by being faithful to the story but also adding their own elements to the story because as much as people love the Lord of the Rings, they don't want every book to movie adaption to be 3 hours long. So I get it but as a fan to the story, I'm truly disappointed at their course of action,",3,1,Simplicity1511,TXiNkOjM7oM,0.08122294372294372,2015-02-11 01:35:29,False,True

This movie is not going to make your brain bleed all Vanilla Sky style. And that's not a bad thing once in a while. A great cast, but this was not a super great movie for a great cast. I do not blame the cast for this. I feel like they were not given the opportunity to fully bloom into their roles. Yeah, I think that's what I wanted to say. Just don't think too much about it. If I was a kid I would have loved the s**t out of this. Great effects and the whole thing moves along at a fairly decent clip. One thing, though, I did find Mr. Bridges character in this film to be a bit...stilted. Maybe that was just me; I do consider myself to be a Jeff Bridges fan. I've seen him do better things...like Starman! Starman is one of my favorite movies of all time! :)  I would definitely recommend watching this on Netflix (when it comes out on netflix) if you like a fun, easy movie and are not too critical an audience (read: nit-picking). :) You'll have to judge for yourself if this would be worthy of your hard-earned cash. Keep in mind, though, that I am a fairly forgiving member of the public. If you want to go see something fun with your friends or children that's not depressing, go for it. This movie is definitely for a younger audience than I (35). Seeing as how this is based on a book series I got the feeling that a lot was left out.

2017-02-08T23:49:47,"This film was a giant middle finger to anyone who read the books, the final kick in the balls was when they made Alice look like some kind of Disney princess. The author sold out hard.  Because it's ridden with Hollywood cliches. But most importantly; it's not that much of a liberty when films slightly deviate from the source material they're based on but the trailers have made it seem that the directors, producers and script writers were having a laugh when they  Heavily imply the Spook is a drunk when he drank alcohol once in the entire series to cope with the pain of being isolated and the loss of his loved him. Tom being a 30 something man when he's meant to be 14, I get that more often than not child actor=bad but at least cast someone under 20 who looks...like a kid. Mother Malkin appears to be some vaguely dark magical warrior Lady/ 'Witch' that turns into a damn Dragon or some s*** when she's meant to be a downright revolting, grotesque evil Witch that crawls through mud and filth who commits monstrous acts like murdering infants and townsfolk to get there blood to strengthen her magic and is absolutely terrifying and who's relatives are no better. Speaking of which where the hell are Lizzie and the abhuman Tusk? Gregory doesn't appear to have a problem killing Witches when he's supposed to be a 'no killing' character who uses another approach like burying dead Witches into the ground with metal iron bars upside down so they get confused about which way is up and start tunnelling. Why, my gosh just why is there a love story between Tom and Alice?? They don't even barely register each other as maybe/ kind of liking each other until the fifth book and she doesn't look like a Disney character, she doesn't wash her hair for months, go's through mud and wears pointy shoes. In the book she's borderline evil. Tom doesn't seem to be that scared when he's meant to be outright feeling out of his league and wondering why this is happening to him especially during the first thing the Spook makes him to do in the book, which doesn't even appear to be in the film. Where are Tom's family.... The tone, atmosphere, character personalities and setting have almost completely changed from the source material as well as the lore, there are no freakin dragons, evil Witches and folk lore creatures are there, people get killed brutally by actual creatures of horror not that thing from Wrath of the Titans or... big animals. You're supposed to be terrifiedas it's horror but given what we're shown and the arcs that are meant to happen in the future this trailer makes this film out to be a joke and an even worse great series adaptation to screen than Percy Jackson IMO.",5,1,Fox,TXiNkOjM7oM,-0.05033068783068783,2017-02-08 23:49:47,False,False

Plus to add I was most disappointed that the movie of (SEVENTH SON) wasn’t a big hit at the Box-Office of all the MovieTheaters with everyone who had seen it.   An so I strongly think & feel that the story of (SEVENTH SON) movie should either get rebooted, or get made into a show series; An if a show series might get considered, and than I can imagine two different versions of the show series, and there for I can imagine either a cartoon show series, or a live-action show series could get made of it.  Now if a show series of the story book set of (SEVENTH SON) than I suggest that the writers for the show series should try to stay close to the way it is in the story books set of it; An I hope that if a cartoon show series is made of it than hopefully the writers might have a better chance at keeping to the original written telling of (Seventh Son) story books set.",0,0,Brian Daleske,TXiNkOjM7oM,0.2631944444444444,2020-02-15 04:51:37,False,False
