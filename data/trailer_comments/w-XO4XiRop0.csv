2014-03-19T08:10:10,"@Joey Sikora Myself, I've got a crush on MALEFICENT HERSELF, not Angelina Jolie. Angelina can go to hell for all I care! ALL my love interests are dragons or, in the case of Maleficent, other beings who can ""morph"" into a dragon ""form"", so to speak. Being one of said creatures, (I go around disguised as a human by day, but once night falls, my TRUE form; that of the Dragon King, is revealed!) I am uniquely qualified to have this sort of a ""crush"". However, by Ancient Dragon Law; neither dragons, nor dragon ""polymorphs"", are allowed, under ANY circumstance, to mate with any NON-Magical being. So your chances of satisfying your ""crush"" on Maleficent, if that's who it's on, is pretty much zero. (Well, to be honest; you have a zero percent chance regardless of the target of your crush, regardless whether it's Angelina or Maleficent).",1,0,Kerry Freeman,w-XO4XiRop0,0.3041666666666667,2014-03-19 08:10:10,True,True

2014-03-20T02:36:04,"That's the problem. Maleficent had no redeeming qualities whatsoever and is perhaps the one Disney villain not named Chernabog who was known to be pure evil. Maleficent is my favorite Disney villain for precisely that reason.   In this film notice how her curse now only puts Aurora to sleep instead of actually killing her. (Merryweather's gift was what reduced the curse to sleep.) Despite what we've seen in parts of these trailers, it's obvious that this film is trying to play down Maleficent's wickedness enough to actually make her seem redeemable. She's supposed to die by being stabbed in the heart during her faceoff with Charming; somehow I doubt that's going to happen here. What this movie is attempting to do is borderline character assassination.  Nevertheless, it looks cool and I'm sure I'll enjoy it if I overlook the original Sleeping Beauty film and Maleficent's portrayal in it.

There have been so many movies out recently where the villain HAS to be the tragic anti-hero that, in truth, is supposed to make us feel like she did nothing wrong. I was honestly expecting a turn-around with this where Maleficent is truly evil as can be, stealing the spotlight from every scene.  Now, from this trailer at least, we're getting some BS that Maleficent was actually ""misunderstood"" and that the King was the true evil! Oh lord... We do see her killing people in droves and sending in dragons (and not turning into one herself -_- ), but they still have the undertone of her being a fallen angel by someone else's evil. Why can't we just have a good Frollo villain again? I would love to see another Disney villain that takes evil to the next step.  Also, the CGI looks relatively poor. This is the same fantasy battle stuff used over and over in such terrible movies as Jack the Giant Slayer, Hanzel and Gretel, etc. Granted, the Lord of the Rings used CGI mixed with action, but then it was hard to tell what exactly was conventional effects and what was animation. Here, it all just looks really animated.  On that note... I feel less tempted to watch this. In the end I will probably go see it anyway, but now it just seems overly-pretentious.

In the original Disney movie, Maleficent was portrayed as evil because the movie was in the perspective of the three fairies. They saw Maleficent as a heartless monster and saw themselves as good parents for Aurora.   This movie, however, is in Maleficent's perspective where she sees herself as a misunderstood fairy trying to protect what is rightfully hers. Meanwhile, the three fairies are portrayed as ""neglectful and superficial"" towards Aurora.   Lastly, the movie changed the three fairies from the original movie because Maleficent never really knew that much about the fairies. Therefore, their names, appearance, and behavior had been changed for this movie.  (Sorry this message was so long).",4,1,ArtistRG34,w-XO4XiRop0,0.02,2014-03-22 01:45:06,True,True

In the original movie, it was Merryweather who lessened Maleficent's spell intended to kill the princesses into a sleep. That scene was Maleficent's establishing character moment. Not get invited to a party? Fucking murder the princess!  This change in that line together with other lines she tosses in the trailer makes me think this movie is going for a ""tragic fallen heroine"" like approach, like what Star Wars prequels did to Darth Vader with the difference that Vader at least had a redemeable moment in the originals when he killed the Emperor. But here... I mean, we are talking about Maleficent! No matter what Disney canon you are talking about whether the Disney's Channel ""House of Mouse"" show or Kingdom Hearts, she is always portrayed as the Mistress of All Evil. I will find it very hard to buy her gray morality attitude in this one.   And on the other hand, I am willing to give this movie a chance. Maybe this ""not so evil"" scenes are nothing but Maleficent being crafty and manipulative in which case, bravo Disney. I mean, at first I was very skeptical when I heard they casted Angelina Jolie, but watching the trailer now I think she did a spot on job (and appeared to had a blast doing so), so maybe the movies story will end up surprising me too.",1,2,lezard2102,w-XO4XiRop0,-0.20596064814814818,2014-03-22 10:13:53,True,True

At least Jolie does a decent voice, though there will never be an equal to Eleanor Audley. And they're STILL not letting us hear her laugh!

I understand why Jolie was cast as Maleficent because she's a box office magnet, but she has NEVER been a good villain nor a decent one... she has always played whiny females with emotional or mental issues, who just needs to be loved and hugged; Maleficent, to me, has always been a badass psychopathic bitch who doesn't want or need your pity nor love, and should of been portrayed by a stage actress with a commanding voice, like Eleanor Audley had.   I feel the casting was wrong, Jolie seems to be a weak in her acting and her voice doesn't create fear nor commands respect, but sounds like a whinny white woman on her period.

Maleficent rises to become the land's fiercest protector, but she ultimately suffers a ruthless betrayal, an act that costs her wings and turns her pure heart to stone becoming ""The Mistress of All Evil."" Bent on revenge, Maleficent faces an epic battle with the invading King's successor and as a result, places a curse upon his newborn infant Aurora that upon her sixteenth birthday she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a sleep like death.  Over the next sixteen years Maleficent comes across the young princess many times and comes to realise that Aurora may hold the key to peace in the kingdom and perhaps to Maleficent's true happiness as well. She befriends the princess in hopes of keeping her away from the curse she placed upon her.  (Source: Disney Wiki)",2,0,Abbey Bominable,w-XO4XiRop0,0.06761904761904762,2014-04-01 02:01:54,True,True

I'll check out this movie because of Angelina Jolie alone, in the trailers, she does a damn good job portraying the character Maleficent.   What's next, are going to get a live-action Snow White prequel about the evil Queen?

This is something we will learn in life guys, villaines are actually the one who teaches us not to turn like them or we'll suffer for our entire lives, not everything is a happy ending, everyone makes poor choices in life, not everyone are strong enough to battle against anger and revenge, and accept our imperfection and mistakes then forgive ourselves for that and the only person who can truly save us from such anger is ourselves.",2,0,Aizel Suyo,w-XO4XiRop0,0.07380952380952384,2014-05-29 01:38:27,False,True

Second (this is more of an acting part) The King. I've seen Sharlto Copley act as a villain, and this wasn't his best performance. Look at him in Elysium: Outstanding performance. In this movie, I wouldn't even call him ""mad"" and lastly, the message. Disney always has a great message in the end. In this one, well, there was none. Look at frozen, Wreck it Ralph, etc. They all have great messages about Family, love and friendship. Maleficent had none of it which greatly disappointed me. I wanted an ending that made me say: Wow, that's deep. But there was nothing. I expected something great from Maleficent, but there just wasn't anything. Just cliche moments, Lousy action, and major plot holes. The only good things in this film is the performance by Angelina Jolie, and the visual effects.

God loves all and forgave paul for killing christians and will forgive anyone who repents and comes to him. so please brothers and sisters, this is a brilliant movie and you are missing the point. we can make mistakes and no matter how big those mistakes are, they don't permanently scar us and they don't make us who we are. we make us who we are and we can choose to do good and be good even if we have done evil.

I know I'm going to get kicked in the teeth for that statement, but let me follow it up by saying that I truly am looking forward to seeing this movie, and I have been since I first heard the rumors going around.    I had no doubts that Angelina had the look to pull this role off, but her soft voice was a bit of concern for me.  Out of all Disney's animated classics, ""Sleeping Beauty"" remains to be my favorite.  I have become so accustomed to the wonderfully theatrical, and ""throaty"" tone of Eleanor Audley's voice for Maleficent, that anything less - to me, would be unacceptable.  I have the same sentiment for Pat Carroll's Ursula from, ""The Little Mermaid""  With a villain as evil as Maleficent, there needs to be just the right amount of depth and ""threat"" -- and maybe even a little ""husk"" to the voice to convince the audience that they are ""not to be messed with"".  When Walt was alive, he had such a knack for picking just the right voice for his villains - which is why Disney ALWAYS had the best villains, because a story is only as good as its villain, right?  Now, with all of that said, I will say that this doesn't change my wanting to see the film by any stretch of the imagine, because I know I'll love it regardless because Maleficent is one of the greatest villains of all time in my book, and I can't wait to see it.  ...and so, that's my two cents worth, lol.",0,0,D.R.

Nothing in the plot makes any sense; and don't try to say that it's because it is a kids movie. Kids movies may be fantastical, but the actions and motivations behind the characters tend to make logical sense to real people. Not in Maleficent, where people fall into betrayal ""just cause why not"". Fairy = good. Man = bad. Again, men come off as untrustworthy, power hungry snobs, so soon after ""Frozen"" just made the exact same point. I should point out that while man was the aggressor in the film (for no particular reason other than just because why not randomly attack some fairy folk), Maleficent is the only person in the movie to actually kill anyone. She murders like 30 dudes. The men try to kill fairies but never succeed. So she technically is the villain. But also the poor, poor, misunderstood good guy. Are all bad people actually just misunderstood heroes? That's what Disney wants us to believe. That's like saying Hitler was just misunderstood. This film is as feeble as all of the other attempts by Disney to ruin the it's classic animated franchise and turn them into regurgitated live-action plot-less garbage. ",7,14,WackySwacky,w-XO4XiRop0,-0.01964285714285714,2014-06-03 04:54:21,False,True

Instead I get this ""dead sleep, true kiss"" nonsense. You know what else didn't happen? The 3rd fairy never gave Aurora her gift.

It's a lovely story, I don't deny it sad that Maleficient was betrayed by the first human she met and loved. But the story was told in a very straight put way. I really hated the narrator part. To me it felt like ""let's not waste time building up the characters and just tell what is happening"". Especially the part of Maleficient's relationship with the human. It was really rushed. Like you don't see muh of their friendship growing into love. The narrator just says it. And I dunno it feel a little lazy. Like in the end, never felt like the kingdoms were joined. You just saw te king die and then you see aurora crowned. You barely saw what life in the human world is like to compare. I guess it's assumed but you barely see any common folk life except for the maids cleaning, doing laundry, spinning in spindles. The movie was still beautiful. I fell in love with the creatures!

2014-06-11T03:47:00,"I did not like this movie, and probably I will never know why did people like it. My question, what was the purpose of this movie? What did it want to be? What did it want to tell?  So, you mean to tell me, this is a good fairy, the protector of the Moors, a nice girl/woman, and a misunderstood character who is actually not evil and such things, but she has a demon's wings and horns, and to put the cherry on the cake, her name is Maleficent?! Who would trust anyone who has evil looks and an evil name? If she has been that since they-don't-explain-when, she should be misunderstood from the beginning. What is next? Some little cute innocent looking-girl whose name is ""The Backstabbing Satanic Gore-Loving Little Rapist and Homicidal Psychopath""?  I presume that you wanted to see the Sleeping Beauty from Maleficent's point of view. Maleficent razing kingdoms to the ground, transforming into a dragon (a dragon like Smaug from The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. It doesn't matter what you think of that movie, that dragon's voice and looks were impressive), doing evil things for fun... this movie is not that. It is like an altered, twisted and totally changed version of Disney's The Sleeping Beauty (I put Disney's because I know there are more versions), and I give credit for some characters having PERSONALITIES (especially Maleficent, even if I did not like her story here), but Phillip... even a stone has more personality than him in this film.  There are characters that you do not know if they are good or evil until the end (Like Snape or Itachi Uchiha) but here it did not work. THIS made me hard to take the movie seriously.  Maleficent secretly raises and saves Aurora's life in multiple occasions, so she would fall in an eternal sleep or die when she became 16 so she has her revenge on her ex-boyfriend. Does anybody think this makes sense? Sparing someone to kill her?  This movie had potential, but most of it was wasted. If it was the biography of Maleficent while being loyal to the 1959 version (her being killed by Phillip rather than remaining alive for example, and regardless of them making her a villain like in the 1959 movie or an anti-hero or misunderstood character), better writing and less CGI this would be a stronger movie.  The positive things about this movie are that the visual effects for the Moors were beautiful (but its creatures were terrible. Seriously Hollywood, stop abusing the CGI, even Roger Rabbit's cartoons were more believable than that), the actors were very good (but Stephan had a funny accent), and the fights and background music were very, very good.  My score is 50/100.  My biggest fear with this movie is that new generations will see Maleficent as good, or evil-looking good, instead of the charismatic yet poor in personality version of 1959.   *SPOILER ALERT*  The solution to Aurora's eternal sleeping was recycled from Frozen. I hope the next time that can be solved like that they are more specific in what kind of love they mean (eros, philia, storge, agape).",49,51,Alchemisterius,w-XO4XiRop0,0.11258126721763083,2014-06-11 03:47:00,False,True

I can say without a doubt that it was not the best film - or even the best story - ever, but I still found it interesting and entertaining and would definitely see it again.  The *only* problem I have a problem with when it comes to those who feel the opposite, however, is that so many keep saying that it was not true to the original story, or were under the impression it was a remake of Sleeping Beauty. a) It's called *Maleficent* for a reason. and more importantly... b) Pretty much the first line of the film is the narrator outright stating that the film is *a retelling of an old classic* - a *reinterpretation*. If you came out of that cinema angry about lack of faith to the original after hearing that within the first sixty seconds of the film, you're just an idiot.

I watched this movie, and things are very clear in it. ""Men are greedy assholes who attack and oprime women."" The movie doesn't say ""humans"" it explicitly says ""men"" are like that. Even the prince is an useless buffoon.  The sad part is to see nowadays boys leaving schools for not fitting in this male hate paradigma. Men are only 40% of college students. They are 80% of suicide victims, 85% of homeless, 90% of victims in homicides, 98% of deaths in labor accidents. They fight and die in wars or come back home mutilated. They suffer in divorce courts which can't see their right to be with their children. They lose everything in divorces and have to pay alimony.

2018-06-25T05:14:43,"Honestly, this movie is so emotional in presenting the audience the message between the relationship of father and daughter, also with her father's love and nemesis (Maleficent). Angelina Jolie's acting was exquisitely displayed in such a brave and vigorous manner, while the director actually presented good camera shots AND a tremendous happy ending in contrast to the 1959 film 'Sleeping Beauty'. But what really positions us, the audience, about this film is that we should cooperate with the villains. We should love them, in any way, just what a Christian is taught *not racial*. And so, with Aurora thanking Maleficent for raising her, the ending is the one I'm thinking of that leaves us in tears in terms of happiness.  P.S. I forgot to mention, but King David used to be Maleficent's true love at the start. Sad that he changed roles from being Maleficent's lover to her enemy.",1,0,nineteenmaynineteeneighty,w-XO4XiRop0,0.3601851851851852,2018-06-25 05:14:43,False,False
