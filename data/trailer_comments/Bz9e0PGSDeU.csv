Okay, let's do this.  - 1) San Andreas is a strike-slip transform fault.  It moves side-to-side, not apart.  The worst the Rock would have to face is a 10 meter off road excursion in his fancy, product-placed pickup truck. - 2) The Pacific Plate is the one pushing up, meaning that LA wouldn't fall a few feet, it would rise a few feet. - 3) LA will not rise a few feet -- it would move north a few feet. - 4) Yes, the destruction of the cherished Hollywood sign is the scariest thing the Rock could witness -- unless you live near the sign in which case you're probably thrilled because now the tourists won't be traipsing through your yard anymore.  That is, of course, until someone -- you know -- stands the letters back up. - 5) Technically, any earthquake larger than a 7.0 can be felt around the world -- including the ""East Coast"". - 6) It is IMPOSSIBLE for an earthquake to cause a center-bulge failure in an arch-gravity dam. - 7) 1:35 - Everybody down.

There has never been a 10.0 EVER on Earth. It is known the San Andreas Fault is long overdue for its next earthquake. Ask any Geologist, who isn't trying to just scare or placate you, but tell you like it is, they are literally taking bets it will be over 9.0 and how far.  Even modern structures in California today will fail because quite simply the topology of the state will change enormously. The seeming unreality of the land behaving like water is VERY possible. Just as Japan. It is however extremely unlikely Califiornia will slide into the sea. That simply is NOT how the geology of Earth works.  The part about the East Coast feeling the earthquake is not unfounded. But again it does not seem likely the San Andreas quake itself will cause any real damage beyond Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon and other directly adjoining states. Hawaii is going to have to brace for a HUGE Tsunami. But just as problematic is the North American Continent is riddled with faults. Many of these faults are considerd or known to be geologically active, that is they are building up to a large quake themselves.  It is known even a small quake can excite other, relatively nearby, faults into releasing their quakes. It is very possible the so-called ""big one"" could cause continent wide earthquakes ranging from very minor 1.0 to major 6.0 or higher quakes.  As absurd as ""2012"", which was no holds barred an absurd movie (spoiler: the Earth literally tries to turn itself inside out and the only way to survive it is to escape to space. No I have NOT seen it.), San Andreas is actually more worrying even scary because it literally could happen tomorrow. Sorry, if you want to dig on the movie because it makes you feel somehow superior, and it probably is ""not good"", but this sort of movie makes me very curious about what really is and could really happen.

2014-12-10T20:54:53,"1) The San Andreas does not run under, or even that close to, downtown LA.   (Of course, that does not preclude damage to downtown, mainly from other faults that may ""sympathetically"" blow if the earthquake on the San Andreas is strong enough, but it means the damage ON the San Andreas will not DIRECTLY cause that damage) 2) Many of the buildings in downtown were either built to the tougher standards enacted in the 1970s, or retrofitted.  (Of course, that doesn't mean they can't be earthquake-damaged.) 3) The San Andreas fault line itself is not capable of producing more than an high 7 or 8 earthquake; while this sounds high, and it is, it is not the 9.5 or 10 that is generally depicted in disaster films. 4) The Richter scale rating and the damage are determined by how much of the fault blows, not how much shaking there is.  There is another scale for that.  In the disaster scenarios they predict for the Cascadia Subduction Zone (N. Cal up to Vancouver, BC, including Portland and Seattle), they routinely predict a mag 9 earthquake.  Why? Because they predict practically the ENTIRE subduction zone to blow, which means that the ENTIRE fault running from N. Cal to north of Vancouver, BC will blow.  There are plenty of videos you can watch on YT to get an idea of this.  Look for ""Cascadia Subduction Zone"".  The last major earthquake on that fault WAS a 9.0, and it hit on Jan 26, 1700.  They have studied this fault line intensively, and it involves the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate.  Because that plate is small by geologic standards, it is easier for the entire thing to blow.  The studies they've done have determined that the AVERAGE length of time between eruptions is around 300 years, so technically, we are overdue.  IMHO in terms of geological time, 300 years isn't much.  We are also way overdue for the southern branch of the San Andreas to blow, and the concern is mainly from Palm Springs to Riverside, under which the fault line runs DIRECTLY.  I remember one time we were in Palm Springs and the San Andreas DID blow, but it was a very small earthquake (around 4)  So keep in mind how much of ""San Andreas"" is fact and how much is theatrics, hysterics, and how much is marketing.",2,0,bckm54,Bz9e0PGSDeU,0.0728888888888889,2014-12-10 20:54:53,True,True

2014-12-10T21:11:10,"Guys, have you watched the news recently?  If you haven't noticed yet... the world's a mess. A huge mess. Beheadings, school shootings on a rampant scale, fake bomb threats to get out of class, race wars, rioting, earthquakes and erupting volcanoes on a scale never before seen, etc. It's crazy out there. And coincidentally, all of these messes and problems we see everyday in the news were actually prophecied in advance by Jesus Christ and the Bible over 2000 years ago. It's just one of many proofs that the Bible is divine (coincidentally, no other religious books predict the future as specifically as the Bible does. The Qur'an made a few but they're vague and some turned out to be false. The Bible has a 100% accuracy track record when it comes to prophecy and future events).  This all means that Christ is about to return, whether you believe it or not. Which is great if you're saved but it'll be hell on earth if you aren't. You don't want to be left here for the Tribulation period.  Many prophecies will reach fulfillment during the Tribulation period, but we can see right now that all the end time signs foretold by Jesus and His prophets have emerged and are converging. Here are some of these signs:  ·         Israel has become a burdensome stone and is at the center of the world’s attention. ·         Unrestrained anti-Semitism is forcing more and more Jews to return to Israel. ·         Israel is literally surrounded by enemies who want to destroy the tiny nation.  ·         The nations that will participate in the upcoming wars are aligned as prophesied in the Bible. ·         Everywhere you look ethnic group is against ethnic group. ·         Wars and rumors of wars abound on earth. ·         Russia has risen, has a hook in its jaw and is allied with Iran. ·         There are many false religious movements and false prophets. ·         The kings of the east are a threat. ·         The Euphrates River can be dried to a trickle due to the Ataturk Dam, which will prepare the way for the kings of the east. ·         There is a move towards global religion, global government, and global economy. ·         Global communication is in, increase in knowledge ·         Ability to travel to and fro in all the earth ·         Nuclear capability ·         Signs in the sky ·         Signs in the earth; creation groaning ·         Return of diseases previously eradicated and the worrisome world Ebola threat ·         The world is like it was in the days of Noah, corrupt and filled with wickedness. ·         Horrible terrorist acts are causing fear in the hearts of people worldwide. They're even beheading people here in the U.S.   When we combine current events with the fact that ISIS controls 1/3 of Syria, and many terrorist organizations have a base in its city of Damascus, it appears evident that we will soon see the fulfillment of Isaiah 17.  (Thanks C.N. for this listing!)  We're going to see all prophecy be fulfilled soon! People! Wake up! You can watch real-world news and see these prophecies coming to a head! The writing is on the wall. The Bible isn't a bunch of fairy stories. Archeology,  geology, and even topography confirm these people, places, and events existed and happened! The Wall of Jericho fell outward despite being such a fortified city. The Book of Acts has over 80+ historically verified facts. Acts was written by Luke, who is considered as one of the most credible historians who ever lived. And the fact that Christ's words are coming true means He's God! Only God knows and can prophecy the future thousands of years in advance.  Given that prophecy is coming true 100%, did you know the Bible also states that Jesus will soon reign over the earth for 1000 years? We can rest assured that the earth is going to stick around. The dangerous weather we're all seeing is actually called birth pangs, not climate change. Turbulent, violent weather is a major prophetic indicator. The earth itself is screaming at us that Christ is about to return! That's why creation is in such an uproar.  I'm telling you the truth: Krishna won't save you. allah's just an amalgamation of all of islam's different gods rolled into one. And being a good person won't save you (we've all sinned in some capacity in our lives- how many people have you cussed at and belittled by trolling online this week?).   But guess what? God LOVES you! Goodness does He love you. It goes beyond anything you could understand. And He knows every jot of information there is to know about you, the good and the bad. And guess what else? He loves you... even though you shop-lifted that one time. He loves you even though you get a sick thrill out of trolling people or watching japanese hentai. He loves you even though you're struggling with heroin. And He doesn't want you to suffer under the idea that you did something that you assume is unforgivable. He loves you even though you've slandered and hurt others. And He'll forgive anything. For instance, people have burned His Word. Yet, He's forgiven them! And He wants to forgive you and help you get out of your sinful lifestyle! It doesn't matter if you're black, white, asian, or indian. Ethnicity isn't a barrier to Him. You're His child! We're ALL His children! And if you'll believe in Him, accept Him as your Lord and Savior and repent of your sins, He'll save you! Simple as that. No works or merit-earning required.  Do yourself the biggest favor of your life and take that offer. Why settle for mud pies here on earth when Jesus offers you an eternal feast?  Don't be left behind to endure the Tribulation. Save yourselves now while the Ark doors are still open... because they're about to close. And you do not want to be left here when they finally do close. The judgement of God is a terrifying thing and if you think God is unfair for judging sinners, need I remind you that He's given humanity the opportunity to escape His coming judgement for over 2000 years if they would simply believe in Jesus and repent.  We're talking about the fate of your eternal future here... and eternity is an awful long time to be on the wrong side. Don't let satan drag you down into the lake of fire with him. That's his end game. He doesn't care about you. His attitude is, ""If I'm going down, you're going down with me!"" He wants to destroy you and as many people as possible. What else can explain the evil you see increasing everywhere on a daily basis? Satan knows his time is short and he wants to cause as much damage and ensnare as many souls as possible- yours included. Don't let that monster win your soul!  If you doubt all this, that's fair. You're allowed to doubt all of this if you want to. But the writing is on the wall every day in the news. It's getting harder and harder to deny if you'll wake up and be honest with yourself.  If you have doubts but deep down you want to be saved, I encourage you to seek out the following authors. Ravi Zacharias is great if you have questions about Jesus but you're sensitive to issues of race and foreign ethnicity.  William Lane Craig and Norman L. Geisler are great if you're an atheist or agnostic who believes that science is the end-all, be-all answer to everything. They'll give you answers and evidence to really chew on if you'll be open and honest to what they have to say (basically, they're great if you've ever demanded hard scientific evidence for God's existence). And Lee Strobel is great for those of you who have a cursory interest into whether everything about Jesus and the Bible is true or not.  For more readily available answers, the ""One Minute Apologist"" here on youtube is great for quick answers to tough questions about God.   If you're still in doubt about all of this though, take this to heart: the Bible says Damascus (that's in Syria) will be DESTROYED. A ruinous heap. Test God's word against Him! Read Isaiah 17. If Damascus never falls, then the Bible is false. But when Damascus does soon fall... then you'll know God and His Word is no lie.  Besides that, how can an all-knowing, all-seeing, inerrant God get anything wrong anyway? If He says Jesus is the only way to heaven, then Jesus really is the only way. If there were any other way to heaven, even ONE alternate way, then why did Christ have to die? If there's no hell to protect us all from then His death was pointless. That's why we spread the Gospel: to tell you that there's a way to save yourself. And it's completely free if you'll simply accept Christ's offer! In any other faith you have to work to secure your salvation. The Bible says our works are as dirty rags. None of us could ever produce enough righteous acts to earn our way to heaven. That's why Christ's offer is so great: all you have to do is accept it and He'll cover you with His righteousness!

The sliding land boundary separates the state into the Pacific plate and the North American Plate. According to Geology.com, the fault line runs thorough many populated areas of California and accounts for many of its earthquakes. The plates shift only a couple inches a year, roughly the rate at which human fingernails grow. However, these shifting rates are only an average – theoretically there’s nothing stopping a catastrophic shift in the fault line. While it’s likely that the film plays a little fast and loose with the science behind the San Andreas Fault line, it’s at least sound in concept.",16,28,Cholo W,Bz9e0PGSDeU,0.024278846153846158,2014-12-11 04:14:39,True,True

2015-04-11T08:03:23,"http://screenrant.com/san-andreas-trailer-dwayne-johnson/  The new trailer for San Andreas tries to add a little more gravity to the situation with the foreboding question of “Where will you be?” (actually that’s #WhereWillYouBe), a repeated excerpt of a moody cover song and a dark prediction from Paul Giamatti’s character, but it’s clear that a lot of this movie’s appeal is going to be in its money shots of entire cities rippling, dams bursting, and Johnson flying helicopters past collapsing buildings.  San Andreas is, of course, named after the San Andreas Fault, a meeting of two tectonic plates that extends for over 800 miles through California, and which has already caused a great number of earthquakes since records began. The current research suggests that a major earthquake (over 7.0 on the Richter scale and referred to in predictions as “The Big One”) could occur at any time; and if it happens between now and the release of San Andreas, then the movie could become very tasteless, very fast.",0,0,sageni karthik,Bz9e0PGSDeU,0.02609090909090909,2015-04-11 08:03:23,True,True

I like The Rock, but c'mon Hollywood, what is your obsession with mass destruction and scores of people dying horrible deaths in the wake of a disaster. I mean over 8,000 people JUST lost their lives from the Nepal earthquakes..now I know the studio didn't exactly EXPECT that to happen right before the release of this ""movie""..but couldn't they have the decency to delay the movie atleast a few months? I mean even Training Day got pushed because of 9/11 because of it's violence, and that had absolutely nothing to do with terrorists. I mean EVEN SPIDER-MAN removed the trailer they had of the World Trade Center, and took out the scene...Hollywood these days just don't give a shit I guess.  All I know is...even if that earthquake didn't just happen, it DOES NOT make for a good movie, unless you are so stupid that you need to just watch a bunch of loud crazy nonsense happening all at once to be entertained. That's what Michael Bay movies are for.  Yeah...I hope Mad Max: Fury Road stays #1 at the Box Office and keeps this OUT of the #1 spot. This movie and Jurrassic World look awful. Both just loaded to the brim with CGI...and just an excuse to see people get killed like crazy. Atleast the violence in Mad Max: Fury Road will be stylized, exhilerating, breathtaking, and a hyper-active fantasy driven car chase down Fury Road...not HEY lets make a sequel to a franchise that should have STAYED left alone, but we fucked up twice already so why not throw in a 4th movie? or HEY I got an idea...lets watch people die from natural disasters and make you think how hundreds of people are crying over their lost loved ones, as we in America sit with a bucket of popcorn and applaud at how horrific San Andreas' natural disasters can be.

Why doesn't Hollywood spend more time showing what real structural failure looks like, or informing the public about the theory and benefits of Ductile Overcapacity Design and the formation and limited propagation of plastic hinges throughout the load resisting frame or shear wall system (absorbing the seismic energy, but avoiding TOTAL collapse)?  I'm sure that if the first, say, 45 minutes of the film was devoted to an introductory primer on the current theory of structural design for earthquake, touching on how this is implemented in current American design codes, such as ACI-318, followed by 20 questions that all must complete before the film can be shown, everybody would be happy?   Or perhaps not.    Maybe this is why Hollywood directors and writers pull down such huge earnings while engineers like me are doomed to sit at home each night in beer and pizza stained tee-shirts, trolling YouTube and wondering why we've got no friends at all.  This could be why all conversation stops and everybody clears the room when I walk in, saying that they've just remembered that their house is on fire.  :-(   :-(",0,0,Stuart Clark,Bz9e0PGSDeU,0.008682539682539687,2015-05-19 12:23:36,True,True
