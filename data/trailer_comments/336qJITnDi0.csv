Think about it for a minute, a society where you are completely controlled and are told what to do and how to think, talk, and act! Being Divergent isn't impossible but it is rare.. Divergence threatens the system of the factions that control everyone. That is where all the trouble comes in! Not a dumb book or concept at all.. The ideology and exploration of human characteristics of this series as a whole is an interesting thing.. Stop judging!

I never really liked him anyway. Then he felt as if his life were over because tris's was. To me in allegiant, Tobias was really whiney and didn't deserve tris anyway. Plus, he kinda sorta killed Uriah. What am I kidding, he basically killed him because he thought tris was jealousy of Nita. In the end everyone forgave him which aggravated me even more. I was like ""un un, you don't deserve forgiveness"". But most of all, I'm mad at Veronica because she killed off all my favorite characters. And I didn't like how tris died.
