The film started off well. The material was quite interesting. The soundtrack was great. The main actors were likable and efficient. It was a decent film for the most part,  however, it fell apart in the final act.    Nerve was a game of dares. You can either watch or play.  The dares got more dangerous as the game went on.  The final dare was absurd. They wanted you to believe that this all took place in one night. Everyone was a fan of Nerve, and then there was this well organized revolution against it. Again, it all transpires in this one night.  Lots of unanswered questions: Who put the clothes outside the store? Who were the masked people?  This is strictly for the teens.
