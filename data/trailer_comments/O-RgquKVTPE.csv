2015-07-21T21:20:57,"Bare in mind that even though this is all hypothetical to where this is a story if the asteroid/comet never hit earth, that single act could have changed and altered many things. Humans probably would have never existed as well as bananas, ect.  It was because of that supposed meteor/comet (or whatever took out the dinosaurs) that brought mass extinction upon the dinosaurs, as well as other plants and organisms, so that the small mammals would have less predators to worry about, thus could thrive and evolve into humans and other recognizable animals.  Another interesting fact is that modern humanoids and dinosaurs could not coexist for one reason; there was much more oxygen on the earth during the dinosaurs' reign. Humans wouldn't be able to breathe the thick O2 if they lived with dinos back before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event and vice versa -- if Dinos lived with us today they wouldn't have enough oxygen to breathe for that's how they evolved to be so large. Humans evolved with the post extinction oxygen levels and most modern plants. Humans weren't always the omnivorous brutes we see today.  Why Pixar chose the whitest looking humanoid to play the homosapien-esque character is beyond me. Depends on what era it is and where they are geographically. Is this before or after the ice age? Is the story set in the Cretaceous/Paleogene era where the continents are still extremely close to each other? Or is it simply based in Africa? Humans just recently migrated out of Africa hundred thousand years ago, which is why there are different skin tones based on sun exposure. So it'd take a while for this little boys' and his people to have such lighter skin than their ancestors for this take place. At least several or more million years after those dinosaurs comically watched the meteor/comet pass by, humans were evolving, born, migrated to cooler climates and then we get the main story we see for any of this to make sense.

I felt that going with something slightly more realistic like how the land before time would have made the danger and the perils in the adventure even stronger. Every time I see those T. rex onscreen I have a hard time taking them seriously. But other than that looks interesting so far.   It doesn't seem to have any sort of complex story going on. Most of the focus is on the young Dino getting back to his herd befriending the little boy. Admittedly this isn't the first time these sort of stories have been done but I'm curious to know what else is it going to offer.

2015-07-23T01:41:00,"While I did mention this on a different video about this trailer, it bears repeating here as well. And before I say my main point, the film does look gorgeous. The details on each of the dinosaurs, to the water effects, to the rock texture, it's technically beautiful. With that said, it looks like the biggest problem with this movie, is the main Dino itself. I myself am not against the idea of having a kid-like Dinosaur as the protagonist, but there needs to be some form of consistency. It just doesn't feel right having lush, detailed, realistic environments being inhabited by a googly-eyed squash and stretch machine like the main Dino. That's not to say that squash and stretch effects are bad, but it needs to fit in with the rest of the movie. Maybe I could look past it if it was just like a side character that comes in for about 2 scenes, but this is the main character! Not to mention the clashing styles of having realistic skin on this goofy character is very distracting. I'm not saying the film won't be good, because knowing Pixar, it'll have a polished script, excellent visuals, and a lasting effect on kids, but I can't help but point out something so distracting.",0,0,Zane Tipton,O-RgquKVTPE,0.2613690476190476,2015-07-23 01:41:00,True,True

What Ceratopsian is that at 1:04 I mean really I've seen crazy ceratopsians before like Styracosaurus and Diabloceratops but that no!  2.

Man I got mad but I don't hate pixar I JUST HATE THIS MOVIE.

And even though these dinosaurs are supposed to be 65 million years removed from the Mesozoic ones we all know and love, they really don't look the part.

After humans and animals start to return to Earth, Animals start to be the first to evolve from BnL's radiation, into dinosaur-type creatures(hence their cartoony look). The meteor is a second meteor that just so happened to miss Earth, letting the new dinosaur-like creatures and humans live together. However, after the animals evolved too much, and humans begin to become wiped out once more from the dinosaurs, they split off into primitive 'factions' or 'tribes', thus the caveman-ey look. After more time, the humans AND the dinosaurs will evolve from the BnL radiation, into monsters. That is why there are both Hairy and Lizard-like monsters, because of the Humans and Dinosaurs.

First of all, the dinosaurs doesn't fit in with the realistic environment and also, the plot was a knock-off of both The Land Before Time and Yoshi's Island. In this movie Arlo is out on a journey to send Spot back to his family, and that's the same Yoshi does trying the get baby Mario and Luigi back home to their parents. And it rips off The Land Before Time explaining how things were when Dinosaurs ruled over and going on adventures, getting into many circumstances and fighting against it, finding your true potential, it's all the same as like what LittleFoot and his friends go through the same thing. Also, LittleFoot is much more braver than Arlo is. I'm not going on a full tirade but it's obviously The Land Before Time and Yoshi's Island mixed together and the animation isn't the best either.

2016-11-18T02:03:22,"I loved this movie. I'm glad I gave it a chance. At first glance when I saw trailers for it on tv, the conflicting art styles turned me off. But upon finally viewing the movie a number of times, I've come to love the art choice and the movie itself even more. Because it fits the story. Arlo doesn't belong in the wild, he's meant to stand out. Whilst others find it too cartoony I find it brilliant.   The story I felt was simplistic, perhaps derivative and borrowed many elements from other films, but that is sometime I learned to look past, but all films do in some ways, but it worked. It didn't need to be complex. it didn't need to be original. cliche isn't a bad thing. the Story of Arlo overcoming his fears and surviving in the wild, and watching his growth right from the start and righ to the very end, and his bond with spot which was heartwarming and felt organic, and the way it's told visually more than verbally is great.   Also the subtle progression of Spots character from wild lonely ""animal"", back to a human boy, which starts when Arlo and Spot first make that connection due to a common loss and find comfort in each other because they are both alone in the wild, and just watching Spot slowly uncover his humanity and evolving at the end, by finally walking on two feet when he goes off with his new family was fantastic.   I know this movie isn't a masterpiece, but I think the hate it gets is ridiculously unwarranted. Considering the production problems, the movie still turned out to be good, and still had that pixar magic. Could it have been better? yes it could have. But I appreciate it for how it turned out.  And you can't convince me that the movie doesn't feel like pixar or doesn't have that pixar magic, because those moments with arlo and spot are, charming, heartwarming, bittersweet, joyful, heart wrenching, pure pixar magic. That river scene with the sticks was truly powerful, and it was done with almost no dialogue all visually. I get it, if you didn't like the movie, more power to you. But it is FAR from bad which is what some people say and I just can't agree with that.",98,2,ISetYourFaceOnFire,O-RgquKVTPE,0.13999368686868688,2016-11-18 02:03:22,False,False

2018-01-22T00:54:11,🙋 when the good dinosaur came out onto dvd I just how to get it for my little cousin as a birthday present + I also got him home & the Peanuts movie. He totally loves the good dinosaur more than the other two movies I got for him as a birthday present. He really do love this movie and goes nuts over it. He asked me to get him the good dinosaurs action figures for Christmas. But I told him I don't think they have them out. I even try to go with them to see if they would have the action figures out for the good dinosaur but they don't. No big deal. However I got him a good dinosaur t-shirt instead. I definitely got to say this is like a really really really cute little movie and now I'm actually going to have to go out and buy this one Blu-ray disc for myself. Also I was just wondering who sings the song right here. I know it's a female whoever she is she has a fantastic voice. and this is a good song as well.,0,0,shawn eldridge,O-RgquKVTPE,0.2645962732919255,2018-01-22 00:54:11,False,False

2020-02-28T20:39:03,People love the bad before time but hate this Pixar movie I don’t get the world we live in even people say it rips off the land before time sure they’re are similarities but they’re both different the dinosaurs in the land before time don’t do agriculture or have domesticated species which would of helped them survive in the great valley during harder times but here the dinosaurs are practically sentient and have found way of coexistence without carnivorous dinosaurs killing the herbivores and herbivores actually began to eat crops instead of leaves bark or ferns its pretty genius if you ask me another thing  I hated Jurassic world because it had the same plot as the first Jurassic park but way worse I thought it was good when I first saw it but as I rewatched it and watched reviews of the film I realized this wasn’t a Jurassic park fan film like hoopsanddinoman said it was but rather a cash grab sequel that film made Jurassic park III look like a masterpiece heck it’s sequel fallen kingdom was a lot better   The good dinosaur is severely underrated and it’s not deserved heck even some people say this film destroyed Pixar’s reputation as a animation studio and that’s completely undeserved the good dinosaur actually had heart in it sure they added cliched dinosaurs like apatosaurus Tyrannosaurus rex but they added dinosaurs and pterosaurs that are underrated styracosaurus nyactosaurus heck originally they were going to add ankylosaurus triceratops and parasaurolophus into this film but I’m glad they didn’t because they’re too popular dinosaurs if you catch my drift it’s okay but not terrible or bad or mediocre   Plus what did people expect for the dinosaurs to look cartoony they made them cartoony to make them feel human so we could emote with them more heck Disney’s dinosaur in 2000 made them have human like faces so we could emote to them more I’m sorry if you guys thought I was ranting I’m just upset of how many people hate this film made by pixar,1,1,Holly deemer,O-RgquKVTPE,0.11281565656565656,2020-02-28 20:39:03,False,False

I'll always be able to tell it's not real because its so beautiful it's better than real life. In fact the quality is so good that it's better than any camera can get. Modern cameras, doesn't matter if they use film or digital, just can't capture light and colour like that. They're nothing compared to what human eyes can see. This movie is closer to what I can see compared to any movie or photo I've seen.
