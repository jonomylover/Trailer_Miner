It's a flying one... But i don't think it's Mothra. Could be Rodan or a totally new monster. But at this point i say it kind of looks like Rodan. But i hope they don't go all out crazy and try and make new monsters and end up making generic boring monsters. The Godzilla monsters are kind of unique. Also they say 1954.... I wonder, does this mean they are not ignoring the originl 1954 movie? Or are they only using that year as a omage to the original? No matter, nice one. I'm very exited about this movie. And what i like is that even tough the movie is so freaking close. And we have 2 trailers and 1 leaked trailer we still don't really know all that much.

2014-02-25T20:00:06,"I think Godzilla '98's biggest problem wasn't that Godzilla was radically different. In fact, I thought Godzilla's design was better in that film than his usual, bulky, man-in-a-suit appearance. It was a nice change of pace, made the creature more modern and intimidating, yet still kept to the theme of giant nuclear reptiles destroying cities. She was defeated easily compared to the typical Godzilla, but only after she caused heavy destruction and nearly raised another brood of building-sized mutant lizards.  The problem with that film is that it wasn't very serious. Instead of focusing on the impact Godzilla has, we spend a lot of time with annoying characters and their first-world problems. This really wrecks the film's pacing and damages the tension in the action scenes, as it is difficult to care about what happens to the characters. But I'll still contend that Godzilla '98 doesn't deserve all the flak it gets.  This film, so far, seems like it will do a good job at keeping the tone serious, emphasizing that Godzilla is not only powerful, he's outright unbeatable. And nothing about the characters seems to be forced or slapsticky. My only problem thus far is that this trail uses the BWAAAAAH! sound effect. *eye rolls*  I'm really looking forward to it. Hopefully my expectations don't go to high!  ",0,4,Donald Feltz,vIu85WQTPRc,0.050862068965517246,2014-02-25 20:00:06,True,True

I will admit, I was completely tricked into thinking Man of Steel would be good as well, so I might be falling into the another trap. But while that movie's trailers promised a great story and then delivered nothing but explosions and crap, this movie is hinting at exactly what Godzilla once was. A story of terror with the undercurrent of human involvement in both creating it and then attempting to stop it. Bryan Cranston immediately gets my interest up. Throw in Jesse Pinkman and I'll really be fired up lol. But seriously, Cranston adds credibility somewhat, and the trailer does a good job of showing not just how destructive this Godzilla will be, but how unstoppable he might be.

Hence why we see the plane exploding but can't see the muto because it's one of the small ones. Also, the shot in the Official Teaser Trailer where Aaran Taylor Johnson turns around, that I think is linked to the spider-like mother foot stomp. Like just before she attacks. Look properly.

2014-02-25T22:47:30,"Here's my theories right now.  1. What is GodZilla? Well its hard to tell, it's seem nuclear bombs didn't hurt the damn thing. Although it's still possible this creature is Scientific, if it's a creature that lived at the bottom of the ocean it's very possible the pressure would have made if stronger then nuclear bombs. However, this movie is deeply hinting it's a Kauji, which is cool to.  2. Will their be other monsters? Yes, but none from the original. My guess is after the nuclear bomb failed to work the Japanese scientist created a creature (or two if the rumors prove to be correct) to kill it. After they unleashed it the creature went crazy and only added to the problem, but because it's made to kill GodZilla that remains its prime objective. So I expect two monsters fighting towards the end of the movie, I also think the design of the monster will be a mix of past designs from the original movies. Actually rumors say that the creature will have to forms, an eight legged form, and a wing formed. Sound familiar? The name of the creature or creatures has been rumored to be MUTO's, this is all rumors though, their might not even be another monster.

Also when we finally do see his face, Which was awesome don't get me wrong, it just seems to be lacking a certain…grit to it that real world things have. I mean look at the buildings to either side of him, then look at him. You can tell he's not really there, which I know he isn't but I was expecting it  to make me THINK he was.

Couple things to note though: 0:17 not the best place to put a nuclear power plant. 0:32 looks like Godzilla is heading to Vegas, 0:36 nice job making everyone think that Godzilla (or one of the Muto's) attacks New York with the Las Vegas Statue of Liberty, oh Gareth Edwards you cheeky bastard you, that's why I love you. 0:50 ded. 0:59 Oh boy there bringing 1954 into this, make things more interesting. 1:27 so apparently these Muto could actually be aliens, or ancient monsters awakened from a long slumber. Or just mutant monsters created by nuclear radiation like I expected. Plus it's not the best idea to have you eggs attached to a nuclear missile. 1:32 not Rodan, or Mothra people, new monster, wonder if that noise is it's roar. 1:45 seems like the flying Muto is having fun throwing those F-22 Raptors into the sea, also Monsters just love attack San Fransico and destroy national landmarks don't they? 2:01 either that's Godzilla or the another Muto (kinda has the same roar as the one at 1:32). 2:07 that's a nice looking leg/ arm. 2:10 How exactly are they out running that train? Plus Aaron's character would die either way cause if those Nukes are still active on the train they would go off during the crash, and Aaron would probably die from the fall too at 2:11, and it's obvious to tell that he's just running in front of a greenscreen at 2:07 but meh who cares. 2:13 there's the money shot.

Besides the ""glowing, bubbly"" thing @ 1:27 in the trailer, there is another thing that caught my eye: the HUMONGOUS BONES @ 1:42!! This leads to a personal theory: In the trailer, it's said that the nuclear tests near the end of World War II were not just test, but an effort to defeat Godzilla, and it's entirely possible that the original Godzilla from that time era died, leaving only its decaying bones and its (only) offspring is the reason we haven't heard from it since. It could have grown in the time since then, and is only now appearing because its finally matured into a full adult, leading to an even CRAZIER theory that perhaps other ""Nuclear"" accidents and spills, such as Chernobyl and the incident in Japan in recent years were simply cover ups over time by the government to keep us from panicking over the truth that our inevitable end was near!!!

Because some just suck horribly and the only reason people still cling on to them is because it is something from their childhood memories and they can't let it go.  I mean, I can think of a plethora of movies that could use a reboot.  For instance, The Matrix (1999) should be rebooted and I don't see why it can't be. The fucking movie is almost 15 years old now.  Hollywood needs to reinvent the thing with new cast and preferably Nolan/Snyder at the helm.

2014-02-26T06:03:09,Well Legendary did surprisingly well with Pacific Rim for them to be able to do the new Godzilla is probably a dream come true to Guillermo del Toro who was so inspired by Ishiro Honda and Ray Harryhausen. The question is can he pull Godzilla off right. So far appearance-wise it's on the mark and going off the traditional Godzilla storyline its not the Original or its other alternate ones like GMK and Godzilla 2000 but almost reminiscent of Zilla (never calling that iguana the G-man) storyline which gives us a new perspective.

It's not about the monster, it's about trying to get a message across like what Ishiro Honda and Tomoyuki Tanaka tried to convey across with their 1954 masterpiece in regards to the use of nuclear energy, meddle with dangerous technology and eventually you will lose control of it and it will destroy you.

Mechanical failure? EMP? Glancing blow? 0:25 Linear accelerator? Obviously some sort of underground science lab for physics.... 0:29 Same underground lab? Is it military, or is it civilian and the military is coming in? 0:36 Glancing blow by tail would be my guess, otherwise it would have been completely flattened. 0:40 prisoner? That glass partition, and he wants to ""Talk to someone in charge"". 0:44 If it is deep enough to pass under the carrier, it shouldn't be visible from the surface, especially if there is particulate matter and those search lights would create glare. Also, at that size, it should be crushed by it's own weight, especially on land. (Science SNAFU #1 and #2) 0:50 Thank goodness those destroyers were of to the sides of that dorsal spine. And that wave is going to cause problems.... 0:51 They're fucked 1:01 What is that fluid? That is radioactive waste that the USSR dumped, and it has a very nasty gash in it. Carried on land by Godzilla? Radiation doesn't cause mutations like this.... (Science SNAFU #3) 1:08 More than one creature, or just one? Judging from dialogue it can be guessed that they failed, yet we see the remains of one? 1:18 Shockwave is to slow, and sound comes on to early and shouldn't crescendo like that (Science Snafu #4) 1:25 Big gun? EM railgun? 1:28 Human weapon, or Godzilla eggs? Construction BY Godzilla? 1:29 Vessel or base? 1:31 Something big diving followed by the jets. thank you +Sandwichman1337 for pointing that out. I missed that on my first run through. 1:33 Three USMC assault carriers, so the jets are probably F-35Bs, soon to be used by the United States Marine Corps (Ooh-rah) 1:36 HALO jump. Spotters for artillery or do they have a  special weapon? 1:40 Civilian bunkers? 1:44 obviously they can be killed 1:47 Golden Gate. San Francisco. 1:50 The military jets were in flat spins, meaning stalls. I am guessing that they get a very nasty tailwind or glancing blows. EMP or mechanical failure are not likely because they should glide, and I saw an F-35 [probably a B model (I hope to get my hands on one of those) because of the lines on the back of the fuselage at 1:53] pilot punch out. 1:53 Canopy is still closed, so somebody didn't punch out.... Why? Pilot error or mechanical? Or is the pilot incapacitated (High G spins can knock you out)? 2:03 Signal flares. Danger close? 2:11 That Blackhawk has an engine fire and tail rotor failure (judging from direction of spin) 2:18 That classic roar and title....﻿  Teaser: 0:01 HALO jump means close-quarters action, so I expect that they have a weapon. 0:15 A whole platoon? 0:28 C-17 Globemaster III. Smoke flares to prevent collision with other jumpers. Also, for that cargo bay, it should be wider if it is a C-17. 0:47 Electrically charged smoke? I see a fair sized risk of the jumpers getting struck. 1:19 I still think that is a Linear accelerator. Obviously some sort of underground science lab for physics, either military or civilian. 1:20 What is the purpose of the train? Probably not armoured because it won't make a difference, but would probably set it down. And why a cargo train? 1:27 Obviously a military bunker 1:28 HAZMAT suit. Bio, chem, or nuclear weapon? 1:32 Crashing, or simply exploding on the tarmac? 1:34 What the fuck is that? nuclear torpedo? Suicide nuke for the ship to ram with? Some other weapon? 1:38 Underground or on a ship? Again, why HAZMAT? 1:40 Yeah, armor on the train won't help....

On a side note, There are plans to release a SH Monsterarts 2014 godzilla toy that will be released later this year, but with the size of this godzilla (from the looks of it larger than any other godzilla to date) will they remain true to their size scaling and make this one as big or even bigger than their biggest figures as of now(biolante/destroyah) or will they make it similar size to the a godzillas they've released already?",2,0,MrFireStorm14,vIu85WQTPRc,0.2560416666666666,2014-02-27 00:44:13,True,True

According to the Azerbaijani side, as well as Memorial Human Rights Center, Human Rights Watch and other international observers, the massacre was committed by the ethnic Armenian armed forces, reportedly with help of the Russian 366th Motor Rifle Regiment, apparently not acting on orders from the command. 613 civilians, including 106 women and 83 children were killed during this tragedy.

Heck they even got the island in which the Manhattan Project (1942 to 1946) occurred. But really now. How is a test situated a whole DECADE BEFORE Godzilla's awakening have to do with the bombing projects?  According to the original movie... ""Before being mutated by the nuclear fallout of atomic bomb tests performed on an island called Rongerik, which is close to Lagos Island, the island where Godzilla lived, Godzilla was a Godzillasaurus that had somehow survived the extinction of the dinosaurs in the late Cretaceous era.""

2014-02-27T05:21:34,"All you need to know about the new Godzilla:  - Godzilla's Regenerator ability full-detail description: Godzilla has the ability to restore all of his body using radiation as long as a single cell nucleus remains intact and is able to absorb radiation. The skeleton seen in this trailer is the real Godzilla's bones from a previous body. The egg sac looking thing around the nuclear missile is actually a cluster of Godzilla cells laying dormant.  - Many Toho monsters are alive and real and make  appearances in this film: Zilla Junior (Godzilla: The Series), Clover (Cloverfield, Godzilla: The Series), Orga (Godzilla: 2000) all have been confirmed to make cameo appearances as well as be involved in the sequel.   -There are no jaegers in this film. All cross dimensional beings are considered non-canon.   - The flying monster is in fact Rodan.  -Plot: As the world begins to transitions into the thermo nuclear era, the Military discover Godzilla. They are scared of Godzilla so they try to use nuclear bombs to blow him up. Because of this Godzilla's body dies and he goes into a dormant state. The scientists begin to study Godzilla's cells and create the M.U.T.O.'s project to create a weapon even greater than the nuclear bomb through bio-engineering. They create a giant insect like M.U.T.O. and Rodan. They escape captivity and begin to wreak havoc upon the Earth. Godzilla is awakened but he still remembers how the humans attacked him and goes on a rampage. He eventually meets up with the insect M.U.T.O.S. and kills the insect one. Realizing how strong he is he decides to become earths protector for the glory of it all. An alienship with orga in it impressed with Godzillas skills in battle is revealed to have been watching the entire time. In the post credits scene: Orga releases an army of monsters including one semi sized monster (Clover) into the water near where the insect MUTOS was killed and begins to absorb its body.  Afterwards: Godzilla 1998- Godzilla : The Series occurs and somehow the government has managed to keep this entire truth a secrecy to the public. Then Cloverfield occurs and New York becomes monster island.  Second Movie Plot Speculation Destroy All monsters themed battles with Godzilla,Zilla, Rodan (who has been hiding this entire time), Clover, and Orga.and a Giant squid like muto who is clovers ally. ",0,5,Jon Mcgough,vIu85WQTPRc,0.12659130992464324,2014-02-27 05:21:34,True,True

2014-02-28T00:17:44,"People seemingly are confused about Godzilla. I'll explain it to you:  Godzilla is a force of nature. He represents the fears/terrors of the Nuclear Bomb--Hence the Atomic Age. He was created by such weapon of destruction,or you can say ""awaken"".   The film majority you guys know,""GODZILLA"" that was released back in 1998 was NOT Godzilla. It's even confirmed to be Zilla. This was stated in GMK and Godzilla: Final Wars. Heck Godzilla even fought the creature,and killed it in seconds in the recent film.   Godzilla and ""Zilla"" are completely different Kaiju. Godzilla is literally a mutated Godzillasaurus. While on the other hand,Zilla is simply a mutated Marine Iguana.   As for people saying,""Godzilla can survive nukes""? Yes,obviously. Godzilla is capable of withstanding Black Holes and Falling Meteors at point blank range. He also survived in molten lava nearly 4 years,back in 1985. Godzilla only died TWICE. In the original film back in 1954,Dr. Serizawa created the Oxygen Destroyer,which evaporated the creature into bones. The second death was caused by a Nuclear Meltdown in his heart,which could literally destroyed the Earth itself.  Many people are confused,due to Zilla(1998 Film) being killed by Bullets/Missiles.    Godzilla, and plenty of other Toho creatures is capable of withstanding such weapons. As for Nuking,Godzilla literally absorbs the energy: He usually feeds on such power.

This dead monster could be in fact be the Mothra like monster in its first form before turning into a flying monster. As for the Rodan monster.

2014-03-01T15:18:57,SUCKERS!! Just another movie where the trailers looks awesome but the actual film  is gonna be CRAP. The giveaway is the clip at @1:38- typical Hollywood sentimentality rubbish - someguy crying like a pussy cuz his wife is going away - always tells movie is gonna be trite. Surprised there was no clip of a daddy saying how much  he loves his little cute 4 years old daughter. Also check this  no A-list actors in this movie - cuz their agents would have known how crap this movie is after geting hold of the script .!! Don't waste your money - the marketing machine is just trying to suck in as many suckers they can in 6 months. Wait for it to come out online to prove what i'm saying is true  ;) ;) ;)   muhahahaha,0,0,killerwaz88,vIu85WQTPRc,0.009320175438596482,2014-03-01 15:18:57,True,True

Thousands of Whites in the U.S have been attacked in a similar fashion.  The attackers call this ""POLAR BEAR HUNTING.""

The media gives similar treatment to this much deadlier attack on Whites: ""Asia for the Asians, Africa for the Africans, White countries for EVERYBODY!""  That's a Knockout Punch for the White race.

I don't know about anyone else but i would really love for this to adopt a more Pacific Rim approach and just show us Godzilla and the other monsters just beating the holy shit out of each-other in the middle of a city. This is being directed by the same guy who did that movie Monsters and anyone who's seen it would know that it was ridiculously centered on the human characters and featured barely any actual monster scenes and he said that he shot Godzilla very similarly to that. Please Godzilla don't be a fuck up I've been waiting for this movie for so long and I'm so worried that its gonna hide the action and try and be some human centered movie that tries to have a serious undertone to it, just give us what we want - Godzilla absolutely destroying city's and other monsters in clear scenes that don't try and hide the action to make us guess whats going on and for once in a giant monster movie just give us a clear fucking look at the monsters its one of the reasons pacific rim was so successful. ",10,12,RyzingTerror,vIu85WQTPRc,0.050231481481481474,2014-03-06 16:53:28,True,True

No theme from Akira Ifukube~to not include the man who gave Godzilla his soul, is completely uncalled for. His theme is ""The Theme"" of Godzilla. Edwards says it will be in the ""tone of Akira""  That just isn't good enough. The tone can be the new composer, but, the theme must be there.  It seems like he is going to have Godzilla killed, and there are rumors there might even be a second Godzilla, which I hope isn't true. I don't want to see the older Godzilla dying while the younger watch or vice versa. That might be the ""secret"" that these people are talking about regarding a plot line that improves the movie.  I have no complaints about the design. Its fantastic, the feet are a bit off, but nothing really that bothers me that much.  I have no complaints on the trailer or the teaser.

Godzilla is AGAINST nukes, not WITH them.  2. This movie is gonna kick that 1998 piece of shit out of existence once and for all.

Here is the problem; i remember Godzilla from 1998 and what we saw in trailers for that was a foot; then when we go see the movie expecting ゴジラ[Gojira](GodZilla) we get the less impressive Zilla which because of that film is now cannon in the Godzilla universe though i can't say he's considered much of a threat compared to Godzilla itself .  This just looks like trailer baiting to me but it's hard to really say if the movie will be good or if we'll have a repeat performance. It doesn't help when the asian trailer has a line that has someone describing (I assume) godzilla as a god; which wouldn't make sense since because his Japanese name can be translated to Gorilla, Whale and from the sounds of it has no meaning to it what so ever other than sounding cool.

2014-05-04T23:17:45,"Still not sure how it's going to turn out, though it seems to be better than TriStar Zilla at any rate. But until we actually see some extended scenes both of Godzilla and of the acting it's hard to judge since you can make ANYTHING look good if you splice it up enough into a short trailer. Still looking interesting so far.  One minor thing bugs me though, not a super big deal but I noticed it. The comment about the nuclear tests in the pacific being an attempt to try and kill Godzilla. That's like...the opposite end of where this all started. The original Godzilla was a symbol for the Japanese fear of nuclear weapons after WWII (ever watch the original? Ever notice that what he does and the peoples reaction to it is incredibly similar to the real life reactions to the nuclear bomb?). Again it's a minor thing and will be unlikely to make a difference in its quality, but seeing as Godzilla was always supposed to be an anti-nuclear statement it's odd that they choose nukes to fight him. ",1,1,Goldenkitten1,vIu85WQTPRc,0.05795454545454544,2014-05-04 23:17:45,True,True

It is no secret that Hollywood is going in a nostalgic geek trend (while producing rather polarizing opinions) they are trying to dig up and look back at some of their great franchises. However, in all fairness I do not need to talk about that because this was inevitable even if we weren’t doing all these remakes and reboots because this franchise could not possibly die…. This title is so important that it would have happened eventually and to be honest I am genuinely shocked it didn’t happen sooner. It was in 2004 when the last movie made… 2004… 10 full years. I remember all throughout those 10 years of my youth thinking, asking, wondering, “Where is it”?Decades upon decades of being household name and then all of a sudden someone decides that it just stop existing?! Impossible! This was going to happen someday no matter what! But in those 10 years of waiting I had grown older, wiser, more understanding of the world and people and all my preferred fields of entertainment and in that time I had grown… Comfortable. My interests had shifted quite a bit and while I always thought and hoped I eventually stopped thinking about it. It was no longer a big priority and when I think about it I don't recall it had been one to begin with.... My point is that I moved on; in those 10 years this little franchise and the genre it inspired had fallen greatly on the scale of my many, many beloved genres and who can blame me? In those 10 years this genre got such little attention from the industry so I couldn’t help but give it little attention as well…. I guess in a way when Hollywood moved on from it so did I and I can’t really regret that because in those 10 years I developed such a high appreciation and understanding of fiction and feel all the more wiser and healthy for it…. Having said all that… While I had “moved on” I had never fully “forgotten”. There was always a voice somewhere deep in my subconscious that while far from loud, was never unnoticed. This voice was quiet, patient, and respectful but most of all it was curious. That voice always had one question that question was “when”….? Now… my friends… and relations… After 10 full long years of patiently waiting and patiently wondering… the day. Has. Come. My friends… That voice in my head as finally received its long-awaited reward. This is the year… This is the time… The day has finally come when the beast… the Monster… the GOD…. … THE LEGEND! Finally returns… BIGGER… STRONGER… AND READY!!! TO REMIND THE WORLD JUST WHAT IT WAS! IS! AND ALLLLLLLLLLLLLWAYYYYYSS WILLL BEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! MY FRIENDS IT HAS! RETURNED! TO DESTROY!

The problem is the trailers, the trailers looked SO promising and looked like a family that was completely lost in the big city during this epic fight.. what we get is basically a miltary movie with a little monsters fighting.  I mean, it takes ALL the tention away if the military is saying what they are going to do with the monsters, it would be a lot better if you see a normal family running away and trying to survive.  Major dissapointment.﻿",2,6,Cedric Mathew Hudson,vIu85WQTPRc,0.10861111111111113,2014-05-14 20:35:59,False,True

The company needs to get sued for false advertising I payed for Godzilla not the son of the guy that we thought was the main character. but seriously Godzilla is only in this for like 5 of the 120 minutes. otherwise it's focused on the very generic and forgettable ""Bad guy"" (or guys?). why did they cast Bryan Cranston or give him a wife (That isn't mentioned for the rest of the movie and doesn't affect the plot whatsoever) just to kill him off. also why even call it Godzilla? sorry I guess i'm just pissed off cause I fucking paid for this piece of shit that I waited years for! the ending is probably the worst part it is in no way satisfying and it gives you no closure that an ending should have. the movie has little to no story especially after Bryan Cranston dies, after that things just happen with no story (Also a funny thing I noticed is that kids have the magical ability to find there parents in seconds despite being in a crowded area where everyone is screaming and looking for there Children/Parents) and the fact that Godzilla didn't die at the end when it was totally built up for it sucked! (not that I wanted him dead but they totally made look like he had died) and then the credits just abruptly pop up without answering questions and totally building up for a sequel. however the fight at the end with Godzilla and the two things was pretty sweet (especially how he killed the second one) all in all i'd give it a 5/10 and that's being generous I am genuinely upset that it got a 8/10 almost everywhere.",0,0,maxyooyu,vIu85WQTPRc,-0.09552469135802472,2014-05-15 23:09:38,False,True

So many parts where I'm just breathless and had chills from sheer awesomeness (I'm not exaggerating). The part that got me was Godzilla's first roar, it was just EPIC. This whole movie is epic. Not to mention it stays pretty true to the japanese Gojira too (unlike the other Godzilla film) There is another big EPIC part of the movie for me, but I'd rather not spoil anything for you guys. I didn't expect it in the movie, so it caught me offguard and I was like ""OOOHHHHHHHH"" (which I'm pretty sure the whole theater had the same reaction). This movie is imo the best monster movie that I've seen that isn't Japanese (no offense, but you can't beat Japanese Gojira movies.). If you watched and liked Pacific Rim, then you will love this.

2014-05-16T11:27:51,"Ok I just watched the movie, and I know that nobody cares, but I'll just go ahead and say it anyway, because I need to get this off my chest. I'd like to say that I am not a movie critic, and I don't pretend to be, but this is just my opinion. I'll try not to put any spoilers.  I really wanted to like this movie...I really did, but it was just so... boring. Godzilla himself was only in the movie for like 10 minutes, I swear, time that shit if you don't believe me, the rest of the time the movie is just filled with people talking, so don't bother going to watch it in IMAX. It also didn't help that the whole story just felt so disjointed, halfway through the movie I just phased out and started looking around the movie theatre due to boredom. You don't feel for ANY of the characters (except maybe Joe Brody), and it was so frustrating how they cut away every time there was about to be a fight. Now I know that people say ""Oh thats how it was in the original Godzilla movie, Gareth Edwards is just paying homage to that blah blah blah"", but you're forgetting, this isn't the 1950s anymore, audiences have different expectations nowadays. Maybe old school godzilla fans will love this one, but I can say with some certainty that it won't win any new fans. To be honest I enjoyed the older Godzilla movies much much better (Godzilla vs Mothra, Godzilla: Final Wars etc). They may have been cheesy, but at least they had a much higher fun factor than this movie. The last time I was this disappointed in a movie was Man of Steel.

2014-05-17T03:46:30,"5 Reason why I don't like Godzilla 2014 movie: 1. Godzilla is too slow, lazy, and weak. Why not just cut to the chase just have Godzilla at the city already instead of having military following it the rest of the movie. When Godzilla defeat male and female MUTO it went to sleep at night in destroyed city and then wake up in the morning. WTF! Seriously? Godzilla would never sleep in the city. Godzilla would just walk to the ocean and swim return to monster island (home) and then roar during sunset. 2. Godzilla atomic breath was too thin and short. I prefer the old classic big bang wide blue atomic breath. In the film, the atomic blue breath was weak. 3. Too much military action and less monster fight. Example: Godzilla was about to fight Male MUTO at Honolulu airport next thing you know you see them in the news. 4. Godzilla got his ass kicked more than it defeat male and female MUTO by tail whipped and atomic breath. MUTO is nothing compared to King Ghidorah, Gigan, Megalon, Orga, Destroyah, Spacegodzilla, Mechagodzilla 1/2/3, and Monster X Kaizer. 5. Too much Human motion less monster scene. What is this soap opera? This is Godzilla film not some dumb militarism movie. I watch many of Godzilla film I find show mostly about Godzilla fighting against monster and alien creatures than human motion.  PS: The only Godzilla version I like is Millennium Era Godzilla from the movie Godzilla 2000 to Godzilla Tokyo SOS.

Well, in my opinion they used him just about right. The teasing of the fight and then cutting it away was a smart strategy on the movie's part, it made everyone pumped for the final battle in the end. I mean, the reason it seemed like Godzilla was showed multiple times in the past was because the old movies were like half an hour to 1 hour long where in reality, the human characters were showed a lot more than he did. This is why people love the T-rex from JP, they didn't show it every five minutes, and when it did finally show up, people went nuts. This movie was 2 hours long, so if they showed him too much, people would have gotten sick of him, just like how people got sick of the Spinosaurus in JP3. They showed the MUTO's or whatever those things are, more times so that when the Big G finally shows up, people are pumped as hell for the fight.

They find the power plant being rebuilt and reused by Japanese scientists. A huge flying insect that has the power to send electromagnetic pulses is at the plant, and it is set free. It continues on its way to eat nuclear radiation (that is what it feeds on). It goes on a rampage trying to kill everyone and find its mate to reproduce.

It was great and one of the best movies i have seen. Much much better than pacific rim! Even tho godzilla wasnt that much in the movie there were much muto scenes which kept the tension alive.

I mean, what a coincidence that his son (Main Character) of all the possibilities in life, would turn out to be the military bomb-expert who would save ""Gojira"" from the MUTOs.   Also, they keep saying that ""Gojira"" came to feed on the MUTOs, but it just fights them and it doesn't even consume them, leaving their corpses behind. And then it acts like it has a ""consciousness"". Isn't ""Gojira"" supposed to be an animal?  And that radioactive blue flame? How come it didn't kill anybody around it because of it's highly radioactive values?  TL;DR - Movie was nice, but it has too many Hollywood clichés.

The sound design, cinematography are fantastic - like seeing giant mural's of gargantuan forces on screen.

It was about the military tracking down some other monster that was barely even dangerous to begin with.  Wasn't worth waiting through almost 2 hours of your run of the mil military film just to see a couple minutes of Godzilla. Fuck,you've no idea how disappointed I was. I came into the film expecting Godzilla to be about goddamn Godzilla. Maybe if they get the green light for a second film I should go in expecting a military film and nothing Godzilla related,maybe I won't be so let down then.

They nailed Godzilla perfectly, unlike that trash that was released in '98 (AKA the epitome of GARBAGE). If you knew anything about the original film, you'd know that Godzilla had very little screen time to add suspense/buildup to make his appearance more dramatic (kinda like other monster movies like JAWS and Aliens). This film payed homage to classics doing so. As for the acting not being that good according to people, LMAO when has a Godzilla movie ever had great acting?

2014-05-18T01:35:50,"Disappointed. Godzilla has less than five minutes of actual screen time (not counting close-up shots of his skin or Spines protruding out of the water), whilst the MUTOs shared a good 25% of the film.  [SPOILERS in review] It takes an hour and a half for Godzilla to actual start fighting and then they don't even show you the fight scene! They cut to black and the next thing you see of it is a destroyed city. Another fifteen minutes later we see the two MUTO converge on Godzilla and he barely even moves. He just keeps getting knocked into buildings trying to defend him self. There are two fight scenes between the two Kaiju, none of them last more than 2 minutes. Most of the film is pointless explosions - whether it be artillery, weapons, buildings or vehicles crashing. They tried to characterise the human's through lengthy conversations but they never put characterization on Godzilla himself. I was hoping it would be more like the 2005 King Kong where we got lengthy, intense (and most importantly memorable) fights and deep characterisation of Kong, often both at the same time but instead Godzilla was used more as a tool or plot point than a character which makes it hard for the film to be memorable in any way.  The only memorable events are Godzilla's roar at the end because it lasts so long (which is good, it's the only part in the film that gives a sense of awe). The chilling scene where his spines light up before he releases his atomic breath. And when the MUTO tap the ground and release EMPs (although this is only memorable because it happens every 20 minutes).",0,0,Zac Walton.,vIu85WQTPRc,0.12752525252525254,2014-05-18 01:35:50,False,True
2014-05-18T01:40:33,"Godzilla (2014) 1/10 So there are several problems for me with this movie  1. The setup: If Nuclear Powerplants would work like that we'd all be dead by now. 2. Yes, humans can outrun superheated steam. 3. Safety zones? We need no stinking safety zones. (yes, still at the setup). 4. So your monsters like nuclear radiation? Cool. So why did they not eat that really juice nuclear aircraft carrier but instead chose to chomp down on a Russian nuclear sub? 5. Tsunamis don't work that way. 6. And while we're at it: No shop window / door is going to hold THAT amount of water back. 7. I know the US military must be completely incompetent, but you'd figure they could use a few MOABS or at least stop using peashooters to try and take on the monsters. And yes, a .50 cal qualifies as a pea shooter if you have a giant monster. 8. Really? You think it's a good idea to hold people on a bridge that crosses the narrow spot the monsters will go through? And for added ""bonus"" you put some tanks on that bridge? 9.

The old ones,  almost the whole thing is scientists talking about the monsters or some human subplot we don't really care for and most of the mid movie monster shots are just them swimming or walking towards the battleground for the end of the movie.  I think I'm gonna like it because it sounds like they tried to make a real Godzilla movie that long time fans will appreciate rather than Hollywood it up and pander to the brain dead masses like the 1998 version did.  Commendable they didn't go that route since all that matters now a days is opening weekend sales and with a big name like Godzilla they could have done anything and made the money they wanted  with no regard for killing the franchise,,,,again.",0,0,Jargas101,vIu85WQTPRc,0.08712121212121213,2014-05-18 02:39:16,False,True

Most of the fight scenes happen in the dark and it's hard to make out what's happening. If they had a fight during the daytime that continued into the night that would have been fine. Also the plot about the soldier was boring. The military should only be there to get their asses handed to them by Godzilla. Also I would like to add that Godzilla is barely in this movie. Most of the time the movie has to remind you that this is a godzilla movie. I understand they have to add suspense but too much suspense can kill a movie. Luckily I don't think the movie was killed but it did suffer from it.

2014-05-18T07:27:21,"""The arrogance of man is thinking Nature is in our control, and not the other way around.""  2014's Godzilla brings the King of the Monsters back to his dark and gritty roots. The 1954 film portrayed him as a destructive force of nature. He symbolized the devastation of the atomic bomb on Japan and its citizens. Here, Gareth Edwards depicts him differently. He's still destructive, but he's not the main threat; rather, he's an anti-hero fighting off the newly introduced MUTO monsters. This film's overall theme has to do more with how humanity has destroyed nature and thinks they're able to control and manipulate it. The MUTO are basically nature taking its revenge on mankind, and Godzilla is the force meant to restore balance (no Star Wars joke intended). Now, how well did they execute what they were trying to portray? Very. It starts slow, but it does a great job of building suspense and developing the human characters. I was highly engrossed in the film and exploring the characters, and I honestly shed a few tears during some of the more emotional moments in the film. They were that engaging to me. It all ends with the final showdown between Godzilla and the MUTO, with the humans trying to rectify the mistakes they made when trying to kill them off themselves. And boy, does the climax deliver in a big way. The visual effects were amazing and the cinematography was very well done. It was an incredibly satisfying way to end it. Overall, I loved the film and felt that it stayed true to the atmosphere of the 1954 original while still diverging from the formula and updating it to be more relevant to modern times (and quite successfully). There are a few flaws, like some obvious plot conveniences, but I was able to overlook them easily, so they're nothing more than nitpicks. This is also not a film to be viewed superficially. Many philosophical ideologies are brought up throughout the film to support the underlying theme, which is why Ken Watanabe's quote from the trailer that I used to begin my review is so significant. You must fully analyze this film to truly understand the message it is trying to get across. That is why I consider this film a near masterpiece.  tl;dr very deep and engaging if you come in with the right mindset 9.5/10",1,0,Night Owl,vIu85WQTPRc,0.19702245670995674,2014-05-18 07:27:21,False,True

Its a reboot for crying out loud you cant expect him to appear in every single part like the old godzilla series. And the plot of the film (admit it) is better than the old godzilla movies(excluding the first godzilla film). And I cant believe that there was someone who said that the 1998 godzilla film was 10 times better. Wtf!!! That film basically ruined Godzilla! In fact the monster was renamed to zilla. There's also complaining about godzilla's redesign.  Many people say its bad because it doesent look like the original godzilla.Well ofcourse they had to redesign him. They cant keep using the old godzilla look. In fact this one looks awesome for me it looks more terrifying and more serious than the old one.

It sounds to me the right approach for a Godzilla reboot for building tension  and so far has been a huge success and will be a new era Godzilla franchise so why go mad and out do yourself in the first new outing while there's room for bigger, jaw dropping badassery to experience in future sequels with plenty of screen time for G...

The whole concept of the monsters arriving and wrecking havoc could have been idiotic, but the way that Godzilla and the M.U.T.O.S. are depicted and explained is very sensible. There actually isn't a bad guy here as the monsters are treated as animals, and, I for one, love that approach.  The M.U.T.O.S are very cool looking and original, and so is Godzilla. The CGI is amazing! This is probably one of the best looking blockbuster films that I have seen. My jaw of on the floor during the third act of the film, while has a huge pay off from the film's earlier teasing. Garth Edwards does an amazing job in the director's seat.  The characters and the dialogue are fine. Each actor does a remarkable job in their individual roles. They were believable, and the human aspect of the story never dragged for me.  Overall, Godzilla was very engaging, smart, and epic. This movie is not going to be a waste of your money.

I really enjoyed the original as well, again, where he only really appears in the final half an hour or so.   That having been said, the movies where he is featured more prominently do work well for me, if the other monsters are featured long enough to, just to keep things interesting, i.e. godzilla vs mothra (1964), and godzilla vs destroyah.   Films like, godzilla vs biollante, and return of godzilla don't really work for me because he is on screen too much, and honestly, i get a bit bored!   i appreciate suspense films like cloverfield, jaws, and jurassic park, but that's just me.   so i'm interested in your opinions guys; are the critics over reacting about his screen time? Or does it really take away from the enjoyability of it, because for me i perception atm is that i will really enjoy it, but the reviews are making me sceptical.

2014-05-18T18:12:17,"You know what? F*ck it:  This movie was badass. I don't care about what the critics say. I don't care what the nitpickers say. Yes, they hold off on the final battle, but to be fair, EVERY GODZILLA MOVIE DOES THIS. The final battle is always during the third act at the very end of the movie. Heck, even in the original, Godzilla only was in 17-20 minutes of screentime. The rest was all people. What's important is if the suspense pays off in the end, and by GOD does it pay off in this film. The ending battle here was the best monster clash I've ever seen, easily topping any Pacific Rim fight.  And what's wrong with the M.U.T.O.s? It's like you people don't even acknowledge they were there! Even though Godzilla wasn't in the first and second acts much, the M.U.T.O.s sure were! You got a ton of monster action throughout the entire film!  Also, the acting in this film wasn't THAT bad. I mean, jeez, you people are RELENTLESS. Sure, it wasn't Oscar-winning or anything, but it sure the f*ck was decent. Plus, it's hard to beat actors like Bryan Cranston and Juilette Binoche, who did such a fantastic job and set the bar really high for the rest of the cast early on.  Finally, you have to take into consideration that this is Gareth Edward's first big-production film. HIS FIRST HOLLYWOOD-FUNDED FILM. He took a monster that everyone previously looked at as silly, unrealistic, and cheesy and flipped the tide. Now people are wanting to see more of the big guy, more destruction, more monster action, more atomic breath (whether they say so through critique or not). I'd say that's DAMN impressive for a first!  I say bring on the sequels, Legendary. The movie had its flaws, but it would be tragic to see a series like Micheal Bay's Transformers get countless sequels and not see this film even get one. My recommendation?

2014-05-18T20:33:52,"     I mean, i'm a huge Godzilla fan. I've been a fan since i was like 3 or 4. But, i just didn't really like this new Godzilla too much. Don't get me wrong, its a fucking awesome movie and it sure was a HUGE improvement from the 1998 one. I know the reason why they held off seeing Godzilla REALLY fight to build suspense and all but i felt like they were just like teasing us with showing a few seconds and then cutting away, that happened a few times. And when they did fight it was like only a 30 minute part out of like a 2 hour movie. I really like how the japanese versions were where there was little camera time focusing on the humans and more action with Godzilla and the monsters. Thats what you expect with a Godzilla movie rather than an hour and thirty minutes focusing on the humans and their point of views. Then they leave little to no time to actually show Godzilla fighting the MUTO. Also they focused way to much on keeping things more realistic where in the other movies they would have portals to other dimensions and aliens from other planets and shit. I mean thats what you expect from a Godzilla/monster movie. We came here and paid good money to see Godzilla fight awesome deadly monsters for most of the movie, still with plot and some human parts. Instead we got point of views and experiences from people almost the whole entire fucking movie and little screen time to the actual reason to we cam to see the movie, to see Godzilla. To me, the plot is good, an awesome monster blockbuster like Jurassic Park or Jaws, and did kinda build up to the climax of the movie, just not what i expect from a Godzilla movie. ",0,0,RtasVadum24,vIu85WQTPRc,0.11562269031781226,2014-05-18 20:33:52,False,True

2014-05-18T22:23:46,"I just watched it today, the movie was phenomenal. There was so much suspense, and this sense of foreboding, and a feeling these monsters were really there. I loved the way the movie started out, the intro added up to the historical appeal of Godzilla, and the enigmatic story behind it all. I loved Bryan Cranston's acting, it was amazing the way he executed every scene, his emotions, his expressions, they were genuine and you could almost feel what he was feeling. Something I really didn't expect in the movie is that the battles didn't take place in a variety of places. I thought the monsters were going to roam around America destroying cities and towns, but their appearances only took place on a few cities, and places. I also didn't like the new profile they gave Godzilla, of almost this ""Here he comes to the rescue"", something cliché like that, from a Superman movie or something, ""Here comes the world's new super soldier... An ancient giant lizard"", that wasn't too bad, is just that it didn't give Godzilla the neutrality and indifference it has towards humanity, it made Godzilla look like the good guy, and he's nowhere near that. I also didn't like the multiple doses of human sentiment, and the fact that Aaron Johnson was another one of those ""pretty-faced"" protagonists, Hollywood has to quit this obsession with the looks, these pretty faces kinda distract you from whatever else is going on in the film. Even though the movie had its flaws, just like every movie of course, I think the movie was amazing overall. I loved the new monsters, I loved the acting, it wasn't that bad considering it was mainstream film, I think it was better than most I believe. The battle scenes were amazing, I don't have many words to describe because the battles were just intense. I loved the film, and I would love to watch it again.

The thing that really struck me about the movie was how it captured the essence of Godzilla's character.  Godzilla is such a great character because he is one of the great monsters of modern media.  A good monster embodies a value in its actions and appearance.  Godzilla is nature's retribution.  As the film states, he is a force of balance. That is what the 1998 version completely missed and what made that film a betrayal of everything the character was. Presenting Godzilla in a new way while remaining true to his character is what the film does best.",1,0,Jess Ammeen,vIu85WQTPRc,0.45802139037433154,2014-05-18 22:38:15,False,True

After Cranston's character was killed off, we had to endure a story dominated by uninteresting subplots for both monster and human (the MUTOs and Ford's family).

The whole point of Big-G is that he is indeed a God, uninterested and uncaring about the lives of the humans he is unwittingly saving in pursuing his personal vendetta against other big scaly gooey things from who knows where, but yet we put some faith in him, wonder if he's ""good"" or ""bad"". He's neither. Lot's of people complained that this movie isn't full of monsters fighting monsters, but I think it portrays the insignificance of humanity against nature perfectly, because we (the human characters in the movie and the audience) are not the centre of attention at all. We can only sit by and watch helplessly as the battle rages, getting glimpses of the creatures and coming to terms with their indifference towards us. They really couldn't care less if we watch them fight or not. They do their thing, swat us aside and disappear again, letting us pick up the pieces and wonder what the point of it all was. Nature doesn't have a point, it just has (in this case) freaking awesome lizard monsters with nuclear breath.

Godzilla turns out to be soft !!  It was awesome when he first went at the female muto and put her in a choke hold and was totally smashing her.  But then the little faggot male muto comes in and I'm like okay shake it off godzilla you got this.  But he gets his ass kicked hard. In fact, the only reason he lived is because of the soldier who destroyed mama muto's nest.  In my opinion we should not have seen godzilla fall that easily.  He should've at leas thrown some punches agains them both  but ideally I would've liked to see him smash both their heads together.  And I got pissed off when he killed the male muto and then got smashed by a building... Only to come back, kill the female muto in one move, and then fall again for no reason.

Sure more Godzilla would have been welcomed but the suspense and the build up in this movie works extraordinarily well! This is what REAL monster movies are, not just mindless violence and monster mash-ups like Pacific Rim!  As for the MUTO'S I really thought I'd hate them, but I LOVED them! They were cleverly thought out foes for Godzilla and I don't want to put spoilers and ruin it for the people who have yet to see it, but some of the MUTO scenes were very frightening (if your looking at it through a ""shit, imagine if this really happened or I was there"" type of perspective, which by the way is the mind frame real monster movies are supposed to put you in)  This was an EPIC movie and when you finally get to see the monsters for the first time (especially Godzilla) it is absolutely mind blowing, and that is a priceless reaction you would NEVER get if you saw Godzilla within the first 20 minutes of the movie!  As for Bryan Cranston's early exit, yes it was sad and he played a fantastic part, but this movie was not made for Bryan Cranston, he simply played a part in a movie like ALL actors do! If you want to watch Bryan Cranston and Bryan Cranston only stick to Breaking Bad!! This is a completely different project which has nothing whatsoever to do with any of Bryan's previous work! Just because he showed an interest and decided to join this project does not mean he has to be in every second of the movie! Actors take different types of roles all the time small and big, its part of being an actor!  Sadly, due to all these flashy super hero/transformers movies people have lost what the true meaning of a cinematic masterpiece is, and if they don't see ""action"" every 20 seconds they get bored! They don't have the patience to actually follow a storyline and connect with the characters :( look at all the groundbreaking box office classics (Jaws, Jurassic Park, King Kong, Creature from the black lagoon to name a few) and the movies have PEOPLE and a STORY and is not based solely on the monster itself trying to"" fuck shit up""!

2014-05-20T03:14:33,Ok i will be the first to admit that Godzilla 2.0 as I would like to call it. Was far better then I was expecting.  It is a worthy tribute to the orgional and not the hack we got the last time. I liked it even better then Pacific Rim as at least this had a plot.   Which however does bring up a concern. Do you guys think there should be a sequel?  I mean where could they possibly go from here? Now while some might want to revisit the past.  I personally don't think that's a good idea.    What made this Godzilla work was that it was something completely new and unexpected.  It also succeed in setting up an interesting story.  One of which if anything should be expanded on.  I don't want Godzilla turning into another Transformers.   Which frankly has lost all direction.  The Island pitch I don't particularly like either as that plays to much like a Jurassic Park.

2014-05-20T22:40:28,"*SPOILERS* I've watched the movie, and in my perspective of things, I've always resented the fact that Brian's character was just tossed aside like a dried up orange before even half of the movie was done with. His 'son' and his story was just really bland and kind of a cliché. I've always hated clichés in movies that have  one character who's most of the time the main character and is like the ONLY person out of every other person to do whatever something big to like save lives of others and what not. Those tend to get really unoriginal fast over the years.  I'll be honest, I'm someone who loves good fight scenes in every movie I see and I was pretty annoyed that they kept cutting out Godzilla's scenes and got to those boring soldiers again each time. The whole plan of blowing up all 3 monsters at once with nukes was NEVER going to work from the beginning. The monsters feed off radiation and kept taking the nukes themselves, bring them on civilian lands and endangering millions. Plus, if they actually killed off Godzilla like that, just how they easily disposed the 1998 Godzilla, I'm sure it would've pissed off a lot of Godzilla fans in the globe. So that whole idea was just half-assed from the beginning.  The movie had some great moments and I've gotten a good laugh from one particular scene in this, so This movie wasn't a total disappointment for me at least. This Americanized Godzilla in my opinion beats that crap from the 1998 version in design and action play. That 1998 ver looked too much like a T-Rex in slanting position despite his size, couldn't even use the trademark Atomic Breath attack, and wasn't durable from human weapons. And now the 2014 version retains all of those traits that make him the genuine king of monsters we all know and love.  Overall, I say this movie wasn't the best of 2014, but it maybe worth watching for anyone who's still interested about see it. I would hope they could perhaps do a Mothra movie in the future.",2,1,Cyber Coldy Mcphearson,vIu85WQTPRc,0.083130081300813,2014-05-20 22:40:28,False,True

The human scenes were really boring, the acting was laughable. The buildup to then revealing the ""Godzilla"" name was too funny to take serious. The main character always ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time for some reason.  I also expected Godzilla to look a little more badass. He looked way too fat, which is weird to say for a creature. The only time he looked menacing was when he was coming out of the water. A lot of scenes did not make sense to me. The part i hated the most was at the end. Everyone surrounds Godzilla thinking that its ok?? No one knew if he was dead or not! No one knew he was on the humans side, for all we knew he was just killing the MUTO because of instinct. Was no one scared at all when he woke up? That to me was the nail in the coffin. I would seriously had rather watched the '98 version all over again, that Godzilla was pretty badass.  The part i did like though was the blue blast in the throat part, that was pretty awesome to see. Also the military scenes are always awesome to watch in these kinds of movies.

2014-05-21T23:41:12,"I just saw Godzilla 2014 in IMAX 3D and I think everyone needs to stop complaining about the very limited screen time Godzilla actually had in the movie. Just like the original, Godzilla didn't get very much time on camera, which adds to the build up, suspense, and the awe when you finally see him. Just imagine the movie with Godzilla popping up and fighting every five minutes, you would lose interest and curiosity and it'll become another mindless monster mash movie. To backup my argument, some movies with it's antagonist on the screen for a small amount of time are: The Wicked Witch - The Wizard of OZ (12 minutes) Darth Vader - Star Wars: A New Hope (12 minutes) Hannibal Lector - Silence of the Lambs (16 minutes) The Joker - The Dark Knight (33 minutes) Which may seem long but is actually only 20% of the movie T-Rex - Jurassic Park (Not sure how much time but it is only a few minutes) Jaws - JAWS (Again not sure but it has to be only a couple minutes) The list goes on for many other lesser known movies. I loved the original, don't get me wrong. But when it comes to the actual production value of the two movies, Godzilla 2014 is much better. Better effects, acting, sound, and in some cases the music which can be opinionated but I think it was great. I would rate Godzilla 1954 9/10 because of the nostalgia and just the fact it is the original and paved the way for the new one. I would rate the 2014 Godzilla 10/10 because it was able to capture what the original had but make it even better. I already know a bunch of people are going to strongly disagree with me but you cannot deny this is the truth. In conclusion, please stop arguing that Godzilla didn't get enough screen time. 10/10 would watch again",23,2,Russel Johnson,vIu85WQTPRc,0.1388389850889851,2014-05-21 23:41:12,False,True

Its a movie of some plot u dont give a crap not just because of the crappy acting which is on purpose replaced by good one, but because nothing in this movie makes sense. Clearly director wanted to emulate what Nolan or Abrams r capable of but with little success Iam afraid. This isnt believable at all especially in the IMAX where u see all those faces well dressed and their makeup applied on each and every face. And when they add bad acting to it like only Elizabeth Olsen is capable of u know this is not going right direction. On the other hand there r good acting moments like Bryan Cranstons parts who r probably best parts of the movie ;) This guy is a magician, he knows how to be believable but even he was probably asking what the fuck Iam doing here? ;) Anyway to finish this some kind of re-view of this radioactive trash, I have to say that apart from Cranstons acting there r very good moments thx to the well made CG! Yes people, only if there would be more good CG and less bad acting. Sorry David Strathairn u r not admiral, not a fucking chance man! Moments like close encounters with monsters look and sound amazing, only if Godzilla would not scream at people in the cinema for almost 5 seconds. Especially good moment is when crew of soldiers jump from the airplane and goes for the freefall showed little bit in the trailer right here 1:34. Music to it and overall feeling to it very good, but what happens next is not. Ridiculous resolution after that is a joke, same like a transport of the nuclear warheads on the train, completely exposed to any attacks. Or amazing plan how to detonate them which doesnt have B and if nobody asking they just go with the one they got... They r going to detonate several megaton nuclear warheads and they just talk about like its some decision u make after long night in the bar.... fuck even that decision would make more sense than this crap.

I felt like I was watching Battle: Los Angles or Pacific Rim or Battleship. Those movies where great but when I watch Godzilla I want to feel like I'm watching Godzilla. Not some scifi movie. The producer obviously did not watch the originals. The movies where about Godzilla not some idiot trying to find out who killed his wife or some kid trying to find his way home. The originals had almost half the show of Godzilla battle something this movie had five minutes of it and those minutes he killed the thing. You explained nothing about the muno or whatever the hell it was. This stupid things were unbelievable. At least I can believe Godzilla was a lizard that got the shit radiated out of him but those cock sucking things were STUPID.

2014-05-26T13:21:29,"I know the point of this kind of movie is action (it did this well), but as someone seeing his first Godzilla movie ever, I thought it was extremely clichéd and formulaic.  It also had a lot of issues...  SPOILERS:  Why the fuck was all the dialogue at the start in the power plant in English? The guy has presumably lived in Japan for some years and is speaking to Japanese people… in Japan. Japanese people rarely speak fluent english. Would he not speak Japanese with his Japanese colleagues? Japanese with subtitles? It's doable guys…  Similarly, when Ford rescues the young Japanese kid, why is he speaking to HIM in English, when he went to a Japanese school and presumably speaks Japanese fluently.   Huge disaster occurs in Japan. Along come the US military: 'we'll take over authority from here.' Wtf? Doesn't Japan have its own government and military with which to respond to this threat/crisis? Why would it just roll over and let superhero America just 'take over'? Classic American movie thinking that 'murica is the centre of the world, a la 'Independence Day' (I still like that movie).  No mention (that I remember) of any kind of international involvement in stopping these giant (alien?) MUTO creatures or huge lizard monster from terrorising the entire world. Wouldn't the leaders of different nations worldwide be in contact? Wouldn't they send their military resources to help? It's cool guys, 'murica will save the day as always.  The scene where the female MUTO breaks out of the nuclear waste bunker thing in Nevada. How the actual fuck did no one notice that before the reveal shot showing the huge hole in the side of the mountain? Did it happen before they went in or during? Wasn't there a… you know… massive fucking crash or something?  Military control room: (I paraphrase) 'civilians still believe it is an earthquake'. Really? Like not one single person had a camera phone or something to leak the news that a giant 20 story high monster has run rampant in Japan? I understand it was meant to be a sealed off area and there were meant to be lots of casualties… but still.  They keep losing track of where the MUTOs are. I'm not an expert on satellites, but wouldn't they all be pointing at them 24/7? Or wouldn't they at least focus on dedicating resources to tracking it, at least from a distance? How do you lose something that huge and destructive in your own country, even for a second?  On a related note, why would you send 2 apocalyptic grade nuclear warheads on a rusty train on a line that you aren't even scouting/securing ahead, knowing full well that it'll attract MUTOs (which you are not keeping track of the movements of). Isn't it somewhat delicate/dangerous cargo? Wouldn't you wanna… like make sure the train line isn't going to be crushed and the warheads somehow detonated in the middle of california? (Hint: people will die)  I'm sure there are more, but the character development and script were dodgy at best. I actually laughed out loud when one of the scientists at the power station monitoring the seismic activity or whatever looks at the reading and goes 'this is worse than we thought'. Also, why does it take bloody Walter White to figure out that it's an electro magnetic pulse being emitted? Seems pretty obvious/detectible. Who are all those guys in lab coats? Extras? Oh wait, that's right.  Killing Walter's (seriously can't remember the guy's character's name, sue me) wife within the first ten minutes of the film is a clumsy attempt at making you emotionally empathetic, when you've had about 2 minutes of screen time to get to know her and you barely know her from a bar of soap. Then Walter himself dies and you're just thinking 'what was that guy even called?'. Conversely, thousands (millions?) of people die right in front of and all around you in the movie and yet you don't really care. Everyone's cheering Godzilla as he swims off into the sunset even though he's presumably responsible for thousands of deaths just with his big stomping feet. It's a bit far fetched to imagine the families of all the dead people actually thinking of him as a good guy, even if he has just effectively saved the planet.   Umm anyone got any more? Basically this movie is shit. ",2,0,allhailthelegs,vIu85WQTPRc,0.06285440613026817,2014-05-26 13:21:29,False,True

Godzilla vs.Military, tanks, planes, cannons etc. To no avail.  Godzilla is indestuctible. We really see the size and majesty of Godzilla, done Hollywood style.  Then, only then, the third act introduces the Mutos.  Godzilla shifts from villian to hero.  Not because he cares about humanity, but because he's protecting his turf.  Maybe it could be established that he was destroying San Fran. because he was impatiently searching out his prey -- the MUTOS.  Alpha predator stuff. Whatever.  Then he defeats them, using his fire breath.  He has satisfied his appetite as predator. Like the actula film, i liked that he sleeps, then wakes up.

In the previews it only showed Cranston as the main actor, but was pleased when I realized the soldier was played by the actor who portrayed John Lennon in ""No where boy"" and Kickass from ""Kickass"". He did a wonderful job carrying the film. Ken Watanabe continues to do good work. I was pumped when I saw the King of Monsters charge his Atomic Fire. So good. So true to the original creation.

Any nay sayers probably don't care for godzilla growing up and not using the same gags we saw in the 70s, like....where it had a kid, and started talking.....This movie focused on Godzilla from a human angle. And in the case of something the size that it is, its fair enough to say that if you were immersed in the same situation in real life you'd pretty much be screwed at getting a full on view of everything thats going on too due to random falling buildings. If godzilla had too much screen time in this movie it would have killed it. He'd go from being a titanic beast to a friendly ghost, hell the Muto's started looking pretty weak and un awe inspiring about half way through due to overexposure. In all, everything from the new higher definition roar to the new skin (still keeping him a little chubby, which is nice) was an epic revisit from an old friend. This generation might want 2 hours of non stop monster fighting but get real, they tried that already with the old movies, and it puts people to sleep because godzilla can only do so many tricks in a fight before its the same shit over and over.

2014-05-31T21:04:53,"Here's what I think the problem with this Godzilla was;  It honestly felt like it was more like another one of those cookie-cutter apocalyptic military dramas than a revolutionary Godzilla film. Godzilla himself was amazing, but he felt more like a guest star in his own movie. Be honest with yourselves, who actually goes to a Godzilla movie for sluggish, over-saturated human/ military drama? This is where I think Edwards made a huge mistake with this movie...this is NOT a remake of the original 1954. I don't know why people are trying to justify the severe lack of screen time Godzilla had because of what the original was like. Godzilla was new back then. The mystery was interesting. This is a reboot 60 years in the future. You have a different audience. The standards are higher. On top of that, there was endless speculation for YEARS when this project was announced, regarding what he was going to look like, how big he was going to be, who, or what he was going to fight..among many other things. You are recreating on of, if not arguably the most iconic movie monster of all time. And it just didn't deliver. I'm not saying it needs monster brawls every 10 minutes like Pacific Rim and such, but when you've got a movie like this that suggests it, you've got to have SOME free-for-all carnage spaced out on the occasion.  I understand he wanted anticipation and suspense, like in Alien, Jaws, and Jurassic Park. But something I felt Edwards forgot about those films, is when it was time for show the monster/ alien/ Godzilla thing, they GAVE you the monster and they actually DID something and had an iconic scene. And if you look most of the time the scenes weren't even that action-driven at all. Look at Jurassic Park; when they built up the suspense for the T-rex, they started by only showing bits of the Rex. Then when it was time to show of the T-rex, they GAVE you the T-rex. Did he start devouring the characters right away? No, we got a terrifying scene where he stalks the kids in the car. And it worked. Same thing with the raptor/ kitchen scene. They didn't just go berserk and start clawing at everything, no they set up a suspensful stalking scene yet still successfully portrayed the character of the creature. But these movies are also supported with powerful characters. Godzilla lacked this entirely. It got frustrating to watch after the first tease. Again, not because he wasn't engaged in a destructive fight scene, but because they kept cutting away from him without actually giving him anything to do. So for those of you who think the ones who desired more screen time on Godzilla's end just wanted endless monster brawls, you're wrong. Well, that's the way I saw it.",0,0,Bret Buckley,vIu85WQTPRc,0.14660173160173165,2014-05-31 21:04:53,False,True

All he did was that he discovered that the male MUTO was talking to something else that's it. Arron Taylor Johnson's character had a bigger role and that's why he was the lead. ATJ's acting was really good for the person he had to play he just had a tough act to follow.

Garth Edwards did a great job teasing him until the end just like in the old films and I like that a lot. The airport scene mad me laugh when they cut it away cause it was clever and smart.

I dislike excessive amounts of CGI in things that do not need it (i.e Hobbit), but anyone complaining about it in a project such as Godzilla is laughable. What do people want them to do, dress someone in a suit? Please no. The CGI in this movie is definitely warranted and VERY well done. This movie was visually stunning, my favorite being the parachute scene which you see in the trailer, coupled with music that was frightening and dramatic in a very good way on the big screen. The monsters didn't look fake or overdone or like they were wrapped in plastic wrap, something many movies suffer from these days. They looked raw and real. Godzilla actually looked like Godzilla. I'm no expert on the original movies, but they seem to have stuck with the original design very well.  Many scenes were often beautiful and eerie. Very good cinematography. As far as music, there were times when there was almost too much music when there shouldn't have been, but when the good scores came, they were masterfully done and placed. Very nice suspense, too. It reminded me much of the far more subtle Monsters, by the same director.  Granted, much of the plot and human stories could have used work and it's not a title that will leave you questioning the workings of human kind. I wish it had revolved around Bryan Cranston's character and his young son instead. That said, it does seem to be delivering the message that we really shouldn't act as if we have control over mother nature, which was nice. I'll add that one thing I really liked a lot is that there was no usage of good vs. evil in the people. There was no sour, vengeful, overdone egotistical jackass ruining everything like you see in so many movies. And the main human protagonist lacked that cocky ""I'm the shit,"" attitude you see a lot of these days. Everyone was, well, HUMAN. They were all scared, confused and while there were disagreements between characters here and there (all natural and understandable arguments, thankfully), there wasn't that one guy acting like it was his way or the highway.

Complete and utter bullshit. I watched this movie twice and the second was better then the first time because I realized that Gareth Edwards was basically setting up a potential sequel and/or trilogy. It's an origin story. Do not expect to see Godzilla that much (even though he was in it for more then enough time). The Mutos were the main focus of the movie. Clear as day. Everyone wanted to see them because the trailers gave hints and quick looks at what they are. But when the movie comes out they get pissed off by the amount of time they had compared to Godzilla. There's no pleasing you people. People complain about how Pacific Rim had absolutely no interesting characters and just being a monster mash-up with a less then stellar plot, but when a movie comes out like Godzilla, who has interesting characters like Bryan Cranston and Ken Wantanabe, people get butthurt with Godzilla not being in the movie and not having monster fights. Gareth Edwards has stated that he didn't want a CGI fest. He did a great job on teasing Godzilla and when he arrived, it was a beautiful sight. He did not over-saturate the movie with monsters. The movie was paying homage to the original Godzilla movies. He did the series a major justice. And best of all, the movie is successful in the box office. We are getting a sequel. He we setting this movie up to be the first in a line of Godzilla movies. We now know what Godzilla is. The sequels will be great movies.  And I'm not saying that Godzilla didn't have flaws. All movies have flaws. The movie for me is a 9/10 because it revived Godzilla and most of all, gave him personality. The movie is an excellent show case on how the Kaiju genre is being revived. Just you people can never be pleased. And to those who are listening and reading these comments saying Godzilla is barely in the movie, the acting is terrible and all of that bullshit, they can not be more wrong. ATJ was a little stale, but he played the stereotypical Navy Lieutenant. The rest of the characters were solid. Please, do not listen to these comments. The movie was not boring at all.

Off-screen they told jokes, had casual conversations with the crew, Andy (Male MUTO) was thrilled to meet Bryan Cranston (he's a big Malcolm in the Middle fan) and Margery (Female MUTO) could barely stay away from Aaron. But seriously, the guy who had the most fun was the Big Man himself. He tried to keep it in, but he just couldn't hide how happy he was to be a part of a big production again. He may be in his sixties, but he acted just like a school boy. I actually got to briefly talk with him for a bit and among our shit-shooting, we talked about his cousin Zilla. Apparently after his big break out movie flopped, he fell into a bit of a depression but is better now. Unfortunately the monsters couldn't make it to the premier (the theatre was too small), but apparently they were happy with how the film turned out, and the Big Man said he's more than game to return for a sequel!

I mean what do you think people want to see when they go see movies about giant monsters, anyway? ""If you want to see monster battles go watch Pacific Rim, or the other Godzilla movies."" What a shitty excuse for an argument. Please don't bullshit yourselves into believing you actually enjoyed the cardboard human drama that overpowered 80% of this movie. You want to watch human drama? That's what CSI, Law & Order and the like are for. I love Godzilla movies, I really do. But I'm sorry, but this was hardly a Godzilla movie. And to be completely honest, I even found the 98 Zilla more entertaining. And that movie is horrible, but ya know what? At least when it was shitty, it was honest, and it kept me somewhat entertained, and didn't cheat me out into believing I was going to see a monster that ended up playing an insignificant role IN HIS OWN MOVIE. Godzilla 2014 was better in the sense of paying homage to the original, but failed miserably to live up to the potential it could've had. Especially with all the speculation that went into it for the what, 3-4 years this project was announced prior to the final release?  And it wasn't even the lack of Godzilla fighting that made this movie frustrating to watch, it was the lack of Godzilla doing anything at all. He could have been interacting with something, or someone. Building anticipation of the beast is one thing, but the constant cock-teasing got stupidly old. The first tease was fine. But after that, he would show up, roar, and get abruptly cut off without him doing anything memorable. Until the last 10 minutes...and even that kept getting cut off.  Call me out on it fanboys, but as shitty as it was 98 Zilla kept me more entertained. Thing is, I wanted to like this 2014 film more, but it just didn't deliver what it advertised. I paid 18 bucks to see Godzilla, not another dime a dozen apocalyptic military/ family drama. There are 200+ channels worth of that stuff on TV already.

For an American reboot this film is beyond compare to its first remake and will impress the fans over the huge build up that will surprise many like what they did 60 years ago. Casting was good, setting was excellent, and CGI performance was outstanding. Another movie to be added to my shelf of films that seems special to me.

OK. its not what you would call a standard, classic Godzilla film, but it does have its perks. it has more people than Godzilla, which i found annoying because for most of the movie, the humans don't do anything. the bomb goes off in the ocean because their original ""this bomb is bigger so it will kill them"" plan didn't work, nearly all of the characters could have been left out, and i had more of an emotional attachment to the MUTOS bomb / mating scene (which was adorable) than i did with the main character and his wife and child. however, the scenes with Godzilla and the MUTOS are freaking awesome. the MUTOS look like a combination of Orga, Rodan, Clover field, and the star ship troopers bugs. Godzilla looked amazing (but his feet looked a little silly) and he was huge. his atomic breath was not as... well... atomic, as it normally blows up anything it hits, and at the end of the scene where Godzilla melts the insides of the female MUTOS (which was awesome), i was expecting a minty fresh breath gum advertisement to pop up at the bottom. i still enjoyed it and it delivered what i expected for an american reboot of Godzilla. (this was a ton better than that 1998 iguana we got.)  Like it or hate it, this movie does prove one simple fact: GODZILLA COULD WHIP CLOVER FIELD'S ASS ANY DAY!!!

Then the Mothra monsters looked like mother and baby that also looked like some kind of metal. I watched more than half of the movie for them to finally show a glimpse of what Godzilla looked like. I couldn`t tell if he was the friend or the enemy. The only and best part of the movie is when he blew fire out his mouth. This movie was a major fail.

Place infantry units on top of high-rises in population centers armed with rifles meant for killing non-giant monster things such as deer.  2. Have combat aircraft fly precariously close to giant monster, helicopter pilots must perform acrobatic twists and turns around target while firing machine gun wildly. Do not use long-range munition that can hit monster at beyond claw-flaying range.  3. Despite knowledge of impending awakening of giant monster in nuclear cold storage, priority of resources must be given to securing local border against illegal immigrants. Do not allocate more than a squad of Special Force personnel, three Humvees, and two light utility/transport helicopters to secure the objective. Do not activate any further air, armour or artillery elements until after a major city has been rampaged through.   4. Have large warships tightly clustered in a strait beside a bridge used for civilian evacuation traffic. Confront giant monster at close range, ignore availability of long range weapons such as acoustic homing torpedoes or Tomahawk missiles. Only fire missiles when monster is 100 yards away, even though said missiles have minimum arming distance of a few miles.  5. All effort and resources must be spent to insure that EOD Lieutenant/""White Messiah"" Brody lives.  6.

2014-08-16T00:49:51,"ENOUGH!! Time for me to show why this movie wasn't good for half of us whose seen it, now brace yourselves for my humongous paragraph of why we don't like the new godzilla movie:  I'm sure people who's never seen Godzilla before could maybe enjoy this movie, but if you're a true godzilla fan or you're just smart, then you could see the problems with this movie as well. Like seriously, we get a movie that has almost no purpose with godzilla being in there at all, and with the show being stolen by the Mutos (the other monsters in this movie) and humans, like seriously the title's called godzilla but the conflict in this movie is ""How we gonna stop them Mutos?"" And no don't mistaken me into complaining that there wasn't that much godzilla in the movie, that's not really the problem here, my problem is that nothing really in this movie actually fulfilled enough to make it feel like a godzilla movie, seriously I thought this movie was a joke. Like 35 minutes through the movie until they actually start talking about godzilla, then he just appears out of nowhere to fight the muto, but still he wasn't really that much of a concern, instead he was just being used in this movie to help beat the Mutos. Also, all that teasing? I'm sure Gareth Edwards, the director, wasn't screwing around with us, but don't any if you feel like he was? Good teasing of godzilla until they finally show his whole body, then they cut him off to humans because oh yeah humans are more important to show in this movie called godzilla, and then we get a stupid 11 seconds fight scene. Then they show godzilla again like another 45 minutes later, but they've already shown godzilla fully but now they still feel like teasing his body parts, very unnecessary, we already saw godzilla, why are they trying to hide him again like it's suppose to be a surprise? Oh yeah, Ford Brody, or Aaron johnson, not very good at acting in this movie, he showed very low emotion to the type of situation going on in this film and he was very, very noncarable. And seriously, HE WAS THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE?? HAHAHAHA he's the main guy here but in the beginning of the movie they built up much more of Bryan Cranstons character to actually make us care more about him. Then he dies so early but that also means his character build up was all for NOTHING, seriously, that means that whole 15 minutes in the beginning of movie was useless and we watched that part for no reason since Cranston wasn't even the main character and he died off almost right after a good character build up. How awesome is that? Then the rest of the movie we get stuck with Aaron Johnson with such boring talking scenes that are also useless, and more boring characters, except Ken Watanabe, and then we get the awesome looking fight scene that we were all waiting for, then nope it cuts back to human conflict. Cuts back to monsters fighting, then cuts back to humans. Cuts back to monsters, then cuts to humans, AGAIN. Then we get the atomic breath, which is super weak and looks like a fire breath, which is not even what he shoots, which means people who aren't familiar with godzilla will now think that godzilla just shoots blue fire, which is very incorrect. I would most likely look at godzillas atomic breath as like a bomb, you know, when it impacts the ground then powerful explosions will happen, just like the godzillas in the 2000s. And um a lot of you also love how the movie ended, I don't. There's not really a reason why, it's just that I didn't feel good about that ending, and that they were wondering if godzilla is their savior. Oh yeah about that godzilla is the savior of the city thing, remember the trailers would always refer to godzilla as like ""It can't be stopped"" or idk just being destructive? Yeah, well idk I just don't see godzilla as a good guy you know, I know he used to be a good guy in past movies, but remaking godzilla in a more serious manner doesn't seem like that's how he's suppose to be portrayed. Well nothing is for sure yet if he is going to be a good guy, but I hope not. So there you have it, why I don't like the new godzilla movie, and holy god King Ghidorah's my favorite godzilla kaiju and seriously he better not be screwed up in the next movie.",10,8,Dragonlord Tevin,vIu85WQTPRc,0.12177028256296552,2014-08-16 00:49:51,False,False

First of all, with the exception of Bryan Cranston (Walter White, bitch!), who's far too good to be in this drivel, all the other actors are either complete unknowns or ones that you would never in your worst nightmare wish to see in a film like this.  Juliette Binoche belongs in boring costume dramas and obscure French indie films. Ken Watanabe is an OK dramatic actor, but here, all he does is look constipated and say things in closeup like: ""We call it...GOJIRA!""  Sally Hawkins is a superb actress, but she doesn't fit the American or Japanese stereotype her role requires. She's absurdly miscast.  Which leaves us with Aaron Taylor-Johnson, the most blank-faced. vapid asshole the silver screen has punished us with since Botox was invented. Not that Aaron has injected Botox into his face. But if he did, he might actually be able to express more than simply mild confusion (hmm...what is 2+2?).  I had hopes (for a while) that things would turn out OK. I mean, Bryan Cranston typically gives his pathetic role his ALL. But fuck you, movie, he doesn't last long. And neither does Juliette Binoche. And suddenly we're supposed to root for Taylor-Johnson as our hero?  HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa hA!!!!  And then we have the horrible special effects. Honestly, I sat there thinking ""What does this remind me of?"". The effects looked unbelievably cheap and unconvincing for such a mega-budget affair, and I've honestly seen better work done by people on their home computers.  My mind drifted back to 2010. One of my most hated films of that year was Monsters. A fucking boring, pretentious piece of shit, in which the director and his girlfriend were running around, hiding from barely seen monsters, when they weren't being in looove.  Now, the effects in Monsters were made by the director himself, on his home computer, so that's why I thought of that film. Gareth Edwards, his name was.  I went to IMDB.

2014-08-27T02:16:00,"Ya know, I loved this movie. I loved how they made him savior/destroyer. However, in my opinion the marketing peeps made a bitch move by having the first trailers show Godzilla as an unstoppable force against mankind. Its as if they wanted to target pop-corn action movie goers when the film itself was structured on ""controlled"" suspense and build up. This was not an all-out action extravaganza and it was not meant to be. This was a Godzilla movie for the fans. The point is, I understand some of the negative criticism on differences from the trailers (except the Asian trailer, which was the most honest). I knew what to expect because I followed it closely and was not let down. There were allot of people who saw the first few trailers and said; ""No more, I'm already sold and I don't want any spoilers"". They had their expectations set and the film did indeed turn out a bit different. I hate it when marketing for anything is handled that way.

Pros: -Face it, amazing CGI -Very good sound design all around, good music, some of the best moments were Godzilla's roars -Build up makes for a good/epic last battle -Bryan Cranston some good scenes with Aaron Taylor Johnson -An over solid plot, Godzilla origin wise/science wise  Cons: -Weak human story at some parts -Lags off at some parts -No truly intense action until 40 minute mark (I checked on that) -I am not complaining here that Bryan Cranston died in the movie, it's really just that he kept the human drama going, and you can see that after him with just Elizabeth Olson and Aaron, it fades away.  And lastly the dialogue was a mixed bag. Maybe it was the dialogue that muddled the human drama, but some moments with the scientists and military and what not had solid dialogue and interesting things to hear. So there you go, a real review instead of infinite praise or down right not giving the movie a chance. I did see it in IMAX, and yes that did make me love it, but I also saw it on DVD, which although still shows the good CGI and what not, doesn't give the experience Godzilla went out to give.

First off, the acting and characters were not that forgettable or bland at all. Aaron Taylor Johnson played a military character trying to get back to his family. Mission first, emotion later. Bryan Cranston was fantastic and his death was justified, he served no further purpose in the plot after that point. Elizabeth Olson's interaction with her son was great. That first scene between Joe Brody, and his wife dying was heart wrenching. I'm not even going to get into the cinematography because it was damn perfect. And in the original 1954 film, Godzilla is in there for a good 20 minutes. The point was to build suspense, create a terrifying atmosphere and make you wait for that great action, which is what this movie pulled off perfectly. Our generation is so accustomed to Michael Bay style storytelling with things blowing up twenty four seven and that just loses the tingle.

2014-09-10T04:30:06,"The reason why Godzilla got less than 20 min. of screen time is: 1. Most of the other Godzilla movies has up to 15-20 min. of Godzilla time, BUT a lot of the other monsters scenes, especially this one, theirs 20+ of MUTO scenes. Also the movies that has more than half of the movie having Godzilla in it, is rather one of the worse (Godzilla's Revenge) or good-one of the best (Godzilla: Final Wars). 2. It's a build up. It builds suspense for the FINAL battle which was smart. If you saw it in 3D it looked like crap because it took place at night and 3D glasses and movies make things more blurry and kinda ruins the movie. Also 3D movies vacuum's your wallet. Also, if it showed every single fight scene, the movie would've been spoiled. 3. Audiences today are soo used to seeing non-stop action and explosions being in the movie more than the story (I'm looking at you Michel Bay), that it's starting to become a necessity. It's kinda showing how stupid people are getting. This is a gear change that should be in other movies so audiences can start focusing on story's or plot and less about the action and fight scenes.",0,0,Kajiu King,vIu85WQTPRc,0.012896825396825393,2014-09-10 04:30:06,False,False

Their are 2 monsters that Godzilla faces in this movie, therefore, they are the same type of creature. A mom creature, and a dad. The dad monster died by Godzilla's tail, when slamming into a building. The mom dies by Godzilla's fire, when Godzilla opened the mouth of the monster, and breathed the blue fire in her throat. Oh, and the monsters were feeding off of the radiation. Also, if jets, helicopters, etc.. flied near the monster within 5 miles, it will shut off all electricity. One more thing, the mom creature, is 10x more big than the dad. The mom couldn't fly, while the dad could.

2014-10-11T01:24:21,"I think most people's opinion on the movie depends on what their expectations were, for example I was very hyped, I followed the release for this movie for long before the movie came out, I knew about the MUTO, I knew that Godzilla wouldn't appear until halfway through the movie. So when I saw it, it blew my mind away. I don't like that people say there was no action, there was plenty of action spread out through the movie to keep people entertained, it's not just two hours of people talking. There are action scenes like the Janjira Powerplant, the MUTO escape, the Hawaii build up, the railway scene Godzilla at the bridge, and of course the final battle. Godzilla appears 57 minutes into the movie, which is usual for an origin story, and after that, he appears 25 minutes later, in between those 25 minutes there is the railway scene and the Las Vegas scene, and after it there is the final battle which is about 25-30 minutes long. So the last half of the movie there definitely is a lot of action. The first half only has two action scenes, so if you can be patient for the first half of the movie and let the anticipation build, you will be pleased. Oh, and another note the Muto appears 35 minutes into the film, so that means approximately every 20 minutes there is an exciting scene. So it is not boring. To those who haven't seen the movie, don't let the haters take control of your opinion create one of your own, it's a very fun movie.",0,0,cmccallwx,vIu85WQTPRc,0.09592592592592591,2014-10-11 01:24:21,False,False

If you didn't, that's fine, but it was a nice change of pace from all the action films we've seen, which think they have to have an explosion every five minutes to keep people interested in it, like dangling your keys in front of a baby. And I don't think it's possible to think this is the worst Godzilla movie ever made, neither do I think the 98 movie is, not even close. When stuff like ""Godzilla's Revenge"" exists, it's hard to go lower than that. And the 1998 Godzilla in all it's crappiness, was at least technically somewhat a functional movie, which is no praise, it was still horrible in every respect. This one I really really liked. The scarce use of Godzilla was good for this, because it's the introduction, they were just starting this up. In the next movie, I'd like to see more Godzilla, but still keep it smart and ""conservative"" compared to movies like Pacific Rim and other basic blockbusters.

2015-01-12T09:11:10,"The lack of Godzilla for much of it was fine, it was the human parts that didn't add up + the director kept pulling the rug from out under us every time we think we are going to see Godzilla bring on the pain (he does, but we just don't see it >:() until the end)  Would have made movie far more interesting film if Bryan Cranston's son died instead of him and we followed this character as he tries to seek both meaning and revenge for what this ""white whale"" of a beast did to him twice now. Tries to satisfy this need while running crossroads with the Ken Watanabe and the military's operation to contain what is all going on. This could provide some good character interactions and even square-offs between two men of science who have both lost much to great beasts (Cranston the mothra thing, Watanabe: Godzilla for example, by giving him some background where Godzilla was responsible somehow in their efforts to contain him in the past having cost Watanabe dearly somehow.) Watanabe is more paragon and has achieved peace with what he has lost at this point in his life, turning to study Godzilla and having accepted that what happened was nothing personal to him anymore that it could be with a force of nature (Maybe Watanabe loses someone dearly to him from radiation fallout, having to watch that person die horribly and sorrowfully from a fruitless attempt to control nature essentially, by trying to kill Godzilla simply out of fear back then, was greatly wounded and hateful as a result of it and even blamed Godzilla for it all happening, but in time in his past efforts to learn about him to destroy him, comes to understand that it was mans overreaction to the neutral, but awesome creature that caused the loss and not Godzillas. Bringing more weight to his line later in the film on 'man thinking they can control nature') and is now focused on trying to help the military stop what is going down with the mothra-thing. While Cranston is still fresh in his pain (his sons adding to it) and wants to see the mothra-thing dead at any cost. Eventually you could still have a similar scenario with the ticking nuke in the clutches of the mothra-mother-thing and Cranston finding himself in a situation where he could either let it blow up and kill everyone still stuck in the city in revenge or listen to Watanabe's wisdom from prior dialogue exchanges and put his hate aside and try and help the last remaining paratroopers sent in to disarm it and get it out and disabled for the sake of the city. Cranston does and Godzilla shows up (again) and kills the mothra-mother-thing as it pursues Cranston and what soldiers are left, in a way avenging Cranston on his behalf as Godzilla counters the massivve imbalance that were the two MUTO. In the end Cranston not only frees himself from the hate and suffering from his deep losses, but in turn learns some humility for the forces of nature and accepts that it can take as well as it can give. Hell I don't know how to end it totally, I guess the way it did in the film. Irregardless, I like to try and guess the basic plot of a movie before I go see it and this is what I thought it would be like. Oh well.

I actually could tell by watching the trailer and, if it wasn't for the lack of a better movie (at least according to that friend of mine) I wouldn't have wasted time and money that day and, instead, I would have seen a movie I liked for real, a few weeks or months later. Well, it's true, there wasn't any movie I definitely wanted to see at that time :/ Whatever, what's done is done, and I will watch every movie that has made it on my list eventually, just not in theaters.   Honestly, I'm not saying these to hate on anyone... but yh, I suppose that everyone who loves(!) the new Godzilla is too young to have a solid experience of good movies, or is simply tasteless and/or incapable of judging objectively. To elaborate a bit... it's mainly that it's so full of silly cliches. And nothing particularly exciting happens.

A house plagued by a mated pair of snakes is entered by a mongoose, who by default hunts an animal that is a threat to man and is such the 'hero'. Tracking them down, he fights the male cobra first and kills him, while the unhatched eggs are destroyed before they produce more snakes. This incites the rage of the grieving female, who tries to take revenge by killing the young boy, the main human character, but is saved by the mongoose. The mongoose, by simply being a predator, is hailed a hero and returns to his home, now in good terms with the humans as a pet-protector.  Now replace Rikki the mongoose with our favorite atomic lizard and the cobras with the MUTOs.

Works as a crescendo from start to finish. 6. Godzilla kills the monsters in really badass ways. 7. Fantastic, convincing Production design, sets, and huge military involvement 8. Camera usually from a human perspective, immersive and emphasizes the scale 9.

The characters and acting were all great, especially from Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston. Gareth Edwards did a fantastic job directing. The action scenes were all tense, exciting, and beautifully filmed! The score was awesome. And finally, the film payed huge respect to the classic Japanese Godzilla films, which I am a huge fan of! I saw this twice in the theater, and I happily placed the dvd next to my Godzilla movie collection! This movie was to me the perfect Godzilla movie! It proved that an American version of Godzilla could still be done correctly, even after the disaster from 1998! It is a great addition to the Godzilla franchise, and a great movie on it's own!

2015-07-18T04:04:07,"Godzilla is a 2014 American science fiction monster film directed by Gareth Edwards and a reboot of Toho's Godzilla franchise. The film is set mostly in the present day, fifteen years after a discovery that leads to the awakening of two giant creatures, known as ""MUTOs"", who in turn awaken a much much much much much much more larger, more indistrcible, more bigger and badder more terriofied, more atomic radioactive flame breathing and more destructive, ancient alpha prehstoric predator dinosaur known as ""Godzilla""[Note 3] whose existence has been kept secret by the U.S. government since 1954. It stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, and Bryan Cranston. The film is a co-production between Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures, with the latter also distributing the film worldwide, except in Japan where it was distributed by Toho. It is the second Godzilla film to be completely filmed and produced by an American studio, the first being the 1999 film of the same name.[Note 3] The project initially began in 2004 and was originally intended to be an IMAX short film but was later transferred to Legendary for development as a feature film. Principal photography took place in the United States and Canada in 2013. Godzilla was released worldwide in 2D, 3D and IMAX on May 15, 2014. Critical reception for the film has been positive, with some praising its slow pace and build-up, while others criticized the film's cutting-away approach, a lack of depth in the script and characters, the amount of screen-time Godzilla was given, and that Godzilla was the primary focus of the film. Regardless, Gareth Edwards' directing and the film's visual effects, music, creature designs, and Bryan Cranston's performance were praised by critics and fans, who had also praised Edwards for honoring the spirit and legacy of the Godzilla character and franchise.[6] Godzilla was an immediate box office success upon its release and finished with a worldwide total of $528 million at the end of its theatrical run. The film's success prompted Legendary to proceed with sequels with Gareth Edwards attached to direct a planned trilogy with the second film targeted for a June 2018 release.",0,0,MALCOLM CARTER,vIu85WQTPRc,0.1908492822966507,2015-07-18 04:04:07,False,False

However, after a meeting with Edwards, Watanabe was convinced that a Hollywood version can indeed be done and invested complete faith in Edwards. Watanabe stated, ""If you are telling the Godzilla story, you cannot separate it from the nuclear element, and the first thing I asked was whether there was going to be the nuclear element, as that now, in Japan, is a really sensitive problem. I was worried about how I could use that and how I could make that okay, but Gareth understood those feelings.""[18] Watanabe's character is named after the director of various Godzilla films, Ishiro Honda, and after the scientist who killed Godzilla or not in the 1954 original film, Dr. Daisuke Serizawa. Ford's father and former lead engineer at the Janjira nuclear plant until its destruction in 1999. Cranston has said that Edwards' approach to the film and to its characterization is what drew him to the project. He stated, ""The most important thing about this version of Godzilla is the characterization. The characters in this are real, well drawn. [Edwards] takes the time to really establish who these people are, that you root for them, that you invest in these characters, and that you care for them. That's the best part of it.""[19] Cranston additionally added, ""I wouldn't be here if it was just, 'Look out, this monster is smashing destroying crushing everything!' Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight"".[20] Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, ""Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic.""[12][21] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before joining Godzilla.[22] Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be ""the word"", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film.[23] Cranston would later admit that killing off Joe Brody was a ""narrative mistake"".[24]",0,0,MALCOLM CARTER,vIu85WQTPRc,0.1603729603729604,2015-07-18 04:11:49,False,False

The movie was a box office success, easily earning back its budget and then some with a roaring 540 million worldwide. 3. Thanks to critical and financial success, a sequel was confirmed to be released in 2018. 3. TOHO, the Japanese film studio that CREATED and OWNS Godzilla, were thrilled by the movie. They loved it. 4. In fact, they loved it so much, they are ALLOWING Legendary to use more of their classic monsters in the sequel - Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah - which are arguably the superstars of the franchise. 5. Not only that, due to Legendary's success at reviving the King of the Monsters, they announced that a brand new Japanese Godzilla movie will come out in 2016.   Still think this movie ""sucked""? Clearly a lot of competent people - creators, critics, execs, etc. - do not.  As a lifelong Godzilla fan, I've see ALL of the 28 Japanese Godzilla movies (even the terrible ones), and I can honestly say to Garreth Edwards, Legendary and all the people involved: ""Well fucking done.

I really wanted my money back after sitting through 2 hours of this nonsense . I'm not even arguing Godzilla's screen time.  Alien, Jaws, Cloverfield all had limited monster screen time but those movies were clearly about the creatures. So when the creature wasn't around everyone talked about it. It drove the story.  This convoluted mess was entirely different,  this movie isn't even about Godzilla he's just a second banana. He's the good monster saving us from the bad alien Mutos. They don't even say his name until the move is 3/4 over. People that praise this shit storm of a movie aren't really Godzilla fans anyway and probably never even seen the original.             Toho producer Tomoyuki Tanaka said in a interview back in 1984 that turning Godzilla into a hero nearly killed the franchise in the 1970's. So when they brought Godzilla back in 1984 they had to make him  a mean villain again.  Please don't compare this watered down piece of Hollywood fluff to the 1954 original atomic doomsday masterpiece. It can't hold a candle to Ishiro Honda's work. Edward's direction of this movie was truly maddening for longtime Godzilla fans like me. He has a nasty habit of cutting away from the action and slowing the movie to a crawl. Just like he did in his other movie, ""Monsters"". I never wanted Edwards to direct. I wanted Del Toro or Michael Bay. That's right. I said it.

2015-11-30T18:56:10,"I know this movie came out over a year ago, but here is my take on it. While yes the military son was pretty boring, and not a fun character, the military has always in the franchise is in it in some capacity. So bitching about the military makes no sense to me ( the human character's have always been eh anyway). Also the cuts were pretty bad for the first fight with the male M.U.T.O (I was a tad disappointed in that scene), but when you see Godzilla appear later on it is so glorious it makes you feel like ""Yes this is the king of the monsters"". The designs for the monsters looked great, and I loved the M.U.T.O's because they are a new type of villain for Godzilla that feel fresh. It is a shame that practical effects weren't really used for the monsters, but I thought the fights were good, and felt really good seeing these fights happen. Overall I'm saying the movie did have bad moments, but I thought it was a great movie, and still better then some of the older Godzilla movie (what even was the Godzilla vs Hedorah movie).",1,2,supermegatron1245,vIu85WQTPRc,0.08612121212121211,2015-11-30 18:56:10,False,False
