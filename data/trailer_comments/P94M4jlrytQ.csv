The original Star wars only had 1 female and 1 black guy, I agree there could have been more female and black casting, but replacing the cast with only a female and a black guy is way too radical in my opinion. It just screams PC and makes the story hard to believe... I would have written it with Luke having 2 sons, one goes rogue and attempts to join the dark side but coming together Luke and Han's son bring them back together and bring balance back to the force. Han's son pilots the falcon and then we rock and roll. But they went the total opposite.

I actually liked the setup of TFW...hated the feminism stuff but I have no problem with female protagonist as long as too much emphasis isn't put on the fact that she's female (which seems even more sexist that just having a male lead) I'd give that film an 8.5, I really liked it other than Rey being OP (which I'd assumed would be explained later....)

2019-08-26T20:55:19,its either a force vision on ach-to or its a force vision taking place on the planet where the death star crashed possibly in the death star itself. if it was on dagobah you would see fog and vines in the background so its doubtful that it is the same cave luke went through. this vision seems to take place in a room and or cave with reflective surfaces. if it is a room then it would have to be a room that has taken alot of damage like the death star for the panels to be ruined like that.    fact is they simple would and cannot bring palpatine back at this time due to the whole chosen one destroyed the sith thing. the only reason they have snoke and kylo is through a loop hole where they are not technically sith. this means in the movie their will be a point where on endore (where i assume the deathstar is) rey will have vissions near or within the death star of palpatine. given all this i suspect that the death star is a force nexus of the dark side no different than dagobahs caves. rey is probably going through a hallway and experiencing hallucinations like hearing palatines voice only to in the end confront herself.     at the end i suspect instead of seeing rey turn to the darkside kylo ren will turn to the light. after all its hard to ignore the fact that he is more of the anakin sky walker in this trilogy then rey due to the fact that since episode 7 he has been struggling to get rid of the good inside of him. the final fight on the deathstar looks like a deliberate choice by abrams to resemble anakin and obiwans fight on mustufar. the fight will likely end with kylo turning to the light with rise of skywalker referencing him. instead of falling to the dark side he will rise to the light side.,0,0,You cant handle my name!,P94M4jlrytQ,0.04601449275362318,2019-08-26 20:55:19,True,True

I like Mark Hamill. I love his voice acting but as Skywalker his acting was mediocre. I'm not saying that the Last Jedi wasn't terrible but man the fans are acting like the originals were god's gift to man. They were all right.

Cloning is not hard when you have Kamino and the best minds in the galaxy for cloning.  Rey was a clone in transit who was thought lost when the ship was destroyed when the empire fell. Being a death world, she could not be sensed by Snoke (Also Palpatine in a failing and cobbled together body), Kylo or Luke (Also why Kenobi picked Tatooine to hide Luke, his aunt and uncle being there a happy coincidence) and being engineered as the host of Palpatine would be engineered to be more powerful than his previous form, innately becoming stronger as a result (which is also why Rey can magically do shit she‚Äôs not trained to do and proficiently.) The ghost of Palpatine possessing people, particularly the sons of Solo, is canon in the EU as is the creation of Force Sensitive clones in FU:2. These are pretty old and accepted concepts within the universe of SW.  She has no linage or family. Only endless versions of herself as seen in the cave sequence. Endlessly dead clones. Only her. The literal exact same scene occurs when Galen Marek enters the cave on Dagobah and sees endless versions of himself before finding out that he‚Äôs a clone. Luke, while training Rey, senses only an all too familiar darkness inside her....you thought he was talking about Vader, he was talking about Palpatine.   Rey is the bad guy. She is going to be possessed by Palpatine and Palpatine is going to try and kill Kylo, being of no more use to him as he intended on possessing him after the loss of his creation.

The trailer looks cool, probably because of all the nostalgia shots included as well, but I doubt I'll come back to the cinemas to support your work anymore, Disney Star Wars, and that's sad for me to say because this franchise was my childhood, and the generation before me. But when we didn't like The Last Jedi you called us sexist, mysoginists, manbabies and everything else under the sun.

You find the biggest woman on the planet and there will always be a bigger man....look at GoT....brianne is a big woman but the mountain is 3x her size. The whole bad ass woman thing destroyed the greatest series to ever hit the theater. And fn Disney with all there woman are so tough and we exalt the woman sooooo much couldnt protect 2 women at there theme park from getting there asses kicked by some thug for over 4min....Disney is a joke and killed star wars with this concept and just total shity acting and story lines....like zero training but this chick is a jedi knight give me a fn break.....thank you Disney thank you so much for killing the greatest cinematic experience of our lifetime.....fn pukes,0,0,Shane Heisler,P94M4jlrytQ,0.022163742690058497,2019-08-27 20:24:48,True,True

People wanted something different for the new trilogy and yet, when The Last Jedi came out (obviously not a great Star Wars movie but still entertaining) you got so caught up in your stupid theories you couldn't accept an original concept based on a beloved series that gave us Jar Jar fucking Binks! This is a movie! It shouldn't be the site for ""it should be this"" ""it should be that"" or ""I don't like that design"". You're entitled to your opinion but until you design something for a project as complex as filmmaking, I'm not listening to a damn thing you say. Do what a movie is designed to make you do/feel: be distracted from your boring and mundane lives and be entertained by taking it at face value even if you think you know everything about it and the world/universe it is set in.

There's no real comprehension of what you're watching. You don't feel like it's a place or a creature, or an alien, or a place. CG is way over used. Movies like Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and other classics benefit from using CG only when absolutely necessary. Take the time to make a movie, not a visual wonder, and you might start to care more about the character development too.

Actually no, that's not quite true, I'd be interested in what they do with the KOTOR movie project. But as far as the main storyline goes, yeah, sorry, The Last Jedi killed it.  Honestly, if Disney wanted to save Star Wars, they should have treated TLJ as an alternate 'dark side' branch with the Empire winning and should have made a new Episode 8 which was actually good and didn't shit all over the original franchise.  In short, I don't think people were asking for too much going into this trilogy, even if the movies were bad, if it had Han/Leia/Luke all venturing together again people would have liked it.

2019-08-28T23:58:41,"So as the only guy who may be defending this movie, I have to say that the twist of Ray being the villain would not only make a FANTASTIC twist, but would not only tie into the Title, but would also be the culmination of a wider story.   First, the tie in with the title, Ben (AKA Kylo) would have to face a enemy who was not only his equal but who has shown to be better then him on multiple occasions. Therefore, should they fight early in the film, and Ray win, then go onto take Kylo‚Äôs place in the First order, Kylo would have to RISE from the darkness as a Skywalker and face Ray again.  Second, if you look at the course of the last 2 movies, Ray and Kylo have been trying to be one thing, Ray the Jedi, Kylo the sith. They both have said they feel out of place and need to know what role they are supposed to play in this story, so for Ray to finally embrace who she was MEANT to be, a Sith, would force Kylo to accept his role as the Jedi.  And as part of a wider story, if you look at the prequels and the OT, they both follow Arcs of characters searching for there path, and we have seen a trilogy of a hero turned villain, and a Ordinary boy turned hero, so why not have a trilogy of a Hero turn true villain?  Just a rant to voice my thoughts, and to say STOP BASHING THIS TRILOGY FOR NOT BEING LIKE THE ORIGINAL!!! IT IS ITS OWN STORY!!!!

2019-08-29T01:59:18,"The nostalgia bait is strong with this one, ironic given how much effort Disney has put into 'destroying the past' eh? And Rey possibly going over to the dark side, honestly how many fans care at this point given the utter disrespect they've shown all the O.T. (original timeline) characters huh? I know the Star Wars fanboys will see this film regardless of how many times Disney bends their favorite franchise over and defiles it utterly but really at what point do you say this franchise is as dead as Han Solo? Bringing back people's memories of all the old films and all the old characters only reminds people of two things Disney. #1 how badly you treated their favorite characters and #2 how shitty, disjointed and inconsistent your so-called 'trilogy' is compared to the original films. Hell, even the prequel films were better at consistency and continuity than your jumbled mess. That's what happens though when you hire directors based on how much Kathleen Kennedy can wrap them around her little finger and introduce their agenda to the franchise as opposed to you know TELLING A GOOD F**KING STORY! Oh and when two different directors completely disregard each other's ideas. Great work Disney, top marks. Can't wait to see you destroy Marvel the same way but don't expect to get any of MY MONEY for phase 4 films if they head in the same direction as Star Wars. #FuckDisney",0,1,Michael Ray,P94M4jlrytQ,0.14918981481481483,2019-08-29 01:59:18,True,True

His Character is shallow, uninteresting, has little or no impact in the film = Token black guy clearly parroting the original role of Han Solo.

I do have to say scanning these hot takes that the sore assness of this community is 2nd to none.  "" the first part is from when Star Wars was good"".  The OT sucked in every way the PT did and the NT has.  All SW movies suck somewhat because no 2 sw fans would make the same movie.  The OT was paced terribly, the effects aged for shit, Luke was a flawed hero then and is flawed now.   the best thing to come out of the OT was scene 38 reimagined.  Star Wars is the universe.  It is the possibility that the scope and scale of our universe represents.  Hopefully we can tell a hundred more stories in it.  I'll probably dislike large parts of all of them.

What if, Rey is a Force-sensitive clone created by Palpatine in the Unknown Regions? It would explain her connection to the Force, along with her numerous skills that some have said make her a Mary Sue. After all, any leader, even a Sith, would want his underlings/potential consciousness vessels to be capable enough to carry out his bidding.  Her ‚Äòparents‚Äô were simply people who took her away, leaving her in Jakku to hide her, using the guise of scavengers selling their daughter to avoid any suspicion. That‚Äôs why she sees herself in the vision in the Last Jedi, she doesn‚Äôt have any parents, and the other Reys were just other clones.

Obviously Star Wars makes huge $$$, so it‚Äôs the reason it continues after Lucas, but I think it‚Äôs the full story of the redemption and balance of the story of Anakin/Vader. Even in the sequels. The lightsaber calls to Rey, the mighty Skywalker blood in Kylo, the force connection of Rey/Kylo, (even the name Kylo - sKYwalker/soLO) brings it all together. I think the RISE of skywalker, is simply the balance of light (Rey) and dark (Kylo) coming together in a way, to defeat the manipulator of the force (midi-chlorians) in the character who is trying to wield the power of the force, ‚Äòunnaturally‚Äô thus bringing imbalance - none other than  Palpatine. The reason for Palpatines return gives play to him understanding the secret to keep one from dying, even in spirit form. The unnatural bend in the force must end...making way for a new chapter of Star Wars with the young force sensitive individuals. - The manifestation of Anakin, in Rey/Kylo, and it‚Äôs dual-sided power, the Rise of Skywalker, will be to complete the prophecy of Anakin, the one who will bring balance to the force...ending the Skywalker saga...

I really hope I'm wrong in saying this, but I have very little doubt Rey will ever experience a single loss or moment that might even hint at failure, as we've seen in the past 2 movies Disney produced.    I don't know if I'm alone in this, but the only character I really feel attached to is Kylo. He's the only character who we really understand the backstory and motives to his actions. Rey? Not one bit. Snoke? nope. Finn? A little, but he's a male, so Kathleen will just make sure he's a bumbling idiot who did one good thing and anything he tries to do that might be good will be portrayed as foolish by a female lead (IE last jedi battering ram 'scene').    Rey's character hasn't been developed one bit. The only thing that's developed are her powers. For some reason, Disney thinks these two types of story development are the same. I feel like they accidentally develop kylo's character every time he fights Rey because Disney makes him lose.

Episode VIII: The Shadow Empire - Opening scene Princess Leia Organa has passed away with Luke, Ben Solo and Lando attending the funeral. Luke discovered some evidence of a foul play in her sister's death with only one witness who can give the answer; a girl named Rey who fled the scene before Leia's death. and so Luke decides to find Rey to discover the truth with Ben Solo his Nephew and apprentice. Meanwhile a series of unknown attacks has been terrorizing the New Republic, there are also reports of sightings of fleet of warships of unknown origin just outside the borders of known space, The death of Princess Organa has also brought problems of its own, it seems that the New republic has only remained united to her sheer will alone. without her cracks begun to show and the divisions within the senate is threatening to fracture the galaxy into civil war. Han Solo together with Chewie has just returned from a four year journey from the unknown space bearing with them troubling news. There was also a Jedi expedition to the unknown space 19 years ago but the ship never returned and was considered a failure this is also where luke lost his wife who was the leader of the said expedition the last transmission they gave was to Leia Organa which she claimed to have deleted and remained silent of what the message was. Is there someone manipulating the events from behind the scene? Will Luke and Ben know the truth behind Leia's death? and what did Han and Chewie discovered in the unknown space?    Episode IX: Legacy of Skywalker - Opening Scene The unknown fleet of ships has revealed their true identity as the Empire of the Hand founded by the late Emperor Palpatine in the unknown space. Admiral Thrawn the supreme leader of this mysterious empire has issued an ultimatum to the New Republic to surrender unconditionally. The Republic who just recently suffered massive losses after their fleet were caught off guard and devastated by the sudden attack of Thrawn's Grand fleet. most of the military shipyards of the republic were either destroyed or inoperative in simultaneous bombings by the empire of the hand's agents within the Republic. Luke, Ben and Rey together with their new companion Finn a clone trooper from the now defunct Galactic Empire who finally realized the war is over traveled together to an ancient massive shipyard called ""Star Forge"" there they found out who was behind the death of Leia a clone of the Emperor Palpatine. Leia discovered the star forge through the help of the wife of Luke who sent her the last transmission of the Jedi expedition before it went missing and never returned. Leia was planning to reveal it to the senate the very year she died with the plan of destroying the ancient structure to make sure it won't fall in the wrong hands. a battle ensue between Luke and his companions against the Clone of Emperor Palpatine and his droids. The droids were no match against the Jedi master but before Luke and Ben get closed to the Emperor Rey pulled a red lightsaber revealing her as a Sith. She then revealed that she was trained by the Late Emperor in the ways of the Sith and showed her the kindness that no one has bothered to give her when her mother died. Finn and Ben surprise at the revelation have no choice but to face their friend both with conflicting feelings for Rey. The Clone Emperor younger and stronger dueled with Luke who's age has finally starting to slow the legendary Jedi, but Luke still manage to best the Sith Lord giving him a fatal blow with his last breath telling the Jedi that it is a mistake to destroy the star forge and that it is their only chance to defeat what is coming. Withe the death of the clone emperor Rey suffered a telepathic blast from the emperor force ghost telling her repeatedly to avenged him and kill Luke and so force push Ben and Finn and went straight to duel Luke. The Jedi master not understanding the pain and anger of Rey to him ask the girl why and here another revelation... ""I am Rey Jade and you killed my mother!"" she then slash Luke while he was shocked to know Mara Jade his first student and wife who he thought to have been lost in the Jedi expedition to unknown space was survived by their Daughter and in someway was discovered by the emperor and turned against him. Luke then embrace his Daughter and told her that there's never a day goes by that he regret not telling her mother to stay and to hell with the expedition and that if there ever was a way to help her it is to save their daughter and pull her out of the dark side and into light. Rey is now even more confused flashback of her past their ship fired upon by a fleet of pirate ships, how they escape and crash landed on a desolate world her mother dying soon after and her rescue by the Late emperor Palpatine. Ben and Finn finally caught up with two but Luke is already dying from his wound inflicted by Rey, she then run from them and activated the self destruct sequence for the star forge. Ben and Finn took the dying Jedi master with them and rush to the hanger only time to see the Millennium Falcon waiting for them. The star forge explode merely a second after the Millennium Falcon escape. Rey also survive flying an imperial tie fighter.    Episode XI: Thrawn's Gambit - opening scene The republic is in dire danger of total collapse. the senate is split between surrendering to Thrawn and his shadow empire or fight to the bitter end. General Lando and admiral ackbar have already assembled the remaining fleet of the new republic; an assortment of old refurbished capital ships, confiscated imperial destroyers and small re-purpose vessel. they may be old but numerous enough to give the empire of the hand a descent fight. Thrawn was saddened when he heard the death of the late Emperor and his Clone a news brought by Rey who now called herself mary sue of the dark side lol lets just say Darth Rey oohh spooky! so back to the story. Thrawn is the closest to father Rey can ever have in her younger days. The emperor was strick and merciless when it comes to training Rey in the ways of the Sith. He even went to far by brainwashing Rey into believing his father luke exiled her mother and abandoned her to her fate it drove her almost to the edge. but it was Thrawn who taught her to survive and the only one genuine enough to truly care for her though she never seen the true intention of the emperor thinking it was tough love and never had any suspicion of the old goat but to simply ready her to be her successor. this is the part I'm starting to get lazy so I'll leave you guys to think how it ends needs to sleep haha :P",0,0,Mike Millanes,P94M4jlrytQ,0.02276448697501329,2019-09-11 10:45:16,True,True

2019-09-16T01:41:22,"The last jedi seriously hurt my love for star wars, and after all the fallout between anti straight white male sexist Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson, and the fans i said it would take undoing all the horrible mistakes last jedi made for me to be interested again, i hoped it would renew my interest at the very least but i wasnt holding my breath, but by the looks of things they are in full damage control mode trying to fix how the fans were called racist and sexist because half of 1% of the fan base harassed kelly marie tran, and the other 99% were told how evil and how much of a piece of shit we are for having a penis for 2 and a half hours straight, and didnt like to be called a piece of shit because we have balls instead of a vagina. But bringing jj abrams back peaked my interest, and since i know hes not a sexist lying piece of shit like Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson, and then brought the emperor back in some capacity which made me even more interested, then they imply reys parents were actually characters rather than drug addicts that sold her for drugs, then they go and give kylo ren his bad ass helmet back, THEN they have a fight on the destroyed ruins of the fucking death star, THEN THEN they give rey a dual bladed folding unstable lightsaber (that she probably made from kylo rens saber) while shes dressed in full black sith robes HOLY FUCKIN SHIT im loving everything im seeing so far. Im still not entirely won back, i need to actually see it obviously and i would personally like to know how other fans that were alienated by the sexist stooges over there, will now feel after seeing rise of skywalker once it comes out, if they even go to see it at all since they were so brutally demonized by the media for not wanting to be called a piece of shit for no other reason than race and gender. So they still have ti win me back and theres a long way to go andbil never truly forgive them for lying to the world about their own fans and tricking all mainstream media to join in on the lets hate straight white men train. And just for the record, im only about half white and bisexual, and my political beliefs lean much further left in almost every way, i dont want to get in to politics too much im talking about star wars here afterall, but my point is that im not some alt right anti sjw nor any kind of conservstive or right winger of any kind, but i can plainly see from the outside looking in that straight white men are the new bad guys because people 200 years ago had slaves and the owners happened to be white or whatever. Ok maybe thats gigantic over simplification for really bad things that did happen and i shouldn't downplay the impact of those horrible things, but my family was all slaves on both sides, ny father is polish and a tiny bit irish among a few other things but his grandparents were all slaves and so were all his ancestors as far as we can trace them, same with my ma except that shes polish native american and a few other things and her ancestors were slaves too even the white polish ones on both sides, so im not racist and no one can pretend i am or that slavery was okay or anything like that. My point is that its so obvious straight white men have been demonized and that made it so hard to like star wars when the people running it are sexist racist pieces of shit, and yes you can be sexist against men, and racist against white people, for example, Charlemagne ""Tha God"" is black, but hes one of the most racist pieces of shit ive ever seen in my life, and anyone who thinks you can disagree with objective fact is a complete moron and is so dumb theyre dangerous",0,0,Revolutionary Cinema Productions,P94M4jlrytQ,-0.05301367876110142,2019-09-16 01:41:22,True,True

2019-10-01T12:41:51,I am so exited about all but all in rise of skywalker last episode of skywalker saga and i hope that after garbage episode 7 and 8 episode 9 will have end that star wars sada deserves My qusteions for episode 9 are  Rey Will she find who is her parents or she is clone or she is related with sidious or she is related with luke or obi wan Her lightsaber??? Is that luke s or she constructed her new lightsaber Dark side rey?? IS that vision clone or she really turned to the dark side? Her connection with KYLO and is she related with him?    KYLO REN - BEN SOLO I have many questions about him Will he find sidious?  Will he become sidious apprentice?  How will he react on Sidious return and does he know his backstory about Vader and Luke?? And hoow will sidious treat him?  Will he die and will he turn back to the light and how is he with knights of ren??? And has he and now connection with rey and are they somehow related and they are cousins or both skywalker???   DARTH Sidious - palpatine  How he will return??? Is he ghost is he true palpatine and palpatine from other episodes was just clone who knows???  Is he somehow related with rey or kylo??? Has he power or he is very old but i think he is yet very strong? Will he construct new death star with old pieces or he has a new weapon??? Is he somehow connected with snoke or he is snoke himself but he was palpatine all along time???   Knights of Ren They are finnaly in film and that is fantastic? Have they connection with sidious and why they werent in episode 8 and in 7( this in episode 7 was vision)??? Are they connected with Vader and do they know all about Vader his rise and turning back to the light and are they powerful???   Luke Skywalker  Will he continue Rey's Jedi training and will we just hear his voice or he will appear as ghost in some scenes? Is he Rey's father?   Anakin Skywalker Film has title Rise of skywalker and this all episodes in saga haven't Skywalker in title so has this title any connection with anakin and will anakin come back as force ghost to stop palpatine?? I don't understand why Star wars choose to come back palpatine cause that mean that anakin's sacrfice don t mean anything and that isn't fair cause this all saga is about chosen one and chosen one is anakin and something is still troubling me!! Will we finnaly in this last episode find out who is his father??? But main question is will he come back to help others??  Leia skywalker  She will die in this episode and that everybody knows but what is her role in film? Will she fight with kylo or sidious? How Disney and Lucasfilm used her unrealesed footage from other episodes?   My last 2 questions is Will this last episode have fantastic and proper end of saga or and this episode will be garbage?  Who is skywalker who will rise in episode XI?????

2019-10-08T00:00:44,"Rey is the worst character they could've possibly created. Straight off the bat she's incredibly strong. 10 seconds of training from luke she's more powerful than any jedi with the force. She beat Kylo Ren like he was some noob with a plastic sword. No suspence, no nail biting sequences. Just boring. It's as if you already know Rey will win and that makes me so apathetic towards watching any of these new films. It's all a cash grab, no real storytelling with twists and turns leaving you at the edge of your seat. They have kylo Ren be the main 'villain' in all 3 movies for fucks sake. Up the stakes, bring in a real sith to fuck some shit up. Let Rey get fucked up or something just change it up already. I want Anikan back, with awesome lightsaber duels, new plot and suspence. Get rid of this Mary Sue. She's only there to please the feminists and SJW's and I'm so sick of it. I don't care what anyone says, episode III will always be the best in my opinion. Great storytelling, the first dark star wars film with real violence and dark scenes as he became Vader, we watch Anakin go through hell and battle his demons and succumbing to the dark side for a debatable reason. He wanted to save Padme because he's already lost so much including his mother, so he didn't want to see it happen again. His arc was awesome, and he eventually became the most feared sith in the series, even Kylo Ren knew he couldn't live up to Vader. Rey has to go. When she dies I'll feel nothing. George Lucas didn't create her, she's just a pandering Disney creation which sucks.",0,0,Shane Daniel,P94M4jlrytQ,0.09983766233766235,2019-10-08 00:00:44,True,True

That's why I won't play many video games anymore.

You just killed star wars why is it because marvel let there series die well you saw how happy that made people yay tony stark dies ya I bet everyone was super happy about that, I mean really now imagine how happy people are going to be young girls playing with rey action figures only to be shut down and depressed. Will there really be a reason even to have a giant part of disney land or world be star wars is if part of my generation doesnt even know what those two words mean anymore in 20 years. Think about how excited fans were when solo was released I know I was. Think about the giant build up you made in the force awakens do you really want that to just be a whole bunch of notes burnt up in a fire pit! You gave my generation something new to geek out about we never really understood the old star wars series until disney introduced us to the force awakens were there was actually a massive point to watch all of the old movies. You showed us that no matter were you come from or the situation your in you can have a massive impact on the main picture.             You introduced fn2187 a random storm trooper that saw what they were doing was wrong and turned to the light side like in the clone wars. Next you have rey who just happens to be there at the time when bb8 gets captured and has the blood line of a jedi not even knowing it because she had been living on a planet literraly with a nickname of know were. Ya I get it the last jedi was a depressing movie but every time its sad a new hope a sort of peace is brought to the galaxy in order to restore balance to the force, that's what star wars is all about. I mean what series are you planning on replacing this cant be space balls that was just the funny version of star wars and it cant be star trek because that ended a long time ago only because people couldn't actually geek out about it as much as star wars. So many of us have and even tried to make predictions about were rey originated from when the force awakens was released I wasn't even a huge geek or dork whatever you want to categorize  me as or a person that actually tries to enjoy life. Today it is raining, pooring even outside were I live and now I know why. Disney produced two of the greatest star wars movies yet that people loved and enjoyed don't let that die keep it going and oh for the love of god don't you dare turn anakins driod evil I mean what is wrong with you how on earth does this go with the story line at all.              I thought my age of this generation would be the last to actually even care about star wars well guess what I was wrong there is a 7th grader that I see every day in the hallway that were's at least some sort of star wars shirt to whatever class he goes to and another that I have so far seen at least four times when driving home wearing a orange backpack that has a rebel symbol on it. I love this idea everything about it for the first time I had actually began to pay attention to details in the movies like how on the attack on hoth the at at itself was easily taken down by snow speeders compared to in the last jedi when there on the mineral planet they have wire cutters so that they cant be taken down so easily. I put this out there to show how much more improvements you could make to star wars itself to make the story plot better by making both sides make improvements to there strategies so its a more interesting story plot. To sum this whole thing up I just wanted to state please just don't be that guy. Also if you are i'm definitaly not coming! Trust me it was depressing enough to see dream works just completely end how to train your dragon.

2019-10-21T07:40:09,"(Begin Rant) Wow it‚Äôs true. Star Wars fans are completely toxic. The comments are full of hate for a film they have already decided to despise. How do you know a ""Star Wars Fan""? Well they hate the prequel trilogy, hate the new Star Wars films, and they cant stand the original trilogy now that it‚Äôs been special editioned. They also hate the new books, want the EU back as cannon, and they feel the comics are fanfic along with the animated stuff. So basically they are fans of 3 films that only exist in their imaginations, and in actuality do not resemble what they recall at all. I have never seen a fan community more determined to burry what they ""Love‚Äô. Thank God some fans still remain true. It‚Äôs truly Jedi vs Sith. Oh and while I have plenty of issues with The Last Jedi, 90% of what you all complain about is totally in Universe. If you pay attention the film did not break anything. Thou I admit that whole subversion of expectations thing is some of Round Heads BS. Last Jedi needed more Luke Skywalker. Put the deleted scenes back into the flick, add a younger Luke flashback, fix the choreography in the throne room fight, rethink that Casino Sequence, and add in a scene that better explains Haldo‚Äôs motivations. Sadly George Lucas would have totally fixed those shortcomings for streaming release, but we all criticized changes being made to the movies to such a degree that Disney won‚Äôt touch them after release. If it were not for celebration being what it is, I would swear Star Wars fans have all been consumed by hate. Imagine Marvel Fans turning on the MCU because of those first couple  of Thor movies. Yes they were bad. More recent example? Captain Marvel. That flick makes no sense. End Game has some big logic problems, and they have so many fake deaths that we just assume anyone that dies will be back. Hell they introduced time travel and a multiverse. Marvel villains make plans that happen to work out by chance. Not to mention everyone Tony has ever pissed off seems to come back years later seeking vengeance. But Luke Skywalker was not like I remember him 30 years ago! How dare he change based on his life experiences! How unrealistic.

2019-10-22T01:54:13,"I'm not going to watch this movie until it comes to Netflix.   I never watched The Last Jedi until long it got out of the theatres.   I love Star Wars, if my channel name doesn't give it away. It was, and still is, what I grew up on and what has influenced me the most. The OT, the Prequels, the shows, I love it all. When Disney bought Star Wars, I was excited. More than excited, I was thrilled that the story I had grown up on would continue on. The hype surrounding The Force Awakens, all their projects really, kept me excited for the movies and other media.   When The Force Awakens came out, I left the theatre... apathetic. It was not bad, but nor was it good. The movie was just... average. I didn't hate Rey, I found her as one-note as Anakin and Luke, but I didn't hate her. Was she overpowered? Yes, but it hadn't really begun to irk me yet. I worried, for a time, that maybe my love for Star Wars the movies and shows had died out. I still played the games and loved every minute of them, so perhaps there inlied the issue?    Alas, it was not. I still loved the first six and the two Clone Wars shows. It was then that I realized that The Force Awakens was not bad, it was boring. The movie was the diet version of A New Hope in every way. Every character was a cheap, dumbed-down version of their predecessor. Hux to Tarkin, Kylo to Vader, Rey to Luke, etc.    What's more, Rebels proved to be uninteresting and childish. It is a kid's show, granted, but Clone Wars was as well and it managed darker themes and still remained child-friendly. The first Battlefront had also failed spectacularly, but we all knew that.   Rogue One and Solo were improvements, but they were removed from the main trilogy, and better yet, different. Cliched, yes, but they were something Star Wars had never done before. A gritty war film and a heist comedy!    Then came The Last Jedi.    My issues with The Last Jedi are long and expansive. Everything off about The Force Awakens was increased by ten-fold here. It felt like a fanfiction, given how poorly it was written with its new OCs crammed in. Rey became too powerful, who is there left to even challenge her? Palpatine risen from the dead, the puppeted corpse of Vader? Every instant reeked of rushed production, mixed ideas about how the movie should progress, and any number of other issues that I won't get into because this comment has gotten long enough.   Watching this, I didn't feel excitement. I felt... bored. Tired, rundown even. Watching all the moments from the old movies, I came to realize that Disney has given up. Best milk nostalgia instead of creating something new and exciting, after all, it failed the other two times.    If Disney doesn't care, why should I? Why should I give a damn about these new movies when Disney can't be bothered to try?   I'm not going to watch this movie until it comes to Netflix, whether it is to have my fears confirmed or not remains to be seen.",1,1,Magos Marech Ferracioli,P94M4jlrytQ,0.10603535353535355,2019-10-22 01:54:13,True,True

And yet.  Seen this, know this, what this indicates is a lack of confidence in the new material, if they only dare show us one minute of new spaceship footage and a few seconds of lightsabres.

2019-12-10T06:37:42,"Honestly it's incredibly annoying how many people are frustrated with this trailer and trilogy. Literally everything that has happened is pretty much on point with what George Lucas always envisioned as what happened. It has always been about the prophecy and the prophecy child, even he said he had something greater in mind when he was originally writing Darth Vader and then he wrote the prequel trilogoy that answered what that was. All this final trilogy is doing is truly finishing the Anakin storyline that has existed (albeit mainly only ever eluded to and hinted at through select lines in the movies) always, and bring an end to the prophecy. What is happening is the ending of that prophecy, it wasn't fulfilled when Anakin became Vader and it wasn't fulfilled when Luke brought him back to being Anakin. Neither of those things actually brought balance to the force they simply shifted it from 'good' to 'bad' and back to 'good'. What the force is trying to do is sort of make a restart and get people to instead of following their own whims and using the force for themselves. But to follow the force and what it guides them to do and not in terms of living species definitions of 'good' and 'bad. That is what everything has been about. That is why the force brought an end to the Jedi Order in 'Revenge of the Sith'. Because as people have critiqued, the Jedi weren't really following the Jedi code and before The Clone Wars ever started they became to involved with politics and began using the force for their own whims instead of paying attention to what it wanted. That is why through Qui-Gon Jin, someone who actually followed the direction of the force (which led him to be named a Grey Jedi and is why he had trouble with and was never put on the Jedi Council) and Anakin, it acted. It's a God ( in a sense, it's not really a God its more like Dao mashed with some other things) without a physical form, so this is how it interacts. Through the mitochlorians. So this whole trilogy is being used, and really especially this last movie, to bring an end to the Skywalker saga and the prophecy about Anakin. So in some form he will act in this movie to cause the balance to be brought to the force. Hence, The Last Jedi title, which is referencing that Rey will be the last force-sensitive to be trained in the ways of the Jedi, because inherently it is flawed- in a much more subtle manner than the Sith. And while there are two sides to the force (Light and Dark, that is undeniable, it is canon and they actually have manifestations) the light is inherently more powerful and this is its grand scheme (literally tricking and manipulating the Dark side, through Darth Sidious, whom it is canon used the force to impregnate Anakin's mother) to regain control and balance so that the sides are no longer in conflict with each other, through some sort of resolution between the two faces of the force. And that is my explanation as to why they had clips from the other movies. I mean it is also a little about milking money and that's why they chose to bring Anakin's story to light more through the trailer, but Disney did it with story intentions in mind with the story also making them do it. But its mainly what I said. The trilogy could have been done better, like filling in some holes that are explained in the greater canon universe and explaining more things in general, because that would have helped with all of this. But when it comes down to it, you need to spend hours late at night scrolling through different Star Wars analyses and theories on your phone not sleeping and also watch the movies a ton and constantly as well as the different tv shows and watch videos explaining the canon comics and books, because what else are you going to do at night other than avoid sleep by scrolling through youtube until two in the morning. Definitely the prequels and sequels biggest flaws are their utter lack of explanation of the greater story arc taking place. And that is most likely most do to George Lucas, because he wants things very much his way, and gets stressed out like real bad when they don't go his way, so he probably very much made sure it was exactly to his specifications (the level of an extremely accomplished critical thinker, writer, and creative everything, leading to him to be eccentric in his writing and making things much to convoluded for people to just understand like he does because somewhere in his mind he expects us all to just understand what he is doing even though we need like hours and hours of work to try and piece his crap together).
