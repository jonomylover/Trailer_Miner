I love the hunger games and I love all 3 books even though the ending is rough but it's so political it makes it good at the same time.  And if your read the books you would understand why they decided to split the 3rd book into two movies.  There's so many things that are important in the book that they have to show.  2 hours does not serve justice for a book that has so much happen to make the story.  If you like the movies read the books.  I saw the first movie and read the book after fell in love and I continue to read.

2014-09-15T20:46:54,"This is definitely not the movie I pictured them making. Coming from someone who's read all the books and seen Gary Ross' The Hunger Games and Francis Lawrence's Catching Fire, this looks like a completely different take on the series, but it looks good! Gotta give props to Francis Lawrence and his team for making Catching Fire a great movie and I can't wait to see what they do with Mockingjay! I know a lot of people didn't like Mockingjay, the book, but in this case, I'm actually hoping the movie will ironically be BETTER than the book, considering they're splitting it into two parts, that will allow for more detail to be put into the movies, as well as add aspects to the movies that weren't in the book. For example, having Effie in District 13. She was never in District 13 in the book. She remained in the Capitol, possibly being held captive like Peeta. Katniss never knows for sure. I like things like that. They spice up the series and add new things. Even new characters, such as Robert Knepper's Antonius, who, much like Seneca Crane and Plutarch Hevensbee, is President Snow's right-hand-man. I'm looking forward to this interesting take on the books and wish Lionsgate best of luck on the final two movies in the trilogy.",1,0,Gun Good Gaming,C_Tsj_wTJkQ,0.35514354066985654,2014-09-15 20:46:54,True,True

I almost don't want to re read the book before the movie comes out just because I didn't like the book anyways. Catching Fire was great, my favorite. I'm glad they're making a certain change, a change to something that greatly disappointed me in the book. Also, people below bitching about spoilers, we're not going to withhold spoilers from you, people are bond to accidentally spill them when discussing aspects of the book. If you get spoiled, it's your own fault, honestly, looking at a freaking comment section isn't the best idea.

Every movie has a point and sometimes movies are crappy because they can't get their points across that well. This movie obviously is clear as day. This movie is actually really good. The storyline is phenomenal, the point is amazing. The plot is so much better than most. Honestly this was a well-written book. But the end of the book was kind of going a little too fast. I think that some things ended the wrong way. But this book was created by someone's imagination. This book was made to show you how life is. It's hard and you have to risk for those you love. Sometimes you have to be a leader too. I'm sure the movies I think are stupid like Lord Of The Rings and all that have a point too. It's just not something everyone is going to be interested in. Stop fighting about how stupid this movie is and how Lord Of The Rings is so much better. And just because you watch either doesn't make you retarded, it makes you someone who enjoys a god damn movie. Oh and that's all these are.. MOVIES. But they have good points to them.

He took your place, he paid your sin debt in full. He was buried  three days in a tomb. God raised him on the third day in victory.   Jesus conquered death, Satan and sin by the cross. Jesus is alive! He is returning! Be ready. Receive by faith this free gift. Go to God, talk to him, he is waiting for you. Tell him that you come to him as a sinner and receive, by faith, salvation through his Son Jesus. You immediately become a child of God. You are placed into the body of Christ.

This will be just as amazing as Catching Fire. The only thing I don't understand is, why is there going to be two movies? I think they are going to run out of events and have to stray away from the books which would be disappointing, but FL always has a way of making things work. I love how they showed Effie's rebellion by taking off the capital clothes. I hope it shows her real hair in the movie. I wonder who's going to die in which movie. I know they can't kill Fin-Fin or Little Duck now because that would basically be the end, but who knows. I also wonder how the scenes with Phillip Seymour Hoffman will turn out. Rip <3. I am really excited. Also really glad that they kept the bow and arrow as her true weapon. Most directors wouldn't understand how important that is and just throw her a gun. God bless JLAW. To anybody that calls her a whore/slut/ect.... I will cut you. The girl deserves more respect than anybody on this planet.

2014-10-10T19:37:44,"Io non credo che questo film possa riuscire, poiché il libro é un capolavoro soprattutto per le scene riflessive di katniss le quali in un film non possono essere espresse se non da dialoghi( che non hanno lo stesso effetto e non sempre sono possibili). Il libro é un vero e proprio capolavoro, i primi due capitoli sono solo un introduzione, qualcosa di relativamente insignificante, sono libri leggeri da ""una settimana e via"" il terzo é il capolavoro, é qualcosa di magnifico e complesso, secondo me una critica a una società che vuole farti credere di essere la migliore o di poter cambiare le cose in meglio mentre in realtà é solo finzione, cambia solo chi la controlla; sono appunto le riflessioni a trasmetterti un senso di cercare di andare avanti, continuare, resistere, anche quando tutto ti é avverso quando le persone care non sono più con te, quando non trovi più ragioni di vita ma cerchi di andare avanti lo stesso verso un delirio sconosciuto senza aiuti non sapendo dove sia il bene e dove sia il male poiché sembra che il male sia ovunque, a volte nei tuoi nemici a volte in chi ti ha aiutato non riuscendo a capire, a decidere, andare avanti sapendo solo che si sta andando avanti, andare avanti volendo andare avanti ma anche volendo fermarsi e tornare indietro, andare avanti. Questo libro é un capolavoro e dicendo ciò lo sto solo minimizzando. Questo libro é di quelli che ti fanno dire vedendo a che punto sei, no, il libro sta già finendo, dovrò chiuderlo e la storia finirà così presto! Ma anche come sarà il finale manca ancora molto al finale spero di arrivarci presto!

And for those who think this is all about romance you clearly haven't been paying attention to the movies. If you want romance, go watch Twilight, it's full of romance (romance movies suck in my opinion). The point of The Hunger Games is that the government is all screwed up. The reason they created the Capitol was because of a war, it wasn't created for no reason. It was made so they could have control over the people so they wouldn't run around crazy. If you HAD read Mockingjay you should know that the actual name is Panem, short for 'Panem de circus'. They created the Hunger Games for entertainment for those who live in the Capitol. You had a year to read the trilogy and you decided not to. Go read it if you haven't because you obviously don't pay attention to the trilogy a lot o.o  And no, don't come telling me that I went overboard because I know I did, and I have a purpose. :)",0,0,kuro,C_Tsj_wTJkQ,0.03482396509740259,2014-11-02 19:40:28,True,True

2014-11-22T15:40:45,"SPOILERS, I guess.  SO, I saw the movie yesterday.   TO BE HONEST: It was not a dynamic as I would have liked, as many people say, too, but in order to defend, Jennifer, Josh, Sam and Julianne's acting, (and some of the other actors too, EXCEPT FOR LIAM HEMSWORTH, but I'll get on that later,) the book wasn't much of a thriller action novel either. But luckily, the phenomenal acting and directions from Francis Lawrence, this movie is still better than the book for me. Mow, onto the full review;   THINGS I LOVED: First and foremost, slow clap for including the Avox. Wow. Whoa. Bravo. Good job. Wow. I was so happy they did that, because I used to be angry they never mentioned them in the Hunger Games or Catching Fire movies. And it was so flawlessly put in this movie that just...wow. Feels.  Also, District 13 was bad-ass. I mean, it was really impressive. Very well done. Then we have Julianne fucking Moore. Just...just...wow. This woman has AMAZING acting skills, and she was literally perfect for his role. Like, I actually LIKED her character, and I don't know if it's because of the acting, or because they changed her personality a bit, but still amazing job. I actually AGREED with Coin in the movie. She understood the bigger picture, and understood how she needs to protect her own people before anything else. Amazing.  Then, we have Finick Odair. MY BABY. Sam Cafflin did an amazing job portraying him. Ten billion stars to him. Wow. Also, that scene he has when he's trying to distract the Capitol and they're streaming him live while he tells the secrets he knows. LOVED IT. On a non-Finnick note, I also loved the brief scene where Snow's granddaughter or whatever undo-s her braid after Snow states that anyone carrying ANY symbol of the Mockingjay will be killed. Spot-on. Also, I loved how after th eattack, all the roses that covered the ground of District 13.  AND TO FINNISH OF ABOUT THE THINGS I LOVED CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT PEETA AND THE WAR AND THE REBELS. WOW. Whilst reading the book, I did NOT picture things like that. I pictured them in a much more boring way. Peeta wan't describe well enough to prepare me for what I saw. Neither was Joanna. But anyway, let's talk about Peeta first.  WOW. Just...flawless. That scene where he finally gets back and Katniss runs to see him and he's there, with his back to her, and then he turns, and his face is the scariest thing you have ever seen in your whole life. It's not scary in the oh-monsters-crap scary. No, it's scary in the FUCKING NO way. We see how broken he is, beyond any repair, beyond help. His face is all bruised up but that's not even  scary part. The scary part is that his skin is fucking glued ti his bones, and his eyes are SO EMPTY and his his neck dissapears into his shirt because he's SO thin and beaten up. And then he sees Katniss and he jumps on her and even though I knew what was going to happen, I FUCKING SCREAMED. Like, actually screamed. It was so fucking terrifying. Like you actually felt his pain and his anger and it fucking hurt. AND THEN THAT LAST SCENE WHERE KATNISS WALKS TO WHERE HE""S TIED DOWN IN A AM EMPTY WHITE ROOM ON A BED AND HE'S FUCKING SCREAMING HIS HEART OUT AND THAT JUST RIPS YOUR HEART AND STOPS ON IT BECAUSE HOW DARE THEY TIE HIM UP AFTER HE WAS KEPT THAT WAY AND TORTURED FOR SO LON.   AND THE HANGING TREE SONG AND THE BLOW UP OF THE DAM. THAT WAS EPIC AND AMAZING AND I'SM SORRY BUT EVERYONE IS BRAVER THAN KATNISS IN THIS MOVIE IDK.   Things I didn't like: Liam Hemsworth. ",1,0,bellathorneanzendaya,C_Tsj_wTJkQ,0.09117855383099283,2014-11-22 15:40:45,False,True

At the end of the day; it's children killing each other as entertainment for the capitol as they fight for food for their district. I just think it should've been made a little more adult as the story is very dark, bloody and disturbing. But i still love the films; they've done a very classy take on the books. Just wish they'd done it as brutal and raw as the books are. And i also think they've portrayed coin a little too nice  [spoiler for those who haven't read the books]  because she's a total bitch in the book and that's why it was kind of a good thing when katniss kills her. If they kill her like this i'll probably be like 'awwwh' because she's alright in this film. I hope they change her a little in the next one.

This heroine is supposed to be 16-year-old girl, not 25. Especially in CF she looks beautiful/weird/original in the fancy clothes she is told to wear, but hey!, even in scenes, where she ought to be ""natural"" with no make-up on Katniss face doesn't make me feel like she is my age(yup, 16). Imagine the movie(it's easy if you try ;) with an actual 16-year-old Jen(there are some pics of hers and Josh's at this age) who are forced to get married, lie about pregnancy(the reaction of the crowd is not because of her age, imho), being forced to take place in The Hunger Games. Imagine their sacrifice as being still kids. Imagine how mature they are, because of the world they live in. Imagine the whole story this way, with younger-looking Katniss and Peeta, as well. Does it make more thrighten? And Peeta, his hijacking, only 17. Later they take part in the war and are only one year older. Not young adults, still teenagers. The movie doesn't make me feel this way. Even though there perfect special effects, even though Jen is super beautiful and many others it doesn't stick to the main target of Suzanne Collins'. Youth. Innocence. All taken away because of entertaiment-desire. And btw, if you're still reading, doesn't it(what I'm talking about, Jen's age) make you feel, like we cannot bear looking at children fighting? That we prefer perfect- looking young adults, which are no longer children to look at in TV, etc.? Isn't it the thing Capitol has been doing to the tributes? MAking them beamingly beautiful, just to make them look older? Would they stomach this?  I'm really asking in the last questions, just a thought.

You have to take a step back and think where did the story start and how it could end. It always the movie before the last final movie that will have the least action. They wanna spend less in budget so the could dump the most into the final epic finale also they need to explain and set the stage for the next movie.
