It took a few minutes to identify (just because it's a live action production), but I was a fan of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh--and apparently so was everyone else. When I said, ""That's Piglet!"" The room erupted with ""Oh yeah!"" and such a sense of delight.

2018-05-27T06:21:12,"I honestly don't want to see this film, not because it doesn't look good, but because I'm not sure how many live action ""down to earth"" representations of classic children's properties I can take. For example, I would have to say that ""Saving Mr. Banks"" was a great film and Tom Hanks did an awesome Job as Walt Disney. But I would be lying to myself if I said that I didn't come out of that movie super depressed considering the way they depicted the real family of the author. And I would say the same for that one movie about the author of Peter Pan (I forget it's name) and the more recent representation of Winnie the Pooh ""Goodbye Christopher Robin"". Which I also thought was a great film. And I appreciated how they portrayed the characters in that film. But again, the super dark tones of this war torn father who struggles with depression and almost strangles his son in one scene, really made it so that I can't appreciate the original without associating it with this dark imagery. And I'm just not sure if I want to watch another live action take on a beloved children's property that depicts the harshness of reality, to only shoehorn in some hand fisted moral at the end. Again, I'm not saying that those movies are inherently bad, but I just wish we'd get some new creative films that kids can adore too. But Disney especially seems set on taking their older properties and turning them into gritty live action films.",0,0,John Moser,0URpDxIjZrQ,0.20180274971941636,2018-05-27 06:21:12,True,True

Me encanta el hecho de lo envejecidos y abandonados que se ven algunos de los personajes al haber pasado los a√±os, pero creo que hay algunos que se los podr√≠an haber currado mucho. Creo que la pel√≠cula va a ser un drama en general que provocar√° la llorera de todos los integrantes del cine y no hubiera apostado por ello pues si yo recuerdo algo de Winnie the Pooh y mi infancia es el hecho de que me hac√≠an re√≠r con todo, de cantar, so√±ar o bailar por muy raritos que fu√©ramos.

2018-05-27T15:33:40,"Number 15: Burger king foot lettuce. The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: ""This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King."" Admittedly, he had shoes on. But that's even worse.  The post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfleld Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's ""Tell us about us"" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said ""Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired."" Mystery solved, by 4chan.

That was when he started seeing Pooh and his friends again. Later on in the film, Christopher learned that his daughter inherited the illness.The moral of the story is don't trust Big Pharm.

2018-05-28T07:14:06,*cries* I'm just happy the majority of the voices returned. I would be upset if they replaced the character voices with celebrities or something random. Also this seems really promising. The idea that Robin has to return to his past childhood friends in order to see what is missing seems like a wonderful idea. I think my only complaint is the cgi look of the characters. I'm not sure if I like that toy looking quality to them. I also think it would be nice if their colors were brighter to be more like the later adaption style of Winnie the Pooh and not so much the book illustration. Unless they plan to go from muted colors to brighter colors as the story progresses and Robin begins to change. Then I wouldn't mind that.,0,0,Sammich,0URpDxIjZrQ,0.13846153846153847,2018-05-28 07:14:06,True,True

(John 5:14).  ***When you commit sin and you don't confess and forsake them, you open yourself up to Demonic entities/forces. Like adultery, alcoholism, fornication, lust etc. This is the reason why Jesus said in John 14:15, ""If you love me keep my commandments.""  ***(Jesus): As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. (Revelation 3:19).  ***Jesus uses demonic forces to rebuke and chasten us so that we REPENT....  *** (REPENTANCE)*** (Greek. Metanoia); Strong's #3341; This Greek word is a compound word derived from meta, meaning ""after"" and suggesting some type of change, and nous, meaning ""mind.""  Thus the word strictly denotes ""a change of mind."" But it also connotes remorse for sin, accompanied by a desire to turn away from one's sin, to God, for salvation. Both John the Baptist and Jesus began their ministries with a call to repentance. (See Matthew 3:2, 4:17)---A call that many of the social outcasts and ""sinners"" of that day answered, (See Luke 19:1-10), but that the religious people rejected.

I don't know what to make of this. I too am a virgin, but I'm barely old enough to have a toddler or an infant child, let alone two or more. However, if I did have kids, I probably would let them watch Winnie the Pooh as I'm not an authoritarian and heavily value personal freedom and civil liberty, especially when it comes to religion despite what the author of this article believes. There's other fat virgins who shouldn't be idolized.

2018-06-06T16:17:30,I have watched mostly every single movie of my childhood that has came from either stories or just the fact that Legends were told from books. Out of all of them I have been waiting for Winnie the Pooh to get a live-action movie because after finding out that Christopher Robin in real life gave up on his old childhood friend it truly broke my heart but looking at this makes me feel like this movie might give Christopher Robin some closure and maybe even from feels from people who knew him even if they were young or even if they were too small to understand what he was about..... I believe that in heaven Christopher Robin might think that Winnie the Pooh might have been still the thing that ruined his life but I hope that after he feels how many people love what he has brought us from the children that have been born watching Winnie the Pooh or have a stuffed animal of his..... To the children that will go up to watch the videos of Winnie the Pooh or even be read to sleep from his father's work..... He will understand how much people can relate to him and see that Winnie the Pooh will always be a friend of his and a friend of Millions.,43,2,Deshi Rokkawa,0URpDxIjZrQ,0.1976190476190476,2018-06-06 16:17:30,True,True

Imagine if the whole movie took place in the hundred acre wood. Maybe time has changed it. Perhaps it was sold or tore down, and talking to his once beloved friends is a means to cope and accept change while also knowing that his childhood and the good times will be forever remembered. It would ten times more emotional that way, but by the looks of it Pooh is interacting with other characters making them seem like real life people.

While I agree that it can be harmful in large doses, honestly, what really matters to me is just making sure that when my children do watch TV, they‚Äôre watching shows that impart some sort of positive value into their lives. This also means steering them away from programs that might affect them negatively, which is why I never allow my children to watch anything featuring Winnie the Pooh, the fat virgin.  If you‚Äôre unfamiliar, Winnie the Pooh is a brainless bear who lives in the forest and slowly makes the world bad. He has beady serpent eyes and zero genitals, which is something we know because he never wears any pants or undergarments. In fact, he‚Äôs practically bragging about not having a penis. But even if he did have a penis, he wouldn‚Äôt know it, because his fat belly would keep him from seeing anything below his sad bear tits. It makes me mad just thinking about it. This bear, he just wanders around eating honey out of a jar with his bare hands like a fat savage. I hate it.  One thing that can be assumed about the dickless sad sack called Winnie the Pooh is that he is a virgin. He clearly has never fucked. He is a simpering, high-voiced virgin who spends all his time leering at a little boy named Christopher. It‚Äôs disgusting. I don‚Äôt want my kids being exposed to that. I‚Äôm not going to be like, ‚ÄúHey, kids, come watch the emasculated bear with the scary fingerless hands who‚Äôs never fucked a day in his life and who is obsessed with a little boy of a different species.‚Äù That‚Äôd be irresponsible and gross.  For those who are unfamiliar with Winnie the Pooh, he is a simpering, high-voiced virgin who spends all his time leering at a little boy named Christopher.   ‚ÄúBut what do you let your kids watch?‚Äù you might ask. I‚Äôd much rather my kids watch the fuck machine named Big Bird. Big Bird is the towering human bird from PBS who you can tell is just constantly fucking. He‚Äôs got that swagger. There are a lot of good lessons children can learn from a major-league pussy-crusher like Big Bird, such as the importance of confidence, courage, and friendship.  Winnie the Pooh, on the other hand, wouldn‚Äôt know the first thing about courage. If he were on United Airlines Flight 93, for example, not only would he have not joined the revolt against the terrorists, but he probably would‚Äôve gotten down on his yellow knees and sucked the terrorists‚Äô cocks one by one. ‚ÄúOh, bother!‚Äù he would shrug as the al-Qaeda operatives drilled the back of his throat with their pube-slathered ding-dongs.  What a coward, this pathetic bear.  I cannot fathom how any parent could ever willingly expose their children to trash like Winnie the Pooh. It seems like a guaranteed recipe to ensure that your kids grow up to be pitiful, dead-eyed perverts who will never know the heavenly joys of fucking. If you want your kids to grow up to be brave and smart, you should let them watch either the impressive sex duck Big Bird, the cunning potato named Arthur, or Babar the indoor elephant. Winnie the Pooh is a walking disease, and if I ever catch my kids watching him, I will spank them with my belt. And if you‚Äôre a good parent, you will do the same.",0,0,mkevz,0URpDxIjZrQ,-0.05229002856553875,2018-06-13 06:09:08,True,True

So please. if your considering going to this , but you read some critic , that most likely needs a laxative from a hard life , review , take into consideration the impact  Winnie The Pooh had on you when you were a kid.  Heck the movie , Christopher Robin , brought me back in such a wonderful way , that I remembered the book *The Te of Piglet* by _Benjamin Hoff_  That was back when I decided , or life decided for me, that change was needed .  I would practice stretching and breathing and think of all the zen like things Pooh would say .   During the whole time I was watching Christopher Robin my spirit was smiling toes to fingertips . So don't listen to those who only want to say negative things about a heart warming experience you can have with your children.

There is the character _Madeline_ ,  and  _"" Your life is happening now, right in front of you ""_  Here's a song from my childhood that I loved and still do.

This movie has the charm of a Winnie The Pooh and Ewan McGregor is excellent as Christopher Robin, the whole cast was great and to have Jim Cummings do the voice of Pooh and Tigger was great. This is a great family film and anybody who is a Pooh fan will love this movie and who doesn't really know the character will fall in love with it. The CGI is great in this movie and I like how they make Pooh and his friends look like stuffed animals and there is some reference to The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh in this movie spoiler like the scene where Christopher and Pooh throw sticks in the river off the bridge and some other recognizable stuff. The acting, story, and directing is great in this movie. This is a well-made film and hopefully, it gets the praise it deserves. And what would a Winnie The Pooh movie be without the Tigger song and the Winnie The Pooh song? I would have been a little disappointed if those songs were not in the movie would it make it worse, no but it is icing on the cake. P.S. Bronte Carmichael was terrific as Madeline Robin, Christopher's daughter. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do.

And Pooh represents the wisdom that comes with childhood, because he has a lot of innocence, he is optimistic, and quite imaginative, and, thanms to that, he never forgets what is really important yet he gets what he eants, and shates it with others, he manages to see a light in every darkness, and best of all, he's always happy thanks to that. And with that imagination, optimism, and innocence, we could destroy all the hate and fear that is destroying our world, and maybe even destroying them from history, as if hate and fear never existed.

And tv shows like the new adventures of Winnie Pooh and My friends Tigger and Pooh i guess so.   The first time i saw the film in theathers was emotional,i think is similar like Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland(2010)   in my opinion Alice in Wonderland 2010 i think is the second part of disney animated film,well because  Alice and Christopher Robin they similar about childhood   In first place Alice was little girl who visit in Wonderland,last time in animated film when Alice wakes up everything disappear,but when she grown up she return to Wonderland to reunite with the white rabbit,the dormouse,march hare,the cheshire cat,Tweddledee and Tweddledum,the blue caterpilar(also Absolem), Mad Hatter and more. In the final battle when Alice fight with a dragon called Jabberwocky and stops the Queen of Hearts/Red Queen the new characters doesn't appears in Disney animated film are Mirana the White Queen(Queen of Hearts's sisters),the bloodhount(dog),an hybrid-like-snow leopard called the Bandersnatch,an giant bird like a vulture and the guy with patch in the eye(Stayne). the place Wonderland some animals looks like CGI films about dinosaurs,dragons and animals,it looks like Narnia,that was the best Tim Burton's disney adpation films.   In the second place Christopher Robin was a little boy who visits  the Hundred Acre Wood,is when Christopher he forgots all sense of imagination just like Alice. But now Christopher Robin reunites with Pooh and return to the Hundred Acre Wood to reunite with PIglet,Eeyore,Tigger,Kanga,Rabbit,Owl and Roo. In the scene when he return to the Hundred Acre Wood, is similar like Alice in Wonderland for example the tunnel of White Rabbit. When Christopher Robin through in the tree,the tree is the entrance of Hundred acre Wood very similar like down. when i saw the film in final scene is when Christopher Robin,Pooh bear,Madeline,Evelyn,Tigger,Eeyore,Piglet and the works of Winslow to stoped Giles. In scene Christopher Robin he called Woozle to her boss that was funny Christopher Robin that was the best film and beautiful,and emotional same songs and new songs by Richard Sherman and the best film of Marc Forster after Finding Neverland   I think Alice and Christopher Robin have a inner child, growing up doesn't you can leave your childhhood behind some grownups decided about inner child and grown ups things,some grown ups have memories about childhood and her imagination",0,0,Mario D Soberanis,0URpDxIjZrQ,0.12383838383838383,2019-12-17 02:42:57,False,False

Childhood is human nature.  We learn to play and we see the world as a beautiful, fascinating, wonderous thing.
