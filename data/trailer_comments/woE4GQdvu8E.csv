That's not the case and he's an asshole besides but every once in a while he strikes gold. Been a while, too. His sci fi flicks may have been decent but they weren't bank, and this one won't be either but at least he has some funny lines and the story literally drips from the eaves.

2018-01-15T08:05:02,"ONE DAY THE WORLD WILL KNOW THAT THE CONTRAS WERE NOT DRUG SMUGGLERS OR DRUG TRAFFICKERS OR DRUG USERS, OR CRIMINALS. Their story of valor, love of their country, and courage will be told. Their story will come to light when enough people, not media outlets or university text books stop spewing their attempt at whitewashing history or spwing plain lies. ‚ÄúGive light, and the darkness will disappear of itself‚Äù Desiderius Erasmus.   The criminals were all along on the side of those who the ‚Äúfreedom fighters or Contras"" were fighting against. Some of their enemies were in the very US Congress and their international criminal element allies...   I just watched the movie ""American Made"". It is imperative that anyone who watches this movie also watches the video below. But you can also find a lot of material that social media and others have attempted to bury out.  I'm most gracious to this video, because at minute 17+ he says how they stirred up the confusion between arms supplied to leftist rebels and that were not for the Contras. Something the world needs to know...NO CONTRA WAS EVER GOING TO BE ALIVE IF THEY EVER STEPPED FOOT IN MANAGUA, WHEN THEY WERE FIGHTING THE VERY PEOPLE IN MANAGUA. Somthing most people don't know is that during the late 1970's and the Sandinista's reign of terror in the country, nobody was allowed to freely travel from city to city. You had to get a pass from the CDS and the chiefs of police, army, and the equivalent of Gestapo.   https://youtu.be/gLWMnH31D-Y  American Made is as far from the truth as it gets, even if its premise is correct in that it is as American made as they come (American government establishment - G. Bush senior, one of those who played double face to Ronald Reagan) part of the deep state! The movie is picture perfect of what I will call, ‚Äúquintessential FBI, CIA, and its Hollywood minions ""disinformation, propaganda, diversion‚Äù, throw the charge at the ceiling and walls and see it stick. Experience they gained from Hitler, Stalin, Castro, and yes, WWII's FDR and others.   In the white-water Senate hearings, see how at around minute 30 Dan Lasater is splitting hairs on his guilty conviction for conspiracy to distribute narcotics. (Interesting factoid, how many years did he serve in jail and who gave him a pardon? ÔÅä you couldn‚Äôt make this shit up) ‚Ä¶ Lasater‚Äôs hair splitting ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Ä¶Sounds familiar? ""Bengasi, I didn't delete emails were not criminal, they were 'extremely careless‚Äô, I whipped clean the server with a cloth, and the best from these cute couple, overload, ""I did not have sex with that woman"".   One day the world will know that the peasants ""contras"" were not the drug smugglers, that they recovered mostly all their weapons from Sandinista bases they overran/defeated in battles, and from a large infusion from our world champion Alexis Arguello, who gave them over 30 million dollars to fight against all the international criminals who were behind the Sandinistas at the time. Alexi's first shipments arrived in and around 1982, right around his first fight with Aaron Pryor...in which I was almost expelled from the boarding school I was attending at the time, near Matagalpa, Nicaragua, for been out of the campus, outside the holly Shabbat's and school‚Äôs rules for decorum, watching the fight. :-)  Another important factoid is the fact that during the so called ""Contra drug smuggling hearings that Congress, in the House (now disgraced and retired congressman Charles Rangel, and in the Senate then Sen. John Kerry) were the ultimate diversioneers, in order to cover their tracks, and masters of the now we know to be corrupt, criminal I'd say, FBI, CIA, and the minions who almost brought down President Reagan, all on trumped up charges that are far from the truth. Because both were managed by the very people supporting the Sandinistas and leftist guerrillas throughout Latin America.",0,0,Manny Artola,woE4GQdvu8E,0.12645743145743146,2018-01-15 08:05:02,False,False
