Take advantage of yours and let others do the same with theirs. As far as we know, the ones we live, are the only ones we've got. All that's relevant, right now. So, focus on living it how you choose and PERFER. That's the point of being born with free will, reguardless of what others try to convence you of doing with your life.

Simon on the other hand, was thought to be straight for a while and people expected him to be, and he didn't even come out on his own terms- he was exposed by screenshots of his emails with Blue, his lover. So yes, the movie is self aware that coming out is a situation where nobody cares most of the time, but for Simon he had close friends and family that already made up their minds about his sexuality. He had a different situation where he didn't even get to come out on his own terms- thus leading him to do desperate things to hide his secret and hurts his friends along the way.

Either you have never seen any other quality movies (The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption ,  Schindler's List, Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,  Lawrence of Arabia, The Sound of Music, West Side Story, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, 2001: A Space Odyssey, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Singin' in the Rain, It's a Wonderful Life, Some Like It Hot, Ben-Hur, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Gladiator, Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Rocky, To Kill a Mockingbird, A Clockwork Orange, Doctor Zhivago, Jaws,  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Platoon, Braveheart, Dances with Wolves, Jurassic Park, Goodfellas, The French Connection, City Lights, It Happened One Night, Rain Man,  The Grapes of Wrath, The Green Mile, American Graffiti, Pulp Fiction,  Good Will Hunting, and the list from the book of all great films goes on and on SO CHECK YOUR FACTS before making a wild claim like ""best movie ever"" AS THAT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE SOMEONE FROM A FILM STUDIO OR MARKETING AGENCY who's interpretation of ""ever"" is the last five minutes, SO you either work for the studio/marketing company that produced this film. I checked several other books, reference, IMDB and i would find it hard pressed to state that this is the best film this week, as there were much bigger and more meaningful films that came out that very same week, month and this year. Thus if you want to CONTINUE TO MISLEAD PEOPLE then carry on, but if you want PEOPLE TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY, THEN AT LEAST DO 10-15 MINUTES OF BASIC RESEARCH, OR STATE THAT ""IN YOUR OPINION, THIS IS THE BEST FILM EVER""!!! As for groundbreaking films of the late 20th and early 21st century you have films like ""Swordfish"" and ""The Matrix"" both of which revolutionized the way scenes are filmed with ""full 360 view"" and ""Bullet-Time"", then you have films like Titanic, Avatar, and others that not only learned from these films but added story, visual, audio and other value to the viewer, this film.....not even in the ballpark, heck its not even a person sitting in their car in the parking lot of the ballpark, its just a teenage, ""movie-of-the-moment"" with a dash of liberal propaganda.

2018-08-10T22:31:30,I watched this movie during a 14 hour plane ride and cried the entire time so I ended up rewatching it 3 more times in those 14 hours. I'm not part of the LGBTQ+ community but this movie connects to everyone no matter who you are. This movie has so many important and inspiring messages that need to have more focus on them. This is just the start to hopefully a society of acceptance and empowering human beings. Thank you to the writers and 20th Century Fox for bring this movie into my and so many other peoples lives.,514,7,avery watts,E0cbWdlQg_8,0.27749999999999997,2018-08-10 22:31:30,False,False

2018-08-13T05:37:07,"I was in love with this movie for the most part. It captured a lot of what I felt as a teen in high school, all the ups and downs and anxieties and sorrows etc. But what I disliked mainly comes down to firstly Martin, not simply because he's a big issue for the protagonist, but because he is that way primarily because he's so unrealistically delusional and oblivious, even for a teenager. I mean honestly, I feel like he was a cartoon character that materialized solely to make life harder for Simon. I would have preferred a more believable source of antagonism if I'm being honest.  Secondly, the publicity given to the union of the two love interests. I'd just like to say first that I called that reveal halfway through, and I was SOOOO here for it, cause he was cute AF and he was so heavily focused on. Jumped outta my seat in glee when he arrived. But anyway, the Ferris Wheel publicity; do not support that at all. Because essentially, Blue is given the ultimatum of outing himself to everyone if he even wants to speak with Simon that night. As much I wanted their meeting, I would not have blamed him if he didn't want the entire freaking school as an audience for his coming out, and just didn't show up. And the fact that their moment wasn't really even private? Free to be recorded and spread around yet again? Had Blue not arrived, Simon's rejection would have been a public sob story. I wouldn't even approve of this for a straight couple, let alone these guys. Moments like these can get pretty personal or sensitive. Audiences are for weddings. Simon's got balls, and a fair bit of strength all things considered, but he could use a bit more tact.  But beyond that, I loved the movie.

2018-09-08T17:57:02,"This movie brought out so many emotions in me, but I know I couldn't come out to anyone (only anonymously like now)..I don't have a perfect family - my mom raised me alone and my dad... He pops up now and then but I don't see him as my dad at all. I wouldn't tell him anyway, as he plays no role in my life. My mom... I think she might have a hunch, but I'm too scared to hurt her so I keep it all to myself. My siblings are more open minded and probably would support me, but I'm too big of a chicken to tell them   It's hard for me to go out and do stuff, I always feel so confused and uncomfortable in most social scenes. I can't open up to anyone, because I've seen the awful things people do when they hear rumours or find out that you're homosexual... I still have hope that I'll find my place and finally be able to be free, to feel like you can actually tell everything you want, do whatever you wish... I'm still in high school and this is my last year, so I truly hope I find some place I can go after I graduate.  I know it's weird to write so intimate stuff about yourself in YouTube comments section, but after watching this movie I had to put my emotions somewhere and the only way I could do it is by doing it anonymously (hopefully no one knows I have this account... but what's the possibility of anyone stumbling onto this and knowing who I am.
