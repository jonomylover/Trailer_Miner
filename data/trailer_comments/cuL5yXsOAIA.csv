It was her primary trait in the books Jackson said ""It would be too distracting"" for fucks sakes thats why she wears the scarf all the time.   Its not about her being ""fucked up enough to be insecure but still bangable"" its about her entire face is destroyed.  Seriously every scene her face is seen in the book people comment on it and call her ugly and it IS her entire character. Its the thing that allows her to grow as a person. What she has now barely affects her looks, literally take 2 steps back and shes hot af. A big difference from missing her nose and having her face fucked.  The fact that Valentine could have done that to a child completely shatters Tom's perspective (well and being thrown out of the city)   I dont get why she has to be attractive to be believable. Hester being ugly is literally her entire character in the books. Something that she deals with and works past in a believable and realistic way but shit even her kids make fun of her for being ugly. Because shes ugly she is very mean, it hardly works when your face is barely harmed and you still are an easy 7. Hester had to cover her face or people were physically revolted. This chick most would still be attracted to easily.   *THIS IS THE REASON TOM IS THE BEST CHARACTER IS BECAUSE HE LEARNS TO LOVE HESTER ANYWAY.

Then there's the problem everyone's on about, which is that hester is supposed to be super ugly. This isn't just a ""but mah book!"" complaint, it's kinda one of the main themes of the book in that tom form's a relationship with hester not just based off looks, but because he sees that she has ""beauty"" in other ways. Part of growing closer to Hester is that tom starts to gradually become less enraptured with Katherine (Valentine's daughter), who is more classically beautiful, as he forms a stronger relationship with Hester.

Tom looks like he's not the perspective character here; so his development is cheapened. Katherine and Bevis haven't even been shown yet; who knows if they'll even impact the plot at all; so I can't depend on their character arc. Is there any character development left? 2 This trailer revealed like 90% of the secrets and dark parts of this world's reality that we learned gradually in the book. Is there any intrigue left? 3 the tension between the cast. Does Tom even matter in the movie? We don't even know his name from the trailers. It looks like its just gonna be action hero Hester and needy sidekick loverboy, with none of the main thematic clashes in their beliefs that made them an interesting duo in the first place. Will there be any interesting character chemistry at all?  I'm very worried that this adaptation is gonna get the same immensely disappointing treatment that The Hobbit did, but even worse since they're gonna feel super cautious about doing anything interesting with the main character since she's a woman and that's such a hot button issue.  Pessimistic AF so I won't be disappointed no matter what happens. Maybe I'll have the pleasant surprise of being proven totally and utterly wrong about everything.

She is perfectly relatable to all members of your audience with a minimally constructed personality allowing viewer expectations to fill in the gaps for themselves regardless of those gaps being a mile wide. Pre-made to have a revenge driven mindset that comes free with any of our four basic tragic backstory options. And for a limited time only get 20% off our 'chosen one power fantasy' package; allowing your protagonist to be a completely 'realistic' unstoppable force ordained by the writers themselves to defeat the villain despite insurmountable odds and even basic laws of physics working against her. Your custom-made rubber stamp female lead is sure to steal the hearts of every man aged 18 to 35 with disposable income, or whichever demographic your target is. And as a bonus, she will even get women into theatres to see your movie. Because, as we know, female representation in a lead character is all you really need to get women interested in your next film.   But of course, don‚Äôt forget that your heroine is woefully incomplete without a strong male character who falls into her life as if by fate, and that can take over for her whenever events become too much for even the strongest woman to handle. If you haven‚Äôt already found a man for her then make sure to ask for the ‚ÄòYoung Hunk of the day.‚Äô He‚Äôs guaranteed to be cute, handsome, come with abs, and is completely devoted to your main character despite her rough and unforgiving nature, crude outlook on life, and generally repulsive and selfish demeanor. His generic attractiveness, lack of personality and unnatural devotion is sure to satisfy any woman‚Äôs wish for the ideal man. Plus, his completely untested but amazing fighting skills are sure to wow any man with enough brains to question his love for the main character, while inspiring younger viewers to want to become cool just like him‚Äîand buy his action figure. But be careful to us him quickly, otherwise your hunk may spoil, and you will need to purchase a replacement. Luckily, lookalikes are stocked regularly at no additional cost.

Adaptation is all well and good but the part I think most of us (who read the books) have issue with is the scar. It sets her ENTIRE character because she‚Äôs supposed to be UGLY! Not some pretty girl with a bigger Harry Potter scar. It doesn‚Äôt really cover her face and I actually asked my English teacher about her bc he saw the movie and he didn‚Äôt even remember the scar. Her entire character is shunned to the side for the sake of pretty actress. This movie will go down excellently with people who haven‚Äôt read the books but it will forever be up on my list of failed movie adaptations. Good for you if you enjoyed it. But I can‚Äôt stand something that treads over a series I absolutely adore so much. It has one of my absolute favourite endings to a book series ever. Four excellent books. Watch the movie first then read the books if you wanna enjoy the movie.  A brief list of bad film adaptations: Eragon  I am number four Percy Jackson  All excellent books btw. Love each and every one. But the movies are just hot garbage.
