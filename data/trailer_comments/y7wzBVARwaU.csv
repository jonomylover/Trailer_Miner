Not too overly complicated, therefore easy to follow and interpret the storyline. The star of the show or shall I say the person that stole the show, has to be indeed Lewis Pullman's, Miles Milner.   Pullman's acting was strongly convincing, geniune, and full of quality. Not intentionally undermining the performance of the remaining cast, but Pullman for me gave this film the magic touch it needed through his performance (especially the ending), and you will also agree why I say this when you watch the movie.

It's dark, very violent, and a bit surreal. Rare to see a movie like this in modern times, where reboots of garbage are the norm. The cast took a pay cut to make this movie knowing it could be something above the typical junk that passes for movies these days. Per usual, Jeff Bridges is a scene stealer being a master of his craft. Quentin Tarantino could have made this film if he were a better director... The ending drags some and gets predictable and formulaic, but it does not ruin an otherwise strong movie.
