2016-12-10T17:05:27,"I've seen ""Nocturnal Animals"" and it was fantastic. This entire film talks about a beautiful artist who is reading her ex-husband's latest novel. Then, she reads about a fictional main character (who refers as her ex-husband) who was corrupted by these nasty rapists and harm his family while continues to deal against the man who sets it up. While she reads it, she was shock that everything else that her ex-husband was setting up as real connection between these two which can be real. I would say that these three performances like Adams, Gyllenhaal, and Shannon done a great job, if you they could get an Oscar. The film was so tense that while she reads the novel and she was expressing herself that her ex-boyfriend was telling in his own dark way of betrayal, scary, and too emotional about their lives. The scenes were very dark colorful that fades every scene with black and red. Some were few things that it's a little too much like that opening which is a weird art way and the middle part where thins are getting frightening that it gets a bit too cold. But at least I follow along and the ending never explained why, but you can make conclusions of what happened, but never mention about the twist. Overall a great film.

Amy, great..Armie, great..everyone did great, he just seemed to nonchalant about it..remember him retelling what happened?

2017-03-19T14:53:05,"It goes without saying: Tom Ford's poignant, and grim drama Nocturnal Animals is one of the most spiritual movies ever made. Not only does Nocturnal Animals revolve around a series of events that are disturbing, but the execution of the story is incredibly thoughtful, and yet ironically just logical. What makes Nocturnal Animals¬†particularly relevant, is that it's a case of the ability of logic being¬†the theme of the movie. More¬†precisely, Tom Ford's drama is about the war between the link between morality and reality's origin and the ability of that link. On the surface, Nocturnal Animals can come across as a nuanced story about revenge, and guilt, however, at a deeper level the film is an exploration of the immorality of empathy, because¬†for empathy to be valid that meant that empathy always needed to be a reaction to something valid (in this instance, the absurdity of logic being the deaths of Laura and India Hastings).¬†Regardless of the actual plot, an interpretation of Nocturnal Animals is that each of its events are part of a chain, and that the chain is an examination of the¬†identity of the moral perspective. Throughout the story,¬†characters react, and they have perspective. And while this in itself would seem a pointless thing to point out, because¬†of the uniformity relative to other stories and movies,¬†the uniformity is destroyed because of the sense that the perspectives and reactions throughout the film are in fact¬†counter-productive to the conventional morality of the movie's events.¬†Susan, played brilliantly by Amy Adams, and Gyllenhaal's Tony Hastings share a pattern of visual symmetry from start to finish,¬†while at the same time¬†both¬†being part of opposite realities as the intended theme seems the wrong interpretation: the self-awareness of Nocturnal Animals could be that its mission is to justify the isolation represented by Susan and Tony.¬†Susan's visceral reactions to the story of Tony¬†are moral, but not the¬†moral perspective. Of course, Susan's perspective on the story sent to her by Edward is the conventional morality, and thus the point of Nocturnal Animals is to understand the true¬†significance of reaction. The horror, and the gruesome events that define the life of Tony Hastings¬†need the capitalist lifestyle that Susan's life is defined by,¬†and yet oddly, the¬†intelligence of Nocturnal Animals is to understand that the capitalist system is the creator of¬†empathy - reality's symbiosis. And even within the context that capitalism as empathy's creator is an inevitable thus pointless understanding, somehow, Nocturnal Animals just plays so that its mission isn't pointless. The very iimage, the very moment of the discovery of the corpses of Laura and India is a perfect, root demonstration of the concept of conundrum. Fascinatingly, if the argument of Nocturnal Animals is that the moral perspective is synonymous with the concept of conundrum, the issue becomes how to perceive the individual chains throughout the movie. Again, perhaps this can be tied to the point about the inherent power of Nocturnal Animals simply being the impossibility of irrelevance. At heart, this movie is a masterful display of storytelling, the kind of movie that doesn't just put other movies to shame, but which actually makes¬†many other movies¬†immoral.",0,0,Thomas h cullen,juFmTNbFh8g,0.07551406926406928,2017-03-19 14:53:05,False,False

2019-10-14T16:34:02,"I think Nocturnal Animals is a masterpiece.  Not only the acting, but also the story in general.  Tom Ford is a master director in my opinion.  Everything from the lighting to the staging in the movie is amazingly well thought out.  Even if the story is tragic, it has something many people can relate to, such as lost opportunities or past regret from things done in the past and which resurface years later.  It would be wonderful if Tom Ford took on more film projects.  I find this an extremely good film.",0,0,Alpha Bravo,juFmTNbFh8g,0.16153846153846155,2019-10-14 16:34:02,False,False
