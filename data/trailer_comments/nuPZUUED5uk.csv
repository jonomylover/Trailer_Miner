Even if you didn't know that, a really quick google search of ""enigma code"" would tell you that. Stop being lazy. You'd watch a film about the Holocaust or 9/11 and not expect a plot twist, so why expect one from this movie? Just because to you ALan Turing is only one man and therefore how eciting can his story be? Again, a quick google search would show you that Turing was invaluable to winning the war and is the inventor of the very first computer. That's a massive achievement. He also committed suicide, dying horribly alone, chemically castrated because he was gay. That is a life worth telling a story about.  Second of all, those people saying they want excitment or ""storyline"" out of a movie, how they watch movies for the events, are all clearly forgetting that movies are made by the actors. The stories are told by the actors. A fabulous story with terrible actors falls flat, while a mediocre story told by great actors becomes a great film. I could watch a movie that I know the story of over and over if the characters are brought to life by exceptional actors. Benedict happens to be phenomenal, as do many of his co stars.

This success was a result of efforts by three Polish cryptologists, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski, working for Polish military intelligence. Rejewski ""reverse-engineered"" the device, using theoretical mathematics and material supplied by French military intelligence. Subsequently the three mathematicians designed mechanical devices for breaking Enigma ciphers, including the cryptologic bomb. From 1938 onwards, additional complexity was repeatedly added to the Enigma machines, making decryption more difficult and necessitating larger numbers of equipment and personnel—more than the Poles could readily produce. On 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Poles initiated French and British military intelligence representatives into their Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment, including Zygalski sheets and the cryptologic bomb, and promised each delegation a Polish-reconstructed Enigma. The demonstration represented a vital basis for the later British continuation and effort.""",29,1,joanna wyrobek,nuPZUUED5uk,0.0024999999999999996,2014-11-15 12:22:01,True,True

2019-10-08T06:40:30,"This movie is so great. Even though so many movies will put a happy ending on a sad story's real ending, this one did touch on it some.  Obviously, it fell far short of the whole truth.  I think what is most important to know and remember about Alan Turing is not the punishment the idiots of the world slam the super intelligent with after a spectacular achievement.  It's the spectacular achievement having won out against the idiots that tried so many times to stop him even as it was obviously the only hope of decoding the enigma machine, especially easily spotted in retrospect.  At the time, his ""The Imitation Game"" paper, or booklet, sparked many entirely new fields of inquiry, at least as academically acceptable fields of inquiry.  The mainstream is slow to pick up on what's in the near future.  Now, and when I was in school, the concept of artificial intelligence was a philosophical debate.  Turing was required reading.  His wasn't the first mechanical computer but the first electronic one.  This was required to meet the time turnarounds in decoding that were absolutely necessarily fast, so that action could be taken before the information was yesterday's news.  His machine was not binary.  I think it was a 6 state device and I don't know how many wide.  But we've had 3 state thyristors all this time.  Why are we limiting ourselves?  This speeds up processing power in powerfully exponential ways.  Get out a calculator and a 16 bit trinary machine has 43,046,721 states versus binary's 65,536.  Then try 32.  It's 1.85 x 10^15.  Binary is only 6.5 x 10^4.  A Trinary device, which we've had all along, has 3 states 1,0 and -1.  There are many kinds like thyristors.  The math shows you that even if you've got to slow the clock down by half, a 3 state device will blow away a binary machine, back in the 90s even, by a factor of 5x10^10.  That's 50,000,000,000 times more powerful than a binary machine of the same data width.  Why not build one now?     I think Turing has challenged us in this way.  Think big.  We know that's possible.  I just barely got going but it's just a YouTube comment.       Turing's machine was the first ELECTRONIC computer.  To those who diminished his achievement by saying that others invented the computer first. Turing invented a modern ELECTRONIC machine, and built it, (against the will of his idiot superiors, as we all do), and then used it to save the free world.  His machine was, in some ways, superior to our modern friends because it wasn't just binary.        I'm not sure why we are limiting ourselves today.  We have need of computers now that can model life and intra-atomic physics, proteins and compounds made by genes, work with their exact shapes and determine what they do and so much more.  Many sciences require enormous computational capacity.  A trinary machine would be huge and I'm not sure why I'm harping about it.  Nevermind.      Sure, we make a huge building and cram it full of blazing clock sped supercomputers.  Or, we could do the same work on a laptop running cool with billions of thyristors in it's CPU.  It's 5,000 billion times faster at chugging along at computations while saving power and size.  At half the clock speed it outperforms all supercomputers on earth, combined.   There.  Try that, world.  Ok, now I'm done.     I think the movie and Turing himself brings us a powerfully positive story, in that sometimes genius is so great it cannot be denied, even by the mass of idiots that surrounded him, and us.  It challenges us to rise to his level.        Many people in history had awful endings in life but left a powerfully positive message behind.  We all die.  The man who invented refrigeration died penniless and sick.  Imagine a world today without refrigeration.  You can't unless we kill most people on earth, and if we round up the idiots, ... maybe?  no, that's... that's what?  Is it right and moral to be so dumb that you destroy the planet that gives us all life?  That's exactly what global warming deniers are doing and so many other variations on the idiot theme.  Wouldn't it be far less moral to stand idly by while we have the means to test intelligence and eliminate the stupid from the gene pool, but we don't, the climate changes too fast for natural selection to save mammals and we are back to reptiles dominating the earth.  Maybe that's what happened the first time. But doing nothing will kill us all and our grandchildren.  Maybe a better supercomputers can help us to beat the deadline we've already passed. Question everything.      Turing  dares us to go up against, not just throngs of idiots, but the prejudices and things other commentors covered very well.   Maybe it takes time for that message to be appreciated.  But I'm not sure anymore if any idea is so great that it's ahead of it's time these days. Time moves so fast now.  For example, Musk gets a crazy idea to go to space.  Then, in a few years he's actually in space, while also doing many other things.  That's this world.  Many people, in secret of course, are breaking things we call physical laws. I don't know their intentions.  But they dated to be smarter.  They cowardly hide behind secrecy.  But who can blame them when history teaches us what happens to those who do the amazing things?  Computers have made most of us smarter.  So why not build a smarter Trinary computer?  God, where'd I get on this Trinary computer kick?  Well, Turing's machine wasn't binary.  It was more, maybe based on 6 state devices? and therefore it was very powerful even though it's wheels turned very slowly by today's standards.  So why not take up Turing's challenge to us to take a giant step, a 50 trillion times the processing power step in computing tech.  Sometimes we must rethink the gadget we're used to, and start over.  How else could we deal with today's impossible challenges?        Computer sentience is possible, as I've just showed you.  It'd be smarter than everyone combined because, since it learns from all of the most intelligent in recorded history, it will be, and then it could go far ahead, we hope. And then enslave mankind, but hey, it beats destroying earth or letting it destroy itself, whatever is going on.  Now I want to see one.     Ok, I'm tired of ranting for today.  It started out ok, but it took a tangent.  That'd be a challenge we could actually try.  It'd cost less than a satellite.  ok ok.

Skipping the fact that it's only based on a true story, I feel like The Imitation Game is not only about the life of Alan Turing, who had definitely played a big role when it comes to cracking Enigma code, it was also about the actual power of knowledge and wisdom, standing out of society, we have seen a lot of flashbacks,  discovered what Alan Turing felt and learned about his love life too. Considering the fact that's what the film was pretty much focused about, I really think it wasn't just about cracking a freaking Enigma.
