Heck when I was watching this even I wanted to have a gun like weapon implanted in my hand to use at will. How cool would that be. We need to realize that's the plan. When the New World Order is put into place people will want to take the Mark of the Beast because films like this are being used now as propaganda to prepare us for that day.  Imagine if your child was paralyzed like this man who you refuse a chip that could not only restore his motor functions but make him even ""better"" than before? I dare say most people would not. Transhumanism ( the blending of man and machine) is the agenda of the Luciferian Elites. Those without God are ignorant of such things and will willingly submit to this agenda of governmental control. To them this is mere science fiction. But believers out there please wake up.
