They've turned the whole thing into an action movie,  7. They appear to have changed the relationship between the Giver and Jonah,  8.

Second, Jonas is supposed to be young, he is supposed to be around 13-15, so are many of the other characters he interacts with (his age is vital to the plot).

I normally appreciate the difference b/w book and movie but I'm actually quite angry about this movie adaption tbh. The giver is my #1 favourite novel. It was one of the few original if not the original dystopian novels and this movie is trying to turn it into the hunger games and the Divergent series and that's making me angry. The whole point of the Giver is that it is NOT an action/thriller, it's meant to be a drama. It's meant to be innocent and naive not about Jonas finding love and rebelling. After the first half of the novel he doesn't even really talk to his friends after that. This is supposed to be Jonas' internal journey. And it's making me angry that 1. The movie is making the Giver seem like some vindictive mentor that wants to take down the council which is not necessarily true. Yes he disagrees with what the town is doing but he's too weak and too old to want to do anything. In my eyes he was always a gentle and nice man and the Giver in this movie seems mean and unpleasant. He seems unforgiving and cold. 2. The council is getting suspicious of Jonas when in the novel the council never even noticed what Jonas was doing. Especially since the Giver ultimately has more power than the council and he always gives the council guidance. 3. Jonas doesn't tell anyone about anything that the Giver has taught him except for when he plays war with his friends and tells his sister about animals but those are the few times he slips up and realizes it's better to not inform anyone around him about what he knows. 4. Jonas is 13 and he doesn't fall in love with the red headed girl and ever try to save her 5.The main reason that Jonas ""rebels"" or leaves is because of his younger brother. He doesn't want his younger brother to have to ever endure the pain of the memories. 6. Only light eyes people are supposed to be able to recieve the memories unless the person with the memories dies or if they run away.   I just don't like that they're trying to turn this amazing novel into something completely different. Most movie adaptions stick to the same plot but they remove things or change some endings but this movie just ignoring the original storyline all together and adding in things that never existed in the first place and that is why I'm mad because it really isn't the Giver. If people watch this movie and end up reading the book they will be sadly dissapointed with the novel because the movie is making this book seem like a young adult fiction or something.",44,3,Renee C,xvp6FnYWRZU,0.02142489711934157,2014-08-06 19:43:08,True,True

Books like Fahrenheit 451,  1984, The Hunger Games and other books similar to society screwing people over. The most similar things about the books I have read so far is that there is ALWAYS one PROTAGONIST who has to defeat the odds and find a way to help the people, but than at the end they always become isolated from society because they are different from all the pain they have endure. If anyone wants to say the recent movies like the Hunger Game, Divergent, and The Giver have similar plots it does but all the main characters in each book have different scenario, personally and situations they must overcome.   My thoughts on The Giver trailer it's different from the book of course. Jonas isn't twelve in the movie for some odd reason even though they hammered that age pretty hard in the book. They probably made him look like this for Teen girls to watch another pretty boy. Gabriel in the movie of course his so adorable. They made Jonas more talkative towards Fiona and Asher. Even though in the book he distance himself from them because of the pain he endures. Maybe the director wanted us to see how close Jonas can be in the movie.

2014-08-12T04:04:49,"The Giver is the only excellent dystopian children's novel I know about; I read it in middle school. Jonas in the book is only 12 years old. The Giver's memories are beautifully written, and don't shy from the truth. The descriptions of the horrors of war and especially the descriptions of pain being experienced were really, really deep things to read as a child, and I'm glad that I was able to read them.  The color thing is one of the most satisfying mid-book twists I've encountered. You didn't know they couldn't see color until he starts seeing it as a result of the memories of the past. Way to spoil it, trailer.   You also didn't know they were killing people. The book is written so that it seems to be set in a utopia, and through the Giver's memories and revelations you gradually learn that this is not quite the case.  It wasn't an ""action"" novel, but a slow-paced one. The future they live in isn't fancy and high tech, except where needed as a method of control. Society is boring and peaceful. The book's focus is on the highly charged, emotional descriptions of Jonas experiencing the memories, and his horror at realizing the truth about the world he's in and how it operates, and, most importantly, what it's missing: love.  I won't spoil the details (it would be rude, and you've all been spoiled enough) but Jonas's final act in the book is one bourne out of this missing love, that he comes to appreciate through his experience of it in The Giver's memories. It's a really sweet, and yet desperate act.  The movie looks like it's suffering from blockbuster-itis. Shiny, actiony, and they spoiled all the twists for you. I'm sure it's a fun show in its own right, but I doubt it can capture the elements that made The Giver such a beautiful experience.  Of course, a big part of what makes the book special is that we read it as kids. Things you do as kids really stick with you, you know?

Jonas does not look like his description AT all. They are supposed to be eleven years old!!! They NEVER got suspicous of him. His family was a big part of the story.

I think that I'm in the opposite position to most of the people commenting on this trailer as I have never read the book by Lois Lowry and I sat and watched this movie this morning. The film by Philip Noyce totally had me enthralled from start to finish. I think that Meryl Streep, Jeff Bridges and Brenton Thwaites were perfectly casted. I just felt for Jonas and how the whole film was a metaphor for breaking free. This film was filmed so elegantly and the use of black and white / colour was perfect. Its not trying to be an action flick or fantasy film but a good analysis of society and the huge overstatement being made about the need to over protect everything. The music was amazing and I couldnt believe that taylor swift was in the movie until I saw her name in the credits. FORGET The Hunger Games. FORGET Divergent / Insurgent. The Giver is none of those. It is not even trying to be like them. Think Pleasantville meets The Truman Show.

2015-04-18T20:18:38,"Looks depressing, will pass. Trailer reminds me of the movie, Pleasantville (Reese Witherspoon). I suspect it is about, ""waking up"". Eugenicists, for centuries, calling their religion Christianity, or ""Ziah-nism"" (be careful how you pronounce Holy Words, and Holy Names, such as Zion, or Israel), have advocated a ""racial purity"" theology - claiming that genetics establishes holiness - namely, if somebody is not biologically related to Abraham, he may be put to death, or used as a slave.  They would have many believe that holiness is established in the bloodline, rather than through behaviour - doing good, striving to be, or remain, holy, etc... And so, the logical consequence of their theology has been to look upon women as ""breeding vessels"" (hence, this manmade word rape, is composed of the same letters as this word reap), and ""coloured men"" as a ""resource"" - to be used as slaves, or put to death.  They have also adovocated theft of property - especially land, but really, anything of value to them, found in the possession of ""coloureds"". I think the Trailer, for this movie, The Giver, hints at this.  How can you fight an enemy if you do not know the enemy exists? Such eugenicists, are simply worthy of death. ..... Only True Believers are able to say, ""Jesus Christ is Lord"". Pronunciation matters.  The letter 't' in 'Christ' is NOT a ""silent letter"" as it is in 'castle'.",0,0,Kelly KitKat,xvp6FnYWRZU,0.13333333333333333,2015-04-18 20:18:38,False,False

If you fully read the book first then you would realize that in the movie of ""The Giver"" they skip many scenes like Jonas seeing color from an apple and goes straight to Jonas wondering about his ceremony. He tells us about his community and his best friends, Fiona and Asher. The next day he goes straight to the ceremony of the twelve but in the movie there was romance associated and added so Jonas and his friends were actually probably 16-18 years old, not 12. Then it's all pretty much the same as the book, the elder chief calls everyone except Jonas then says she has made a mistake and ask for apology. She then announces that Jonas is The Reciever and they recite his name. After that he was sent to The Giver to recieve memories and the next day he said he saw his best friend, Fiona, and realized she had red hair. He started to feel affections towards Fiona and tried to pass his memory to Fiona but he had failed to and so she didn't see color. He went around showing his best friends and other people his training which he wasn't allowed to and was kept an eye on by the elder cheif 24/7. Then he learns about music and Rosemary, the past Reciver who was failed as a Reciver  and died from being released which actually means getting a poisonous injection and you die. He then wants to run away from his community but immedietly escaped with Gabriel which he wasn't actually suppose to run away with but did because he heard from his father that Gabriel was going to be released which meant he was going to die. He got the help from Fiona and at that time Fiona loved Jonas because she had feelings after not getting her daily shots which Jonas had told her to do but his other best friend, Asher, did not help him and tried to stop him because he felt obligated that it was the right thing to do. Jonas then escapes and causes a tantrum for the elder chief and his friend Asher tracks him down but lets him go because he is his best friend. He then lies to the elder chief that he had killed and gotten rid of Jonas(and Gabriel). Jonas couldn't make it anymore until he saw the sled that he remembered from his first training session of recieving memories. Jonas slies down the sled along with Gabriel and then pass the existence of boundary and everyone is safe. Fiona wasn't released and so wasn't The Giver and everyone recieved back memories of the good and bad of the past and emotions too. Jonas is left finding a house and hears music but perhaps it was an echo...(I know, I hate cliffhangers too).",0,0,Amy Li,xvp6FnYWRZU,0.14293854293854294,2015-06-16 20:27:44,False,False

Isn't that a good thing? Maybe I'm being unreasonable and in real life it wouldn't work nearly as well, especially if you dropped some of the worst components (e.g. killing people), but in the fictional world everyone is treated equally and given equal rights. Even the people in the government aren't significantly more prosperous then they average citizen. Yes, choice is vertically non existent, but is that really such a bad thing if everyone is happy and healthy?

Mucha gente opina como yo, que es una buena película, sacada de un gran libro.

En mi opinión debo decir que me ha fascinado la idea, el desarrollo, los actores... todo.   A la gente que se ha leído el libro y no le ha gustado la película, os respeto y os entiendo. Pero entender que al igual que vosotros os leeis el libro y os imaginais como serían los personajes, el paisaje y todo lo demás... a los creadores de la película les ocurre lo mismo. Cada uno es libre de imaginarse el libro a su manera, así que si tú te lo imaginaste a la tuya, es comprensible que la película no haya sido hecha de acuerdo a tu imaginación.

I loved them movie for multiple reasons.  1. Brenton Thwaites 😍 2. I could understand ehat was going on in the movie unlike the book So all of you people hating on this movie are probably gtown adults that read this in school. If you were to read then watch the movie it has a way different effect on how you watch it. Of course there are some differences. Directors have to do that so not everybody is saying oh they had no creatkve ideas for this film so they just copied the entire book. Of course there are different ways different people think.

In the book “I” didn’t see any information that could hint there being a wall or a drop around the city. I think it just was normal nature with animals and waterfalls, hills and city’s and so on.  The world is obviously shaped from war or similar, and that’s is why they did all those rules and things to keep the citizens safe.   I could explain more, but I read this book in one day as a school project and all this is from my memory and I could probably create a similar world that the author was trying to get.
