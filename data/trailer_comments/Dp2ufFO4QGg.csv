I don't mean to bash sci-fi or fantasy (some of my other favorite books are sci-fi and fantasy), but it bothers me when anyone reads one or two types of book to the complete exclusion of works that don't fit their narrow scope because they miss out on so many great things that they would probably enjoy if only they were willing to give something different a chance.
