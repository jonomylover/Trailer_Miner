2016-04-25T13:30:47,I'm gonna post the same thing here as I did on Twentieth Century Fox UK.  I'm here before all the negative bullsh#t. You wanted to know where wolverine was here he is. You were whining about mystique being with the x-men and a hero now you see that she doesn't want to be one. You were complaining about lack of jubilee here she is. You were complaining about apocalypse's voice the first trailer they changed it and in the second and you still complained. Whining because he's blue when he's been blue in comics before and though it looks slightly different his costume takes many parts from his comic costume if you look closely.  There's constructive criticism and then there's hating for the sake if hating.  And what many people are doing is hating.  They claim not to like these movies but miraculously show up to every new video about them.,8,4,J. L. F.,Jer8XjMrUB4,0.08636363636363636,2016-04-25 13:30:47,True,True

I'm so glad they didn't spoil anything too drastic like most superhero movie trailers do. I'm also really glad Quicksilver is magneto's son and it'll be really interesting to see how that dynamic plays out. I'm hoping that they also explore the maternal relationship between Kurt and Raven, maybe before Azazal (I'm sure I spelled that wrong) was captured him and Mystique got a little friendly if you know what I mean. Or they could do the origin that played out in the 90's animated series where she just hooks up with a human and baby night crawler comes out but she has to give him away.

The original X Men franchise started when I was in my early years, the first one came out in 2000 when I was 4, & it to see them still making films 16 years later is something that I kinda do cherish.   The original movies had 3, X Men, X2, & the last stand. This one has first class, days of future past, and now apocalypse, so it looks like this is the swan song. Not just basing off of what we're seeing in these trailers but the new fresh takes on, Storm, jean grey, cyclops, hopefully they'll get angel right.  Which it's cool to see Tyler Sheridan who plays a young Scott Summers get this chance, only 19 and has starred in great movies like mud, Joe and while not most liked scouts guide to the apocalypse, I thought it was pretty decent.

2016-04-25T18:16:28,"Was anyone¬†else bothered by the absolute wrong angle that Wolverine's claws came out at the end?First of all, his claws don't ""magically"" come out PERFECTLY from between his knuckles - they come from inside his forearms, and pierce through his wrist, coming out through his hands (more specifically, the top of his hands). But even if for these movies, they don't come out on top of his hands, and through in between his knuckles every time, they would still be in line with the bones of his fingers, thus, parallel with his bones in his palms. Even if you argue that they are fully extended, the bottom end of his claws don't end at his knuckles - they end far deeper, like around the top of the forearms just below the wrist. So, it's a physical impossibility that they would be angled down, like they are in that shot. The way they look, it looks like the claws are attached to a wooden piece, and Wolverine is clutching that wooden piece, making it look like this, as opposed to as if they were coming through his forearms and hands........which is exactly what they did practically for the effect in the movie. Which is fine, but, mind your angles people. ugh!This is a lazy, amateur, mistake. Someone could have easily prevented by saying something. Random Dude on the set - ""Hey, Bryan, you might want to re shoot that last shot, his fist looks like he's clutching the Wood piece with the claws too much, it looks unnatural.""Bryan - ""Oh yeah, you're right. The claws should be as straight as his hand and forearms. Thank....you.""",0,2,ŒôŒµœÅœéŒΩœÖŒºŒøœÇ ŒöœåœÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÇ,Jer8XjMrUB4,0.16375661375661377,2016-04-25 18:16:28,True,True

Mutants still can't get along so the ones that everyone wants to see as good guys are somehow on Apocalypse's side? Why not just make a proper team and stick to it for once.

Dr. Doom was a disgrace and not even remotely close to how he is portrayed in the comics. Galactus amounted to a cloud of space debris and was defeated easily despite being established in the comics as one of the top tier entities and a universal constant within the multiverse. Ultron, who has a lengthy and well established backstory as a creation of Hank Pym, to the point that Pym actually perceives Ultron to be his son for all intents and purposes. However, even though Hank Pym is clearly included in the timeline due to the release of Antman, they decided to scrap the entire known backstory and make Ultron an invention of Tony Stark, thereby nullifying everything we had come to know previously. Now, Mystique is a hero, instead of a villain, and is apparently leading the X-Men into battle against one of their biggest threats ever. It's just ridiculous how badly some of these stories have been hacked apart. And this isn't even getting into the fact that now characters like Thor and Wolverine have vaginas.

2016-04-25T22:30:20,I actually love this trailer. This is as accurate to the source material Fox has gone with this franchise. They are taking parts of the MCU formula and adapting it well to the X-Men. @ 0:35 reminds me of the Avengers money shot scene where they assemble after hulk destroys the space whale lol. Fox has adapted that scene for Apocalypse and his horsemen I couldn't be any happier as a fan of the genre.,0,0,Sooper 17,Jer8XjMrUB4,0.5666666666666668,2016-04-25 22:30:20,True,True

It wasn't 100% true to the source material, and it bothered me (us comic book fans) b/c we know there is more. I realize though that not everyone has read or reads comics, so they have to twist and turn things to make it work for the big screen.

First of all, it's J-Law -- one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Of course the camera is going to focus on her. Second, her portrayal of Raven/Mystique has been different since she took up the role in XMFC. Yes, Rebecca Romijn's portrayal was more accurate to the comics, but it's obvious that Bryan Singer and the producers wanted to go a different route with Jennifer's portrayal of the character. That's not her fault. While I enjoyed Rebecca's badass!Mystique in the original trilogy, I have also loved Jennifer playing the character with more heart and compassion.

I vaguely recognize the spirit of the actual characters you're representing in maybe 2 or 3 of these guys. You've ignored so much that it just seems like you programmed a script generator with 15-20 mutants, titled some as heroes, titled some as villains, leaving about 8 untitled, programmed it heavy on Mystique (one of those not titled as either hero or villain) and set the trope threshold to HIGH, hit generate and printed out the first copy as the final.  This is how you kill a franchise. Stop making the same, tired studio decisions, at least for known series with big histories like comics do. Let your creative people be creative and either find a cool way to tell an existing story, or make a new story that fits mostly within the existing framework.

The closest to that was the first x-men movie when toad takes off his glasses and he tears down the ceiling of the trainstation without even wanting to.  In all these new movies he barely exists, and if he shows up, hes barely relevant. Just like Colossus, except in the DeadPool movie in which Colossus was awesome, or Jugernaut that even Colossus needed the help of the other x-men to take him down. Trying to place star actors with more relevancy in the storyline than the strongest mutants and what they could accomplish to solve the storys problems makes theses movies nonsensical even inside the x-men world. Kinda like how Flash cant dodge the simplest things in the series in order to make some of the villains relevent, when he can pretty much stop time.

2016-04-27T11:26:56,"Following is a letter to his daughter from a renowned Hong Kong TV broadcaster and Child Psychologist. The words are actually applicable to all of us, young or old, children or parents.! This applies to all sons & daughters too. All parents can use this in their teachings to their children.   Dear daughter,  I am writing this to you because of 3 reasons  1. Life, fortune and mishaps are unpredictable, nobody knows how long he lives. Some words are better said early.  2. I am your father, and if I don't tell you these, no one else will.  3. What is written is my own personal bitter experiences that perhaps could save you a lot of unnecessary heartaches. Remember the following as you go through life..  1. Do not bear grudge towards those who are not good to you. No one has the responsibility of treating you well, except your mother and I. To those who are good to you, you have to treasure it and be thankful, and ALSO you have to be cautious, because, everyone has a motive for every move. When a person is good to you, it does not mean he really will be good to you. You have to be careful, don't hastily regard him as a real friend.  2. No one is indispensable, nothing is in the world that you must possess. Once you understand this idea, it would be easier for you to go through life when people around you don't want you anymore, or when you lose what you wanted the most.  3. Life is short. When you waste your life today, tomorrow you would find that life is leaving you. The earlier you treasure your life, the better you enjoy life.  4. Love is but a transient feeling, and this feeling would fade with time and with one's mood. If your so called loved one leaves you, be patient, time will wash away your aches and sadness. Don't over exaggerate the beauty and sweetness of love, and don't over exaggerate the sadness of falling out of love.  5.A lot of successful people did not receive a good education, that does not mean that you can be successful by not studying hard! Whatever knowledge you gain is your weapon in life. One can go from rags to riches, but one has to start from some rags!  6.I do not expect you to financially support me when I am old, neither would I financially support your whole life. My responsibility as a supporter ends when you are grown up. After that, you decide whether you want to travel in a public transport or in your limousine, whether rich or poor.  7. You honour your words, but don't expect others to be so. You can be good to people, but don't expect people to be good to you. If you don't understand this, you would end up with unnecessary troubles.  8. I have bought lotteries for umpteen years, but I could never strike any prize. That shows if you want to be rich, you have to work hard! There is no free lunch!  9. No matter how much time I have with you, let's treasure the time we have together. We do not know if we would meet again in our next life.  Your Parent   have a nice day!",0,0,90's ·àç·åÜ·âΩ official,Jer8XjMrUB4,0.20000982704402506,2016-04-27 11:26:56,True,True

2016-04-27T12:58:25,"I'm just gonna post this comment made by someone on another website.  Sir, or ma'am,  if you see this thank you for making sense.   The biggest wedge that drew Xavier and Mystique apart was his condescending and overprotective paternalistic attitude towards her.   Throughout FC, he keeps Mystique under control. He refuses to give her alcohol in case she slips up in public, he does not reassure her about her natural blue form (see his positive immediate response to Mystique's 'Would you date me?' when he was assuming that she was talking about her human form, and then the hesitation when he realises exactly what she was talking about).   This continues into DOFP, where for the majority of the movie he acts like a parent bringing a wayward child home, refusing to acknowledge that Mystique is her own woman now who makes her own choices. It is only when he realises this mistake and willingly backs off, does the plot resolve.  Now look at X3, a timeline in which Xavier never learned his mistake with Mystique. He suppresses and controls Jean's power for her own good against her will, much like how he insists Mystique to continue hiding for her own protection. There is a very clear throughline here.   Saying it's Xavier's fault is maybe a bit much, but they were both directly the result of his failure to realise the importance of choice, and how he needs to have faith and hope that people can make the right choices. It's a pretty neat thematic character arc I think that ties all these movies together.",52,6,J. L. F.,Jer8XjMrUB4,0.22744382601525456,2016-04-27 12:58:25,True,True

Also seems like it brings in humor at times as well.  I think that as a Christian in watching these films we must remember that we have one God, the God of the Bible. In it the main villain is described as a god like figure, if not a god himself. We must remember that the Bible teaches that there is only one God and there are no others. I believe this film is a fine film to let children who are mature, watch. Teach them that it is not real and that the biblical concepts are that there is only one God.

So does anyone think this is a little bit similar X2? except Apocalypse is going to destroy the world and has charles with him? I have another feeling that around the story, The Xmen have to stop apocalypse and William Stryker finds out about Mystique and thinks they still need her for experimentation, Basically Weapon X (if this story takes place around 1980, it would make more sense for wolverine to come to play considering Xmen Origins happened, and that Blob was kick-boxing, plus we got a pic of Blob against Angel.)

Come on, come on you better pray for a miracle. Come on, come on if you survive this round. Step it up or you'll be going down."". Given that Nightcrawler looks like a demon and he's the religious sort who would pray for a miracle, I think this song would be good for him in an AMV.

Dark Phoenix is not on the level of Apocolypse's calibre, and if she was Apocolyose wouldn't be wiped out just in seconds like he was in the film, this is Apocalypse we're talking about, renowned as being one of Marvels most powerful Villians.

No. Still it is dynamic, fast paced, thrilling,  tense and captivating film. Pros: - great chemistry among the characters - great new additions to the universe - action is spectacular - cgi looks awesome - humour worked - memorable scenes - wolverine cameo - frightening villain - fast paced - cool references Cons: - cliched storyline - logic is not always the strong with this one - drama felt forced and uninspiring - cliched villain - dialogue was hit and miss - predictable in the end So it is not very deep and profound film, but it is far from those blockbusters that attack your senses and beat you with the effects all the time.

So in comparison to ""Days of Future's Past"" which was a magnificent movie ""in my opinion, the best in X-Man history and maybe even Marvel history"" this movie¬†is just¬†simply very good. Sort of like The Avengers, ""Age of Ultron"" would have been better received by fans and critics¬†I think if it wasn't being compared to the first outstanding¬†film The Avengers. Regardless of this however, ""Apocalypse"" was very good film and it sets up a future movie with Jean Gray that could be excellent if DONE RIGHT the next time.

And ultimately, Jean is a ""broken"" character design in the first place, her powers are too strong and not interesting, making the x-men universe so unbalance, Bryan Singer tried so hard to fix the things from the 3rd movie, from Jean to the Angel mutant, but the result is mediocre and awkward. I love Days of Future Past and First Class, the clever use of the interesting mutants made the movie very fun to watch and also I feel for the mutants.

Bring his true inner powers and abilities out rather than what you had done to him in the movie. Apocalypse in true form will have to make a return to the timeline again, because he knows about Phoenix (Jean Grey), he felt her powers in which she destroyed him (I would like to say a miniature clone) at the end. If he do make a come back, the movie should be called X-men: THE AGE of APOCALYPSE.  A major reason why this should happen because a character in the upcoming movie, Deadpool 2 can tie all the different timelines of the X-men movies and plus X-men:DoFP has helped to shape the universe. Then this could mean Logan died in an alternate world, but is still alive in the real world.
