So many great characters rarely given any screen time or lazy dialogue or even written out of the story completely. I had high hopes for this franchise until about Resident evil Extinction...After that film i lost all hope.  Example where did the little girl angela ashford go after the 2nd film? Why was a major character like barry burton given such a small part and then killed off in the most recent installment of the franchise? Where is rebecca chambers?!?!?! Why has chris redfield only appeared in a single film? Why has leon kennedy only appeared in a single film? These are not small throw away characters they deserved better than they have got so far in the franchise.  Why has a film not been set in caliban cove? Why was the mansion proper used so little in the first film? It played a major part in the book and game. Where is sherry birkin from resident evil 2(The game) Chief irons from re2 Brad vickers Annette birkin...........I mean dang the list is endless of how they could have added so much more to the lore and world of the films and yet choose to put stereotypes and 2nd rate characters in place of fan favorites.,0,0,Bandedcookie,jbtmW3ydOkU,0.014017857142857141,2016-08-09 23:25:26,True,True

So focused that they won't bother telling you what happened to the other characters. (Angie Ashford of Re:Apocalypse). And now by looking at this trailer looks like Chris Redfield is nowhere to be seen. presumably died from the ship saving claire. And where is Ada,Leon,Jill? Ill just assume that the last chapter happened 1,2 or maybe 5 years after Retribution or if it's continued just like Afterlife and Retribution that they all died with wesker(maybe) defending the white house or somewhere along that line. eitherway is the laziest way to end someones character.

I speed run nemesis 3 times a week. I do not go a month without playing through 0,1,2 and 3. Its just something that i enjoy doing on a regular basis when i have down time. I am sick and tired of so called RE purists online thinking they can come on here and speak for all of us.  I for one enjoy the hell out of these movies. To be honest, the story line in the game while insane and outlandish, is the weakest part of the series and is not the defining factor of the series for me. I simply love the world and characters. I really really like that they did their own thing with the movies. When i want traditional RE i will go play the first 3 games. The rest of you negative nancies really need to learn to give things a chance, rather than having unreal expectations for everything.

I liked the idea of Alice at first but it's kind of gotten old.. Like we barely even got to see Tyrant. And they never even brought William Berkin into the mix. They could have stuck a bit closer to the actual story. But at least the movie looks action packed and entertaining.,0,0,Bee 4 Time,jbtmW3ydOkU,0.25833333333333336,2016-08-15 02:19:54,True,True

2016-08-15T02:49:34,Guys as a fan of RE games. I find this series as a very fascinating one because the only problem here is the title. And for added information guys it is said that `based  on the game resident evil ` so if you find that the story is quite different think about it the film was only based so the director would probably change something. And guys as a fan whenever I saw some negative reviews in this movie coming to those people that is a fan of RE I feel sad and disappointed because as a fan of RE even though the movie have a lot of weaknesses as a fan you should support it. And last one guys please watch it because this is tha least one please gave this movie a good box office .Thank you,0,0,Herald Jay Bautista,jbtmW3ydOkU,-0.13666666666666666,2016-08-15 02:49:34,True,True

They rip scenes from the games and make it worst.  4. Nemesis Game: A tyrant that was more stonger,durable,intelligent than an standard tyrant. Was created by umbrella and was task to kill all remaining ""Star Members"" .  Primary weapon: Rocket Launcher . Appearance: Long black trench coat ( to keeps his tentacles from going wild)  Speed: Moved at incredible speed (was the fastest enemy in the game)  Strength: He would either crush your head like a melon or use his tentacles to instant kill you.  Durability: Got blown up twice,pushed off of two cliffs,got electrocuted,fell into a bath full of acid,got shot by a laser canon, then took 6 magnun shots , then finally got destroyed by the nuke.  Attitude: Was a ruthless killer and only care about his mission and destroying anything in it's path.  Nemesis Movie: Was the host of Matt and was created from a scratch of a licker and was Alice's best friend.    Primary weapon: Gatling Gun.  Appearance: Long black trench coat.  Speed: Only walked ( and was very slow ) the entire movie.  Strength: Was very weak and got beat by Alice.  Durability: Died from an helicopter landing on him.  Attitude: At first was an ruthless killer then later had feelings for Alice.  5.

I hope there is NEVER a reboot just in spite of those who continue to hate on the movie series cus it's not like the games. don't hate unless you can make a better movie AS WE SPEAK! if not then shut up and either watch or dont. cus you can say you can do better all you want but until you show video proof stop complaining.,0,0,WolfDenUniverse,jbtmW3ydOkU,-0.0532239690134427,2016-10-12 20:53:41,True,True
