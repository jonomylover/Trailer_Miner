Though the only thing I remember is the iconic scene where the Giant reaches through the window and grabs the girl. They got that scene down (though I don't remember her being in an orphanage).  Honestly, for an adaptation of a book like the BFG, Spielberg is by far the best choice. No one is better at thrusting amazing fantasy concepts onto our contemporary world, or sending children on harrowing and often terrifying adventures that would be considered a lot even for adults. My only concern is that due to the books age, its wonderful and charming message might fall flat with today's 'discerning' (translation: boring) audiences and critics. No one's allowed to feel good at the movies anymore, don't you know.

I'm guessing those elements are kept in, because why else would you hire Stephen Spielberg, who is the master of making that stuff work, but . . . On the other hand, the trailer doesn't spoil anything beyond the basic premise so that's a plus I guess. I'm having a hard time telling here, but I hope to God that the BFG is an actual person and not a completely CGI character.  Good make-up and camera tricks would look so much better than a completely CGI character in this case (not to mention, it would probably be cheaper).",0,0,cheezemonkeyeater,VG5MtenlP-A,0.05303030303030301,2015-12-09 23:34:36,True,True

I was so excited, and I felt I needed to do a backflip. I guess Sophie looks more like a girl than the animated movie. I think this movie is gonna ROCK!  Ruby Barnhill who is playing Sophie in this movie, fits the character perfectly and I love her voice. It fits Sophie being a resourceful and brave young girl.  I love how she says, ""Never get out of bed. Never go to the window. Never look behind the curtain."" I could totally see what she meant, how the BFG kidnapped her and took her away to Giant Country.  I can't wait for this movie to come out!

2015-12-12T03:48:40,"I don't know how to feel about the prospect of this film.  I am a great lover of the book, as I have been since I read it as a child.  I'm a Spielberg nut, and have followed his career for almost all of it.  My favourite Spielberg film is E.T. which was written by the same screenwriter as this film, Melissa Mathison, who I'm sad to say is no longer with us.  So what worries me?  The artificiality of digital magic.  Even in this teaser I cannot ignore the CG elements and recognise them as something that would sit better in a video game rather than a film.  When I was a kid, movies were made more exciting by their effects which we watched in awe and asked, 'How did they do that?'  I haven't heard that question for a long time in reference to a film.  Of course there is no reason to ask it because these days everything is done in a computer and that is rarely convincing.  Computer animation integrated with live action so draws attention to itself, which makes it more difficult to suspend belief.  I may wait to see this until it is on Blu-Ray or something just because I doubt whether I would personally be able to concentrate on the story without looking too critically at the CG.  Having never missed a Spielberg release, that will be a tragic first.",0,0,Francis X. Lord,VG5MtenlP-A,0.1255980861244019,2015-12-12 03:48:40,True,True
