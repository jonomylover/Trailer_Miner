2014-04-13T04:44:40,"Completely disappointing and utterly boring movie. It fails to deliver on both the generic jump scares as well as psychological horror. You can tell that the movie may have had an interesting concept as a short piece but does not stretch out to a full feature. This is the first film I have ever been to with audience members asleep, yawning, and leaving halfway through. The film sets up no distinguishable back story to the mirror which many critics praise as not spoon feeding to the audience which I get but unfortunately the plot is so thin that a little taste of what was going on would have been great. The mirror fails completely as a scary force and instead puts the characters through a series of poorly edited and sometimes confusing trip to relive the trauma of their childhood to which we already establish the outcome 5 minutes into the film. (On a side note, as a certified veterinary technician it made me laugh out loud that there was one scene in particular involving the family dog that uses parvo virus to explain the way the animal was acting despite the writers having no clue as to how the virus actually works but that is just a nitpick on a professional level) The movie ultimately goes no where and the psychological terror never amounts to any level of thrill or dread. I cannot stress enough how much this movie completely fails as a horror movies as well as a coherent film in general.

Ok while many titles this year that have to do with the suspense, thriller or horror genre there hasn't been one quite as chilling as Oculus.  The reason this movie has such an interesting chill factor is because instead of a blunt enemy, it's instead a huge game of mind vs mind. The feeling of not being able to control your own mind is what makes this movie very scary.  I dunno personally my fear in a ""monster"" is more of a ghost simply because you can't really fight a ghost.  And like a ghost you can't really fight what your mind is telling you.  The concept is amazing to me. I give Oculus an 8/10. Yes it was a great movie to break away from this years pattern but it just seemed too blandly done.  It seemed like they wanted to use the minimum amount of resources which is sad because this could have done better. I could tell where the story was heading a little bit before the midway point. It's worth a watch but I'd recommend waiting for the DVD.

2014-04-25T04:27:46,"Just saw this movie today - Never has a horror movie really bothered me so much. And I don't mean it was disturbing or scary, but it was a movie that came SO CLOSE to being very interesting, but instead settles for mediocrity. If they really pushed the boundaries and delved more into a question of ""Is this just main two character's latent psychosis and their mentality breaking down upon a traumatic injury or is something supernatural occurring here"" this would've been a ground breaking movie. And for a while, it does this very successfully and it kept me guessing whether or not what I was watching real or not. But the concept seems like it's abandoned half way through the movie and it settles for mediocrity. For something that came so close to being successful, it bothers me a lot that they abandon this factor halfway through.    - Now for what it is, it's still a cut above the rest. It's not boring or insulting my intelligence like another movie I know -cough Conjuring cough-. But rather the story it presents is still very interesting, and frightening at times. It does not rely on cheap scares but rather sticks heavily to atmosphere. The movie is separated into two separate time lines (taking a page from True Detective's book) and knowing what happens in the flash backs, really help draw more focus into the atmosphere since there is no shock value or wondering to the story. The main two characters (both incarnations) are likeable and the child acting is decent. Despite missing its mark, Oculus really does stand a cut above most horror movies that have come out lately. Although it comes so close to levels of the Haunting and the Shining at times that it's almost cringe worthy in parts where they do actually give evidence that the mirror is haunted. Had they kept the idea of two separate flash backs going, and that the way one of them (or both) remembered things may not have been what actually happened, and whether or not the mirror was actually haunted would've made for a much more interesting story. But for what it was, it wasn't bad.",15,1,DickVonPounDatSnatch,dYJrxezWLUk,0.09619708994708995,2014-04-25 04:27:46,False,True

In my opinion, this movie does its part of the job superbly and I enjoyed the movie a lot. It has a great plot, good acting performance, fast paced action, beautifully shot scenes and excellent chemistry between actors. And I'm not usually impressed with horror movies or mysteries, but this movie was really good, especially considering the budget. Actually, it's on my list of the best mystery horror movies.

It's peculiar how people screams and grimaces at horror movies that screams cheap, cliché and gore, but hates this type of intelligent horror movie. Oculus, in my opinion, is smart and digs deep in the realm of psychology. It does have jump scares but just a few, enough to maintain the barrier separating it from the cliché. Mostly, it exploits the tragedy of the Russel's years ago and now. And it has to be confusing because if this was real, you'd be incredibly confused as well; how else would you feel if you saw your 10 years old self walking around in present? And will you be scared shitless if you realised you're knee-deep in the mirror maze and there's no way out? Will you be terrified if you suddenly don't know where you are and what is real? Like halfway through a dream but there's no waking up? Also, the ending, you have to admit that it's a massive punch in the face (if the social media hasn't spoilt it for you yet).   I'd give the producers a big compliment for crafting such a good movie. We don't see this kind of depth in horror movies these days.

2015-07-05T07:35:22,"Spoiler Alert:  Having seen this movie, its pretty ridiculous how the daughter was supposedly trying to fight this mirror with intelligence and prove to the world the mirror is cursed, but she knew it can manipulate people's perception and has a limit on its range of influence before she even started the experiment. Setting up a timed execution trap but allowing the trap to be in full contact by themselves after the experiment started was a huge mistake, especially when she fully knew the mirror would ""do everything it can to prevent it"" right from the beginning as she said. If a mirror could really do the things it did in the movie, there's pretty much no way of proving its powers because all it does is control people. The most you would be able to record are plants dying really fast on camera but anything else would just look like some psychopathic people killing themselves. If it really does have a range of influence, get 1 person to place the mirror in an open field and another person with a sniper rifle to shoot it from afar.",0,0,Ben L,dYJrxezWLUk,0.2144557823129252,2015-07-05 07:35:22,False,False

The writing was poor, the acting was sub-par, but to be fair to the actors, they had horrible material to go off of. There was a cool concept here, and nothing more. The execution was so contrived all I could help but think immediately after viewing was exactly what Katee Sackhoff's character said about the eponymous mirror: ""A bit ostentatious, don't you think?"" The movie sucked its own dick and the only reason there was a story in the first place was because the characters were written to be too stupid to do the intelligent thing. You'll find yourself wanting to yell at the characters to stop doing stupid crap like resetting the kill-switch timer. All that said, I have one more question: Why the hell didn't they just make the kill switch non-lethal to a person and hang it up high and have the timer drop the mirror on the ground.

The people who created this movie based it off of String Theory (Quantum Physics), and the mirror is symbolic of the aliens that are controlling humanity... constantly manipulating our thoughts through telepathy, and since we live in a thought universe this alters our reality around us... Those who dig deep into the occult usually (in this universe anyways) end up losing their soul... How this happens, is because the 'spirits' that guide humanity (angels, demons, ancestors, so be you) always end up guiding humanity to the realization that reality is an ILLUSION, nothing matters, and everything is you... which in a sense is true, but not completely... You create reality, seeing is not believing, but believing is seeing... Only when you believe something with 100% conviction will it become a reality, and with religions like Christianity or Islam, teaching contradictions, and with those who delve down the path of 'truth' are often faced with misunderstandings themselves which lead them to contradictions, but they're always guided by extra-terrestrials...

2018-10-18T01:12:55,"'How to prepare for paranormal activity and still screw up'. I only watched it just now, and I understand why the movie is so controversial. It doesn't matter wether the movie is about how far the paranormal could potentially push a person to lose grip on reality - I just didn't 'feel' the movie. Ultimately it doesn't matter how much a movie exploits a potentiality, if one doesn't enjoy watching it. Rest is a SPOILER, so be warned:  Would you seriously just assume you're conjuring up your fiancee and just stab him in the neck with a glass shard, without checking first - blindly assuming its an hallucination? When you're even remotely an out-of-the-box thinker you should've figured that the mirror could do things you wouldn't be able to predict. Even when they realized it could temporarily have them perform activities they weren't aware of, they still CHOSE to stick around. Its one thing to be stuck in a brilliant illusion, its another thing to simply make stupid decisions. Like many horrors, I feel their choices just didn't make sense. Many times one of the most frustrating things is that horrors contain characters that are either stupid or mentally weak. I love the occasional strong character that fights back. I thought it would happen in this movie... but it didn't. Pointless ending, making the boy end up back where he started.  However one wants to sugarcoat how brilliantly this movie is... it was just frustrating for me to watch. The frustrating part was partly in the truth of how society works. If you remember something correctly... but something that most people can't accept... they'll just 'shrink' you down and make you swallow enough pills until you're acceptable for the rest of society. 'We will only believe your story if its within our paradigm of what we're comfortable with.' So yeah, lucky boy. At the end of the movie he now knows whats in store for him.
