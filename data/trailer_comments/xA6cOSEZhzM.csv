Alvin and the Chipmunks went on a 4 year hiatus, it was basically forgotten by everyone in less than 2 years.   More money was spent on Star Wars than Alvin and the Chipmunks.   Star Wars has a massive, extensive universe, with an amazing story, characters, visuals.  Alvin and the Chipmunks has a very small, very limited universe, with the only story being a bunch of chipmunks are on a trip, the characters aren't all that great (Except Simon) and the visuals are pretty good at best.  And yet, there are some people out there asking ""Why isn't there anyone watching Alvin and the Chipmunks?"" Well, there's your answer, Star Wars is simply better than Alvin and the Chipmunks.

No David Cross. 2. Jason Lee doesn't have the same house set as he did before. 3. The Chipettes had very little screen time, and all they were doing was sitting in their  chairs, judging the singers, throughout the whole movie. I'm not joking. That's what I saw. Does that mean they were sitting there for a week? Come on.  Going back to what I was saying in number three, I actually thought it was good that they focused more on the Chipmunks, instead of the Chipettes. My overall rating:  2 stars.
