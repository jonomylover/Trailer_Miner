Tubman is such an iconic figure in American history that I'd expect more time to be taken to tell this powerful story. I'm not sure if it's just a shitty trailer, or if this is really how it's going to be. I expected to get a more intense take. I don't know. I haven't seen the movie so I can't judge.

2019-07-24T03:31:39,"As an actual ADOS NOT supporting this new Harriet Tubman movie at all!    So tired of these non-ADOS Black immigrants (who're mostly Nigerian-British) playing key ADOS historical figures in American film productions.     Folks felt some kind of way with me for me not really liking 12  Years A Slave. Not that Chiwetel Ejiofor or Lupita Nyong'o aren't good actors, but I just didn't/couldn't feel them in the roles they portrayed. I only felt their portrayals in a performative sense and not in a way that convinced me that they WERE the characters. Conversely, when Denzel portrayed Malcolm X, I FELT him as Malcolm.    For example, it's not that a non-Jewish White actor COULDN'T portray or WOULDN'T do a good job portraying a Jewish Holocaust survivor, it's just that, it wouldn't/can't hit the same. Just how deeply could they get into the role? There's just a different kind of energy/spirit that lineage enables.    Not to mention the fact that the Nigerian-British actor they have portraying Harriet Tubman (an ADOS legendary hero) has made anti-ADOS statements all on her Twitter and cosigned anti-ADOS Tweets from other non-ADOS Black immigrants and Whites. Furthermore, I think it's high time we started learning about the lineage of many of these non-ADOS Blacks portraying ADOS historical figures. I mean, I think it'd be an unforgivable insult to have someone, who's ancestors participated in the enslavement of our ancestors, portraying our ancestors.    #LineageMatters #ADOS #AttackOfTheBodySnatchers #HeritageTheft #LineageThieves",2,5,Steven Dunn,GqoEs4cG6Uw,0.13091189674523007,2019-07-24 03:31:39,True,True

Fuck em up Harriet ‚úä‚úä‚úä‚úä FREDRIC BASIAT ‚ÄúThe Law‚Äù 1850-‚ÄúPerverted Law Causes Conflict As long as it is admitted that the law may be diverted from its true purpose ‚Äî that it may violate property instead of protecting it ‚Äî then everyone will want to participate in making the law, either to protect himself against plunder or to use it for plunder. Political questions will always be prejudicial, dominant, and all-absorbing. There will be fighting at the door of the Legislative Palace, and the struggle within will be no less furious. To know this, it is hardly necessary to examine what transpires in the French and English legislatures; merely to understand the issue is to know the answer. Is there any need to offer proof that this odious perversion of the law is a perpetual source of hatred and discord; that it tends to destroy society itself? If such proof is needed, look at the United States [in 1850]. There is no country in the world where the law is kept more within its proper domain: the protection of every person's liberty and property. As a consequence of this, there appears to be no country in the world where the social order rests on a firmer foundation. But even in the United States, there are two issues ‚Äî and only two ‚Äî that have always endangered the public peace. Slavery and Tariffs Are Plunder What are these two issues? They are slavery and tariffs. These are the only two issues where, contrary to the general spirit of the republic of the United States, law has assumed the character of a plunderer. Slavery is a violation, by law, of liberty. The protective tariff is a violation, by law, of property. It is a most remarkable fact that this double legal crime ‚Äî a sorrowful inheritance from the Old World ‚Äî should be the only issue which can, and perhaps will, lead to the ruin of the Union. It is indeed impossible to imagine, at the very heart of a society, a more astounding fact than this: The law has come to be an instrument of injustice. And if this fact brings terrible consequences to the United States ‚Äî where the proper purpose of the law has been perverted only in the instances of slavery and tariffs ‚Äî what must be the consequences in Europe, where the perversion of the law is a principle; a system?‚Äù",0,0,Yellow/Blue _Austrian Watchman,GqoEs4cG6Uw,0.0435064935064935,2019-07-24 07:31:22,True,True

Tubman was an abductor, returning to the South to rescue people out from slavery. She easily could have been returned to slavery.    Beyond that, Tubman was a nurse, philanthropist, soldier and spy. Late in the war of rebellion she masterminded and led a Union raid on a huge plantation, which the soldiers torched and rescued 750 people.    She was a true American, a true patriot, and a real hero. Get rid of Jackson, the white supremacist slaveholder who caused the deaths of 10,000 Native Americans from the Trail of Tears.

2019-07-31T21:22:29,Ms. Harriet Tubman is one of the most patriotic daughters America has ever produced and unlike many legends her legend is true.  She earned the respect of bounty hunters who could not capture her or her keep.  She earned the respect of military officials by accomplishing missions behind enemy lines and returning safely to the other side.  She did all of this in a time when women were regarded as little more than children and enslaved Africans regarded as property.

I have a black musician Jimi Hendrix as my profile picture, and there are many more reasons why ‚Äúblack‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite‚Äù are indifferent, and there are great people among all ethnicities and backgrounds, and also terrible people from each as well. But sometimes I really do think, what if slavery didn‚Äôt exist? What if the Europeans had just left the Africans alone for the entire historical era of colonizing America? Hell, even before that, if they didn‚Äôt tie people up like dogs and force labor upon them, anywhere. What difference would it have done? Africa, would still be Africa. I doubt America would have progressed as fast without such a vast amount of free labor, but some of the most terrible things were necessary for the eventual improvement of society; both in terms of direct influence on culture, and the overall moral sensitivity of the globe. Without slavery, America would be all whites/ natives/ Mexicans. Perhaps with the African elite moving over here now, maybe. But think of the opportunity that the black youth now have because of the gradual holcocaust sent forth upon the unwilling Africans. It really is saddening, but the sacrifices forced into life and the ignorant european ambitions gave the African culture a step forward that they would have otherwise completely missed. I‚Äôm not for or against racism or slavery, it doesn‚Äôt concern me. But sometimes I do think about the course of history, and what everything else would be like should it have never happened. Moreover, what aspects of terrorism we can take and be grateful for. Not the typical way to think, but our intelligence is evolving, and I believe that every hideous thing that has happened to this beautiful civilization, was not without reason and just cause for the collective. As a whole, we are better for the shameful acts that we learned from. Be it directly or inderectly, stop subjectifying your own experience, and open your eyes to the objective.

2019-08-25T12:47:08,"There‚Äôs several pieces to read about Tubman. This preview is nothing like it. Everything is incorrect.  Her family has spoken out about her character and others.  Interesting stuff but a hero she was not.  Desperate and afraid. Shamed and tired. She struggled through the entire journey.  The hero‚Äôs were the people that took them in along the railroad that vested nothing to the law and spite the consequences opened there homes and assisted in the journey.  Those that directly helped these slaves , some were found out and the families were killed.  The Brennons were one family three generations and were killed when the neighbors ratted them out. Gunned down in the home and left.  Remember the Underground Railroad was created by homes along the way north.  The Slave trade was a policy commissioned to keep up with the rest of the world as Spain had 200 years of enslaving Africans to which our Democrats pushed on policies to help bolster the economy to which it did.  Once established the economy  would rely on and eventually be decimated if the Democrats deviated from these policies.  The Republicans were outnumbered in legislation to abolish slavery for over a century. These signatures can be read to this day to anyone willing to look at.  Once the word was out about the Underground Railroad the DC Democrats created what they called ‚Äúthe long arm of justice‚Äù to which later was named the Ku Klux Klan to hunt down these slaves on the railroad and kill anyone helping them.  These logged memos are still available to read.  Those whom read this can get mad or deny this truth but this is coming from a Democrat Liberal that has recently denounced the party.

They are all part of the European Union countries in all United States citizens are over every company on American soil teaching you that you came from somewhere the Bible States you are from here and have always been here in the land of milk and honey the garden of Eden the whole continent is America not the United States of America which is a foreign company that they don't even lie to you that has United States citizens that are in leadership positions to control the Indigenous Original American Indian Israelite that's why they shoot you and get away with it that's why they lock you in prison and they're not even even your peers they are not even from here you are the Americans they are United States citizens don't be confused misled or indoctrinated to believe otherwise.,0,0,Daud El Bey,GqoEs4cG6Uw,-0.010897435897435897,2019-09-16 07:57:30,True,True

These pilgrims have launched a silent war against they putting you all in prison and in poverty do your research all the sellout Indians keep telling you that you are black when you are not you are the two white men and women of the land because white/ means first people of the land they are only called white people over here in your mother land stop being children you know the root cause of your mental enslavement stop casting spells on yourself be the Americans here in Israel and Yudah America is the old world all anthropologist and historical writers have told you this including the Bible you are already home you are the Americans and they are not if they live in China and was born in the Chinese will not call them Chinese they will tell them to their face we don't care if you're born here you can't be us an we need to do the same check these immigrants that can come and go as they please because they have pale skin tone and we get harassed for traveling the roads that our ancestors build believe that we live in foreign company/country called the United States of America that uses forgien company money called fiat frn's federal reserve notes ....etc Knowing damn well the American Constitution states only gold and silver coins as money or money that's printed from the United States Treasury the United States Treasury does not print any money only the Federal reserve this tells you that they are immigrantsand you can shut all that s*** down hold them accountable if you just be who you're supposed to be your the Americans you have a Constitution a contract a treaty with them however they don't even post the American Constitution anymore they only post the United States Constitution do your research that are immigrants and the people that look like you all throughout the Americas even though they speak some type of Latin they or broken English they are Americans Indians Israelites to. you are nations there military Is not called the American military its called the United States army the United States Marines the United States Navy the United States air Force the United States supreme Court the United States this the United States that because they're all immigrants you're the Americans wake the f****** up stop being children and stop praying to others gods Ezekiel 37:4 and judge with a pure heart as you where instructed Psalms 82.

Slowly, one group at a time, she brought relatives with her out of the state, and eventually guided dozens of other slaves to freedom. Traveling by night and in extreme secrecy, Tubman (or ""Moses"", as she was called) ""never lost a passenger"".After the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed, she helped guide fugitives farther north into British North America, and helped newly freed slaves find work. Tubman met John Brown in 1858, and helped him plan and recruit supporters for his 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry.    When the Civil War began, Tubman worked for the Union Army, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy. The first woman to lead an armed expedition in the war, she guided the raid at Combahee Ferry, which liberated more than 700 slaves.""   So, yeah, she was badass.

Stating that she'd assisted enslaved people to freedom, makes her one-dimensional.  This extraordinary woman made these journeys during winter months (dark nights and cold elements provided the perfect cover.) Illiteracy didn't stop her from being a cook, nurse, spy and human compass. She was enslaved, beaten, robbed and not justly paid for her war efforts and contribution.

I've seen reports that she is big on calling us calling us Akata. Which is not a compliment.

Our ancestors was slaves over here they worked built this country. When they became free they fought for our rights. Everybody but us is getting those rights. That Nigerians bring they black behind over here and expect to get the rights of our ancestors fought for. And their ancestors was a great big of the Atlantic slave trade.

When they did Roots on prime tv, there was shade thrown to white students and some fights in school against white kids because of roots. Slavery was a very very very horribly time period in the lives of Africans and descendants from Africans until slavery ws abolish and then afterward and still today, based on the color one's skin. This movie is going to make many feel hurt, angry, inferior, negative, the N-word will be used quite often (maybe) it was the time and it was what white people called them. This form of slavery was economic business and white men lost a lot of money because of the abolishment of slavery.   This movie will touch on a lot of things about that time period and I hope to God there are no riots upsets in any community in the USA, depending on where this movie will be shown.

Point is a quote from Janet Jackson rhythm nation album, "" In Complete Darkness we are all the same , it is only our knowledge and wisdom that separates us . . . . Dont let your eyes deceive you "" . I take great pride in seeing that FINALLY a movie with a strong female of historic proportions, has been made.

We all need to see this movie and REEDUCATE our priorities . Ppl today always complain about frivolous shit, my phone,  my car, my hair , my J's, my house, my status, my my my my my my .

Araminta/Harriet's escape... Her value decreased because of her health issues. Brodress offered a hundred dollar reward if Araminta/Harriet was caught outside Maryland.  If she was caught within the state of Maryland, the reward was fifty dollars.  Araminta/Harriet and her siblings were  ""free""  who was actually held captive and regularly beaten by their ""owners""... Araminta/Harriet had learned that her¬† mother and father were free due to their indentureship had been fulfilled at age 45... when the ""owner"" died,  Harriet left and wasn't missed for some time...¬† she was usually hired out to tend to babies/little children of whites in the surrounding area, hunting and gathering game... she'd be gone for weeks at a time.  Description of Araminta/Harriet... very dark skinned, short...five ft. in height, missing two front teeth and petite in body. Araminta/Harriet also had brain surgery performed on her sometime in the 1890s to help alleviate the pain and suffering she was enduring.... nothing in the records show the surgery helped her.  She died in 1913 at the home for the sick, disabled, aged (which she founded) .  Her deeds...

Myth:¬†Harriet Tubman carried a rifle on her UGRR rescue missions Fact:¬†Harriet Tubman carried a small¬†pistol¬†with her on her rescue missions, mostly for protection from slave catchers, but also to encourage weak-hearted¬† runaways from turning back and risking the safety of the rest of the group.¬†Tubman carried a sharp-shooters rifle during the Civil War.

No. Teach it because even when I was growing up I know there was edits. There are books that should be apart of the curriculum that weren‚Äôt.  Black history is not something you can teach in one year with a few classes. It needs to be taught each year. Also there is a lot left out when it comes to post slavery as well. Some white people that don‚Äôt understand racism need to learn the ramifications of slavery, post slavery, Jim Crow,  Civil Rights Movement, crack epidimic and systemic ghettos and how that birthed hip hop. Yes hip hop is a valid culture. I hear a lot of white people say that black history is apart of ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù history yet are dismissive when it comes to killings of black children and men in 2019, claim that systemic ghettos aren‚Äôt really conducive to racism and dismiss hip hop as a culture and think it‚Äôs okay to use the ‚Äún‚Äù word because they think it‚Äôs cute.

She broke the law of the USA by taking slaves (property of their owners) from the United States into Canada even though it was illegal to do so (Fugitive Slave Act of 1850), she did this from 1850-1860 from what I have read. The United States Supreme Court had already ruled that slavery was a constitutional right in the Dred Scott case (1857). New York City draft riots (1863) is also an interesting read. The Civil War (Lincoln‚Äôs War), when taught in schools, does not mention the Morrill Tariff, Corwin‚Äôs Amendment, Taney Arrest Warrant or that during the Civil War the Lincoln Administration and Arbitrary Arrests ‚Äì at least 14,401 civilians were arrested by the Lincoln administration. Or that the Emancipation Proclamation, freed zero slaves? That is right, not even the ones in the Union.       John Brown was another law breaker of the USA. He was defeated by US Marines (1859). He was tried, convicted, and executed by hanging on December 2, 1859, in Charles Town, Virginia. This was of course before any State split from the United States due to the Morrill Tariff and not slavery since remember what I mentioned earlier, the United States Supreme Court had already ruled that slavery was a constitutional right in the Dred Scott case (1857).

After the Civil War, many blacks moved north in hopes of ""getting away"" from hatred. The reality is that the north wasn't exactly ""fans"" of black people either. Lincoln himself didnt really care about slavery during the Civil War. A quote from him: ""If i can win the war by freeing the slaves, i would do it. If i can win the war without freeing the slaves, i would do it."" Lincoln only cared when he realized the political advantage of it. Britain and France was very close to assisting the Confederacy in 1861 and 1862. Lincoln announced the Proclamation STRICTLY because it would make the British and French back out (since they already abolished slavery before the war.)

It's actually kind of comical how hard filmmakers pander to the black community these days and it's even funnier how the black community just eats it up like a stupid little fat kid.    There's a reason why no other nation on Earth obsesses over their histories of enslavement like Americans do, and that's because you all _don't want to_ get over slavery. You want to keep being victims because that's your whole identity at this point and it's become a way of life, complete with its own little consumerist economy and media to back it up.   But even more than that, you don't want to be truly free because that would mean you'd have to find something else to justify your existence apart from 'the good fight' against 'your oppressors'. And maybe that's why white and Asian people keep doing so much better in life than black people: because they're not busy 'struggling' against some imaginary enemy and that gives them time to  focus on actual problems like not having enough money.

I don't know how much names were changed in the movie, but I have often felt if that was something involving nine white American children in the 1950s, or eight white and one ""non-white"", there would have been a movie made about what they endured every 12 to 15 years coming out of Hollywood.  There must be something to do with permission, because Spike Lee made a movie about the four girls killed in the Alabama church, and I'm really surprised he hasn't opted to make a movie about the Little Rock Nine.  I know one of the kids has passed away, but that has always been the way Hollywood does it, so they don't have to pay out royalities; they wait for everyone involved to die.  But this movie comes near forty years after the tv miniseries with Cicely Tyson, and that is generally also how Hollywood does it; usually the copyright or something is up every thirty years, but this one was clearly stretched to forty.

PLEASE READ.    #NotMyHarriet     Sheesh, where do we begin with this movie lol. For starters, we as American descendants of slaves would like to see American actors represented SPECIFICALLY in these historical films.     Recently, Lupita Nyong'o got critical acclaim and catapulted her career by playing an American slave in '12 years of slavery'  & Chiwetel Oyelowo had a lead role in the same film playing an American slave. Then, in 2014 David Oyetokunbo played Martin Luther King in 'Selma' and  Carmen Elizabeth Ejogo played Coretta Scott King in the same film. Daniel Kaluuya is scheduled to star in the Fred Hampton biopic which has not been released yet. (https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/02/daniel-kaluuya-fred-hampton-biopic/ ). This has to change. People are beginning to reject the notion that black American entertainment can be at the forefront globally, but for whatever reason can't produce any black American actors good enough to play themselves?     For the most part, conscious black Americans did not enjoy any of the films that I just mentioned. Primarily because they do not feel an attachment to the performance by these foreign actors on screen. The actor's performance is subpar (despite the industry accolades) because they themselves do not carry the generational trauma of American slavery and Jim Crow in their DNA, they just get to capitalize off of it .     Now, moving on to the film itself. The main antagonist in the film is a fictional character named 'Bigger Long'. His entire motivation throughout the plot line is to win bounties so that he can afford "" white whores"". For emphasis, I will remind you that this is a fictional character. If a black man even dreamt about telling another white man that he plans on having sex with a white woman, they would hang his ass up on a tree, castrate him publicly, and do the same to every son that he bears thereafter. It is simply made up. not only did this character not exist, but the entire notion of black bounty slave catchers is also fictional, and is not documented from an historical point of view. So they're rewriting history to paint the picture of a black man being the one who is trying to catch Harriet Tubman and turn her into slavers so that he can collect payment and f*** white women. üôÑ. Lol. Let's not even touch on the absolutely obvious subconscious programming involved in a black man named BIGGER LONG looking to FUCK WHITE GIRLS. I'll just let that marinade a second lol. (By the way, Bigger's character is played by an ADOS black man, of course)    And last but not least, Cynthia Erivo. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. There are the tweets that she made in 2013 mocking ADOS' (Ghetto American Accent). She's retweeted Luvie Ajayi who has also had some controversial viewpoints slash comments towards American descendants of slaves, she has even retweeted tweets that claim American descendants of slaves are jealous of Africans. I've even heard rumors that her family is of the 'real born' Diala people in the Osu caste system. They were slave owners right? So a non-american actor who thinks black people are jealous of Africans, who literally has the DNA of black slavers in her blood is now playing Harriet Tubman. We just won't accept that.",3,1,Joshua Tellington,GqoEs4cG6Uw,0.05613006396588488,2019-11-08 22:40:59,False,True

2019-11-11T09:19:46,"Initially, I was very happy to hear that a movie was going to made about one of the most important and prominent historical figures in our history. But I was quickly disappointed to learn that the movie was a mere reflection of falsifications from the imaginations of the writers, producers and directors, as oppose to their relying on the evidence of pure historical facts. All the while resting on traditional racial prejudicial narratives against Black men, with arguably the most violent person in the movie being a bounty hunter i.e. ""slave tracker"", who was Black (and a historically non-existent, invented character),  who tried to capture the character Harriet, for her return to slavery, and then tries to kill her near the movie's end. But his attempt was stopped in the nick of time by Harriet's former White slave owner, also an invented character, who saves Harriet's life. The aforementioned is only a portion of the lies in this movie, and there was not a void of the many levels of fiction and historical inconsistencies. While they were at it, had the writers thought to make the character Harriet played by a White woman, she would not have been in strange company, given the many liberties the writers took in making the numerous fictitious characters and story lines that came to play with the central star of the film. At the conclusion of the movie, a patron in the theater loudly exclaimed words along the lines of, ""You teenagers need to go and write a book report !!!"" People responded in laughter. Had any of the teenagers taken this advise from this older patron, and had done a book report solely on the content of this movie, they would have undoubtedly received an ""F"", if the report were to be graded only on the merit of historical facts regarding Harriet Tubman's life. So, here is what I would suggest: Teenagers, this film's portrayal of Harriet Tubman'd life is highly fictionalize, and has some elements of truth that is exceptionally marginal in comparison to what is not true. Sadly to say, you may find Wikipedia a more credible resource, or might lead you to more credible resources. I would suggest for your book report, that you obtain your information about Harriet Tubman's life from non-fiction books,  records, and qualified historians of Black American history, and Harriet Tubman's life in particular.  Most importantly,  make sure that you do your due diligence in verifying the correctness of the information you learn.",4,0,n t,GqoEs4cG6Uw,0.10550200437317785,2019-11-11 09:19:46,False,True

But I didn't want to see it at the theater because of being white and not knowing if anger at white people would be directed at me. So, I waited for the movie to come out on DVD. Loved this movie so much! Harriet Tubman was one tough lady. They just don't make people like her anymore. We are all consumed with selfishness. She risked her life to save her people.
