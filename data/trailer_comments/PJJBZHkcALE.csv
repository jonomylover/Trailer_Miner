2014-12-04T21:31:20,"Here are my thoughts: I hate the cast. It looks like they just took a bunch of big names to bring in a bigger audience and desperately tried to make them look like the original actors but just didn't succeed. I especially hate the actress they chose for Sarah, she's hot, but she's way younger than Sarah in the original, she's also not a particularly good actor. As for the guys that plays future John Connor, he's been in fucking everything, I mostly remember him from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. However, they put a scar on him similar to the scar on future John from the beginning of T2, so that I like. Now granted, Arnold is old, but I'm not gonna blame that on them, what the fuck are they supposed to do about that? You complained about no Arnold in Salvation, here he is in Genisys, and now you're whining about him being too old. Make up your minds. I'm happy they brought him back. I also thought it was badass how we see him fighting his younger-ish self as a different terminator, I really wanna see that shit! Although it seems weird how he's like ""I've been waiting for you"" like a hero who wants vengeance even though Terminators can't want vengeance because they have no emotions. ""Desire is irrelevant. I am... a machine!"" It did however look cool how after Kyle Reese comes back, it looks exactly like the first Terminator how he runs into the clothing store from the cops and everything, and I also like that twist about how that cop is actually a T-1000 and Sarah has the car crashing into the building, that looked both cool and original, finally something fresh and new. Although, anyone else notice that the truck Sarah crashes into the building is the same truck Arnold crashes into the Skynet building with the SWAT team in it in T2? Idk if that's just coincidence or how she got the truck, but whatever. Still cool. I also thought the bus flipping over thing seemed pointlessly over-the-top. The CGI looks like how CGI would look in a TV show. That's disappointing. T-1000 looks good though. I also liked how the T-1000 was attached to the hood of the car in that one scene when he was detaching from it, that was cool and it looked pretty fucking good. Although, one thing that bothers me is that the T-1000 doesn't look as scary or creepy as the T-1000 in T2 did. Am I the only one who finds it kinda weird that the T-1000 is Asian?

2014-12-04T21:54:44,"A few of my personal, yes.. Personal thoughts based on this Trailer. Not that it means much, the movie is pretty well finished.  I very much preferred the futuristic look to Salvation. It managed to recreate the scene from T2 - They nailed the grim, dark, futuristic look from the earlier installments, and kept the scar of John Connor consistent from the beginning scene of Judgement Day.   Salvation was leagues better than T3, IMHO.  This, however, the future doesn't look nearly as ""Real"" as Salvation, looks like something out of a sci-fi series made for TV.  Though my biggest complaint is the casting role for Sara Connor. I have yet to even watch Game of Thrones, and I know exactly who that actress is, and I'm sorry that she doesn't fit the role of Sara whatsoever.  Her line delivery was over-the-top tryhard cheesy, trying way too hard to be a badass. I feel as though she'll likely ruin this movie for me. The role for Kyle seems quite legit, a little better than Salvation I would say.  Great to see Arnold back, though. Still, horrible, horrible choice for Sara Connor.

First, this could mean that they actually will never be able to stop judgement day, cause Kyle would still have to go to the correct time eventually, somehow, and impregnate Sarah with John. Which would mean it literally becomes an endless loop.  This brings up my second possibility. As, Kyle has to go back in time in order impregnate Sarah with Connor. But, if he was sent back to the time period after the first terminator,  but before the third, John would have never been born because Kyle never would have met Sarah,  and she would have been killed, in the first movie. With John never being born the army would have never been created, and Kyle would have never been able to be sent back, canceling Johns mistake of sending him to the wrong time period and causing the Timeline to A) Reset itself or B) Continue with skynet taking over without trouble. Whitch would eliminate everything that happened in the first four movies. Im really interested to see how this all plays out and I cant wait to see it.

2014-12-05T01:03:45,"Ok, on the timeline: The original terminator has an Austrian accent because he was built using the body model of what would have been a real life person. Skynet's facility snatched people and grew the organic parts required around the machine skeleton. The human model was probably Austrian, so the accent and vocal chords we're a matched set. The T-1000 was never white to begin with, he replicated the first human he encountered after time traveling to LA, a white cop. And the new T-1000 looks a damn lot like Robert Patrick, the original T-1000, so thats a plus.  As for stopping Skynet causing no terminators, which causes no Kyle Reese going back in time which causes no John Conner from being born to stop Skynet (insert loop here), once you go back in time (if that were possible), you become part of that timeline. You can change things, which change YOUR future, as you see it, and can even stop other things from having had happened (future past tense time travel grammar), but it's from your point of view. You are the only one who knows things happen differently, because you jumped timelines. The only way to even remotely alter a future you're still part of would be if the means of time travel were an bridge between the two points in time, which was left open while you went back. ",0,0,Robert Patterson,PJJBZHkcALE,0.03953962703962704,2014-12-05 01:03:45,True,True

2014-12-05T12:30:30,"Disappointed.  I wasn't going to comment on this trailer, but I've watched it several times and had several more beers (minus 0.5  beers for my homies).  While the quantum phenomenon of nonlocality has presented evidence of a physical reality in which actions in the present can influence the state of the past (as in Yakir Aharonov's TSVF entanglement theory), the idea that one could travel backward in time to an entirely different past is not something easily reconciled.   The only explanation would seem to be that John Connor (immediately after sending Kyle Reese to 1984) said ""Oh, snap!  I've got an even better idea.  I'll reprogram one of these cyborgs and send it back to when my mom was a kid.""  But even that wouldn't work.  The past that Reese would end up in would always have to be consistent with the future that he left.  If time were a river (a terrible analogy, but adequate in this context), flowing in one direction (as time does for most people), diverting the flow at any one point will affect all the water passing that point from then on.  However you could never travel upstream and find yourself at a point through which the river had never flowed.  Branching realities work in a similar way:  Assuming you could go back in time and kill baby Hitler (if you wanted to, baby killer), once you did you could never get back to the future that you knew because that future no longer exists on your timeline.  Likewise, you could never travel from the future to a present where Terminator Salvation was never made (as badly as you may want to) because that present never existed on your timeline (thanks a mopful, McG).  While the possibility of infinite parallel realities does exist in theory, the premise of traveling back in time and finding yourself in one of those realities is ridiculous.  Such an idea would turn every Terminator movie into a crap-shoot, where Kyle Reese could just as easily have been sent into a past in which the Earth itself never existed.  Similarly, the T-1000 from T2 could have wound up in a past in which the old CSM-101 from the first Terminator movie had killed every Sarah and/or John Connor in the world, leaving a Robert Patrick-looking lonely lump of mimetic poly-alloy (liquid metal) with nothing to do.  There are so many options available within the range of reason, one could be forgiven for wondering wtf is going on.  All great science fiction stories are written around a kernel of possibility.  It's true that most of those stories inevitably self-destruct due to lack of vision, but the first two Terminator movies didn't.  The first film was a genre-straddling work of art that could have stood alone forever.  It was an action movie with the classic horror theme of Frankenstein, placing a (closed timelike curve of a) love story at the heart of it all.  It was epic storytelling combined with ground-breaking special effects (I *heart* Stan Winston) and it didn't need a sequel at all.  The second film was a perfectly executed action movie, but it also aspired to be much more.  It hinted at the possibility of some kind of reconciliation between what we are and what we might try to define ourselves as to future generations.  ""Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.""  If a machine can learn that, why can't movie producers understand the value of quality storytelling?  Why couldn't we just wait for James Cameron to make another Terminator film?  Why are we watching a trailer for what seems to be an amalgamation of the first two Terminator movies with pieces of the last two thrown in?  Why can't we see something new?   It could be more interesting to observe a future in which John Connor never really existed.  The name could have been used as a nom de guerre by whatever person was in charge.  If that person were killed, the next in line could simply take up the moniker and continue to inspire the resistance.  This would mean that Skynet would end up chasing a ghost--not unlike Keyser Söze (or Osama Bin Laden, for all you conspiracy buffs, and Goldstein for all the Orwellians)--wasting resources trying to kill someone they'll never be able to find.  Better yet, have a film introduce a pure, uncorrupted timeline in which Kyle Reese is not the father of John Connor.  The last three Terminator movies have shown the human race to be dependent on repurposing the very technology built to destroy it.  Rather than make the same movie again, why not show the audience that it wasn't the benefit of knowledge from the future, but the indomitable will and spirit of humanity that allowed us to rise up and smash those metal mf'ers into junk.  Maybe the original father of John Connor was just some d-bag that hooked up with Sarah and never called her back.  After that, the mother of humanity's saviour could have developed a deep distrust of people and taught her son to protect himself from a-holes without becoming one.  After the bombs fell, he could have just used what she taught him to fight machines rather than people.  Then we could have seen Kyle Reese really distinguish himself and earn the responsibility (and the reward) of being sent back to save J.C.'s mother.  And if it is absolutely essential to use time travel as a plot device, conceive a future in which Kyle Reese is killed before he could be sent back in time.  Kill him off right at the start of the movie, then have John Connor actually create the time displacement equipment and send himself back in time repeatedly to save his father.  Then we could watch a whole platoon of John Connors occupying the same time period, kicking ass, taking names (or, letters dash numbers) and commiserating about their collective destiny and how none of them ever wanted any part of it.    Maybe John Connor could play some vital role in creating Skynet in the past (Terminator 6: Poor Judgment Day).  Maybe someone could be sent back in time to stop humans from trying to pull the plug when Skynet becomes self-aware, thus averting the deaths of many real and artificial people (Terminator 7: Deplomizy).  There are literally an infinite number of storylines that could have been generated based on the concepts introduced by the original film.  Why make a movie using a plot that makes no sense and the same gags that made the last two films in the franchise boring?  We've all seen explosions and we've all seen vehicles flip over.    Why not show us something new?  What if, this time, after he says ""I'll be back"", he doesn't come back?  That would be a new.  Actually, why not leave Schwarzenegger out of it completely?  It may seem sacrilegious to have a Terminator movie without the original Terminator, but why would Skynet make so many Governator model terminators?  The whole concept of the terminator is based on infiltration.  To mass produce identical models defeats the entire purpose.  John Connor should be able to work with a sketch artist and create posters with captions reading ""KNOWN TERMINATOR: SHOOT ON SIGHT"" or ""DON""T LET THIS GUY IN.""  The desire to see a familiar face is understandable, but the idea of a new order of intelligence thinking like a movie producer strains credulity.  The most frustrating part of all of this is the fact that, unless the world ends in the next year, I know I'm going to pay money to see this movie.  While I'm still optimistic, I can't help feeling that I'm going to be disappointed.  But, maybe the future is not set.  Maybe that's just the fate I've chosen for myself...",2,0,Michael Couchie,PJJBZHkcALE,0.0677911419388692,2014-12-05 12:30:30,True,True

2015-01-02T05:06:53,"I can understand where there are many criticisms with this. I am mixed about this, but will go see this just to see how this went or what got them there? However I do find the over use of CGI when blending some CGI, more makeup and animatronics like in T2 is in all honesty a better direction, because it gives the audience something real. when Arnold takes off his arm in T2 the effects were simple by today's standards and still holds up.  Let's be honest some of the CGI looked pretty cartoonish but that could be preproduction that has not been fully finished or them being cheap.  As for those who criticize fans complaining, you can't really blame them since how would you like it if say Michael Bay took something you loved growing up, does not follow the source material and ignores the key fan audience? If say a live action Transformers movie where Optimus Prime transformed into a 1984 Freightliner Cabover, had a better script and set in 1984, you would probably have a better chance at positive reception among fans. When you stray away from the source material it can easily upset fans and don't see the excuse to yell at people complaining? When you yell at people it makes you a hypocrite since you yourself  would complain if something you cherished was revamped into something that strayed away from the source material.  I hate Twilight and the overhype of poor writing, but would not yell at the fans of Twilight if they complained if a move strayed away from the books by taking out the characters being vampires and making tem something else.   ",0,0,Lieutenant Yoshi,PJJBZHkcALE,0.19077134986225897,2015-01-02 05:06:53,True,True

In those two movies, Arnold was cold as ice (but sometimes funny), Eddie Furlong was funny, and Linda Hamilton was primal and raw. But this? Terminator 5 just looks to be another empty sequel running on auto-pilot. I probably won't be spending my money on this. It's a shame though.

2015-01-30T01:12:41,"Interesting plot twist, sure. But this doesn't make sense. I'll try to make some sense of it.  Okay, Terminator is about the 800 series creating a paradox where John doesn't exist in the future by killing Sarah. Kyle impregnates her. Whatever.  Judgement Day is about the T1000 killing the now living John Connor to prevent him from doing something in the future to win the war against the machines. The resistance sends an EXACT copy of the 800 sent to kill his mother to rescue his past self unless the machines are making a surplus of Arnie Bots (which is counter productive to the whole infiltration thing).   In the third, they send a TX to try to kill John and the resistance sends ANOTHER Arnie Bot! They protagonists try to prevent Skynet from going online and fail. Arnie becomes a martyr again. The End.  The fourth! It's about John subsisting the full circle by preventing Kyle's death. John nearly dies by the hands of an obligatory Arnie Bot.  This is what I don't understand. In what fashion is John's past a necessity? You could say that it would create a time paradox but I haven't seen anything in any of the movies that suggests that would happen. The Johns and Sarahs that they're saving aren't them!  Also, how hard is for the machines it to kill the pertinent targets? Arnie could have easily killed both Sarah and Kyle shortly before they're taken into police custody; Instead, the Arnie Bot runs! Why couldn't they send bots to the moment Sarah gets institutionalized and immediately kill John when he's vulnerable? Perhaps when he's eight and doesn't have a dirt bike? They're so bad at killing the necessary people!  And again, why are there so many Arnie Bots!? They apparently made adjustments to the other bots; The T1000 isn't Bob Pat!  I know, it's an action movie. But the thing is that the first two TRIED to be innovative. This is why they have fewer holes in the plot. They weren't trying to make a dumb action movie. I know, it's all for the sake of making the story work. But there has to be better ways to do this!  That said, I'm probably gonna see this regardless.

I just hope they make it rated R tho .... Please make it R. Everything should be rated R. What can you possibly not show younger viewers that they don't know already ?!?!?!? I bet u anything you hide young audiences probably know and seen it already .  Please make it rated R and don't destroy the terminator franchise... Some of it has been destroyed already so at least make it R for us to be pleased and satisfied !!!!!,0,0,Gilbert Espino,PJJBZHkcALE,0.2580213903743316,2015-02-04 17:34:34,True,True

From what I've seen she, she doesn't come across as strong and doesn't have the screen personality one expects for this part like a Linda Hamilton. This is huge one b) Arnold as Terminator is the only bright spot! c) Byung-hun Lee as the T-1000, I'll reserve judgement until I've seen the movie, but I don't have much hope d) Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese, I'm not holding my breath either e) Alan Taylot director not much excitement there either.
