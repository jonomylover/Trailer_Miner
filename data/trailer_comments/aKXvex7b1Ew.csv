2018-11-20T16:28:08,"The late 80's to early 90's had an entire stable of movies like this that ran from very good to just so-so. The plot was always about some obsessed psycho who couldn't let go, but was diabolical enough to always make the couple they were terrorizing look like the crazy ones. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, Cape Fear, Unlawful Entry, Deceived, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, The Temp, The Crush, Guilty as Sin, Single White Female, Sleeping With the Enemy, The Good Son, A Kiss Before Dying, Body of Evidence, and many more all had the common plot of a person with a dark past, but a seemingly normal facade who insinuates themselves into the lives of a couple or individual and begins to turn their lives into a living Hell. The motive was usually one of two things; They were either a stalker who was just fixated on the person such as in The Crush, or Single White Female, or they had some twisted personal reason such as in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.   The Intruder looks to borrow ideas from all of these films, especially Pacific Heights (which is excellent!). Younger audiences who didn't grow up with these movies might see the idea as fresh and not see the plot twists coming. Those of us who did already know how this will play out, much of which is already revealed in the trailer.

The couple see the guy as very friendly, nice, and lonely so they do not bother to question or do any digging around about him. As time progresses, the guy does things that cross the line and are innapropriate. The couple, but especially the wife, brush these things off and make alternate explanations for the weird behavior until about the last 30 minutes of the movie where the villains real motive is uncovered and a suspenseful chase/fight/action scene takes place where the couple fights the villain for their lives and ultimately win. They will somehow escape him, possibly by injuring him, running him over with a car, or some other form of revenge. The closing scene will either show that the villain has died and the movie will end on that or show something else that ends with uncertainty as to the whereabouts of the villain.
