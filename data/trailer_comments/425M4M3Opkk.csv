Re-vamps don't add to the source material, they just tire out a good thing. They stretch the story out beyond it's bounds, warping it, tearing it, and then they fill in the holes with horrid stock hollywood plots like the good little boy now works for the boring miserly megacorp and has to bring love back into the world. And for the record the source material is the books by A. A. Milne, not the simultaneously watered down and overly saccharine animated Disney version. Wow, I just irritated myself with my own self righteous indignation. Carry on with your fun and nostalgia, don't mind me.

I mean they at least kept that in the animation medium and tried their damndest to try and keep the same feeling as Many Adventures in that series even going as far to add some elements from the actual Meline books that didn't make it into Many Adventures, but I will say as pointless as I think this is I still don't think it's as pointless as Lion King, which is just going to be cgi on live action backgrounds it's no different than when Disney animated the film Dinosaur which did the same thing back in the 2000s, all they're doing with the Lion King is just animating a film that's already animated. Good crap I cannot wait until the Nostalgia Critics Disney Live action month so he can rip these pointless sell-out films a new one and I encourage him to do it again once every announced live action adaption is out of the way because as many as Disney is doing it pretty much gives Doug plenty of material to work with for almost two or three years to have a Disney live action month, seriously I see it as pointless because I highly doubt Disney is hurting for money, honestly I'm probably OK with stuff that came out in the Disney dark/bronze era that failed or anything not named or related to Fantasia that actually came out when Walt himself was alive but anything from the renaissance era from the 90's especially Little Mermaid-Lion King I really think do not need to be remade quite yet especially considering most Disney  renaissance films are less than 25 years old if I wanted to watch them I'd watch the original films considering you get the same experience watching them  today as you could when they were actually released during the Disney  renaissance of the 90's.",0,0,The #1 Yoshi,425M4M3Opkk,0.09506203617810759,2018-03-06 22:57:24,True,True

Felicity Jones as Kate Nahum, a magic shop owner, a witch in training, & Mack's wife 2. Benedict Cumberbatch as Mack, a local farmer, Sadie's father, Kevin's brother, & Kate's husband. 3. Simon Pegg as Kevin, a real estate who wants to close down Kate's magic shop, also Mack's brother & Sadie's uncle. 4. Millie Bobby Brown as Sadie, Mack's daughter & Kevin's niece. 5. Terence Stamp as Sergeant Nahum, Kate's late father. & it takes place in 1987 England. & I also think that Sam Raimi (Oz: The Great & Powerful) should direct, & David Henrie/Joe Roth both should produce it, & Max Landis (Victor Frankenstein) should write it.

2018-03-07T01:26:30,"Dear friends you may feel lonely and lost in this big world, but just know you are NEVER alone. Jesus Christ always have been and will always be with you on this earth. He is all around you, hovering over you even as you seek Him. He is nearer than you dare believe, closer than the air you breathe. If His children could only recognize His presence, they would never feel lonely again. Jesus knows every thought before you think it, every word before you speak it. His presence impinges on your innermost being. Can you see the absurdity of trying to hide anything from Him? You can easily deceive other people, and even yourself; but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whom loves you so much, can read you like an open book, large print.                                                                                                            Deep within themselves, most people have some awareness of Jesus imminent presence. Many people run from Him and vehemently deny His existence, because the closeness of Jesus terrifies them. But His own children have nothing to fear, for Jesus Christ have cleansed them by His blood and clothed them in His righteousness. Be blessed by His intimate nearness. Since Jesus lives in you, let Him also live through you, shining LIGHT into darkness. Become one with Christ by telling Him you will give you life to Him this very moment. Repent and as Him to forgive you of your sins. Believe in Him, have Faith in Him and allow Him to lead and guide you in EVERY aspect of your life. Jesus Christ's love for you can't be measured or described using mere words. It is deep, eternal, and special just for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (Psalm 139:1-4;  Ephesians 2:13;  2 Corinthians 5:21)",1,0,msdogooder,425M4M3Opkk,0.16267264481550198,2018-03-07 01:26:30,True,True

Milne and NOT Walt Disney! (The Disney corporation may have bought the rights to Winnie The Pooh, but they have balls deleting the authors name as they did with all of the brothers Grimm stories from Europe.) The Disney corporation has made a fortune stealing other peoples children's stories, that they made into 'Disney' movies. You can be sure if Disney ever wrote a children's story and some greedy corporation in Japan or China decided to make it into a movie, without stating that it was written by Disney, there would a jet full of lawyers, billing tens of thousand of dollars per hour, sent there the next day to stop the movie being released and suing them for damages and all of the profits! But when Disney does it, it's just the way it is and nobody says anything. And don't get me started on the endless slave labor camps across China and India, that pay poor children forced to work for a dollar a day that work 12 hours a day, seven days a week, making all of the overpriced Disney merchandise (clothing and toys) for all of those Disney movies.

2018-03-07T03:50:22,"Watching this trailer for the Christopher Robin movie has made me want to go see that whole wonderful movie because when I was a little kid, I used to have all of these Winnie-The-Pooh videos: Learning & Sharing. I also used to have this Pooh's Grand Adventure movie as a child, and when I put each one of those tapes into the VCR I would just watch quietly, plus I'd put in this Winnie The Pooh & Christmas Too movie, and, in my free time, while at home, I would watch this TV series on Playhouse Disney The Book Of Pooh. It's Disney Junior presently. Makes me wish it was Playhouse Disney again so I could relive the days of Winnie The Pooh. Even transitioning into my elementary school years to middle school years in 2007, I'd still watch Pooh-themed shows, including My Friends Tigger & Pooh. In 2003, I watched a movie called Piglet's Big Movie. In summer 2011, I went to go see Winnie-The-Pooh at a movie theater. I'm so glad to have found all of my childhood memories involving Pooh.

Pooh does look a bit weird but I suppose that's more a part of seeing him as an actual stuffed animal instead of animated like we're used to.  Also, thanks Jim Cumming's for continuing to voice Winnie the Pooh after all these years!  Your voice really gives a lot of heart and soul to the character!

2018-03-07T23:04:26,"I hope Owl doesn't narrate this. Otherwise he will go on and on about boring stories that nobody cares about. Speaking of boring, according to an article published in the journal¬†Motivation of Emotion, there are five types of boredom‚Äîwhich is one more than the research team expected to identify. The boredom varieties range from a calm and pleasant experience to something more like depression. The research team, led by¬†Thomas Goetz of the University of Konstanz and the Thurgau University of Teacher Education in Konstanz, Germany, collected real-time data from university and high-school students multiple times a day over a two-week period. They found that boredom is not only widespread‚Äîevery student in the study experienced some level of boredom‚Äîbut it's also more common than other emotions. ""Boredom is the most often and most intense emotion experienced by students,"" wrote Goetz in an email, ""much more intense than enjoyment, anxiety or anger."" Students reported if they were bored, answered questions about their positive or negative feelings, and rated how calm or fidgety they felt. From these reports the researchers identified five different types of boredom. They also found that tedium is personal. ""People tend to experience specific types of boredom,"" said Goetz, which could mean that boredom is linked to your personality. So, which type of boredom do you experience? Indifferent boredom¬†is is a pleasant form of boredom, said Goetz, giving as an example a student who has had a really long day. ""You go to a class, you are tired, and the class is boring. However, the boredom is experienced as rather relaxing and even positive. It is still boredom, but you like being bored."" Another example? Zoning out on the couch in front of a marathon of trashy reality TV. Do you let your thoughts wander? If you are open to new ideas but don't feel any motivation to actually get up and do something, that's calibrating boredom. ""It is like daydreaming,"" said Goetz, ""but not actively searching for new actions."" If you have ever responded to the question ""why did you do it?"" with ""because I was bored,"" you have possibly experienced searching boredom. People who experience searching boredom are highly motivated to find a more interesting activity. This type of boredom can lead to innocuous behavior like texting a friend, or may prompt violent or risky actions, explained Goetz. ""However, searching boredom can also result in highly creative and positive actions,"" he said. ""Thus, it is a big chance‚Äîit leads to actions."" Trapped in a boring lecture or never-ending meeting? You may be experiencing reactant boredom. When you can't change your circumstances‚Äîget up and leave the classroom or conference room‚Äîyour boredom may be accompanied by restlessness and aggression, along with the desire to do something else. ""You are bored, you can't leave the situations, and this goes in line with feelings of aggression,"" said Goetz. Apathetic boredom is a type of boredom that was a surprise to the researchers. The other types were first identified in a 2006 study that Goetz participated in, but apathetic boredom‚Äîa very unpleasant form of boredom accompanied by a lack of motivation‚Äîemerged from this recent research. It seems to be similar to depression, and it may have more negative consequences than other types. ""Apathetic boredom can be assumed to be detrimental for personal psychological health,"" Goetz said. Are there more ways to be bored out there? ""I don't think that there are further types of boredom,"" said Goetz, ""but let's see."" Anyways, yeah. Owl will just ramble. He will probably make the movie 5 hours long.",70,14,LeafyMeadow,425M4M3Opkk,0.02068755739210286,2018-03-07 23:04:26,True,True

2018-03-09T15:07:29,"Alright, to be fair, I think that this is an interesting enough concept for a movie; it sort of reminds me of Hook in a way, how a person with a fantasy-filled childhood reconnects and reconciles with it. And I think the lines and voice they gave to Winnie the Pooh are excellent.  But then again, I see two problems: one, which I also have with Hook, is that it looks like Christopher Robin will be the chlich√©d overworked father who doesn't spend enough time with his kids, which is old AF. The other is that Winnie the Pooh will give me nightmares. I mean, I see that they're portraying him as a living teddy bear, but he looks like he was taken from a David Lynch movie! Hell, Ted, an adult movie that came out 6 years ago, managed to make a living teddy bear adequately cute. Why couldn't this? Bottom line, I'm not really that interested, and I won't see it in  the cinema.

I feel like this could be the first truly great movie of the new live action versions of classic Disney movies. Why? All of the others so far have just been passable to okay rehashes of the animated counterparts (whether you like them or not). They didn't really do anything new with the material. This one doesn't seem to be out to 'fix' the old version, and it isn't out to act like it's more mature just because it's live action. It looks like it's going to take the new medium and use it to tell an aspect of the story that's genuinely mature and interesting. On the other hand, I question the design choice on Pooh. It is kinda creepy, especially how the mouth barely moves when it talks. But who knows, maybe they can pull it off.

2018-03-14T22:25:59,"It's weird that there are TWO live-action Pooh Bear movies and only one of them is made by Disney. When they come out, I would do a supercut of both of them titled ""Winnie the Pooh: Generations"" as it combines the past and presents. Changes will include:  A James Bond-style opening to the song ""House of Pooh Corner""  Additional footage from ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: The Story Behind the Masterpiece"", ""Winnie the Pooh and His Story Too"" and ""A Bear Named Winnie"" (mainly because I want to tell the story of Winnie and Pooh, if you know what I mean)  Narration and voice clips from ""Winnie the Pooh and His Story Too"" (expect Jim Cumming's voice coming out of classic Pooh aka Edward)  All young Christopher Robin footage from the Disney one and ""A Bear Named Winnie"" removed since we already have ""Goodbye, Christopher Robin"" for that  The end song from Japanese Spider-Man is added to the end credit as a dedication to A.A. Milne  My own take on the iconic winking Pooh scene (which I am the only one not freaked out by, for some reason)  A fun post-credit scene of your choice. It could be either a stop-motion conversation between Eeyore and Optimus or a IM-inspired one of Pooh meeting Paddington  A Paddington cameo with him meeting Winnipeg to romantic music  Alternate titles includes ""The Life and Times of Winnie the Pooh"" (inspired by ""The Life and Times of the Real Winnie-the-Pooh: The Bear that Inspired A.A. Milne""), ""The Further Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" (a alternate title for the Disney one), ""The Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" (a shorten version of the previous one), ""A Tale of Pooh"" (a pun on ""A Tao of Pooh"") or ""From Winnie to Pooh: The Story of Two Bears"" (again, going with the idea of telling the story of Winnie and Pooh).
