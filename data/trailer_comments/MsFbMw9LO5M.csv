This movie had too many plots, I don't understand what's actually going on. The jokes are forced all the time, and the comedy wasn't that funny. I thought that the characters were poorly written, and Tiffany Haddish 's character, Tanya, is one of those stereotypical ghetto women. Also, the part where Tanya tries to find a guy that's catfishing Danica, they had to use a two guys from the TV show ""Catfish"" on MTV. What was the point of having them in this film? Also, if Danica was told that she got catfished, she would have been upset, but she really needs to move on and forget about Charlie. I guess there were some parts that made me laugh a bit. What is 1 parts where Chris Rock says that he knows Kung Wheelie, and the part where Tanya said that she'll ""f-u-c-k some DNA u-p"". But anyways, I would have liked this movie more if the characters were more likeable and well-written.
