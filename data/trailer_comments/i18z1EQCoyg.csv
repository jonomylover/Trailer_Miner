(See ""whiskey rebellion"".  Farmers who resist a whiskey tax are finally put down by George Washington and his federal military.  If the second amendment myth about overthrowing oppression and perceived heavy taxation were true, shouldn't those farmer revolutionaries have been patriots?  American Heroes?  Shouldn't G. Washington have become the historical enemy to an American Republic?  Should there have been a tax on whiskey to begin with?  Why don't we side with the farmers?  Why aren't they American Heroes?  Through this filter, should a government have ever put its citizens into the place of demanding their second amendment rights to overthrow this oppressive government?  Shouldn't G Washington have rightly been overthrown by its own commitment to arm its citizens for times like these?  Or was the second amendment really about something else entirely?)  See Patrick Henry (anti federalist's) and his dialogue and correspondence with federalist's regarding volunteer slave patrols ""militias"" and the second amendment.  Southern states who were already reeling from laws making the international slave trade illegal... Abolitionists in the government and seeing more and more on the horizon, and now this new type of slave willing to bond together and revolt against its wealthy southern plantation owners.  Quite frankly the South were living in fear of a shit storm against their way of life.. when federalist's began to promote this idea of a stronger federal government.    The second Amendment is an appeasement of federalist's to anti federalist's who demanded their militias (slave patrols) the right to ""keep and bear arms"" specifically for this purpose of putting down slave revolts.  The federalist's sold out on this issue because they needed the help of some southern states to ratify the new constitution proposed.  (Real correspondence to be found as evidence for this)...  Slavery.  (Not revolution) is what the second amendment was about.  It's ok north western modern militia men hiding out in the forests and mountains.

As they swept through the countryside, Turner’s men freed slaves as they continued the killings. Upwards of 75 of them joined the uprising over the ensuing two days and killed dozens of whites. source: History Channel         Killing babies and innocent white sharecroppers???

2016-10-07T10:17:03,"The problem with people today is that when a black person brings up the racism; it is  said that he or she needs to let the past go. If this should ever ring to be true; then would it not also be wise for a white person to not teach their children those prejudice practices either? When a film is released with good white people from the past is it asked to be left there in the past? That answer would be no; the world has the right to know the whole truth. There will always be ignorance in the world, but the truth is that it is hard to place any blame anywhere. For how would you fare in today's society without being issued the correct tools? You'd probably not be as successful as one whom was given correct guidance.  The world is cruel and many people don't care until it hits home for them. Who cares when the young boys die at the hands of the police? . . . Not enough people right? But when the police die at the hands of the young men; it's an outrage across the country.  People of all backgrounds feel that pain; I've never seen so many black officers stand up on the podiums and speak to the media until then. Then to say hey become a part of the solution not the problem. I think the problem is the blind eye of those who don't see what's going on right in front of their faces until it hits home. We live in a world full of hatred and ignorance; as much as it hurts our children's future; WE ALL fail to recognize it. The same hurt that we feel when a white officer pulls the trigger on our young black men; we need to have those same feelings when we do this to one another. As people we should be raising our children black, white, Hispanic etc. . . To love all people no matter color or religious beliefs; so that they can live without as much worry and negativity.  I love my kids and hope that one day they too strive to be the best parents and role models to their children. Just being involved in your kids lives and allowing them to stay pure and innocent for as long as possible will help their future. We have to make sure that our households are in order here in America before we can assist in fixing any other part of the world.",85,16,Bad Timing,i18z1EQCoyg,0.1063433165473982,2016-10-07 10:17:03,False,True

It, along with the slave revolts and subsequent genocide of whites in Haiti, helped fuel anti-abolitionist attitudes and cause the Civil War. It was not an option to free a tiger that you had by the tail, as people believed. Any move in that direction terrified many southern whites, slaveholders or not. You can argue that it's slave propaganda as the source if you want, but apparently the order was to ""kill all white people"" and that's what they did. If you're gonna educate yourself, educate yourself right. Abolitionists in the north and south did not use events like Nat Turner's rebellion to argue for the freeing of slaves. It cemented a belief in the opposite. It's ironic that this movie names itself that.

We never should drown history, and we should always be skeptical as to what lens you are learning it from. Growing up (at least in my region of the Northwest) I was very lucky to have great teachers who taught us to the best of their abilities what REALLY happened. But that is not enough, we need to encourage our children to read for themselves and spend their own time learning... I wish I had more time to write but at the moment I do not. I will just end this by saying please... Please do not be just another wedge of division among human beings which every one of us is.

2017-06-21T16:25:30,"This is a biased movie about a very controversial individual.  The movie doesn't show Nate Turner and his partners killing children or old people.  One can argue that he was fighting against oppression and that it was slave owners' violence that made him snap.  Yet there's the fact that the movie portray him as being influenced by a passage of the Bible, which makes him a radical religious individual, very close to a Muslim Jihadist.  Okay. there was a lot of violence against black slaves back then, yet the movie claims that a passage of the Bible served as justification for his acts : that's religious extremist terrorism.  Let's talk about another movie now : The Last Samurai starring Tom Cruise. The movie came to being as the US  was fighting terrorists or terrorist sympathizers in Afghanistan. The Tom Cruise character goes to Japan, becomes a prisoner of the Japanese, falls in love with their ways, and then fights along the Japanese against American Troops. What does that make his character? The answer would be very close to the American Al-Qaeda, the white guy who was captured fighting among them.  I would say that, even though a lot of people can defend it as a work of art, this kind of movie is very, very dangerous since there's a lot of viewers who don't have the maturity of the knowledge of context in order to view it for what it is, a biased artistic interpretation of a historic event, and not as a piece of propaganda supporting extreme views and actions.",0,1,Mottahead,i18z1EQCoyg,0.08906666666666667,2017-06-21 16:25:30,False,False

Deeply religious, Nat saw a solar eclipse earlier that year in February, much like the one we will see today, as a sign from God to rise up and revolt against every slave-owning family that crossed their path in Southampton County, Virginia.

An estimated 55 men, women, and children were killed in the rebellion."" The rebellion only lasted 48 hours as it was quickly suppressed. Afterwards, while Turner was in hiding, an estimated 200 slaves were murdered in revenge for the rebellion. Nat Turner was soon captured and hung, but his actions put so much fear into the hearts of Southerners ending the emancipation movement in the region.

And the time frame in between American slavery and when the Bible was written is enormously wide. Those are different... For slavery and wars. But the Ancient Hebrews wrote the Bible, which were black and our Bible has been constantly used against humanity. Many people do not know that the Holy Bible is not a Christian Bible... God or Jesus never told us to call ourselves Christians. Actually, the only time Christian is ever used in the Bible is when the apostles at Antioch were hating and called the disciples Christians in a form of mockery. So the term is actually an insult. Then God said to them to not be troubled being called that. But God only refers to his people as Isreal/Isrealites. And Christianity does not follow the word of God as it should (and kinda blends in with the world when God said stand apart, but be a light) because 1. It's purposely confusing that's why there's so many forms of Christianity and versions of the Bible (words had different meanings back then and they spoke differently, but some meanings were changed by white people), when God was like you're either a believer or you're not and we need to study the original Ancient Hebrew version, and 2. Christians celebrate holidays that God does not approve of such as the Pagan holiday Easter which is not in the Bible nor is it a holy day. But God says the devil is the prince of this world and that he and his descendants/fallen angels/13 bloodlines (like the Rothschilds) rule and control this world for now (Ephesians 6:12) and majorly influence it through total control of the monetary system (central bank/federal reserve), music and media, as Satan's gift and talent was music in heaven... I've been reading to fully understand and the Bible does make perfect sense. Life is just a journey for us to see and understand why we end up in heaven or hell based on our own free choice. The devil wants us to be reprobate and stubborn, not change and think hell doesn't exist and that nothing matters so do what you want but we don't belong to ourselves and we have a soul. The Bible is clear in how we should live for our Creator. We just need to focus on living by the word, teaching others and sharing true love, which is love for God, humanity, and an interest in each other's culture, history, and background... Jesus is God and his example on earth. If you read the Bible it'll tell you how you can identify him when he returns.

2018-01-11T19:27:34,"Do not go off of certain translations. Have you read the original Ancient Hebrew version or is that the NLT Version????? The original version does NOT say ""slaves""!! Did you know that? Also just as a note, certain words meant different things back then. You should read the original version of the Bible and surrounding verses. Before that scripture what does it talk about? Children respecting their parents. Ask God for clarity. Some versions were edited by ""certain"" people. Ancient Hebrews were people of color and the Bible is much older than American slavery... We were the 1st people on earth and created in God's image of bronze skin and wooly hair as the Bible states. ""Servant"" in the ORIGINAL version of the Bible does not carry the same meaning as the cruel term you're thinking of. It is a worker who does a service, a job. They talked differently back then of course. In fact, such terms didn't have a negative meaning until white people gave them one. So it goes from talking about respect in home to your parents, to in the workplace. Quoted ""St. Paul is saying The servant is a man in spiritual and immortal being, NOT a “living TOOL” or “chattel, Servants — Δουλοι, bond-servants; or he may include also those that were in the station of HIRED servants. For the gospel does NOT cancel the civil rights of mankind; according to the flesh"". Therefore the Bible is not condoning the kind of slavery you're thinking of. ""with fear and trembling, or as other versions say Respect, — A proverbial expression, implying the utmost care and diligence"" and to obey the laws of the land. You have to have an humble spirit unto God first and foremost. As you can see, Master also didn't mean Owner. And Servants were hired and therefore paid and respected in return. It was nothing cruel like American slavery which happened way way way LATER than the Bible. This is what I mean by how Whites confused and used the word against people and also purposely turned ""master"" into a negative term when back then, it was like saying manager or officer. You need to study the word through your spiritual eye in order to ACCURATELY interpret the Bible. Once again, Christianity has nothing to do with the Ancient Hebrew Bible (Holy Bible). Because one was written by black inspired by God (Bible) and one was made by white (Christianity). Of course they used it against people but that's only to deter us from our God we know and each other. What are many of their traditions? Celtic. Pagan. Gothic. Atheism. Etc. As the Bible would say is Satanism. So don't be mislead.",0,0,Face Reality,i18z1EQCoyg,0.0007782335907335843,2018-01-11 19:27:34,False,False

Let's take a close look at this scripture. Egypt is in Africa...and God used it as our punishment. Africans were never apart of God's covenant that caused our judgements. Amos 3:1-2 Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying, 2. You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. Exodus 6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. In ships. The timeline for this is about 1441 A.D. World enslavement has begun, long after our Exodus from Egypt. Exodus 20:2 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Anywhere we're taken to the four corners of the world, would be bondage like we had in Egypt. We have never been to our family's home in Jerusalem, like God said. And our oppressors are called our ENEMIES they did not act as a friend to us. Our family could not free us from bondage and yet we were sold to our ENEMIES.
