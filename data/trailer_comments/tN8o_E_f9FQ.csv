2018-03-28T14:35:31,"I love a lot of things about this, but they did change certain things from the book starting with black betty, but I don't mind the change/s if it/they served a purpose. I love how they kept in the detail of Chubs holding Liam's legs so he doesn't fall out or how Zu silently pointed and then the bullet hit the screen. However, this trailer doesn't show Ruby like the badass, sarcastic girl she was in the books and it shows a lot of red action. Don't get me wrong. This trailer and cast is everything I could hope for, but personally I'm still waiting for the scene where Ruby slaps Liam after the chase or something that shows the book more(like an adventure road trip with the white noise interfering and then how the characters get closer and how Ruby is insecure about her Orange powers and then growing stronger e.t.c). These are just my personal opinions so feel free to disagree, but I still have high hopes for this movie and nothing can be perfect. Also this may remind certain people of the x-men series, but I assure you that this is an original story with a different plot and storyline and the only thing remotely similar between the two is that it's about kid's that have power.    OKAY I JUST NOTICED THAT RIGHT AFTER THE START AROUND 0:08 CHUBS AND RUBY ARE TOGETHER AND ITS PROBABLY WHEN THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT 'EDO' MEANS AND THEN THE WAY HOW RUBY'S EYE'S TURN ORANGE AND LIAMS BLUE!!!

2018-03-29T13:14:56,"(Christ comforts his disciples. Jesus is coming back and bringing us back with him to Heaven, where he has prepared a place for us to live with him for Eternity):   (Jesus):   Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God,  believe also in me.   (Jesus told his disciples not be be troubled, but to trust him).   In my Father's house  are many mansions:   if it were not so,  I would have told you.   I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you,   (Mansions): Refers to dwelling places. Everybody has a longing for a permanent, secure place. Such places have already been set aside for all of God's children). (1 John 3:10)<---In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not/practice righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother).   I will (come again),  and (receive you) (unto myself);   that where I am,  there ye may be also.   (I will come again and receive you): Peter may have failed Jesus, but Christ will not fail to return for Peter and for everyone else who had believed in Him. (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17)<---For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord).   And whither I go ye know,  and the way ye know.   (John 14:1-4).   (BELIEVE):   ***The Greek word for believe literally means ""to place one's trust in another""; It occurs over 90 times in the Gospel of John alone.   ***To believe in Jesus is to believe in His person and to trust in Him completely for salvation. (John 3:15-16).   ***Many of Jesus contemporaries believed in Jesus miraculous powers, but they would not believe in Jesus Himself. (John 6:23-26).   ***Others wanted to believe in a political Messiah, but would not believe in the one who suffered for their sins. (Mark 15:32).   ***But we must be careful to believe and trust in the Jesus presented in the Scriptures, in the Son of God who sacrificed his life for our sins.   ***(Galatians 1:3-4)<---Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,Who gave himself for our sins, that he might (deliver us) (from) this present (evil world), according to the (will of God) (and) (our Father).   ***(Philippians 2:5-8)<---Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be (equal with God): But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.",0,0,mlzanercik,tN8o_E_f9FQ,-0.03806818181818183,2018-03-29 13:14:56,True,True

I am sure they can play the part pretty well, but I feel as if they may not capture their full personalities, and then there is the fact that they don't look so much like their book characters, especially Ruby. Also, Zu should have very short hair, Chubs should have shorter hair and his glasses don't seem to look like his silver wired frame glasses in the book, Liam doesn't have his southern accent and his hair isn't as blonde, then there is Ruby who us obviously very different.

Sure, superpowers aren’t the most original or exciting thing anymore and it appears to play out some classic YA tropes, but that’s not a bad thing.  Their target is young adults so making the protagonists their age only makes sense, so that’s why they’re all kids and teens.  If that bothers you then you’re not their target audience and that won’t affect them one way or another.  Furthermore, please understand that tropes are reoccurring ideas in entertainment because they became popular.  Only when they are overused and become a tool rather than an idea does it become a cliche, so having precedent tropes does not automatically make it bad.  Now as someone who only found out this is based on a book series, I’m still highly intrigued.  I enjoy super powered plots (especially when that doesn’t automatically translate into being a superhero) and will probably watch this.  I know it’s a lot to ask, but please stop saying something will be garbage just because it follows a YA format and has powers (and that doesn’t make it an X-Men rip-off either).",0,0,Phillip Marsh,tN8o_E_f9FQ,0.10447368421052636,2018-04-08 06:22:47,True,True

Stop bashing minorities getting representation when you didn't say anything when it was them being taken out. I think a character is a character. I personally imagined Ruby as darker skinned but if she was cast as white, knowing everyone has different imaginations, I wouldn't have been bothered a bit. I expected it even. Why are you so angry that a character's skin color isn't the same? It's ridiculous. We're all human and she's just an actress filling a role. Check yourself.

Zu is asian and chubbs is black so there was no point in making her black. If you want more black lead roles write your own books and make them good so they'll get turned into a movie. Plus Zu's hair is changed which doesn't bother me as much because they kept her ethnically correct and what's the point of black betty if the van is white and not black? They could have AT LEAST had Amandla's hair appear straight in the movie if they couldn't cast the race that she was in the book. Liam's accent should be there too because it's apart of his character. They should really stick to the books by physical and personality appearance of the characters.

The only time i might get a little pissy is if it was a historically accurate movie and make a poc white. Not every poc gets upset when they are being played by a white person. Other than that, it's nice to have an asian girl as one of the main leads. That doesn't happen often. Ruby and Chubs (forgive me I haven't read the book)  get a main lead to have a positive representation. Not as a ratchet ghetto hood person. I get what you people are saying about ""it's not what it was in the book"", however why should it matter. It isn't propaganda or sjw. It is what it is. If movie creators want to make this movie in particular and change the characters up a bit...that's fine. As long as they can act, i'm fine by it. Even tho u guys (not all but some) always complain ""why is it always about race?!"" Try and be stared at most of the time uncomfortably or be automatically stereotyped sometimes for other people to have a bad opinion about you. Try being arrested for no other reason yet you are going on about ur day, but you are Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American etcetera. Representation is important because race is all around us. Some people won't believe how often how much sh*t poc put up with to anybody who is racist. I said anybody because some white ppl aren't always the cause of racism.

I'm very happy that a movie adaptation is happening, but a lot is untrue.  -Liam should have a southern accent. and I'm sure we all pictured him more blonde, as he was described in the books  -zu is supposed to have close to no hair. I think they could've put the actress in a wig to create the illusion of it atleast  -no reds were part of the first book. they were only talked about.  -ruby. touchy subject. I think it's cool that more black representation is in Hollywood. it's a great step forward for how casting goes. but, her hair had been discribed as straight/tangled and her eyes green. I seriously doubt any author would describe curly-kinky hair as ""tangled"". and since she was taken as a child I will assume that wigs were not a part of life, nor were they mentioned. I say all this about her hair because I have yet to meet or know of a black person born with straight hair. it's just traits of their race, like how asian people will usually have dark eyes/hair. I hope I don't come off as ""anti-black"" or anything. my whole problem about this is that the director took it to herself to decide Ruby's race which is contradicting to what the books told us. sidenote: her name. Ruby Elizabeth Daly. Daly is of  Irish origins. thought I'd mention this.  -the van! justice should be delivered for Black Betty. she is a ""mom van""!  -that scene with an amphitheater/arena ish look. never mentioned in the first book at all. also don't know why all those kids had their color painted on themselves. where did they come from? don't know. it's untrue.  -I get the suspicion that the plot has been reformed in some places and can't say I'm liking that too much",0,0,baseball,tN8o_E_f9FQ,0.12951388888888893,2018-07-29 01:40:17,False,True

The plot is different nor do the mutations grant random powers but a wave of similar ones Red and Yellows are in a similar branch just like Blue and Oranges. Now everything think it's okay after seeing the movie to ridicule the books as well saying there's too many drawn out sections of dialogue throughout them. Way to hop on the down trot bandwagon folks.

In my opinion the plots are interesting and the acting is mediocre(not always)  ,but at one point they simply become predictable and dull since all of the books and movies are not identical BUT all have the same structure.(Some of the books are really good as well as some movies). I personally belive that filmmakers are very aware of all this,but instead of trying to approach a different concept beacuse it risks to be a commercial failure ,they will probably keep making these kind of movies for some time since the majority of the public enjoys them . I think this movie was alright ,but not amazing.  *Thanks again to anyone that took the time to read this and also if you a have a different opinion feel free to reply to my comment ,but please do it in an apropriate way I do not want to argue with anyone (:*",0,0,Sashka,tN8o_E_f9FQ,0.04871794871794872,2018-08-11 19:49:56,False,True

I'm thinking of possible trailer designs.  I'm thinking start with the escape moment, focus on her mind controlling the guard and Cate's ""Oh my God"", and then set the scene of how it all started (girl at start dying, no kids, fear of survivors, concentration camps, violence at the camps) then build up all the threats that you face in the world after escaping and play up how everyone wants something and the distrust element.  Don't show anything from them reaching ED0 onwards (maybe a shot of reds throwing fireballs for the list of threats) - just build up to it and you could possibly hint with the ""I can show you how to control your powers"" towards the end.",0,0,forgottenfamily,tN8o_E_f9FQ,-0.0644230769230769,2018-08-17 18:39:51,False,True

I really liked the casting ngl; chubs was perfect (dunno why they made him green though, that was just his personality), Liam was also perfect, as was Zu (who should have been bald.. seriously not that hard) and Ruby (who I’m pretty sure is biracial for anyone curious). I only just watched it today, try an hour ago, after binging the first book and part of the second. And I have to say, they went quite off track but I’d still like to see a second one. Hopefully they can fix the rushed pace and perhaps try to stick a little bit closer to details.

If they don’t make another movie n finish the series I’m gonna be so unbelievably upset. Don’t understand why ppl bashing this movie. Ppl need Appreciate a good movie when it’s being made for us to see. They have tons n tons of dumb movies that have been coming out for years based off books.

This movie was amazingly well put together. Hope n pray they come out with a second one. This movie reminded me of hunger games.

And even though it has a similar plot (such as the fact that they show the history of the chosen one or the one that has the cure for an entire unbreakable system), great details such as the cast, the soapbox, the plot and the message are things that differentiate it , and I think that this is not in the shadow of any.  I think that at all times the movie maintains a good level, it will keep you basnate engaged with the story and eager to know how the chaos will end.  The fact that the protagonist passes different things (such as celebrating a victory, feeling joy with adrenaline, or a large void due to his actions), makes me as a spectator get me much more into the movie, and that is affected in each scene.

Everything from her hair to height to mannerism. 10/10 *Liam:* Liam is pretty good. He’s attractive and quite charming, casted well. My only problem is that the slight southern accent is missing. Other than that, pretty good 8/10  *Chubs:* Chubs is a phenomenal actor who plays his role really well. My only problem is that in the books, Chubs is white. But besides that, everything is good. He’s skinny, gangly, annoying and weird. 7/10  *Zu:* Suzumine was casted really well. She does a good job I’m staying silent, but saying everything at the same time.  The only problem is the fact taht her hair is meant to be short, almost in a buzz cut. But this may be that the actress didn’t want to commit to that, which is fine. 9/10",50,10,『 bagel squid 』,tN8o_E_f9FQ,0.21696428571428575,2019-03-24 03:07:26,False,False

This movie reminded me of The Hunger Games. The only difference is that The Hunger Games actually had a closing ending to each movie. And once they secured the budget for all the sequels they were able to make an ending like this movie did. This movie went ahead of themselves and ended the movie with the start of a revolution which sadly we will never get to see. All movies should have a Beginning, Middle, and END! This movie only had a Beginning and Middle, NO END. Movies are only allowed to have these types of endings when they have a budget secured for all the sequels.
