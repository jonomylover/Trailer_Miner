2018-09-05T15:04:37,"Just to make things clear for some of the people that are confused.  Laurie Strode is still alive because this takes place after the 1978 movie. It's a direct sequel to the original. None of the other movies matter here. They're making it that the original film had a different ending and Michael was captured that night, 40 years ago and has been in prison ever since. He is no longer Laurie's brother. That storyline started in Halloween II (1981). Also the OG actor that played 'The Shape' Nick Castle appears in only one scene. It's the window scene when Laurie first sees him.",673,111,Denko,x_-x4Dwz-rU,0.0775,2018-09-05 15:04:37,True,True

They have paid great attention to detail with (from what I have seen as far as trailers and sneek peeks) numerous throwbacks to the ORIGINAL John Carpenter/Debra Hill Halloween. For all of us out here old enough to remember watching this for the first time on your parents couch, the safety of mom and Dad either sitting next to you or in the kitchen making popcorn, you all know what I mean with the above statement.  I cant remember what clip I had seen recently that even had on of those wide brimmed hats in the scene. It was a nod back to the when they Show Laurie in her room after her walk home with Annie And Linda. You will notice the SAME hat hanging on her wall that is in one of the scenes for the 2018 Halloween. This is gonna be one hell of a film folks!!

2018-09-05T16:19:04,This looks so intense. I have huge expectations for this film. The Shape is back and scarier than ever. The suspense and his (Michael's) randomness is exactly what Jamie Lee Curtis said in the interviews.  I was shocked when in the end Michael started to choke Laurie. That's creepy. I really hope sge survives.  I have no doubts that this will be huge in the box office. 🎃🎃🎃,0,0,Saku Raitonen,x_-x4Dwz-rU,0.03125000000000003,2018-09-05 16:19:04,True,True

2018-09-05T19:32:57,"Fucking AWESOME!! Excuse my profanity. I just got through my 2nd viewing of this new trailer. SO PUMPED for next month!!! Laurie Strode ain't fucking around this time. It be cool if, right before she kills Michael ( if she kills him, that is) Laurie says to him, ""Trick or Treat, Motherfucker!"" As a reference to the shit-show that was Resurrection. Then again, that doesn't seem like something Laurie would say, even to Michael Myers.  Also, something I still don't get is why would Myers still be after Laurie after 40 YEARS. I get that, in the original, Michael most likely targeted her because she was the first person he saw, and something about her captivated him. Ok. That's fine. But after forty years of incarceration at Smith's Grove, Michael escapes and thinks, "" Hm, who should I kill first? Oh, I know! How about that Strode girl I failed to kill 4 decades ago! Despite the fact that there are hundreds of other residents in Haddonfield that I could butcher and kill, I'll obsess over this one person!"" Because THAT totally makes sense. With H2 and all other sequels being non-canon, Michael's obsession over Laurie in this Halloween film is unnecessary! Why would he fixate on one person, in a town of possible HUNDREDS, for 40 years? How does he even still remember who she is, for God's sake. He's spent the last 40 YEARS behind bars. SURELY there were other things on his mind.

Perfect double feature for a Halloween movie night.Together with H20 (disregarding all other movies) you could even see them as a triology in between the franchise. However, I always felt it kinda stupid that they were siblings as setup in the sequel. I like that the movie disregard every other movie and gives us a new sequel.

2018-09-06T00:45:02,"2018 is just BLOWING my mind, as a loyal horror fan. I mean, what monumental achievements we have. This year will go down in horror history as the year of the triple threat -- with Halloween (2018), Hereditary and A Quiet Place earning their place among the classics. 2018 has seen some of the most groundbreaking horror films since the turn of the millenium. The bold, beautiful and heart-pounding What Keeps You Alive deserves an honorable mention. The horror genre hasn't gotten this much glory since the days of all the original classics, as well as '96 when the original Scream brought the genre back from the dead. We've had a few more fleeting landmarks with The Sixth Sense, The Ring, The Descent, The Conjuring, but this year is truly unparalleled.  Hereditary & A Quiet Place are even being considered for OSCARS this year. Thanks to Get Out's nomination last year for paving the way. I honestly think Toni Collette has a shot at winning best actress, with Emily Blunt a close second (her portrayal of attempting to deliver a baby in silence was absolutely incredible).  Just to re-cap all of this: the horror films to see this year are A Quiet Place, Hereditary, What Keeps You Alive, and Halloween (2018). Annihilation was also INCREDIBLE, but more sci-fi with elements of horror blended in. Steven Soderbergh's Unsane also deserves a mention: a fantastic psychological thriller with an unforgettable performance from Claire Foy.",0,0,Nicholas Kavanaugh,x_-x4Dwz-rU,0.2866203703703704,2018-09-06 00:45:02,True,True

I happen to think (just from the trailer) that a subtle one is being highlighted here. I love the Halloween movies, I truly do. I just hope that it is not what appears to be as far as the political ""push"". What push? The firearms used. Notice that Laurie (a civilian) uses a lever action & a revolver, but the police are using a semi-auto. It appears that ""they"" want to push the point that civilians should not have what the left calls ""weapons of war/battle"" and that only military & police should have semi-autos.

2018-09-07T04:43:21,"I still prefer the old original ""Halloween"" that I saw as a teenager. It scared the living daylights out of me. What made it great besides the great casting of Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance as the psych doc was that was the first suspense/horror movie made set on Halloween and involving a catatonic sociopath who escapes from an insane asylum to become the real life boogyman. Plus, adding that simple few music notes made it complete. I don't find blood and gore the least bit scary. Those movies have no imagination and anyone can go looping off heads with a chainsaw but to me it's having a good storyline, actors and it's the suspense of what might happen and the buildup to it that made the original Halloween movie at the edge of my seat screaming for Laurie to hurry up and run faster or the uncertainty of where he's gonna pop up next. That scene when she hides in the closet and Michael Myers is there in the room and I'm going No! No!.... I still hail [it] the original Halloween still today as the most scariest movies I've seen.

2018-09-07T09:03:41,"The suspense in the original which came out before Friday the 13th, and the notion that all slasher antagonists were juggernauts ever existed, was built  on the idea that he looked human, but acted less humane than humanity could imagine. He sauntered like a zombie, waited in the shadows, but for the 70's still was able to stay undetected in suburban areas. He was able to stand roughly half a block from his victims in daylight, and not get spotted. It's disturbingly nice to see that revisited.  I think the premise of him walking down the street initially highlights how society changes after forty years and how similar society stays. There's more horror in the news than there is in folklore, and the only person in Haddonfield that understands the presence of danger is Laurie. The kids are too young to have ever learned about Michael, so they probably thought he was just a parent or adult trick or treater.   After forty years without incident, residents of Haddonfield likely got comfortable in their sense of safety and disregarded the horrors of the past, and as they say: ""Those that forget history are doomed to repeat it.""  Michael likely felt this, as well as a sense of nostalgia walking through the town once again. Like a kid in a candy store, he was trying to pick out what was first. What made Michael scary in the original film was that he was patient, methodical, ridiculously strong, and stoic.  Having retconned the sequels, and establishing this as a stand-alone ""what if"" scenario gives the makers of this Halloween freedom to say ""this is what COULD happen if we remove the mythology from the series and strip it back to basics.""   No supernatural elements, no sibling issues, no undead carbon copy killer: They left the methodical monster from the original film alone in an asylum with 40 years to plan ahead and reflect on his mistakes.  And on the tail side of the coin, they left the sole survivor to plan ahead and remember for forty years what she survived. Laurie waited forty years, as life and history slowly desensitized itself to what happened so much that the teenagers can nonchalantly talk about what happened like a childhood camping trip or a story their grandparents told them about their hey day.   All the while, she did everything she could to try and ensure she'd be the hunter and not the prey this time. She armed herself, made contingencies for her family, disregarded her reputation in town and relegated herself to the town crazy lady to ensure her and hers were safe.   I'm liking the direction this is headed. Here's hoping for a great story.  Come October, we'll have the answer to that ""What If"" question.

2018-09-08T18:27:26,"Okay. So. Michael was five years old when he killed his sister in the beginning of the original Halloween movie. However, the focus of the movie is his baby sister, Laurie, when she's a senior in high school. Roughly, let's give or take a 15 year time span. If Laurie was 17 in 1978, that would mean Michael would have been 5 years old in 1963, making him at least 22 during the focus of the film. If what Laurie had said is true, ""forty years ago,"" that would imply Michael being at least 62 years old. I'm beginning to think less of how the Halloween series as a horror movie series and see it as a documentary on how bad our government is. Either Michael is Saddam and has been hiding in a cave for forty years and only peeks his head out like a groundhog once a year or there are some plot holes to this movie that have already come to light. Yes, there are a lot of very fit and healthy 60 year old men out there BUT that takes a lot of good dieting and exercise. Hypothetically, let's say Michael was in the penitentiary for the last forty years, convicts do not get fed the necessary means to obtain such a diet. Now, let's say Michael lived in the wild for the last 40 years, that would mean Michael would be even more skilled at hunting than Ted Nugent. Lets give Michael the benefit of the doubt and say he is this skilled hunter and has been surviving off the land all this time. Say he mastered hunting, which there isn't a whole lot of hunting to do in Illinois because it is mostly farmland, it would be next to impossible for him to never get caught, or more importantly, surviving the winters as long as he apparently has. My point is, it doesn't take a genius to realize the plot holes.",0,4,Viva La Grover,x_-x4Dwz-rU,0.10649122807017544,2018-09-08 18:27:26,True,True

The only way to get people to be scared of anything nowadays is to put them in those situations (I don't mean actually getting a knife and mass murdering people).  A good idea, in my opinion, is maybe like a Michael Myers attraction,  where a company builds a very small town (about the size of that Freddy Krueger map from dead by daylight) and play a game.  The way it works is a group of people is placed in random locations in the town and their objective is to find the key to the gate in order to escape.  The killers' job is to basically scare the people shitless and capture them.  Once you are captured, you lose.

I love the Halloween series of all time it's my favorite horror series been a fan of it since I was 5 now I am 19 !!! I am seeing it with my friend!! But I am noticing that every time I go on a movie that only was at a film festival the people who see it spoil the damn movie for everyone else because they are asswholes well I am not going to be spoiled lol because I will not look at the comments until after I see movie to give my non spoiler review because I don't think anyone wants to see the movie when they are spoiled the fun!    So I would suggest anyone who wants to see this movie don't look at the comments I am 1000 percent sure there are a few comments that spoil everything and I don't want that to happen to the Halloween fans who have loved this series since the 1978 film!    So until then I am not going to look at the comments till October 19 lol    So see you guys soon!!!!!!!

2018-09-12T04:45:28,"Jesus, could they have shamelessly referenced any more elements from the past films? This is basically Halloween H40: 40 Years Later, incorporating elements of Halloween II (Michael stalking the residents of Haddonfield, killing them and going about undetected on Halloween night), the fucking kid that runs into Michael in the original Halloween scene is LITERALLY ripped off, Laurie being cautious about Michael's inevitable escape/return, the bathroom scene, Michael gaining his ensemble in the same fashion as Halloween 4, it's incredible.  Still looks cool though, be nice to see what the FUCK the story's going to be and what everyone is creating such praise for when this story and franchise has been done to death to the point it's only source of revival is through omission of the sequels and starting anew with a different timeline or a reboot altogether.  Shame they didn't have the balls to try and pick up after that bullshit cliffhanger in Halloween: Resurrection, or Halloween 6, which, practically would've been impossible, but I would've had much more respect for them trying to continue instead of negating the elements of the story constantly and throwing out what was made to have an excuse to rewrite a story that had several dead ends.  Don't you love how they undermine the suspense of the original's ending by flat out making it clear that Michael didn't get far and was captured the same night?   Wouldn't the original ending to Carpenter's classic be so much more scary and meaningful if Michael's fate was left ambiguous, instead of being spoon-fed this contrived device to have him recaptured when, by all extents of his capabilities and actions in the first film, should NOT have been possible in the first place?",0,0,Jon LaFontaine,x_-x4Dwz-rU,0.08513513513513514,2018-09-12 04:45:28,True,True

The kids bumping into Michael..  The scene from H2 where Micheal gets the knife from the lady with the curls while she asks her husband if she wants the sandwich...  The bathroom stall scene from H20... The mechanic scene from H4 in the body shop...  The road full of the nutters after the bus crashes... The H20 style of Laurie calling for Micheal.. Plus others... Please tell me there will be more originality. Don't get me wrong. I love a good callback but not when the whole movie is riding on them.

Since this new movie is completely forgoing all the events that transpired after the 1st film, and Myers has been wallowing in the sanatarium for 40 years, unable to cause anyone, any harm; not the least of which Laurie Strode-why then, did Strode tell the sheriff she had been hoping and waiting for Michael to escape? Why would she say that? What would make her think he would ever be able to escape? Supposedly, according to the (new)lore/timeline, none of those other sequels ever took place. So, the continuity is all out of whack. Am I missing something? Can someone, anyone shed some light on to this and resolve this discrepancy, because it makes virtually no sense. Laurie Strode would have no reason to believe Michael was planning on coming after her. WTF, is she a friggin' psychic? Remember, he only went after her one time.  Not twice or 3 times.

2018-09-15T22:16:52,"I've saw this movie's ending in Toronto. I liked it. It made me do some thinking. They can either go with the Halloween 3 or Halloween (whatever year) idea or Hellraiser vs Michael Myers idea because 1 this movie can confirm Myers being fully immortal. 2 It can explain his childhood and why he acts the way he acts,etc and lastly 3 it's far more important than Michael vs Jason. Why I said those 3? for those who don't know.. here's why! this movie can confirm Myers being fully immortal because Judith Myers (Michael's sister) she could've found the puzzle box sitting around somewhere, picked it up, and gave it to Michael to play with or whatever then Michael plays with it, finds out a way to open it and Hellraiser and the cenobites appear sending Michael to hell and they curse him to kill forever or once he opens it, they tear his soul apart. then they do what they did to Hellraiser and make Michael immortal in hell, then Michael becomes immortal and blames his family for his death or Judith. Which explains why he killed her (which is justifiable.) or is just back for revenge and wants to take his anger out on anyone he see's. They can go with any of those directions. It's more important than Michael vs Jason because this movie confirms Michael being immortal rather than being mortal. Then Michael could actually stand a chance against Zombie Voorhees from ft13th 6-9, Jason X, and Freddy vs Jason. Matter and fact Michael might actually win against Jason if he's immortal. I mean they're both immortal but if Michael's immortal and facing Jason, not to mention Michael HAS intelligence! (Jason does as well but doesn't use it often and isn't as intelligent as Michael). Michael would win.  ALSO Hellraiser vs Michael Myers the winner should be Michael Myers setting up Michael  vs Jason afterwards.  I don't think it's too late for a Hellraiser vs Michael Myers movie Doug could prob get back in shape for the movie.",0,0,Seth Genius,x_-x4Dwz-rU,0.20052083333333334,2018-09-15 22:16:52,True,True

2018-09-17T19:12:35,"When Laurie talks bout Michael being a Myth, a ghost story to tells kid. It kinda makes me look back on the franchise looking at them as a myth story telling in between 1978-2018 like 2,4,5,6,7,8,RZ,H2 were stories and rummors that spread around the town by the people of haddonfield. So this movie pays alot homage threw out this franchise seeing these nods kinda makes sense and its an alternate reality on how this movie connects without the family bloodlines. It is a awesome way to do it. So like here's what Laurie's grand daughter says ( No! It was not her brother that something somebody made up). That line kinda made me think how this movie it will fit without continuing the story but giving this franchise a true chaprter and ending for Michael Myers. It's been a long time sense we seen a good Halloween and im excited can't wait to watch it this, halloween by far my favorite horror franchise in my opinion so excited.",35,4,Mason Myers 31st,x_-x4Dwz-rU,0.3645833333333333,2018-09-17 19:12:35,True,True

2018-09-17T23:16:47,"The 1978 original is one of the best horror movies ever made. It's easy to create violence on the screen, but it's hard to do it well. In this case Carpenter does an amazing job of it. One of the things that is great is how he portrays the victims. They're all ordinary, everyday people -- nobody's supposed to be the star and have a big scene and win a Golden Globe or an Academy Award. The performances are all the better because of that; the movie's a slice of typical Americana that is carefully constructed before the monster enters the scene. It doesn't need over the top scenes of blood and gore to frighten us. Instead it uses the most terrifying weapon available to us......….our own thoughts. Not to mention the intro music is absolutely brilliant. It sends a chill down your spine and sets the tone for the movie right off the bat.

They tried it with H20/Resurrection and they were the worst movies in the franchise! We're just suppose to pretend that Michael Myers sat around doing nothin and it took him FOUR DECADES TO ESCAPE!!!!??? The best way to pay homage to the other movies was to NOT COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM! The trilogy with Jamie (Danielle Harris) was the best part of the entire series! All they had to do was continue from there. It would've been perfect to continue from the end of Halloween IV! Easily explain Dr. Loomis' absence by him dying of a heart attack after witnessing Jamie attempt to murder her foster parent, thus fearing the whole saga happening all over again! Finally having ""Jamie"" and ""Laurie"" together on screen giving fans exactly what they want for the very last movie! Use them both to tie up all the loose ends, while using their mother/daughter dynamic to tell a story within a story. Then, teaming up to kill Michael  and finishing the series once and for all leaving no room for anymore questions! But actually having Laurie die in battle with Michael at the end, having Jamie be the lone survivor, to give the finale a good twist...And what about Dr. Loomis'(Donald Pleasance's) legacy? Everything he sacrificed to kill Michael, just gets erased from history, and becomes ""rumors and made up stories"" throughout the years? Its ridiculous!

Do you want the ending, where Laurie (for good reasons) spends the entire movie being so hysterically loud, and screaming like she’s trying to make her audience regret they have the ability to hear, meanwhile she tries to escape Michael at such a slow pase where it looks like she could care less whether or not he ends up killing her? Then pick: *Halloween II* (1981)! or... Do you want the ending, where Laurie (after years of training) is ready to fight for the sake of her family, and for the sake of herself to finally end the years of trauma that, that beanheaded-Michael has caused her, inside a movie where the screenplay and direction actually looks really damn fckin good! A movie where the death scenes look as terrifying and haunting as they did in the original movie. And a movie that seems to highlight why Michael is such an iconic antagonist? Then pick: *Halloween* (2018)!  Nonetheless I’m excited asf! And I kinda forgot, why I wanted to write this, but now that I’ve done it, I sure as hell am going to publish it..

2018-10-11T11:51:54,"Jamie Lee Curtis is a strong, sometimes hysterical, gun control advocate, as evidenced by her tweets on this subject. Is she just another Hollywood hypocrite?   And for those who are saying this Jamie Lee Curtis role has nothing to do with the real world, let me point to several recent interviews with Jamie Lee Curtis talking about the new film. On ""the View"" she said: “I know it’s a slasher movie…but it actually is about something.” She continued, “It is fiction. I’m not saying it happened to me. It happened to Laurie Strode in the movies and here we are having a conversation, a global conversation about trauma…Christine Ford said this affected her…” Curtis went on to connect it to other incidents of trauma including a home invasion robbery and the women “drugged and raped” by Bill Cosby. “The heroine of Halloween is a woman who suffered a trauma when she was 17, like Dr. Ford when she was 17 and it changed and shaped her life. And now she is taking back the power.” In other words, it’s fiction but it connects to something real. That’s her pitch.  So here’s my question and it’s a sincere one: If the trauma is meant to connect to current, real trauma people are talking about, why doesn’t the specific response (gun ownership) also connect to specific issues we’re talking about at this moment. Curtis can certainly say the trauma is a real thing but the guns are just fantasy device, but why? I mean, real women in the world carry and own guns for exactly this reason. They don’t want to be traumatized by some crazed stalker, which is kind of the whole plot of Halloween and I guess this new movie as well. Does Curtis believe that owning a gun in real life is a legitimate way for women to take back the power? I think it’s a fair question.  Some say that maybe Curtis felt trapped into this because it’s her most famous role and guns were just part of the package. But that’s not true. Curtis never had a gun in the original film, only Dr. Loomis (played by Donald Pleasence) had one. And by the way, he saved her life with it at the end of the first movie. She literally would be dead if not for that revolver!!!  I agree that’s actually a positive, empowering message. I’m all for women owning guns (assuming they learn how to use them safely) because men are bigger and some of them are creeps. So, great, I like this story the film is telling. But I still think it’s not one that sits as easily with Curtis’ gun control campaigning...

I feel like they just wanted to make one last dollar off Halloween. I paid for Dolby theatre. SMH I want my money back.,0,0,CRDESIGNZ,x_-x4Dwz-rU,-0.11464285714285713,2018-10-19 04:10:17,False,True

2018-10-21T22:38:50,"I grew up on Halloween, coming out on my 8th birthday. It literally scared the shit out of me for years decades and that of my entire generation. Back then you could be left at home alone at night without your parents or a baby sitter and it was totally legal, creepy doors, shutters, storms, backyards, garages, real Halloween nights with getting apples being laced with razor blades, howling winds, real serial killers every night on the news, real killings, real kids living this, so Halloween is a truly special film series that speaks to an entire Generation of audiences, shaping them. Terrifying them, giving them nightmares and memories forever and wherever. There was nothing but horror film after horror film from the late 70's thru the 80's because of this movie. It had a huge effect on millions of kids and I think it shaped an entire generation unlike the Millennials of today who had none of that and are so f'd up today.  This was a great movie, great filmmaking, great acting, great horror scenes. Go see it. I know millions of Gen X'rs will for sure!!!  Can't wait to see it again. Definitely had a hard time sleeping afterwards, the images and violence is so incredibly real and I've worked with and cut up dead bodies in autopsies and surgeries and seen and worked with tons of blood, brains, and guts and real fucking real scary real viciously violent evil psychos in real life. Every scene is very authentic, creepy AF and simply awesome all around.  Can't wait for the sequel. Just gets better and better. Turned my interest in all the old horror films that I avoided because this one in 1978 scared me shitless, turned it on wide open.  All the classic Horror films are great and this series is the best!  This movie is more about the generational  trauma that haunts victims. People who don't understand that and are quite immature are the ones who didn't like it. It's great. It's real and it's scary and it's fulfilling for anyone who has lived a full life, especially well-developed women. The losers who didn't like it wouldn't know a good movie if they saw one and are big infantile boys still wearing diapers and thumb-sucking.  You want to know what's scary? Talk to trauma victims. Talk to gunners from OEF/OIF who are haunted by the ghosts of the Iraqi's they killed. Talk to Vietnam Vets who were mole rats and who can kill you with their bare hands. Talk to psychos who you can see nothing but pure menacing coldness and evil in their eyes. The way they move and stab you. This movie is all that and is fucking real, fucking poignant and simply the best, full circle. Wait til you live some of these scenes in real life and you will know what disturbing and scary is. This movie won't get your adrenaline flowing externally but will disturb you internally. It's like a rounded out, smoothed out, shaved down Halloween targeting much bigger audiences. It's the haunting imagery afterwards that gets you WHEN you LEAVE the theater.  Great movie! Go see it. The theater was fully packed and that has happened in three decades.",1,0,cmetube,x_-x4Dwz-rU,0.08505427360338073,2018-10-21 22:38:50,False,True

2018-10-22T04:12:16,"It wasn’t bad. I feel it could have been a bit better, but it was better than any of the other sequels by far. This movie is filled with suspense, scares, and even comedy. The theater room was literally filled with laughter during a brutal murder of a young blonde teenage girl. How could just a tragic and horrific thing be funny? Well, I won’t tell you why it’s funny, but just know you will laugh while this girl is being sliced and diced by Michael Myers. But the comedy was refreshing. It actually fit in well. And I don’t think I saw any nudity other than a clip from the original movie that was played, which was the scene where Michael killed his sister when he was a young lad. They don’t waste screen time on boob shots or sex scenes. It is particularly interesting when you get to spend quite a bit of time watching from Michael’s perspective. You see how he gets in peoples homes without them noticing him, etc. And I sincerely felt sad for Michael Myers at the end of the movie. To keep me from tearing up for Michael, I had to remind myself several times that he murdered a bunch of people and he only got what he deserved.",65,13,Fatal Disco,x_-x4Dwz-rU,0.025000000000000015,2018-10-22 04:12:16,False,True

If you watch it a second time, then notice that every white male in this movie is 1. evil. 2. feminine. 3. Goofy. 4. Stupid. 5. Illogical.  Perhaps you were so psyched for a great, scary movie that you didn't notice. If you see this film a second time, then you'll see that it was obviously made by self loathing, white liberal men who earn their brownie points by bashing white American males. Again, every single white male in this movie was a bad guy. That was NOT just a coincidence, it was indeed deliberate. The worst part of all is that it wasn't even remotely scary, the dramatic scenes were laughable and the humor was cringe-worthy bad.
