What would happen if we censored our music or movie libraries based upon sexual morality? We'd only watch Kirk Cameron movies. I get it. Removing Spacey makes us feel like we're doing something to make the world a better place. But is it the right thing? Is there lasting change? Will it teach Spacey a lesson? Will it result in less sexual assault? OR does it just further a myth. Reckoning with fallen heroes is difficult.

But the best lighting and atmospherics is when Getty is onscreen, the shades dark, temporally lonely, and enveloped in an impermeable wrap of green-bags and isolation. Actor Christopher Plummer lends an air of imperiousness that‚Äôs impenetrable and sometimes unfathomable ‚Äì and you know he‚Äôs hiding an uneasy past all through for his character. That somehow, tragically, also justifies his own manic obsessiveness with money, estate, paintings, and deals.""

2018-02-18T16:26:14,"""All the Money in the World"" is actually a pretty good movie. Christopher Plummer did a fine job, I've always been a big fan o this man. The moment when you can see Spacey as Plummer's double getting out of the train on the desert gave me goose bumps. I didn't know he was in this one shot and you can't clearly see him, but you'll know it's HIM somehow. Well, I knew it and my friends in the cinema too. Talking about his screen presence here? ;-) But... the movie was supposed to bomb with Spacey and the brutal truth so far is that it bombed without Spacey. I think if Plummer won't win an Oscar it would mean Scott is done in Hollywood for his Orwellian move.",0,0,helenagi,KXHrCBkIxQQ,0.12992424242424241,2018-02-18 16:26:14,False,True

Also I was very impressed by the acting of Gail Harris as the mother trying to rescue her son. Mark Wahlberg character who becomes disgusted at his boss J Paul Getty and Christopher Plummer as the cold hearted Evil selfish scrooge like American  billionaire corporation head J Paul Getty. The ending of the movie was memorable when the good hearted and kind Gail Harris as a Getty inherits the vast fortune as she looks at the bust of J Paul Getty the revulsion on her face at the bust as she realises what a cold, evil and selfish man J Paul Getty was. In other words a classic wealthy Elitist. Don't we see many of that type in todays world as banker and company heads. Watch this movie a big stand out is the American actress Gail Harris. Great acting performance and all concerned in this movie with excellent direction from Ridley Scott.",0,0,rohanmark jay,KXHrCBkIxQQ,0.07932098765432097,2018-06-01 00:08:25,False,False

She refuses to give up! Outstanding Acting and so ironic that this movie is about a cheaper than cheap tyrant who refused to pay ANY taxes and put all his money in a giant tax shelter that was supposed to help people and never did--and this man refused to pay a ransom to pay his grandson--and Michelle Williams didn't get even half of what Mark Wahlberg did for those re-takes. It was SO unfair that they did that to her. I DO adore Mark Wahlberg 100% and I don't think any of that was from him at all. She just really deserved as much as he made. I love the scene where they are driving to meet the grandfather to ask for the money and Mark Wahlberg finally admits he didn't do enough. He says ""he may be stupid but he's not lazy! Do not call him Lazy!""  oh, that's a fabulously intense scene. Classic! And of course Wahlberg is neither stupid or lazy :) This movie is Classy, fast and smart!!! Can be watched many times.

The last movie I watched with Spacey in it was #BabyDriver and I was very disappointed. To see him still hung over with his Frank Underwood demeanour. The previous trailor with Spacey in it also looked like an #HoC spin off. This movie was more than that. Spacey couldn't have and wouldn't have done justice to the role even before all the scandals .  That said, Spacey was a great actor, someone I really loved. I cannot imagine American Beauty or LA Confidential without him. As a matter of fact, I miss his good acting, and good movies. But that doesn't change the fact that what he did is highly condemnable. And I do.  One more thing , I got here from Spacey's still inactive social media profile. Although I was a bit sad seeing it, I also feel that perhaps that's because he doesn't want to deal with consequences of his actions.

In the 60s, the two brothers received $7 million each from that trust. The old man continued to live on until 1976.",0,1,RADIUM CLOCK,KXHrCBkIxQQ,-0.01893939393939396,2019-05-13 23:30:20,False,False
