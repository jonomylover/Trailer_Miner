2015-09-14T00:06:44,"I've seen a bunch of comments since this trailer was released saying, ""Oh wow, she's lived for longer than a century and all she does is feel sorry for herself about not being able to be with a man. Why is she complaining? Why doesn't she invest her time in becoming a doctor or an academic and then she can find the cure for cancer, rather than spend her whole life just worrying about her love life!?blaahhh blaaahhh bleeehhhh""  And yet nobody ever comments on Wolverine going through the exact same stuff.   Wolverine has lived longer than Adeline, and there is no indication of him ever even going to school much less becoming a doctor. If you guys had watched this movie, you'd know that Adeline went to medical school, before she was forced to leave because the FBI was chasing her down. Adeline can speak over 4 languages. Can Wolverine do that? Nope. Adeline traveled the world and gained an extensive historical knowledge, all the while having to abandon her daughter to keep her safe. Is there any indication that Wolverine ever did any of that stuff? No.   ""Oh, but all she does is mope about never aging. Wahhhh boo hoo for her! If I had her body I would NEVER complain about not aging!!"" Um, have you seen the Wolverine movie? The whole film, he just mopes and pines over Jean being dead. And in the Origins movie, he had a crisis about staying young forever, and the only reason he felt that way was because he was in love with a woman and he wanted to be with her but he couldn't because of his mutation. And nobody gave him shit for it, everybody understood and sympathized.  So why have all these bullshit comments appeared here and never in an X-Men trailer? Well, you could argue with me, but my best guess is because Adeline is a woman. And thus it is inherently assumed that any minuscule action she makes is naturally idiotic and pathetic and a direct result of her having ovaries.",1712,49,mcitrw,7UzSekc0LoQ,0.07991691468253968,2015-09-14 00:06:44,False,False

Two things drive me totally crazy, though.  The first is Adaline's initial one-night stand with Ellis.  I love their relationship, but hopping in the sack with a man she has no intention of seeing again (which was the case at that point), is totally out of character for Adaline.   The one other thing that drives me crazy is really silly and trivial, but it's the scene where Adeline gets in the taxi and it starts to go, then Ellis yells, ""Stop!"" and grabs the open window...and he's able to stop it with his hand!  That would severely injure his hand and not stop the taxi at all!
