As we watch people transform and move from hatred/fear/division to genuine healing/peace/unity, it helps us to see that the answer is found only in the gospel.  It reminds us that GOD has not changed, HE IS WHO HE SAYS HE IS.  The gospel reminds us that every human being matters to GOD and HE has made a way for us to know HIM, and to truly love one another.
