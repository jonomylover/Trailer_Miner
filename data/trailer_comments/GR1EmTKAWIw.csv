I know it's not a big deal to anyone at all, but i'm just really impressed and proud of Joseph, because every movie I see him in, Is somewhat immature.

2015-10-19T14:27:32,"As a solipsist I want you all to know that I created this movie with my mind. For a long time I have been studying the 'hell' out of 9/11 from both the truth movement perspective to the official story and it makes absolutely no sense. It defies logic. Thus like Renes Descartes I am convinced that the collective or more aptly the singular reality is just a figment of a godlike imagination. So what I would like to share with you is a little clue to how these directors like Robert Zemeckis are more wizards than men. By thy fruits ye shall know them. Ever heard that expression? Robert created two movies that tie into one another. ""Back to the Future"" and ""Contact"". Without getting into too many revealing details he was using these movies as vehicles to share a symbolic message with either a receptive collective conscience or a select group of individuals who would be able to decipher this cryptic message. This suggests in and of itself that there are those amongst us who follow a cryptic code. One might assume they are extra-terrestial beings but that would not be the case because they have their feet on the ground just like everyone else. In fact the extra-terrestial idea is really nothing more than a symbol for what we as humans already are aware of, that there is a spirit world. I am going on the hunch that one third of the host of heaven as mentioned in the bible exists here amongst us. They don't communicate with each other consciously thus you will not catch them in some conspiratorial verbal agreement. And they are not visually identifiable, so they would cross over all racial profiles. I have personally met some of these fallen angels. And a clue to how you recognize them is how when they drift out of your day to day environment, they seem to pop up 'randomly' in places that defy coincidence. So in all likelihood this person may be a family member, a former boyfriend or girlfriend, a colleague at work. I once even tried to test one of them by avoiding them after I spotted them from a distance because my eyesight and facial recognition ability is really quite keen. After hiding in different places to avoid them I found them trailing behind me purposely seeking me out and pretending when they did catch up to me that it was a surprise encounter. They would say ""Hey, fancy meeting you here"".",0,13,Lode Star,GR1EmTKAWIw,0.09750000000000003,2015-10-19 14:27:32,False,True

I loved this movie as it brought the towers back to life with special wonderful affects & we got to see them again in all their true glory in 3D too if you were lucky enough to see it thanks to Philippe's amazing stunt but also  sad to realise they are now gone because of a cruel act that the world will never forget.",0,0,Pike Meredith,GR1EmTKAWIw,0.15936507936507943,2019-09-01 10:57:22,False,False

2020-04-11T19:32:07,I watched this on AXN channel with my parents who were both in their 80s.  I got so very worried because both my Dad and Mom couldn't get a hold of their nerves during that wire-walk.  They stood up and started inch-walking away from the TV saying Oh my God-―Oh my God—Oh my God. Oh my God― Oh my God.  They just kept repeating OMG !  that I got so worried for my Mom that I rushed up and turned the TV off but right away they told me to turn it back on.  So there we were all three of us standing there and watching the guy wire-walking between the Twin Towers.  By then my parents were almost huddled together at the corner of the living room saying OMG OMG OMG OMG !   I was so so worried for my parents then. They were in good spirits after.
