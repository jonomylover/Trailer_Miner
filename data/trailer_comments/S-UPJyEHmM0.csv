2016-09-30T13:03:49,"In an irony fit for the big screen, executives were onboard Deepwater on 20 April when the explosions wracked the vessel, celebrating seven straight years without serious accidents. However, US federal data revealed that ""three of every four incidents that triggered federal investigations into safety and other problems on deepwater drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico since 2008 have been on rigs operated by Transocean.""   Mike Williams, an electronics technician (and Wahlberg's character in the cinematic take on the events) later testified he had raised concerns about safety.  The resulting oil spill saw around 780,000 cubic meters of oil gush into the waters, impacting 180,000 square kilometers of ocean. The sludge spread, affecting beaches, wetlands, and wildlife.  Oil gushed out of the well for a staggering 87 days, as repeated attempts to plug the hole failed. Other efforts to control the spill included controlled burns, setting the seas on fire, while skipper ships attempted to scoop the oil out of the water. The leak was plugged on July 15 and eventually, on September 19 the well was declared ""officially dead"" by US Coast Guard admiral Thad Allen, after cement was pumped in through a relief well.  The final report into the Deepwater disaster found BP was most to blame, though also held Transocean and contractor Halliburton to account - the latter for laying faulty cement in the well to begin with.  However, it ultimately determined BP made ""a series of decisions that complicated cementing operations, added risk, and may have contributed to the ultimate failure of the cement job"", which in turn allowed such a catastrophic volume of oil to flood the ocean. Darkly, BP's shares actually rose after the report, reportedly based on the fact it wasn't solely responsible for the disaster.  The impact of the spill is still being felt, though. The Deepwater Horizon incident ended up being the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry, and recent studies have found the pollution has lead to deformities in fish stocks in the area. The ecosystem is expected to take years to recover.",10,0,Mike Messiah,S-UPJyEHmM0,-0.019565217391304346,2016-09-30 13:03:49,False,True
