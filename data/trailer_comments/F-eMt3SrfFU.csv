Get him to bring great performances out of mediocre actors like a Kristen Stewart and then we can start considering him a great director.  Does he direct movies that are great stories? sure Does he direct films with amazing actors in them? sure Does he direct films that have great composers attached to them? sure But that doesn't make him the best director,  it just means he works with a lot of talented people. He can write some good poetic treatments(his stories tend to flow like a poem), but he can also write shitty screenplays, TDKR and The Prestige are proof enough of this.  We know he sucks at directing action, again, look at the Batman films.

2016-12-14T16:12:03,Aw poor Harry Styles haters who strongly believe he will ruin this movie when you have absolutely no idea how good he can act. I've  seen 95% of Christopher Nolan movies and I know he wouldn't waste his time on someone he didn't think had potential and could make his movie better. I'm sure he appreciates him luring his fan base in for this movie but he would never risk one of his big projects just for some extra fans (he has already many of them himself ). FIY not all directors are walking Harry fanatics who scream every time they see his face or hear his voice and even so there's nothing wrong with that once in a while. I'm a proud Directioner who's not here to defend just Harry but Christopher's movie as well because even if Harry wasn't in it I was still gonna watch it because some people can actually be Nolan AND Styles fan at the same time! Fascinating isn't it? You could be a fan of two people or two things at the same time hm but I guess haters will never understand that and just assume we're here because of a talented artist who's debuting his acting career and trying something new because he has the right to.,289,45,Ella,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.14797323888232977,2016-12-14 16:12:03,True,True

Someone give me a genuinely good reason as to why they would use a word so strong as ""hate"" when they describe the emotion they feel when they hear the name ""Harry Styles"".  Because he's famous? Well I'll have you know Harry hates the word ""famous"" for that very reason, he feels the word gives no substance to a person. People don't say ""Harry Styles is a genuinely nice easy going dude"" which he is, they just see he's ""famous"" then instantly judge him for that.   Because he's in a ""boy band""? What? You hate him because he's a talented guy who can sing an write songs? Well that's not a very good reason and you're obviously just a very judgemental person. You do realise One Direction have released more songs than just that stupid one 'What Makes You Beautiful', that was six years ago and they have seriously grown and developed as amazing musicians since. Writing songs like 'If I Could Fly', 'Walking in the Wind', 'Fireproof', 'What a Feeling' and 'Don't Forget Where You Belong' just to name a few. Their lousy management still market them as this cheesy prepubescent boy band when they're actually so much more than that, but your judgmental self probably won't look past that to even just contemplate respecting them as serious artists.   Because his fans are annoying? Maybe so, but shouldn't you say you ""hate Harry Styles' fans"" rather than say you hate him? If you have a problem with his fans fine, take it out on us call us all the names under the sun but don't say you hate Harry just because of his fans. Also I don't know what your problem with his fans are anyway, I won't apologise for supporting one of the nicest dudes on the planet.   I dare anyone who says they ""hate"" Harry Styles to watch a few videos showing the true Harry. The ones that show he's just a normal 22 year old guy, who shakes everyone's hand when he walks into a room, who climbs like an 9 foot fence just so he could shake the hands of the crew members and thank them for their work, who goes to dominos and spends ¬£3000 on pizza's and spends the day handing them out to homeless people, who makes a video message for a 4 year old girl who is terminally ill, who even tho you say you ""hate"" him would probably treat you with as much respect and kindness he deserves to be shown to him, but you choose not to because he's ""Harry Styles""",0,0,Harry Hepburn,F-eMt3SrfFU,-0.03187645687645688,2016-12-14 16:58:53,True,True

A lot of stories have been told about U.S. heroics and deeds during WWII (and hundreds more are still to come), but it's great to see what our allies went through during this tumultuous time too.

No, I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan and I'm interested in history, Harry is just a bonus. Am I going to praise Harry? Yes, because I'm proud. Don't judge people's intelligence or their maturity level based on what they like. If you do that, it just shows your own intelligence and maturity. And don't bash Harry, because if he wasn't good at acting, Nolan would not have made him a character in his movie and so many actors who worked with Harry said that he's good. So, give him a chance. Yeah, we are excited, but we are not going to ruin the movie. You know what we are going to do? We are going to promote the hell out of this movie.

2016-12-14T17:40:08,"Warner Bros. Pictures Got a idea for a theatrical 2D animated film that you and Cartoon Network should do together for both of your fans out there.  Since you guys made The PowerPuff Girls Movie back in the early 2000's, you guys should make a Codename Kids Next Door prequel film, akin to The PowerPuff Girls Movie, but spectacularly more amazing and fun to behold to date and become a total box office hit of a lifetime!  Nigel Uno got accidently chosen to be a part of the Kids Next Door to be Numbuh 1 because as it turns out that he got accidently chosen for a very good reason because he's the uber-special kid out of all of the other kids around the world to stop an god-like ancient adult evil from millions and millions of years ago and his godly adult titan army from taking over the entire world in one fell swoop and also make all the kids his slaves FOREVER!!!  The 2D animation needs to be spectacularly incredible, the cast and characters needs to be the loveably exact same people that the fans knows and love so much in the show along with the new ones, the music needs to be unbelievably awesome to listen to like it was composed by the same music people who worked at Marvel Studios and so much more. It'll also not only be an unbelievably unforgettable animated masterpiece in the history of animated films itself and also be the, if not, THE #1 10 out of 10 entertainingly greatest and epic fun prequel to date in the history of prequels yet at the same time, but it'll also be absolutely on par, if not, spectacularly more epic fun than ever before than Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy itself in every way possible, period!  Respond if you like this idea.  P.S, You should also make a 2D animated remake of 1997's Batman And Robin, but a million times better (and also sexier) than the live-action original itself on SO many levels than any Batman fan could possibly ever imagine and they'll even say that this is the film they want to watch it every single day instead of the original itself for all of the right reasons. And maybe do the 1995's Batman Forever as well while you're at it.",0,0,Mary Ellen Pallozzi,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.22584879406307976,2016-12-14 17:40:08,True,True

2016-12-14T18:00:49,"Nolan's minimalist effects style is usually pretty damn good, because he usually makes films about fantasies, but here it looks way too sterile, almost cheep, like the reenactments they play on history channel documentaries. The explosions that are clearly just dust blasts or too pyrotechnic, the absence of blood,  (headwounds bleed an absolute fuckton in reality) solely the implication of injury or death. I hope this is just because post production is still heavy underway, but as it stands now, this literally looks a euphemism of war.  The Dunkirk sequence in Atonement is great, though quite stylized- gritty, dirty, confusing, and most of all, features all of the real bizarness of military campaigns in the early months of the war.",0,0,Nick,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.09250000000000001,2016-12-14 18:00:49,True,True

2016-12-14T19:07:37,"The British Expeditionary Forces referred to the fighting French (who bought time for the evacuation), like something out of legends of old. When they saw the French standing their ground, they compared them to the Spartans at the Battle of Thermoplyae because of their fierce resistance and honor. You see a lot of WWI equipment in this trailer because the British and French hadn't modernized their armies in the way the Nazis did. Because of that, they relied on surplus weapons and equipment left over from WWI. The British practiced Chamberlain-style isolation, while the French laid the majority of their forces on the Maginot Line in a false sense of security. This led to the Nazi's blitzing across the Ardennes forest (which the allies, particularly the French, thought impossible to cross with tanks, motorcycles, and other military vehicles along with several armies), which rendered most of France exposed on the left flank. The damage was done. And when the armies of the Third Reich encircled the armies of France and Britain, Dunkirk was the result.   The reason it's one of the most important battles in history is that it threw away the tactics used in every war up until that point. On the eve of WWI, many of the troops from participating countries were filled with glee, and thought the war would be over in less than a year. On the eve of WWII, the tone was far more serious and somber.. While many countries saw the advancement in weapon systems by the Nazis, they never expected for the war to move as fast as it did.. Poland was virtually conquered in two weeks, for example. That was unheard of, at the time.

While the French were slowing down the German advance, the British were evacuated by an armada of civilian sea crafts and naval ships while under heavy fire from German airplanes. 400,000 men were saved that day which ultimately led to Britain¬†being able to keep fighting the Nazis and winning the war",0,0,CitizenSlyder,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.12074074074074073,2016-12-14 19:39:48,True,True

You can't expect us to just ignore the fact that our Harold got his first acting role.   And also if we can't watch Dunkirk because we came to support Harry,  does that mean that we can't watch x Factor either because it would be wrong that we only saw it because of 1d???    I don't fooking care if I see Harry three seconds on the screen or for one hour. I came to support him. The only reason why I'm coming is because of him. Is that so wrong???? I love Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan but the truth is just that I came to support the guy that I have standed and believed in for six years. I came because of Harry Styles. I don't really see a problem?   It is the exact same thing when you say that you are only seeing it because Christopher Nolan made the movie, double standards?   We are seeing it because we believe and are proud of Harry.   So stop being so childish and just accept the fact that people are coming for their own fooking reason.

His connection to a boy group you have no idea about doesn't have any  influence on his skills as an actor. 2. Making fun of young girls is not an adult behavior at all. 3.

Christopher Nolan makes the best of best movies and he knows what he's doing, I'm sure Harry was chosen because Mr. Nolan knew Harry could do it.  Don't be jealous if you're not talented as Harry. He can sing, he can act, he has charms and he's good looking.  Rather than being negative about it and if you can't say one good thing about his hard work, then you can swallow your judgmental words back.  He didn't get to this position easily, he worked hard for it. It's easy for you people to say negative things about him because that's what you do best, right?  I'm a directioner and I'm not saying this because I am so. I respect Harry for whatever he's doing and I wish him best.  If you narrow minded people can't accept someone's job, hard work then you can just shut it for a change.  And instead of insulting someone's work and wishing it doesn't come out good, you're not doing a good job at it.

Its clear some of the other viewers below are disappointed at the lack of  gungho explosions and clich'ed comments that litter most modern action films The beauty of Dunkirk was the reaction of the civilians in the UK who downed tools and took every ship, fishing boat, yacht they could find to save the soldiers stuck in dunkirk.......its also about the bravery of a rear guard action (french and brits) who knew they were doomed but chose to fight in order to protect the evacuation Nolan is clearly taking the history behind this event very seriously and rightly so.  Americans wont be happy because no americans were involved in this event and yet it was one of the most defining moments of WW2. If the UK had lost 300,000 men here they would have possibly capitulated leaving only the Russian Front for the Nazis to concentrate on. On paper it was a defeat but in reality the extraordinary evacuation was a victory Remember that a huge german army , most of the luftwaffe and german navy was tied up on this front.......could Russia have survived alone ??",1,0,Alex Millward,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.10600198412698413,2016-12-14 21:17:34,True,True

The collection she had amassed was tightly chaotic, and squeezed into a wooden shelving grid. Glass before glass housed the swirling nexuses, corked, labelled, and snowed over with dust and dirt. Her collection had begun on some hellish night mired in trembling uncertainty. Sara had loomed upon the man next to her, and siphoned the squirming nexus from his chest. The small collection she amassed subsequently was a matter of curiosity, yet the beauty, and the warmth of innocence Sara felt as she held a full bottle in her hand had gleaned her persistence. Sara lit a cigarette and inhaled. The ashes crumbled amongst the dead-ends, piled high over the edge of the worn tin bowl. The mingling stale air and tobacco smelt of cold tranquillity, bittersweet but gentle - the same endless solitude as a lifeless winter morning. From above, Sara levelled her gaze to the squabbling crows, their chatters crushed by the wealth of empty space in the courtyard. Such simple creatures knew no malice. She could induce it in them, summon up their bubbling vomit to purge their best intentions. Emptying the animal before reconstituting it ‚Äì set with the ghosts of war drums‚Äô pounding malevolence inside its mind. Sara bellowed at the crows, ‚ÄúShit is a naughty word.‚Äù They seemed to flutter away in union, as such to prove to Sara that the crows were indeed feeling guilty about swearing. All children should learn these lessons; to be polite, genuine, and if you‚Äôre not I swear down mate I will come and scald your face with a freshly cooked pancake. I came top of my class in the navy seals and have over one thousand confirmed Wimbledon Timbledons. Sara‚Äôs basic instinct was one of profound friendliness, but when you do shit like this it makes me want to hurl.

Harry Styles has been a singer for the some years now, and him acting is very new. We are here to support him. And who do you think we are?? Of course we take our history into consideration!! This based off a war, where people's lives were lost fighting for their Countries! Not to mention that this movie looks really good and interesting? Dunkirk is made by a director who has made really popular movies. For one, I really enjoyed interstellar.

2016-12-15T02:14:50,"okay, Harry Styles is in it, big deal. Hell, that's how I knew this movie was happening in the first place. Yeah some people are watching it for him (mostly me but I also really like WWII movies and the whole history anyway, plus I can see the movie if it's rated R anyway), but it's been stated by several of the costars that Harry is a great actor and Christopher Nolan said himself that Harry worked for that part and auditioned for it and he got it because he was good, so everyone just needs to give him a chance. I'd also like to comment that most of his fans would want you to be quiet anyway so they can hear everything he's saying and doing. Sure you might get childish fans, but learn to chill. when you're a fan, you get an overwhelming sense of pride that he's doing something to big (it's a Nolan film, that's huge actually), but just learn to be patient and have compassion for people.

Well, guess what - *they're annoyed because this movie is about a heck of a lot more than one little teen pop star, and not only does his presence appear to be distracting from an honest discussion of the merits of the trailer's filmmaking and acting, it also seems to be over-shadowing absolutely everything else about it, including the most important aspect, which is the historical importance of the film.* The fact that One Direction fans are calling other commenters ""hurt and triggered"" and saying the movie's profit will be because of him is pretty rich, and it is exactly what pisses people off, because it is arrogant and hypocritical. *Your fan base is capable of some of the most 'hurt and triggered' behaviour out there - you are the ones who sob when a member leaves your favourite band, so until you guys prove that you have enough collective maturity to actually respect a film like this because you want to find out about a true historical story of bravery and loss, rather than weep over the new hair style of your crush in his few scenes, then shall you be given an iota of respect, and not before.* I am a millennial too, and I do not endorse all the crap thrown at millennials - I think we work hard in a society which is against us like never before with an atrocious job and housing market, *but the reason millennials get shit on is the prominence of people like the One Direction fans.* I don't despise that you have your teen idols - what I and others despise is that with that can come a massive amount of vapid shallowness, a lack of intelligent knowledge of and interest in the world around you and its history. *The world is about SO much more than the Kardashians and Harry Styles - it is about sacrifice, and loss, and suffering, and bravery, and hope, and you need to grow up and participate in those things.* Get off of twitter and facebook, and spend some time each night reading a good novel that you'll enjoy, but one with some historical substance. Not only will your brain grow and your grades improve, but you will become a better, more well-rounded person because you will LEARN and you will THINK! *Have your fun, listen to your favourite band and enjoy it, but know that the reason you are living in a free world is because of brave men like the ones in the Dunkirk trailer, know that you owe them your respect, and know that if you are ever going to get that same respect from the rest of the world that you too will have to grow up, be smart, and demonstrate to everyone that you are more than a shallow young girl obsessed with twitter. Be more, think more.*  You are better than the standards which have been set for you, and you need to recognize and embrace that maturity, intelligence, and understanding to be able to ever get the respect that you seem to crave. Until then, and justly so, you will be looked upon as a shallow fan of a shallow band.",1000,114,oldmoviemusic,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.09304280489625318,2016-12-15 02:56:07,True,True

Although they were able to rescue around 350,000 out of 400,000 men trapped on the coast, 50,000 men would die.

Or think about the fear some of these men must've felt, thinking they were facing imminent death at the hands of a merciless evil. Right before the events of Dunkirk 97 wounded British soldiers were captured by SS and put up against a wall then machine gunned down, remember them when you watch this, not who the people are who are gonna see it or for what reason, not for whose in the movie or who is directing it, but for what it is depicting, remember the bravery of the men who died at Dunkirk and the Les Paradis Massacre or The Battle of France, remember the evil that your ancestors had to face and the price they payed for your freedom.",8,0,carson,F-eMt3SrfFU,-0.08915343915343914,2016-12-15 04:47:35,True,True

2016-12-15T05:08:22,"I'm excited to watch this movie and learn about the history and story of this event. If I'm being honest, the reason that I heard about this movie was because of Harry Styles and I'm a fan of him, but I've noticed a lot of immature comments about one another in this comment section. For example, non-Directioners are being insulting and attacking just because we are fans of Harry. Most of us who are fans are also very interested in actually learning about the movie's historical background as well. It's extremely disappointing to hear people telling us to ""kill ourselves"", ""get the f*** out"", or to ""get our arrogant little a**es out of here."" Everyone is saying how ""immature and stupid"" we are, but in reality, they're being just as arrogant and immature as us too. I'm not saying that it's ok for girls to watch this movie only for the reason that Harry Styles is in it, but we should definitely be given a chance to watch the trailer in peace without being attacked by many others in the comment section. I see this all as a great opportunity for young girls (and boys as well) to be educated about what happened at Dunkirk. I think we all just need to be more mature, grow up, get over ourselves, and enjoy this trailer regardless of any reason we are here. The actors/actresses in this film have probably worked their butts off trying to make this movie the best it can be, and I'm pretty sure they'd be offended by reading many of these comments.

I'm not a fan of One Direction and never have been but the thought that a teen pop star taking the career move to a gritty biopic actor peaked my curiosity and after watching this trailer, and completely forgetting about Harry Styles I'm genuinely interested in this film and can't wait to see it in theatres, come summer 2017.  But to all of you man child's (men children?) kicking up a fuss in the comments section about the rabid Harry Styles fan girls talking about this film, get a fucking life; you must remember that he's their favourite celebrity and seeing him in something other than an interview or music video is exciting to them. Everyone has a favourite celebrity that they feel giddy about when they release a new song or star in a new movie, it's normal for teens and young adults to have celebrity idols. I don't really know where I'm going with this but whatever... so don't act like this kind of mainstream media attention is in any way toxic or corruptive to the movie's success if anything this will help the movie in terms of profit and possibly reviews; sure it's not some exclusive nerd thing now that there's a pop star in it but not everything good is exclusive, if it's not a good movie then it's not a good movie but that's not because of the cast.

And I'm actually very interested in the history of World War II so that's another reason for me wanting to see it 2. If I see one more person say Harry only got the role because of who he is please don't come near me or I might EXPLODE WIITH ANNOYANCE. The casting director said himself that was one of the obstacles Harry had to face. They were thinking of not casting him so as not to send the wrong message. HE WORKED HIS ASS OFF TO GET THAT ROLE. Harry went back and forth between two cities to audition now does that sound easy to you? He was chosen because of how much he wanted it and how hard he worked.

Just because their uniforms are from World War l doesn't mean that it's World War l. You can obviously tell it's WWll by the planes. Also The Battle of Dunkirk was in WWll.

Why does it suddenly hurt you?  2) Please don't judge his acting skills before actually watching this movie. If he's bad, then im sure most of us will accept it and laugh it off and be proud of him for even trying. 3) Why is it that if we're excited about harry, we cant possibly be excited about the movie itself? why do you think we wont be able to appreciate Christopher Nolan or the historic value in this?  4) Why does it matter to you? If there's anyone it should matter to, its the rest of the cast and film people. And you know what? Im sure they're fine with us being excited about him because im sure they know he's a great guy and at the end if the day,  all it means, is more money for them.   So please just stop being killjoys and haters and just go about your own business. I hope you realise that you're arguing with 13-25 year olds.

It's funny how you all discriminate directioners as whiny little 13 year olds, but who's whining now? Don't make a small problem bigger than it already is. Harry Styles has been latched onto our directioner hearts for almost 6 years. Let us have our moment to support him, cry for him, or even scream for him in the movie. Let's respect each other. I bet all of your moms have had this type of boy band or somewhat infatuation for people who dont even know her, but still you dont even have the guts to say all these type of words infront of her.

Many visit Normandy, but it is absolutely worth visiting Dunkerque. The path of WW2 was changed with the bombing of the Blockhaus D'Eperlecques near St Omer. the V2 factory and fuel production facility (which we have visited).

Anyways, the only reason all 400k British Soldiers didn't die there was because Hitler commanded his Generals to halt the attack, despite their pleading with him to press on and destroy them. They could have forced surrender at Dunkirk if they had pressed on, but luckily Hitler's hubris prevented that from happening.

I understand it may seem annoying people are saying 'I'm only here for Harry', but in the end, all that means is more people are coming and seeing the movie, and they will become informed about what happened at Dunkirk. They may walk out of the theaters and say 'wow, I never knew this before, let me look more into what happened' and I think that's incredibly important, it's educating people so they know what happened at Dunkirk.

But what I'm trying to say is, Directioners, it's fine to support Harry, but remember that this movie isn't about him, it's about a historical event that took place during World War 2.

It's his fucking choice who's going to be in the film. And if you guys are thinking he got harry for publicity for the movie, THEN AGAIN NOLAN IS directing the movie and that is enough publicity. Why cant we just watch the movie and be OPEN MINDED and stop discriminating because i feel like people are going to be squinting at girls in the movie theater amd going to judge them as 'hormonal teenagers who jist wsnt to jack off to fucking harry styles who's going to be drowning anyways which is good'. Let's just all have a good time and be mature about all this.   Because the only issue i see in here is that harry being in the film. A guy who happens to be from a boy band WHO HAPPENS to be trying out acting and i see nothing wrong with that.

When this movie depicts a chunk of insight about the WW2 and how Christopher Nolan would smash this again. I'm sorry to the Harry girls out there even though I'm also one, this movie wouldn't be known because of the impact of the plot behind the story, but fangirls seeing Harry Styles acting. They're all worried about Harry Styles getting killed and all, well also a lot of people died here. Not only Harry, if ever. You kinda like over shadow other actors acting by focusing on to one thing and that's unfair. I'm a WW2 junkie, and I've known this to be made before Harry Styles was casted because of Benedict Cumberbatch's series potrayal of Dunkirk many years ago.   If you're gonna go into the cinema, refrain yourself from squealing and being over joyed about seeing Harry because this is not about Harry. This is about our history and we should respect it as other audience are not there to focus on one thing but the plot and everything else. Please, I beg you, let's be mature about this. Honestly I'm a big fan. I love Harry Styles since boot camp, but making Harry seem more important than other characters is just... Not right.   PLEASE DIRECTIONERS, LET'S BE MATURE ABOUT THIS, I know you're all excited but this isn't all about Harry,'kay? I'm not hating or anything, I'm just saying so people wouldn't be discourage in watching this. Because some of them are actually interested in the story.

The Syrian refugee crisis. This is a terrible thing that is happening because groups in Syria are fighting. Then multiple terrorist groups enter the area to take advantage of the war. Groups like ISIS don't care who they kill. They kill people who disagree with their extreme views. Because of this, people like you and I are fleeing from their country to other countries that will let refugees in. Sometimes they need to travel across the water in tiny boats with hundreds of other people on them. On these boats, people fall off and drown. Others starve or get sick. Personally, I think we aren't doing enough to help these people. By ""us"", I mean the U.S., other countries and everyday people like you and me. To raise awareness send, comment, text, email or share these hashtags: #WeCanHelpSyrianRefugees | #SRC | #StableSyria | #SyrianRefugeeCrisis Keep in mind, kids can help spread awareness too. I know this because I am 10 years old and I am in 5th Grade.

They probably don't even know that Hitlers Lighting War tactics took over France so quickly that the British had called a mass evacuation of their troops.

2016-12-16T12:37:40,"The reality of Dunkirk in May 1940:  On 22 May, Churchill's Cabinet decided to retire the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) from France. Anthony Eden formally ordered the commander of the BEF, General Lord Gort, to deceive his Allies about the British Army's intention to retreat. Churchill contributed to the deception by reassuring French Premier Reynaud that Britain was firmly committed to victory. Even as the British prepared to evacuate, they tried to convince the Belgians to continue to fight. The Belgians did remain on the field of battle for an additional five days, which delayed the advance of German Army Group B toward Dunkirk. As the author points out, ""Far from being betrayed by their Allies, the British military commanders in France and Belgium practiced on them a methodical deception which enabled the British to get away with their rear defended.""  Lord Gort was instructed not to inform his French and Belgian colleagues that the evacuation was beginning. South-east of Dunkirk the British withdrew their units, leaving seven French divisions alone to face the advancing Germans. The French fought on until their ammunition was exhausted and managed, like the Belgians, to tie down German forces that would otherwise have been available to assault the perimeter of Dunkirk.  http://www.historiography-project.com/jhrchives/v02/v02p375_Lutton.php",0,1,arno222444,F-eMt3SrfFU,-0.016081871345029242,2016-12-16 12:37:40,True,True

I've often thought the quality of 35mm film was way overrated - many movies released on bluray that were originally shot on film don't look good at all. Faded colors, warped images, flickering, distracting grain - that kind of stuff. And I've really come to appreciate the significant improvements digital capture has made in the last decade - thank you very much, people at Red and Arri. Great job! But seeing this, I can understand why Nolan still has a thing for film. Last years The Force Awakens (shot on 35mm film) was absolute reference quality. This one looks the shiznitts, too. And the quality of 15perf70 'true' IMAX was never under debate anyway. I wonder how the 65mm film shot segments in Dunkirk will look compared to the 65mm digitally Arri Alexa captured Rogue One. It's great that Hollywood is using the large formats again and directors have a choice. Perhaps we'll even see the resurgence of three-strip Technicolor.

2016-12-16T16:37:33,"Key facts about the true story   Dunkirk evacuation code-named Operation Dynamo, which took its name from the dynamo room that provided electricity in the naval headquarters below Dover Castle, where Vice Admiral Bertram Ramsay planned the operation.  Real 1st watershed of the war leading to german final defeat : with BEF crushing, UK had no chance to stop invasion and would probably had to ask Armistice, even with Churchill‚Äôs incredible willingness to fight.   3 main causes of this ‚Äúmiracle of Dunkerque‚Äù that saved UK (and so finally ‚Äúshaped our world‚Äù as the trailer says) :  - Haltbefehl : astonishing german decision to halt their Panzers Divisions on 24 May, at the moment they were about to crush Allies in Dunkerque quite easily. To explain this first huge german mistake, majority of historians now agree to say it came from Rundstedt‚Äôs /Hitler‚Äôs fear to loose precious Panzers for the last phase of the battle, Fall Rot ‚Äì crushing of remaining French forces in the south, combined to Goering‚Äôs boastfulness who claimed his Luftwaffe was sufficient to stop the evacuation.  Alternative theory based on so-called Hitler‚Äôs indulgence for England seems to be post-rationalization for his fatal mistake.  - Hero√Øsm of RAF & Allies‚Äô fleet, mainly British, who managed to evacuate 338 000 soldiers on 400 000, vs 45 000 only expected to be saved at the beginning. Role of Dutch coasters, which saved 23 000 men, must be mentioned.   - Often forgotten sacrifice (probably not evoked in the movie) of 30 000 french soldiers of 7th Army, who defended Dunkerque‚Äôs perimeter and so managed  to cover evacuation, despite hopeless outnumber - around 1 vs 10 ratio.    ////Anyway good news to see for once a big movie produced by a big American studio, about WWII warfare not involving US (War didn‚Äôt start with Pearl Harbor!)",0,0,Mathieu CRETON,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.17939560439560442,2016-12-16 16:37:33,True,True

Harry acting in it is just a bonus for me; one of my favorite idols being apart of a film about one of my favorite topics. I agree that someone shouldn't watch it just because and big star is in it, but for the story of the film is about. But him being apart of it will have and young generation wanting to watch it. Most likely some fans that go to watch don't like history all that much, or don't find very interesting. But with a star they look up to, it could get them to be more interested in the history of Dunkirk and WWII. I mean anyone can watch it for what ever reason they want, but no one should be hating the fact that there are 1d fans out there going watching the film because Harry is in it. If anything you're hating on the fact that there are fans going out to support Harry and his acting career (and learning about Dunkirk at the same time), and there is nothing wrong with them doing that. We all want to watch it for different reasons and there's nothing wrong someone wanting to do the same thing as you, for a different reasons.

The movie seems pretty generic and I am worried about its accuracy since it depict actual events and, as a blockbuster, appears intent to cater to the lowest common denominator.  I guess, it could still work if it focuses mainly on fictional people, like ""Private Ryan"", and stay somewat ""small-sized"" but please don't do blockbusters focused on real-life events, less you spread oversimplistic ideas and interpretations no better than flat lies (like religions).

And if you're a grown adult doing that you're not a grown adult at all you're acting like you're 10. You're acting so immature grow up and get a life. So what if Directioners like myself are going to see the movie because of Harry. Directioners are supporting him because we want him to have an acting career. And you know what a lot of people go see movies just because of their favorite actor or actress is in it. If you're a hater hating on us Directioners for going to see the movie because of Harry and you go see a movie just because your favorite actor or actress is in it you should hate on yourself and you're contradicting yourself you hypocrite. Leave Harry alone he doesn't deserve the hate. He's human just like the rest of us. He has feelings too.

The more ambitious his scope has become, the thinner he's stretched himself, and his writing has suffered because of it.  That's where the major complaints about Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar really stem from, and I think Dunkirk, being a biopic, has the potential to keep Nolan more grounded.  The event already happened and the plot's already written for him.  Plus, we already have a sense of the cinematic scale and the expectation of practical effects and an ensemble cast, both of veterans and newcomers (very fitting for a war film).  He just needs to deliver on the reaction to the event and the humanity that came out of it and he'll have made a great film through and through once again.",2,0,tss3393,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.25113636363636366,2016-12-30 14:48:11,True,True

2017-01-02T16:30:12,"The idea of the Germans somehow destroying the Allied forces at Dunkirk is rather overplayed as a what-if.  Keep in mind that the ground around Dunkirk was pretty bad for armour, and the British had a large amount of anti-tank guns in play, plus Royal Navy warships offshore and RAF air cover. Putting in such an attack regardless would probably destroy many of the best German formations as viable units, putting the Fall of France very much in doubt. The Germans were also low on logistics such as fuel and ammo, but they were also low on spare parts, and of their vehicles were on the verge of becoming mechanical casualties. Early war tanks were not fantastically reliable compared to today's. On top of that, they didn't have much in the way of things like artillery support, because they'd outrun that as well. The British, in contrast, had fallen back onto their supply lines, so they were well supplied with everything, on top of potential support from the Royal Navy and RAF from the other side of the channel if things got dire enough.  Hell, to put it in a little more details, Dunkirk itself was terrible tank country to begin with, being surrounded by boggy grounds, marshes and protected along much of the outside of town by a large canal. The British had so many troops trapped there that they could afford to be strong everywhere; there was nowhere to outflank them, the only way in was a direct frontal assault. Dug in around the perimeter were several hundred QF 3.7"" AA guns, the British answer to the German FlaK 88. Those weren't suitable for AT use in the field, like the 88s, because they were heavier and the carriages weren't really well designed for it, but in a situation where they wouldn't have to be moved, they were just as deadly. Any German armoured attack would have ended up literally bogged down, in the open, right in the sights of all of those guns, and then they would have reached the canal and been unable to cross. It was, really, an incredibly strong defensive position, and the British were evacuating troops from there even before von Rundstedt halted.  The only way to swing it is for the British to surrender on account of the 'hopeless' situation, which isn't exactly inconceivable (they did it at Singapore, for example, despite being in a much stronger position relative to the Japanese invasion force). The BEF actually being destroyed militarily by the German forces facing it at that point is unlikely in the extreme as said before once they get support from the Royal Navy and RAF if things get dicey for the British.",5,0,ProjectSun,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.054728521038044854,2017-01-02 16:30:12,True,True

I'm obsessed with the events of WWII and I was made to believe that the only reason Hitler ordered them to hault was because the terrain was too bad for the tanks to try and go across and he didn't want to get precious tanks stuck in mud or damaged so instead, he sent a massive bombardment of artillery and planes to attack the troops on the beach of Dunkirk. After the constant bombings, he then ordered just infantry to pursue to the beach but the French army acted as a sacrifice while the Germans were making their way to Dunkirk in Lille (look up the Siege of Lille), the French army basically knew they had no chance in stopping Germany coming through but it gave the remaining troops on Dunkirk time to escape.   Also, people saying that Hitler offered peace with Britain while they were stuck on Dunkirk is rubbish too. It's a fact that Hitler only offered peace to the Allies once the Allies took back control of France and Holland, and by that time, Germany was surrounded mainly by the Russians, but also by the American, British, French, Canadian, etc.",49,36,Dan Riddy,F-eMt3SrfFU,-0.0784313725490196,2017-01-19 02:44:35,True,True

Germany could have used their airforce at Dunkirk and tried but that did not go all their own way, neither did they rule the sea. Crucially, very importantly, Hitler did not know that an agreement with Britain was impossible at the time of Dunkirk. There were many discussions with many people. This was not just about Churchill as many say. There were many forces at work. Some genuine, some to trick Germany.

As in, what the fuck have you created as special and moving as Nolan's films have been, to think you know better? Are you Francis F. Coppola? David Lynch? Or maybe the reanimated corpse Stanley Kubrick? I didn't think so. I only learned of 1 Direction and this member named Harry from the buzz surrounding Nolan's newest project, and like most people who have interest in these historical films, or are fans of Nolan's work, probably don't think so highly of these new ""pop"" bands, which in my opinion are shitting all over the fundamentals of music, yet as stated above, Nolan wouldn't blindly pluck a man from mainstream success in hopes of generating more buzz around a project, since he already had people buzzing around his next ORIGINAL film (not Batman), since we walked out of theater thinking if the top fell or kept spinning right before the credits rolled in Inception.

2017-05-16T00:25:27,"In one of the most widely debated decisions of the war, the Germans halted their advance on Dunkirk. Contrary to popular belief, what became known as the ""Halt Order"" did not originate with Adolf Hitler. Field Marshals Gerd von Rundstedt and G√ºnther von Kluge suggested that the German forces around the Dunkirk pocket should cease their advance on the port and consolidate, to avoid an Allied breakout. Hitler sanctioned the order on 24 May with the support of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW). The army was to halt for three days, which gave the Allies sufficient time to organise the Dunkirk evacuation and build a defensive line. Despite the Allies' gloomy estimates of the situation, with Britain even discussing a conditional surrender to Germany, in the end more than 330,000 Allied troops were rescued.",1,0,curtis bowers,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.3,2017-05-16 00:25:27,True,True

2017-07-04T08:22:04,"A PG-13 rated war movie? Are you fucking kidding me? Has Nolan Ever seen a war movie? They're not supposed to be fun, light action movies. They're supposed to be realistic and brutal. They're supposed to have an impact on the audience. Nolan's first two movies, Memento and Insomnia, were rated R, and they were great. But it seems like Nolan thinks that since all his other movies were PG-13, that means PG-13 is the only way to go. Well all his previous movies just happen to work as PG-13, because they have no content that should be higher level, but this definitely will. And is Nolan really dumb enough to think an R rating will limit the audience? When I saw Deadpool, most people in the theater looked 12 years old. The fact that it was directed by Nolan means the theaters will be full of teens, regardless of the rating. Teens also seem to love war movies in general. But still, Nolan decided to severely reduce creativity in an attempt to make a little more money. This is going to be a bunch of watered down crap. When people die, they'll just look like they're passing out drunk. I thought Nolan was above this kind of bullshit. And it's a real shame, because Nolan is a great director, I'm sure he could've made a great war movie if he wasn't such a pussy. Fucking pathetic.

During the sinking of the Titanic, he stayed until the ship actually went down, and was pushed to the surface by the ship's ventilation. He joined men atop an overturned lifeboat and directed them on how to shift their weight until they were rescued. At Dunkirk, the Admiralty tried to take his ship, but like many of the captains of those little ships, Lightoller chose not to give it over, but to sail it there and back himself.

2017-07-10T05:28:16,"After holding off an SS company until their ammo was spent, 99 Royal Norfolk Regiment soldiers retreated to a farmhouse in the village of Paradis, just 50 miles from the Dunkirk port. Ships waited there to carry home the British Expeditionary Force, which had been fighting alongside the French in its defensive war against the German invaders. Agreeing to surrender, the trapped regiment started to file out of the farmhouse, waving a white flag tied to a bayonet. They were met by German machine-gun fire.  They tried again and the British regiment was ordered by an English-speaking German officer to an open field where they were searched and divested of everything from gas masks to cigarettes. They were then marched into a pit where machine guns had been placed in fixed positions. The German order came: ‚ÄúFire!‚Äù Those Brits who survived the machine-gun fire were either stabbed to death with bayonets or shot dead with pistols.  Of the 99 members of the regiment, only two survived, both privates: Albert Pooley and William O‚ÄôCallaghan. They lay among the dead until dark, then, in the middle of a rainstorm, they crawled to a farmhouse, where their wounds were tended. With nowhere else to go, they surrendered again to the Germans, who made them POWs. Pooley‚Äôs leg was so badly wounded he was repatriated to England in April 1943 in exchange for some wounded German soldiers. Upon his return to Britain, his story was not believed. Only when O‚ÄôCallaghan returned home and verified the story was a formal investigation made. Finally, after the war, a British military tribunal in Hamburg found the German officer who gave the ‚ÄúFire‚Äù order, Captain Fritz Knochlein, guilty of a war crime. He was hanged.",1,0,Jack Yasui,F-eMt3SrfFU,-0.08199999999999999,2017-07-10 05:28:16,True,True

Most notoriously was the case of the Wormhoudy massacre where nearly 100 British troops of the Warwickshire regiment were shot and grenaded by SS troops in a cow shed after they had fought to the last round.

Sadly, this one, as much as i wanted, wasn't one of them. I know you are here to make a movie, not only for the historical accuracy, and, maybe, to motivate more people to take interest in the people and nations that made our everyday life, in freedom and liberty, but also, so audience enjoys the movie, not only as a historical event, but also as a, well, movie. i am indeed excited, that you've made a movie about such an amazing event, but i am disapointed that you have casted a person who has a huge fan base, and that his own fans hate your original trailer, because it doesn't portrait him as much a they wanted, i am ofcourse speaking about Harry Styles. I would've liked if you had casted an entirely fresh face, a person with practically no fan base, or experience in the movie buisness, and ofcourse put that person in a side roll, and put a experieced veteran,(war joke), in the lead roll. If you Warner Bro's have put this ex-boyband person, in this roll, because you want his fanbase to watch the movie, i am deeply disapointed in you, you will probably deny, my accusasion, so i will probably never get a truthfull response, maybe not even get a simple response from you.

The French army defended the city heroically to defend the evacuating British troops who didn't defend their posts. 40000 french troops died defending them. Christopher Nolan chose to ignore their importance by only showing French troops for a couple of seconds and not even showing them as heroes but as scrounges. As a British person this film brings me shame as without the heroic French troops that gave their lives defending the retreating British troops then Dunkirk would have been a massacre.

What Christopher Nolan does here is: - He wants to put you in their shoes, the volume was really loud. Therefore it actually felt like you were there with them on the beach. - Barely any dialogue, which makes it a lot more interesting. For a brief moment when they were actually talking, shit hit the fan. Shit started to explode, people were being shot. It was horrific, but at the same time it was amazing. - Unexpected switches between characters infront of the camera. You really have to think whilst watching this movie or you will be lost and think the movie is boring (my girlfriend thought it sucked).  This movie gets a 9/10. Oscar-material?

His movies just have this real gross dissociated feel to them, like he just can't capture the essence of reality. For me it's like the uncanny valley of movie direction.

The film is shakey and mean, which provides the audience with a captivating and incredibly believable and lively perspective on the film, making them feel like they are in the horrific situation with the characters. The camera work is exceptionally vivid, clear, and wide making it easy to spot and distinct everything that is out on screen, such as the characters, action, shios, boats, planes, etc. There was not one moment in the film where I found it difficult to pinpoint details, even in the raw and chaotic sequences. There are a lot of beautiful, gorgeous, mind blowing, and powerful wide shots that are used in this, primarily because 70 + percent of the film was shot in Imax cameras. The wide range shots are some of the best I have ever seen..PERIOD! From the beaches, the cities, the ships, boats, sea, everything is shown so grand and beautiful, which really compliments and presents the incredible cinematography and spectacle this movie truley is. This movie is also 100 percent realistic. Real people, real planes, real boats, real ships, and real sea and ocean. In fact this movie was actually FILMED IN DUNKIRK! It all looks so amazing, and movies should take note of Christopher Nolans work here. However, to me where the camera work really shines and revolutionizes filmakimg today are the close quarter shots. Oh my God I have never been so allured, captured, invested, blown away, and grateful for camera work such as this! These close quarter shots grab, pull, and lure you into these scenes! My lord it was ju s incredible and I have never experienced anything like it before! Every time they paned into a character (s), boats, planes, ships, underwater, explosions etc, it was soooooo whiteknuckling and intense! It was done so old school but fresh and modern at the same time! I have no words to describe how brutal and intense it was when it was close quarters I really don't! You feel like you are struggling for survival with them and you yourself feel like you are in parell. Scenes and shots like these make you feel fear, anxiety, pain frustration, nervousness and hoplessness, and that just about sums up Dunkirk. When men are jumping into the water and swimming for their lives, bombs are dropping in every corner, ships are sinking, planes are up in the air fighting for their lives, people that are inside of a ship have no way out and are struggling to escape.....you feel like you are there with them every step of the way. This tells you how much of a technical triumph Dunkirk is, and it is all practical. This proves why practical effects, if done right, will always give you the best experience you will ever get, and this is one of it not the best technical film ever made.     CONGRADULATIONS TO THE CAST OF DUNKIRK! WHAT AN AMAZING CAST! This is beautiful just beautiful! Thank you to every single one of these people involved in this incredible and beautiful project! Every single one of these incredibly talented people bonded together to give us sonething unlike anything we have ever seen before, and Iam not forgetting about the two amazing actors that are Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy who did an incredible job on this film! Ladies and Gentleman the incredible and heartpounding Dunkirk is one of the best experiences you will ever have! Words like thrilling, heartpounding, intense, emotional, suspensful and much more!      This film is chaotic, white knuckling, exciting, incredible, mezmerizing, and beautiful are in my vocabulary! This is one of the best war films ever made, one of the best movies in years! Hell this might even be my favorite war film ever, or the best! I have to think about that for a while, but there is no doubt this is one of the best war films ever, and the best cinematic experience you have ever had, or ever will have. This a once in a lifetime experience, and it is something unlike anything you have ever seen before! Dunkirk is not just a film, but an event every movie lover, or person in general, needs to watch! Dunkirk is one of the best films in a long time. It is a triumph in every way possible! I LOVED DUNKIRK BEYOND BELIEF! This is my favorite film of the year and one of my favorite films of all time! It gave me the best movie and cinematic experience I ever had, and I will never forget watching this incredible film in Imax! Dunkirk is absolutely incredible, mesmerizing, beautiful, gorgeous, thrilling, dramatic, chaotic, powerful, unique, tense, grand, emotional and breathtaking! I hate it when you look foward to a film so much, you watch it, you love it and than it is gone. You can always watch it again, and I will certainly do so, but that first time is classic original, and treasurable. This is my most memorable movie experience ever. DUNKIRK WILL ALWAYS HOLD A PLACE IN MY HEART! THIS FILM BROUGHT ME INTO TEARS! I will never forget Dunkirk and the once in a lifetime experience I had watching this film. This is a masterpiece in my book. Christopher Nolan you did it again you Legend. One of the greatest filmakers in history, and the best filmakers around. And everyone do youselves a favor and WATCH THIS FIL. IN IMAX! IT IS WORTH IT TRUST ME! This movie is made for Imax, and you quickly realize this when you watch the movie. Iam telling you, if you want the best experience you have ever had, and want to watch Dunkirk, watch it in Imax, and be prepared to be bloooown out of the water! You will never forget it. I certainlly will not. Thank you all for giving us this beautiful art. This is the biggest movie event of the year everyone!

It took a major historical event laden with drama and turned it into a clown show. I've never seen a historical thriller turn a series of events that WE KNOW happened and make it utterly unbelievable. It didn't have to have composite characters created to add more drama: The drama is already there. So let me get this straight: The main character is the only one of six people to escape German machine gun fire in the streets of Dunkirk, then almost sneaks onto a boat (which then sinks), then tricks leadership into letting him onto another boat (which is torpedoed and then sinks), then sneakily grabs onto another boat to get taken to shore, then sneaks into the hull of another empty boat on the beach that - despite being full of bullet holes - is magically able to make it out to sea, but ultimately sinks next to another boat that is also sinking, only to be fortuitous enough to get picked up by a small passenger boat in the area that also managed to pick up a crashed RAF pilot and the only survivor of a torpedoed destroyer. Whoa, that is a lot of boats and one hell of a day! Saving Private Ryan did a great job of telling a fictional story that is believable; this tells a ""true"" story that is completely unbelievable.

Dunkirk it is not only the beach but also the city under the bombs (almost destroyed), the civilians trapped and scared, the ones who fought at the border knowing probably they were gonna die, the germans who were too close,  the ones  on the beach waiting and getting on the nerves, the ones who are coming to save them and  afraid to be too late, the ones who decided the operation dynamo.  At that moment, during few days,  dunkirk is really the end of a world,  it is the end of Europe as we used to know, it is doomsday. But there was also hope, it brought faith to the future.  The present was done, we had to fight for future, so we had to save many as we can.  And the ones at the border were fighting for that. And the ones on the boats were coming for that. Dunkirk is a miracle because of all those actions, because so many did what they had to do, soldiers, civilians, just humans but good ones.  I was certain Nolan could do with all of these, but no. He choose the artistical point of view ( and he did well) above history. And doing so, i think he choose facility as we already know his genius as a director. (telling such a story as dunkirk it must be really difficult but also really exciting for an artist, so i am disapointed).  And for all these reasons,  Nolan should have call his movie "" dynamo"" (for the operation) not dunkirk. (And be kind for my english, please, as it is not my native language).

Das franz√∂sische Volk, das englische Volk - das deutsche Volk wollte mit ihnen ja nun in Frieden und in Freundschaft leben. Es hat Forderungen, die diesen V√∂lkern ja auch nicht weh tun, die den V√∂lkern gar nichts nehmen. Das deutsche Volk ist daher auch nie zur Feindschaft erzogen worden. Da begann man in England nun von gewissen Kreisen aus mit dieser impertinenten unertr√§glichen Hieben. Und da kam der Augenblick, wo ich mir sagen mu√üte: Ich kann nun nicht mehr zusehen, sondern ich mu√ü diese Hetze jetzt beantworten. Denn wir erziehen das deutsche Volk in keinem Ha√ü gegen√ºber dem englischen. Wir erziehen es in keinem Ha√ü gegen√ºber dem franz√∂sischen, w√§hrend in England und in Frankreich die Hetzer Tag f√ºr Tag in der Presse und in den Versammlungen das britische und das franz√∂sische Volk in Wei√üglut bringen gegen√ºber dem deutschen!  Eines Tages werden die Hetzer die Regierung sein. Dann werden sie ihre Pl√§ne verwirklichen, und das deutsche Volk wird √ºberhaupt nicht wissen, wieso das nun kommt. So gab ich den Befehl, nunmehr das deutsche Volk √ºber diese Hetze aufzukl√§ren. Aber ich war von diesem Augenblick an auch entschlossen, wenn notwendig, die Verteidigung des Reiches so oder so sicherzustellen.      1939 haben nun diese Westm√§chte die Maske fallen lassen; sie haben Deutschland die Kriegserkl√§rung geschickt, trotz all unserer Versuche, trotz unseres Entgegenkommens. Sie geben es heute ganz ungeniert selber zu: Jawohl, Polen h√§tte wahrscheinlich eingewilligt, aber das wollten wir nicht. - Sie geben es heute zu, da√ü es m√∂glich gewesen w√§re, leicht eine Verst√§ndigung herbeizuf√ºhren. Aber sie wollten das nicht. Sie wollten den Krieg. Gut denn!!!! Das haben mir einst meine inneren Gegner auch gesagt. Ich habe ihnen auch so oft die Hand gegeben. Sie haben sie zur√ºckgesto√üen. Sie schrien auch: Nein, nicht Vers√∂hnung, nicht Verst√§ndigung, sondern Kampf! - GUT, SIE HABEN DEN KAMPF BEKOMMEN!

Although I understand the frustration that some got about this subject as it is frankly overlooked by many, I don't think that Dunkirk is the right movie for this.  It's not your average warmovie as it's doesn't show the whole situation with action but more what the few individuals saw. Would it be the civilians on their boat, the (RAF?) piloot or the infantrymen on the beach, the movie primarily shows their look upon the situation and their struggles. Not of the average British/French soldier. It doesn't show you what happened in the city, but more specific what happened in that time on the beach. That's what the movie is about. I mean no harm and hate towards the French resistance, their deeds shouldn't be forgotten as they're one of the primarily reasons that the British saw their homeland again. I just don't see it how you could merg it the rest of the movie.

2017-07-25T20:23:20,"Just got back from the movie, it's actually quite terrible. Easily Nolan's worst movie to date.  I'm not going to spoil the plot, although anyone familiar with history of the region already kind of knows. Aside from how this movie doesn't really have a plot that goes much beyond that anyway. (Yes be prepared for extremely minimalist dialogue for the most part, alongside non-linearity that destroys a sense of plot.)  The music in this is goddamn awful, the 'suspense shots' take forever to finally show what happens with a VERY annoying musical tone that simply does not end and the editing with flash backs to what is supposed to be happening simultaneously really completely destroys the movie's credibility. It feels incredibly fake. And it has a pretentious underlining to it that simply does not suit it. It might have worked had these scenes not taken forever.  It's not a good movie. It's actually pretty darn bad. It has a strong opening, but shortly after that it complete falls flat. Take it from me, the trailer is way better than the movie hinting at a lot more action. You will not really get a lot of action in this and what's there isn't quite very good or that interesting. Some scenes are interesting from a visual point of view, like some of the dogfighting and some of the wide shots on the beach.  But the actual dogfighting itself looks incredibly bad with the viewer wondering why the hell the pilot could not hit on the first try having a perfect line up with the target. Anyone who's ever flown or played a flight simulator would at least taken a shot. Not in this movie. No, in this movie they wanted to have the pilots line up at least three times, only to kind of hit the engines perfectly. Sorry, but that's not how dogfighting in reality goes. You will generally have a hard time lining up for a perfect shot. Whenever you come even remotely close, you will fire for sure. I don't care if they think bullet preservation was a thing (which it was), but this is not how you shoot down planes. Aside from that the number of German airplanes make no sense.  At this point in the war, the German airforce was actually pretty much superior in numbers. Not in a 3:1 kind of way, but rather a 10:1 kind of way. We don't see that at all. Instead we see random dogfights, which apparently are supposed to be close to the beach and boats, but really aren't taken there.   For a beach that had over 400.000 soldiers (in this movie only between maybe a 1000 to 5000 at best are ever shown) you would expect many more bodies. It would also make the 'duck on the beach' scene more plausible, because people would not be able to run anywhere with 400.000 people at the same spot. With maybe 500-1000 people though it looks painfully bad in how there would be room to run out of the firing cone of the attack fighters diving in from high up. It's bad. Why did they not use post-processing to add 100 times the amount of people here? They definitely should have.  And I can't believe how much modern day buildings, objects or items are still visible in this movie, including modern containers on the beach near the end. Holy fcking moly?! I think Christopher Nolan must not be very aware of what the older France looked like, because this stuff is really noticeable.  As far as the plot itself goes, they are on the beach and they get of the French beach aaand that's when the movie ends. I'm sure this was an important moment in history (hence Churchill's speech and some propaganda surrounding it at the time), but sadly it just does not work very well for a movie. I'm not even sure the movie does the whole thing justice in how scale of things was completely destroyed by a lack of people on the beach, lack of boats in numbers and so on.  I don't want to compare to Saving Private Ryan (as that's clearly less historical in many ways or rather more of a Hollywood approach to history if you will), but if you're expecting something with a story and the occasional action more along those lines, you're going to be GREATLY disappointed. Be prepared for a fairly boring movie, characters with which you kind of do not connect, all with their own series of events that are edited together in a rather poor way. I would not recommend this movie even for rental, it's that poor.  Oh, last but not least, the acting itself in this movie is alright. It's not spectacular but that's mostly due to how it's a bit light on dialogue anyway. My disliking of this movie has very little to do with the acting in this. There are some cringe worthy moments though, so don't expect the acting to save the movie. 4 out of 10, maybe 5 out of 10, definitely not more than that. Don't believe the 8,9 score nonsense. This movie does not come close.",1,0,PHeMoX,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.0699914717348928,2017-07-25 20:23:20,False,True

I don't understand the hype over this movie. I gave it a 7/10 at best, probably more like a 6 but i'm feeling generous. It looked stunning and the sound was great, Tom Hardy was top notch, there were some quite intense (but samey) moments, costumes and they way people looked we're good, and it started brilliantly, one of the best starts I've seen in a movie...   However there were a few problems i had with the movie. It was too cheesy and the acting suffered because of it. The historical inaccuracies made the movie pretty piss poor. If i'm watching a war movie, i want a good depiction of what it was like... mainly with the planes, they had endless amount of ammo, they couldn't have landed on sand, and there wasn't enough of them.  I feel like moving back and forth through time was unnecessary... There was no need for it, it didn't help with suspense, it was just there for the sake of it.  I couldn't care less about the characters.  There was a lack of violence/blood/limbs flying off lol, which i understand it isn't necessary, but this movie really needed it in my opinion.  Lastly it didn't give a great attention to threats. Yes there are planes dropping bombs, a few 'oh shit he is going to drown', but what about from the opposing side? Not one German was seen, and you didn't get a sense of struggle to hold the beach.

For someone who goes to the cinema regularly I highly recommend seeing dunkirk on the biggest screen possible because the film was made with 70mm & IMAX cameras with a small portion being filmed on 35mm (standard screens). The sound is breathtaking, particularly within IMAX, and I'd say more so than cheap IMAX showings like Spiderman Homecoming where that movie for instance was shot with 0% IMAX and just usual 35mm instead.

2017-07-29T10:10:19,"For all the people who weren't satisfied, here is Dunkirk in a nutshell - what it means as a film:  *May contain spoilers*  Click read more.       Dunkirk is only about British people! ‚Ä¢Dunkirk focuses on BRITAIN. It was made by British filmmakers so they will inevitably have a bias towards their own nation.  What's the point of Dunkirk? It's confusing! ‚Ä¢The film's focus is largely upon the ""Little Ships of Dunkirk"". The 700 civilian boats which sailed to Dunkirk from Ramsgate, England. Mark Rylance's character is meant to exhibit the selflessness of these individuals in their quest to save lives. This was the part of Dunkirk which is particularly special to British people. In Britain, people mention the ""Dunkirk Spirit"" as phrase which represents selflessness and a sense of duty. Nolan wanted people to understand this ""Spirit"", that's why at the end of the film, 3 of the main characters (The soldier from the beach, the Spitfire pilot and Mark Rylance) all end up in one of the little ships.  Why is it split into 3 stories? It's confusing! ‚Ä¢The film is split into 3 aspects (Planes, Beach and Ships) because Nolan wanted to display the role each of them had and their experiences and thoughts clearly. The soldiers on the beach are desperate to escape. The ships are desperate to save the soldiers. The planes are desperate to save the ships. At the end of the film, the 3 stories merge into one. That completes the story of Dunkirk.   Why are there no German soldiers? ‚Ä¢The Germans are never shown because Nolan wanted to create an overwhelming sense of fear. In other films like Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge, you can see your enemy and you know where they are. In Dunkirk, you never know where they will be. The opening scene where the soldiers run down the street and get shot shows this perfectly. They were just strolling down the street when out of nowhere the Germans opened fire. This is continued into the beach when people look to the sky in fear because of the Luftwaffe bombing them. That's why the Stuka bombers are so terrifying with that dive-bombing siren, because they come out of nowhere.   There are no French people! It's unfair!  ‚Ä¢The French were given a small amount of screen time but nonetheless some. The film focuses on Britain so they were always going to be in the background. The opening scene exhibits the French Army's fortifications at Dunkirk and how they held the Germans back as long as they could. The French soldiers on the beach trying to evacuate on a British ship were denied entry because the British ships serve Britain. France had their own evacuation ships and additionally, they would be evacuating from their own country. At least British soldiers were evacuating back to their homeland, not away from it. Regardless, many tens of thousands of evacuees were indeed French as on the characters portrayed, many French managed to get themselves onboard British ships, either by disguise or other methods. At the end of the film, Commander Bolton (Navy guy on the pier) repays the French because he refuses to evacuate with the Army Colonel and says he is staying behind for the French.   There is no dialogue! ‚Ä¢The film lacks much dialogue because it's focus is on actions. The film is very much about actions speak louder than words, hence the British civilian boats rescuing all the soldiers from the beach. They didn't whine or complain, they DID it. They, as Mark Rylance said ""have a job to do"". The soldiers don't speak much because it's meant to be more of representation of soldiers in general. The experience of the main soldier on the beach (The Mole), along with Harry Styles, is meant to represent the struggle of all 400,000 soldiers. It's not dedicated to an individual or their personality. It's not Hacksaw Ridge where the film is based on one specific guy and his life. It's based on the experience of 400,000 stranded soldiers.   There is not enough explosions or action! ‚Ä¢The film is sedate in its lack of explosions and action because it's meant to be realistic. Nolan himself is not one for explosions as most of his films use practical effects. Dunkirk is a film made to show duty and selflessness in the evacuation. It's not meant to have flashes and explosion. The plane scenes are made to be as realistic as possible. Tom Hardy only fires his Spitfire's cannons in short bursts. That ensures maximum accuracy. It's meant to be realistic, it's not Star Wars. He's not Han Solo and he's certainly not going to fly around and blast everyone into a fireball!  Why is it so confusing? I don't get the film? ‚Ä¢For people who don't UNDERSTAND the events of Dunkirk, it's no surprise that this film is confusing. It's not about knowing what happened. It's about understanding what's happening. That gets explained in the film but many people still don't understand it. The theme is the evacuation. 400,000 people stranded on a small beach, surrounded by the German army. They cannot stand their ground, their only option is to evacuate. They are only a few miles from their home, England, yet The Channel separates them. They were never going to make it home, that's why Churchill said he wanted 30,000-40,000 to make it back. That's roughly 350,000 DEAD. They didn't account for the civilian aid which they received. THAT'S what makes Dunkirk unique. Without them, they would have all DIED. The pleasure yachts, the fishermen, the crabbers, the weekend sailors and the all the rest of the 700 ships were the savours. That's how they got over 350,000 back alive. That's why it's such an incredibly important historical event. The fact that a group of people who could easily have sat at home decided to sail into gunfire, Luftwaffe planes, Kriegsmarine U-Boats and more is amazing. That's why Commander Bolton starts crying when he sees them. When the men couldn't get HOME. HOME CAME FOR THEM.  This whole theme and rescue ties in with something called the ""British Spirit"" (it probably doesn't exist any more - it probably died out somewhere towards the 1990s, possibly even the 1970s). The British never give up spirit. The ""We shall never surrender"", ""We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be"". That's how Britain üá¨üáß survived and won the War. Britain NEVER gave up, they went the extra mile. That's why the soldier on the train at the end reads out Churchill's never surrender speech. That's the theme - never give up, never surrender, we're all in it together.   This is why it's a confusing film for many non British people because they may not be familiar with the idea of the ""British spirit"" and so they don't understand the importance of the film and its message.",662,74,XxxULTIMATEZxxX,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.05918116605616605,2017-07-29 10:10:19,False,True

Having said that, this film was very underwhelming regardless of how historically accurate it is. Starting with the positives, this film is shot on beautiful film, has great props and wardrobe, it utilizes practical effects, has excellent sound effects, and has a musical score that drives the film. On the negative side of things the musical score drives the film forward constantly building you up, but once the build up stops you don't receive that satisfying of a conclusion. Very often the heavy accents and dialogue is difficult to understand, there's too many characters and none of them show any character development and lack character depth. Compared to Saving Private Ryan and or Pearl Harbor this film is really underwhelming in terms of action sequences. The best scenes visually are the flight sequences, bomb droppings, and even those are underwhelming. I also feel that if this film was rated R instead of PG-13 it could have added more realism. I feel like if this film would have shown the French soldiers who were also evacuated from Dunkirk and the French who sacrificed themselves to defend the city against a superior enemy in weaponry and numbers it could have fed my need for more action and the need to escape Dunkirk thus making the conclusion more satisfying.

As the enemy forces close in it seems the troops have nowhere to go, but help is at hand and a fierce battle ensues. - Written by Dik Nolan May/June 1940. 400,000 British soldiers are holed up in the French port town of Dunkirk. The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition. The situation looks dire and, in desperation, Britain sends civilian boats to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces. This is that story, seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two RAF fighter pilots and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet. - Written by grantss Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II. - Written by Robert Paege",0,0,greatones,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.029761904761904764,2017-07-29 21:05:05,False,True

Simply, a dreadfully scripted, produced and directed movie that only offers disrespect to the 100's of thousands of military involved in that theatre of war - known as Dunkirk.  Less than a B Grade Bollywood flick and obviously made on a shoe-string budget and by golly, it showed in spades.  CG graphics? - well there was none;  unless of course you count 6ft model planes crashing into the sea, 20 minutes spent in the hull of some old tug boat with unknown hostiles taking pot shots;  the ji, ji, ji ..tempo of the music was continuous and oppressive, something like that from Jaws, but never ending;  damn it,  the orchestral was probably the worst part and almost intolerable.  And where was the flotilla of 100's of tiny boats?  dah,; Dunkirk was about little people in little boats rescuing thousands and thousands of shattered troops!!  CG please!   For me, this was a wasted opportunity to create an epic movie and I think it would have been better to have never made Dunkirk, unless of course justice could have been done in the telling.  uuuugh, simply a wasted Sunday arvo and I am embarressed to have sat through it, based on the promise of an epic retelling, of all that was Dunkirk",15,2,India Rising,F-eMt3SrfFU,-0.07117583786231883,2017-07-30 06:00:27,False,True

When you sit and ask why they keep bringing up the past to try and glorify their victory in WWII or WWI, you wonder whether they really have the brains to understand that whilst they continue to bring out films like this and continue to obsess over the constant wars of yesteryear, that is part of the reason why we still have wars today.

You felt there was just three thousand men involved and not the half million French, English and the entire western German army right there and I simply felt underwhelmed.

No context or wider scope of the war effort was given... Yet another reason to not care about the actors.  5.

Focused carefully on the film as many critics seemed to dub this movie ""Nolans best film yet"", yet I found myself almost sleeping towards the end of the movie. What a load of shit. First of all, just because a movie has a well-known director directing it, does not mean it deserves such high ratings. Second, yeah it had pretty cinematography throughout the film, but it's 2017 guys. I've seen many more movies that have surpassed the scenic visuals this movie has presented. And this movie received so much better ratings for it's visuals. What a load of crap. Also, just because a movie isn't understandable at first does not mean it has some ""deep profound meaning"" behind the story. Let's face it, this movie made absolutely no sense with its plot direction. All I got from the story was that it displayed 3 points of view of any typical War film. Soldiers getting blown up, vehicles getting blown up, and the classical sad death scene of a prominent character.

But it could really have used a bit more plot and character development. The scenes where the german planes strafe bomb the beach were absolutely terrifying. Phenomenal stuff but there were only one or two of them which was a bit dissapointing. Other than that all the plane scenes are fantastic and the film has a very somber mood. A good entry in the chris nolan library, one which showcases his mastery of cinematography and the range of his talent, but does so at the expense of his complex and enjoyable plots and his penchant for mindbending and philosophical themes. Of all his films I think interstellar came the closest to marrying cinematography with his trademark writing style but just wasnt compact enough.

The trucks weren't treated very nicely either they were all left behind this wasn't a very good message.  All in all though a great movie if you like boats or planes.

The French were not the only ones defending the perimeter - there were several British regiments (eg Norfolks, Seaforth Highlanders, Gordons) who all went into captivity (if they weren't dead or bayoneted en route to Germany).  The French ""government"" didn't want their men evacuated at first.  When the British took the French off the beaches (leaving 100,000 approx of their own men behind) to the safety of England to form a Free French Army under de Gaulle, the French Government demanded they be returned, together with their rifles.  So, the allies lost 100,000 Brits and returned 110,00 French thanks to the bloody French Government.  The French should look at the behaviour of their Government at that time and the standard of their Generals, and stop blaming us for everything.  We gave the Free French a home and armaments, we supplied the French Resistance, de Gaulle was permitted to broadcast to France via the BBC, we sold our soul to America, and we crawled back up on to their beaches.  The Allies advance in 1944 was delayed waiting for the French so de Gaulle could march into Paris (quite an electioneering move) and thus liberate his capital.

For some reason this movie reminded me of a more modern portrayal of that, except instead of Normandy of course it was Dunkirk, and the cast of main characters smaller and only focusing really on the allied perspective (paritularly the English). I may be alone on this opinion and I understand there are many places where this movie differs from ""The Longest Day"", but this movie for me bridged what movies generally use to be (more dialogue and acting intensive), and what they are today (atmosphere and special effects). Not to say there aren't movies today that don't have one or movies then that don't have the other.  Oh and the people griping about the French not being portrayed, this is the movie Nolan chose to make, and his characters were mostly British.

The French were at home, and they knew that if Britain lost too many soldiers, the war was over and the world would be forced to live under the Third Reich. The French knew where the Germans were and how to get home if they were overcome. The British soldiers on the beach, however, were just waiting. They didn't know if they would get home. They had no idea how much time was left. It's like when you were a child, and were waiting for your mom to pull into the driveway after going to the store. She may have been gone for 30 minutes, but because you're not doing anything else but waiting, it feels like torture.

Dunkirk la nueva cinta de Christopher Nolan supon√≠a un paso en ascenso en su carrera , a mi juicio no creo que este sea el trabajo m√°s consolidado del cineasta. A√±o 1940, en plena II Guerra Mundial. En las playas de Dunkerque, cientos de miles de soldados de las tropas brit√°nicas y francesas se encuentran rodeados por el avance del ej√©rcito alem√°n, que ha invadido Francia. Atrapados en la playa, con el mar cort√°ndoles el paso, las tropas se enfrentan a una situaci√≥n angustiosa que empeora a medida que el enemigo se acerca. Cuando pensamos en Memento o El truco final , no quedan dudas de que el director puede hacer la pel√≠cula que quiera incluso hacer resurgir el mito de Batman con El caballero oscuro. Sin embargo a Nolan le faltaba una pel√≠cula hist√≥rica, un drama sobre la segunda guerra mundial y que mejor propuesta que Dunkirk. Decir que es una mala pel√≠cula ser√≠a injusto, tiene muchos m√©ritos, incluso grandes posibilidades de ganar el Oscar a mejor pel√≠cula, sin embargo no era lo que esperaba T√©cnicamente es una pel√≠cula impecable, la fotograf√≠a, el montaje y la producci√≥n en sentido general son de excelente factura. Dunkirk es una historia sobre sobrevivir en condiciones adversas, sobre el patriotismo , contada de manera simple sencilla. Si la puesta en escena es potente es realmente el compositor Hans Zimmer qui√©n se lleva realmente todos los elogios, incluso por encima del director Dunkirk no alcanzar√≠a ni la m√°s m√≠nima intensidad si no fuera por la exquisita banda sonora y el dise√±o de sonido de uno de los mejores compositores de la industria Demasiado larga para mi gusto, cansona , que no me emocion√≥ y que en todo momento me hizo extra√±ar al viejo Nolan Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Harry Styles y Tom Hardy, qui√©n nuevamente se tapa la boca se atienen a desempe√±ar sus personajes Sin excesos Le perdono Dunkirk a Nolan y espero que me deslumbre en sus pr√≥ximos proyectos como lo hiciera con Interstellar o Inception",0,0,gretter roman,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.016666666666666673,2017-12-18 16:39:22,False,False

Dunkirk is a terrible film which I wouldn't recommend to anyone. The only good aspects that came from it were the cinematography (which was phenomenal) and the overall soundtrack. Those are the only things I can complement this film on.",0,0,Virtual Warp,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.02352941176470588,2018-01-23 04:03:26,False,False

Only fear , despair ,anxiety about what is coming next , traumas , and everything that a human shouldnt experience. I felt it like i was there, with those soldiers. Hearth skiping a beat when hearing the sirens and the planes passing by  , the despair of the situation , the fear of never going back , the feeling of not knowing if you are gonna be alive within the next minute. The heavy atmosphere of everything , the time passing extremely slow , to the point of it being unsupportable . The sound of bombs and screams of suffering. This movie tricked me thinking i was there too in a way that ive never experienced.   Not only it succeeded to make me feel there , it also made me realize that we are lucky right now. I got a monstrous respect for the people who lived in those dark time. Its not human , we werent made to experience this. Its  beyond the limit. Its pure hell.   Look at us now , its like we forgot what humanity went through , we hate and insult each other for meaningless things like a tweet on the internet. We cry and blubber constantly while not seeing what we have right now and how lucky we are. We forgot what happened so we slowly are repeating the story until its too late. We are weak , so weak.

If they had done so, there would be no more  World War II, as England would have been left defenseless and easy to  invade and conquer, France would no longer have any forces with which to  fight, and Hitler would have been able to concentrate all his forces to  operation Barbarossa and crush the Russians.And then the famous  ‚ÄúHalt Order‚Äù came through the German forces. An order by which they  were instructed to halt for three days. For many of the historians that  have studied World War II, this is the most critical moment. It is the  order that actually changed the outcome of the war, allowed for the  Allied victory and cost the lives of 61,000,000 people.The  brilliant (strategically speaking) strategy of Field Marshal Manstein  and the execution by General Guderian of an attack through the Ardennes  and Sedan, bypass the famous Maginot Line and within 10 days split the  French Army in two, could have resulted in a pincer move that would have  encircled almost 600,000 allied soldiers, who would have no recourse  other than surrendering or be exterminated, if ir wasn‚Äôt for that  order.*",0,0,EDUARDO RIVADE,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.17268518518518516,2018-10-10 13:22:55,False,False

2019-01-01T23:50:09,"A bad film considering the facts that took place, i do not like miracles and other inaccuracies, not to mention the lies of our British propaganda aiming to come to terms with its historic past and its mistakes, This is not to serve the British youth !! the British say ""we grew up with Dunkirk spirit which is this sense of never surrender"" and yet it is exactly the first thing the British did in Dunkirk, surrender and give up ! The British also evoke what the British press called in 1940 the miracle of Dunkirk, but at war the miracles are not free, they are always the reward of a sacrifice and this time it was not a British one! Christopher Nolan's film, on the whole of his film, shows us only a small group of French soldiers on a barricade, distraught, and almost hostile ... and another French soldier cowardly and fleeing.......we call this British historical propaganda in action. You see i'm historian and i would appreciate that when credit is being taken that credit would be given to the source, and i think it's not worthy of telling the national history like this, twisting the facts, distorting the truth, this is an affront to the British national dignity considering what I will tell you below, which is the truth!   May 1940, the allied armies (French, British and Belgium) were trapped by a pincer movement performed by the Wehrmacht at north of the line Boulogne-Sedan. While French General Weygand was planning counter-attack, Lord Gort (chief of the British forces) decided to withdraw to Dunkirk hoping to sail back to England thus abandoning France to her fate. With bitterness, Weygand finally accepted to cover the British withdrawal named ""operation Dynamo"" and organized from Dover by Churchill and Admiral Ramsey. From May 24 to May 26, the exhausted Germans stopped their advance, allowing the allies to form a withdrawal corridor, then to organize a defense perimeter around Dunkirk. 400 000 allied soldiers were then encircled by 800 000 germans. The French and British navies gathered together to prepare the evacuation which began on May 27 supported by an armada of ""little ships"", private boats of all kinds coming from england (519) and France (300) and Netherland (29). May 28, Belgian King Leopold III (chief of the armies) surrendered, a decision highly criticized by the French and the British. On May 29, the germans launched their general offensive on the pocket of Dunkirk. 30 000 French soldiers, from 2500 to 6000 british and 160 000 germans were directly involved in the battle. The French defenses led by General Falgalde and Admiral Abrial held on....but the british lines quickly splited after the first skirmishes. Although the initial order from Dover had planned a total participation to the defense of Dunkirk, one count order said the evacuation was an absolute priority. Only the RAF took part in the defense of the Dunkirk pocket alongside the french airforce. In a talk with Fagalde and Abrial, British General Alexander confirmed that according to the order from Dover he could not engage his troop in the battle....he added that anyway ""his men are tired"" !....Understanding that the British would not participate in the close defense of the beachhead, Abrial answered to Alexander : ""My General, as there's no more way of relying on the english cooperation, the mission which was given to me will be performed by the sole French troops. We, the French are bound by an imperative mission of resisting until death to save as many troops as possible on the beachhead of Dunkirk. As long as this goal is not reached, we'll keep our positions!.""....British then withdrew and crammed on the beaches, waiting for their evacuation. Falgade managed to reorganize the defense before the germans taking advantage of the gap created by the British withdrawal. While in the sector of Lille, two hastily reorganized divisions of the 1st French army led by General Molinie held on for four days seven German divisions....among them three elite armoured divisions led by edwin Rommel. From May 28 to May 31, this epic resistance prevented the german reinforcements to advance towards the coast. Churchill wrote in his war memoirs: ""this gallant stand helped the beleaguered Anglo-French forces around the port to hold out for an additional two or three days and thus save at least 100 000 more troops"". May 30, combats then happened in Dunkirk and its outskirts. The city was under the continous fire of the german artillery and the Luftwaffe. Yet ""the french stood their line"" american historian Walter Lord pointed out. General Georg Von K√ºchler, who led the 18th army of the Wehrmacht wrote in his war diary: ""Despite our crushing superiority in numbers ans materials, the french counter-attack in many places....i don't manage to understand how these soldiers fighting in many places outnumbered one to twenty, still find the strenght to launch any assault, that's astounding, i find again in these French soldiers the same ardour of those of verdun in 1916, we can't penetrate anywhere, and suffer terrifying casualties."" Thanks to this great French resistance, the vacuation reached its peak during these dreadful days. On June 2nd, the last British soldiers were evacuated. The same day, General Janssen was killed while leading the French 12th DMI which repelled many german assaults since the Fort of Dunes showing ""an extraordinary heroism"" an officer of the 56th german Infantery Division said. The french then began withdrawing toward the beaches. The last evacuations under the pression of the Wehrmacht happened in an indescriptible chaos. Falgade, Abrial and Vice Admiral platon were in one of the very last convoys which managed to cross the channel. The last allied ship left Dunkirk on June 4th at 3a.m. and at 10a.m. fightings ended. 35 000 French soldiers who sacrified themselves fighting till the end were captured. Churchill and Ramsey had estimated at the beginninng of Operation Dynamo that a maximum from 30 000 to 40 000 men could be evacuated. It was finally 198 000 men (so almost the all the british professional soldiers) who could be sailed to england, among them the future marshals Alexander and Montgomery. 140 000 belgians and french could also be evacuated so in all 338 226 men ! The Royal Navy which evacuated 2/3 of the men, lost 112 ships in the operation, the French Navy lost 123 ships. The british force left behind a huge amount of heavy equipment. 90% of Dunkirk were destroyed, 3 000 dead and over 10 000 wounded were reported among the civilians. In nine days of fightings, the allies lost 18 219 men among them over 16 100 French. Yet, Operation Dynamo was considered as a great victory in Britain. saved from the pocket of Dunkirck, Lieutenant Bourles of the 71st Infantery Regiment spoke about his arrival in England: ""Having covered the reembarkation of the British we were considered as heroes, some young Englishmen asked us for an autograph and british officers saluted us with respect."" Most French soldiers were sent back to brest and Cherbourg a few hours after their arrival to carry on the battle of France against Germany and Italy. In these violent fightings of May-June 1940, Germany lost 160 000 men (as many as during the Normandy campaign of 1944), 1800 german tanks were destroyed or damaged and the Luftwaffe lost 50% of its strength, consequently, the Reich was very weakened (especially its Airforce) at the time of starting the battle of England. To British General Brooke ""it is hard to imagine how britain could have carried on the war without Dunkirk"". To Watler Lord, the battle of Dunkirk is a significant turning point of WW2, had Britain been vanquished, Germany would have been able to concentrate all its forces on Russia, Stalingrad and DDay would have never happened so.."" . General Heinz Guderian confirmed ""Dunkirk was a disatser for Germany"", Von Kl√ºcher wrote: ""Dunkirk is a reverse for us, almost all the British forces and a part of the French army have got away from us because some thousands of brave Frenchmen have blocked our way to the sea...Dunkirk brings me the evidence that the French soldiers is one of the best in the world resisting for ten days to our largely more numerous and powerful forces! The french Army probably saved Great Britain from the defeat, allowing their professional army to reach the english coast""...The following day of Operation Dynamo, british media invented the myth of ""Dunkirk spirit"" which emphasized the courage of the british in adversity, they also spoke of the ""Miracle of Dunkirk"". Yet there had been no miracle, only the courage and the great skill in combat of these forgotten French soldiers!",2,0,odeus predrinn,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.04337325349301397,2019-01-01 23:50:09,False,False

2019-07-08T16:04:42,"thanks to the French, without them no movie and not British army anymore. Thank you for your piece of shit propaganda.   40 000 french fighting against 160 000 germans to save 330 000 soldiers including 200 000 english. No mention about French in the movie. By the way Russians won the war against Germany  At least Germans are fair :             ""Despite our overwhelming superiority in men and hardware numbers, the french troops are counter-attacking in several places. I can't understand how those soldiers, sometimes fighting at one versus ten (or even one versus thirty in some areas), can find enough strength to assault us: this is simply amazing ! I see in those french soldiers the same energy than with the veterans of Verdun in 1916. For several days now, hundreds of bombers and guns are pounding the french defence. But, it's always the same thing: our infantry and panzers can't break through, despite some local and ephemeral successes. The french high command has very smartly set up his troops and artillery. I fear that the Dunkirk operation could be a failure for all of us: almost all the BEC and the biggest part of the french 1st Army will escape, because a few thousands of braves block the path to the sea. That's distressing, but that's it ! Dunkirk brings the proof that the french soldier is one of the best in the world. The french artillery, already dreaded in 1914, demonstrates once more its efficiency. Our losses are terrifying: numerous battallions have lost 60% of their men, sometimes even more ! By resisting ten days or more to our much bigger forces, the french army has accomplished, in Dunkirk, a superb achievement that you must pay tribute to. They have certainly saved Great-Britain from the defeat, by allowing the british professional army to reach the british coast.""

2019-12-20T14:36:20,"While I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan, I feel that he failed to capture the scope of the actual battle in his movie. While watching the movie, you get the sense that there were about a thousand men on the beach and a couple of isolated German aircraft. In reality, there were over 400,000 British men on the beach with over 300,000 that were evacuated,  and that's not counting tens of thousands of French soldiers! There were also hundreds of aircraft in the air strafing the soldiers, 177 British ships were sunk, and around 100,000 men killed or wounded on both sides. So please watch this movie again and tell me if it captures the scope of this event? No, it failed miserably! It's largely because of Nolan's obsession of filming everything ""as is"" and not using green screens and limiting special effects. Had he done that, he could have captured the sheer scale of this battle.",4,2,Gnosis7,F-eMt3SrfFU,-0.06904761904761904,2019-12-20 14:36:20,False,False

My point is at what point it makes you feel this as a war film. Its a ""survival film"" that has a war sequence at background, similar to titanic in which a love story happens in titanic's background. And they are telling that the film barely has any action sequences. Yes, that's what make this film unique. The film was a copy paste of the actual things happened in 'Dunkirk' back then. This was the statement given by those actual survivers of the event. Nolan tried his best to avoid melodrama, which popcorn crouching audience. All he expects was to make the audience to feel the situations happened over there.

On the other hand, the burning of demoralized young soldiers without war experience is well illustrated. The French army was left out with 40,000 colonial Moroccan soldiers who were terrified of the execution they had been lied to! Only marginally was it shown that the entire combat technology was abandoned in huge quantities, even heavy weapons, in a hurry and without a fight. In contrast, the evacuation was presented as a national feat! Wrong war - but still terrible.

Churchill said it himself : Without the work of the french soldiers and the Molinier general, it would be 100 000 british soldiers less, and a complete defeat. As a result : 197 000 british saved, and 140 000 french AND belgians saved. French and belgians only saved after the complete retreat of the british of course. The germans generals themselves said that France saved the british army in this battle.  So, i don't have any hatred for my english neighbours. But don't turn the real story as you want.

The English General Gort had received the order not to inform the French and Belgian generals of the beginning of the evacuation, leading besides to the retreat of the British troops to the south-east of Dunkirk, leaving seven French divisions alone facing the troops Germans who had to redeploy.

They are at the best cowards who run and try to hide amongst the proud english who are about to be rescued by the mighty royal navy. Of course they die at the end. Regarding Dunkerque the truth is very different :  1 - the English left the battlefield and retreated without prior notice to the French army ruining the french plan of a counter-attack (who is the coward?, the traitor?) 2 - the french army, and particularly the 12th infantry division sacrificed themselves to save time and allow the english, canadians, french and belgians to embark (338 000 men in total including about 100 000 french soldiers)  It is so sad that such wrong ideas about us continue to spread among the dominating anglo-saxon culture nowdays.

2020-05-19T20:06:02,"This film is a joke, and now the truth based on historical facts: when the German broke through the Maginot Line, the French fought alone and destroyed a large part of the German tanks and planes while the British army cowardly ran away back to England from Dunkirk. 234,000 British soldiers were saved thanks to the French army in what is called ‚ÄúOperation Dynamo‚Äù. The German said, ‚ÄúThe English will fight until the last French‚Äù... When the German attacked, the Allied Forces had planned a counterattack in Arras. But without telling the French and Belgian, the British Colonel Gort ordered his troops to withdraw to Dunkirk to go back to Britain in what was called ""Operation Dynamo"". If Colonel Gort, the British officer that started Operation Dynamo, had decided to fight with the French against the German instead of abandoning their allies, Hitler might have lost the war as soon as June 1940. Why? Because the French army alone managed to destroy about 50% of ALL the panzers that the Wehrmacht had, and the French and British Air Force managed to destroy 65% of ALL the planes that the Wehrmacht had. Hitler had taken a big risk, and put his entire military resources into this battle. On May 28th, Belgium capitulated. The French were left alone to fight against 120,000 German soldiers and 800 tanks, and managed to stop the German progression during four days, giving enough time to the British soldiers to evacuate and return to the UK. The French army eventually lost the battle on June 4th, because they couldn‚Äôt get any supply, and ran out of ammunition. And yet, the 137th French regiment, out of ammunition, didn‚Äôt even stop fighting, they attacked the German army with only their bayonets! Only 50 soldiers of the regiment survived. At the end of the battle, a German officer asked a French officer, ‚ÄúWhere are the British soldiers?‚Äù. The French officer answered ‚ÄúIn Britain‚Äù... Colonel W√§ger (= Waeger), German officer, was so impressed by the French defense that he allowed the captured French soldiers to parade with their rifles shouldered while the German soldiers saluted them! (picture: https://i.redd.it/ap0qhnlviuq41.jpg , https://www.quora.com/Why-did-German-general-Kurt-Waeger-grant-units-of-the-French-First-Army-of-G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral-Molini%C3%A9-the-honours-of-war-saluting-the-French-troops-as-they-marched-past-in-parade-formation-with-rifles-shouldered ) German General K√ºchler: ‚ÄúI find in these French soldiers the same ardour as those of Verdun in 1916. We've not been able to break through anywhere, and we are suffering terrifying losses...‚Äù Winston Churchill: ‚ÄúThese Frenchmen, under the gallant leadership of General Molini√©, had for four critical days contained no less than seven German divisions which otherwise could have joined in the assaults on the Dunkirk perimeter. This was a splendid contribution to the escape of their more fortunate comrades of the BEF‚Äù. After many British soldiers had already left the place, the British officers said ‚Äúoperation complete‚Äù... Churchill was the only one who insisted that the French soldiers should be saved as well after helping the Brits, and thanks to him about 100,000 French soldiers could be evacuated at the end of Operation Dynamo. Only a few hours later, the evacuated French soldiers sailed back to Brest and Cherbourg in France from England in order to go on fighting, while the British were celebrating their soldiers back home as if they had been victorious... On June 14th, the British launched Operation Ariel to withdraw all remaining British troops from France. Abandoned by their allies and left alone, P√©tain signed the armistice after several conferences with De Gaulle, Churchill and Weygand to find the best solution in this dismay and for the long term to avoid civil disorder and the possible rise of communists in Paris, while other ministers opposed to an armistice and wanted to go on fighting ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_P%C3%A9tain#Fall_of_France ). President Lebrun requested President Roosevelt for assistance in June 16, but the American president let the French down as well and only replied with vague promises. They only entered war several years later at a more opportune moment for them. The French army lost because of the strategy and decisions of their allies and French Etat-Major, but they had never shown anything but courage on the battlefield, which was not the case of the British. And who else better than the German can judge the reality when they said ‚ÄúThe English will fight until the last French‚Äù? The German lost more tanks against the French in the Battle of Dunkirk in a short time than in the battle of Kursk which is considered the greatest tank battle in history. The British left behind them all their equipment (700 tanks, 45,000 motor vehicles, etc.), and its army was heavily weakened. By saving the British elite soldiers in Dunkirk, the French army allowed the UK to reorganize its army and defend its territory against the Nazi. The British called that ‚ÄúThe Miracle of Dunkirk‚Äù to avoid explaining that they had actually run away and were saved by the French, hiding the truth behind the romantic image that they were saved by 850 Little Boats of British, Dutch and Belgian civilians. Churchill about Dunkirk: ‚ÄúIn wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.‚Äù On June 2000, Prince Charles said: ‚ÄúWithout the success of Operation Dynamo, without the fierce fighting around Dunkirk that held the ring long enough for 240,000 British and 95,000 French servicemen to be taken off the beaches, without the sacrifices made by those who never returned home, D-Day may never have taken place at all‚Äù Former Royal Artilleryman George Kay, 80, said: ‚ÄúSome people say Dunkirk was a defeat, but if all those men like me had not been rescued we could not have gone on to fight and win the war. Without Dunkirk, there would have been no Normandy - the miracle of Dunkirk should therefore be very precious to us all.‚Äù Churchill to Hugh Dalton: ‚ÄúDunkirk was the greatest British military defeat for many centuries.‚Äù In 1944, thanks to the French Resistance who provided all the documents and maps concerning the infrastructures, enemy positions and enemy supply to the Americans, British and Canadians, Operation Overlord could be planned, the famous D-Day. The French Resistance blocked the German army by a series of sabotage actions, destroyed ammunition dumps, fuel depots, phone lines, power plants, roads so that the German couldn‚Äôt reach the beaches to fight against the Allies. These actions were called ""Plans Vert, Rouge, Bleu, Violet, Jaune, Noir and Tortue"". Even General Eisenhower in his memoirs ""Crusade in Europe"", said: ""Throughout France, the Free French had been of inestimable value in the campaign. They were particularly active in Brittany, but on every portion of the front we secured help from them in a multitude of ways. Without their great assistance, the liberation of France and the defeat of the enemy in Western Europe would have consumed a much longer time and meant greater losses to ourselves"", and estimated the value of the Resistance to have been equal to ten to fifteen divisions at the time of the landings"" (One infantry division comprised about ten thousand soldiers) ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Resistance )",2,0,MF,F-eMt3SrfFU,0.06718668949061107,2020-05-19 20:06:02,False,False
