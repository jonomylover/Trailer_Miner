I think this because it seems like this whole AI movement is going to grab the attention people from all over the world and there is one scene where he's running and you see some flags of different counties. So like a UN thing perhaps and he's just a guy on the Australian side trying to regulate AI or just get rid of it for good. Just a theory to put some ease on the matter.

We see it today, masses of people all around the world in protest for their voices to be heard and respected, and those who attempt to control the masses allow the killing of those who refuse to cooperate; such as those citizens in Egypt, who openly protested for change, where many ultimately lost their lives for that change would hopefully at least have meaning. But sadly and in the end, Mubarak; the perpetrating murderer, gets only a slap on the hand.  We see young men being killed by Police; young men I will not judge for their actions, but young men that deserved to be tried in a court of law by a judge and jury; but their lives killed by the hands of the police officer(s) who are protected from prosecution for acting within the departments 'standard procedures.'...where in England, officers exercise great respect and care in apprehending citizen suspects, even at the risk of an officer's life to save a suspect's life to be tried in court.   We see no difference in justice handed out the same way with young, individual whose lives are taken by police officers in a hail of bullets; executed before a judge and jury, lacking any humanity...all in the name of 'Standard Procedure,' or 'Standard or Proper Protocol,' and often lacking the least bit of sensible humanity for the sake and value of life...we even see family pets shot dead by law enforcement officers and treated far worse.  So, there may be a time when robots will be a part of regular human life; where, robots will develop their own personal character and personality, and seem to have consciousness and self-awareness; but their live will be expendable no differently than the lowest of our own humans at the bottom rung of society.  Value of life is only measured by its actions at the time being assessed, by the value of the individual's value toward a system or collection of a whole; as an asset or liability, a benefit or disruption toward the corporation's growth, sustainability, or survival; when it either has no value or it becomes a threat to the corporation's bottom line...the less it is valued, the quicker it becomes out-moded or out-dated, obsolete, retired, terminated, extinguished or executed.",1,0,Hydden N.

2017-10-06T19:58:34,"A great concept for a film and indeed I thought on a personal level that this film was and is one for the history books which I do believe many writers could take a page from.Sure it could have been executed better in different ways but it would have been a different film reaching different types of audiences, where this cut seems to me has been released on a happy medium of sorts.Could have done without Hugh Jackman the bloody peanut farmer but he does work in this with the role he plays as the film has been made for you to think he is infact a peanut farmer,which he is,hahaha.Die Antwoord, word word ya heard,big props and mad respect.Pump up the jam and burn on,not out.I would love to fry on a couple eggs with you chillaz.Peace!",0,0,Dylan Connelly,l6bmTNadhJE,0.16363636363636364,2017-10-06 19:58:34,False,False
