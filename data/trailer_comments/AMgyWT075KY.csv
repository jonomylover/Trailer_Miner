2016-08-22T02:31:24,"Communication ~ something entirely outside our sphere of knowledge when dealing with 'other life', has been egregiously overlooked by the plethora of films collecting proverbial dust on a shelf somewhere in Hollywood, since time immemorial.  This is a first for a film showcasing an effort, if that is a fair assessment, by this film to show the IMMENSE chasm of difference that could present itself! Communication will either end or extend the future of mankind if such a cataclysmic, first-contact event were to happen on Earth.  What many comments [below and surely to follow above] are overlooking is that very few select nations have the technological means to establish 'communication' with alien life from beyond our planet, the top two being the United States* and Russia*.   *In reality the very existence of mankind would rest on those two nations and the decisions they make in such a hypothetical.   Prior to clicking this trailer's video, I was expecting the zingy one-liners with Top Gun style frat-dudes flying ""schnazzy fighter craft"" to fight the aliens, but in reality ""fighting"" might very well be the last thing we humans have (aka no chance in hell) to wage against alien life outside our planet!  We would probably die in a nanosecond if alien life from some distant solar system landed! Think about it = they land here from another system so they theoretically have superior ""technology"" to snuff all of mankind out in a heartbeat!  Or, back to my initial knee-jerk reaction is that I am correct that yes, the final fifteen minutes of this film with have that cool, ""Independence Day-esque"" air battle with a single hero a-la-Will Smith saving the day, followed by that Tom Cruise-esque hero guzzling down a Budweiser to celebrate downing another bogie with his wits and skill in a Bruce Willis-esque ground fight with his trusty Glock and cat-like reflex, all whist driving his trusty Dodge Charger replete with ugly orange paint-job yodeling ""Rebel Yell""!

I  have tried to imagine what that might actually be like if it was to really happen. As I got older I realized that Hollywood or anyone had never done it right. A creature from somewhere else with the ability to arrive here to communicate would be so different that I can't imagine them with heads and arms and talking some gibberish resembling German. This movie is finally touching what it might be like to communicate with such a vastly different being and the disturbances it may bring to humanity as we struggle to reassess our purpose on short notice.

2017-01-17T06:14:15,"Saw this movie just now. It sucks. Plus russia and china are again the bad guys. But the real reason I didn't like it is because it is full of plotholes about reality itself, lacking logic and common sense. Its a total disaster. But people like it because they can't see past nice poetic scenes with slow instrumental crying music. SPOILER ALERT BELOW     SPOILER ALERT        Universal language is not a bunch of symbols. And symbols don't change your way of thinking. The way people think is because of society and culture and whats around them, what rules there are and what it is used to be thought by everyone else is what limits you and molds your thinking. And in each of those cultures they have a different language, but the language itself doesn't change anything. Certainly not give you the power to see the frickin future.  If you didn't have a spoken language you would think anyways, without words, in the form of IDEAS and FEELINGS, and THAT is the universal language. The universal language then would be telephaty, because that would be one of the only ways to communicate your ideas and feelings without using words or symbols. PLOT HOLE. Because we are used to use spoken language we think in words! But EVEN I CAN STOP THINKING IN WORDS AND FEEL THE IDEAS, THE INTENTIONS BEHIND THE WORDS, if I can think without using words anybody can do it too. I must say its quite liberating and makes your mind feel like it expands but it is easier to think in words which I can admit disconnects you a bit from what you really are thinking or feeling ;)   Second. God damn FUTURE. There can be thousands of possibilites and time changes because of us. If time is a circle then when we die we respawn again in the same body in the same year again and again like a friggin videogame. Stupid. In the movie they try to explain the circle of time by TELEPORTING the girl's mind to her future body where she takes the info she needs to make everything happen in the past like she saw, so its a paradox, and paradoxes are that, they don't exist and thats why they're called paradoxes. It means the future exists because in the past somebody changes something using something from the future. How did that something of the future exist in the first place? This has been debated by a lot of people by now and it is the worst way of explaining time so far. ANOTHER PLOT HOLE.  Time should be considered linear, the things you remember is the past, the things to come the future, but you can only exist in the present. Lets say you time travel, your past or future becomes your new present. And shit is intertwined like a damn big ass spiderweb of lines, lines of different pasts and futures, and depending on actions you can take paths through the web to another future and that creates different realities. Another way to consider time is to be just the present, able to travel back or forward in time whatever happened would already have happened meaning that your time travelling didn't change anything but moreso it created that something that the time already had because you were supposed to do it. Meaning if you go back to kill hitler nothing will change, because somehow you already failed. Like that story where they do this and kill a child but the family then adopts another and calls him the same name.  Third. If this was reality those alien ships would have been shot by other alien ships before getting close to earth, because I'm sorry people but earth has been invaded years ago. You think they would invade you like war of the worlds? No, why destroy when you can control. The real intelligent move worthy of an advanced alien race that conquers a planet wouldn't be to push a button and kill everything. The move would be to conquer it by controlling it. Disguise themselves as humans or control a group of humans that hold the power (money and politics) and never show your face. Never ever make humans think they are slaves and slowly put them into a slave system doing what you want them to do by decisions of their own fellow humans. Humans would never suspect anything, and any sighting and attempt to disclose information or create something that would make humans get on the train of advanced technology that would take them away from the path of slavery would be destroyed. Then it may take years, maybe centuries but humanity slowly falls into real slavery until the perfect moment where the aliens would be able to live among us without disguises, using some kind of totalitarian or fascist system.  And in that last paragraph I just described reality. Ring a bell? Globalists? New World order? Nikola Tesla? take a pick.   Even with all of this. The only thing I think it was a nice detail in the movie was the alien ships. They are very spot on to real alien sightings ships and they even got the cloud thing going on like a cloaking device. In real life the sumerians called those cigar shaped ships ""Iniuma"" and were like motherships from where the ""gigirlah"" (flying saucers) came out from. Iniuma as in the movie are big AF, some said to be 500m long (thats 5 blocks), i'm not joking. From the gigirlah come out the little balls of light like cameras or drones of sorts, big as 2 or 3 basketballs.",14,9,Fino Diez,AMgyWT075KY,0.006660248666062621,2017-01-17 06:14:15,False,True

Even cavemen knows to scratch out pictorial drawings as the begining stage of communication..   2) the most glaring plot hole occurs in the most critical part of the movie. How could she have no memory of the phone call she made to the general during the gala meeting if things have already progressed to that stage of celebration of war averted due to that very phone call ?  3) Also if you need to get from point A to point B but to do that you need a piece of info which you can only get if you can see a future where you have reached point B. How could it be possible to do that unless the future managed to happen ahead of the present in the first place ?  Its a logical impossibility ..  Telling me that somehow that is just possible in the movie just seems lazy as an explanation. A story based on manipulation of time logic conveniently leaving the critical missing logic to the imagination of the audience to accept as thats just how it it is an admission that they are unable to resolve that logical flaw by themselves to make the story work. Thats the critical logical flaw there that was not tidied up by the script writers ..  4) is it necessary to portray the Chinese and Russian governments in every movie as unpolished, unfriendly, insensitive, unintelligent people ? Such stereotypical view ..  5) They had to take a leap of faith to leap off the high platform into the alien's tunnel at risk of falling to their death .. so why can't they just ready an inflated air cushion at the bottom in case the gravity change disappears ?  But its still a very good movie in terms of the story and the structure of the movie .. not as good as Contact in terms of being exciting and thought provoking but still good.

2017-05-20T21:32:54,"This is my review of the movie Arrival: (2/5 stars) There are spoilers ahead.  I went into Arrival knowing nothing about the plot. As someone who is immensely interested in linguistics and languages, I was delighted to see that topic explored with an attention to detail and accuracy I hadn't seen in a movie before. Arrival was shaping up to be for linguistics what Breaking Bad was to Chemistry, The Expanse to living in space, and Gravity to orbital mechanics. An honest and realistic confrontation with a discipline of science incorporated into a gripping story.  Unfortunately that lasts up to about the halfway mark when the alien language is completely deciphered and Amy Adams can now talk to the newcomers. From then on, the story devolves into utter nonsense. The language turns out to be a time machine that allows Amy Adams to see her own future and set up a bootstrap paradox with her past self to save the world from a pending world war. And the only reason the aliens came to earth is because they wanted to teach all humanity the language because they will need the help of humanity for some never-explained MacGuffin problem 3000 years in the future. And the cherry on top is that the entire language-is-a-time-machine idea is based on a long-debunked hypothesis in linguistics that no-one takes seriously nowadays.  The movie turns from an interesting and honest take on language, translation and linguistics into a completely nonsensical farce with physics defying superpowers that are there only to serve a never explained MacGuffin. It's shameful and quite disappointing that so many people seem to enjoy a story this stupid but I'm not surprised as we saw the same with Interstellar. It, too, had a brilliant portrayal of concepts like global warming, wormholes, black holes, time dilation and more but then devolved into ""there's a time machine in the black hole designed to allow Matthew Mcconaughey to set up a bootstrap paradox to save humanity from certain extinction"". This sorry excuse for the conclusion of a story is in both movies accompanied by deliberate mysticism and vagueness that is designed to confuse the viewer and ascribe a deeper meaning to it than there actually is. The only meaning is this: The writer had a writer's block and inserted a time machine because there was a fucking deadline.  Rant over.  Jeremy Renner was forgettable (I still love him though). The score was boring. The visuals were okay but the color palette bland and uninteresting.

People need to learn to just enjoy sci-fi movies without getting a validation.
