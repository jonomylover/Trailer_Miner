2018-03-30T12:28:01,"This dishonest depiction of Atheists is based on what Christians are told Atheists are like. They get told other lies in order to instill a sense of fear, so that they won't have conversations with them, or even treat them as human, out of fear that they'll de-convert. This is a pointless fear to be sold, for logic and discussion did not ever get anyone involved in Christianity, so it poses no risk in getting them out of it.  Beyond this dishonesty, there is another dishonesty in the very premise of the movie itself. This is the flawed idea that an Atheist will convert to Christianity once something horrible happens to them. In all fairness, if someone were raised to be religious, slowly fell out of it, and THEN thought that MAYBE they were an Atheist [but were mistaken], this would then be an option, because they would be falling back on something.  Every Atheist has their own story. For me, I was NEVER indoctrinated as a child. As a result, I am lacking in the FEAR, the GUILT, and the MISPLACED TRUST in what my parents would say. These elements are ESSENTIAL for someone to believe in god. I've yet to meet a Christian who goes to church because they ""love Jesus."" It's always about FEAR. It's fear of satan and hell, and all about repenting and getting saved.  Because I am personally lacking in the elements required to believe, it is actually IMPOSSIBLE for me to become a Christian. This is because, for me, holding this belief has no value. It makes no sense. It's superstition, to me.  Since Christians have those immovable elements in their minds, thanks to childhood indoctrination, it is IMPOSSIBLE for them to NOT believe. They have no choice, and I have no choice as well. For even when someone was indoctrinated, and they fall out of their religious beliefs, they WILL fall back into it, either when they get older or when something bad happens. It's a case of returning to what one knows in an effort to bring comfort to themselves during a time when chaos seems to be the order of the day.  The most insulting part of the idea that an Atheist will convert when something bad happens, is that bad things have already happened in my life. Horrible, horrific things. Not once did I ever call upon a god of ANY kind, regardless of whether or not this god was commercially-available for purchase. Never, not because I'm somehow smarter than anyone else, because intelligence has nothing to do with it.  The part that SHOULD insult Christians the most is the LIES that this movie tells. I've noted the two big ones. I am familiar with Christian Mythology, and your god Yahweh had a TOP TEN list of ""commandments."" One of them was that it is a sin to ""bear false witness."" This means that it is wrong to lie. And yet, there are lies here that are being told in the name of the god who commanded that these lies not be told. This is a typical American Christian move, with the idea that if a lie saves a soul, then it is worth it.  This is how Donald Trump got elected by Christians. The bar is so low, that all one has to do is declare themselves to be a Christian, and that's it. No bible reading, no personal growth, no accountability, nothing. ""TWO Corinthians?"" REALLY? That's your representative?  This is but one of MANY reasons why Christians and Christianity cannot be taken seriously. Grown adults should know better. But that's the power of ""childhood indoctrination,"" a nice way of speaking of ""brainwashing children."" It should be illegal. I know that Christians can't help it, because their brainwashing is powerful, but that does not remove my disappointment in you. The time has come to put away superstitious mythologies, and face life like a grown up.",7,0,DrumWild,PnTc2p2w2X8,-0.0938271604938272,2018-03-30 12:28:01,False,False

2020-05-15T21:27:21,I don't like how this movie end at all. If this was a real life movie I'm not sure if the guy would have ever turn to christ. First his son then his wife die. What remorse or compassion does God have for this guy in this movies. The makers who made this film need to rethink about what they portrait in this movie. A man who son die then loose his faith. Find it again then suddenly take his wife. I don't think this is the way God's work. Shame on you producers.,1,0,niah Alvarado,PnTc2p2w2X8,0.024615384615384615,2020-05-15 21:27:21,False,False
