For instance in this trailer, the information on the virus was completely unnecessary. Knowing it now, and seeing the rest to follow, I probably won't even want to see this film now....simply because the stupid trailer ruined a huge plot focus/twist, and possibly something crucial that would have caught me off guard.

The Bible never gave a timeline to the creation of universe. The very first verse says....""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"". The account of the creation of living beings is of 6 days. Only a fool will get the simple words wrong or intentionally twist them for self gain and fame. But the even bigger liar was that minister who didn't answer his question (if Dan is telling the truth in which case he is brainless).  ""I was raised Episcopalian, and I was very religious as a kid. Then, in eighth or ninth grade, I studied astronomy, cosmology, and the origins of the universe. I remember saying to a minister, 'I don't get it. I read a book that said there was an explosion known as the Big Bang, but here it says God created heaven and Earth and the animals in seven days. Which is right?' Unfortunately, the response I got was, 'Nice boys don't ask that question.' A light went off, and I said, 'The Bible doesn't make sense. Science makes much more sense to me.'
