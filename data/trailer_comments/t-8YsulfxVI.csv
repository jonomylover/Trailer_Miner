[Al-Qur’an 10:92]  Now, the shocking piece of information is this: The body of the Pharaoh was discovered in 1898 in the Red Sea at the place called jabalian, so, prophet Mohammed couldn't have known that Pharaoh's body will be displayed, cause it has been discovered over a 1000 years after prophet Mohammed's time.  Now, the body of Pharaoh is in a museum in Egypt. So, who told prophet Mohammed this prophecy? the only logical answer is God, the same God who sent Moses, Jesus, Noah..etc.   Pharoah's body is in a museum in Egypt, it remains as a sign to mankind.

Ask any christian or muslim if they believe in the divinity of the Old Testament and they will admit, yes. So Moses was the same for all three religions, although of course, Judaism is the only legitimate religion. Everything that follows was created by one man which can never be proven for obvious reasons and is bologna.   Second, although all sacred texts in the Old Testament mentioned only the name Pharaoh, there is obviously a name associated with each pharaoh. However, the Torah does not explicitly mention which pharaoh it was during the exodus. There were scientific studies done by archeologists and they linked Moses' time to the Pharaoh Ramses. I believe the city of Ramses was mentioned in the Old  Testament, so this is a valid claim that Ramses was the ruler.  I appreciate this movie and i hope that the biblical accounts are accurate. So far, it looks great.   And to your question, ""Triple Double homicide,"" the reason the Jews did not build pyramids for King Solomon was because there was no reason to. G-d himself did not dictate to the Jewish people to build those pyramids. Egyptian rulers forced them to build them to so they can bury idols and other mummies. King Solomon was directed by G-d himself on how to build the holy temple. The Jews had no interest in building any other idolatrous pyramid.

I don't understand what the point of arguing with non believers is. it's god's responsibility to show non believers the path to salvation. not yours or any other Christians responsibility. god gave us free will to choose right? then why are you using your free will to bash people that don't believe the same thing you believe. and i'm not trying to be mean to you. you didn't say anything hurtful to me and you seem respectful when people aren't just insulting your beliefs and calling it an argument. I just don't understand your need to push your beliefs on other people or why you feel it is your responsibility to refute any atheist questions and why you spend so much time on the comment boards telling people they are wrong and you can prove why they are wrong. when i'm sorry but until god comes down and proves you right. you still only have faith. and faith isn't enough for you to say you are right and someone else is wrong.,0,0,Joe Aaroen,t-8YsulfxVI,-0.006487168987168995,2014-10-04 07:54:42,True,True

DNA Proof that cannot be disputed.  http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002397  The indigenous North African ancestry may have been more common in Berber populations and appears most closely related to populations outside of Africa, but divergence between Maghrebi peoples and Near Eastern/Europeans likely precedes the Holocene (>12,000 ya). We also find significant signatures of sub-Saharan African ancestry that vary substantially among populations. These sub-Saharan ancestries appear to be a recent introduction into North African populations, dating to about 1,200 years ago in southern Morocco and about 750 years ago into Egypt, possibly reflecting the patterns of the trans-Saharan slave trade that occurred during this period.

It is also a shame that the African actors in this are playing extras, that is disgraceful. This plus the upcoming ""God of Egypt"" are going to flop at the Box Office. Having Caucasian actors playing the roles of great African and Semetic figures is utterly ridiculous! I will say this much for the film though, the production, some of the cast apart from the main roles and costumes are accurate.

And Moses chose to do God's will despite having a speech impediment. (Exodus 6:12,13) Jehovah's will had three purposes.   1. Free the Hebrews from 400 years of slavery (Exodus 2:23-25) and repay back wages (Exodus 12:36)  2. Humiliate the mighty Egyptian culture, Pharaoh himself, and expose the Egyptian gods as powerless and fake. As Jehovah so powerfully put it, ""For I will pass through the land of Egypt on this night and strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and I will execute judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am Jehovah."" (Exodus 12:12)   3. Warn other nations that the living God, Jehovah, fights for his ancient people (Exodus 14:21-25)  Like Moses and Noah today Jehovah is using humans to warn people about the coming end of this wicked system of things. (Matthew 24:14) Jesus called what will soon happen a ""great tribulation"". At Matthew 24:21, 22 Jesus states, ""there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again."" Compared to the ten plagues on Egypt the great tribulation is going to be worse because what will happen will happen on a grand scale on the entire planet. But after this event happens this system will end. In its place will be a new system that will richly bless all humans and bring humans back to perfection.

2014-10-11T03:27:46,"Movies are for entertainment. The bible makes for good entertainment as the older mythologies did. A god is not in control - there is no proof - only the ramblings of people who claim to have faith. Those who have faith and who preach zealously are most often those who are hiding the most ""sin"". Legions of priests of the ""original church"" who molest young children. Pastors of ""new churches"" who break the commandments and commit crimes daily. Wars that are started in the names of these ""gods"". The bible that christians and muslims speak about has been found to have many inconsistencies. It's been widely accepted now that a three person dynasty of roman emperors founded Christianity to deify themselves and to reign in the protests and opposition that plagued the flailing roman empire.   When it comes to this period. There are biological and scientific reasons why each ""plague"" happened. Religion and monotheism is why we have such wars today. Think about it. The bible claims to have a merciful god. Is this what is happening today. NO matter how much people pray and sacrifice the world is still burning. But those same people only pray and do not act to end the suffering. Choices can be made and it's not in the hands of a god it's in the hands of human beings who populate this earth. Don't tell me what is happening is ""god's will"" and that I should have faith that all will go according to plan. I've seen too much war and suffering at the hands of ""holy churches"" to even remotely entertain the idea. ",0,0,avnas001,t-8YsulfxVI,0.16200159489633173,2014-10-11 03:27:46,True,True

2014-10-26T23:53:10,"People say that those with religious beliefs are ignorant and stupid, believing in mythical stories and such. Yet, these are the same people that believe that the science and laws that work on this Earth, are universal. It is absolute ignorance and arrogance that you could believe that the laws created and discovered by man here, will apply on the opposite side of this universe/galaxy, or wherever. Notice how the Big Bang theory still has the word 'theory' in it, meaning that if you choose to believe in the big bang, you would have to put your faith into it. Yes, there's scientific evidence that COULD lead to it being true, but at the end of the day, it is faith that you believe in a theory. And once more, there are those who end up living without arms and legs, and other problems, and they chose to believe in a God, that allowed them to keep on living and not giving up. You can argue that it was themselves, but actually, it was their FAITH in something that allowed them to wake up every morning and not be put down. There is nothing wrong with having faith in something if it brings nothing but positivity in your life, so why bash on it? There are plenty of Christians who are scientists, doctors, CEOs and that are smart, as there are plenty of Athiests/Agnostics/etc. that are the above as well. So to say Christians are 'retarded' and such, only shows the ignorance and lack of acceptance on your part. It's funny because atheists complain about Christians shoving down religion down their throats, when in reality, atheists are usually the first to start hating. Not all of course. Basing your prejudice thoughts due to right-wingers like Jehovah's Witness types, is like saying all middle-eastern people are terrorists, which sadly, a lot of Americans still choose to believe.

Associating it to Christian dogma, western society is CULTURAL APPROPRIATION.  Second, the movie has a butch of historical inaccuracies: 1. Plate-armors did not exist in Egypt in the time of Ramesses II. 2. The trailer says that there are ""400 thousand slaves"". The bible says there were 600,000 Israelite MEN. If we add the women, it makes around 1.2 million. If we add at least 1 child per-family, it's almost 2 million people. Out of the around 2.5 million population of Egypt at the time, it's morbidly illogical to assume it happened, but let's not get into it. 3. The banners depicted in the trailer, as Egyptian flags of some sort - did not exist. Vexillology and banners appeared only during Roman times, when the Legions of Rome had their own banners - that's around 400 years after the time of Ramesses. 4.

In the very least, it would appear that the atheist, railing against the claims of Christianity, or the agnostic or whomever, is shaken somewhere in the  core of his being so that he must feel the need to respond. In short, it is interesting that throughout history, ""God"" has produced such an effect on man, has evoked such a response. In terms of personal belief: if Jesus was not who he claimed to be and Christians believed in a great lie that taught salvation and goodness and love to all men, then they lose nothing. If Jesus was who he said he was (the Son of God) and people believe him…then they gain everything and still lose nothing. If Jesus was who he said he was and a man chooses not to believe him, then that man gains nothing and loses everything. Furthermore, Jesus could only be one of three things: Lord, Liar, or Lunatic. He was not just a good moral teacher…he claimed to be God. No other option. If he was deliberately deceiving his followers by saying he was God, then he was a liar…but this negates his teachings about honesty. A hypocrite. But this goes counter to the effect his teachings have had on humanity in general (true, some have twisted his words for personal gain, violence, etc. That is a horrible travesty.) In general, however, people have been changed for the good. Jesus preached about moral purity, dignity, displayed through his life's work. Historian Philip Schaff gives this argument: ""How, in the name of logic, common sense, and experience, could an imposter have invented, and consistently maintained from beginning to end, the purest and noblest character known in history with the most perfect air of truth and reality. How could he have conceived and successfully carried out a plan of unparalleled beneficence, moral magnitude, and sublimity, and sacrificed his own life for it, in the face of the strongest prejudices of his people and age?"" He could not have been a liar and convinced people to believe in that lie for thousands of years…the lie would have imploded by now. Now, it is possible that he was a lunatic. A crazy man who convinced himself of his divinity and started proclaiming that divinity with full conviction to the people of Israel. Jesus believing himself to be God sounds like a person today, myself for example, believe myself to be JFK in the flesh, or Elvis, or an alien from Mars. I would be deluded and possibly even locked up so I would be a menace to anyone else as I wander North America touting my beliefs. However, let's say Jesus was schizo…A schizophrenic person typically desires to escape the world of reality…Claiming to be God would definitely be a retreat from reality. But in light of all we know (granted we actually read the Biblical account, historical texts supporting his life, etc.) about Jesus, it's hard to fathom he was mentally deranged. He spoke some of the most incredibly profound things ever said. ""Do unto others as you would have them do to you."" (The Golden Rule, just to mention one.) When you consider the depth and skillfulness of Jesus' teachings, they smack of total mental soundness. His Sermon on the Mount has more practical psychology in it than the writings of Freud, Jung, and others put together…Regardless of whether you believe his claims to be God, if you but read his teachings, they are the perfect blueprint for a successful life and true contentment. My question, objectively, remains: ""how could a complete lunatic maintain perfect clarity and possess such a razor-sharp intellect as the teachings of Jesus seem to suggest?"" True, a schizophrenic man may possess unsurpassed musical genius or even mental genius (The Soloist, excellent movie and story)…but I have yet to hear of a schizophrenic or any other person that we label ""handicapped"" uttering words that have changed lives and nations. It is difficult for us to dismiss Jesus as an utter lunatic with delusions of grandeur. I must personally conclude that He was who he actually claimed to be. Jesus Christ, Son of God. Now, we could ask ourselves all these questions: Lunatic? Liar? Lord? and say ""No!"" to all three. That is a choice that one must live with. The evidence, logically speaking, points to the validity of his claims. The question is not: possible? It's what is probable? We can't bench the Jesus question. There has to be a choice, and there has to be a living with the consequences of that choice. Seems like most Christians (look at the middle east) are choosing ""Lord,"" and living with great suffering…But you never hear of them renouncing that belief (unless they were never serious about it in the first place.) Christians in America get labelled ""intolerant""…but before we can call them such, mustn't we ask ourselves: ""By calling a Christian intolerant, am I not being intolerant myself?"" Two-way street. Who you decide Jesus is and was must be your choice. Granted, the evidence seems to support the validity of his claims, but one might choose to deny that because of the significant moral implications a belief in him would have. So, I guess I encourage all people: Christians, atheists, moralists, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, etc. to continue to seek out truth wherever it may be found. Though I may say ""Jesus"", continue seeking for yourself. I encourage Christians not to respond with rage when an atheist brings up a good point. Similarly I encourage atheists not to respond with disgust and intolerance when a Christian (informed or otherwise) states their belief. Ultimately all of us have faith: the atheist that there is no God, the Christian that there is a God.",0,1,Blake Anderson,t-8YsulfxVI,0.1533467160080063,2014-11-02 02:47:18,True,True

2014-11-07T09:26:18,"Judging from the trailer, I don't think there's going to be a lot of ""I was once his brother"" moments, which kind of ruins the whole thing for me. It kind of sets it up too much so that there's ONE central ""bad guy"" and ONE central ""good guy.""  I don't like that.  I want to see Moses, devastated on the inside, because he's essentially ruining his brother's life. The same brother he grew up and played with. I want to see Ramses, torturing himself over the decision to slay his own brother or defend his own people. I think The Prince of Egypt portrayed that very well, and that was a pretty good movie.  But then again, the director DOES have a right to make the movie how he sees fit. If Ridley Scott wanted to direct this movie a certain way, then it's absolutely possible that he could make a good film regardless of the direction he takes it in.   So I'm not saying this is going to be a BAD movie. It's got Ridley Scott and Christian Bale and Sigourney Weaver, so it's got a lot of star power, but at the same time, they're adapting a Bible story, which is traditionally a very violent and explicit story, and making it PG-13, and I don't know if that's the right direction to be taking.  But that feels unfair. I think the only way to see how this turns out is by waiting and watching it just like everyone else. ",1,0,Paul Lee,t-8YsulfxVI,0.12364532019704436,2014-11-07 09:26:18,True,True

I don't know why white people (like you) always come around trying to convincing black people that we never lived in Egypt in ancient times. Don't forget but Egypt is in Africa. Oh and back when Egypt was called Kemet, Asiatics were referred to black people not yellow people. Black people all across the world was referred to as Asiatics. Africa was called east Asia, Europe was called Eurasia, every continent was called Asia until the European came and changed the name.

Here's another book called MESSAGE TO THE BLACK MAN and the honorable Elijah Muhammad said: ""We, the tribe of Shabazz, says Allah (God), were the FIRST to discover the best part of the earth of our planet to live on. The rich Nile valley of Egypt and the present seat of the holy city Mecca, Arabia."" I bet you no nothing about all the black gods in Egypt, what about ""Atum the black creator God of kemet?"" Are white white so hateful to black that you would lie on obvious history. Are white people angry at the fact that my ancestors built the pyramids? White people will even say aliens built the pyramids before they give us credit. That's the mentality of the old slave masters, they put black people at the bottom every time. Sorry but your sarcastic anti black historical jokes don't work on me. Read a book called ""EGYPTIAN SACRED SCIENCE AND ISLAM"" and that book will intellectually smash all your little false white and Arab history over there. I guess the so called ""white Egyptians"" or Arabs painted their pictures on ancient walls in Egypt look like black people.

The Dutch anatomist Lode Wijk ""Louis"" Bolk wrote in origin of racial characteristics in Man, ""White skin started from an ancestor with black skin, in whose offspring hair and skin color was suppressed more and more (grafting).""  The English physician James Cowles Prichard likewise concluded that the physical differences between the races of man could ONLY have resulted from a method comparable to ""process of artificial selection carried on by plant and animal breeders."" He said, ""probable that the fairest races of white people of Europe, are descended from.. Negroes.""

The ancient Egyptians referred to the devil or Satan under various names. The three most common of these names were: Seth, Typhon and Apopis. It is also a fact that throughout the writings of ancient Egypt the Caucasian people are referred to as the ""Typhonians"" or the ""People of Seth."" When Diodorus spoke of a group of ""foreigners"" who had been driven out of Egypt, he described them as ""men the color of Typhon"". Similar language can be found in the writings of Manetho, the Egyptian priest, who on many occasions referred to the whites as ""Typhonians"". In English, such names mean ""the devils"". So the earliest evidence suggest that the ancient Egyptians viewed the Caucasian people as a race of devils.  In As much evidence from Egypt clearly shows that the term devil was once just another name for white people. Typhonians was referred to people with a white pinkish, or reddish skin tone. Typhonians are considered devils in ancient Egyptian history.  Let's not forget that ancient Egypt wasn't always called Egypt. Actually it was called kemet, the term kemet itself means BLACK. Europeans renamed It Egypt a few centuries back which is a Greek name. The term kemet means BLACK, kemet is in Africa!

2014-11-27T08:57:10,"""Let them fight"" -Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, Godzilla (2014). I knew the battle of the comments section here will be more exciting than the trailers and you guys didn't fail me.  On a more serious note, I always wonder why will there be a heated debate over this kind of things. I understand that the christians might feel compelled to believe and even provide evidence and arguments for the reality of this seemingly impossible and scientifically uncomfortable event. But why do the atheist care? why would they feel threaten at all? I don't see them being so active in the comments section of ""Hercules"". I for one wouldn't waste my time debating with someone about whether the ""clash of titans"", ""journey to the west"" and ""cinderella"" did actually occur. I would not feel at all compelled to comment that those events did not occur. If atheist consider bible stories as fairytales, why then do they feel compelled to commend that exodus is fictional while they do not seem so interested to commend that cinderella is fictional?  Is it because subconciously regardless of what they claim to believe in, they actually classify bible stories diferently from fairy tales and they feel threaten by the possibility of them being wrong? Or is it because its fun to watch someone struggle to defend their faith? Or maybe they feel compelled to enlighten the religious people to the truth. But if they are truely an atheist, why bother? Life is but a matter of random chance of atoms and chemicals bombarding each other, with no purpose or meaning. The religious peopole can go on being ""unenlighten"", it is not like it matters. In the end atheist or not we will end up being in the same carbon cycle (i'm speaking from atheist point of view). Well perhaps some atheist find meaning in winning in arguments, it gives them some sense of purpose. Well maybe the reason isn't so complicated. All this is just for the sake of entertainment. If that's the reason, I can understand, I find reading the comments rather entertaining too.   I can only guess their motives, but i'll be glad if the community here can enlighten me with regards to my question of why do atheists feel the need to debate about this movie?   ",0,2,Tuck Hing Lau,t-8YsulfxVI,0.012202380952380949,2014-11-27 08:57:10,True,True

But the ancient Egyptians did make a distinction between themselves and the people who lived further south, in what was called Nubia. It is now Sudan. You can see this distinction in their tomb paintings and other historical records. There are actually more pyramids in Nubia than there are in Egypt, and the Nubians built quite a civilization of their own, albeit one heavily influenced by the culture of ancient Egypt. At one point in history, Nubia actually conquered Egypt and a number of black pharaohs reigned, including one named Taharqa, whose pylon can still be seen in the ruins of ancient Thebes. But all you have to do is look at the historical record to SEE that while there were certainly black men and women living in ancient Egypt, all the ancient Egyptians weren't black. There are mummies with blond wavy hair still attached to their heads. Take a look at the mummy of Rameses II, the pharaoh depicted in ""Gods and Kings,"" which is on display at the Cairo Museum. One look and you can see he wasn't black! If you want to get all upset over historical inaccuracies, an Egyptian prince such as Moses would not have worn a goatee as Bale does in the early scenes of the film.

Let's face it the English European Whites weren't there.  Even Greeks weren't there.  And although you may hate it even the Arabians were not there in the bountiful numbers they are today. For those of you who say blacks should not be in fairy tales made from Europe, I say Whites should not be in nonfiction epics based in Africa.  And before the storm of idiot replies I expect to receive telling me that Egypt wasn't Black let me quote past Greek historians who were in Egypt after the year BC.  ""Herodotus states in a few passages that the Egyptians were black/dark. According to most translations, Herodotus states that a Greek oracle was known to be from Egypt because she was ""black"", that the natives of the Nile region are ""black with heat"", and that Egyptians were ""black skinned with woolly hair"". Lucian observes an Egyptian boy and notices that he is not merely black, but has thick lips. Diodorus Siculus mentioned that the Aethiopians considered the Egyptians a colony. Appollodorus, a Greek, calls Egypt the country of the black footed ones.""

It was just a burning bush in the background and the kid was God and the kid was talking to Moses, The burning bush had no significance in that scene at all, it was just chilling in the background burning and thats it. It was the Kid who was playing God that was talking. And the conversation was not at all like the one out of the bible. Moses was suppose to come across as a guy who was lacking confidence and was unsure of him self.   The parting of the Red Sea was horrible... There is actually not at all a parting of the red sea, its just a tsunami that closes the sea back up. Also The move felt more about Moses and Pharaoh, When actually the story is about God saving his people and simply just using moses for that. That was the big main theme in the book, but instead this movie it seems to be more about just Moses and Pharaohs little rivalry.  Great special effects but man... there was nothing powerful in this movie at all.

This all stems from the unfortunate idea that all black people look the same. Yes, Egyptians now definitely look more caucasian due to migration and changes over time. But there's no denying Ancient Egyptians had a large variety of appearances. They weren't all black. but they also weren't all olive skinned. You can see this in their own artwork and in writings. Nubians are a group of people in ancient egypt that are often depicted and they are consistently described as being extremely dark in complexion. Ancient Egypt spanned over many generations and their artwork depicts them as looking more black or more semitic closer to the first century and depending on the dynasty of the time. But there's no mistaking that none of them were European looking in the slightest. Even Cleopatra, while not black was Greek of the ptolemy group. Greeks were also not white by todays standards. Greeks admired blond hair and blue eyes which were rare features among their people and they depicted their gods as having these features, but they actually didn't look like that and any historian will tell you that. All reconstructions and sculptures of Nefertiti show her to look what like what would considered to be black in America today. I would compare her features to somalians or the model Iman, definitely not a European looking woman in the slightest. The truth is that middle eastern/egyptian people love to seperate themselves from blacks but there's a very fine line between the races in some regions and at the end of the day they weren't treated much better by Europeans. You are all inhabitants of the same continent and the truth is that some mixing happened over time because intersectionality often exists in race. You can be white hispanic, or black hispanic but if you're light skinned and you're from mexico it doesn't make you european. We see this intersectionality a lot in places like Brazil and the West Indies, where we have people who look Indian but are very much mixed with blacks and the West Africans slaves that were bought over by colonizers at the time. Even if we keep all the race things aside, this movie is still a mess since it's a biblical story. Moses's wife was described in the Bible as being a very dark woman, so much so that Miriam did not like her. For that God cursed her with leprosy and Moses had to pray for her forgiveness. So, it's not only historically innacurate but it also whitewashes the story it's based on. I mean honestly, Christian Bale as Moses? He's English. He does not have origins anywhere near Africa and he is not olive in complexion in the slightest. Same goes for pretty much for the rest of this cast. It's entirely made up of british and european people. You wouldn't make a movie about medieval europe with an all middle eastern cast so why would you do this with a movie about Ancient Egypt and the hebrew population. See Prince of Egypt for a better depiction. That film shows the range of black and browm people that would have been a more accurate depiction.",31,19,Glisean,t-8YsulfxVI,0.09537561576354679,2014-12-07 19:25:55,False,True

2014-12-10T02:47:06,"Remember this: Moses fled was a murderer and he had to flee Egypt as a young man. He hid by the ""Sea of Reeds"" and follower the Mediterranean coastline until safe from the Egyptians. He then crossed over to Midian and married a Midianite woman named Ziphorrah, had at least two sons from her. When the older Moses went back to free his people in the Exodus, he remembered this ""Sea of Reeds"" and made a bee line for this place, knowing he could hide thousands of people in the tall swamp grass is the Egyptians decided to chase them. They camped there, with the Mediterranean on one side and the brackish swamp full of tall cattails on the other. (Note that the stop after leaving Egypt are all  LISTED in Numbers 33, and this shows where they camped JUST BEFORE LEAVING the swampy sea full of reeds. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED: a strong East wind blew the water out of the bay, so that the Israelites could cross the narrow inlet without getting their knees wet. Suddenly the tide returned and the wind stopped, so the ocean came back and caught the Egyptians, just as they were trying to cross. So it was the REED SEA they crossed, not the RED SEA. But that didn't make a good bedtime story for children, and it was more glorious to say it was the Red Sea (150 miles to the south--a five day walk with women and animals), And so it says the RED SEA in the Bible.

So Moses son was half white and black.  Ancient Egypt was invaded and occupied many time by European, Alexander, and Cleopatra was a Greek descendant. Muslims actually wanted to hide the fact of their African ancestry defaced many ancient Egypt status including the Sphinx, and later blame on Napoleon's own racism.

Again another daytime parting of the Red Sea when scripture says they followed a bright funnel cloud out of Egypt to the Sea, and then at sunset the dark black cloud followed behind them thru the sea all night long. With the Egyptians not seeing where they were going because the light of the cloud and the full moon only lit forward in the direction of Israel, and not backward to the Egyptians west of the funnel cloud. This effect could have been awesome in theatres showing the comet approach Earth, split in two, strike Earth, erupt Thera Atlantis and sink it, (few realize the plagues already starting before Moses predicted 10 of them). The half of the comet took orbit, and came thru Egypt killing the firstborn with ammonia (quite different than the cyanide that killed 185,000 Assyrians when the bright comet made shadows going back 10 steps). Then as this comet created this funnel cloud still outside Memphis, and they follow it to the Sea, it makes a U-turn freaking them out as to why would they follow it to go back. But they do until they're trapped. Moses already sees the sea will part, so he strikes it. Both nations are in a vortex where the highest winds are throw against walls of water as the ammonia chills it and lifts it upward. this parting is about a half-mile wide. They cross in 12 hours. And the Psalms of Moses says Pharaoh drowned with is armies. Naturally with sunrise the whole effect goes null and the ground goes from dry chill to mud. Israel runs to escape. Now wouldn't you have liked my 3D explanation. This comet orbited 40 years, no idea if it then struck or broke free. Odds are orbit decay and strike.

2014-12-22T22:34:19,"I really admire those in this comment section who do the diligence but are also respectful in sharing their viewpoints on a profound topic. I am a believer in God, this only means something when I also value intelligence (a healthy dose of open-mindedness seems crucial) and love better known as harmony across the planet. If (G)od were to actually arbitrate powers as proof, (like showing answers to a test), what would be the obvious implications. Where would humans' interests for research or imagination as necessary forms for ambition and desire to reach our fullest potentials go? Better yet, how are we to truly learn anything of a divine worth if god always intervened directly with our living experiences? I think that this would be as trivial as the movie on a larger scale. At worse, what do you think the human condition would be like if we were in the presence of something unbelievable? We'd all likely become schizophrenics if most of us haven't become absolutely psychotic already because of the extreme makeup of a rationalist society today. Irrationality doesn't make something fictional or fantasy, that's art which is the closest universal language for speaking to one's soul, spirit, or state of impressionism. Irrationality is merely a word charged as being something negative. But I would argue that irrationality is supreme quality of reasoning to an otherwise universe of contradictory truths, unpredictability, and surprises.   By the way, freedom at a absolute level of its implication would seem to leave us totally in the dark to ignorance (uncertainties) until we began to collectively yet freely coexist in a loving planetary playground filled with sharing each others' opinions/ experience. I would argue that like the apparent subtle impossible possibility of the Big Bang notion, one seemingly improbable potentially significant mere human being on this planet today has what it takes to change reality by simply being real with themselves and then sharing that to open-minded yet critically curious individuals.   For faithful peeps, I'd kindly encourage to consider the idea that we are not perfect but perfect just as we are. This should hopefully remind some of us to be patient with those who sincerely hold true to their orientations to what's true as much as we do in our faiths.     For those not so easily swayed, a friendly quote to spark healthier consideration about anomalies, uncertainties, or questions not yet solved (mysteries). ""Coincidences are god's way of remaining anonymous"" Albert Einstein. if (G)od were to show its complete presence, we would in all likelihood not be conscious in the common sense of the word I suspect. Perhaps atheism is sort of like an extremely narrow outlook onto facts as vast as most of the size of the universe. My premise for a rhetorical argument is that how does one maintain a convincing idea that we are the only ones in the universe? Whether we are or not, I'm sure just the basis of the question raises profound implications for seriously intriguing general public discussion.",0,0,Robert Cochran,t-8YsulfxVI,0.10269230769230767,2014-12-22 22:34:19,False,True

This old testament story is about God's deliverance of His people.

Although the story is still vague and mysterious to archeologists and historians it is a great material for a movie. The portrayal of characters and brotherly love that turns into a deadly duel is staggering in this story. Moses got a more humane touch here. Most people imagine him as a ruthless avenger and a barbaric brute. The Ramses character is of the greatest interest to me. He seems quite sane and likeable as an unexperienced young leader only to lose his mind and turn into a dictator when he loses his grasp over the empire.

What is really missing from this movie is the reverent relationship between God and Moses. God cannot work through someone who is arrogant, worldly and angry as this Hollywood character is portrayed.

2015-03-16T20:36:44," All of this black Egypt vs white Egypt bs comes from two things.1 , the fact that black American slaves culture was eradicated. They were forbidden speak native languages, They were forbidden to uphold customs, They were forbidden to learn to read, They were forbidden to learn to write, They were forbidden to learn mathematics, They were forbidden to learn science.      The real sin wasn't slavery,yes slavery was horrible, but slavery existed all over the world thousands of years prior to that and even existed within Africa itself. The real sin was the destruction of one's IDENTITY.    American intellectuals in the teens and twentys, foresaw that sooner or later blacks were going to integrate with whites. They immediately assumed that blacks were going to readopt old cultures that they had in Africa which they did not consider compatible with the European model. They begin to take measures, which minimized the chances of blacks pursuing their own culture, they did this by forcing  unwilling whites to integrate with blacks ARTISTICALLY, this was the  last way blacks identified themselves, through their art, every other form of identification was destroyed. You see, everything from cutting grass to picking fruit can be art. So they wanted to destroy the last way blacks identified themselves. Instead something wonderful happened, an entirely new  American compatible white/black culture was created with jazz music being the glue to that new culture. The New culture expanded further and became what it is today. Some segment of blacks who are unsatisfied with black American cultures still search elsewhere for their identity, which ancient Egypt is considered to be one of the most focused targets of  their admiration.   Ok so blacks, but what about whites.  This goes back to the slavery days also. These are two streams running from the same river. It was declared and accepted that blacks were only three fifths of a man, this allowed people to feel justified in treating them with horrible  disregard to human life. Especially cultural eradication. This was done with the expectation that if they  see themselves as subhuman, they'll behave as subhuman. So a perpetuation of denial was put in place to keep slaves chained MENTALLY. Around the same time that blacks obtained civil rights, many whites discontinued this practice of mental degradation towards blacks and many accepted blacks and interacted socially.  A few  whites who didn't feel that blacks were normal humans, didn't understand that mental degradation was only done to convince blacks that blacks were inhuman, not whites that black  ARE inhuman . Growing up a parallel life with blacks ,and seeing them accept their position as less  human, many whites believed this and accepted it as a truth. They then taught their children and their grandchildren also followed. Now there are those that persist in denying black achievement, whether it were actual black achievement or not. As soon as they get word that blacks achieved something they will come to disprove that it is possible that they can achieve anything because they are just subhuman.  They believe this so fiercely that they will even convince other people who don't believe this to be true.    So blacks, you can't change the past and you don't know which language your ancestors spake, if it is your position that whites share no cultural similarities with ancient Egypt. then you must realize that is also true in the case with you, since your culture was eradicated you have just as much in common with ancient Egyptians, as whites do today.  Your culture is what you make of it today, and it's possible that it can even be better than ancient Egypt. No need to tear you, and your family from American culture to pursue a culture 97% of black Americans will consider alien.   Let's white and black pursue American cultures without the wars, which was independence.  independence from your electric company independence from your water provider independence from your food provider. independence from these fuel barons.  independence from the US government.  An intensely independent mindset and freedom to do whatever you want when you want the way you want. Not sleeping on headstands or wearing soul charms or ankhs or other nonsense that you would look like a fool doing in today's world.

Many people use the name of God to commit atrocities. Isn't it the best way to manipulate people into hating God? I think yes, and people are fooled by it.

It's like the writers completely disregarded the Biblical story of Moses and made up their own version of what happened. Moses didn't even part the Red Sea!!!! And that's what he's basically known for in the Bible!!!!!!! I could go on and on, but I'll just get myself riled up. Bottom line: Hollywood needs to stop putting out Biblically based movies. They're completely inaccurate and almost insulting to the Christian faith. Even putting aside my religious beliefs, this was boring through and through.  Good luck Hollywood. I certainly won't be going to see another one of your ""Biblical Reboots."" To anyone considering watching this movie, I suggest you go do something more productive like sleeping.

He was a man who looked like he was from the north,     of dark complexity was the man, of olive was the color of his skin,     and his eyes, they had a calmness bound by a fierce strength. He looked as if his eyes carried the weight of every slave,     his eyes were windows to a soul pure entirely,     looking into their depths, made me lose my fear.  from the book GOD VISITS A SLAVE, available on Amazon Kindle  I wrote a story not that different from the story of Moses, the only difference is  that it's all about a slave who meets a man who he later finds is GOD. the story is an allegory of Moses, Job and even David, it teaches us about struggles, and what to do in times of trouble, and it also teaches us the secret of God's nature, and we learn more about him while He reveals scripture after scripture to the young man, and while He keeps His promises to the SLAVE as He did in His Word.

Alors que le film montre l'intervention de gros crocodiles qui attaquèrent les bateaux et mangèrent ceux qui s'y trouvaient. L'eau ensuite se changeait en sang. Voici ce que dit le texte biblique: ""Aaron leva la verge, et il frappa les eaux qui étaient dans le fleuve, sous les yeux de Pharaon et sous les yeux de ses serviteurs ; et toutes les eaux du fleuve furent changées en sang"". Je vous déconseille d'acheter ce film et de gaspiller votre argent pour rien. Exode 7:14-25 L'Éternel dit à Moïse : Pharaon a le coeur endurci ; il refuse de laisser aller le peuple. Va vers Pharaon dès le matin ; il sortira pour aller près de l'eau, et tu te présenteras devant lui au bord du fleuve. Tu prendras à ta main la verge qui a été changée en serpent, et tu diras à Pharaon : L'Éternel, le Dieu des Hébreux, m'a envoyé auprès de toi, pour te dire : Laisse aller mon peuple, afin qu'il me serve dans le désert. Et voici, jusqu'à présent tu n'as point écouté. Ainsi parle l'Éternel : A ceci tu connaîtras que je suis l'Éternel. Je vais frapper les eaux du fleuve avec la verge qui est dans ma main ; et elles seront changées en sang. Les poissons qui sont dans le fleuve périront, le fleuve se corrompra, et les Égyptiens s'efforceront en vain de boire l'eau du fleuve. L'Éternel dit à Moïse : Dis à Aaron : Prends ta verge, et étends ta main sur les eaux des Égyptiens, sur leurs rivières, sur leurs ruisseaux, sur leurs étangs, et sur tous leurs amas d'eaux. Elles deviendront du sang : et il y aura du sang dans tout le pays d'Égypte, dans les vases de bois et dans les vases de pierre. Moïse et Aaron firent ce que l'Éternel avait ordonné. Aaron leva la verge, et il frappa les eaux qui étaient dans le fleuve, sous les yeux de Pharaon et sous les yeux de ses serviteurs ; et toutes les eaux du fleuve furent changées en sang. Les poissons qui étaient dans le fleuve périrent, le fleuve se corrompit, les Égyptiens ne pouvaient plus boire l'eau du fleuve, et il y eut du sang dans tout le pays d'Égypte. Mais les magiciens d'Égypte en firent autant par leurs enchantements. Le coeur de Pharaon s'endurcit, et il n'écouta point Moïse et Aaron, selon ce que l'Éternel avait dit. Pharaon s'en retourna, et alla dans sa maison ; et il ne prit pas même à coeur ces choses. Tous les Égyptiens creusèrent aux environs du fleuve, pour trouver de l'eau à boire ; car ils ne pouvaient boire de l'eau du fleuve. Il s'écoula sept jours, après que l'Éternel eut frappé le fleuve.",0,0,Peace on the earth 43,t-8YsulfxVI,0.16666666666666666,2018-01-25 21:54:44,False,False

2018-11-22T17:29:36,"Its supposed to be a story about Moses and God's deliverance for the Hebrews to set them free from the bondage and slavery by Egyptians. I bought this movie because I saw the trailer and I thought it was good biblical movie because I saw the ten plagues. But I was wrong, when I watched it, I saw that its another wanna be christian movie that doesn't show the true essence of the biblical true story that is from the Bible.   There was part of the scene in the movie that showed the burning bush and I was really disappointed because thats the part where God talked to Moses and Moses was reverent in the presence of God, where God also told Moses to remove the sandals from his feet because he was standing on a Holy ground. But they made God into a child in that scene and didn't even have the biblical dialogue between God and  Moses. They changed it and made up their own conversation.   They also failed to reach the acceptable biblical character of Moses in that movie. They have made him irreverent towards God, there were scenes that Moses yelled at God blaming Him for taking him away from his family. When the truth was, God didn't take Moses away from his wife, his wife journeyed with him to Egypt when he was chosen to lead the Hebrews freedom from slavery and out of Egypt. I was so disappointed with how they made Moses in that movie. He was supposed to be the most humblest man in the face of the earth, and didn't use weapons and force against Pharoah but a simple Rod in his hands glorifying the power of God, sending plagues in Egypt. But in that movie, Moses didn't even have the Rod, and that was my favorite thing about Moses.  They also made God look bad in that movie, depicting as a killer. Pharaoh said in that movie "" What kind of God that kills? who worships this kind of God?"" After the plagues and the first borns lives where taken away. First of all, God is Judge and He gives life, and He has the right to take it away what belongs to Him. Nothing belongs to us. Our lives are borrowed from God. He gives, but when He takes away, May His Name be Praised! Because everything in Heaven and on earth belongs to HIM! So he has the right to Judge Egypt and after all, the Pharaoh was stubborn and didn't take heed to let God's people go. He made God his enemy and who can win against God? No one.  All in all, I was excited to watch the movie and paid for it  because I thought that this movie had a great opportunity to glorify God with its special effects during the scenes of  ten plagues. But Hollywood ruined the true biblical story in that movie. What a waste! That movie had the opportunity to Glorify God with its special effects  and spread the message across towards people, but they ruined it. There were a lot of scenes in that movie that was false in the essence of biblical truth in nature. ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Prince Of Egypt"" were far batter.",0,0,Baby Wally,t-8YsulfxVI,0.1600446428571428,2018-11-22 17:29:36,False,False

The team then compared the ancient mummy DNA to the DNA of both ancient and modern people in the same region. It turns out that, on a genetic level, the ancient Egyptians aren’t so different from modern people living in the Near East. In fact, they have more in common with those in the Near East than today’s Egyptians. For example, the mummies didn’t have any DNA from sub-Saharan Africa, whereas about 20 percent of today’s Egyptians have sub-Saharan genes.

It’s unfortunate to say that only Islam still upholds the true stories of the prophets. Islam today in the Quran for those who choose to read from it the story of Moses see the wisdom and spiritual qualities in his struggle to free the Hebrew slaves. People need to wake up and realize they’re being desensitized and deceived from the true qualities and ways of Gods prophets.
