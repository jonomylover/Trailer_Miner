2015-02-09T11:28:17,"""GERMAN MILITARY messages enciphered on the Enigma machine were first broken by the POLISH CIPHER BUREAU, beginning in December 1932. This success was a result of efforts by three Polish cryptologists, MARIAN REJEWSKI, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski, working for Polish military intelligence. Rejewski ""reverse-engineered"" the device, using theoretical mathematics and material supplied by French military intelligence. Subsequently the three mathematicians designed mechanical devices for breaking Enigma ciphers, including the cryptologic bomb. From 1938 onwards, additional complexity was repeatedly added to the Enigma machines, making decryption more difficult and necessitating larger numbers of equipment and personnel—more than the Poles could readily produce. On 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Poles initiated French and British military intelligence representatives into their Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment, including Zygalski sheets and the cryptologic bomb, and promised each delegation a Polish-reconstructed Enigma. The demonstration represented a vital basis for the later British continuation and effort.[3] During the war, British cryptologists decrypted a vast number of messages enciphered on Enigma. The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed ""Ultra"" by the British, was a substantial aid to the Allied war effort.[4]"" from Wikipedia/ Enigma﻿  So, British did not beak ENIGMA !!!!
