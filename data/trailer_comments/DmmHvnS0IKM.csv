Irony is that I actually got criticized for not knowing any Spanish. I couldn't grip the language in high school and was further criticized for not listening to my culture's music. My question was: How could I connect to music tied to a culture whose people constantly beat me down and had high expectations? I never really had a taste in music until high school where I discovered rock and metal. From themes of telling people to get out of your face to dealing with inner demons, this genre got me through a lot. I didn't care what was popular.

The film was a-w-e-s-o-m-e with music of the times (late 80's) but mostly Bruce Springsteen songs. The director, writer, producer of the film Gurinder Chadha was here in the house to do questions and answers. She said she got the author of the original book to work with her to write the screenplay for this film. Chadha also met Bruce Springsteen and spoke with him about the movie and screenplay and he gave the story his approval himself.  I laughed and cried and tapped my feet during this film. I loved how the Boss's music was integrated into the story. Almost everyone will identify with feeling estranged from parents while growing up and struggling to find your way while dealing with pressure from parents.

To put yourself in the shoes of a family coming to a new land.There is adjustment to a different culture, made all the more poignant by a generation gap, the inevitable cruelty to anyone ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô, and a young man caught in the middle of it all, who finds the songs of a certain musician helping him believe in himself, and follow his dreams. A little campy, corny? For sure, and corny is good in ‚Äò Blinded By The Light‚Äô. We could use some good, down to earth, story telling these days. Thank you for allowing this movie to get made.

Imagine Billy Elliot with clumsy direction, poor and cringy dialogue and unlikable main characters. It‚Äôs literally Billy Elliot, but pakistani. I feel bad for Pakistan for this monstrosity of a snooze fest. The main character is literally a 16 year old who listens to Bruce Springsteen once, and then makes his entire personality about worshipping the singer. The movie brings nothing new to the table at all, many of the scenes are pointless. I feel bad for the actor, but most of the time I wanted to smack the main character‚Äôs stupid smile off his face. Really? You get a girlfriend and you decide to literally sing lyrics who someone else wrote to her face instead of talking to her? That aspect of his obsession with Springsteen reminded me of the Rose Byrne movie ‚ÄúJuliet, naked‚Äù. I‚Äôd recommend watching that movie instead of this garbage. First the Dave Chapelle special, and now this. I‚Äôm starting to not trust rotten tomatoes anymore.",0,0,N√¶p S√¶ck,DmmHvnS0IKM,-0.030717108977978552,2019-11-03 13:44:39,False,True
