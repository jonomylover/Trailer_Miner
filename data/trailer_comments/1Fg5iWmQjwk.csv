The rest are ok at best, and I thought Moonrise was awful. But Ralph Fiennes just brings such an infectious charisma to this film that it's impossible for me not to enjoy. The film is delightfully absurd. Anderson can suck all the humor from even the otherwise genius Bill Murray, but not Ralph Fiennes.

2014-08-04T15:36:44,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is probably one of the best of the year (probably in the top 10) and lets talk about why that is  The Characters: The main protagonist, M. Gustave, is an incredibly despicable hero. I mean it, everything this character says and does are probably the stupidest and cold-hearted things a person can say in real life. BUT! Thanks to Wes Anderson & Hugo Guinness' screenplay and Anderson's writing, they managed to make him very likable. There are usually main protagonists that you love to hate or just want to smack in the face. Thankfully, he falls into the former category. Another thing that helps is Ralph Fiennes' performance. If you watch this film again, you can see how much Fiennes eats up the part, he's just enjoying every minute of it and it's hard for you not get sucked in and enjoy it along with him. Fiennes is one of those actors who's never played the same character in every film. He's played the Pharaoh of Egypt (The Prince of Egypt), A Serial Killer (Red Dragon), he's even been a f**king Nazi (Schindler's List), HOW THE HELL DID THAT HAPPEN!… Anyways, but they've never been the same character. Tony Revolori as Zero Mustafa is also pretty likable too. I mean, sure he sounds like a Guatemalan version of Jesse Eisenberg, but like I said earlier, the Screenplay and the Writing are what helps the movie. And the friendship between Gustave & Zero is actually very genuine and believable. And the side characters are pretty likable and memorable as well. Saoirse Ronan, Adrian Brody, Willem DaFoe, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Lea Seydoux, HELL, even Jeff Goldblum is likable in this movie, HOW DO YOU MAKE JEFF GOLDBLUM LIKABLE!  The Screenplay and Writing: As I said before, Wes Anderson and Hugo Guinness' screenplay and Anderson's writing are what makes the movie good  The Cinematography: This films cinematography is probably some of the best I've ever seen in a while (and this is coming from a 13 year old). Wes Anderson's typical long angle shots work really well here. And what I like about the film more is that everything is real, the building in the movie is REALLY the building they got, all the people they got are REALLY the people they got, NO CGI AT ALL, and I f**king love that!  The Story: Now the film's story is nothing really new, just the typical ""somebody gets killed and the heroes get framed for it and go on an adventure to find the real culprit"". HOWEVER! Unlike all those other stories, the killer is never revealed at the end. Yeah, you read right, they never reveal the killer. I guess Anderson & Guinness just decided to leave it to the viewers imagination  If theres only one thing I would nitpick, it's the scene where DaFoe's character kills Goldblum's. The problem I have with the scene is…WHY DIDN'T DAFOE EAT THE FINGERS! After DaFoe finishes killing Goldblum, he picks up Goldblum's fingers (which got cut when Dafoe closed the door on them) and puts them in his pocket. WHY DIDN'T HE EAT THEM! I want to see Willem DaFoe eat dismembered fingers, NOT put them in his POCKET!!!!

When deputy covax drops the stack of papers on the table one flies off and lands near the edge. When Mr. Gustav and Zero form a 'sacred blood pact' and Gustav hands the paper over to Zero, Zero fumbles with the paper for a moment and catches it. The clock in the kitchen of Mendle's syncs to the background music when they first introduce Agatha. I love how 'our mutual friends predecessor' steps back into the frame when he is mentioned. 'The author', Jude Law's character, is uninterested in the 'parenthetical domestic drama' of a man chocking to death. Inspector Hankel seems slightly uncomfortable when Gustav tells him regarding his mother ""I adore her, send my love."" When Gustav kisses the corpse of Madam D, Zero and Plateild exchange glances. Gustav expressing rage after saying 'the one with the clubfoot?'  lots more i cant remember, but this film is filled to the brim with subtle humor and light touches that add to a really wonderful experience",7,0,licenseless rider,1Fg5iWmQjwk,0.21547619047619052,2016-06-06 05:22:07,False,False
