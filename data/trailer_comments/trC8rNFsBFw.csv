Read ""Just The Funny Parts"" by Nell Scovell - as a writer she worked on the David Letterman Show, Murphy Brown, Newhart, Coach, The Simpsons...... and THIS movie bears no relation to what things were like... the casting of buffoon-guys when they were in reality bullies and smart sharks is terrible. Mindy Kaling is fantasizing about Writers Rooms - the reality is Much Funnier/sharper than her writing for this kitschy movie.
