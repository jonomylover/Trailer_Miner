2018-09-27T05:46:55,"First thoughts after watching the trailer: Either history is unfortunately repeated, and Adonis dies in the ring, or Adonis is victorious while sustaining permanent damage that will show itself in future films. I would prefer the latter if the Creed movies continue in the future, but I'm also not completely in love with Adonis as a character. In that regard, as much as it was emphasized in the first Creed that it was not focusing on Rocky as the main protagonist, I can't help but think of these Creed movies as ultimately Rocky's story. Hence, with this mindset, I would the first scenario where Adonis dies in the ring, perhaps even in Rocky's arms to really emphasize past memories. All in all, I'm just hoping not to see a perfect happy ending as seeing this trailer giving off a darker vibe. Whether that means Adonis dying, or being victorious in a close death match ultimately leaving him with serious permanent brain damage as Rocky warned him about. Those were my thoughts I really needed to get off my chest. Tell me what you think. I also would find it amazing if Adonis beats Drago's son, but dies in his corner after the last round.

I love black people over all other people even over my own! I don't care if Asians continued to be ridiculed because Asians are also the most racist in the world and they treat black people horribly. A group of Chinese colonizers came to Uganda and punched a Ugandan governmental official for not allowing them to continue illegally mining. And then theres this exhibit in China comparing Africans to animals. Are those the type of creatures that I should be in support of just because I'm Asian???

They need to maintain that transformation in the character as Drago if they are going to do justice to the best Rocky movie. There is so much more here than a Russia v.s.

Creed 1 did a great job of introducing Adonis and having Rocky be his mentor. Really looking forward to seeing this movie.

2018-10-03T21:17:24,"Two things I hope happen in this movie.  First, I hope Rocky makes things right with Mrs. Creed.  In the first Creed movie, Adonis said Rocky hasn't spoken to her since Apollo's funeral and that's sad.  Second, I would love for Apollo to be able to talk to Adonis, whether it is his voice, a vision, or both, especially considering who Adonis is fighting. Perhaps during the fight, that can happen, especially when Adonis is in trouble and/or he gets knocked down.",0,0,Dont Blink,u22BXhMu4tI,0.08455988455988456,2018-10-03 21:17:24,True,True

2018-10-17T08:58:57,"In my mind before the film: Drago's son is only fighting Adonis to prove to his father, Ivan, that he's not a failure. Something like Adonis went through in the the 1st Creed film.  While, Ivan is still holding so much anger for losing to Rocky, making it personal. Maybe even hate guilt for killing Adonis dad, Apollo.  Yet, Adonis wants revenge and proving that he has what it takes to be the greatest, even if it means fighting his father's killer's son. A personal vendetta.  Lastly, Rocky is still by Adonis no matter any obstacle. Since Adonis reminds Rocky of what it's like still to fight for something, while still developing a father-son relationship. Even in reality its sad that Sylvester's son died, leaving him an empty emotional love-care for a son. In my view, Rocky sees Adonis as his son.  In my mind for the ending of the film: I only hope Drago's son can be much more than his Father, Ivan. While, Ivan can learn to accept his defeat and possibly make amends to both Rocky and Adonis. While, Adonis becomes the right role model for many fighters, even being a father too. Lastly, Rocky will be thanked and forgiven by Mary-Ann for being the right person needed every time for Adonis, as a father, rather than being a trainer.",2,1,Jesus Salazar,u22BXhMu4tI,0.04367167919799498,2018-10-17 08:58:57,True,True

I totally enjoyed working with the one and only ""Rocky""! As to Michael B. Jordan, he apparently is too young and self-absorbed to realize that it's the fans that help him keep a job. He was rude, arrogant and quite the snob! He may be handsome, but looks aren't everything. He wouldn't even acknowledge a hello from many of us working on set. He just stomped off to his trailer and slammed the door after every scene he was in.

Talking of acting I believe we must hear it for MBJ, the dude is truly intense and focused in every scene of his. It's the heart and soul of this new saga like Sly was in Rocky's. BTW all Rocky's moments in Creed II are pure gold, regardless if he speaks Family or Boxing. That being said the core of this movie is the two Dragos, their own relationship and how that ends up in a new, better beginning for them. If I must find a flaw in this movie I'd say it's the slow pace it shows in those ""a few too many"" Adonis/Bianca moments. And of course we kinda must forget that Creed I was all about Light Heavyweights while Creed II is about Heavyweights, I must suppose that was necessary because of Florian's size.

2019-03-09T03:34:17,"Here is my Creed 3 idea/concept - Creed 3  The concept  - It‚Äôs been 3 years since Adonis has fought Victor Drago  - Rocky has passed away from cancer    - Adonis has lost his passion for boxing and is struggling with depression over the lost of Rocky  - A New Heavy Weight Champion has been chosen by the US boxing committee due to Adonis failure to defend his title  - Young brash Ublado ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù Sanchez, an American Hispanic gold medalist wants to cement his legacy as the best pound for pound fighter but needs to beat Adonis to officially be recognized as the greatest in his era   - Ublado is undefeated, younger and more skilled  - Adonis‚Äôs wife, Bianca, has lost her hearing completely and their challenge is how to not only communicate with each other but how to raise their 3 yr old daughter who is also deaf  - Bianca lost her music deal and is struggling to find peace with her hearing lost and becoming a mother.  - Adonis is stressed and struggling to understand how to be a father to a deaf child  - Adonis‚Äô mother comes to stay with the family and helps out wile giving advice and teaching moments to her son about rising a family.  - Adonis trainer, Tony ‚ÄúLittle Duke‚Äù Burton tries to rekindle Adonis‚Äôs love for fighting by taking him to one of Ublado‚Äôs title defense matches.  - Ublado notices that Adonis is in the crowd and confronts him after his victory fight  - Adonis ignores Ublado‚Äôs requests to fight him  - Bianca noticing that Adonis‚Äôs depression has taken a toll she starts to urge him to get back in the ring   - Adonis excepts Ublado‚Äôs challenge  - Press conference is very much a spectacle event for Ublao  - Adonis goes back to Philly (where it all started: Go back to the basics) to train  - Adonis is struggling to train and temporally gives up  - Rocky‚Äôs son Robert hears that Adonis is struggling and shows up in Philly to help motivate Adonis to fight.  Robert gives Adonis the gold boxing glove neckless that Rocky gave him; the same neckless Micky gave to Rocky.  A scene of loss and love or passing on the torch  - Adonis beats Ublado in the 12 rounds by knockout     Adonis:  Training Scene   - Back in Philly and in the old gym where he trained in Creed 1; Same training staff except Tony is now part of Adonis‚Äôs team like he was in Creed 2.  - Adonis‚Äôs needs to become not only faster but quicker  - Trains old school; blood sweat and tears  - Final scene in the training montage; Adonis running up the rocky steps with power and honor for Rocky (highly emotional music and gritty expressions on Adonis face)  Ublado:  Training Scene   - Upper class Olympic boxing facility  - Multiple super talented sparing partners, state of the art training; Ublado is aggressive and arrogant  Fight scene  - Fight is in Las Vegas  - Bianca and their daughter do not attend the fight until the final round  - Adonis is getting plumaged by the speed and quickness of Ublado  - Ublado starts to fatigue in the final round  - Adonis starts to get a 2nd breath and starts winning the 12 rounds  - The final knockout scene is similar to Rocky 2 as both Ublado and Adonis fall down  - The referee is starts counting   - The feeling is a high pressure, heart pounding as both boxers fall to the ground  - Adonis is bloody and his vision is blurred the room is spinning  he‚Äôs exhausted he can‚Äôt hear the crowd chanting his name but catches a glimpse of his daughter in the crowd holding up her hands in sign language ‚ÄúI love you Daddy‚Äù  - Adonis with all his might pulls himself up off the rope and wins!   - Adonis is crying and holding his daughter along with his wife   -     Themes in the movie  - Go back to the basics  - Irony in the characters; Adonis becomes more Rocky than Creed and Ublado is more Creed   - Ubalod is a cocky, condescending, pampered athletic and much more talented boxer than Adonis  - Adonis is broken emotionally and struggling to find relevance as a boxer now that Rocky is gone  - The Creed family‚Äôs new dynamic is how to communicate now that wife and child are deaf    Final Scene",0,0,T.

2020-03-29T01:28:40,"I enjoyed this movie even if it was basically a repeat & retelling of Rocky 4... If this franchise, as in Creed, is seriously going to try & build on the previous movies then Sly Stallone needs to give up being in them as the focus is detracting from the character of Adonis (Johnson) Creed...  Even Sly knew to get a better response in the 3rd Rocky movie that the character of Mickey his father figure/mentir & trainer had to die & Rocky had to find his own path by picking himself up & fighting the character of Clubber Lang again...  The early Rocky movies worked because of its heart & the relationships with those specific character's in these movie's but 7 Rocky movies later & 2 Creed films & Sly still won't give up playing Rocky...  7 Rocky movies in any franchise is a phenomenal run even if the films gradually got worse with Rocky V being the lowest point & then the reinvention by going down the Son of Apollo Creed & building from there gave them another 2¬† films but the character of Adonis Creed needs to find his own path within these boxing movies...  We all know how much Sly loves boxing & no other actor has done such a great & positive outcome with the legacy of Rocky films as that character inspires people in real life to keeping moving forward no matter what life throws at us, but it's hard to be interested in Rocky or the characters within these movies after the 9th film...  I watched this movie again tonight to try & take it on its own merits but there's next to nothing on screen that hasn't already been done, in fact over done...  After watching I thought I'd look into if there would be anymore & I couldn't believe one of the pitches that Sly Stallone said after this movie was finished... Sly wanted Deonaty Wilder to play the Son of Clubber Lang, now that's seriously lazy & is going back chronologically through the Rocky films... It's time to let the Creed character step up & not have Rocky in it...  In this movie Creed felt afraid that he couldn't live up to his father's achievements & that's why he lost as his mind was not in the fight, if anything the Creed character & anymore films has a bigger shadow looming over them & that's the character of Rocky himself...  Sly can still write or co-write the script & direct but I think he's doing the Creed films a disservice if he continues to star in them...  I've followed Slys career since Lords Of The Flatbush & he's created 2 very unique iconic cult characters with Rocky & Rambo but it's time to let those character's to rest & i think Michael B Jordan deserves to take over from Slys character of Rocky as it's just playing out the exact same scenarios but with a different character...  I know in boxing the final decision of the winner in any fight is either going to go only a set amount of ways but at least let Michael B Jordan carry the character of Creed by himself...  Ok I'll admit that there's no way you could've had a Creed vs Drago fight without Sly & Dolph being in the same movie as thats a Box Office draw on its own but I honestly don't see anymore miles that can be added on to an already over made franchise unless Sly cuts loose & he isn't in them anymore but continues on with the stories of Creeds achievements...  Creed couldn't even beat Drago until Creed was trained by Rocky & I get why that was done as a normal thing to do & an obvious thing to do with the narrative of these films but¬† enough is enough...  That's what made Rocky 3 special as he wanted & needed Mickey in his corner after the defeat to Clubber Lang but he had to take that next step & journey if you will without Mickey & dig deep to find a way to defeat his opponent...  Even Michael B Jordan must be thinking there's no more to do with the character of Creed unless there's a real shake up as it's going over old ground that's already been covered... We have new characters to care about without the need to physically have the Rocky character & he can always be there in flashbacks but we'll just have to wait & see if they & I mean Sly goes for yet another part as Rocky but this time training someone else...   .....",0,0,YouTube Is An Influencer,u22BXhMu4tI,0.1092945992499564,2020-03-29 01:28:40,False,False
