2018-12-25T17:23:38,"FULL DISCLAIMER:  MY POSTS ARE ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO READ:  FULL ""US"" TRAILER REVIEW  REJECTING THE NOMENCLATURE OF WHITE SUPREMACY:  BLACK IMMIGRANTS IN BLACK FACE  Nuance required. I'm with Samuel L. Jackson. Love Peele's storytelling brilliance. Hate Peele's casting decisions -- the routine casting of black immigrants in roles depicting black Americans is very problematic for me and no different than white people in blackface. Black immigrants people are not ""black"" in their native countries and only become black when they reach American soil. They are only associated with ""Us"" because of the shared phenotype of melanin.    Black immigrants are replacing black Americans at light-speed in white universities, corporate America and especially Hollywood where even more recently immigrants were cast as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife Coretta Scott King in the movie Selma. It must be noted that all of the artistic depictions of Dr. King over the last 40 years has been by people outside of his tribe--his statute at the Georgia capitol (white sculptor), his statute as his national memorial in D.C. (Chinese sculptor) and the depiction of him and his wife on film in Selma (British Nigerians). I agree with Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Adichie who says ""I want African realities to be explored by Africans."" Likewise, I want black American realities explored by black Americans. I also agreed with Ugandan activists who opposed Forrest Whitaker's casting as Idi Amin in ""The Last King of Scotland."" Black immigrants are not black Americans (and vice versa). They just play ""Us"" on TV. None of ""Us"" could go to Nigeria or any part of Africa and enjoy the same rights amongst their people as they enjoy here passing as ""Us."" Furthermore, Nigerians, in particular, and several other African nations were directly culpable for selling ""Us"" in to slavery. The thought that ""they"" can now replace ""Us"" on film, in the classroom, and in the board room is beyond reprehensible.    Ironically, Jamaican American legal scholar and first tenured ""black"" woman faculty member at Harvard Law, Lani Guinier, has been writing extensively about the phenomenon of ""model"" black immigrants replacing ""undesirable"" black Americans or ""preferred blackness."" Affirmative Action was not intended for black immigrants but for American Descendants of Slaves (see Executive Orders 10925 and 11246 by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson respectively or President Lyndon Johnson's 1965 Howard University Commencement Address).    Yet people who did not fight our fight are taking the benefits of that fight. Slaves and immigrants should never be confused as members of the same tribe. In many ways the slave was beneath the immigrant. The Trans-Atlantic slave trade was not immigration. It was theft. It was kidnapping. It was torture. It was murder. The immigrant's migration was by choice. The slave's migration was not. The black immigrant fled their country. They did not stay and fight to make their country better. The black immigrant by definition is unpatriotic. The descendant of slaves is by definition the ultimate patriot. The descendant of slaves stayed and fought to make their country better. Black immigrants are runners by definition. Descendants of slaves are fighters. A runner can't lecture a fighter about anything.    The immigrant flees their country to take refuge in another. The descendant of slaves did not leave or abandon their country, but stayed and fought to make its country's Constitutional ideals applicable to them. The latter did not fight to make its country better, but fled to another country to take the rights of people who look like them. This is not an exercise in solidarity, but an exercise in theft. Rejecting white supremacy means rejecting its nomenclature, which assigns group membership based upon melanin or non-melanin content of skin. The inability to think in nuance is what allows black immigrants to ""pass"" as black Americans or a better terminology American Descendant of Slaves (ADOS). Putting black immigrants in HBCU sweaters does not make them black Americans (ADOS).    Rejecting white supremacy means rejecting its nomenclature, which assigns group membership based upon melanin or non-melanin content of skin. The inability to think in nuance is what allows black immigrants to ""pass"" as black Americans in the same manner many Jewish people have been afforded the opportunity to ""pass"" as white Americans. We need a full rejection of the nomenclature of white supremacy. No longer should black immigrants be allowed to claim membership to a group based on melanin content of skin.    We must become more specific in group designations by adding Nigerian American, Caribbean American and others to our job applications, college applications and census forms. No more convoluting all of ""Us"" into one group based on the magical nonbiological illusion of race or melanin content of skin. No Russian, German, Brit, Scot, Irish, or Frenchman would ever allow you to confuse or convolute all of them into one group based on the lack of melanin in their skin. Likewise, we must reject and abandon the idea of this ""one drop"" unnuanced grouping of people because of the phenotype of melanin. To do so is to grant authority and legitimacy to white supremacy.    Nevertheless, I applaud Mr. Peele for his unbridled ability to reimagine race on film all while detesting his highly problematic casting decisions. ""Get Out"" was just the beginning of his genius. Hopefully, ""Us"" will be the end of his poor casting decisions.

2018-12-26T01:05:03,"When life gets rough there's always one thing we can go back to and feel like everything is alright. In my opinion that thing is good music. There have been so many days before when I was younger where everything seemed so overwhelmingly negative... Like there was no light at the end of my tunnel. But then I started listening to my favorite musicians and somehow it made me feel some sort of way... Almost like a hope entered into my life. At that moment I knew what my dream in life was.     I wanted to produce and make music like my favorite artists. I knew I'd never be able to even afford a MIDI keyboard so it stayed a dream, buried deep inside me never to see the light of day. Until now that is. Here I am a few years later and I'm making the music I'd always look for but never could find. This journey in my life has been amazing... And I want to help people feel the same way by listening to the music I create... I wanna be able to make great memories for other people. I want people to hear my music and let it change their day for the better! That's why I started making music. üåå    They're very spacey and futuristic. They make you feel like your life is part of something bigger! It's almost like your being whisked away to another galaxy... I'm not trying to boast. I'm just trying to help you all feel good vibes. And in 2018, I think alot more people need that. If you could help me out by checking my songs it would mean so much. I promise you won't regret it. Thank you for being one of my first fans if you choose to listen. üôè I'll forever remember the first people who supported me... <3",22,0,M V,hNCmb-4oXJA,0.2581896551724138,2018-12-26 01:05:03,True,True

Fears come to the forefront that we never thought we would have to battle within ourselves. Now it's do or die time. You fight those inner fears or demons to save yourself which means cutting them off at the head or letting them cut you off. In turn which mean them taking you over and eventually you dying.

2018-12-26T02:27:06,"My theory:  Everything as to do with the mother (Lupita). First in the car, she was out of the rythme. Secondly, when the son disappeared, she worried about him which is normal.  But, her type of fear was sort of weird, as if she knew something. Especially, when she found him at the beach. As if she was afraid that someone, she knew would get in touch with the boy. At 1:16, she is on the phone and her voice slightly change, it‚Äôs a little abnormal almost like the ‚Äúbe careful‚Äù when she told the girl to put her shoes on and her eyes are unusually open. The scene when she comes right after the girl in the bedroom indicates, she knew that she was in danger.   Per definition, she knows who they or what they are. Then at 1:31 her eyes are wildly open too, she was beyond than frightened. Another keyword is ‚ÄúI got 5 on it‚Äù, yet we only see that they are 4, but there is the little girl. The one who strangled herself and once again walking by herself on the beach.  Compare to the family members, she is way much younger than the principal daughter, who we saw her US version among the other ones. The little girl must be related to the mom or maybe a deceased family member.   The black rabbit also means something. Rabbits in general symbolize family, community or awareness. They also represent good luck, abundance and success, but in this case, the rabbit is black among white ones. It reminds a little bit of the ugly duckling, in this scenario, the rabbit is the imposter among the other as if it does not belong among them.   There is also the fact that the blonde woman at 2:08 holds also a pair of scissors and also the woman at 2:00 is a victim. So, they must be other US version too. Also based on what I found on the meaning of scissors: ‚ÄúIn ancient civilizations in the past, biblical meaning of scissors will always be associated with the supernatural world. That is, the gods and demons appear in his dreams. When biblical meaning of scissors as a beautiful and happy vision that is defined as the presence of God, whereas biblical meaning of scissors become a nightmare then this is a sign of the existence of evil spirits or demons when humans sleep.‚Äù  Additionally the description says: ‚ÄúHaunted by an unexplainable and unresolved trauma from her past and compounded by a string of eerie coincidences, Adelaide feels her paranoia elevate to high-alert as she grows increasingly‚Äù ‚Äúpeople with paranoid personalities are not usually psychotic; that is, most of the time they are in clear contact with reality, although they may experience transient psychotic symptoms during periods of stress. Whereas, people with paranoid schizophrenia share some symptoms found in paranoid personality, but they have many additional problems including more persistent loss of contact with reality, delusions, and hallucinations.‚Äù The fact of coming back to her childhood place must have triggered something in her or maybe all this time, she is having an episode.

2018-12-26T02:37:51,"That scissor imagery has me thinking this will speak on the consequences of trying to cut out parts of yourself. Obviously, the immediate response is that killing these ""clones"" is the way to go, but what would that say on a metaphorical level to kill the worst of yourself?     Yeah, you have aspects of yourself that you consider awful but they are still parts of what makes you whole. You need the bad parts of yourself. You need the things that make you fearful.

And she vowed to restore it back to its original condition, and she did. Now, that my friends, is what God has done to us, we, broken vessels, faulty, unfit, and sinful has he chosen to redeem and restore unto perfection so that we may be given a crown of glory in the next life to come.

Their daughter is not so young, so it can be young Adelaide. cause ""Haunted by an unexplainable and unresolved trauma from her past and compounded by a string of eerie coincidences, Adelaide feels her paranoia elevate to high-alert as she grows increasingly "" It means Adelaide already met her Dark Doppelganger when she was young. And this beach can be some kind of starting point of this nightmare... Like mind trigger. 2. Song meaning. A lot of drug/dope meanings also connected with Lab Rabbits in cages which reminds of some experiments with people (Like in ""Get out"" movie). Like they are just ""guinea pigs"" of some trial. 3. Everybody dies around, but they are safe all the time. ""If you want to get crazy, we can get crazy."" Depends on who are ""you"" and who are ""we"" this one can take one more meaning. 4. Mask on their son. He looks pretty sticked to it and it looks very unnatural. 5. Scissors - symbol of life and death. At the same time they mean union (the two parts act as one) and the gap (they cut the thread of life). The attribute of the Greek goddess of fate, Moira Atropos. Atropos was the oldest of the Three Fates, and was known as the ""inflexible"" or ""inevitable.""

(Notice how the girl with pigtails isn‚Äôt their daughter) and she tells her family about them and that they must kill them.     This can also be symbolic to trauma that we often leave behind and the doppelg√§ngers are embodiments of said trauma and they must kill them in order to let the trauma go emotionally (or let it consume you. I.e they kill you)   Also for the ending I‚Äôm assuming that Lupitas character ends up murdering one or all of her family out of paranoia.

This seems like such a crazy twist on duality and has an almost modern Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde vibe to it. Knowing Peele everyone might be super wrong on all these theories, but I definitely believe there is something very strange about Lupita's character and the son. The vibes from them seem completely different than the older sister and the father and then the little girl doesn't seem to be part of the family so who exactly js she? Could it be the mother and son are actually  the ""imposters"" and now these ""twin"" entities are there to reveal that? So many thoughts going through my head.

The family from that were completely predatory and obviously everyone was scared what would happen to the main character cuz they did a ton of messed up stuff. THIS family though? This is terrifying. Like getting caught in the trap of the family from Get Out is scary, but the ‚Äúother‚Äù family in the jumpsuits? Terrifying. Like, no matter who you are, you feel like you need to keep an eye open for them terrifying, that‚Äôs not even touching what it would be like if you‚Äôre in the shoes of the main character or her family, someone who knows your every move is trying to kill you takes this group, who‚Äôs already a threat, and makes them even MORE of a threat. It‚Äôs scary. And that‚Äôs all conveyed in 1 single trailer. Enough to catch my interest, me being someone who doesn‚Äôt like horror and is easily scared.

This film IMO is about how we as black people attempt to bury/supress our roots/past in the quest for white upward mobility. The dialogue in the car and subsequent signs of upward mobility (the boat, the vacation etc.) teases this. This appears to be a film about how we will grow up in the hood, attend tough urban public schools, and go to HBCU‚Äôs, only to try and bury that past by moving to exclusive white neighborhoods and sending our kids to white private schools. Yet, we will quietly continue to appropriate and consume black urban culture (as documented in how the parents ironically talk about not doing drugs to the kids,  all while listening to a classic hip-hop song....that glorifies drug use.

2018-12-26T16:26:09,"I know this comment has nothing to be with the message but it is very important for you.  the Prince of Peace, is the only One who can give us unshakable peace in a world of turmoil. As someone said, ""There will never be peace in the individual heart or at the peace tables of the world until the Prince of Peace reigns supreme in the hearts of men."" Jesus said, ""Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid""(John 14:27). He also said, ""Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest""(Matthew 11:28)My Friend: I am asking you the most important question of life. Your joy or your sorrow for all eternity depends upon your answer. The question is: Are you saved? It is not a question of how good you are, nor if you are a church member, but are you saved? Are you sure you will go to Heaven when you die?  God says in order to go to Heaven, you must be born again. In John 3:7, Jesus said to Nicodemus, ‚ÄúYe must be born again.‚Äù  In the Bible God gives us the plan of how to be born again which means to be saved. His plan is simple! You can be saved today. How?  First, my friend, you must realize you are a sinner. ‚ÄúFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God‚Äù(Romans 3:23).  Because you are a sinner, you are condemned to death. ‚ÄúFor the wages [payment] of sin is death‚Äù (Romans 6:23). This includes eternal separation from God in Hell.  ‚Äú . . . it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment‚Äù (Hebrews 9:27).  But God loved you so much He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to bear your sin and die in your place. ‚Äú . . . He hath made Him ] to be sin for us . . . that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him‚Äù (2 Corinthians 5:21).  Jesus had to shed His blood and die. ‚ÄúFor the life of the flesh is in the blood‚Äù (Lev. 17:11). ‚Äú . . . without shedding of blood is no remission [pardon]‚Äù (Hebrews 9:22).  ‚Äú . . . God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us‚Äù (Romans 5:8).  Although we cannot understand how, God said my sins and your sins were laid upon Jesus and He died in our place. He became our substitute. It is true. God cannot lie.  My friend, ‚ÄúGod . . . commandeth all men everywhere to repent‚Äù (Acts 17:30). This repentance is a change of mind that agrees with God that one is a sinner, and also agrees with what Jesus did for us on the Cross.  In Acts 16:30-31, the Philippian jailer asked Paul and Silas: ‚Äú . . . ‚ÄòSirs, what must I do to be saved?‚Äô And they said, ‚ÄòBelieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved . . . .‚Äô ‚Äù  Simply believe on Him as the one who bore your sin, died in your place, was buried, and whom God resurrected. His resurrection powerfully assures that the believer can claim everlasting life when Jesus is received as Savior.  ‚ÄúBut as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name‚Äù (John 1:12).  ‚ÄúFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.‚Äù (Romans 10:13).  Whosoever includes you. Shall be saved means not maybe, nor can, but shall be saved.  Surely, you realize you are a sinner. Right now, wherever you are, repenting, lift your heart to God in prayer.  In Luke 18:13, the sinner prayed: ‚ÄúGod be merciful to me a sinner.‚Äù Just pray: ‚ÄúOh God, I know I am a sinner. I believe Jesus was my substitute when He died on the Cross. I believe His shed blood, death, burial, and resurrection were for me. I now receive Him as my Savior. I thank You for the forgiveness of my sins, the gift of salvation and everlasting life, because of Your merciful grace. Amen.‚Äù  Just take God at His word and claim His salvation by faith. Believe, and you will be saved. No church, no lodge, no good works can save you. Remember, God does the saving. All of it!  God‚Äôs simple plan of salvation is: You are a sinner. Therefore, unless you believe on Jesus Who died in your place, you will spend eternity in Hell. If you believe on Him as your crucified, buried, and risen Savior, you receive forgiveness for all of your sins and His gift of eternal salvation by faith.  You say, ‚ÄúSurely, it cannot be that simple.‚Äù Yes, that simple! It is scriptural. It is God‚Äôs plan. My friend, believe on Jesus and receive Him as Savior today.  If His plan is not perfectly clear, read this tract over and over, without laying it down, until you understand it.Your soul is worth more than all the world.  ‚ÄúFor what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?‚Äù (Mark 8:36).  Be sure you are saved. If you lose your soul, you miss Heaven and lose all. Please! Let God save you this very moment.  God‚Äôs power will save you, keep you saved, and enable you to live a victorious Christian life. ‚ÄúThere hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it‚Äù(1 Corinthians 10:13).",2,0,Emmanuel Torres Davila,hNCmb-4oXJA,0.20053383036716366,2018-12-26 16:26:09,True,True

(Zephaniah 2:3).  ***(Seek The Lord): This is the language of true (REPENTANCE), renewal, and regeneration.  ***(You will be hidden): Zephaniah used a play on words with meaning of his own name, ""Hidden in the Lord."" Even in the midst of the most calamitous judgment scenes, the mercy and grace of the Lord is still available to a (REPENTANT) people.  ***(Luke 13:3)<---Jesus)<---I tell you, Nay: but, except ye (REPENT), ye shall all likewise perish.  ***(Luke 5:32)<---(Jesus)<---I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to (REPENTANCE).  ***(2 Peter 3:9)<---The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to (REPENTANCE).  ***(Romans 2:4)<---Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you to (REPENTANCE?)  *** (REPENTANCE):  (Greek. Metanoia); Strong's #3341; This Greek word is a compound word derived from meta, meaning ""after"" and suggesting some type of change, and nous, meaning ""mind.""   Thus the word strictly denotes ""a change of mind.""  But it also connotes remorse for sin, accompanied by a desire to turn away from one's sin, to God, for salvation.  Both John the Baptist and Jesus began their ministries with a call to repentance. (See Matthew 3:2, 4:17)---A call that many of the social outcasts and ""sinners"" of that day answered, (See Luke 19:1-10),  but that the religious people rejected. (Luke 11:39-44; 18:9-14).",0,0,mlzanercik,hNCmb-4oXJA,0.043750000000000004,2018-12-26 16:28:00,True,True

Over decades of her life she tries to forget or bury this horrifying truth, only for it to resurface and threaten not only her this time, but her whole family. After the realization of what‚Äôs actually happening, she tells her daughter in a terrified voice to put her shoes on. After they all meet face to face the mother must explain to the family they must kill these clones or they will kill them. They must take steps back to the source of the the mothers childhood to end this horror all while facing their greatest enemies...

2018-12-26T22:05:17,"""This is a Channel 7 news brief because the news is happening now!   Good evening Mort Perkins reporting. Our top story tonight: Police and   investigators are still trying to figure out how and why somebody stole four dead bodies from the   Wayne County morgue late Monday night. Police say the apparent body thief entered   through the basement window but how they eluded the security and alarm system is still a   mystery. But what we at Channel 7 are wondering: What kinda sick FUCK would steal four   dead bodies anyway? Details at 11.""   Dead bodies, dead bodies all over the street.   55-65, bodies at least.   I hang with the stiffs till the break of dawn.   I'm always finding bodies when I'm mowing the lawn.   Drag 'em in the house, throw 'em in the oven.   Wicked clown lovin' that dead body grubbin'.   Tastes like chicken, finger lickin' deep fried.   I ate a dead body, but don't tell. I lied.   I just ate my first dead body last week,   Still got the fingernail caught in my teeth.   Before ya start yellin' and cursin' my name,   Remember somethings wrong with my brain, insane.   Second I was born, doctor threw me against the wall.   Kicked open the doors and he whipped me down the hall.   I'm sliding and I'm boucin' off shit like a hockey puck.   And my mother's like, ""What the fuck?!""   He said I was born of an alien race.   Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face.   But I'm not a martian, you wouldn't understand.   I'm just a dead body man.  ""We've got bodies! Dead bodies! We got fat ones, skinny ones, males, females,   hermaphrodites! We got somebodies! We got nobodies! Bodies, bodies, bodies!   WOO!""  Dead bodies, dead bodies in the back of my van.   All the little kiddies love the dead body man.   I drive through my neighborhood ringin' my bell.   Some people run cause they don't like the smell.   Others line up just as quick as they can.   To try to catch a glimpse of the dead body man.   It's all good, if you can stand the funk. but uh.....   Just don't look in the trunk.   I drive down central kickin' the bass.   Chillin' with my freaks and I'm pickin' her face.   Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head.   Cause my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead.   I'm a hoe you can't trust, always diggin' a nut.   A dead body bitch learned to keep her mouth shut.   Riding in the back is my dead body crew.   Only they can never think of nothin' to do.   If you think I'm sick, take a look at yourself.   You got dead deer heads up on your shelf.   On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand.   I'm just the dead body man.  ""We also collect dead bodies! So if you know any dead people,   or you yourself are planning on dying soon,   we'll be happy to come to your house and pay cash for it!  We appreciate good, healthy, stiffs for our dinner! WAHOO!""  Call me the dead body man (Some'll give 'em to me!)   Call me the dead body man (Just sell 'em to me!)   Call me the dead body man (You can mail 'em to me!)

Another thing is that there is a reoccurrence of the same place: the room with there are rabbits in cages (2:21)is also where the mother and the clone face off(2:04), which could mean that it could be the place where the cloning began. Also at (2:24) it looks like the mother is screaming because she just had to kill her clone.

Even the scissors are symmetrical, scissors are just two blades with handles kept together by one joint or screw.  3) The white rabbits are likely an allusion to some of the earliest tests of genetic cloning. Perhaps the black people seen in the same hallway are parallels to the white rabbits.  4) This movie is definitely about having multiple identities or personalities or even different ideas of a person in your mind than what is perceived. There can be a different you that someone knows that is nothing like the you that they know or that you even know.

I assume from my personal experience from a black family is that because at a young age black parents don't want their children learning such things in a way to protect them from such dark horrors of the real world until it's too late when they really needed it the most. (i have more to say on this topic but have no idea how to put the rest into words)  3. When the dad confronts the family members in the driveway and says if we're going to be crazy we can get crazy the two siblings or demons immediately teleported out of the scene to go around the house is that just a cut scene or are they going to actually slowly walk away while thr ""Father"" walks toward the father or are they going to be teleporting around the movie?  Theory: what if the.beginning is the clones and they managed to kill the entire family except for the little boy but the son doesn't realize it, and the rest of the ""family"" is trying to learn to act like a normal ""black"" family while they drive down a long road as the song i got 5 on it slowly fades away just as the car does in the sun set",0,0,Garnet,hNCmb-4oXJA,-0.05621980676328503,2018-12-27 00:02:47,True,True

The whole point that it wasn't sold as such.now similar to this movie here it's very different I really can't explain what this movie is about and that's what's gonna make it interesting.

Also notice how the figures are all white here. The unconscious/dead bodies behind them could more than likely be the original persons. Yet the bright red jumpsuit, leather fingerless glove, and oddly shaped scissors still are there. Maybe the protagonist family aren't the only ones with doppelg√§ngers?  2:08 white lady's got a glove and scissors and more than likely one of those red jumpsuits. Chances are, this too is a clone who kills the white  lady with our protagonists shown on the beach.  Another thing is that Jordan Peele said there would be NO racial undertones about this movie, so I wouldn't go so far as to say that the white friends of the family are the antagonists. After all, the deeper meaning of this film, as stated in the trailer, is ""We are our own worst enemies.""  2:24 we have a shot of Adelaide (Nyong'o's character) in a classroom-type setting with her doppelg√§nger, and there's one long drawing of stick figures holding hands behind the doppelg√§nger. This could mean that the doppelg√§nger is trying to explain that it's not just them who have clones, but way more than them. This could be justified by the white lady seen with scissors, the glove, and the jumpsuit just some seconds earlier in the trailer and before THAT, the white lady friend crawling on the ground, appearing to be dying. Additionally, Adelaide's doppelg√§nger is holding the scissors and also two figures of people who are initially holding hands, only for the double to pull them away, possibly showing and symbolizing that the doubles want to separate their respective persons and take over their lives, or something to that effect.",0,0,Spencer Cowan,hNCmb-4oXJA,0.034606481481481495,2018-12-27 00:38:39,True,True

2018-12-27T01:21:54,"Whatever is going on in this trailer, it appears to be some kind of city-wide panic. In numerous shots, the backgrounds are littered with bodies, and the ""good"" family are moving around the central beach town being chased by their clones. Considering that we never blatantly see anyone else's clone except for the family's, we could maybe say that it's them that committed what appears to be a mass murder, but in 0:44 you can see the bloody white man on the beach is wearing a red jumpsuit under his cloak(the same jumpsuit the family is wearing) so that probably means it is some kind of mass attack of doppelgangers (I think the reason he is on the beach, just standing there is because he has already killed his ""original"" hence his being bloody, and now does not know what to do. This would also explain why you never see the family being attacked by anyone else's doppelganger, and even the family's appear to be attacking only the member they are clones of). My theory is that the entire ""good"" family are clones and the ""bad"" family are their originals, and all the people in this mysteriously secluded beach town are clones. Their original, evil selves are attacking the town after escaping from the place they were held at. There is however the possibility of something deeper than just cloning, like an alternate universe, as their is no way for the ""evil"" masked little boy clone to know his ""good"" counterpart is also wearing a mask, which is what he shows up to the house in. The lightning storm we are shown at 1:01 could be how they get into our dimension.  The rabbits signify cloning, as they are frequently cloned in the name of science. This may be some kind of experiment run by the community in ""Get Out,"" it could be them cloning the same evil person and then stealing their body, making them good, wiping out their own memories, and then being attacked by the mind-broken original person, but the fact that their are several white people dead on the streets, as well as a white woman being attacked at 1:59 discredits this, but if you pause the video at 2:08 you see her doppelganger wearing a red top, and it also appears to be in the same scene where she's being attacked, meaning it is most likely a mass attack of clones. Another thing I noticed, the daughter is wearing a rabbit shirt, if you pause the clip at 0:36 you'll see that.",189,14,Rocky Walter,hNCmb-4oXJA,0.044687499999999984,2018-12-27 01:21:54,True,True

That is how you make it with Black people, without making it about them being Black.  I appreciated Get Out, for how it exploited that weakness in Black characters in Film and in American Life period, but although it was necessary to create that film, this one seems to be allowing the characters to exist without including a foil based on Racial points.  They are a Black Family and encounter a Horrific plot that should be enjoyable and suspenseful whether or not it was a family of a different race.  Usually Black Horror Films have to rely on the same traits as any Predominantly Black Film, and its worst trait is Over Blackifying every element of an otherwise traditional story and sometimes worse create a Homebrew Blackified Plot Device that wouldn't be used in any other instance because it doesn't make sense.  Like Soul Plane.

2018-12-27T01:52:59,"the first half of the trailer in 1:21 I was rolling my eyes thinking it was another horror movie of a crazy white people murdering an innocent black family rehash. But it's THEM the black family causing the murders in 2:00. I'm putting a theory up is about a black family trying to conform to white society and the clones are the manifestation of the family. a warp twisted version of themselves they projected and the black family finally snapped and begins murdering people hence why they are dressed in jumpsuits. they could have escaped from an asylum and developed a second consciousness:¬†from a nice clean cut suburban family to a deeply disturbing psychological mindset the family tries burying over the years. I think the movie centers about the ""Double Consciousness"" theory. back in Lupita Nyong'o character, she was teaching Jason about the rhythm of the beat of the rap music than the scene intercuts with the father driving a speedboat, which is usually an affluent white person's recreational hobby, and talking to Elizabeth Moss character who is a typical white valley girl ""vodka o' clock"" stereotype. the family acts black around themselves but with other people, they will try for the most part act white. Trying to conform to WASP expectation that drives the family insane and end up going on a murderous rampage! btw that little girl is probably Lupita's Nyongo's flashback of herself.",1,2,Kristina Guerrero,hNCmb-4oXJA,-0.03825757575757575,2018-12-27 01:52:59,True,True

They refer to cutting a life thread, but they also represent the union of spiritual and physical.  Then we have the rabbits : Rabbits are also a symbol of fertility, family and new life. ... Symbolic rabbit meanings deal primarily with abundance, comfort, and vulnerability. Traditionally, rabbits are associated with fertility, sentiment, desire, and procreation.  We also have the color red in the outfits of the  Doubleganger family  That looks a lot like the outfit in the handmaid's tale  An interesting Lee in love he has Elisabeth moss and the cast.  That outfit is a symbol of oppression and that that dystopia.   Maybe it symbolizes what the trailer says how we are our own worst enemies and hold ourself back and oppress ourselves even more. Even the song he chose. I don't know I'm super intrigued by this movie I love that is a black family in the front and I think it's gonna be a social commentary on the mental issues that we are having nowadays so potently.  I can't wait to see it I personally will now see a second trailer because I wanna watch the movie with the little info that I have right now and that's it.

When the ‚Äútethered‚Äù family comes in the house, he is calm and is like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Us‚Äù. Why is he so unbothered? Everyone is scared but him!  He is also seen in a shot with his ‚Äútethered‚Äù self getting close, again unbothered AF. It is reminding of the Sixth sense for some reason. Don‚Äôt let me find out this little boy is a mass murderer/sociopath.  What if he is the killer and has split personalities and these are visions in his mind to dissociate what he does?

2018-12-27T06:17:23,"This looks like it's about how we are our own worst enemies. We are constantly battling that part of ourselves that self destructs. That part of ourselves that says the worst and the cruellest things that no one else ever would. Each day we battle with it and each day one side wins. Which side kills the other for today? Am I going to be my true self today or am I going to be my self-loathing self-destructive self today?   Edit:  I just wanted to add that I read that Jordan Peele said that racism isn't the focus of this film (although I'm sure it's a part of it) but that being our worst enemies is. For instance I noticed that Lupita's Doppelganger has natural afro-american short hair, no makeup and a bit of an accent. It seems almost like her ""worst enemy"" is largely her culture and natural self. In the trailer Lupita's character is sort of out of place from the beginning. In the car ride she is moving off beat to the song almost like it's saying that she's not in sync with herself. The way she's sitting in the car feels out of place and kind of uncomfortable too, like she's just not comfortable in her own skin. That's the feeling I got the whole time watching the trailer. Then her Doppelganger is so stark in contrast to her that it just feels like she's repressing parts of herself and is anglo-americanizing/white washing herself. Also, her Doppelganger's face kind of looks like a puppet. Sort of like black face. The way whites represented blacks in media as empty shells that were just the whites' stereotypical versions of them. Lupita's Doppelganger even has the 'black face slave voice'. Then the boy is wearing a literal mask on his head for most of the movie and his Doppelganger is wearing a creepy mask over himself in the whole trailer. Which makes me think that the boy is wearing a symbolic mask throughout his life. He's not showing his true self and he's hiding behind his mask to protect himself. Plus, the boy's mask is literally a monkey/ape. Just more racist symbolism.Later in the trailer we see his Doppelganger without his mask and his mouth has scars from being burnt. To me that's saying that the boy feels like his voice is not heard. That he is either unworthy of being listened to or that what he says makes him unworthy. I cant tell which until I see the movie. It probably showed up after some kind of childhood trauma. Similarly if the Doppelganger's mouth is not burnt closed, it could also mean that he was emotionally scarred and that caused him to retreat into his mask. So to me it seems that the Doppelgangers are initially their enemies, their self-loathing self-destructors... but they're also confronting them with the reality of what they've disconnected from themselves. Lupita's Doppelganger that symbolizes the whites' black face/puppet version of afro-americans is confronting Lupita with the fact that she is now doing this to herself to feel more worthy. She is anglo-americanizing herself. The Doppelgangers are confronting them with what they're suppressing most, and what they're hiding about themselves that they ultimately HATE MOST about themselves. Which is in turn what the Doppelgangers are. So not only are the Doppelgangers that inner part of themselves that hate themselves the most, but they are also WHAT they hate the most about themselves. That's the symbolism of the scissors in my opinion. They are literally cutting out aspects of themselves that they deem to be unworthy.",59,3,shirinf333,hNCmb-4oXJA,-0.02579761904761905,2018-12-27 06:17:23,True,True

2018-12-27T09:13:36,My theory... the Rorschach parts of the trailer are no accident.  In fact it‚Äôs very telling.  I think that it‚Äôs going to be how people view African American culture vs. Anglo American culture.  It‚Äôs another Jordan peele film so I believe race is a big part of it yet again.   I believe it‚Äôs going to be the African American parts of their personalities that are going to be going against the parts of them that are assimilating to  Anglo culture.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coincidental that they used actors and actresses with a darker skin tone...That‚Äôs why I think the child doppelg√§nger has a white face... because he would be the most susceptible being the furthest away from African American culture.  It was emphasized with Lupita having to teach him how to find the beat of ‚ÄòI got five on it‚Äô ...it‚Äôs also shown when they‚Äôre  walking on the beach with their shadows juxtaposed to their bodies... it‚Äôs brilliant cinematography and incredible storytelling.

You know, some people followed Jesus for the miracles He performed and to get their needs met (John 6 : 2, 26). Some simply saw Him as the carpenter‚Äôs son (Matthew 13 : 55‚Äì58), and others expected Him to be their political leader (Luke 19 : 37‚Äì38). Some thought of Him as a great teacher (Matthew 7 : 28‚Äì29), while others quit following Him because His teaching was hard to understand (John 6 : 66).   Jesus still doesn‚Äôt always meet our expectations of Him. Yet He is so much more than we can imagine. He‚Äôs the provider of eternal life (vv. 47‚Äì48). He is good and wise; and He loves, forgives, stays close, and brings us comfort. May we find rest in Jesus as He is and keep following Him. Begin your journey with our Creator THIS VERY MOMENT by first understanding that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Abba Elohim (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit!                                                       Thank You, Jesus, that You are the kind of Savior we need. Wrap us in Your love and bring us confident rest in You. This we pray in Your Mighty name Yeshua, Amen!

I think the director got a lot of praise from his previous film and now his fanbase is overhyping the next film a bit too much.  I think many of you are doing yourself a disservice by putting too much faith and hope into this film being great.   You're setting up Peele to by a new version of M. Night Shyamalan just after releasing the massive hit The Sixth Sense.  M. Night went downhill after peaking on his first film.    I'm also getting the vibe that most of the praise and hype is coming from very young people, especially young American blacks desperate for films featuring mostly black casts and film makers.

2018-12-27T19:40:02,"Things of significance in this trailer: Mask Bunny Beach Scissors The mask could represent different personalities, hiding the truth, covering something up. Bunnies, as many people have said cloning. And what they typically use bunnies for it testing, it seemed the duplicates all had some kind of healed injury so maybe these families were cloned (willingly or not?) and the duplicates escaped and are seeking revenge because they had to be subjected to a life of torture while the originals got to live in bliss (beach house, boat, happy family). The beach..... I guess that could be new beginnings, tides wash away the sand kind of deal. I don't know what else the beach could represent.  Scissors. All of them had scissors and they seemed to be the only thing they were really using to attack. But I'm not sure what they could represent, if anything, but I feel like Jordan Peele wouldn't put something like that and have it NOT have meaning. Apparently Peele said this was going to be a new horror movie ""villain"", so cloning and evil twins or doppelgangers seems a bit on the nose. BUT, it seems that directors have very little say in what's shown in trailers, so this might have given away more than he wanted it to.",581,42,Savannah,hNCmb-4oXJA,0.11021613190730838,2018-12-27 19:40:02,True,True

Also adding this later I think I have figured out the order of events (important to figuring trailers out cause they are just jumbled from random points in the film) but the little black girl is Lupita‚Äôs character when she is young, this is either during a nightmare sequence or flash back (possibly flash back cause of that one shot of the evil little girl in the crowd of what look like people dressed for the 70‚Äôs/80‚Äôs wandering through what looks like some kind of facility) the beach and scenes leading up to the house are the middle and the scenes of them running through the town full of dead people are toward the end.   So plot flow is probably she discovered the things and where they come from as a young girl but the trauma of almost being killed by her clone makes her blot it out. Coming back to her childhood beach front town the clone (now full grown) has made imperfect copies of her family based on how Lupita‚Äôs character pictures them mentally (the father with his eyes closed or sewn shut possibly symbolizing negligence?) which cascades into a large scale assault on the town as it is revealed she has cloned everyone in town.

Evidence of this is in the synopsis itself when it says ""unexplained and unresolved traumas of her past"" which again alludes to the possibility that Lupita's character has encountered these clones before and knows a lot about them. Furthermore, the little girl around 1:40 was not seen with the family in the beginning of the trailer so that could be either a lost child hence the ""I've got FIVE on it"" song being played or Lupita's character when she was much younger encountering the clone for the first time.

2018-12-28T02:37:51,"Okay, I've seen everyone's ideas, and I'm gonna try to mold mine together based off of them. I think the scissors represent the negative alter egos (other family) trying to cut off the cultural appropriation of the ""normal"" family. They seem like the type of family that surrounds themselves around Caucasians to increase their social status, when in reality their only cutting away from their African roots. I think the other family is trying to like, idk cut off that ""whiteness"" within the normal family, making them truly black again.  Or this could be a low-key statement of how the real part of African Americans try to cut off all of the stereotypes and expectations set by white America. Thus, being the reason why the normal family hangs out with the white people.  Another theory I have is that the other family is the future. Like, if the normal family continued disregarding their roots. Because like another commenter said, the little boy has a whit face. I interpret this as the kid is the furthest away from his culture, thus being seen as ""white"" (also this ties into the stigma of if a black kid is raised well, he's seen white as his peers because he has adaquat home training) The daughter has straight hair, and this reminds me of the black girl that went on Dr.Phil  and said she was white. So this is what I mean by the normals will become the family with scissor hands. The mom does a and movement when she taps her face, and that's a sign of poshness (or so I've heard) Now the dad, I'm not too sure of, and I'd love for the movie to go further into him.  Longest story short, I think the ""killer"" family is trying to stop their past selves from turning into literal monsters, by cutting out the socializing and trying to be white. EDIT------ I found out the other family members are called the tethered, which further proves what I was saying about them being a tether to their roots Also, I believe I said that the other family are counterparts, but I'll say it again now. The mother never smiles, but the tethered version is always happy to the point it's weird. The real dad is always cracking dad jokes n stuff, but the tethered is serious. The daughter cares about her image, the tethered one DOESN'T EVEN HAVE EYEBROWS!!! And the son talks too much, the other one doesn't speak at all. The scissors are like a thing to connect the both of them (the tethered and the real family) as one. That way they'll be a better person, because they're not a good people without their flaws, of which they've CUT off of themselves",78,14,Sub-Urban Stonehead,hNCmb-4oXJA,-0.0034939236111111035,2018-12-28 02:37:51,True,True

Its always okay for white people to make films with cast 90% 100% white... theres alot of latinos in this country but you rarley see them in films.. unless  they pass for white. Whats the excuse for that ? Even though im black I didnt complain when I watched ""Crazy Rich Asian"" because theres only Asians with a Asian director or ""On My Block"" because majorty of the cast is Latinos and the director is Latino... I watched and supported them because I am very happy and proud to see people of color making their way into the industry that dosent execpt them.. but now people are here complaning about how people don't include White people when these directors are just trying to get more people of color out there, so that underrepresented  people can see people of their own race on film... and the only way they could do it unfortunately is by making their own god dam films! Well ofcurse it will be prodomantly Black or Asian or Latino... dumb asses. And can someone tell me why they think our race percentage is a good reason as to why people of color shouldn't be making films... or why America dosent need to diversify the films ??  Native Americans are only 2% of the population sadly üòë, but they wanted to see themselves in film so they made their own... why tf does it matter ??? Why are you calling people racist for wanting to have representation ?? I really dont get it üòë. I would understand why people would say this if it was for the fact that white people are seen in films more then others actually because theres alot more white people in this country, rather then the reality of the situation wich is that alot of casting directors only ask for White actors, rather then being fair..... and still if it was only due to there being more White people in this country there would still be alot more Black, Asian, Latino etc in films then the small amount we see right now... so it clearley isint the case. You even got Latino, Native American, Asian, Black Characters being played by white people, thats how bad this shit is. ( And if they decided to change a orginally white character into a different race, wtf does it matter when you already make all your actors and characters White, yall should be happy there giving other people a chance. And yes when there is a orginally Black, Asian, Latino Character and you make them White it isnt fair because you guys already take up all the fucking roles in the first place ! The only chance that should have been given was taken away... Ofcurse the narrative would be different then changing a white character into a person of color.)   And just to be clear with the dumb asses in this comment section ""Get out"" was more then a horror movie, it also shedded light to the things black people went through and still go through in America... if you feel like it was painting a bad narrative on White people then it goes to show you the extremely bad things some white people have done and are doing to Black people... its so bad that you got offend by it.. lol. Even though there was alot of fiction to the movie their was alot of truth behind the story as well.. im not sitting here saying white people got magical powers and shit and are trapping black people into a sunken place and shit lol ofcurse not, but im just saying that you should look at the message between the story first before you jump to conclusions. Their was a message behind the goddam story it wasn't just made to say "" all white people are evil and are attacking us boohoo""... come one idiots.  There's alot of issues black people wanna shed light on and he decided to shed light on it in a way that everyone would get their asses up to see it wether you like the message or not.... and obviously it worked out because he got alot of reaction.. I mean usally when black people or other people of color complain about their struggles or try to spred diversty raracist people make it about themselves and how everyone is attacking them and how they feel excluded... when their actually doing the attacking, and the excluding, but whatever lol. Only racist people who choose to ignore the struggles that people of color face... call that movie racist.  Most white people I know who aren't enjoyed it.. and didn't have some dumb shit to say, but their alot less ignorant to the struggles black people and other people of color face in this country and are not trying to cover shit up because they feel that "" People of color complain to much ""... if we let that type of dumb comment get to us we would have still been sitting at the back of the bus etc...",5,0,sarah bibins,hNCmb-4oXJA,0.03357780612244894,2018-12-28 03:21:24,True,True

2018-12-28T16:05:54,"I noticed that the bodies laying on the beach and in the street are all of different races and Elizabeth Moss‚Äô character seems to have a double as well as we see her wearing the red outfit, one glove on her right hand and holding a pair of scissors. I think everyone in the movie has a ‚ÄúTethered‚Äù version of themselves, meaning we ALL have another side and we ALL can be our own worst enemies. The Tethered may be the cloned versions of the original people, or the family we see may be the clones. Or they could just be their deepest darkest feelings and emotions that have manifested into a person that now wants to destroy them so they can act out these negative feelings & emotions instead of hiding them like the original family maybe has. Either way the Tethered are their direct opposites as the mom seems to be more serious and structured while her Tethered version runs down the hall with scissors which when a person partakes in is said ‚Äúto willfully act in a reckless, foolish, and/or dangerous manner‚Äù. Tethered means to be tied so I think the purpose of the scissors is to untether or untie themselves from the family we see so there is no more ties and instead of two versions there will only be one in the end and the Tethered want to be the surviving ones. The rabbits made me think cloning but also made me think of Alice in Wonderland like going down the rabbit hole which is defined as ‚Äúused to refer to a bizarre, confusing, or nonsensical situation or environment, typically one from which it is difficult to extricate oneself.‚Äù So perhaps the ride saying ‚ÄúFind Yourself‚Äù with the mirrors inside is actually a ‚Äúrabbit hole‚Äù that leads to the hallway/mental hospital and the Tethered or ‚Äúrabbits‚Äù dwell there but have escaped. In the scene with the little girl in that hallway, she & the people behind her look like they were all on the beach and all went on that ride or a ride down the rabbit hole to where their true selfs are.",16,2,Sincerely Amanda,hNCmb-4oXJA,-0.05423044217687075,2018-12-28 16:05:54,True,True

2018-12-28T22:31:25,"The part where the dad says: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt do drugs!‚Äô (0:19) is probably a way of foreshadowing the rest of the story. My theory is that the alternate version of the family (the ones with scissors) is the f***ed up version that would‚Äôve happened if they did do drugs. They want to kill the other family because they are scared about what would‚Äôve happened if they did do drugs. The dad is particularly concerned, unlike his son. This shows that the boy hearing his dad say: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt do drugs!‚Äô makes him imagine how he would look if didn‚Äôt respect his dad‚Äôs opinion about drugs, but he isn‚Äôt scared of it since his clone ressembles him emotionally and thoughtfully. So basically, I am saying that the son of the real family will kill his dad and then ask for a bunny to his mother. The mother will say no, kill her and his sister, and then take a bunny from the bunny place in the trailer, indicating that he was part of the bad guys all along.

Time to stop paying taxes, scrap our government and return to the gold standard (which the Rothschilds have stolen and bunkered away).

Every war ever fought was to put a central bank in that country that is funded by the IMF putting everyone into eternal debt. We are awake now and know we are just an enslaved species.

2018-12-29T18:26:08,"He already said that it isn't about race but I've watched this trailer so much that I've noticed some things. The youngest girl in the trailer isn't part of the family and is most likely a flashback to an earlier incident that happened to provide some type of background story. Also in the present the younger boy seems to wander off just like the little girl we see on the beach. I believe that connects. I feel like children play a big part in this story. Maybe the youngest child being the easiest to manipulate. I'm not sure. Also, the doppelg√§ngers all carry scissors as their weapons. In Jordan Peele's movie posters for the movies it says ""Join the untethering."" I assume the doppelg√§ngers want freedom from something. I am not sure what. They all also wear gloves on their right hands. Don't know what it means but I am sure that it has something to do with the bloody handprints that we see on the wall of the classroom at 2:23 and on the clothes of the people at 1:54 . Also in that same scene, the people that Lupita wants to kill are holding hands and scissors at the same time. Why does she want to kill them? There is a child in the middle of them. That's weird. Also in the classroom there are stick figures holding hands drawn on the board behind Lupita's doppelg√§nger. Why? I can't figure it out but maybe some of you guys can. I'm very intrigued on what he means by ""the untethering.""

Now, with this being a Jordan Peele movie and the mention of ‚Äúwe are our own worst enemy‚Äù I think the message is that the evil family is the past ‚Äúhood‚Äù version of themselves that is still inside them & can‚Äôt just let them be happy so it fucks things up (tries to ‚Äòkill‚Äô their new life). Now of course this is due to previous trauma and a difficulty to accept they are worthy of this new life. In the black community this survivor‚Äôs guilt‚Äô from those who got out of the hood is often exacerbated by jealousy and tearing apart from those who are still there (name-calling such as uncle tom, sell-out, etc)",3,0,Pontiax Trust,hNCmb-4oXJA,-0.04827441077441078,2018-12-30 07:58:00,True,True

2018-12-31T09:39:42,"My theory is this, the ""Clone"" family is actually their own ""Demons"" coming to hunt them...   Why do I say that ? Because in the middle of the trailer the words ""WE ARE OUR OWN WORST ENEMY"" Appears on screen...    So I believe it's a play on mental health therefore the movie will show us the ""Regular"" Family fight through their own ""Demons"" & insecurites...    Furthermore in my own analysis of the first half of the trailer before their own ""Demons"" come into play to hunt them, I noticed that Lupitas character seems to have some traits of Schizophrenia, Paranoia & Anxiety. What lead me to believe this was in the scene where she was sitting on the beach, analyze her body language right before she gets up to run & search for the child. She seemed very anxious & isolated from the conversation she was having with the other 2 individuals. It's as if in her mind she's already coming up with all the possible negative things that could be happening to the child. Plus she was the only one who cried when the alternative family came in. I also noticed that her alternative self said ""Becarful"" Then proceeded to laugh, as if her alternative self was mocking the thoughts her ""Original"" Self has in her mind...   I could keep going on with my theory for the other characters but I'll leave it at that...  I'll just say I think the adult male puts up a front of being a tough guy,  but he's really not built like that & his own ""Demon"" is going to expose that vulnerability plus more throughout  the movie...   The rabbits üê∞though, there is something symbolic with the rabbits. Y'all ever heard the saying ""Madder Than A March Here"" ?

2019-01-01T02:52:07,"Ok I gotta theory. It's based on a comment I saw earlier, but I added some stuff on. I belive this takes place in the same universe as get  out. From the looks, it looks like the events this movie take place either during or much before the events in get out. My theory is that a seperate white family died in some kind of car crash/ fire, because we see lupita doppelgangers has scorched eyebrows and shorter hair, along as we see that the boys doppelganger has a burnt face. Not to mention the first scene we see in the trailer takes place in a car and a scene with a car literally in flames. Since the family died, this white family could have possibly be saved and put into the black family. And the intruders, well they are the real family awaking from the sunken place and taking back there body, hence all of the inkbloy and clues to mental illness and pshycology in general. This is why we see the ""protagonist"" run away and escape from the doppleganger intruders because the original black family is taking over again.",0,0,Madelyn Johnson,hNCmb-4oXJA,0.10885416666666664,2019-01-01 02:52:07,True,True

2019-01-02T14:17:08,"While I don't think this will definitely be what the film is about, I believe that the film explores such topics as genetic splicing and cloning. Genetic splicing refers to when the DNA of an organism is cut, and a gene from another organism is then inserted. While this is often used to make things like insulin, I feel that what Us does speak about it. In the trailer, the Wilson family goes out on vacation to get away from it all, only to have their home get invaded by intruders. What may seem to be just your average home invasion movie is suddenly dropped on its head where the strangers reveal themselves as being near spitting replicas of the Wilsons. Doppelgangers are traditionally understood to be the look-alikes of people, often with their being a supernatural reason behind it. It is always said that if you were to see your doppelganger, that would mark you for death. Famous people in history such as Abraham Lincoln reported seeing two versions of themselves in mirrors.   These doppelgangers in this case are given the name ""The Tethered."" Tethered refers to a rope or chain which is used to tie an animal to restrict its movement. In the trailer, you notice that the doppelgangers of the Wilson family move in animalistic ways such as by getting into trees to ambush the family or growling at them. In short, they act beastly. However, as many have noted, the Tethered are not perfect replicas of the Wilsons at all. One child has noticeable burn marks on his face that he hides beneath a mask. The other members of the Tethered ""family"" seem to be unable to speak except for one. While they are able to know what their counterparts would behave and the moves they would make, the problem is that they seemed to be undercooked. As if being ""restrained"" in their movements.  As for the whole idea on gene splicing, I feel that the Tethered were born from human DNA being extracted from the family members (most likely without their knowledge), and then a gene is inserted. I also kind of think that the recurring theme of scissors is a visual metaphor for genetic splicing, but I digress.  I am basing that idea off of how the synopsis of the film makes it clear that Mrs. Wilson had a traumatic experience sometime in her life. Could it be that she was experimented on by being impregnated for whatever purpose? I am aware that many are trying to automatically connect Us with Peele's Get Out, but I feel that the two are unrelated. In Us, I feel that instead of the Armitage family, you could have a secret facility trying to create perfect clones for whatever reason. While I know that Jordan Peele said that there wouldn't be any ""race"" related subject matter in the film, he does make it clear that the movies each serve as social commentary. So, it could refer to anything.   As for why I believe that the Tethered are clones, there's a moment in the trailer where Mrs. Wilson was in what appeared to be a research facility and you see numerous rabbits throughout the facility. Rabbits are known as being some of the primary guinea pigs when it comes to research. In 2002, French scientists were able to produce the first cloned rabbit using the ovum cumulus cells from a female rabbit. Also, rabbits are known for reproducing quickly, so there's that.",0,0,Robby,hNCmb-4oXJA,0.10729166666666667,2019-01-02 14:17:08,True,True

2019-01-02T21:43:49,"I believe the mom is a clone that successfully switched with her original self as a little girl. The seen on the beach with the little girl walking looked like a flash back. This could have been from the clones memory showing what she did to the ""real"" little girl, which we see something similar with the son at the beach. She's also the one that said we have to kill them before they kill us (maybe a hint at her previous experience). The cut out paper towards the end of the clip shows 2 girls further emphasizing clones. You would assume clones can't be perfect so they may not do everything identical, so when we see her snapping her fingers to the music and you can easily tell that she's off rhythm. Also they further emphasize this when they show the clones trying to talk like the original family members but obviously sound different. It's like she's been living as the real girl for so long to where it almost looks convincing but she still shows the flaws in being an imperfect clone. When she's at the beach sitting next to the people she starts moving kind of weird like she's malfunctioning or something. Someone else has a theory about schizophrenia which is interesting too. I'm curious to know if you have your own theories too. Please feel free to add to the conversation. I just heard about this movie today but it looks pretty cool so far.

And does anyone notice all the stuff about the bunnies? At the end of the trailer there was a bunny shaped in the middle of the moms twin and you also see a bunny on the girls shirt and the bunnies in the cage. Who knows(and this is my theory so calm the fuck down people!)and the boy in the fire was just a bad dream of the mother because they said they are gonna kill them and the twins ARE killable so yeah and that‚Äôs another reason why the mom was worried.

2019-01-03T19:22:34,"I don't get why people think the red suit wearing clones are the originals when they act very psychotic and crazy, like they are having fun tormenting the original family in ways that show that they are not the real ones and just want to kill and replace them. Like, didn't we see the Tethered of Jason walk in fire then out unfazed by it and even goading Adelaide? This is biggest indication that this horror movie isn't gonna end with the cliche of ""Uh oh they were the clones all along."" And before anyone comes and say, ""But Jason's Tethered has burn scars on his face!"" I know. But I think the mask he's wearing is fire proof and to hide that his disfigurement from people when he replaces the Original Jason. Also, I will say this again, the way the trailer showed it made it seem like Adelaide tried to kill him and it showed that she is unable to kill him, meaning that Jason might have to kill him...or maybe the twist ending is that Jason will end being the fake because the mask would do well in hiding his face and putting Adelaide into a false sense of security? Either way, what I'm getting at is that Peele has even stated that those four in the red jumpsuits are called the Tethered so, it wouldn't really make sense for the Tethered of the family to be the ""real"" family. Especially with how they act...they are literally tormenting the family and playing with them before they kill them except for Gabe's Tethered who is shown to be stone-faced or angry. The exact opposite of Gabe. And with how they are introduced, you really expect me to believe that ""The ones in the jumpsuits were the real people all along"" when the doppelganger of Jason crawls on all fours, the doppelganger of Zora simply walks and is then shown fastly climbing a tree and getting in through Zora's bedroom window probably, and Adelaide's, who is the little girl meaning that they know each other, is sitting weirdly on a chair. If they were the originals why even try this creepy stuff if they wanted to get their life back, just simply kill them if that were the case.  I hope Nobody takes this as insulting, but the number of comments saying that they theorize that these red suited ones are the originals is way too much and it just doesn't work with the way that they acted and the way they torture the Wilsons. What should be questioned is ""Why are they all wearing that glove  on their right hand?"" ""Where do the Tethered come from since Adelaide encountered her's in her youth?"" ""What's the meaning behind the rabbits?"" I want see theories about that for this movie because this trailer just instantly debunks ALL the ""The clones were the originals and the family we saw are the clones"" theories because of the the Tethered's personalities and because it seems that you can only kill YOUR Tethered.",0,0,Neo Ramey,hNCmb-4oXJA,-0.08314075630252102,2019-01-03 19:22:34,True,True

And i must say this family unlike chris from Get Out speaks white. I know i must sound racist as fuck but please hear me out. Note the beginng of the trailer, how they speak and how the mum is not snapping on beat, how the Father acts on the Boat (which is called byachtch) and the scene where he tries to intimidate, the other Family with the Bat just seems so weird to me. Maybe im trippin.*    *The only eason im saying this is beacuase we learned how white people have been trying to be black and inheriting their bodies in get out.*     *Rabbits in Sciencefiction are often related to cloning. and in this Trailer we get alot of Rabbit shots. So i think the ""evil"" Family is actually the good Family, that were kidnaped, tortured ( or experimented on ) and cloned. the reason why the mum seems the most suspicious is because she is the only one who kept her memories of her old self while the rest have forgotten it but kept some of their old characteristics.*     *Well all of this wont make any sense if the movie doesn't belong to a Get Out Universe. but i still want to discusse this until the movie is released.*",1,0,Bryan Carter,hNCmb-4oXJA,-0.07355072463768116,2019-01-04 10:53:01,True,True

She realized this when she was younger (little girl with thriller shirt sending some flashback types of vibes).    Her family doesn't know that she's an self aware clone, but the bitter truth is that a secret organization within the government have been cloning people that had already *Died* in order to preserve human population.   Due to some clones becoming self aware, it slowly becomes a domino effect where now the most recent clones are coming to kill off the previous clones and to take their respective roles within society. They're also planning to end cloning once they're done with the massacre. Lupita had already died years ago, but her DNA (from being collected by the govt) was able to make a clone out of her. Now usually they will make it where the clones forget their previous memories, but we all know that mistakes can happen and sometimes technology have *errors.* Well in this case, Lupita was the aftermath of that error. The error of getting her previous memories back, which is why that beach scene of her is highly significant to the movie.

Another thing I've noticed it the way the mother holds the children when they are under attack. She holds the kids in front of her instead of behind her. What kind of mother puts her kids directly in danger? The mother is protecting the kids like they are valuable test subjects instead of her actual children.  One more theory that seems plausible is the one where the original family died a long time ago and the clones we see are another generation of failed experiments.

2019-02-09T09:34:43,"Alright.. this + the Superbowl ad's got me thinking what the symbolism is here...    It's like there's this ""Black Cloud"" hanging over us...  was a quote Lupita said in the Superbowl trailer...   The symbolism with that line when it comes to how some  Black People/Minorities feel in America sometimes.  As if their blackness will somehow hold them back in life due to the perception, and thus feel the need to try to come off as ""safer"" or less ""controversial"" or more ""tolerant"" of the way they've been treated, because they are afraid if they act themselves, that they will be perceived in some sort of negative light.        Then in the opposite spectrum, you have other people whom are considered ""not black enough"" because they portray themselves as the opposite of the ""stereotype"".  You usually hear this with someone whom is considered well educated, punctual or well-spoken.  This is essentially those people's way of saying that if you are ""Black"" you are not allowed to be these things or you're abnormal, and if you are it's seen as an attribute unexpected of you due to your ""blackness"".       How often do you see a Black Athlete where the news media will always say in terms of an attribute, or benefit ""He's softspoken."" or ""he's well-spoken"" as if it's a credit for them but you never hear that given to a white athlete as a 'benefit'.  Because the black athlete isn't ""expected"" to speak ""properly"".    It's actually an insult that someone goes ""wow you're so well-spoken."" as if that's a + rather than the expectation.     That ""Black Cloud"" has so many meanings, particularly in shaping how the ""minority in america"" is 'supposed' to act, and how some feel they're 'forced' to act, just to 'fit into it'.  A layer that society makes you feel you have to ""cut away(scissors symbolism)"" in order to make it, or be perceived as 'not a threat.'.   Look at how Lupita's hair is the extension dreads, while her 'doppelganger is much more akin to wearing it natural and closer to her roots.   The duality between the 'clones' and the main characters, seems to be something the movie will hit home on.      It's as if it's saying that some black people grow up feeling like if they are going to fit into society and be perceived as not a threat, that they have to 'sever' whatever the perception of 'black' is away from themselves.   It's sad, how true that is in some cases.   That mentality, of stripping away that side of yourself in order to fit in, captures the duality between these clones and the family.  And it hits home how further and further, with each passing year, so many black people or other minorities, stray away from their roots in order to attempt to 'blend' into a society that didn't have to shed theirs for their benefit.     The biggest nightmare, is feeling you need to run away from yourself, in order to be *allowed* to flourish...     So then the question becomes...are the family we spend time with most of the movie really themselves...or are *they* the clones. Think about it.       Peele with that symbolism again, and the fact he's using a dark skinned cast to hit home this point in Hollywood makes it all the more clear, when you consider the stigma around it in Hollywood, and in general.",2,0,carrastealth,hNCmb-4oXJA,0.04313725490196079,2019-02-09 09:34:43,True,True

2019-02-24T20:34:40,"Here's my theory (inspired by other observers): This movie will take place in past and present in which the tethers origins are explained. I say past, because the mom knew of the impending danger before the imposters invaded their home (or at least I think she said that before they got in). She also freaked out about losing Jason at the beach, where kids would normally be allowed to run around alone for a bit, like she didn't want to lose Jason to their clones. Also, when Jason sees one of the tethers at the beach, it already has blood on its hands, meaning the beach takes place in the future. Furthermore, as the trailer progresses, the environment gets worse in the scenes featuring the beach, hence supporting my theory that the beach is in the future. Now here comes the part that was inspired by other viewers: the rabbits represent a duality. Rabbits are a prominent symbol in the teasers, which mean they have a HUGE meaning for the story. Rabbits may symbolize innocence, but they are also known to be the opposite. We see scenes of a lab with rabbits on the loose. In that same area, the younger daughter (clone) walks around with a crazed smile and no one seems to care. She also seems to mind her own business otherwise she would've killed anyone passing by her. The relationship with the lab and the girl indicates there's an essence of familiarity (I say familiar, because we see the lab possibly in the future, when the real mom walks in and prepares to attack anything with a bat only to see a bunch of rabbits released) and will explain the origins of the tethers. I propose the rabbits were part of a cloning experiment that went horribly wrong and now the rabbits/clones want to take over out of possibly spite/revenge. Hope you enjoyed reading this!

Jordan Peele has sold his soul to the Devil, and he is making this film in order to hypnotize people, and subliminally subconsciously program people's minds into becoming MK-ULTRA slaves to the Illuminati. This trailer was a Rorschach test, with all those ink-blots, and the bunnies were symbolic of MK-ULTRA mind control, human cloning, and sex slavery. Jordan Peele is trying to hypnotize you into sink down into The Sunken Place. This movie is an Illuminati conspiracy. Jordan Peele is a Freemason, and this movie is replete with Freemason symbolism and imagery. He is releasing this film on March 22, 2019. March is the 3rd month of the year. That's 322. 322 is the number of the Skull & Bones Society. 322 refers to Genesis 3:22 in the Holy Bible, which speaks about the fall of man upon Adam and Eve choosing to eat the forbidden fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, which is the Tree of Death. Like ""Get Out"" and so many other Hollywood movies, this is not really a movie, but an MK-ULTRA mind-control Illuminati psy-op conspiracy. Jordan Peele is conspiring to take all his viewers into The Sunken Place with this movie.

Afterall, she is the only one who gets in the facility in the trailer, and the ballerina might be lupita when she was young as well.

2019-03-20T07:15:39,"The white rabbit omen is a symbol of death. Fertility is good luck superstition based on black rabbits. The white is the opposite. The family is not real except the boy with the burnt face. They were twins where one may have died from birth or accidental death/murder. The twin or dopplerganer superstition is that one twin is good and the other is evil. The evil has to be cast aside or burned like the a white rabbit to prevent the bad omen from happening. One superstition about the rabbit comes from the vietnamese. The tshirt that one of them has on says rabbit in Vietnamese, including the boy wearing the tshirt of the rabbit. These twins represent the bad omen of the mirror of one's self. Having a mirror at the foot of the bed is bad because you'll see yourself as a gateway to one's opposite self. Why the song I Got 5 On it? There was a 4 people in the family... but the twin boy who has the burnt face is actually the 5th who was forgotten. That's all I can think of, I could be wrong tho. Cloning could be another option, but seeing the mom separate the 2 paper figures means that the twin boys were separated before. And seeing him walk through the fire without burning gives me the death separation theory that the family could've been hiding from the boy.

In 2019, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong‚Äôo) reluctantly return to Santa Cruz with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and their children Zora and Jason to visit their friends Kitty (Elisabeth Moss) and Tyler (Tim Heidecker). After Jason nearly goes into the house of mirrors, Adelaide tells Gabe what happened to her there and demands to leave. Before they can, their doppelgangers, led by Adelaide‚Äôs double Red, break into the house and hold them hostage. Adelaide, Zora and Jason escape and go to Kitty and Tyler‚Äôs house for help, but they have already been killed by their own doppelgangers. After killing them, Adelaide finds out that the entire population of Santa Cruz has been massacred by their doubles, and decides to flee with the kids to Mexico, but Red kidnaps Jason to lure Adelaide into a confrontation at the house of mirrors. Arriving there, Adelaide ventures into a facility where the doppelgangers were held, and realizes that she is the doppelganger, and took the real Adelaide‚Äôs place when they were children. Driven insane by the isolation, the real Adelaide AKA Red has rallied the doppelgangers to escape, murder their doubles and reclaim the surface world as theirs. Adelaide kills Red after a vicious fight and rescues Jason.

She specifically tells her son ""stick with me and youll be safe"" as if the kid is unaware of this situation. Also suspicious is when the supposed real dad asks the kid to get the bat for him, he is clueless and says ""what bat?"" plus the fact he looked confused when the five on it song pops up on radio, which are all obvious clues that the kid is unfamiliar with the family lifestyle.

2019-03-22T15:29:51,"SPOILER ALERT (Do not read if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet)       So here‚Äôs an explanation of what happens. When the woman was little she visited a carnival park with her parents and by accidentally wandering off she entered a little creepy room full of mirrors. There she saw a doppelg√§nger of herself, not in the mirror but in real. Now what happens after this is revealed at the end of the film. The doppelg√§nger grabbed her and pulled her into her world, which is actually underground where all the replicas (doppelg√§ngers) of all people of America live. They live here because apparently a government attempt to make clones of people went wrong so they hid them here. Then the doppelg√§nger leaves her in her place and switches places with her by wearing her clothes and entering in the outside world back to the girl‚Äôs parents. So she basically swapped places with her. Which means that‚Äôs throughout the film the woman we see is actually the doppelg√§nger who swapped places with the real one that day. And so the creepy doppelg√§nger we see in the film is actually the real girl who got swapped and trapped underground.

US‚Äôs ‚Äúbig moment‚Äù didn‚Äôt happen until maybe 20 minutes in. That‚Äôs where the direction failed. That ‚Äúbig moment‚Äù should have kicked off the movie rather than be delayed and supplemented with reflective moments of the main character‚Äôs past. The production should have been more generous to the art of horror and suspense rather than to the more moderate, passive ‚ÄúI got cha‚Äù moments found in most amateur horror films. The scenes needed to be more chilling. The evil antagonist should have been more sinister and menacing and each climax (peak) moment should have caught me off guard. The ‚ÄúGet out‚Äù movie had that feel. If I can predict what‚Äôs going to happen next in a movie, then you‚Äôve lost my interest and I start questioning myself as to why I even bothered to spend money to see the movie.

Lupita did well, even though she seemed to be forcing herself to look frightened, The daughter also was believable. But the Father was to white to be black, and the son looked as if it was his first acting job! This is the second movie from Jordan, where I give a brother the benefit of doubt ( damn ticket was 18 bucks because it was dolby!), but for me, he's in the same group as M.

2019-03-29T20:54:11,"The movie is about social class, race, and politics. Many interpretations can be drawn. The government was cloning/experimenting underground. One of the doppelgangers, Adelaide, found a way to escape, seemingly impossible because the escalator only goes down but she was able to escape and lure her human counterpart, as doppelgangers are tethered by mind and body, but not soul. This is the reason why when one act the other often do; this can be drawn from Red learning how to dance, gave birth and married in sequence, and Jason (the son) leading his doppelganger Pluto to burn in fire.  When Adelaide choked Red her vocal cords were damaged, thus the raspy voice and difficulty speaking. Adelaide, once a doppelganger couldn't speak and had to learn how to over time, thus why the parents couldn't understand why their daughter stopped talking, why Adelaide said she doesn't talk much on the beach, and when she's nervous her speech breaks. Adelaide learned to adapt in the normal world and lived a normal life; however, she always feared that Red was going to come for her, the reason she didn't want to go to the beach or was paranoid a lot. When things aligned (seen as coincident) was a sign that Red was finding ways to escape.   When Red and her family escaped, she came for revenge and to take her life back. She used the gold chained handcuffs Adelaide used to cuff her to a bed underground, then explained how miserable she was living underground and was forced to act as Adelaide did and is now coming for revenge and salvation. The movie plays out....  Analysis:   Government is experimenting or at one point experimenting. Cloning and poisoning.  A lot of 80s symbolism: Michael Jackson Thriller came out in the 80s (the thriller shirt), Hands across America (80s), Ronald Reagan's era, Nightmare on Elm street (Pluto burned skin), Friday the 13ths (the son Jason's mask), Hollween I/II (Pluto mask). Jaws: the Revenge (Gabe and Abraham fight in water, the beach, and Jason wearing the shirt). The red jumpsuit, glove, and scissors are all crossbreed of scary movies.   The children are crossbreed, both doppelgangers and human. Red is human as she was captived, eventually married and birthed children by a doppelganger. Adelaide is a doppelganger, she married and birthed children by a human. The daughter Zora showed this when she killed the twins and yelled; Jason's off the beat snapping or lack off.   The song ""I got 5 on it"" was chosen and remixed to give a feel of a scary movie like nightmare on elm street and the fact that it's a bay area classic along with F the police by NWA, as the film was produced in northern California.   Jason knew his mother Adelaide was a doppelganger when he witnessed her kill kitty and Red. Her screams were indicators.   Doppelgangers can be viewed as the poor class, Wilson's the middle class, and the Tyler's upper class. The poor are fighting to make their way up to middle class, middle classes are trying to compete with upper classes, and upper classes indulge and are oblivious to themselves and others.  Kitty Tyler was jealous of Adelaide beauty just as Gabe was envious of Josh. Noticed how they fought one another and how it happened. Kitty had an opportunity to kill Adelaide but instead cut her own face, Gabe killed Josh on the boat. Shows how women and men compete with each other.   Jeremiah 11:11 was a warning the Doppelgangers were coming to bring evil. Furthermore, the numbers are identical to represent 1 of you and one of me connected.  Gabe Wilson was depicted to be weak to illustrate how masculinity in America is dying.   Depicted racial tension in America"" we are American "" "" maybe we should move to Mexico "" black family chained and fighting for their lives.  Adelaide is empathetic towards the death of Zora and Jason's doppelganger because she knew those people are of her kind.  Zora and Jason's doppelgangers died the same way they were born.   The police cannot protect us; however, we can save ourselves. Reason why the cops never showed up and F the police song played (another reason for the song). Jason used the ambulance toy to stop the closet door from locking and they escaped in the ambulance.   Adelaide being chained throughout the movie depicts how blacks are still enslaved.",2,0,He Mad Mad,hNCmb-4oXJA,-0.050283446712018134,2019-03-29 20:54:11,False,True

First of all, the movie is not a horror movie. It's a slasher comedy that draws inspiration from zombie flicks with the main cast competing about the highest kill count. The story is very thin, the characters are caricatures and the ""big"" twist is no twist at all since everyone in the audience knows that from the very first second. Lupita's performance is amazing and the only saving grace in this film. And as a personal note, I hate ""token"" characters Americans are so crazy about. There always has to be a token black guy in every movie although the States are racially very segregated.

2019-04-01T20:49:41,"SPOILER  My interpretation on what was going on:  The government tried to control the US American people. For this they copied all citizen and had a Doppelg√§nger for everyone. The plan was that whatever the Doppelg√§ngers will do, the people on the surface will do too. But it went out to be quite the opposite (the people above controlled the people below). But what people get wrong is that the people below do NOT just copy the actions of the normal people... they adapt the purpose and the life goals of the people. Living underneath means no free chances and no life goals you might reach... so they just copy the goals of the people above and act like them. But there is a special case and that is Red and Adelaide... it is the only case where the doppelg√§nger can control the purpose of the normal person... (in a conversation original adelaide tells the fake adelaide ""you know we are a special case"")  Young Adelaide went down to the beach in the night during thunderstorm... I mean come on... no fucking kid would be even brave enough to do that... those actions were influenced by kid red.   But why and how does original Adelaide act completely independent from fake adelaide the whole movie... well thats pretty easy to answer and thats why the ""Hands across america"" thing is important.  Original Adelaide wants a revolution so she, although she lives in the underworld, has a purpose and that what makes here independent from the controls of the fake adelaide. She is the leader of the revolution and tells the others of this plan that the doppelg√§ngers first should kill their originals and then form a line starting at the beach. Now they got a meaning in their life and they act independent.  And thats what the movie is all about: free will and finding your own goals. Thats what the doppelg√§ngers want. and nobody seems to understand that from the other people above. They people above dont realize their actual privilege: free life choosing.  Hands across america is a very simple action but its all the doppelg√§ngers have in their life as a meaning and they just do it because they appreaciate their priviege now for having a free will and a meaning in their life. Something we should be thankful for. Cheers",0,0,JustWatchIt 97,hNCmb-4oXJA,0.09287918871252204,2019-04-01 20:49:41,False,True

I am beginning to believe that critics are so desperate for something original...they jump on the ""artsy,"" bandwagon as it being revolutionary..I.E...Warhol paints a freaking Campbell Soup logo yellow...and all of a sudden he's a genius? He was a HACK!  I want to know when people can simply make a great horror movie, without any political innuendos...and trust me...this one has a lot, but I want go there. Just disappointed. Watch any of these movies and save your money...and again...these are elements of this film, which simply rehashed what has already been done and done much better. 1. The Strangers (2007) Us doesn't hold a candle to the atmosphere and creepiness of this film. 2. Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) 3.

Second half was good enough.  Plot holes did come later on, but only after the end of the movie.

Is there space in that little underground cave for population of a city? And where did those rabbits came from? How those rabbits eat? How did those 'so called' shadow people shit and where? We saw the map that real girl stayed in shadow cave draw and it was a chain of people all around the world and hows that cave fit a population of the world? If there are many shadow caves all around the world how other shadow people gonna come out of the cave?( because this shadow people came out because of that one real girl was trapped inside and she was the one who guided others out ) these are some main stupid logical errors  Honesty this is not even scary without some jump scares there's nothing scary.

Our earliest records, which go back to 1646, the year of our incorporation, make mention of a ‚Äútunnel‚Äù or ‚Äúcave‚Äù that is said to be located ‚Äúunder the ground.‚Äù The words have led some to argue that our passageways were originally a single long passage, to which later ones were added by deliberate design.

So many clever twist they could pull off. You could start by showing weird habit/quirk that the evil one has. For example, a side-evil looking smile, a head-tilt habit when showing a certain emotion. Or leaning on one-leg while playing with fingers, the possibilities are endless. And for the final twist, after everyone believed it was an happy-ever after, just show the quirk.   This would have made the movie at least 10x better. I really even thought the movie was gonna be like that. As in the trailer at 1:45, they said ""They look exactly like us. They think like us."" Because this feels more like a zombie movie. It might as well be. Only the MC's ""evil twin"" could talk, while the other 3 acted like zombies.   Started out like a 9.5 for me and ended like a 4/10. The twist didn't make much sense, especially with the last scene when the son was looking at her like that.

All the ideas introduced by the symbolism felt wrapped up poorly and the world created felt like it made unnecessary rules and broke them left and right. The plot felt scattered, I couldn‚Äôt figure out if it was a movie about escape, horror, fighting back, or discovering the under world. Idk it just felt way scattered and didn‚Äôt live up to the hype I surrounded it in. The twist was predictable and I didn‚Äôt get the same gut wrenching feeling that I got from get out.

And Get Out .. <i>won an Oscar.</i>    And now this POS movie ... it's dumb, pointless, silly, and pretends to have a big twist at the end ... that makes <i>absolutely no sense whatsoever </i> given what has gone   before.    It's a movie about doppelgangers, but I feel like a doppelganger .. in a world full of people who think Peele is some kind of genius. Peele has now made two sub-slasher movies that make <i>no sense</i> and I can only conclude he was handed a career due to affirmative action.    If you watch this crap it will make you question the nature of reality - not in a good way like 2001 or Ex Machina .. .but in the ""What parallel universe have I landed in where this kind of shite passes for 'clever cinema'?"" kind of way.
