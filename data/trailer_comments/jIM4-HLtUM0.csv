I do see that Astrid Bergès-Frisbey is playing ""The Mage"".

Imagine someone who grew up poor and as a peasant, so he understands the hardships of the common man. When he pulls the sword from the stone, there's literally no magic involved. Nothing supernatural, he just does one thing a hundred other people before him couldn't. Now all eyes are on him and people start following him without him wanting to. It's about the power of belief, the power to choose your leaders and the concept of having greatness thrust upon you. Maybe the responsibility of thousands of lives is too great to handle, maybe he doesn't fit in with the political leaders he's forced to meet with, there's a ton of great ideas to the mythos if you take away the magic.

I hope Hunnam can move past Sons of Anarchy  because he has the makings of a movie star and the more experience he get's people will start to see it!

Ok, if you are going to make a film that has no historical accuracy in it what so ever because you can't be arsed doing the research, or want to add your own bullshit to the film, at least set it in another universe instead of a historical event.

2017-07-08T05:27:09,"Why are there black people in this movie? Arthurian legend is based in the medieval ages, near the 15/16th Century, when the only ""blacks"" that existed were Moors and even then they did not hold positions of royalty in the English court, meaning they wouldn't qualify for knighthood.  I understand this is a story, but still, like all the stories there is a definite cultural strain that comprises the Arthurian legends.. and it is based in Caucasian European/Saxon culture.  There seems to be a concerted effort to turn our histories, lore, and culture into a progeny of a false reality. Stop pretending blacks existed back then or have anything to do with British or the culture of Britannia... To lure the youth or impressionable and stupefied folk of today with CGI and ""action"", whilst subtly subverting them to the cause of Hollywood--the downfall of civilization, culture, and tradition--is not only a perversion of truth, it is immoral.   African culture and heritage is rich and beautiful. Why not portray that? What if Zulus were cast as white men? Or if Queen Sheba, said to stem from Ethiopia, was played by Emma Watson?   Wouldn't that bother you? It is historical and cultural revisionism. Streisand effect... Something you would find in Orwell's 1984, used to indoctrinate the masses..  Boycott this garbage and let us all get back to the roots of our ancestors and the stories they built, not the falsehoods perpetrated by the media, Hollywood, and those who would seek to undermine the self-determination of free peoples and cultures.",8,5,Daniel Keizer,jIM4-HLtUM0,0.05357142857142857,2017-07-08 05:27:09,False,True

When 2017 was SJW & ""progressive"" as heck, not to sound racist sry. But I liked this better than wonder woman which was man of steel but with a girl & made $900 million. Plus Dunkirk was heavily criticized that summer for having too many white men & not enough minority & women figures in a story about 400,000 English & French white soldiers stuck on a beach to get slaughtered like pigs in a barrel by nazi planes.

2018-07-16T14:23:48,"The opening sequence is truly beautiful. A well crafted world that draws you in. Music that fits the world and arouses emotion. It has really good cinematography in the parts that matter, such as where excalibur being used, the sequence with the lady of the lake, the king displaying his absolute authority, and many, many more. They managed to create a narrative that encompasses a lot of the Arthurian mythos we love while blending it with a romantic English atmosphere. The combat sequences in the latter part of the movie before the climax could have been done better, but all in all, for a 2 hour movie, it does a great job at keeping your attention. I would have liked to see Charlie Hunnam give a speech to the people, either at the beginning when he's almost executed, or at the end at his coronation, but his performance was otherwise stellar. I appreciated the cast enormously. Eric Bana, whom we know from Troy, plays Uther. I also liked the inclusion of Katie McGrath, who played Morgana in the TV series Merlin, though I wish she would have had a bigger role. It would have been good to see Merlin and a bit more of Arthur's character. I felt that they concentrated too much in that one scene where Uther dies, though I suppose that without it the movie wouldn't make too much sense. However, I wish I would have seen a bit more of who Arthur is. And more than that, where the sword came from. After all, you'd think that with a title like that, the origins of the blade would have played a bigger role. All in all, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword will surely go down as the best modern rendition of Arthurian legend.",0,0,RagingBlast2Fan,jIM4-HLtUM0,0.35670498084291186,2018-07-16 14:23:48,False,False

2020-04-09T16:58:06,"I read an article about why it flopped, it mentions multiple reasons; one of them being it was released on a Mother's Day weekend. A very inappropriate time I think. Another is that the movie took six years, six years..... went through several directors and cast. No wonder it cost so much.  Another one is no cause for female interest.  Another is that the audience targeted might have their appetite for this kind of content satisfied by Game of Thrones.  As for me, I gotte admit the trailers aren't that great either.  The comments to the article were mostly very negative though, some commentators actually watched it and didn't like it and that's fine, it's their opinions. Others didn't seem to have watched it but were just bashing on everything related to the movie, including the director Guy Ritchie, here's what one commentator said, and I quote: ""I hope the failure of this film prompts Disney to have a rethink with respect to hiring a miscast Guy Ritchie to helm the upcoming live-action Aladdin remake.  Do we really want a bare-knuckle boxing cockney Aladdin relocated to London, full of slow-mo fight scenes and only a cameo role, at best, for Princess Jasmine?""
