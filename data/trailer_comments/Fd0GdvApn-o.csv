2018-08-21T16:59:56,"We just discovered this movie on Amazon Prime video streaming. The kids love it. They have been watching it once or twice daily so far. They are a five year old boy and an eight year old girl. Either Paramount did not invest enough into marketing this to children or the adult critics are just too stupid to see this film is for kids. Now that I see the trailer, I see Nickelodeon was involved. Clearly, this movie is not for adults. The movie is solid. The cinematography is professional and beautiful. The acting from the main and supporting characters are excellent. The plot and dialogue are solid. The theme sends a responsible, environmentally-friendly message. This is a great family-friendly movie especially for families with little boys, who collect cars. I think stupid adults get caught up in seeing the same celebrities in films being recycled. If a more famous actor was involved, the adult critics would have given better reviews, which is stupid. I am glad I have never seen any of these actors before this film in anything else. I am sick of the same old, morally depraved celebrities, being hand-picked for children's movies. Normally, films aimed at children create toys for fast food chains to stick into their kids meals. When we roll through fast food restaurants' drive-thrus, the kids are more interested in the kids' meal toys than the kids' food that came with it. We rent kids' movies from Redbox. The kids learn about movies through previews before the movie plays. We have not seen any previews of Monster Trucks prior to the children's movies' playing. Adults with children are forced to take their kids to the park to keep them happy. There could have been Monster Trucks park clean-up or beautification days to create buzz for the movie. Monster Trucks could have donated and planted a tree at parks across the USA, Canada, elsewhere. The Makers Movement is increasing. There could have been a Monster Trucks Make-Your-Own toy monster truck workshop in big shopping malls for kids and how to Make-Your-Own ethanol fuel at home for adult car owners. There are lots of ways to reach families with children. When a great film don't do well, it is probably a lack of marketing or an abundance of adult stupidity among critics. Don't listen to the critics of this movie. This is an entertaining movie for kids. If you have kids, who love Blaze and the Monster Machines, Speed Racer, Transformers, or Dino-Trux, they will probably love Monster Trucks.",1,0,Raven Wright,Fd0GdvApn-o,0.1421404275996113,2018-08-21 16:59:56,False,False
