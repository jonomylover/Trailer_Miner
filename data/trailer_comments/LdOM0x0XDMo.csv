2019-12-19T18:05:55,"Kylo meets Palpatine in the first scene on the Sith planet and becomes Palpatiens student.    Secretly tho Kylo wants to team up with Rae and kill him.    Anyways, Rae and the gang go to this desert planet to find some sith dude and some artifact thing to beat the sith.  The first order knows they are there cause Kylo does some weird force thing with Rae and where they can talk to each other like VR FaceTime. Idk.  Lando Calrissian helps them evade the first order for a bit.    Big speeder bike chase through the desert ensues.  The teams kills all the storm troopers and ends up in a cave.  They find the sith ship they were looking for and dagger that has directions to the sith planet etched into it.  C3PO can decipher it though but won’t cause it’s against his programming.  They get out of the cave after Rae uses the force to heal this big snake worm.    Once they leave the cave the first order is hot on their trail.  Chewy gets captured.  Rae fights Kylo and it’s pretty cool.  Then Rae accidentally kills Chewy by blowing up the ship that Chewy is on.  Lol    Then the movie is like “SIKE!” Chewy is actually alive and captured on Kylos star destroyer.    Rae and the gang sneak onto the capital ship to save chewy but they all get captured except Rae.  Rae talks to Kylo with force FaceTime again and then Kylo comes to the ship to talk to Rae and make her come to the dark side.  He tells her that she is actually Palpatines granddaughter.    Then the team escapes.    They go to Yavin-4 to get another sith artifact from the second deathstar.  Rae goes into the death star alone and finds the artifact that would lead her to the Sith planet.  Kylo is there to though and he destroys is.  Then him and Rae fight.  Flin tries to save her but idk what he thought he was gonna do.    Rae kills Kylo when Kylo feels that his mom died via the force.  Then Rae uses that new found force healing power to save his life.  She leaves.  He sees a vision of his dad Han.  Then Kylo joins the light side of the force and throws his lightsaber into the ocean.  BIG WOW    Rae goes Luke and he gives her Red 5.  She takes that to the Sith planet to find and kill Palpatine.  While she meets him the good guys have this huge air to air battle with the new empire fleet.  They are all the old school style star destroyers but each one has a cannon that can blow up a planet.  Pretty cool.  The good guys are WAY out numbered.  Poe is leading them and right before they lose the battle Lando shows up with a metric ASS ton of space ships.    Meanwhile back with Rae and Palpatine, they fight and Kylo shows up.  The Emperor wins and uses that force healing power to steal the life from Rae and Kylo and he is back to full power like in the old movies.  Then he throws Kylo off a cliff.  The Emperor shots lighting into the sky and zaps all the good guys that are fighting the empire ships.  They start to fall from the sky and almost crash.  Almost.  All the jedi ever then talk to Rae via the force and she gets back up and kills the emperor.  She dies again.  Kylo climbs back up and force heals Rae.  She lives.  They kiss.  Kylo dies for real this time.  Good guys win.    Rae goes to Lukes house on Tatooine.  Someone asks who she is.  “Rae Skywaker”  Then she stands looking at the sunset.    Roll Cradits.

One of the first was Nicola Tesla. This is to acknowledge the fact that much of the technology they work upon and develop is indistinguishable from magic to the rest of society (White World). Some military mission patches exist with wizards as a central theme, indicating that these projects contain several actual Wizards, with the color of the wizard cloaks on the patches having hidden meanings. Today, most elite Jason Scholars working on classified projects hold this title, carrying on the tradition. In the movie “The Prestige” the Nolan Brothers (who hold the rank of Messiah), like several top Directors and Producers in Hollywood; honor Tesla with the line: ""Oh no sir, this wasn't built by a magician.

""Inception"" can dilate or slow-down time in dream states, ""Interstellar"" wraps time through space travel, and so I suspect, ""Tenet"" may deal with reversed-time or 'anti-time.'

My Christian brothers and sisters, I warn you, do not mix the Word of God with modern theologies of creation. One of the strongest delusions of this time and day is brain connectivity; or hive mind technology. This type of technology will lead you to believe that your life is nothing more than a virtual reality, a matrix, inception, avatar, or simulation, and that God has no part in your life. Not only so, but salvation, judgment, heaven, and hell are eradicated. This type of lies will cause you to doubt the existence of God. Do not give ear to this doctrines of devils. Guard your eyes from such deceptions, lest you be beguiled by the serpent. ""Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons"" (1 Timothy 4:1). Friends, be wise in the Lord, and protect your heart from people that seek to pollute your conscience with vain philosophies, and teachings. Do not give heed to them that speak to you about Aliens, reptilians, annunaki, evolutions, laws of attraction, new age propaganda, psychedelics, third eye, chakras, or meditations. Some, ""... when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things"" (Romans 1:21-23). My beloved, these type of false doctrines, will lead you to believe that you can be your own god. Friends, we live in the age of magic, sorcery, witchcraft, and satanism. And if we don't put on the armour of God, then how will we be able to defend ourselves from the wails of the devil. Therefore, ""Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:"" (1 Peter 5:9).

2019-12-20T04:20:22,"Like the internet connecting people across multiple locations in space , tenet is a framework that is planned to connect a single person across multiple instants of his own time.  He gets to connect with his own self from any of the time instants that he has experienced for a duration of ten minutes/seconds/hours and hence the name of the network : TEN NET (Tenet)  Things get weird when somehow a person manages to enter another person’s time lines by breaking into their tenet , thereby causing new events in the other person’s time line and maybe a few suddenly missing events from his own due to this interference between tenets leading to severe time paradoxes.  There’s a possibility of the butterfly effect here where a small tenet interference event would’ve caused an unimaginable consequence, which needs to be reversed.",0,0,hitesh harithas,LdOM0x0XDMo,0.07440794499618031,2019-12-20 04:20:22,True,True

Eternalism and the time loop are two different things that are not interconnected. The first, which was based on a blockbuster based on the multilayered time.

In my opinion, a magnificent idea for a major spy science fiction blockbuster. Luxurious only because eternalism as a plot combination has never been raised in a big movie.

Check the  links to see for yourself...  👇🏼sharia exposed https://youtu.be/shhiYMibHjo  👇🏼Muhammad prophet of war  https://youtu.be/p_kukrJ7goE 👇🏼 What historians said regarding muhammed👇🏼 https://abu-aiman.blogspot.com/2008/03/what-famous-people-have-said-about.html?m=1  👇🏼Gary wills what the quran meant https://youtu.be/ulK5re6b52g  important message for all ... peace and love to all...  There was a man who was from  the desert over 1400 years ago, he could not read or write and was known as the truthful one. Whenever anyone went away and needed something looking after, they would entrust him to look after it, as they knew it would be safe with him.   Every one trusted him.  one day he was in a cave when he heard a voice telling  him to read, he replied I can not read. This experience was a meeting with none other than gabriel.  Over the next 23 years angel gabriel would come to him with revelations which he would recite to him,  he would go on to  revise the word, and say it to the people of that time who would than put it down in writing.  Once completed the lord up above promised that he will preserve his word  himself, and not let it be lost or distorted like what was done  with previous scriptures.  He had learned the whole 23 years of revelations by heart, and many people had done the same at that time.  This revelation is scientifically accurate, inline with modern science today, and has many scientific miracles contained in it, which they could never of known at that time,  without the modern technology which exists today.  It has been proven to be exactly the same as when it was first revealed.   And this  amazing scripture is from the lord of mankind and all that exists, the one and only true creator of the heavens and earth, the one and  only master of the day of reckoning the day of judgement.  It is the amazing Quran, If you took all the Quran copies and put them in the ocean, and totally wiped it off the net, we would reproduce it within 3 days or so in its original form in the Arabic language. How one may ask,  well we have people known as Hafiz all around the world, who have memorized the whole Quran by heart, in its original language Arabic. So we would get one hafiz  from London  one from America,  Africa, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Russia, and before you know it, it would be back in its original form, in the Arabic language. (Arabic is original language of the quran) this is a miracle in itself. If this guy (pbuh) could not read or write, then how did he come up with this???  Guys I've got nothing but love for people, no matter what your belief is, or where you're form. We only have one enemy, and that is satan. I  just wanted to share this with you.   Think to yourself with all the bad publicity Islam gets, why is it still the fastest growing religion in the world?  And if it is  so bad then why are scientists entering Islam after doing extensive research?  And why are preachers and priests entering Islam?  Look It is only my job as a Muslim  to convey the message...  As true Guidance only comes from Allah...  But their is one important thing here that  I need  to mention...  Allah says man is ever so quarellsome and most of them will believe not...  See I could never understand how anyone could not see that  the quran is the word of god. With all its proofs evidences verses signs revelations etc...  Come on guys think about it...  The  jews don't believe in christianity or islam, and they say you have to be a jew to be saved.  The Christians don't believe in Judaism or islam, and they say you will only be saved if you are a Christian.   Allah says tell them to produce their evidence if they are truthful...  Allah in the Quran  confirms that the torah , gospel, and the  bible,  were once the word of god .  But mischief makers knowingly changed the scriptures.   And god says he has sent the quran as a guidance for mankind, which clarifies the previous scriptures.  And that he will take it upon himself to preserve it until the end...  And he has done so for nearly 1500 years, and he will continue to do so until the end of time...  I  am going to leave you all some links for you's   to see what its all about for yourselves.  Please do your research before it's too late, I think we all owe it to ourselves ,as we have our eternity at stake...  I wish everyone well and all the best...  👇🏼Dr Lawrence brown  https://youtu.be/5Gr54pYc3Ak  👇🏼true story of a Christian youth minister  https://youtu.be/N4UTSO5GQdA  👇🏼sinead o Conner  https://youtu.be/uieiEAzitmU  Download if you want the truth.

2019-12-21T15:44:18,"Couple of questions and observations that I've thought of after watching the trailer a bunch of times. 1. The movie is obviously about time travel but how will time travel be done? From the scene with the ships in the ocean and also the car chase scene at the end of the trailer it looks like whatever device or method they use reverses time but leaves individuals unaffected. 2. How far back in time can they go and is there a limit or some kind of physical or existential risk if they keep doing it? Knowing Nolan I'm sure there is. 3. The trailer mentioned that they were trying to stop something worse than nuclear war from occurring. I wonder what that threat could be? I'm thinking that Nolan created a true villian to fight this time, (maybe the guy holding hands with the lady for that short second on the boat? The music seemed to changed ominously for a second when he showed his face on top of that boat or whatever it was and the sun came in behind him) or some evil organization to stop. That could definitely raise the stakes in the movie. John David Washington and Pattison are definitely some kind of time cops so it will be interesting to see how this part of the story plays out. 3. Who is Nolan consulting about the theoretical and scientific basis for time travel? Movies about time travel can open a can of worms especially when they are trying to take a serious approach about it which I'm certain Nolan is doing. Unlike Interstellar and Kip Thorne there is no real empirical evidence or mathematics that we can rely on for time travel. There is a lot of research out there about relativity and Albert Einstein proved much of it years ago. Time travel is a little more complicated in that it is all theoretical. What model of time travel will Nolan rely on? Will he take the butterfly effect model that seems to be the most popular perspective with movies where one event in the past can influence a multitude of future outcomes or will he take the perspective like Steins gate where time is a river and can only be changed by certain actions or events in the past that are dramatic enough to create another timeline? Or maybe he will do a completely different model or a combination of multiple ones. It really has me thinking and I love the fact that Christopher Nolan not only makes movies that are engaging but thought provoking as well. This is going to be fun.",1,0,M P,LdOM0x0XDMo,0.0639363354037267,2019-12-21 15:44:18,True,True

I ll give u a gist of how he would review if he had seen TENET movie trailer.  So much hype, big director, great story, genius n master story teller Nolan. We come to watch this movie trailer with these expectations. But wat we get is pure disappointment. All they ve done is make a hyper unrealistic story n tried to fool us as something out of the box. They ve just shot videos and rewinded it backwards. Big deal, they thought no one can do this. All this hype about Hollywood and Nolan is only for foolish ppl. This movie will be a waste of time n money for movie goers, they can instead do something useful. This is all I ve to say.

2019-12-23T07:01:47,"*My Theory:* The main character was part of an organization tasked with fighting insurgents and he passes a high stress training simulation that allows him to join a secret government agency. As he immediately responded ""nuclear holocaust"" to the woman, I imagine his previous line of work was something related to subduing terrorism.   The secret government agency is combating an issue brought about by foreign weapons testing that ruptures the fabric of spacetime and creates rifts in space where time flows backwards.   Kenneth Branagh is also part of the story and maybe the woman he is seeing is his wife who, having accidentally been in a time rift, had de-aged several years to that of a younger woman. Kenneth's character chooses to be next to her along these rifts but not in them to avoid de-aging with her. Maybe she doesn't want to leave the time rift to be with him because she likes seeing herself become younger, growing more addicted to it.  Also 1:23 suggests that time flows backwards in some of these rifts even if gravity exists normally.   The main characters have to navigate these rifts carefully as to not see their lives move in reverse while looking for the solution to the entire problem. Robert Pattinson helps the main character on this mission.  But it doesn't feel completely proximal since the main character crossed a physical space where time was working in reverse (when they crossed that tumbling car). I'm guessing there is something where people or objects are exclusively immune to the time effects.  Or maybe all this is taking place in someone's mind where time reversal is a way of recalling a memory where one takes steps backwards. Maybe the characters are either in that person's mind or projections of themselves navigating a memory labyrinth.   Idunno. With Christopher Nolan, it's probably something 1000x more mind bending.",1,0,Alan Parson,LdOM0x0XDMo,0.02886363636363636,2019-12-23 07:01:47,True,True

The only catch is, they will arrive in the near future of the desired event and the time will rollback till the time fed in the travel machine (or that mechanism) is reached.    E.g. If they decided to be at Bangalore Whitefield Road at 15:00 on the 21st of December 2019 to avoid the misfortunate event,    Then they will arrive at 15:02 or may be 15:03 and will start traveling backward in the chronological frames of those places. They will have only that 2-3 minutes of the time window to understand what happened there and how to avoid it by tweaking the event in real-time.

2019-12-25T16:56:16,"Here is my take - The theme is quite simple. Espionage / Doomsday film. They somehow figure out a way to travel bit ahead in time.. maybe few seconds (10sec-tenet!) and come back in reverse, literally.. against arrow of time; trying to catch / anticipate the exact moment of threat and stop it. Things happen in real time and with arrow of time but from protagonist perspective it happens in reverse.. car accident, bullets on windows, ship in reverse scenes. Nolan will definitely mix it up and show frames from either perspectives and viewers need to figure out who’s perspective they are watching at any given moment. Hence the palindrome name too.. TENET! 😉 It’s a beautiful take on arrow of time linked with second law of thermodynamics. So the visuals and VFX will be mind blowing and confusing and hence the high budget production. Memento skipped to frames in reverse chronology and then showed them forward but tenet will show the frames in reverse literally intermingled with natural flow.

2019-12-26T02:06:19,"Trailer breakdown: 0:03 hero was a cop going for a mission 0:26 he was get caught by the gangster  and he was been given poison by him, because he s not showing up himself from were he is coming from and what he was working for. This shows his loyalty. 0:34 the hero was transported to some facility were some wind mills are present. (note- here all wind mills are rotating in) clockwise. 0:37 shows hero was screened up for some bigger mission by an organization.  Here he  was totally wiped out of his past. And it is a afterlife for him. 0:46 now the hero was trying to find what is happening in the facility. 0:50 a underground laboratory inside the ship were it all happens. 0:55 doctor with white coat says its about to stop world war three. The stone she shows with some bullet markings. 0:59 the man wears a oxygen mask shows it is about something carcinogenic 1:01 in next shot they say it is not about nuclear war represent it may be a biowar. That is y the man wearing a oxygen mask. 1:07 the hero is being pushed towards some machine it may be time traveling machine or teleportation machine. 1:11 after this the wind mill and ship was going in reverse motion so this represent it may something of parallel universe or the hero was teleported to the same place but everything happens in a reverse motion. Now the title comes TENET means one of the principal on which a belief or theory is based. This represent hero is going to change the basic principle of existence to stop the third world war. That is reverse technology. project TENET. 1:18 says tenet may open right doors and some wrong doors too shows both good ppl in the ship and some bad ppl in next shot. 1:24 the military person is going in reverse motion. 1:25 hero alone walking in a reverse manner shows he is in the same place and time but due to the TENET experiment his body and mind works in a reverse manner. 1:27 oxygen mask again represent some viral carcinogen happenings. 1:29 lady says he should start looking the world in different way that is in a reverse manner. 1:30 the car reversely go and crash another car, but when hero was seeing the car was getting back to normal i.e) the crashed car was there but the accident was not happened yet. 1:53 man from the otherside of mirror asks what happened. For him it had happened but for hero from this side of the mirror it hadn't happened yet. This shows both ppl know the result but for hero it is not happened yet. This also shows the hero was teleproted to the same place but working in a reverse manner. Hero was 'N' and only he Can understand both 'TE' and mirror image of 'ET' ( sorry i cant put it in reverse manner) like user interface. that is why TENET as title.  So hero is going to the parallel universe were the world destroyed but the war didn't happened yet. Parallel universe here is nothing but the same place were the tenet person will have the reverse motion. By this he can change the core principle he can change the whole belief. Hero is traveling to the place were problem's result is there but the steps are not yet derived (note he is in the same place only the world changes) Whether he stops the war or not will be the climax  Dont try to understand the movie feel it.

That sounds impressive to you but even if he were taking grad courses it's still just introductory level. It's like leaving while testing for your advanced white belt in karate.  Can he just use the regular tools and a linear plot....and do a good movie.

I am not sure but I think he spends his energy working on projects until it is a Dark Knight. In fact, I heard that his best work is when the sun goes down and the Dark Knight Rises. Due to that, he ended up not being able to sleep and contracted Insomnia. That being said, The Prestige of that man does not allow him to stop from working properly. I've been Following his story for quite some time and I noticed when reading his Memento that he actually loves Batman. Begins the journey of this great man, like the journey of those civilians who trekked their way into Dunkirk. The Tenet of this guy's filmmaking approach is that he does not like CGI but would prefer to have everything done practically.

With a numb body, I was able to see everything and I still remember each and every part of it but couldnt respond to anything. My friends were very scared watching me like this. I was numb for more than an hour and throughout the time I just spoke for like 4-5 words and that was “So this is what happens” in front of my friends. Inside my head, I was completing the sentence “so this is what happens AFTER DEATH.” So I was experiencing that I was dead already and everything is going on the backward side and it will be like this till the day I was born(the day I would come alive again). This is not any made up story. It could be because of ,I so believe in time travelling and I seek for answers that are unknown or may be hallucinations.

2020-04-26T18:38:19,"I feel as if this is based on the ""theory of the reversibility of the universe"" propounded by the obscure genius William James Sidis.  It is based on  the idea of the reversibility of everything in time, that is, that every type of process has its time-image, a corresponding process which is its exact reverse with respect to time. This accounts for all physical laws but one, namely, the second law of thermodynamics. However, the theory says  that even the second law of thermodynamics can be reversed. According to Maxwell, this reversal was actually theoretically possible which he explained in his ""sorting demon"" hypothetical experiment. Moreover, Kelvin was also of the view that life is  a reversal of the second law of thermodynamics.

Personally, I think the silver screen is the most true way to experience good film.   Recently, Universal Studios announced they will release streaming releases the same time they premier theatrical premiers. This is going to KILL theaters nation-wide.  Blockbuster is a time of the past, but I think forcing theaters to close their doors will ensure mass societal buyers remose. Regardless of the Netflix convenience factor or the financial savings of having a big family expense; theaters provide a lifelong service.   Christopher Nolan's new movie TENET is tentatively the first big-buget blockbuster movie to premiere after the mass economic shutdown. It's the support of this film that most likey will enforce or devalue the point of Universal Studios.

2020-05-25T06:34:41,"My best guess about this movie is that there's a secret piece of tech that can somehow tap into and manipulate anti-time. Whatever vehicle or method being used is probably referred to as ""Tenet"". Theoretically, anti-time flows in the exact opposite direction of real time, so past events in real time invariably become future events in anti-time (and vice versa). Keep in mind, real time is relative to the perspective of the user. Tenet may allow the user to alter critical future events in anti-time using knowledge of the same exact events that already happened in real time's past. Thus, tapping into and manipulating anti time's future is actually altering real time's past. The opposite is theoretically true, so perhaps Tenet also allows the user to alter his future using the same methodology in reverse. This seems like it would be an incredibly coveted & priceless tool to have so I'm sure lots of ridiculously powerful people & entities want or already have access to it. Enter all the big players - Caine, Pattinson, Branagh, some secret government agency, etc. Moving between realms is probably dangerous which may explain why some characters are wearing gas masks. Could be some sort of chemical that sustains a person's sanity while he navigates through an anti-time world. The flow of time is opposite in every sense of the word, so communication, time, perception of reality, etc. is most likely incomprehensible to the mind of someone who experiences real time (and vice versa). Also, I would guess that the time flow physics is reversed for objects that cross realms as well. That's why his bullets were ""caught"" and that gear ""dropped up"" into his hand. Notice he's wearing a green glove in both shots. Probably to avoid some sort of quantum annihilation.",0,0,Carlos Rodriguez,LdOM0x0XDMo,0.10263157894736841,2020-05-25 06:34:41,True,True

2020-06-01T03:40:51,"Imagine if ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" is not even your best work. Christopher Nolan is a god among Hollywood film makers.  So much of Hollywood is filled with garbage and desperate movies that are completely awful or middling at best. Everything he does is so spectacular that the Batman series is probably in the middle of his best pieces.  How do you even rate these without saying almost all of them are great?  Even his lower rated movies when he was younger are still fantastic.  In no particular order: -Inception -Interstellar -Memento -Dunkirk -Batman Begins -The Dark Knight -The Dark Knight Rises -Following -The Prestige -Insomnia How can anyone even rate these movies without saying they are all great?  I'd say Insomnia and Following are near the bottom, but they are still great movies.

2020-06-15T06:55:02,"The word TENET is a palindrome. That could be a thematic idea of this new film cleverly captured in the title. The thematic idea being that something can exist that is the same forward as it is backwards. In fact the trailer already shows several instances of time reversal. And after all many of Nolan's films deal with the bizarre philosophies of time and time dilation and expansion (Memento, Inception, Interstellar, Dunkirk). Maybe this film is about mirrored time? I doubt this is true but I wouldn't put it past Nolan to design something in a 5 act way 1. T 2. E 3. N 4. E 5. T. Act 1 and 5 will be mirrors of eachother (Both T), 2 and 4 as well (Both E) and 3 will be the standalone middle act that is itself some dramatic mirror sequence of itself. Even the symbol of the letter N has a certain mirrored dual symmetry to it. So perhaps this whole film will be sort of cyclical , so that it ends where it begins and vice versa, the way the word TENET does, in an bizarre, Nolanesque  mind fuck sort of way.

Now recall in Inception how Arthur told Ariadne how the dream sharing programs were developed so soldiers could kill each other and then wake up (which would be like waking up in the ""afterlife""). So I think what we are seeing is an elite spy training test where they interrogate Washington for information and he holds out until they kill him.
