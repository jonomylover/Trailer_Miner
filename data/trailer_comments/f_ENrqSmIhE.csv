This movie relies on Idris Elba's handsomeness and Taraji Henson's star power and beauty instead of character development, pacing, interesting dialogue etc... 3. Older black prison guard cares more about Elba getting a second chance even though he is clearly disturbed rather than the safety of the general population 4. Idris Elba can force his nose to bleed. How do you do that? 5. Idris Elba is apparently an expert marksman and can shoot 2 cops with .25 seconds. 6. We never see of any news stories relating to an escaped criminal that killed two cops. 7. How did Idris Elba get that van when he was stalking his ex-girlfriend? 8. The only plot device that moves the story along is apparently thunder. 9. People got paid to write this slop 10. Taraji Henson is apparently the most clueless DA in the history of the united states and lets a stranger in her home at night and gives him alcohol. 11. Taraji Henson's loose friend is apparently more intuitive than a DA and can tell Idris Elba is a lying bozo. 12. Idris Elba acting is wooden and stilted, but we'll forgive him because he's handsome. 13. Taraji Henson never kills Idris Elba the first 4 times she gets a chance with fire extenguishers, glass, knives etc. She hits him once and runs away, allowing him to recover. 14. Taraji Henson slaps (assaults) her husband at the end of the movie and the police do nothing. 15. The police officer apparently never graduated from the Darren Wilson ""Shoot huge black guys when the charge you"" Academy. 16. Why didn't Taraji Henson mouth ""HELP ME"" when the police officer asked her if everything was away when he asked her to get out of the car? That wouldn't have made any noise. 17. The African lady sitting next to me keeps pointing out how stupid Taraji Henson's character is. I know lady, I know. 18. Idris Elba's dead ex-girlfriend's cell phone battery apparently lasts for days on end without having to be charged. What company is she with? 19. What exactly is Idris Elba's plan here? It's never stated. 20. Taraji Henson goes (ableit involuntarily) into Idris Elba's dead girlfriend's dark and scary house at night when there could be a torture chamber or who knows what inside there. 21. Isn't Taraji Henson innocent in all this? Her husband is cheating on her so why does she deserve all this? What is her culpability? 22. Idris Elba has the patience of a saint and calms down immediately after Taraji Henson stabs him and bludgeons him with random objects. Yet almost flips on the parole board guy for telling the truth about him. 23. Taraji Henson's repeated ""You don't have to do this"" cliché. 24. Dark and stormy night cliche 25. The ending scene is not explained at all, is completely tacked on and is unrelated to anything that happened previously in the movie. 26. This movie does not contain a lap dance from Taraji Henson.
