Love interested ( if it ever a black female whos the lead role , dont expect for her to be in love with a White guy , who the writes push so hold to really be the main character)  3. their kind is a reunited ( everyone comes together  to use their powers to fight off the Government , but at the end show/movie they  some hug reunited of everyone of their kind )  4. Government  is the bad guy ( yes yes yes yes we know that the Government is the bad guy , but do it always have to have to be in every movie? it just like doing number 2 in this list witch now became super boring and pointless ) 5. some one in the group always dies ( yes its always some on the main group gets killed, it looks more like the asain girl will get killed )  6. Movies 2 ( these kinds of movies always try to make a part 2 and 3 witch already part one suck so why do the other 2 films )  7. Main characters are Point less ( if the main character is the strongest or one of the strongest ,and the Government already have others that are just as strong or stronger . then why go after that one little Character ,when you have a army just as strong/stronger of people in her same class )  8. movies are off books ( yeah these kinds of movies just came form books. )   this is a few points why i dont watch these kinds of movies",0,0,Jacob the First and last knight,olb97DDMitk,0.059553872053872074,2018-03-31 14:02:36,True,True

Clearly enough loved their kids, they tried to fight for them (as I can see in the trailer)- it's a weird theme I noticed in these genre of books and movies, where all the good guys are teens and kids, and every adult is corrupt or dies and meh- that's just unrealistic, it breaks my immersion so hard. Sure it's a wish fulfillment, I'm sure a good bunch of us millennials will eat this up- but as a teen it never made sense to me, and I did have a horrible time with adult and authority figures too, but even then I knew the trope of ""adults = evil"" was kinda stupid. Already in the trailer I can see, "" the only people who would ever help us, are us."" I hope that guy is proven wrong.  PLEASE prove me wrong movie!!! I'm seeing the people who worked on Stranger Things worked on this, and that gives me hope. Thankfully I never read these books in particular, so can someone confirm if that's the thing that happened in them? Maybe the movie is just doing it and the books are great.

I watched it and thought it was interesting and maybe a superhero movie with a young female lead I can relate with. I looked up the movie and found it was based on a book series and I was overjoyed, since I've been looking for books to read and this met my liking. After reading the other one's quickly, I'm on the third book. This is now my favorite book series. After reading the first book, I went back to see the trailer and it does not serve the book justice. But then again, when does it ever? In all honestly, I can see this at least TV-14, especially when it comes to the second book. This series has so much heart and emotion, like many other books turned into movies. However, even the trailer has some flaws, I look forward to see this movie. I hope it doesn't turn to Divergent and lose sight of what the books are. I hope it doesn't turn into a teen romance rather than a series about Ruby facing her darkness.
