So, instead of doing something different, like playing with the aesthetic of the film, which would've been smart (setting it in the 80's or 70's or even the 50's) they just retread things to try and be culturally appropriate. Nope. It's not working man...even using the old school 70's inspired font for ""Proud Marry"" at the end is just wack. Give us a black character that could compete with James Bond, John Wick, or any other movie icon without copying the other films beat for beat even all the way down to the way the trailer is edited.

It's that this movie looks generic as hell. We've gotten so many of these movies about these one-man (or woman) badass killing machines (Taken, Salt, The Transporter, Non-Stop, John Wick, Atomic Blonde just to name a few) recently. And the creators probably think they'll get away with this one and maybe even be praised for making it just because they went ""Hey lets do that, but make the lead an African American female."" We don't need another one of these movies, we want originality. We want something we've never seen before. One could argue ""Well you've probably never seen this before"" and to that I say no I have. Just when I saw it before the lead was a guy and white.   And I am all for gender equality in movies and everywhere else, but if you want an empowering female lead:  1. Do something original  2. Stop praising yourself for doing it so much.  - Seriously about this one (The ""P    M____ Proud Mary"" thing was a bit over the top. Again, totally for gender equality, but stop patting yourself on the back so much. If the movie is good it will speak for itself. You don't need to shove it down our throats with your gimmicks and shit. Neither Wonder Woman nor the Hunger Games did this. And they were both great (at least until Mockingly part 1 and 2). They didn't need to go *""HEY HEY LOOK AT US WE'RE MAKING A FILM WITH A STRONG FEMALE LEAD THAT""S KICKIN ASS ALL THE TIME GIVE US YOUR PRAISE FOR BEING REVOLUTIONARY.""* They were just good movies that people went to see because they were good.
