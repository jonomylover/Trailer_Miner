So... I'm excited, but I suspect the film will be no more than 90 minutes and all the drama will be manufactured. A film like Apollo 13 -- the story itself had tons of drama, so all you had to do was tell it.

Maybe sound mixing, sound editing and some technical recognition. 2. Who cares if the story is accurate or not? I'm watching it because I'm a film lover, I like Gosling and Chazelle's work and this film surely looks worth watching. I bet the movie it's not about Apolo 11 or the landing per se but a personal and intimate look at a regular american citizen's life; a man called Neil Armstrong who just works hard on his job, which happens to be the first man on the moon. But seems to be a personal biopic. 3. I don't give a damn about the moon landing being a hoax directed by Stanley Kubrick, (if it is, kudos to Kubrick) but, let's allow others to believe and have some faith. Even if it's fake, to think that human race went to the Moon during the 60s is exciting, enjoyable and something really out of this world to believe in (pardon for the bad pun.

Now I gotta go see this movie, and I'm taking my brother with me. Besides, being a man who works with computers and algorithms all day, I'm interested to see how some of the NASA personnel were able to work out math algorithms for the trajectories, and work with IBM computers to bring man to the moon, then giving those equations to Neil and the pilots so they can work them out. By the time I upgrade my computer in September 2020, I'll have a machine a few trillion times more powerful than the one it took to bring man to the moon. Even our phones are more powerful than that IBM computer. Those computers back then operated with punch cards, using Fortran as the language.

2018-09-01T09:52:34,"‪I like Ryan Gosling as an actor but he had nothing to do with this New World Order script that is a slap in the face of all Americans. ‬  ‪The producers, writers and financiers of this little flick decided ON PURPOSE (not a mistake or “oversight”) to not include the truly American iconic moment when Neal Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted our US Flag 🇺🇸 on the moon and then backed up to give it a nice and respectful salute. It was one of the very first things that they did. To put it in this little flick would have taken up maybe 15 seconds of screen time and used only one more prop: The Flag! ‬  ‪We beat the Commie Ruskies there, an important US goal that was first, and incredibly at the time, envisioned by John F. Kennedy in another iconic moment still in our collective memories as a People. Yes, it was important to us at the time that we did beat the Ruskies  - not to mention (and it definitely was not mentioned publically) that it was a very nice program to help develop very powerful rockets 🚀 for our defense at a time when the Ruskies were parking nukes 90 miles from our shore. ‬  ‪The producers, writers and financiers of this little flick are trying to claim that Neil Armstrong, being a shy man who shunned publicity, considered the accomplishment one of “the world’s” and not of just the little ‘ol US. They imply he would approve leaving out the planting of the Flag on the Moon. ‬  ‪Complete nonsense! He was a member of same Social Fraternity, Phi Delta Theta (mine, University of Miami FL; his Miami University OH) and I will stand up for his patriotism, which was well known. He loved his country. ‬  ‪The following is not the makings of a man lukewarm toward his country or about his also being the first AMERICAN to plant our US Flag 🇺🇸 on another heavenly body? No way!‬  ‪[Borrowed heavily from Wikipedia, which borrowed heavily from: Hansen, James R. (2005), First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong.]‬  ‪He saw action in the Korean War where he was hit by anti-aircraft fire while making a low bombing run, and forced to bail out. ‬  ‪After flying such experimental aircraft as the X-15, he was chosen as NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster. His great skill and level head under life threatening circumstances saved his life and the Astronaut with him. That was #1. While training for his spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11, he had to eject from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments before a fiery crash. That was #2. These things come in 3’s, right? On 20 July 1969, during the landing, at the very last possible moment - to avoid the disaster of crashing the LEM on top of a big boulder - Armstrong took over piloting from the auto-pilot and landed in a flat area beyond. And that was #3. Three times he almost died in service to his country. ‬  ‪His later years after leaving NASA were spent as a quiet college professor, although he did serve on a number of American companies Boards of Directors and was a spokesperson for other companies.  ‬  ‪He never acted as a spokesperson for any company that was not American.‬  ‪This was an American Man who loved his country, loved what it had allowed him to become and who loved and respected our American Flag 🇺🇸. Neil Armstrong is probably rolling over in his grave. Well, actually he was cremated and his remains scattered at sea aboard a US Ship of War and under a US Flag 🇺🇸. So maybe he’s rolling over on the waves that the producers, writers and financiers of this little flick intentionally omitted that the flag he planted on the Moon was an American Flag 🇺🇸.‬  ‪So, speaking for myself, I’ll wait until a good movie comes out about our national hero Neil A. Armstrong  - and maybe it will be one that respects our US Flag 🇺🇸 under which he proudly served.‬  ‪Carl D.

The Telegraph reports that Canadian actor Ryan Gosling said that the American moon landing “transcended countries and borders,” and that instead of being an American achievement, it was a “human achievement.” Globalist propaganda garbage. It was an American achievement which happened during the Cold War and succeeded in the iconic moment of planting the American flag on the moon, with America being the only country so far to this day to actually achieve manned landings there. It was a human achievement, in a race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union at the time.

2018-09-02T06:23:15,"Neil's sons:  ""We've read a number of comments about the film today and specifically about the absence of the flag planting scene, made largely by people who haven't seen the movie. As we've seen it multiple times, we thought maybe we should weigh in. This is a film that focuses on what you don't know about Neil Armstrong. It's a film that focuses on things you didn't see or may not remember about Neil's journey to the moon. The filmmakers spent years doing extensive research to get at the man behind the myth, to get at the story behind the story. It's a movie that gives you unique insight into the Armstrong family and fallen American Heroes like Elliot See and Ed White. It's a very personal movie about our dad's journey, seen through his eyes. This story is human and it is universal. Of course, it celebrates an America achievement. It also celebrates an achievement ""for all mankind,"" as it says on the plaque Neil and Buzz left on the moon. It is a story about an ordinary man who makes profound sacrifices and suffers through intense loss in order to achieve the impossible. Although Neil didn't see himself that way, he was an American hero. He was also an engineer and a pilot, a father and a friend, a man who suffered privately through great tragedies with incredible grace. This is why, though there are numerous shots of the American flag on the moon, the filmmakers chose to focus on Neil looking back at the earth, his walk to Little West Crater, his unique, personal experience of completing this journey, a journey that has seen so many incredible highs and devastating lows. In short, we do not feel this movie is anti-American in the slightest. Quite the opposite. But don't take our word for it. We'd encourage everyone to go see this remarkable film and see for themselves.""",101,30,Dwight K. Schrute,w4GtJB5WAlQ,0.04231292517006803,2018-09-02 06:23:15,True,True

Let me tell you again, the flag is in the movie!!! No, they don't ""plant"" the flag, but there is PLENTY OF SHOTS WITH THE FLAG ON THE MOON.  Armstrong and Aldrin spent 152 minutes walking on the moon, so a movie can't show every single minute of that. They did a number of task on the moon during their moonwalk, and it can't all fit into a single movie. I would rather see the astronauts exploring the moon and doing experiments, then see them planting a flag for five minutes. From a story telling perceptive, that would be a waste of screen time. The plaque they left behind read ""Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace FOR ALL MANKIND"" Sound very unpatriotic to me, and more a celebration of human civilization. That is what this movie is trying to show.

2018-09-26T22:13:21,"The flat earth debate is quite simply, over.  It is no longer up for debate.  Everyone, with the exception of our grandmothers, who still use push button land lines, knows the truth.  The evidence is absolutely *overwhelming,* and all it takes is ones attempt to de-bunk it, which always, always, always, results in 100% belief.      -#1 Proof:  The horizon *never* recedes / the curve is *never* observed – the horizon ALWAYS remains at eye level with ANY rise in altitude.  Observe this for yourself on your next airline flight.  If the earth was a sphere, the horizon *would* recede, to *some* *measurable,* *observable* degree, by very *definition* of being on, and rising above, the surface of a *sphere!*  -God in heaven, where is the Googlemaps imagery of the poles!!!???  WHY are we not allowed to see this imagery?  WHAT are they hiding???!!!  WTH?!  It’s astonishing that this fact alone doesn’t cause an absolute pitchforks and torches march on every government in the world – shows how brainwashed sheeple really are not to rise up over this alone.  -You say you can observe the ship going over the horizon, so wouldn’t/shouldn’t you be able to observe that same curve to your left and right field of vision..?  -- Fool.  Ships that ‘disappear’ over the horizon become perfectly visible, right down to the water line, once a high-powered camera zoom is used, *every* single time.  Go, experiment for yourself, brainwashed, mocking, uneducated fools, with nothing more than a high school or B.S., government socialized indoctrinated mush of regurgitated concepts rotting your God-given brain.     -A 3-axis gyro placed on a table for 24 hours, will NOT rotate, at all.  Gyros *prove* the *earth* *doesn’t* *move.*  An airliner gyro is leveled during preflight and remains level for the duration of its flight.  It NEVER is adjusted, even as airliners fly over the oceans to other continents.  There is NO computer adjustment nor any flight training addressing of the subject of adjusting them for flight over oceans and for the planet and sun spinning all over the universe.  Gyros PROVE FE.    -why has the position of Polaris and the constellations not moved out of position at all over the course of centuries!?  If the earth is racing around the sun and the sun is racing around the galaxy and the galaxy is racing around the universe (at combined speeds of over 500,000 mph), why would the constellations remain unchanged for 6 THOUSAND years of recorded earth history..?  -The area under the Eagle lander's 10,000lb rocket motor, all around Neil's footprint squished into the fine, talc power-like dust, is *pristine* and *undisturbed*  WTH?! Why in hell would that TEN THOUSAND POUND rocket motor not disturb that same dust just one little tiny bit?  The black and white video clip from Apollo 11, viewing downward, as the Eagle descends, clearly shows blast radius effects occurring.  BL, it’s always impossible to concoct a perfect lie – the story of the lie will *always* have inconsistencies.     -Pictures of earth, provided from NASA are NOT consistent, AT ALL, and most all of them look like, and ARE, photo-shopped images.  -Dear GOD, the shadow of the moon on the earth during a lunar eclipse, is only, get this, 70 MILES WIDE!  No shadow can be smaller than the object itself!  A 70 mile wide shadow of the moon on the earth is impossible if the sun was 93 million miles away and if the moon was TWO THOUSAND, FIVE HUNDRED miles in diameter, like we’re told.    -South latitude flights between continents – something very strange going on --- see Flightradar24.com or any other world flight tracking website – you will be stunned to observe the thousands of millions of constant flights between the north latitude continents but NEVER any direct flights observed between south latitude continents -- only exception will be one or two occasional fake flights that DISAPPEAR, soon after take off.  You see, on the real, flat earth, the south lat continents are so far apart, an airline can not make the journey, and are routed up through Europe and North America to get to their destination.  Such sites are real time proof of FE, every hour of the day.    -- Pilots are not ‘in on it,’ they just do their job like we all do.  However, no pilot that you will EVER meet, has EVER flown the routes between Buenos Aires to Johannesburg or Johannesburg to Perth or Sydney to Buenos Aires.  The only pilot you’ll ever meet who claims to have done this is the scientology Hollywood leftist liberal, sell my soul to Satan to gain fame and look down on the rest of the flyover country, Oprah loving freak, Mr. John Travolta.  -THERE IS NO OBSERVABLE, MEASURABLE CURVE, EVER.  .. unless a fish-eye lens is used TO WARP THE TRUTH, and ‘refraction‘ an effect that *shifts* light, not curves light, such as a pencil in a glass of water, does not account for the fact that we can see islands and light houses in the distance up to over ONE HUNDERED MILES away, when those same islands should be SIX THOUSAND FEET below the horizon.  -Red Bull jump used FISH EYE LENS! Horizon was FLAT, at 120,000ft – see Red Bull jump pics looking out of door – horizon is FLAT – Fish eye warped the earth so much that Arizona appeared to cover the entire hemisphere, yet sheeple look at it and think it’s the globe.  Pathetic.    -INFINITE photographic anomalies with Apollo photos   -*Endless* *endless* list of world geographic and man-made features seen all day long from far beyond where they should --Shoreline of Chicago seen from 80 miles away across the lake on *ANY* clear day -80 mile long Salt Lake Utah flats have NO observable curve -Lighthouses seen up to 120 miles away – no observable curve! -Ships 'over horizon' - hulls clearly observable using telephoto lens   - *Actual* curve formula is 8 inches X distance squared.  1 mile = 8 inches, 2 mile = 32 inches, 5 miles = 16 feet, 10 miles = 66 feet, 20 miles = 266 feet, 1000 miles = is nearly 700,000 feet or about 128 miles.  Meanwhile, intelligent NASA folk, your worthless government school high school teacher, and Wikipedia still state the curve formula is 8 inches per mile.. uh,.. in which case would be a slope, not a curve.    -2016 NASA clip of moon passing in front of earth is a damnable, ridiculous joke.  It looks like, as is, a photo shop lie.    -NASA currently says on their Orion website:  ‘we can’t go back to the moon until we solve the van Van Allen belt ‘challenge’.. say WHAAT?!  Either the Van Alen belts exist or not, and we now know they don’t.  There are no belts, but NASA lied about it back in the 60’s, so now they have to keep their story straight.    -NASA has been forced to admint that earth ‘photos’ are actually photo-shopped composites! – NASA ‘official’ earth ‘photos’ from throughout the decades also show completely inconsistent continent sizes  -Antarctic treaty allows no one to go to explore or commercialize the south pole, for ALL TIME -- Only way in to the supposed pole on a stick out in the snow, is by military escort to the small chrome domed pole, then you’re escorted back out.  Fools then think they’ve, ‘been to the south pole.’  -Light coming through clouds is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS.. RADIAL. IF the sun was 93 mil away, those rays would be PARALLEL!!!  Observe for yourself on any day and ponder that a 93 million mile away sun ray beams would be, should be, parallel.  NASA then invents the word, ‘corpuscular’ to cause you to continue to accept what you actually see to fit with your cognitive dissonance.    -Apollo 11’s Neil, Buzz and Michael sheepishly looking guilty and ashamed during their first press conference after the supposed moon landing, then stating they, ‘don’t recall’ if they ‘saw the stars’ - !!!  -- this was supposedly mankind’s most monumental achievement in world history, and they don’t remember if they saw the stars or not?!  They were lying, and they were ashamed of it.    - TIDES! let's talk about THAT. Go google tides. It will blow your mind when you see how there is NO WAY IN HELL THE MOON IS CAUSING THEM. Amphidromic points (earth's tidal nodes) reveal a pattern that is completely at odds with the hog wash you’ve been indoctrinated with from government-school.  -No astronaut has EVER tested a space suit in a sealed vacuum chamber and they never will, because ‘space suits’ don’t even exist.  Only in a swimming pool are they used,.. where the pressure comes from the OUTSIDE, not the inside.    -Look at weather radar from Miami tracking hurricanes passing to the south of Florida!  OMG!  They routinely observe rain patterns at a constant line of sight over Cuba, *hundreds* of miles away, all the way to the ground!  IMPOSSIBLE on a globe.  But, as we all understand by now, it is NOT a globe.     -Tons of vids coming out with every day of people launching high altitude balloons and viewing the FLAT EARTH, at as much as 120,000 feet - List is endless, endless, endless..   Common response to all of this list is typically short mocking quips, or that’s just parallax, or, how dare you dishonor Neil and Buzz, or, NASA says there’s a laser reflector on the moon that proves it!  By the way, there is absolutely ZEE-RO USAF or other military aircrew training that addresses ‘parallax’ warping of what is seen in the sky, on the horizon, or anywhere else for that matter.  That’s because, as you ought to understand by now, the earth is not curved, it’s flat.",0,0,Joseph111,w4GtJB5WAlQ,0.046102430555555546,2018-09-26 22:13:21,True,True

I will not, because Hollywood decided that Neil Armstrong planted the AMERICAN FLAG on the moon was political incorrect, and that is bullshit. That one act of planting the AMERICAN FLAG is the proudest achievement of American in the 60s and 70s. it shows the world that America is innovative, that DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM and LIBERTY is greater than Communism. That the Soviet Unions lost the space race and in the international stage, that meant a lot since the world was literally divide between the USA and The USSR back then. But now, the reason for the movie not showing the flag because it may offend a lot of people, that (in the word of ryan gosling): ""it is not American achievement but the world achievement"". Really? the world's problems (terrorism, mass immigration, political correctness) are now America's problems/fault/responsibility, but America's greatest achievement since ENDING SLAVERY, is now the world's achievement? So NO, no matter how great the movie is, I choose not to spend my hard earned money on it. If anyone here want to see it, great, they can do whatever they want with their money.  As for me, I probly take the $100 i would have spend, in theater, to see this movie and take my family to the zoo.

So many people getting riled up over the American flag not being shown being planted on the moon in a movie about the biography of Neil Armstrong, the very man who quoted “One giant leap for mankind” and he was in aware that he was not just doing it for America, but for humanity as a whole which the movie is paying respects to. Everyone here is just “liberals and hollywood ruining my great American movie to please SJW cucks.” when it has nothing to do with that (well, slightly. there’s some liberal SJW shit being force plastered in bits of the movie) or “hurr durr why not just make a WW2 movie but without nations and ideologies then? xddddd epic meme.” Over the slightest thing, no man should have logic lower than what 65% of this comment section displays. No, it’s not wrong to be patriotic to your own nation, but if it’s to the point where you’re gonna boycott and entire movie and a studio for one small decision, it’s kinda sad really. Kind of does make your patriotism look more insecure and hypocritical, depending if you’re that super patriotic person (not just Americans).

Dude acted like he resented being the guy who was the first in accomplishing the greatest feat in the history of mankind, or in the history of universe as far as we know.   Inanimate matter came to life and became self aware and then looked up at a satellite orbiting the world it inhabited and then blasted itself towards it in a metal tub, then got out in a rubber suit and danced around and then came back to it's world unscathed.   All untested equipment, all never before tested manuevers.. using tech you can find in a birthday card at Walgreens.   Fucking nailed it on the first try without a single hitch. The single most impressive feat any living organism has ever accomplished, BIG TIME....  And he drops out of the public eye, never gives interviews and gives some kinda cryptic speech that implies there's some kinda hidden truth that youngsters need to uncover? As if he wasn't aware that it sounds like hes lending creedence to moon hoax theories.  Yet still he gave that speech knowing moon hoaxers we're a thing.   You'd never hear a speech like that from, say, the first guy to climb Everest. Alluding to maybe there's more to the story than simply... the was the first to climb Everest. Did James Cameron sulk around and  vanish from the public eye after he descended into the Trench in a mini sub? Or allude to there being some protected truth about the matter?   So what's the deal... Neil?   Are ya saying it's a hoax and ya hate having to lie about it?   Or perhaps you are saying that you resent that you aren't the first and that NASA didn't really nail it on the first try... Meaning we have dead astronauts up on the Moon that you take credit for? Did ya dub over some dead man's footage?

The time on the moon consisted of getting out of the lunar space craft walking around collecting a few rocks and planting the symbol of America, the flag. That’s it.  Wernher von Braun made rockets financed by Germany’s National Socialist. They used the rockets to destroy England, it was a complete failure. Von Braun moved to America and became an American citizen. His rockets successfully made the trip to the moon. Wernher von Braun original dream was to go to the moon, it was promoted by Walt Disney himself too.  Omitting the flag is like not showing shots of the rocket because it’s a symbol of phallic oppression. People hate being lied to.

His home life was showed as a total failure with Armstrong too afraid to even talk to his kids before leaving for the Apollo 11 flight.  Armstrong is seen as lost, not knowing what to do with his life, very unfriendly, in his own little world and a person with a terrible bad attitude.  The scenes of the space crafts (especially the Gemini 8) are filmed as old rust buckets that are dirty, falling apart and poorly built. Case in point; many of the switches in the Gemini 8 cockpit were rusted, paint worn off surfaces, and sound effects for the Gemini 8 that sounded like a 100 year old tug boat about to fall apart.  A very poorly made ridiculous movie that seemed to be produced to belittle NASA and the U.S. Space Program as a broken down program run by idiots who hired an emotionally hurt and depressed test pilot, Neil Armstrong, for a mission that was carried out in piles of space junk.

In the book the author goes into great detail  describing Armstrong's thoughts and concerns during the mission.   It was very apparent from Neil's words that two of his greatest concerns were the LM landing and the subsequent assent from the moon back into lunar orbit for it's docking with the command module.  Neither had ever been done before.  If the assent vehicle engine did not ignite, as Neil pointed out, Buzz and he would have only had a couple days before certain death.  The author also details Neil's concerns about the planting of flag.  The fact that the pole could only depressed it about 6"" into the lunar soil before hitting the crust was of great concern.  Neil feared it would fall over and lay forever in the lunar dust.  He seemed very relieved when they managed to get the flag to stay upright.  It was obviously very important to him.   It was clear the assent back into lunar orbit was very tense requiring all of their attention focused inside of the vehicle to avoid any mistakes that could have cost them their lives.  As Neil points out, that once the engine ignited he did not much time to look out the window at the surface of the moon.  But Neil did make time for one thing as they rocketed away:  to check on the flag.  He was saddened to see that their rocket burn on lift off had blown the flag over and it was laying in the dust.  I can't say if the movie 'First Man' dishonored the flag or not since I have not bothered to watch it.  Nor do I plan to.  I can only surmise two things:  One, that the flag was unimportant to those who created the movie.
