It's about someone who takes out their anger on others because of their own problems and runs away from their responsibilities. The Good Dinosaur is a good lesson that even adults should follow. No matter how tough or big you are, if you aren't scared, you aren't alive. Getting through your fears to reveal a world of adventure is WAY more fun and appealing than ""let it go.""

2016-11-12T20:25:48,"I honestly don't get what the whole hype about this movie was. The animation is amazing but that for me was the only thing good about the movie. I gave this movie a rewatch and I still didn't enjoy it. The characters were extremely bland. The voice acting was extremely bland. The story was very boring and predictable. The message wasn't that strong. It just felt like the main character didn't need to do much but just get home. There was nothing fun about the adventure. I think this movie was not aimed at my age. But for some reason I know people my age who like this film. I wish somebody could tell me what made the film so good????? Is it because it's Pixar???? If so than that excuse is ridiculous. People need to learn that not every Pixar film is going to be a masterpiece. And I personally think this is worse than Cars 2. Cars 2 was bad but at least it wasn't boring and cliche. I personally thought this was the worst animated film of 2015. Even worse than Strange Magic, Home, Hotel Transylvania 2, and Minions. Because at least they were not boring. This is probably in my Top 20 Worst Animated Films Of All Time. All I gotta say is I can't recommend this to anyone. The movie was so overrated. People only defend it because it is Pixar. Even if the movie is good or not ( With the exception of cars 2.) All I have to say is this movie was just not meant for me. I did not enjoy it at all. Other than the animation. Look at Inside Out for an example, the animation might not be the best. But at least they put more effort in the movies plot and characters. Unlike The Good Dinosaur where they cared more about the animation than the actual movie. I give this film a 3/10.
