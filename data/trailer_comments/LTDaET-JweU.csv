Newman's score for Skyfall was generic, but Arnold's has only gotten better with each film he was in (from Tomorrow Never Dies to QoS).

I liked the films since Casino Royale without all the flash, it made Bond seem more real, more in danger. But, it is such staple part of the film history for the Bond series so I guess it was inevitable. At least I'm confident this actor and director will do it well. -- For anyone reading this who hasn't read the original novels written by Ian Fleming of James Bond, I really think everyone should give them a try. They are timeless and paint such a detailed picture of Bond ... not as an invincible super agent, but as a normal man working as a British spy after WWII, who's committed to his work, has an almost Sherlock Holmes way of taking in the details of people and situations, and enjoys women, drinking, eating, and smoking ... not because he's trying to be cool or even because he's a hedonist, but simply because he really does believe he will likely die at any moment and so he accepts that and resolves to enjoy such simple pleasures whenever possible.",1,1,Tristan Gunn,LTDaET-JweU,0.17083333333333336,2015-07-22 16:13:20,True,True

2015-07-22T20:40:57,"Guys... have you noticed how sinister the world is becoming?   Here are some recent news headlines. Try and tell me the world isn't spiraling out of control...  STREET ANARCHY IN BALTIMORE FUELS RASH OF HOMICIDES: In Baltimore, Maryland, Antoinette Perrine has barricaded her front door since her brother was killed three weeks ago on a basketball court near her home in the Harlem Park neighborhood of West Baltimore. She already has iron bars outside her windows and added metal slabs on the inside to deflect the gunfire. “I’m afraid to go outside,” said Perrine, 47. “It’s so bad, people are afraid to let their kids outside. People wake up with shots through their windows. Police used to sit on every corner, on the top of the block. These days? They’re nowhere.”  TEXAS TOWNS BRACE FOR MORE FLOODING AS DEATH TOLL CLIMBS: The National Weather Service says hail, tornadoes and thunderstorms are possible across the southern Plains Thursday evening and that flooding remains the greatest threat for areas that have received record rainfall. Blanco County emergency management spokesman Ben Oakley also said for the first time that five people are missing in Blanco County. That’s in addition to the 10 people already counted as dead and eight missing in central Texas flooding.  ISIS FORCES CIVILIANS TO WATCH EXECUTIONS IN ANCIENT CITY’S AMPHITHEATRE: ISIS rounded up civilians trapped in Palmyra and forced them to watch 20 people be executed in the historic city’s ancient amphitheatre, a Syrian monitoring group has claimed. The Unesco World Heritage site was overrun by militants last week, threatening the future of 2,000 year-old monuments and ruins. Thousands of Palmyra’s residents fled but many are still living within the city walls, while the UN human rights office in Geneva said it had received reports of Syrian government forces preventing people from leaving until they retreated from the city.  TEENS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE CONJURING UP DEMONS ON TWITTER: A game that purports to invoke a Mexican demon – known as “Charlie, Charlie” and considered to be a simplified version of the Ouija board – has gone viral on social media among young people, prompting one exorcist to warn of its dangers. The game, which has gained significant traction online in recent days, involves a pair of pencils or pens, a sheet of paper, and the invocation of a spirit named “Charlie.” Scores of short video clips, posted mostly by teens, show players shrieking and running out of view when the pencil apparently moves on its own and points to a “yes” or a “no” after they say a phrase inviting the demon. Spanish exorcist Jose Antonio Fortea told ACI Prensa that the so-called #CharlieCharlieChallenge involves the very real, occult practice of “calling on spirits.”  KILLER ROBOTS WILL LEAVE HUMANS UTTERLY DEFENSELESS: Killer robots which are being developed by the US military ‘will leave humans utterly defenceless‘, an academic has warned. Two programmes commissioned by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) are seeking to create drones which can track and kill targets even when out of contact with their handlers. Writing in the journal Nature, Stuart Russell, Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkley, said the research could breach the Geneva Convention and leave humanity in the hands of amoral machines.“Autonomous weapons systems select and engage targets without human intervention; they become lethal when those targets include humans,” he said. “Existing AI and robotics components can provide physical platforms, perception, motor control, navigation, mapping, tactical decision-making and long-term planning. They just need to be combined. “In my view, the overriding concern should be the probable endpoint of this technological trajectory. “Despite the limits imposed by physics, one can expect platforms deployed in the millions, the agility and lethality of which will leave humans utterly defenceless. This is not a desirable future.”  26 PEOPLE TREATED AFTER US ARMY SHIPPED LIVE ANTHRAX VIA FEDEX:  At least 26 people are being treated for potential exposure to deadly anthrax after an Army bio-defense facility in Utah mistakenly sent live samples to private and military laboratories in as many as nine states, including California, and South Korea, officials said Thursday.  ****  ... None of this is normal. It all coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says all these awful things would occur before Christ returns. And only a fool or atheist would scoff and think that these headlines signal a normal, functioning planet. God is screaming at us! Don't disregard it. To be a scoffer or an atheist is foolhardy at this point.  In fact, here's a snippet of what atheistic belief, thinking and principle entails. The following is part of a debate between leading atheist Richard Dawkins and radio host Justin Brierley:  Brierley: When you make a value judgment, don't you immediately step yourself outside of this evolutionary process and say that the reason this is good is that it's good? And you don't have any way to stand on that statement.  Dawkins: My value judgment itself could come from my evolutionary past.  Brierley: So therefore it's just as random in a sense as any product of evolution.  Dawkins: You could say that... Nothing about it makes it more probable that there is anything supernatural.  Brierley: Ultimately, your belief that rape is wrong is as arbitrary as the fact that we've evolved five fingers rather than six.  Dawkins: You could say that, yeah.  ... Is this really the crowd of people you want to follow? Whose line of thinking is that rape has no personal or moral violations and connotations behind it? To atheists, rape is just ""Oh well.""   We know rape is wrong deep down. We know murder is wrong deep down. If I were to cleave a baby in two using a sword, 99% of people would react in disgusted outrage on instinct. Why? Because we instinctively know life is precious! It's written on our hearts by God! Morality, logic, and laws aren't human inventions. They existed before humans arrived on the scene. To demonstrate that logic existed before us, wouldn't it be logical to conclude that there were no human beings on earth before we were created? That's logically true! Which means logic existed before we even arrived. Logic (along with morality, reason, etc.) is a faculty that is universal... we didn't invent it and it didn't evolve over time.  Time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, ""You're just being paranoid like all the other inane fundamentalists. Haven't we always had these types of problems?"" Sure... but never at this magnitude. Check the news. The amount of earthquakes, erupting volcanoes, and freak weather events are off the charts! In fact, check activity charts. The increase in activity in just a couple years is eye-opening.  Our planet is screaming at us. The Bible declares that in the Last Days that even the planet itself would be in an uproar. These are called Birth Pangs... not the criminal enterprise known as Climate Change that just wants your money. The planet itself is yearning for the return of its Creator: Jesus Christ.  If you doubt all of this... that's your choice to make, but it's a choice you make at your own mortal peril. The devil himself would want nothing more than for you to keep believing that these warnings are just the senial rantings of a religious sociopath. Because then your soul is his. You let him string you along like a puppet. You drank the Kool-Aid.  Don't let that freak win your soul. Don't let him drag you down into the grave with him. Hell is a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. Miserable and alone. For all eternity. Bill Nye may think hell won't be so bad; he claims he's willing to hold onto his darwinist beliefs even if it means he's hellbound for it. I hope you won't share in that kind of disillusioned thinking...  Accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you're a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His salvation and grace. He's the only way to get out of what's coming. I know you've probably heard ""Jesus loves you"" a trillion times in your life, and it probably just sounds like an empty mantra by now. Or maybe you're wondering, ""How do I know that ONLY Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or Hinduism? What if they're the ones that actually has it right?""  All fair and very valid questions. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with? I encourage you, if you're a skeptic or even an angry atheist, to search out these authors. I'll even list some books of theirs that address just about any issue or question you could have about God:  Frank Turek- Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case  Os Guinness- God in the Dark  Louis Markos- Apologetics for the 21st Century  Norman L. Geisler- Systematic Theology, When Skeptics Ask, I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist, Answering Islam  Lee Strobel- The Case For Christ, The Case For A Creator, The Case For Grace  Ravi Zacharias- The End of Reason, Jesus Among Other Gods, Can Man Live Without God, Has Christianity Failed You?  Philip Yancey- Reaching For The Invisible God, Disappointment With God  These are just some of many books that show the Truth and Existence of God. Or, if books aren't your thing, try the One Minute Apologist right here on youtube. It provides quick answers to tough questions about God.  As I said, time is short. Incredibly short. Earthquakes happening in rapid succession. The beginnings of economic class. Perversion and violence on a rampant scale. The Pope pushing for a One World Order. All of this and more was prophecied by God and is coming true. I hope you'll do yourself a favor and accept Christ as your Savior right away. Or I hope you'll check out some of the resources I mentioned.  Don't let anything stop you from finding God. Don't lose your soul.",0,0,OtterloopB,LTDaET-JweU,0.017354864294202525,2015-07-22 20:40:57,True,True

Shame the Story got completely messed up sometime in Development as well..and that it was just a cheap and nasty Uncharted clone rather than a Proper Third Person Shooter...), Gadgets (finally, its been too long)!, and Action (With Practical Effects!? what Sourcery is this?)! in this trailer? Does this mean we are Finally going to get a Proper Spy Movie again this time?  Or are we in for yet another boring, depressive, Emotional Drama like the last Three Films? I was so disgusted with Skyfall, for example, that I ended up walking out part way through! (I have never done that before, I even watched ""Die Another Day"" to the end!) For Me, Bond just is not Bond in the Recent Films, and was even Worse in Skyfall, as, in my eyes, He was just a Traitorous, emotionally wrecked, Failure! in that film (He failed, every. single, objective), He wasn't even a Man anymore. It got to the point, before I walked out, I was feeling that even Sterling Archer probably would have done a more competent Job!!... I really do Not want to see another James Bond Film of that ilk Again, Three is Three too many for my Tastes!  007, in my opinion is supposed to be a Spy Movie, not an Emotional Drama. Please Stop copying the Bourne (Matt Damon era..the 1988 TV one with Richard Chamberlain was Awesome, as was ""Legacy"" with Jeremy Renner, Those 2 are Spy Movies IMO) and Kindly start copying Kingsman (at least its more '60s inspired elements), Mission Impossible (4 especially) and the very True to the Roots  ""Man From UNCLE"" reboot! The 007 Franchise has only just been kept ticking over for me since the Dire ""Die Another Day"" (which felt more like a Videogame than the Downright Awesome ""Nightfire""...which actually was a Videogame!) with the Games (even if I have hated the gameplay of all the Activision era titles, I Grew Up as a Gamer during the '90's (PC and Consoles at the same time, a rare breed) ,I have got very old school tastes as a result..modern, ""casual"", gameplay just does not appeal to Me), as Bond had a more old school, less emotional, more...""Bond"" personality in them. With the Games seemingly Killed off now, if the next Movie is yet another Emotional-Drama, than the Entire Franchise is just Dead to Me.  This trailer, thankfully, Looks like the Bond Films are thankfully going down the MI4/Kingsman (but 12A rather than 18) /UNCLE style ""Classic Spy Movie"" direction...i Just hope the Film lives up to that Promise . As I am going to be pretty Upset if they get my hopes of one last ""real"" Bond film up like this and it turns out to be yet another Bourne Inspired Emotional- Drama.   Please! No ""Personal Issues"", No ""Emotional Wreck"" rubbish, No ""Doubts"", No ""Main Bond Girl who is Bonds Equal"" again (we have had that one since Liscence to Kill, and I am personally Sick of it! for Me the Hugely Intelligent yet Sweet, Timid, Damsely (and very possibly Autistic, she shows a Lot of Signs of Aspergers) version of Natalya from ""Goldeneye:Reloaded"" was the best Bond Girl in Years! She was certainly the best bit of that cheap and nasty ""Cry On Doody"" copy!), no Failed Objectives. No Balderdash!. Just Lots of Cool Cars, lots of Cool Gadgets, plenty of attractive Women, tonnes of one liners, a successful mission, and a 100+ Mook Bodycount ,or this franchise really is Dead to Me.

2015-07-24T04:17:06,"Isn't this the last time Daniel Craig's playing Bond? I must admit, when he started I was very dubious. Having grown up in the hay-day of Roger Moore as Bond, he represented 007 for me. There hasn't, frankly, been a bad Bond but after seeing Daniel Craig smash it I'll be unhappy to see him wave it away (if this is his last standing). He exceeded my expectations and really smashed it home, very consistently too, I might add.   That being said, who better to share his last hurrah with then Christoph Waltz? That man's a goddamn genius on set, there's not been a role I've seen that he's been in that hasn't been excellent, even during films that were overall lackluster (I.E. Carnage), he still did a stellar onscreen job. Genuinely can't say I've looked forward to a villain's appearance more, Javier Bardem was exquisite, but I think Waltz will top it.   Still, I wonder where Bond will go after this? If this is Daniel Craig's sign off on the Bond role, I'm anxious to see who'll take up the mantle of one of my favourite film franchises. I've heard that dozens of big time, Hollywood heavy hitters are keen on the role and I'd be delighted to see a number of them take on the role, especially Tom Hardy, Damian Lewis, Micheal Fassbender, Tom Hiddleston, Guy Pearce, Henry Cavil and Idris Elba all be potential candidates, but that's just a handful of the lot who've shown major interest. I'd be bucking for Jason Statham but I'm not sure he's got enough of the ""casual"" side before the shooting starts and the car chases begin, though he can definitely pull off the wit. More worrying still is where they'll pull the next villain from. Over the last few films I believe we've seen the pinnacle of them, (not to say there haven't been some excellent performances and memorable villains prior to all this) and they'll be tough acts to improve on.   Still, Daniel Craig, you absolutely rocked this roll and I can't wait to see Spectre in all its glory, really looking forward!",0,0,livingmylifeatmach2,LTDaET-JweU,0.1350975975975976,2015-07-24 04:17:06,True,True

Will it just be a remake of the James Bond film You only live twice, and again what about the Camera work? I mean for instance they didn't do a wide shot as the plane was crashing, and the Camera work needs to be good like in Casino Royale, remember that great wide shot of the DB9 toppling over and spinning and crashing when Bond swerved out of the way in order to not hit the girl, that was GREAT!

2015-07-30T06:14:33,"OK, my take is that there will never be another Connery - Bond, we all need to get past that.  I have accepted Craig in the role, partly because his timing is masterful in delivering subtle irreverence with with cutting edged dry English humor that has been one of the Bond trademarks.  The other reason I have accepted him is that I have reset the character in my head to be a code name and field number where the actual identity is an MI6 best kept secret (if there are any).  The revamp of staff and characters was almost too much to bare in Skyfall, but I'm settling in with the new ""Q"" and the RIP ""M"".  I always had a thing for her taste for Scotch, neat.  She was one tough broad!  I am looking forward to the Spectre reboot.  I just know Christoph Waltz will be someone I love to hate.  Back to Bond; How do you top jumping onto an out of control train which has just been shot to hell and eaten by a 100 ton digger?  By straightening your thrashed suit and tie while ratcheting your neck back into place from the whiplash you just got getting there!  That's the kind of sharp edged subtlety I love about the Daniel Craig character.  All the Bonds had character and charm (well, maybe not Dalton).  I would enjoy seeing them do something together on the side, not necessarily as a mainstream Bond but maybe as something where a villian got that secret list of all the operatives' real names and was taking them out one-by-one.  I think it would be cool to see them overlapping wit, charm, audacity, and skills; even as geriatrics to the new guys.  That done with a reasonable budget and good direction, like maybe John Woo, could play out like a serious expendables, only from over the pond.  Might be a hoot!",0,0,Zen Rider,LTDaET-JweU,0.09177666819712273,2015-07-30 06:14:33,True,True

2015-07-31T03:02:42,"The new James Bond film is a high budget one where Skyfall left off from 3 years ago. SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counterintelligence Terrorism Revenge Extortion) it reminds me from the old James Bond film series days starting with Dr. No (1962), From Russia With Love (follow-up) from 1963, Thunderball (1965) now at 50 years, You Only Live Twice (1967) the revealing of SPECTRE #1 Ernst Stavro Blofeld with a white Persian Cat on his lap. Blofeld did hijacked two spaceships on accusing the U.S. and Russia of extortion that led 007 and Japanese Secret Service agent Kissy Suzuki to an underground tunnel inside of a remote volcano outside of Tokyo, Japan where Blofeld and SPECTRE are located at and their remote volcano was later self destructed and blew up by Blofeld after 007 unlocked the exploder button and blew up SPECTRE's spaceship and stopped at 5 seconds left and went not imminent by the U.S. avoiding from a war with Russia. Two years later 007 was married to Tracy after 007 blew up Piz Gloria and Blofeld's laboratory outside of Bern, Switzerland while Blofeld was using his mind control on those girls to commit counterterrorism and Tracy later died in 007's arm after she was assassinated in a drive by was by both Blofeld and his henchwoman Ferline Bunt by the end of the movie was entitled On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). In 1971, Sean Connery returned to play 007 one last time and later donated his money to charity after Connery did The Anderson Tapes and the previous film was The Molly Maguires. 007 did seek revenge on finding Blofeld, But, They had Blofeld lookalikes who isn't The Real Ernst Blofeld. But. The Real Blofeld was in Las Vegas, Nevada after 007 paired up with Tiffany Case whom they've met in Amsterdam, Holland disguising under his alias known as Peter Franks to find the real diamonds where Blofeld had it in his possession and use it as a laser satellite along with a coded cassette tape to destroy a Russian submarine, a rocket ship in North Dakota and a Chinese Army Camp in China and also Blofeld was disguising his voice as Willard Whyte using a voicebox to disguise his voice over the phone and the real Willard Whyte was held locked in a cold storage and got him out of there and the British Intelligence did fire at Bert Saxby after 007 disguising his voice as Bert Saxby on the phone. 007 has to give Q a ton of credit on inventing a voicebox which was originally made for his kids from last Christmas. But, 007 found Blofeld in a Oil Field in Baha California, Mexico at the Pacific Ocean where Blofeld controls a laser satellite after launching his rocket and converted into a laser satellite dish outside planet earth. Also 007 did switch the cassette tapes from coded cassette and switched with a marching music cassette tape in a coded tape machine.",0,0,Mr. Lonnie Booker,LTDaET-JweU,0.02292441792441792,2015-07-31 03:02:42,True,True

No Bond girl I'm mean JB needs his squeeze. not enough quips and corny jokes and why should we give a shit about his backstory if he works in the MI6 or 5 ( I can't remember which one) it would have been erased and all that hoarsecrap about Scotland and his dad were not meant to care about his dad were meant to care about the urgent plot.the Baddie in skyfall was a memorable sleezbag like all the villains should be good on the director for choosing a good villain (credit were credit is due).

That's how the movies go. Roll with it and just enjoy it. Movies are made for an escape from reality",3,1,Aasiyah Wadee,LTDaET-JweU,0.45000000000000007,2015-10-27 18:31:04,True,True

2015-10-28T09:00:39,"Whenever I see the trailer for Specter, I am reminded of these spy films have completely run out of ideas, whether it be James Bond, Mission Impossible, Bourne, or whatever.   It is sort of like watching World Wrestling Entertainment priming us for the next PPV the same way every time. *No, this time it is even more personal for Bond. No, THIS villain was behind everything, forget the last. This time Bond is even more on the run than before. This time his agency REALLY hates him.*  ""It was me, James.""  *yawn*  These franchises are so intent on outdoing each other by making it more 'personal', by making the new villain be the most hated baddie, by having their agencies not side with them... that they are parodying themselves.

2015-10-28T23:04:47,"As somebody who ranks Daniel Craig as the WORST of the Bonds hands down (sorry for those of you get hurt feelings from that due to thin skin), I have to say that this particular trailer (not the other Spectre trailers, though) actually give me a bit of hope for this one.  I will actually go see it with an open mind thanks to whoever edited this particular trailer.  I thought Casino Royale was a great Bond film (nowhere near the best, not even close, but still very, very good; then again, I'm not a Dark Knight fan and those who like Craig's films seem to be hardcore Dark Knight nut swingers so it's no wonder we differ in opinion on Craig's Bond films for the most part).  Unfortunatley, I have grown to despise Craig in the role since his very promising first outing.  He's simply a one note Bond and a very uninteresting one at that.  He lacks so much that makes Bond an interesting character, the most obvious being wit and ingenuity (Craig's Bond is just a brooding hulk who simply reacts instead of THINKING and using quick wit and cleverness which is what made Bond stand out from other action heroes) and of course a strong and likable personality (Craig's a zombie Bond).  Those who say he's more like what a real spy would be are off their rockers.  A real spy would fit in and be totally inconspicuous with nobody even knowing he was there or what he did.  He'd either have to be so nondescript that nobody would notice him or he'd have a friendly personality where everybody liked him and wouldn't think of him as an espionage expert.  Craig's Bond is a brooding hulk with anger management and mommy issues.  He'd stand out like a sore thumb on any security guard's radar.  Apart from disliking Craig as Bond, the films themselves have been terrible as far as plot, storytelling, suspense, and action executiion.  I haven't felt on the edge of my seat in a Bond film since Craig got hit in the nuts over and over again in Casino.  They came close in Skyfall with Bond hanging from an elevator, but they cheated the end of the scene by not showing how he got to safety and simply cutting to him brushing himself off while on safe ground (that was a major missed opportunity).  Maybe that's what today's PC emo audiences like, just straight ahead forward action like the demo of a video game, but this old school movie fan likes ""how's he gonna get out of this seemingly impossible situation"" scenarios and those have been sadly lacking during Craig's era.  Still, this trailer seems to be mixing a lot of the old (almost to the point of rip-off) with the new ""melodrama"" that modern fans jizz over.  This mixture just might make for a film that's close to Casino Royale.  That one had too much past Bond backlash for my tastes, but was faithful to the story overall which is why it succeeded (plus it had great locales and felt fresh at the time).  This one seems to embrace some of the old while maintaining much of the new which could be wise.  Still, what has Barbara Broccoli got against casting drop dead gorgeous women in the latest Bond films.  It's ragged and weary sticks versus our old bombshells, another HUGE minus in direction.  I don't think I'll be back onboard the Bond train in full until they go back to embracing Bond as the character he's been made out to be for decades with great success (I like every single Bond actor apart from Craig whom I liked in Casino Royale but who brings nothing to the role now; that's a sure sign that something is wrong with him not the viewer since none of the other actors were clones of each other yet they were all unequivocally James Bond and not just another tough guy action hero).  Yeah, sod on Craig's Bond, but fingers crossed that Spectre at least gets back to Casino Royale territory as far as story and locales go.",0,0,elfhermie,LTDaET-JweU,0.09713281352485895,2015-10-28 23:04:47,True,True

First things first: 'Writings on the wall' fully heard now, but it just doesn't work, not even with the otherwise wonderful opening credits. And I thought her role would be bigger, total waste of Monica Bellucci, wasn't quite convinced with the Madeleine Swann-plot either.  The film itself, was really, really great. Started with a bang, spiced with a little humor, had an old-fashioned Bond-feel and it ended with a high note. Not the way I excepted, but still with a high note, I'm curious to see how they continue from here.

2015-10-31T09:52:02,"I've seen this movie today. Excellent. I'm just warning you that this comment is a spoiler alert. Only read it if  you've already seen the movie. So the opening scene was brilliant. And then Dave Bautista shows up in a meeting, severely injuring a member and then someone else comes in and sights Bond in the crowd above them and chases after him with pistols and he makes a getaway with his Aston Martin car when suddenly Dave Bautista shows up in his car and they have a chase right beside the London river and Bond uses a flamethrower hidden inside his car and spots a ramp and ejected his seat before parachuting down safely. Then he travels to Austria and finds a house in the middle of nowhere. He finds a mirror which has a secret basement behind it and finds an old man. Bond tries to make a deal with him to protect his daughter no matter what, but it doesn't end up very good. The man sadly commits suicide. Then Bond finds a plane and flies it to the late man's daughter's work building. Suddenly, Dave Bautista shows up and kidnaps her and Bond gets his plane and chases Dave Bautista's vehicle. It ends with explosive action and Bond takes the girl to North Africa hoping she'll be safe. They book a train to go on (I don't know where though!) but suddenly, and I mean suddenly, Dave Bautista shows up yet again but this time he fights Bond and the girl but especially Bond! He tries to throw Bond out of the train but fails when Bond successfully throws Dave Bautista out. But then I think they got kicked out the train so they were waiting for another train to swing by. Then they sighted a very old car driving in there direction. The polite driver let them in and took them to a base in a meteor crater. The men took them to a strange building which had a meteor placed in side it. It was said to be the exact meteorite that created the crater. Then they take Bond and the girl to a control room. They play the video of the girl's father committing  suicide. Bond tells the girl to look at him because the footage was violent, graphic and scary. Then because of that, they hit Bond with a gun before knocking him out. Bond wakes in a chair. The man who is the leader of the company, has a small drill inside the chair which he used to drill his forehead, neck and very nearly his eyeballs. But before that nearly occurred, Bond told the girl to come near him and he gave the girl a bomb which she used to injure about 4 people. They they make a getaway with an pulse rifle and a submachine gun which he at least killed 6 people. He also used a pistol to blow up an explosive object which caused a massive, and this time I mean massive, explosion. When they thought it was finished, it ignited another bomb which caused another big explosion. Then they travel back to London when they go for a drive. But suddenly, another villain appears and crashes Bond's car. The villains kidnap Bond when taking him to a building when outside, Bond grabs a gun and shoots the villains before snapping his handcuffs. Then he goes on a rampage killing all the villains when he comes across a villain with a forcefield in front of him. When he gets closer to the forcefield, he realises it was a villain that he encountered before, (I think although I don't know who!) He has a bloody scar on his eye and that eye is blinded. He sets up a bomb that will demolish the whole building in 300 seconds.  Bond hears yelling in the walls when he finds out they kidnapped the girl! She gets out and trusts Bond to fall on a net which was à stunt btw and then they get a speedboat to run away in while the villain gets a helicopter. They both survive the demolition but suddenly Bond shoots the helicopter which caused it to crash. Bond was about to shoot him but he told him that he's got other things to do.

He said something to the fact, he would rather be stabbed in the eye than do another bad film... or something to that effect. I thought he was being critical of his performance or abject about the Bond franchise future, but now I know what he was trying to convey.Absolutely horrible!I haven't read anything  about his contracts or casting offers, but I truly believe there is no chance of ever seeing Craig in another Bond film or possibly a similar role.",0,0,Marty M,LTDaET-JweU,-0.17561728395061726,2015-11-09 03:02:19,False,True

The only enjoyable scenes were when Bond was alone, with the little gang at HQ (and the gangs escapades separately) and the car chase. That's about it. When it ended it didn't leave you with a WOW. Casino royale and skyfall were superior. They need to stop pairing him with such young actresses too. Bond does not need to be attached like they've shown him. I'm afraid they will ruin the whole story if they continue like they have. All in all it was a disappointment. such a hype around nothing. The little things do matter in these films and if they'd made changes to the cast slightly and made the story more interesting it would've been good. Batista was useless in this film.

2015-12-06T17:05:23,"I really liked this one, even though I was thwarted by the previews showing the main villain, which seems ridiculous for a trailer to do, unless the villain isn't already know. The lurking behind the shadows really creates a special imagery that can bring audiences to the theater rather than already knowing what to expect. What I didn't expect from this movie was the amazing artistic scenes that really fed some emotional charisma. The cultural feel of the James Bond movies has always carried itself well. The opening scene and the day of the dead celebration really showcased a fun experience outside of Bond itself, still keeping with the secrecy elements, and the masquerade behind the masks. The scenes of Rome were also well done especially where even a small glimpse of Monica Bellucci, her scene was pivotal in a cinematographic sense which really captured well a strong feeling of strange within this society that is silent but yet coming together in around the columns of Rome. The lighting of the walking scene as well previously the funeral scene with the slow string build up of feeling that aroused a tension of the two main characters as well bellucci's almost Contrapossto singularity. The viewers sense of awe being entangled with many amazing touches. This is all very interesting to me in that sense.   The action scenes especially the fighting scenes were done well in the sense that it was a brutal finish which didn't entertain James Bond magic too much, but a rugged throw down which was logically fit to show how it could be done. That being said the escape scene disappointed me a bit in that sense which didn't flow through the same continuity of how to actually escape but ended up being more a James Bond magical get away. All in all this was a really awesome film, but it's not without it's questions and disappointments, which I could mention more, only you should check it out for yourself.
