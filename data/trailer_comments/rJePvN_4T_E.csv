Like the second movie could be Operation Torch or El Alimein (something in the Western Desert Campaign) Then the Third movie could be Overlord and possibly the push into Germany.",0,0,Godzilla52,rJePvN_4T_E,0.19722222222222222,2016-08-05 04:02:35,True,True

Gen von Rundstedt was livid because he could have easily and completely annihilated all allied troops on Dunkirk but was not allowed to by the suspicious Hitler.

I don't believe it's fair to judge Styles acting when the movie hasn't even been released, there's still a year to go, and I also can't judge his acting because this is film debut. Christopher Nolan has a pretty good track record of getting good ensemble casts together, look no further than Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy.

Harry may be a big name in music, but he's really nothing in the acting world......yet, anyway.

2016-12-23T12:00:18,"So many stupid comments below about french being cowards or British running away etc etc. Everyone was caught out by naked German aggression in Poland. The allies weren't preparing for war, they were in appeasement mode so their armies were psychologically unprepared for Blitzkrieg. Dunkirk was an example of rescuing a disastrous situation and transforming it into a lucky escape through the courage of all arms of the services, in particular the navy and the French and British rearguard who enabled the operation. The airforce also played a significant role, far from the beaches breaking up German attacks as best they could. The royal navy took more casualties in the 9 days of the evacuation than the Australian navy took in the whole of WW2. Dynamo was a highly successful operation, which, in the circumstances was something of a miracle. The debacle that lead to it had many causes, not the least was the capitulation of Belgium without warning the allies thus completely exposing the entire British left flank and placing both it and French First Army in danger of encirclement. Huge weaknesses in allied strategy were exposed, but unlike the Germans, the allies learnt form their mistakes. Nazi barbarity would mean that Germany had to leave more than thirty divisions in France to repress resistance movements and the threat of British invasion. This meant that Barbarossa was doomed. Britain's ability to keep and maintain alliances by intervening on their behalf and demonstrating to the world that they were going to fight on meant that despite all Germany's military might it was destined to be one of the shortest lived Empires in history. Once the allies had learnt from the Germans their chief tactical tricks - (finger 4 formation in the air, use of massed rather than dispersed armour, airborne infantry, light bombers in close support of infantry operating as mobile artillery etc) the fight of WW2 though terrible was actually quite brief and totally conclusive. If Dunkirk proves anything it proves how totally dominant British rhetoric, propaganda and intelligence were compared to the Germans. Churchill managed to turn an embarrassing rout into one of Britain's finest hours. Someone mentioned Dresden below. I think saturation bombing was probably a mistake, for both moral and strategic reasons. Tactical use of heavy bombers would have had more impact than area bombing. But....... I do get a bit confused when Germans start getting shirty about it. If you sew the seed you reap the whirlwind. Or think of it as Karma-  when massed rallies in Germany were singing ""We are bombing over England"" and the German airwaves were gloating over the destruction wreaked on Rotterdam and London , the British were listening in. So it's not really reasonable to expect that people who've been attacked, humiliated, and blown up will behave in a generous and thoughtful manner. As the old saying goes - if you don't like the punishment don't commit the crime. The same goes for Japan who make quite a bit of moral mileage out the nuclear attacks. They were dreadful, awful acts of violence. But in 1945 allied forces had been fighting their way up through Asia discovering atrocity after atrocity committed by Japanese troops. Is it reasonable to expect people who've been brutalised to behave rationally? By and large the allies adhered to the conventions of war more closely than the axis powers. Japan was not even a signatory to the Geneva convention. Were the nuclear attacks morally correct - no. Were they understandable?

Weygand agreed to cover the British  retreat ""Operation Dynamo"" organized from Dover by Churchill and Admiral  Ramsey ... from 24 to 26 May the exhausted Germans stopped their  advance, allowing the allies to form a corridor of withdrawal, and one  Perimeter of defense around Dunkerque.  2) 400,000 Allied soldiers were surrounded by 800,000 Germans. The  French and British navies are regrouping for the evacuation, on May 27  more than 10,000 British are evacuated. Marines  of war are supported by an armada of ""Little Ships"" coming from England  (519) from France (300) of the Netherlands (29) ... 28 May the king of  the Belgians Leopold III capitulates: decision strongly disputed by the  French and British.  3) On 29th May the general attack of the Germans began ... 30,000 French  soldiers, between  2,500 and 6,000 British, and 160,000 Germans were directly engaged in  the battle. The French defenses held firm, led by General Fagalde and  Admiral Abrial. But the British lines quickly disintegrated after the  first skirmishes. The  original order of Dover provided for full participation by the British  in the defense of Dunkirk, an order made evacuation a top priority.  4) Only the Royal Air Force will participate actively in the battle  alongside French  aviation, in an interview with Fagalde and Abrial, British General  Alexander confirms that he can not hire his troops, he adds that ""anyway  his men Are tired ""... Abrial answers that the  mission will be ensured by the French troops alone by the words"" we are  linked to an imperative mission that is to resist until death to save  all the possible French and English personnel of  The bridgehead of  Dunkerque, as long as this goal has not been reached, we will remain  there ""  5) The Tommies then pile up on the beaches, waiting for their evacuation  ... Fagalde  manages to reorganize the defensive device before the Germans take  advantage of the gaping hole caused by the British withdrawal.  Meanwhile,  in the sector of Lilles, 2 heteroclite divisions of the 1st French  Army, commanded by General Molini√©, contain 7 German divisions ...  including 3 elite armored divisions, commanded by General Rommel ... 28  to 31 May this fierce resistance prevents German reinforcements from  advancing towards the coast. In his memoirs of wars W Churchill writes:  Molinie's epic resistance allowed him to evacuate 100000 more men.  6) 30 May: the fighting is now taking place in the heart of Dunkerque,  the city is  under the continuous fire of the German artillery and the Lutwaffe, the  French hold their positions (writes American historian W. Lord)                                                                   Goerg Von  K√ºchler, who commanded the 18th Army of the Whermacht, writes in  his war diary: ""Despite our overwhelming enumeric and material  superiority, the French counterattack in several places, I do not  understand how these struggling soldiers sometimes have 1 against 20,  find the strength to storm. It's amazing.  7) I find in these French soldiers the same enthusiasm as those of  Verdun in 1916, we do  not pierce anywhere and undergo terrifying losses ... with this  extraordinary French resistance, the evacuations reach a peak of  efficiency during these terrible days. On 2 June the last British  soldiers were evacuated. On  the same day, General Janssen, commander of the 12th DMI, died in  battle, which repulsed numerous German assaults from Fort Des Dunes.  Showing an unprecedented heroism, reports a German officer.  8) The last evacuations under the direct pressure of the Whermacht, are  made in  an indescribable chaos ... Fagalde Abrial and the Admiral Platon are  among the last convoys which arrive ""in extremis"" to cross. On 4 June  the last allied ship leaves Dunkirk around 3:45  am. At 10 o'clock the fighting ceased.  9) 35,000 French soldiers who have sacrificed themselves fighting to the  end are  taken prisoner ... Churchill and Ramsey estimated that a maximum of  40000 soldiers could be evacuated during Operation Dynamo ... in the  end it is 198000 men, Almost all of the British professional soldiers,  including the future marshals Alexander and Montgomery who were  repatriated. 140000 French and Belgian were also repatriated, a total of  238226 men. The Royal Navy, which transported 2/3 of the men, lost 112  ships in the operation; The French Navy 123 ships.  10) The city of Dunkerque is destroyed to 90%. There are more than 3000  civilian deaths and 10000 injuries. In 9 days of fighting the allies  lost 18219 men including 16000 French. Operation Dynamo, however, is  considered a victory in Britain. Rescued from Dunkerque, Lieutenant  Bourl√®s of 71√®m RI recounts his passage in England: Having covered the  British embarkation, we were considered  heroes, young people asked for autographs, the officers greeted us with  gratitude.  11) In the hours that follow most of the French soldiers is sent back to  Brest and  Cherbourg in order to continue the battle of France against Germany and  Italy. During these violent clashes Germany lost 160000 men  (as much as during the Normandy campaign in 1944) 1800 German tanks  were destroyed or damaged, and the Lutwaffe lost 50% of its forces,  consequently the Reich would be very weak in the forces In the Battle of  Britain. For  British general Allan Brook: ""difficult to imagine how England could  have continued the war without Dunkirk"" ... For Walter Lord the battle  of Dunkirk is the turning point of the 2nd World War  12) England defeated, Germany could have turned all these forces towards  Russia, Stalingrad and D-Day would not have taken place. ""Dunkirk was a  disaster for Germany"" Von Kl√ºcher writes: ""Dunkirk is a defeat  for us: practically all the British expeditionary force escaped us  because of a few thousand brave French soldiers who blocked us Dunkirk  brings me the evidence that the French soldier is one of the best in  the world ... resisting for 10 days our forces far superior in number,  the French army has probably saved the Great Britain's defeat enabling  its professional army to join the British side  13) In the aftermath of Operation Dynamo British propaganda will invent  the myth of  the ""Dunkirk spirit"" touting the courage of the Tommies in adversity,  the English media will speak with emphasis of the ""miracle of  Dunkerque"", but there was no Miracle, only the courage and the  formidable aptitude to fight of these forgotten French soldiers...",0,0,philippe klopfer,rJePvN_4T_E,0.060180623973727414,2017-07-19 01:46:45,False,True
