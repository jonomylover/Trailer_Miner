God is a source of pure.The bad things comes from satan. When He created us non of these stuff was happening. But then people turned their backs from God because they wanted to follow their path without Him, their creator. I am talking about Adam and Eve. This is a metaphor of course. Adam and Eve was all men and women. Simple people. So in this way the ""doors"" of paradise closed and the ""doors"" of hell opened. Not because God didn't care about us. Because he respected our choise. Because we have the freedom to decide which path we will follow. God wants to help all of us. We are the ones who don't let him. Now if people disagree with me this is my opinion and I  admit that i can't prove anything I just said. The Bible says this stuff and I believe them because I am Christian I want to say.

Looking forward to seeing this movie about faith. Our nation needs a lot of that. I'm voting for the Christian man, even if other Christians complain he's ""wearing his faith on his sleeve."" George Washington wore his faith on his sleeve. Ever since 1962 (when our teachers were leading us in daily prayer; -- in our case The Lord's Prayer), Christians have been increasingly ridiculed as being unscientific. I remember seeing the 1960 move starring Spencer Tracy that made Christians look like dumb, fanatical,  unscientific jerks (INHERIT THE WIND) while failing to disclose that the  bogus evidence of the (1925) Scope trial case was a fraud, a pig's tooth, not the ""link"" between ape man and hu-man.

2016-04-02T02:14:00,"This is a message for anyone that feels like they‚Äôre struggling with sin in their life, or just feel they are struggling in general. Also for skeptics or people who don‚Äôt believe in God at all. Please just give it a read. The least you can do is get more reading in for the day :)   As a Christian, I would never criticize anyone for making decisions that are or lead to sinfulness because I‚Äôve sinned gratefully in my past (I still do today, but to a much lesser degree). I was saved from my sinful life by choosing God‚Äôs will over mine and developing a pure love for others like Jesus showed us. It breaks my heart to see more and more people that feel like they can live without God. I am telling you that if not now, you will eventually find yourself in a place where things are just too hard. At that point you can either turn back to your Creator for strength and direction or fill your life with worldly things just to get through. This is dangerous because those things are usually drugs, alcohol, sex, food, pornography, or rebellion to name a few. These things will ultimately separate us from God even more and destroy our lives while they‚Äôre at it. I know what it‚Äôs like to be practically drowning in sin, but feel totally fine because you have so many worldly things to distract you from the pain. But in the end, you‚Äôll be stuck in a constant search for meaning. The only way to find meaning is through Christ. Believe me, once you ask for forgiveness and let Him into your heart, He will save you from your struggles and you can then live with abundance and fulfillment. The joy God can bring you when you commit yourself to Him is truly unbelievable. I‚Äôm still amazed everyday. I‚Äôd ask you to examine the troubles that plague your life right now. They could be sexual sins, addictions, suicidal thoughts, family problems, people-pleasing, anxiety, promiscuousness, eating disorders, low self-esteem, bitterness, self- harm, depression, crime, jealousy, hopelessness, loneliness- anything. Ask yourself, is my life going to be enjoyable 10 years from now if I don‚Äôt change my ways? Are these ways going to provide for me any of the genuine love God wants to show me?   I‚Äôm not forcing anyone to change or believe in God if they don‚Äôt want to. I just want everyone to be saved like I was saved. I know that some of these worldly things make life easier, heck they may even make it better. But when you have to rely on material things, people included, to feel happy then that‚Äôs not true happiness. True happiness is found in God and God alone. I want all of my brothers and sisters to go to Heaven some day. I also want them to live life abundantly like Jesus promised he can do for us. He surely did for me. You can be saved from an empty life and eternal punishment.   If you want, look up the I AM SECOND Youtube channel. People  share their stories of when they were saved. There are plenty to choose from. I also recommend you read these 3 verses (look them up online if you don‚Äôt have a Bible): Matthew 19: 25-26, Romans 8: 38-39, and John 3:15-17. God Bless all who read this entire thing :) I wish you the best of luck if you chose to seek out the love of God!",1,0,Rach079,CldGTG6iVrU,0.22468181818181818,2016-04-02 02:14:00,False,True

I can personally understand why people would say this. Why would a just and all-loving God have a little girl struggle with such a painful disease?  We believe God himself did not give her this disease. Our world is currently in a fallen state, it is not perfect. In the beginning, it was heaven on earth and every creature lived free from pain and disease. God desired most to give human beings ""free will."" He wanted us to be able to choose him rather than to become his little puppets. However, free will also allowed us to not choose God, which lead to the downfall of humanity, thus also making our world no longer perfect. Because of this, there are unexplained natural disasters and diseases that no one purposefully intended to happen.

That is the cost of life, being able to do and think whatever we want, which is given by God. You people blaming God for all the bad things that happen in the world should thank God for giving you lives, not creating you like robots! Ultimately the cost of life is death, but thankfully God paid the price of death through Jesus so we can be with God. Unfortunately, even though God wants to be with you people, you still reject God. You don't choose to see good in anything or anywhere or show good, but I tell you God loves you and wants to be with you even though you reject God and blame God for the bad things that happen. God still made the sun shine on earth, let the rain fall, let the plants grow so you people can have food on your table, clothes on your bodies, houses to live in so you can survive and help each other and those in bad situations, which is what God wants you to do with your life, not destroy what God made as humans while you complain and blame God when bad things happen. It's the most depressing thing to think of ever, no wonder atheists are in depression. And you know what, people die from depression, too, because it affects your health. So be thankful you're alive because when you're all dead you don't have the ability to complain and blame anymore.",1,0,Hannah Faye,CldGTG6iVrU,-0.04081027667984187,2016-04-13 04:25:38,False,True

That is just the way the the world is. I have a story of my own so just keep that in mind before you choose your backlash, I am not a normal teen and I never had a normal life. My meaning for that is I grow up with a lot of medical problems and my family is not supportive of me in anyway.

2016-07-30T00:49:17,"things wrong with this movie:¬† the children are sent to 'school' a dangerous place that shouldn't exist, to get their government lies and indoctrinations. see 'schools are prisons' here on youtube. No single adult in this entire movie says the word/name 'Jesus', and that's important, because Jesus is God. The adults in this movie barely say 'God', and say it obscurely, as if his name and 'Jesus' are taboo, its pathetic. This is a satanic 'politically correct' movie, notice the clever title 'Miracles from Heaven' if it were titled 'Miracles from Jesus' that would be somewhat of an improvement, but these Hollywood $$$ types even cover theier asses here, by emphasizing 'all's good with 'miracles' example: 'the children's 'miracle' network, if it's even still in existence, the evil false fake pretend 'preacher', Benny Hinn and his 'miracles', sounds like a travelling circus act, and that's just what Benny HInn and his staff of crooks are, criminals, who belong behind bars. Come to think of it, the only time the name/word 'Jesus' was spoken throughout THE ENTIRE movie, which is pathetic, was when Annabel was in boston in the hospital, and she spoke 'briefly' about 'Jesus' to her roommate, haley, who later died from cancer. At this point as a born again Christian myself, I'm still learning just who Jesus is with and who he's not, so I can't say that Jesus was with haley or that he was not, solely based on what I've learned in my experience as a born again Christian. Another thing wrong is the 'church' is people, NOT a building or anyplace in particular. So their being a 'church' building is wrong, sin, pagan, our bodies are God's temples where Jesus dwells, not 'any building'. The early church met in homes and simple places, not until much later when gentiles came along did error come in, and the erection of 'buildings', paganistic were built,¬† and the simplicity/intimacy of small fellowship groups broken up start to fade as a whole, but never stopping altogether. The word 'church' comes from the greek 'ekklesia' and means 'gathering'. Born again Christians can meet anytime anywhere. This paganistic practice of meeting once a week on 'sunday' or 'saturday', 'wednesay' WHATEVER, is not biblical. Jesus said 'where two or more are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.' The 'scheduling' 'planning, etc. time limits are all not of God, the Holy Ghost, God's Spirit moves when and however he wants, and he is the third person of the Godhead, and he is not restricted to 'a hour service' etc. OR ANY TIME, OR ANY THING. It has long been the Laodicean church age for decades upon decades, and the 'churches' are apostate. None are born again in the Laodicean church, it is the 'judas' church, the false church of these last days, and all that are a part of 'this church' are not born again. God has always had his true born again Christians, and still does, even though they are the minority, but it's always been that way. Then we have 'pastor dumbass' let me point out that all these 'churches' today, - Laodicean, are filled with unsaved people, who many 'think' they're saved, but they're not, including 'the pastor' so here in this movie, we have this dumbass clown pastor, making stupid jokes up there on the platform, that's all he can do, he's a complete jackass, he doesn't even know the bible, all these Laodicean 'churches' are nothing more than social clubs, -Jesus is not there, he left them a long long time ago, and he's not welcome now, so if you're a born again believer on fire for God, you too would not be welcome in these piece of crap social clubs. We belong out in the world, amongst sinners, like Jesus did, not among people who are self righteous, and in love with themselves, and a 'god' they think is the true God, but in fact, their 'god' is satan. This is why so many are deceived, because satan comes as an 'angel of light' to deceive, and his ministers also. People are deceived because they're not born again and they don't know what the Word of God, -the bible says. Thus, they end up following all manner of false doctrines, teachings, and find themselves in a terrible mess that only Jesus can free them from. So we have this asshole up on stage clowning around with people in pews-which a terribly uncomfortable, he's being a typical asshole, when what he should be doing and what the people need is the strong meat of God's Word. Which is just like 'soul surfer' 'heaven is for real' and all these lame pathetic 'movies'. I don't know if Bethany Hamilton is born again or not. She uses a corrupt perverted satanic 'bible'. The only bible that is God's Word for English is the 1769 king james bible; Cambridge edition. And Carrie Underwood was a pathetic joke in that movie, and seems like a dumbass in real life also, full of herself. When Annabel was about to tell her mom (Jennifer Garner) in the movie that 'it was Jesus who told her she'd be fine' they instantly cut away to having Annabel tell her parents out in the yard at the picnic table what happened to her, once again, THE ACTORS-DIRECTORS-ETC whoever was responsible-involved, PURPOSELY avoiding the name above all names, 'JESUS', probably because they can't give glory to God, oh sure, they BARELY mention the name 'God', BUT they dare not say 'Jesus is God', which he is, because most if not all of them say they believe IN THE IDEA of 'God', but they certainly do not believe that Jesus is God, which the bible clearly teaches that he is. So Annabel proceeds to 'alledgedly' tell what happened to her which totally contradicts the bible. Once she was out of her body, she's dead. The bible says it is appointed unto man once to die - ONCE TO DIE, and after this the judgment. Then it shows her supposedly in heaven, which is another biblical contradiction-we only know of heaven what the bible tells us. Anything else is a lie/speculation and contradicts the bible. And once you're in heaven, you're there! There's no coming back to earth-no where in the bible is this taught. So this girl Annabel is lying/exaggerating, or just plain doesn't know-remember-is confused. Anything that happens that doesn't line up with scripture is FALSE.",0,1,David David,CldGTG6iVrU,-0.07141534391534392,2016-07-30 00:49:17,False,False

2016-10-16T09:03:16,"I just want to say that I watch this movie and it touched me and moved me. So many of us who have children never stop to think how lucky we are to have healthy and happy kids. When we see our children having a good day rather it being playing with other friends, soccer, entertainment, etc. stop and say a silent prey in your head thanking Jesus for dying on the cross and giving us all life and our healthy child's life and then pray for those who aren't so lucky that some how they will find God and peace. We have a Great God who is loving and merciful and although we may not understand why things happen the way they do, know that God has a plan and his plans are always for good. Through this little girl's illness and then her testimony and miracle healing, this movie was created. So that many others who perhaps don't know Jesus will come to find him and those who do know him will come to realize just how fortunate they are to have him in there life.   P.S. God does reach out to people in many ways. My boyfriend who knew of God had an experience too just like the little girl in the movie and my boyfriend got taken to a mountain where he spoke to Jesus and there was a bright light over head that he believes was God. The conversation was about his self worth as a person. Jesus loves my boyfriend and my boyfriend needed to know that Jesus is real and loves him because sometimes we don't love ourselves and think that God doesn't either but that is not true just a lie from the enemy. Worthiness is not something we have to concern ourselves with because Jesus took care of that on the cross and we don't have to do works to be worthy. All we need to do is realize what Jesus did for us and know how much he loves us and want to have him in our life and heart.

The closest thing to Christianity mentioned was ‚ÄúChurch,‚Äù so I would conclude by saying that the film was tailored to appeal to people of all faiths, as any ‚ÄúGod‚Äù would easily fit the criteria.

It took that hard of a hit on the head to dislodge the thing, as she had to be fully unconscious not just sleeping or sedated in hospital for an exam using Benzodiazapine ""twilight anaesthesia"" - perhaps it was even the impact itself which overwhelmed her superhuman willful retention of intestinal gasses. And when describing this event to her parents, she spoke of ""the butterfly"" - well this was the butterfly in her STOMACH you see. This also explains her description of touching the butterfly and sensing flowers all around her, at her fingertips, and seeing a white light etc. No doubt her smother had described lady-toots as ""smelling like flowers"", though of course the girl's smother herself had never farted in front of her daughter, instead doing as a good woman does she held her pressurized and refined gasses in reserve until such time as she was alone in the house and all the neighbors were at work & school etc, after she had carefully & silently opened all of the windows and tied the curtains back in their colour-matching sashes. Naturally as such, the child had learned, as all of her female relatives before her back into antiquity indeed back into the antidiluvian times just a little over four thousand years ago, had each learned from their own smother - to believe that women don't pass gas.

The difference being that Chloe's issue was ""Hardware"" & this little girl's issue was ""Software""; or at least that's how I explain it...

And it wasn't just the similar illness or the test in faith that got the most out of me... It was near the end of the movie when they reflected back on the PEOPLE, the LOVE and SUPPORT and PRAYERS that came from their Friends and Family and Total Strangers...

2017-12-10T08:56:14,I will be honest.  I am raised in a christian family but I was never a strong believer. Most of the time I would even think God's not real and I doubted him. but one fine day when I stepped over my baby kitten and she was literally lying dead. I prayed so hard. I prayed and prayed for her to be fine. I remember weeping so badly and never ever in my life have I prayed like that. I kept the cat back at her room and I fell asleep..I woke uo the next day and hoped for whatever was to happen. When I entered the room I saw her running towards me all healthy and happy. I was so thrilled and so happy and the first thing I did was thank God for the miracle. because in no way did I think my kitty would survive. she was panting and closing her eyes that I thought I'd lose her. It was that when I realise that when you have true faith in God. he will answer your prayer.,0,0,roe becks,CldGTG6iVrU,0.20694444444444446,2017-12-10 08:56:14,False,False

""Faith, muricals(southern accent), and luv...and hope."" When you learn it was backed in production by prosperity Oneness(Jesus-only cultist) T.D. Jakes...for most educated Christians... that was the red light of a false gospel. The girl goes to all doctors and none can heal her. She falls into a tree(similar to the tree from the original 1981 Tobe Hooper film Poltergeist), where she goes into a transcendalist delusion. Mind you, she has a pure Hinduist out-of-body experience with ""god."" Full of good chakras, kundalini worship mixed with the latest Pearl Jam/Creed impersonating contemprary pop-rock. It's a mix of New Age, Hinduism, Anglican, pseudo-Christian science, and secular feel-good philosphy. The story holds no credibility as this same give faith get miracles(give a seed of faith for $1,000 god will give you your miracles) gospel holds no ground to any true Christian. 1st world, lukewarm, religious white-washing and holds a recycled fable of miracles via faith-healing as all ""good"" multi-million ""christians"" like T.D.

2018-12-16T22:18:14,"I am going to make some comments here, and before I really say any thing, I am going to say that I am a christian. Jesus is God. And the bible is the measuring rod. Jesus is the Lord. I seen this movie a while ago, and I am thankful to God for testimonies, and miracles, and what ever Jesus is doing amen to that. Thank God for that. And thank God that this girl was ok, and was healed by God.  But seeing this movie, I felt so dissatisfied with the lack of scripture, and the lack of understanding that it brought to people. People have so many questions about the bible, and about God, and because many people don't understand the things that are in the bible, they don't come to God.  The bible says, my people perish for lack of knowledge, and the bible says, you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. And the bible says to get knoweldge, and to get understanding.  And the bible says, to always have an answer for the hope that is in you. And maybe the people that made this movie just simply did not know what the bible says about these topics. But it just seems like to me, that there is sooo sooo soooo much more that could have been said.  And some things that were not said rightly at all.  Like where the mother was asked about sins in their family and she got offended. The bible says many will be offended, so you can be sure this is some thing that the devil is going to try to use, offense.  I can see that more and more there is this effort in the spirit, with demons, to silence people. Just to stop them from talking freely. But the bible says, where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom.  And unless some topic is going to make some one stumble, like some sexual topics may make some men stumble...then any thing I think, other than that should be fair game. There needs to be open discussion in the church, and there needs to be open discussion with people that are not part of the church.  any ways, I want to get to some thing specific. So she was asked about sin in her family, or some thing like that, but then she was offended and walked out.  The right response should have been, show me where I am wrong from the bible.  And you know what those ladies in that show brought up was biblical.  Who was the man that was healed, who was brought through the roof, and Jesus said take up your mat and walk, you sins are forgiven? And then some said, who can forgive sins but God? But Jesus answered them and said, what is easier to say, your sins are forgiven? or take up your mat and walk? So in the mind of God, forgiveness of sins, and healing and one and the same. And that is what these ladies understood, and wanted to get to, I think, to address the sin, that it might be stopped, and forgiven, and that this girl might have been healed.  But the mother took it personal, and was offended, and cut off communication, and this was the wrong move.  People have got to get over the fact that the truth is hard. Truth is not defined by feeling good, or looking pretty. Some times truth is hard. You have bills, and your bank account is empty, well do you say, it seems to bad to be true?  People need to seek the truth, not based on how good or bad it seems on the surface of the story. But they need to look to prove if it is really so or not.  Every christian should be looking to the bible often to see if they measure up. Every christian should be increasing in knowledge and understanding. Every christian should be looking for any thing that could be an excuse for demons to reside in their house, like having some thing stolen. Or having non christian music...I think some people need to pray about that, and also look up John Todd and Rebekka brown.",0,0,Shane Bob,CldGTG6iVrU,0.11816893424036283,2018-12-16 22:18:14,False,False
2018-12-16T22:23:31,"I would really encourage every person that wants to know about healing, and how it works biblical...I speak of supernatural healing, to look up Kenneth E Hagin - The ABC's of bible faith. And I would encourage them to study the bible on the subject, and to look in Hebrews chapter 11.  So many people think that healing should just be all automatic, well if God wants to heal me He will. God is sovereign, He is a sovereign being...But what would happen if the sinner said, if God wants to save me He will?  They would die and go to hell.  God has already done every thing for healing, and for salvation. Its up to men to learn what they need to do, and yes they do have a part to play. Faith is the currency of heaven. Men need to know what faith is, and what faith is not. And they need to know how to get faith, and how to use their faith.  If you don't know these things, you need to learn about them. And you should be able to explain from the bible what these things are. There is certainly a war on language these days, that the devil is waging on christian words, that men might not understand. I know there is many christian words that are becoming movie titles that are not linked to the meaning of the word, in any way what so ever. But its a detraction technique to make people think of the movie, and not what christians will tell them, when christians will be explaining some thing.",0,0,Shane Bob,CldGTG6iVrU,0.22802197802197804,2018-12-16 22:23:31,False,False
