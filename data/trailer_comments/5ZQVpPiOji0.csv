""Wild,"" which I also read, was pretty much a therapy session for women.  ""A Walk in the Woods"" which is a GREAT book was a joke of a movie. ""Wild"" was just silly.  But I saw Everest last night. While it's not the book because it doesn't come from the author's perspective, I found it absolutely riveting and the closest thing to capturing the power of nature and the suffering that can come from being in it. It blew my mind that the theater was about 2/3 empty. It seemed to have just enough ""Hollywood"" drama to hook the typical audience member but enough specifics for those looking for realism.  HIGHLY recommend this film.  At the very least, I sure hope that it puts an end to the bullshit people spew from their couches whenever there's a tragedy about how ""anyone can climb Everest"" and that Sherpas ""drag people up the mountain."" That really pisses me off because it's nothing but pure garbage. 98% of people couldn't make it to base camp.
