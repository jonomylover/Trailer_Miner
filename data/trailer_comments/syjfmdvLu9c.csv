SEX EVERYWHERE.While I find the setting to be an interesting twist what really killed it for me when I saw the girls sexualizing themselves up by making alterations to their clothes.Now I know that running around in a very long dress would life hazard for some women, especially with the situation the characters are in. However, I find it very stupid to expose parts of your body ( arms, shoulder, legs and chest ) when fighting monsters that have the ability to zombify a person by exchanging FLUIDS upon contact. The last time I checked, in the zombie mythos, a person could become a zombie by either being scratched, biting, or from blood contact from another zombie.High School Of The Dead also has the same problem.I'm no feminist or anything, I think its annoying and illogical to have women or men dress up in a sexualize way when to plot revolves around action and bloodshed.",0,0,Krystal Ortiz,syjfmdvLu9c,-0.1665,2016-01-11 21:55:57,True,True

Maybe the rules are that every single person must know how to fight, and always be prepared if/when they are faced with an undead. Even during parties, which could be their way of living instead of just surviving. And when a girl gets married, she is probably expected to give up her responsibility of battle in exchange for raising, teaching, and protecting whatever children she bears (repopulating the human race and making sure they live to be strong adults and all that jazz). I'm not saying that the movie will be good, I'm just saying that the story has the potential to not be ridicules.
