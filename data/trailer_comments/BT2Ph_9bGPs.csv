They are the ones that are clearly portrayed as scheming, jealous, petty, and cruel. But let's not lose sight of the fact that this is a STORY.  Anyone that watches a movie, reads a book, etc. and just automatically takes it to be true is an idiot. It's a given that this story is BASED on a true story, is told from mainly one POV, and clearly doesn't have the capacity to be accurate in every way. You want to know what really happened between England and India, then please check out multiple, reliable NON-FICTION sources. It's true that it's a somewhat light-hearted story set in a time/place that had a lot of terrible things going on (it's also true that the movie is no particular masterpiece).
