I had never seen visuals like the ones contained in those comics. Needless to say I was completely and utterly hooked from the moment I saw it. I first heard about James Cameron acquiring the rights to Battle Angel Alita when I turned 16 from a now defunct website called ""The Upcoming Movie List"". I'm 36 now. 20 years I've waited for this to happen and I cannot even begin to tell you the surprise and excitement I felt when watching the first trailer.

So this isn't actually Sci Fi at all it's Science Fantasy.  They might have been better to bare that mind when making this to show she fineses her victories. Other wise it's a bit to much like expecting a 7 year old child to realistically beat up a pro wrestler.   The CGI flip flops a bit to close to uncanny valley at times too. so much so that (like Valarian) it looks like a cartoon with live action element and so has more in common with Detective Pikachu or who framed roger rabbit.   That said - what there is - seems stronger than the visual catastrophe of Valarian or Ready Player One. Though I expect the battle scenes will be a CGI Sh**show where you can't tell what is going on at any point. I may watch it though But I'm expecting ""Meh"" not 'great'. (if because Hollywood has 'Meh' as a it's default setting).

Yes, it's weird but that's the point. It's a robot, and I'm glad they added something unrealistic to show that. One thing I had problems with robot movie over these years that they look so human and feel so unnatural that they say it's a robot. It's lazy for studios give us an actor by themselves and say it's a robot machine don't forget that. They tell us but not show us. But this movie at least shows us a way that she's a robot and not look like everything like us.

It was absolutely awful from start to finish... it picked up a rough 51% on metacritic and is currently at 60% on rotten tomatoes as of now, it's went up slightly but even still that's not positive really at all, and honestly I see why it got that. It had the potential to be amazing, alita was such a likable character and she wasn't annoying, there were also so many good actors. I feel like the only good thing that actually came out of this movie was the action and the overall CGI. It was sloppy, the plot was terrible and most of the scenes where just upright cringe. It could have been amazing, but it was terrible. I went to watch it with 7 people, and everyone felt the exact same way as me. I even heard someone mutter a 'Jesus that was awful' to their friend walking out haha. Sure, everyone has their opinions, but I am with the critics on this one... very dissapointed with it if I'm honest. Big let down.  Spoilers!!!

2019-02-14T04:53:51,"Movie is AWESOME!!! Still, I can't help commenting about people complaining about Alita's character being CGI with big anime eyes. They should know that it is the best decision that the production team did for this movie. Why?  1. She is NOT NORMAL, so why must she look like a normal human being. Past anime-to-movie adaptations are disappointing because their actors do not look close enough to the manga/anime characters. They are just too normal for that role.  2. To pay homage to the source material. Alita's eyes were also pointed out in the manga. So if the creators promise to stay true to the manga, they definitely should show that through the heroine.  3. If you watch the movie, the anime eyes is a distinct feature of ""her kind"". Meaning it is to differentiate Alita and her kind from the human beings.  4. Necessary for future sequels. Alita should look young, doll-like, and vulnerable. This is why villains underestimate her. The movie alone is almost 3 yrs in the making. If there will be 3 or more sequels (I really wish there will be), that's a lot of years of filming and the lead actress should look the same within 10 yrs or more. Don't get me wrong, Rosa Salazar is beautiful and perfect for the role, but to achieve all of the characteristics I mentioned previously, CGI is the only way to go.  So if you want to watch it, just watch it, it will not disappoint. Most of the people who watched the movie love it and that should be enough proof that it's good. I wish those naysayers will stop saying things they know nothing of, like they know better than the author Yukito Kishiro who approves the movie, the production team and the anime/manga fans.

I just felt like they spent too much time in the film exploring the world (which I loved, but could have been paced better) and left very little runtime to the actual plot. This made the plot rushed and character development for other supporting characters half-assed (like Chiren's change of heart, which gave me whiplash because she showed no indication of it at all until it actually happened). I thought they could've split this movie into 2 and paced it all out better, and give themselves more room to explore the unique world. May have been better to end the movie after the battle with Giwenska (sp?) and keep the audience in suspense to Alita's well-being till the next movie.

2019-02-17T21:16:40,"To rate the quality of a movie, based on more then legendary original material, is similar to trying to explain and define quantum physics. How can one even try, if even the original material has countless diverse interpretations on its meaning and essence? In fact, I haven't yet had the pleasure to see for my self, but the indicators for highest quality movie making, at least by todays standards are not so bad for this release.   It is produced by renowned producers,  not only having produced some of the true classics of the scifi genre, but also having directed some of them. I personally never liked Avatar, but that is personal opinion, and far from objective. But Aliens is a classic at its own rights, not as good as Alien, but what is? But still a more than a decent follow up, 2010 can not tell the same story here, for instance.  Despite from that, we have producers here with a financial background suitable to pull a production as this of on their own, not having anyone pull the strings in the back, like some crazy german fond fed by chinese or russian, stupid rich no names.  And we see one of the finest directors of today, one of the few with the guts to deliver his beliefs in entirety having directed this movie.  And still, this will never reach the status of being a classic. But it will certainly be an enjoyable film, true as possible to what its makers understood of the original material.

2019-02-18T07:30:44,"jesus i can't understand why there's so many positive comments. THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE. Here's a somewhat (at least I tried) unbiased review:  1) the only good part are the fight scenes, which I will be honest and say that they looked pretty sick  2) there was no backstory or context, which i suppose is fine if you know the comics/manga or whatever, but for me and my friend, we didn't have that background information, so everything was just confusing  3) the pacing was TERRIBLE. I'm not go into too many details because then it'd be spoilers, but everything was just confusing since the beginning. it got better for me as the movie progressed, but my friend HATED the movie  4) the acting was just plain awful. now before people rip me apart, i'm not going to straight up blame the actress because I don't know the actress who played alita, and i don't know if she's a good actor. I do know, however, that everything looked so fake on the screen it was downright laughable. her smile, her acting, everything about her was so stressed. There's this sad scene near the end of the movie (again not going to go into in because spoilers), but where you can tell it was supposed to be sad, the entire movie theater just burst into laughter. I am not even kidding, i could hear people laughing in the theater. It was just awful. there's zero connection to the characters, which is why you can't feel for them. i'm going to be very truthful and say that this movie had the potential to be a good movie despite all its other faults, but one of the main, MAIN reasons it was so terrible was because of the acting. i suppose it might have something to do with the cgi, because i watched a behind the scenes video and her acting looked pretty convincing then.  5) everything good about this movie is in the trailers. I must admit they made the trailers look AMAZING, which was why i was so excited to go see it in the theaters. but everything that's not in the trailers SUCK. they hyped this movie up too much, which makes it an even bigger disappointment when you actually watch it.  6) overall summary: it's not a bad movie to watch when you're EXTREMELY bored and have nothing else to do. the action scenes for one IS pretty lit. But it is definitely NOT something you would want to spend money for tickets. NOT WORTH IT.   no hating. just my opinion.",0,0,Jennifer Lo,cislZ9S0ocA,-0.026808905380333946,2019-02-18 07:30:44,False,True

I find it unbelievable that such a movie would be voted badly/average on rotten tomato's and Box Office, but I heard it's getting better and it is being released in the East and more countries worldwide. The producers are complete geniuses and the graphic designers and editors were phenomenal. If I could, I would donate millions to this movie so it could surmount its production cost as fast as possible. I think I speak for everyone when I say this: There MUST be a sequel.

Need Alita to save me.  One more thing:  Two of my favourite moments are in the first fight scene. #1 is Alita's eyes after she beats the guy to death. When she stands back up. #2 is also Alita's eyes after Grewishka jumps down the hole. When she is standing on the edge looking for him.  Long story short, Alita: Battle Angel is an amazing movie!

What really bothers me is how the western critics treat the movie. 59% critical score and 35% from top critics? While the audience give it 93% approval? This is just mind blowing how out of touch or outright bought out these top critics are.   Want to see something fun? Just look at the glowing reviews the same shills gave to The Last Jedi. Is there still any reason to listen to these pathetic clowns?

2019-10-03T08:13:42,"Actually, I regret that I watched this movie, because I still feel sad and depressed since watched this movie, too sad to see how Alita suffered and cried when lost Hugo. Just remembering her sad face make me cry too. It is really really best movie whenever I have seen any movie in my life, just can not recover, every moment Alita is in my head, very influencing movie.   I read japanese manga at least hoping Hugo will resurrect or survive somehow like Alita survived after 300 years. Honestly, I didn't like other parts of manga, as Alita again come across the same pain, some other boyfriends. I think, everybody wants Hugo to come to life somehow in sequel. May be it is possible to survive after that fall, but Nova told that he is watching everybody, and may be he has kind of memories of Hugo, and after 300 years Mars technology much more developed, Alita's new body kind of sends signal to Mars, and when Alita meets with Nova, and Nova pleads for forgiveness and tells the secret that he has memory of Hugo, then Alita asks his friends in Mars to resurrect Hugo. That's my story. We all REALLY need sequel and see Alita's happy life too. Mr. James must remember that lot of disabled people, kids are also watching it, giving some power and strength, so they also REALLY expecting their HERO be HAPPY. By the way, my daughter very looks like Alita, when my wife and I watched the movie, we were so wondered how our daughter looks like her.
