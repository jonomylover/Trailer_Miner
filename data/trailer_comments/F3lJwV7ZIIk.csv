MIB is a Marvel comic.  I cant help but look at the MIB films as their own Earth now, one where Thor & Valkyrie are MIB agents.   It would be badass if Marvel uses the Multiverse as a way to not only get an MCU SpiderMan/Sony Venom crossover going, but to have crossovers between Marvel & every other Sony property.   There's a Morbius film coming, a Blade/Morbius crossover would be sick. What if Sony brings back Andrew Garfield's Spider Man, but have SpiderGwen & Miles there, basically be a live-action SpiderVerse, and that has crossovers with MCU Spidey?  A SHIELD/MIB crossover, Will & Samuel together, would be crazy. If Disney bought Sony's film assets anytime soon, the Multiverse is the perfect way to avoid recasts.  Anyway, this will certainly be a fun film. But Will & Tommy better get a few scenes. If MIB is compromised, the film cant *NOT* have them around.
