2017-06-11T05:02:05,"The book was beautiful and emotional (I would smile then cry then smile as I'm crying, ridiculous I know) and it honestly showcased that not all kids get it, they don't all understand that what they're doing is truly wrong. Obviously there were kids that were nice to Auggie and looked past his physical appearance, but most of them got crap for it. The thing is all kids want to fit in, not necessarily be just like everyone else but they do want to feel that they belong. So for most people going out of their way to be nice to Auggie was a huge risk. At this point the names and the different games that were played wasn't viewed as mean, sure people probably thought ""I'm glad this isn't happening to me"" but for most, that was normal. Like all problems this worked itself out and all the kids were finally being nice to Auggie, they wouldn't per say ""go the extra mile"" but people stopped calling him names and playing the game and well it changed everything for Auggie. Of course Auggie went through a lot of pain before he got to that point and what happened at the camp shouldn't have been what it took for people to realize that the way they treated Auggie had to stop. Nonetheless at least things got better.

He almost reminds me of Ponyboy from the Outsiders. Both of them struggled to fit in when they were so obviously different. August was changed forever by his standing ovation. That reminds me of how Ponyboy strived to live in the ""golden moments"". The ceremony was August's golden moment. Both of them also have to rise against being singled out and torn down about things they can't help (Pony with his greaser lifestyle and Auggie with his deformities).

Some ignorant rude person started laughing and going  ""hahaha look at that kid what a dope"" I had to try hard to keep quiet in the theater and not shout. That just shows you  bullies don't just exist in books and movies. It is real, and anyone can be a bully. Sometimes we dont think about what we are saying and we just say we are ""joking"" even if it isn't funny and hurts people. What if that person in the theater was in his shoes?  He/she would be a much better person because they would understand what it is like to deal with rude people. Trust me. Not only will bullying ruin someone else's life, it will ruin yours. Every time you think about gossiping or teasing or violence,  put yourself in the other person's shoes. I'm sure you will reconsider it. Thank you for taking the time to read all this and I hope you will take my advice.We need to stop this kind of behavior.

After it was completed i had two visible  marks on my neck and chest, so through 3rd and 6th i got bullied and most ppl mimicked my voice. I always walked home crying , sat alone at lunch and everyone went a safe distance from me. I was devastated. Then one day some girls sat with me at lunch their names were angel , Lily , liset , alyssa , ruby , rebbeca and Andrea . they talked to me like their was nothing wrong with my voice and they thought i was pretty special. Our friendship went on for years. I usually went to the doctor to see if neck was ok. And he said when i turn 18 ill have a normal voice, i told my crew and they were really happy. My bullies left me alone and i even more happy. I'm eleven now they all are still my best friends.

Neverland is not America. get real. Remember that Native Americans look like they do, from america. not from every other part of the world. Neverland isnt earth, so they can look like whatever they want i would say. 4.

All they (when i say 'they', i mean the few of them that made my teachers hate the sixth grade) knew when my teacher asked questions was, ""he's got a weird face"" I was too disgusted with my class to even let them breathe in my direction.  So, this year my English teacher said that she's gonna take us on a field trip to the cinema to see this movie. I hope my class mates see this and learn to appreciate it. I think this is what's gonna teach them something much needed for them to make it in the world. It certainly taught me something, and I'm glad that I'm the one in the class that is super excited to see this film (and hopefully I will also see my best friend Zach bawl his eyes out at it - he cried when we read the book XD)",0,0,Layton Gayllagher,YRXmuv7JP-A,0.020674603174603175,2017-10-14 19:08:18,True,True

2017-12-07T00:50:41,"The book made me cry so much. Not because it's so sad, its that even though he doesn't look ordinary...He is so brave and kind. He has so much fun with other kids. But the sad part is, Every kid is the same. Maybe not on the outside, but all that matters is inside. I'd be friends with him. But if he was really mean, no. It matters how you act. Not look. I would want to go see all the childrens' parents that bully other kids and say, ""Your child is being so mean to other kids. They're only mean to other kids because you teach them that. Maybe they just decided to be mean."" But...Mostly...It's the parents' fault! It's their job to teach their children whats right and whats wrong. I just want to say to all the kids that are like Oggie,""You're so amazing. You're beautiful just the way you are. You were born to stand out. That's why you look how you look. Don't let anyone bring you down. Stay positive and have fun."". For all the bullies out there who read this, Please...Don't bully kids just cause how they look...Don't be thinking, oh well they hit me/called me stupid first! Tell an adult if they hurt you. Don't hurt them back. Thanks for reading. Stay positive and Magical! :)  Edited:  This is the original. If you don't believe me, look at the dates the other exact comments that were posted.
