2015-09-15T19:32:35,"+hey12358y, mediocre CGI at best, is difficult and time consuming to create, much less great CGI, with it's expense, and literally hundreds of people working to create it!   People think that just because it was made with a computer, that all that's required is just a couple clicks of a mouse, and a few key strokes, and voila! CGI! They think it's less artistic. But most of those people don't realize how much artistic talent  goes into creating great CGI. Everyone working on a CGI movie is an artist, especially when it comes to actually designing characters and creating CGI models, creating the textures; coloring, and lighting them and then animating them! All done by artists!   Sure they could use animatronics and fake stuffed animals, but then you'd be complaining how fake and cheap that looked, when the guy is wresting and rolling around on the ground with a stuffed tiger. And face it animatronics look like... well... animatronics!   So get over it already! CGI is not only a tool, it's an art form, and it's here to stay!  Also a lot of people here in the comments are comparing this to Disney's animated Jungle Book. There was also two other live action Jungle Book movies of any real mention! The first live action version was the 1942 Jungle Book, which starred the great Indian actor Sabu, and the other was the 1994 version, which starred Jason Scott Lee.

2015-09-16T16:32:49,"I'll be one of the first to say I'm not a huge fan of all these Disney live-action remakes (not saying they're bad movies, just unnecessary ones). I'll also be the first to say I truly wondered how they were going to cast parts for these (at least for me and my childhood) iconic voices.  Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, and George Sanders all completely owned those roles, and I have very, VERY fond memories of the original Disney film.  So, naturally, I was concerned when I heard not one but TWO new Jungle Book films were announced, one of which was being made by Disney.  After seeing the trailer, my action could be boiled down to this: Scarlett. Johansson.  Kaa was tied for my absolute favorite character in the original, and Sterling Holloway played the part to perfection. I'll admit I was more than a little worried when I heard that Scarlett would be voicing the sneaky snake.  She completely and utterly put all that doubt to rest the second I pieced together that it was Kaa doing the trailer voiceover. It just disappeared, vanished. She isn't Sterling Holloway, but neither is Holloway Scarlett Johansson. Both of them bring something very different but equally incredible to the role, and after hearing the obvious love and care Scarlett put into just the few lines heard here, I'm starting to think that this movie just might be the live-action Disney movie that softens me a little on the whole idea.  And having Idris Elba doesn't hurt either. That guy could have voiced the one of the trees and I'd still want to hear it. But freaking Shere Khan?  The casting is incredible, the overall look of the film looks promising. I dunno guys.

I'm just curious to see from what angle they hit this movie.   Alice in Wonderland: Prophesy/ Chosen One Oz the Great and Powerful: Prophesy/ Chosen One, villain turns evil because man cheats on her Maleficent: Villain turns evil because man cheats on her, redemption  Those movies were all recycled plots that we've already seen a million times.

2015-09-17T22:19:35,"t Heaven or hell? Make that decision today, you're not promised tomorrow. According to the Word of God, there is not a righteous person on earth (Romans 3:10) Because all have sinned and come short of the glory of God(Romans 3:23). Here's how a holy God defines evil: Whoever hates his brother is a murderer (1 John 3:15). Ever hated anyone? Ever told a lie?The Word of God states that "" All liars will have their part in the lake of fire "". In Revelation 21:8. Ever looked at someone with lust? Jesus said looking with lust is committing adultery in your heart (Matt. 5:28). Ever stolen anything? No thief and adulterer will inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:9,10).Because God is holy, He must punish all who sin, and His place of punishment is hell for all eternity.So you see, we've all done these things, we all deserve hell.And If you've done even one of these things, and have not repented and believed on Jesus, you currently are on your way to hell.God's standard of goodness is perfection,in thought, word, and deed so none of us can ever make it to heaven on our own. We are sinful, and even one sin will keep us from heaven. But In His great love and mercy, God provided a way for us to be forgiven of our sins and saved from that punishment. Through the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross to pay the penalty for your sins. I am sure you have heard of John 3:16? It's the most famous verse in the Bible, it reads "" For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life .""

2015-09-18T03:08:01,"One of the things I loved most about this was the female choice for the voice of Kaa. Scarlett is amazing in any sinister role, but I felt like this was especially fitting. I loved how comforting her voice was at first - how motherly it sounded... as if she was truly deeply concerned for Mowgli's well-being. Because I didn't expect the gender switch and couldn't immediately identify which character the voice belonged to, I found myself trusting the voice as well. I didn't even realize how menacing the undertone of her words were until I started recognizing the prolonged pronunciation of the S's and figured out it was Kaa. I think that embodies Kaa perfectly - hypnotically alluring and appearing trustful to the point where you can't tell they're tricking you before it's far too late.",1,0,Starling Day,HcgJRQWxKnw,0.23461538461538464,2015-09-18 03:08:01,True,True

I'm clarifying this as a reminder. But still, it doesn't hurt to stay cautious. I hope that he has been given the authority to have full control of the project. Plus i have to give credit for excellent casting. Idris Elba is excellent choice to play Shere Khan and most can agree on the fact bill performance as Baloo will be hopfully WAY BETTER then.......Garfield. I will say it cool to point out that Richard M. Sherman is returning to write the songs for the film. I'm sure the songs are gonna do well and most likely dedicate the songs to his late brother Robert B. Sherman, since they both wrote a long songs together for as long as Richard can remember and misses him every day. Just as Ridley Scott misses his brother Tony Scott everyday as well or for any one else who's lost someone close to them for that matter. Point is, this film is good hands. I will remind everyone that form what i've herd from those who read the book, say it ain't all that bright and colorful from what we've seen form the 1967. Don't get me wrong, i love that movie with a passion. I'm just pointing out when they adapted it, they had to make a few changes, like all many film adaptations do. Even veteran animator Chuck Jones's version counts as well. I should point this out as well. Warner Bros. Pictures is also developing a live-action version of there own titled Jungle Book: Origins, with Steve Kloves writing and Andy Serkis set to direct. Serkis will also be providing the voice of Baloo. Previously, Ron Howard was originally set to helm as director. The film was originally set for release on October 21, 2016, with a title of Jungle Book: Origins. The film will be released a year later on October 6, 2017. Benedict Cumberbatch joined the film to voice the lead role of Shere Khan (Brilliant casting choice since Smaug), Christian Bale as Bagheera (Awesome), Cate Blanchett as Kaa (Nice), Naomie Harris as Raksha (REALY GOOD CHOICE), Tom Hollander as Tabaqui, Eddie Marsan as Papa Wolf, Peter Mullan as Akela, and Rohan Chand as Mowgli also added to the cast. It's funny that two Studios are each doing there take on the story. I like that Kaa in both versions are voiced by amazing actresses. I do appreciate that both films are in good hands. Also, the director was born 1966 and jungle book animated film was the year after. I'm sure he loved that movie, if ever did see it as kid growing up. So that little bit was for any one loved the Animated version. This my is just my opinion guys.",0,0,Nelson Guerrero,HcgJRQWxKnw,0.3629960317460317,2015-09-21 23:31:40,True,True

Well I herd or should I say I've just discovered this Origin of a DINOTOPIA Film on Wikipedia some time ago & it quotes. Quote: Plans for a DINOTOPIA film were previously rejected due to the expense of creating a world populated by both humans and dinosaurs. Both Columbia Pictures and Disney at one time made the attempt, but both studios abandoned the idea, Disney opting to make their own homegrown film, Dinosaur in 2000. Hallmark Entertainment chief Robert Halmi Sr. then purchased the rights after having seen Gurney's book. Unquote. Well true A miniseries was seen on TV on Disney ABC. Including the continuing series. I just notices Disney is making a live action film The Jungle Book. If they made a Live action Film with Talking animals in that new Disney Film coming to Theaters Next Spring. That's why couldn't make a feature Film with humans & Dinosaurs AKA Talking Dinosaurs on the Big Screen. Based on James Gurney's award winning books. Well if you know Disney see if they can try to make a DINOTOPIA film on the Big Screen as they've originally started & tried years ago. Well good luck contacting Walt Disney Studios. Bye. Oh & one more thing. If there's some new animals in this live action version of Disney's The Jungle Book, Could there be some Crocodiles too? Well in India there are Marsh Crocodiles AKA Mugger Crocodiles, Gharials AKA Gharial Crocodiles & The Largest of All The of all Saltwater Crocodiles AKA Indopacific & Estuarine Crocodiles. As a matter of fact there is a Crocodile character In The Jungle Book Stories & his name is named Jacala. Jacala the Crocodile.

The best thing about the original Kaa, was that he was goofy, and funny. Where is that now?? She could never be that. It just doesn't fit. It's not the right voice. It should've been a guy's voice. Original Kaa may have been seen as pretty annoying, but dam* funny at the same time. With her, it's just plain annoying. If they wanted to go for a more serious movie with no funnyies, or funny moments, they could've still gave the snake a guy's voice. One that would remind you of the original Kaa's voice, except like 5 times darker, and more creepier. That would've been equally as scary, luring and menacing! It doesn't seem that it would work to me. She could never be Kaa, or at least like the original Kaa. The rest seems like it will really work out great.

So, what would you call that thing that happens at the end of this trailer where in an ""after credits"" type of scene, they give us a glimpse of Baloo whistling the classic *""Bare Necessities""* song? I'm not asking for you to describe it (i.e. floating on a river, etc), I'm saying, what is that type of moment called? Please, seriously think about it, I'd like to know. Is there a word for it? It's obviously instantly recognizable to us, and if you're like me, you thought, ""omg...they included that song, that's really, really cool!""   So what's that called? You might say, ""well, I’m not quite sure what you’re asking, and why this Youtube comment is so weird and long, but this is obviously a scene where the they included that classic song,"" or ""they're kind of redoing something from the past.""  Well, first off, I said ""_word_,"" not a sentence to describe that moment :). The best I can come up with are words like, *""homage,"" ""callback,"" or ""tribute.""* If you wanna stretch it, maybe even ""reference."" The problem with those words are, it doesn't quite have the right connotation. At all. Not even a little bit. *It's completely lifeless and devoid of the actual emotional reaction we get when seeing such scenes.*   Here's what I mean. It's not as if we would use any of those words and say, *""oh cool, they paid homage to that song,"" or ""haha, nice callback.""* No, in watching that scene, as that tune played, *you probably smiled to yourself, while others who are huge fans may have hunched forward towards their monitors and put their hands to their open mouths, eyes wide with joy and surprise. While even bigger fans may have pushed their feet on the floor to scoot backwards in their office/gaming chairs. Finally, people that saw this in groups, most likely smiled giddily and looked around to silently say, “please tell me you recognized that song!”*  Whatever the degree of reaction, there's an emotional content there. And again, to describe these moments of *nostalgia*, all we really have is our own emotional reactions for to describe it (just look at the comments that reference the end of this trailer, all of them say something to the effect of, “was that song what I thought it was?” and “wow they included the song.”).  There’s no single word that I know of, and there should be. We have a lot of words to choose from to communicate thoughts and Ideas. To be as granular and precise as we want, to spin our intentions just the way we want, to put the exact, tiniest connotation on an idea to make our points. But not here. They didn’t think of a word to describe this type of moment, but they’re going to have to.

This new one is very good and it has everything that does make a brilliant masterpiece all time classic.and the boy is so much like Mowgli. this new one is for all true fans of the original. no true fans of the original would say this is not good. when i saw the original as a very young boy i seen myself as Mowgli and when i saw it as an adult i seen me as Baloo. this one will go on like the original.,0,0,Thomas McGready,HcgJRQWxKnw,0.22945221445221448,2017-01-24 14:14:43,False,False

My big issues with this film are the songs & the similarities to other disney classics. The songs have no harmony, no energy, & they are not really singing. The sequence's are exceedingly similar to the lion king & tarzan. The plot is barely original but has a little bit more lion king in there, & there's a little bit of tarzan in there too.
