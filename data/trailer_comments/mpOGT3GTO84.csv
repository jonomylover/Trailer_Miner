Not a rock star in any way, shape, or form. And to add the fact that people are asking for movies that already exist? Like a Beatles movie (there‚Äôs like 400 billion beatles movies) and a Michael Jackson movie (heard of ‚Äúthis is it‚Äù?). I‚Äôm glad these people are getting recognition and all but it‚Äôs really the pushing of titles based on the names of songs. You know that the reason these names have been chosen is due to their significance to each band? Epic Poem (Bohemian Rhapsody) is a great name for Freddie Mercury‚Äôs extremely intense life, and rocketman perfectly describes the charisma, talent and long-lasting success that Elton John had (and continues to have). You can‚Äôt just call a Led Zeppelin movie ‚ÄúStairway to Heaven.‚Äù What about ‚ÄúGood Times Bad Times‚Äù? You can‚Äôt call a Beatles movie ‚ÄúHey Jude.‚Äù That doesn‚Äôt even make sense.

I'd love for this to happen.
