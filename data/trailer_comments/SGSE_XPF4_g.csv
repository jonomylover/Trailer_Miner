There is a technique you can take advantage of to get pinpoint 20/20 vision naturally without the use of glasses or contacts. When someone breaks their arm do they wear a cast forever? not a chance, The body completely replenishes and eventually goes back to normal. Your eyes arethe strongest muscle in the body so why is it when it is harmed and cannot function properly (Imperfect or blurry vision,) do we wrap them up in a permanent cast? Your visual cortex CAN and will heal itself if given the proper treatment.

2015-03-26T01:03:43,"Are you aware that  when you wear glasses it actually  greatly damages your vision? through the passage of time you might have noticed that your vision gets harder and harder to see without them. Glasses are injury causing for your vision they actually make your eyes even more damaged than they were to begin with. There is a program you can utilize to get impeccable 20/20 vision naturally without the use of glasses or contacts. When someone breaks their arm do they wear a cast forever? No way, The arm heals and eventually goes back to normal.  You may not know this but the eye is the strongest muscle in the body, So why is it that when your vision gets bad do they put you in a permanent cast without any hope of removal? Your visual cortex CAN and will replenish itself if given the proper care.  Listen everybody, This is  crucially important so please help yourself by doing yourself a favor and go and just take a few minutes to quickly look into this because it is true you can get perfect eyesight back and  throw out your glasses and contacts forever and see well no matter your age, No matter how old you are because ,age has nothing to do with your eyesight.

2015-05-19T21:55:33,"The plot seems weird, why would Vince want to direct a movie? he is the laziest guy ever, he just likes to be an actor, party and chill with the boys. Also he would never direct something that he hasn't written himself he is really ego about that sort of stuff. Secondly if Ari is the new studio head, i believe he took over from John Ellis that means that he now runs everything, why would a 100 milj dollar movie being canceled ruin his career. When smokejumpers was canceled that didn't ruin John Ellis career, Dana Gordon even said, he is the head of the studio, he can do whatever he wants and I quote - ""This is why I hire women to blow me, not run my studio"" meaning that I might have to blow him to keep my job. So the plot for this movie makes no sense really, I like though the parts with Johnny drama and Turtle in the trailer. I just don't get the main plot. It should be the head of the studio buying something big like a new franchise like ""Starwars"" for 4billion dollars or maybe buying another studio in asia somewhere, something really big like trying to film an action sequence in space like James Cameron would try to do if he could, and Vince and the gang have already conquered everything in the world, he is even married,  he should be more about taking it easy and pursuing other things above money and fame etc, a perfect thing would be Ari wanting Vinny to take over a new franchise but he just wants to do a documentary somewhere and it becomes the most expensive and impossible documentary ever, in space! haha, it needs to be something more creative and surprising!",0,0,VideoPine,SGSE_XPF4_g,0.14974747474747477,2015-05-19 21:55:33,True,True

Former huge fan of the show, I binge-watched every season repeatedly as a sort of reality escape not to be taken too seriously, so just self-indulgent escapism. But at some point around season 6 I was looking for some kind of redemption for these self-absorbed shallow characters, but it never really happened, with seasons 7 and 8 sucking horribly. But the ultimate crucifixion of my love for Entourage was The Movie. Watched it once then had to sort of go puke and take a long shower to wash away the filth. Having seen that movie and watch these assholes just fuck up everything and reveal how truly shallow and self-obsessed they are/were, it is no longer of interest to re-watch the show even when it was good (seasons 1-5). Yeah I know it's just a TV show and the characters read/act according to a script/director, but I'm now SO DONE with their brand of sensationalist amusement park ride lifestyle. Ultimately, Entourage just served as a bad tasting tribute to the shallow vacant selfish artificial fake greedy side of Hollywood and those who suck up to whoever is the current ""celeb"". Bleah! Have to vomit again. So goodbye Entourage and the shitty fake materialistic selfish world it represents. Hurl!",1,0,nongthip,SGSE_XPF4_g,-0.1867424242424242,2019-10-19 05:23:59,False,False
