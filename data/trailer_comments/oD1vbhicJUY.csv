Her mentor, Yon-Rogg, warns her to control her ability to fire photon blasts from her hands. When she loses her temper, Vers meets with the Supreme Intelligence, an artificial intelligence and the Kree's ruler, who offers the same warning.  Yon-Rogg leads Vers and fellow Starforce members Att-Lass, Bron-Char, Korath and Minerva to a planet infiltrated by the Skrulls, a race of alien shapeshifters that can perfectly simulate anyone, and with whom the Kree are at war. When attempting to extricate a captured spy, Vers is taken prisoner and subjected to a memory probe by the Skrulls' General Talos. Escaping with Talos and others in pursuit, she reaches Earth ‚Äî crashing through a Blockbuster Video store in Los Angeles. She rigs a communication device to contact Starforce, and her presence attracts police as well as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury and Phil Coulson. As they question her, they are fired upon by a Skrull in disguise. Vers pursues the alien, but after a fight aboard a train, loses him ‚Äî though not without recovering a crystal containing her disjointed extracted memories, which her lead her to a bar in a nearby town. Meanwhile Fury, driving after Vers, discovers a Skrull impersonating Coulson. The alien dies when Fury purposefully crashes the car. Fury follows a lead to the bar with Vers, while Talos impersonates Fury's boss, Keller.  Fury and Vers agree to work together, and using Fury's security clearance visit the secret air base Pegasus that appeared in Vers' deep memory along with the identity of the older woman, Dr. Wendy Lawson. They learn Lawson was a Kree, and died along with her pilot in a 1989 crash while flight-testing her light-speed engine ‚Äî and that the pilot was Vers. Avoiding capture by ""Keller"" and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Vers and Fury escape in a small cargo jet, with Lawson's cat Goose, adopted by the base, having stowed away. In Louisiana, Fury and Vers speak to Maria Rambeau, Vers' fellow jet pilot (callsign ""Photon""), the last person to see Lawson and Vers alive. They fill each other in with the help of Maria's young daughter Monica, and Vers learns she was jet pilot Carol Danvers. Talos, who had tracked her, arrives and asks to speak. Using the black-box recorder of Lawson's crashed plane, Danvers learns an alien spaceship had shot it down ‚Äî and she now remembers Yon-Rogg killing Lawson, as well as Lawson's warning that the experimental engine's energy-core had to be destroyed to keep it from the wrong hands. Vers shot it and was caught in an ensuing explosion, with her body absorbing the energy. Yon-Rogg brought the amnesiac ""Vers"" ‚Äî the remaining portion of ""Danvers"" on her broken dog tag ‚Äî to Hala.  Talos explains the Skrulls are simply refugees, and Lawson's engine was to help them escape beyond Kree reach. Using coordinates Lawson had given Danvers, she, along with Fury, Monica, and Goose ‚Äî who for some reason terrifies Talos ‚Äî fly their Skrull-modified cargo jet to a cloaked ship in orbit. There they find the source of the energy-core's power, the Tesseract ‚Äî and some Skrull refugees, including Talos' mate and child. Yon-Rogg's Starforce, having tracked them, captures Danvers and places her in VR before the Supreme Intelligence. Enraged at being used, Danvers fights back, and discovers that a Kree implant that purportedly gave her Kree powers was instead limiting them. Accessing her full force, Danvers escapes, gives the Tesseract to Fury for safekeeping, and battles the Starforce to give Rambeau time to fly herself, Fury, and the Skrulls to Earth ‚Äî along with Goose, who is not a cat but an alien known as a Flerken that can sprout powerful tentacles and whose insides are a pocket dimension where the Tesseract is placed. Rambeau shoots down a pursuing Minerva. Danvers chases an escaping Yon-Rogg and discovers the extent of her powers, including flight. She singlehandedly destroys multiple ballistic missiles that Kree official Ronan the Accuser, called in by Yon-Rogg, has fired at Earth, and forces Ronan's forces to retreat. On Earth, Danvers quickly defeats Yon-Rogg and sends him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.  Danvers agrees to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, giving Fury a modified pager with which to contact her in an emergency. Fury later drafts a proposal for an initiative, changing the name after finding a photo with Danvers' old callsign of ""Avenger"".  In a present-day mid-credits scene, Danvers meet Avengers Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, and James Rhodes, who were monitoring the pager Fury had activated. In an end-credits flashback, Goose coughs up the Tesseract.",2,0,Jared Cruz,oD1vbhicJUY,-0.04364478114478115,2019-03-07 00:56:42,True,True

When you do this salvation is yours, otherwise when you die you will go to hell for eternity.  God and Jesus will send the Holy Spirit to live in you, to grow you as a Christian, which means ""Christ follower"".  He will lead you to live holy, to live righteously in fear of God with a heart and a spirit that is transformed to do good works which please God and Jesus.  He will also lead you to a Bible believing, preaching church.

In this scenario, can any of us honestly say they wouldn't get revenge? We, as normal humans, typically don't because we are weak. We can't fly, put our hand in a running lawnmower blade and not have it cut off, or effortlessly crush someones hand by taking it. Not to mention the laser eyes! I'm confident that regardless of what we say we would do in such a situation, EVERYONE would most likely use these powers for their own gain and soon wouldn't care about the greater good or humanities ""justice"".

2019-03-22T23:46:00,"This is obviously a twist on the Superman Story, what if he would turn to bad?   The big difference here are  the adoptive and caring parents.  Martha and Jonathan Kent, in Superman's case,  they both instituted morals on his adoptive son.  There is an excellent scene in Man of Still when a young Clark Kent is overwhelmed by his out of control senses that he runs from his classroom and hides in a closet, he hears his classmates calling him a freak then his mother Martha came to help him get out of the closet.  With great powers comes great responsibility, remember who told that to Spiderman?  His uncle Ben, who was a good and honest man and Peter changed when he failed to save him by letting a delincuent scape when he could have stopped him.   In the TV series Smallville, a teen aged Clark Kent also spent a period of time abusing his power.  And here is the real problem:  Power corrupts, absolute power absolutely corrupts, so it would be easier to accept that a powerful human like alien would turn to bad rather than to good, because being good is hard and being bad is fun.  But this notion is getting out of hand in this depiction, bordeline in sadistic on this Brightburn movie. You see a protective mother which is logical coming from a woman who could not bear children.  There is also a scene where she tells him that he is a blessing, so you wonder what made him change into evil, to abuse his power when his mother seems very good.  Also the scene with the lawn mower it just is simply ridiculous, no one on his right mind would try to stop the blade with his hand, if you want to know if you are strong or bulletproof you would start with basics, a needle, a knife, hitting a wall, but what if you were wrong and while trying to stop the blade your fingers get cut off?

His Face hasn't been revealed yet So, my theory is that there is an evil twin here that is doing this killings. Coz whenever he (the cape kid) supposedly killed someone in the trailer, we didn't get to see his face just a mask. And whenever the kid was shown in the trailer he never had blood on him at any part of his body. My guess is that he has a brother out there and somehow they are telepathically connected or the kid's suffering from split personality disorder. I know this is not much to support my theory but its all i got, and for those who are thinking ""But the kid was sitting inside the crashed plane"" I feel that was a misdirection.

In all seriousness though, it‚Äôs funny how this is being hailed as something new and creative (and I‚Äôm really excited to see it!) when in many ways it is one of the more logical ends for a kid with superpowers?  Imagine growing up, being treated like a messiah figure by your parents. You weren‚Äôt born on earth so you likely grow up exhibiting likely aspergers or autistic-like symptoms, and when other kids start to bully you for it, you realize you have superpowers. You‚Äôre strong, you can fly, you can shoot lasers from your eyes. No other kid can do that. Mom always said you were special. You start dreaming of the place that you called home, memories creeping in. You were raised in a militaristic society. Blood and death defined your birth. Mom and dad lied to you. You‚Äôre not human, you never were. They start to realize you‚Äôre not human. They start to get scared, wondering if you‚Äôre a monster. A demon instead of an angel. So you start to wonder the same. You‚Äôre not human. You never were. So why do you have to follow their rules? Your people believed in war, believed in winning battles through bloodshed. Soon enough, you‚Äôre locking the doors to the school and blowing it up. You‚Äôre murdering the woman who called you a freak in the principal‚Äôs office. You‚Äôre chasing your father, and you‚Äôre chasing your mother.  They all deserve it. Because they lied.

Only after he discovers he's different from others when he turns 12 his adapted mother is forced to tell him of his unearthly origins. But it's never revealed his place of birth or who sent him and why. . But I doubt it's Krypton.    His Adapted mom does learn of a kryptonite like weakness the character has. But does she wait too long to attempt to stop the savage carnage being ravaged by her beloved adapter son?  See for yourselves    Well produced and intense film.

He always has to keep himself, both physically and mentally, in check so he doesn‚Äôt kill anyone. Imagine being angry and punching someone, they may get a bruise but that‚Äôs it. Now imaging channeling that same exact anger into a gun instead of a fist; the same anger can cause much more harm. That is what Superman has to worry about all the time.

2019-08-19T22:20:02,"SPOILERS   This movie has plot holes; one of which is (spoiler) that the kids mom tries to kill him with a piece of metal from the ship that brought him here. That's ridiculous and makes no sense, why would the aliens send him here in a ship built of a metal that could kill him!?  Also, this movie has lame moments when it becomes self aware and spoils the horror atmosphere its trying to create, using humor. In one scene the kid is being possesed or spoken to by an alien presence, he shakes like a boy possesed by demons, then the camera pans to a bobble head toy shaking its head! üòí  In the scene where the kid kills a man in a car, the guy playing the victim does the WORST ACTING and says lamest lines I've seen.  This film feels like the creators didn't really know what they wanted it to be. It could have been great if they turned it into a criminal thriller like Silence Of The Lambs, but the most interesting scenes in it just end up being over the top gore porn.  We don't feel much for Brandon because the motivations for him turning ""evil"" are so weak. He's a freak at school and a girl he likes found him creepy, is that enough to turn a child into a homicidal maniac? No. If they had had him experience some trauma or dangerous situation where he accidentally killed someone then developed a taste for it, that would have worked. Also his powers like invulnerability and super strength just suddenly happen, not like he was born with them.   People who want to see superman kill people might enjoy this, but the action scenes are the only real reason to watch this movie.

Yeah, there's possibly a tiny hint from when the kid gives an answer in class about hornet reproduction, but what the hell does even that mean? And why is he such a freakin' genius? Is he the anti-Superman? Why? Why would any extraterrestrial race deposit a kid on Earth so randomly, if they have serious intentions of taking over? And what's here on Earth that's so very, very necessary for said ET's to take from us Earthlings?

The characters could end up discovering that all of them share the same vision; since they clearly are ""superior"" than the rest of us puny humans. Massacring and slaughtering as they wish until they become literally our masters and us their slaves. The world literally in the hands of 6 or 7 individuals. That would rule unchallenged. And in this universe or reality aliens would come to save us and not exterminate us. Of course it wouldn`t hurt to also add a few superheroes that might be able to stand against them or alongside the aliens. Even if at the end they get defeated the battles would be so severe that more than half of humanity would be decimated; making our planet barely habitable.
