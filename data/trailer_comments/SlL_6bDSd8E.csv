2018-08-17T03:49:46,"Being both a serious dog lover and a serious wolf lover I must say that I cannot wait to see this movie. I have heard people ask did dogs train human beings or did human beings train dogs. I believe that human beings and dogs trained each other. Dogs helped train man by helping them develop the senses and skills to sense, recognize, and combat dangers in the world as well as hunt for food and humanity trained dogs how to be a companion where they could work together and help each other. Dogs helped the human beings protect their safety and food and in return the human beings shared the food with them, gave them warmth of fire, and protection from enemies that dogs could not handle by using their weapons and providing strength in numbers. This is why the partnership between humanity and dogs has lasted for so long because both sides know they need each other. This is also why dogs are submissive to their human being masters and respect them as the masters and leaders because they know human beings have the power to enforce their will with their advanced brains, minds, and tools that dogs know they do not have or are unable to use. They know human beings can use tools and get what they want so it is better to submit to them and work with them rather than resist and get hurt and possibly even killed and then be forced to obey anyway. I have also heard from the comments of other users who ends of being the true Alpha in the movie: Keda, the character of Kodi Smit-McPhee, or the Chuck the Wolfdog. Yes the Wolfdog who plays in the movie has been named. I believe that it will turn out that they end up working together as a team where both consider the other an equal and neither is the Alpha. But if I had to pick one or the other I would say Keda since human beings have the brains, minds, and tools that make them the dominate species on the planet. I believe that all animals like wolves can sense that human beings are dominate over them in terms of power and that would make Chuck in the movie willing to submit to Keda as leader. That is the process of domestication. Wild animals do not submit to us but domesticated animals who have bonded with us do. Part of bonded with us is that they accept us as the masters and those who are the masters are also the leaders, at least usually. Finally many users have commented that Chuck will probably die before the end of the movie. Although that is definitely possible I think there could be another solution. I believe that Chuck finds a mate and breeds with her, then their puppies become the first little adopted by humanity that starts the selective breeding process leading to the creation of the dog. This is indicated by how it shows the Wolf Puppy howling at 0:00-0:03 and then again at 1:33-1:37. I guess we will all find out one way or the other by actually watching the movie.

I've sat through the other standard Hollywood fare,and been bored with the crap they churn out,but was totally hooked on the sentiment,simplicity and narrative of this beautiful story,and really enjoyed watching it...I think the reason it was enjoyable is that even though it is a 'big production' ,it is made in an understated way, and the connection to feelings most of us have really pulled me in...I would strongly advise going to see this on the big screen while you can.
