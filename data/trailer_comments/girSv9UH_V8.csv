The directors of the first Blair Witch were kinda terrible human beings. All that anger and anxiety and terror that you see from the actors in the movie is real. The directors gave the actors their script and camera, and then gave them them the shooting locations, which also had food. As the filming went on, though, the amount of food the actors were given began to shrink. Then at night, the directors would go to their tent and shake it and scratch at it and just fuck with their actors minds. After filming the movie, the three actors had to deal with PTSD. Obviously, the directors of this movie couldn't do the same. Stuff like that would hit the news. Hopefully....",0,0,Kenny Brightwell,girSv9UH_V8,-0.018750000000000013,2016-07-24 09:52:14,True,True

Here's the most important thing. The movie? Ha! No the movie trailer! 7. Incorporate *Horror_audio_356.wav* then splash a little of *Jump_scare_568.wav* and add some shaky cam.  Aaaaand Tada!

Of course it will be different from the original (different kind of horror, HD video, and shit happening on screen.), but still, from what I've seen, it's still largely better than Book of Shadows. Plus, after reading reviews, it seems that this movies connects with the first one, a lot. The only mistake could be that they didn't want to take risks. This movie has apparently a lot of scenes remades from the original to the new actual one. But if the Blair Witch's lore is taken seriously, then it could be good.  I don't think it will tie with the original one, but it could be the sequel we all wanted if Book of Shadows never existed. And yeah, Book of Shadows NEVER existed.

Your mind made most of the scary shit up and that's what the movie set out to do. It was successful in making you feel scared without showing you much of anything, letting your imagination do the work while engrossing you in the lore and atmosphere little by little, which made the ending as jarring as it was. Hell, in the end, you never saw much of anything, and that's fucking great. Now this pile of garbage on a hot summer day reveals every cliche in the handy cam book while giving away the whole movie in the goddamn trailer, letting you know it's throwing out everything you liked about subtlety and giving you everything you hate about modern horror.

It is hard to put into words how this line fills me with so much dread about this movie. It makes me think that instead of being helpless people with bad shit happening to them, they are coming with some kind of stupid knowledge about how to fight the witch. The in-the-corner part of TBWP was the very end of the film when the two remaining kids were getting killed, so I imagine this also takes place at or very near the end of this movie. Are they trying to trick the witch or whatever force is in the house that they are already dead, or mind-controlled or whatever? That is fucking stupid.

2016-08-05T08:53:36,I believe a very good 2nd blair witch movie would have been if they used the same filming method as 1st time but with less shaky camera method. Don't use no Hollywood background light bulshit in the woods like they did with book of shadows (watch the night time background scenes of each movie blair witch and the night scenes in the woods on the book of shadows and you'll know what I mean) they should of had almost the same story line such as a couple kids go into the woods looking for the Blair witch and/or the 3 missing from 1994. This time in this movie show more of the night scenes (just like BWP slowly increasing the scare) they find the 7 piles of rocks and a separate 3. This time they could of had the little kids voices and also heather mike and josh's spirit voices tormenting them. And I think a scary ending would be if 1 or 2 people were left the last night in the tent and the cameras lighting went out but still recording sound an they hear the witch/spirits coming and they know they are going to die and can't even see an inch infront of they're face. üëàas if you were out in the deep forest at 3am on a moonless night with no city lights laminating the near by sky's.,0,0,Pitt Burgh,girSv9UH_V8,0.016315789473684214,2016-08-05 08:53:36,True,True

The fact so much is left to the viewer's imagination is what's so effective, as well as the low budget. The protagonists didn't have the greatest equipment they could. The stuff they'll be using in this movie is too good to be believable. The biggest thing is that I fear they may go and do something stupid and show us what's chasing them. We never saw the Blair Witch or God knows whatever else may have been after the college students in the first movie and that worked so damn well.

2016-08-24T17:18:18,"It goes to show the difference in generations. What made the first Blair witch good, was how understated it was.  It didn't rely on loud noises and jump-scares to be scary.  It was done in such a way that it put the viewer in the experience, too.  The movie was emotional and scary because you could empathize with the characters, and suspend your disbelief to a point where you felt like you were there.  Nowadays, most horror movies rely on shaky-cam and predictable jump-scares, in lieu of a good story or suspenseful plot lines or emotional character arcs.  The first Blair witch was somewhat believable because it left the supernatural elements to your imagination, whereas (albeit all of my info is only from the trailer) this new one looks to be more ""in your face"" with it.  It's like they focus-grouped the first movie, and just took all the scary parts that tested well from the first one and just made a movie about those parts.  Obviously I haven't seen the movie yet, but as is the case with mostly all modern horror movies, it's probably overdone and not truly going to live up to the reviews and claims of it being ""One of the scariest movies ever made"". Attention spans have shortened these days. If you take a teenager and try to get them to watch the original ""Psycho"", or ""The Exorcist"", they would probably tell you that it's too slow and not scary.  To me, a scary movie comes from the plot, not the special effects.",0,0,Ian Porter,girSv9UH_V8,0.11682376763021925,2016-08-24 17:18:18,True,True

But people like it? it had a scene that was turned into a meme ten times over, placing the camera right under a girls nose as it starts running wasn't scary it was just cringy |:  This movie, objectively speaking, was just terrible. But it's getting a sequel because people liked it, meanwhile hordes of people hate on movies that are just fine.  Honestly the movie industry is getting pretty ridiculous, So many film series were destroyed before they even started despite being actually pretty good movies, for absolutely terrible reasons that are straight up nitpicking.  Yet a movie like this with amateur camera work that prevents us from seeing the character/s central to the plot in such a way that it's just annoying is actually successful? o_O  If you like it good for you, its an extra movie you can enjoy, and that isn't a bad thing.  I just honestly don't get how movies like this can be successful enough to generate a sequel, even if it's later down the line.  Yet movies such as john carter and Jupiter rising which are meant to be a film series, flop hard with pretty much no decent reason at all.  John carter's primary reason is that they deviated from the book somewhat, and it pissed off those who enjoyed the book. But for me, as someone who hadn't read the book, the movie itself was really good, and it would have been great for it to get its deserved sequel.

You literally saw nothing, ever. There would just suddenly be these loud bangs, the camera would jerk around wildly, and you would just see nothing at all. Just totally random loud bangs for no reason with sudden camera movement.  In my opinion, this movie represents and is a perfect example of a serious decline in America's intelligence and taste. Most of the people in the theater? They loved it. They actually loved this piece of shit excuse for a movie.

2016-09-21T02:49:47,"Listen, I'm a huge fan of the first film. I've seen it easily about ten times in my life, and each time I enjoy it. The film was/is awesome because it created some kind of possibility that any one of us could rent a camera and shoot a movie dirt cheap, it gave people hope that anybody could make a movie. It's also very unsettling, much like the discomfort level you feel when watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) because it almost felt like watching something really happen. TBWP is hosted as a last document, from start to finish, of three people's mysterious deaths. What more could you ask a horror movie to have?  It was also an original experience, a fresh idea and execution.   Blair Witch, is not, as they claim, a ""game changing"" horror film. Blair Witch is a knock-off, a re-imagining. It's almost like Rob Zombie bought the rights to it and made it on his own (he didn't, obviously), in that same vein. The film, itself, contributed a few cool things for the mythos of the Blair Witch, few as in far and little. The rest of the movie, from start to finish, is basically completely derived from the first film. They took so many ideas that had already been thought up and stamped them in probably because it was easier than having the characters do something different with their time in the woods.   They took an idea that could have had potential and turned it into another loud-bang thriller, one of many others, that rely on jump-scares way too much and doesn't tap any further than that.",0,0,Ann Xiety,girSv9UH_V8,0.18244949494949492,2016-09-21 02:49:47,False,True

2016-12-26T12:47:27,"I saw it yesterday. It is not the greatest horror movie I have ever seen, but it is not as bad as people made it sound. My main criticism is that it is too much ""over the top"". Too many forest sounds, too many chases in the forest, the house is too decayed... What is great about found footage is that it is supposed to diffuse fright in a more subtle manner, rather than put you in panick mode for 90 minutes. We see too much of the witch, too much of the ""ghosts"". This movie just shows too much, and by doing so, lacks that charm the original had by suggesting all along (and in the end confirming) the presence of an unnatural force, rather than showing it in your face. It is overall well done though, it has a lot of effective jump scares, and is much intense¬†and ""fantastic"" than the other. If it is what you like in a horror movie, you might like this one.

2017-09-18T19:45:15,Total opposite of what made the original scary. No scene in this film came close to the first few nights in the first film. The original remained a bit more on the realistic side. It wasn't all Hollywood staged and tweaked on effects. The ps2 looking ghost didn't help much either. The camera usuage wasn't fitting this time around. The first film got by on it. This film really fucking annoyed me. From the calling out for each other and that annoying camera sound effect shit. Everything is annoyingly sound tweaked to shit. No character development either. Could careless about any of them. The relations in the first film seemed authentic. The realistic factor was missing here. It was all Hollywood put. Something the first film avoided throughout much of the making. Once again. Annoying! Half the time you are wondering what the fuck is going on.
