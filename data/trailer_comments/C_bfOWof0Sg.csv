2017-06-22T09:26:35,"Honestly this doesn't look very good. Don't get me wrong, I think a movie about a young Thurgood Marshall sounds cool, but I just can't see Chadwick Boseman as Thurgood Marshall. He just seems like a character in this. He doesn't even look anything like him. He seems more like Idris Elba in this trailer than Thurgood Marshall. In fact I actually thought it was Idris Elba when I saw the poster and I thought ""I don't know about that casting..."" The whole thing really seems like a production, and not a realistic biopic.  Honestly I think Sterling K. Brown maybe could've done a bit of a better job as Thurgood Marshall. And this has nothing to do with the fact that he was a lawyer on The People vs OJ Simpson, he just seems more like Thurgood Marshall than Chadwick Boseman does. Even still, I think they probably could cast someone better than that. I mean if you see pictures of Thurgood Marshall, he's actually pretty light-skinned. Chadwick Boseman has much darker skin than he does.  Someone in the comments suggest Jussie Smollett. I've never heard of this actor before, but he certainly looks more like Thurgood Marshall, at least in complexion.",4,12,RyFi,C_bfOWof0Sg,0.24642261904761908,2017-06-22 09:26:35,True,True

2017-09-24T13:42:27,"I sure hope this movie has a reasonable and intelligent message and isn't meant to spur on the race war that Hollywood and the media keep trying to push.  I get very concerned when I see movies on this topic now, because while spurring on racial conflict is nothing new in Hollywood, things are reaching the point well past stupidity in the world right now, especially in America.    When I grew up, (I'm 32) racism was well on it's way out in this country - and it stayed that way up until the second half of Obama's presidency in most places in the US.  I don't know what to attribute to this change specifically, but now?  Everyone is racist, even people of the same race, if they disagree on ...anything, literally anything.  Obviously there are plenty of people who still know what's going on and see these movements for what they are, but that portion that literally see specters in every corner have gotten a hell of a lot more vocal and outgoing.   I'll probably watch this movie, so here's hoping it isn't more division propaganda by the end - I don't think people need any more help being pissed off and irrational about all this - because racism tends to appear only when people start looking for it - at least where I live.  This change in the last couple years is extremely sad, if you ask me.  It's sad that it doesn't even matter what side of the theoretical fence you're on, you'll still see a lot more examples of what I'm talking about now than 10 years ago, and I'm not inclined to believe it's the majority - it sure isn't among the people I know personally.  You really can never tell how Hollywood is going to change a story to suit an agenda ... and when something is based on reality it probably shouldn't be done because it's going to mislead people.

And the Louisiana Purchase was at the Holland land office in Batavia New York. Have been in there it's a museum anyone can go people come from all over.
