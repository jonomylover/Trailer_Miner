2015-02-07T00:07:09,"I have been anticipating this remake for over 2 years now. But after watching this trailer, all hope is crushed. Out of all the ""remakes"", ""reboots"", and ""re-imaginings"" they have made (or should I say ruined?), the only ones that were actually worth watching are Rob Zombie's Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (I also loved ""I Spit On Your Grave""). Of course there are the others that have practically destroyed the originals like Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm St, Carrie, Prom Night, Last House On The Left, The Hills Have Eyes, along with many more I can't think of right now. My point is that Hollywood NEEDS to stop ruining these great movies. If you're gonna remake such a beloved classic horror film, for fuck's sake, do it right!  Here are a handful of upcoming ""remakes"" that are either being filmed currently or in production: Stephen King's It (For the love of clowns, do this one right!), Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist (The only question I have is What took them so long?), Flatliners, Leprechaun (A reboot couldn't hurt it more than ""Leprechaun is Space"" did), The Crow, Toxic Avenger, Gremlins (Don't touch it Hollywood, please don't!), Goonies, Highlander, Jumanji (without Robin Williams there is just no point), Cliffhanger, Dirty Dancing, The Neverending Story, Mortal Kombat (In today's world so much could be done with this movie, I think an R rating is mandatory here), Waterworld (LOL!), Overboard, Weird Science, War Games, The Mummy, The Goonies (is there anybody in the world good enough to replace Chunk? That's what I thought.), Mrs Doubtfire (read Jumanji), Short Circuit, Bloodsport, Time Cop, Police Academy, Flight of the Navigator (A smack in the face of childhood!), Tomb Raider (I doubt it could be worse than the 1st one), Scarface (What do you think Al?), National Lampoon's Vacation (Randy Quaid is irreplaceable as cousin Eddie!), Honey, I Shrunk The Kids (No Rick Morranis, No Movie, period!) I can't believe how many remakes they are planning on doing! I'm still waiting for that one remake that I can say was just as good, or better than the original. After dozens and dozens of movies that Hollywood has remade, there isn't one yet, so my hope is fading fast, but it could happen, it really could! Maybe Point Break will be it, due out in July. ",0,2,Aaron Asher,HD2sz9RVzfM,0.21463963963963967,2015-02-07 00:07:09,True,True

It's goal is to make money. I mean, Apple literally releases the same exact phone every six months, they add an ""S"" to the name, maybe 1 new app and pass it off as original.

A regular ghost HAUNTING is the result of spirit energy, however poltergeist activity - also known as ""recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis"" or RSPK -  is the result of psychic energy generated (usually unconsciously) by a living person with abilities.  When they repress emotions or are under a lot of stress with no outlet to chanel that energy, it gets expelled into the atmosphere around them and eventually becomes an entity that can throw objects, burn, scratch, and make objects diappear from one place and reappear in another.

None of these things are scary to me...why not animate some ghosts?  Ghosts are scary!

Growing up, IT and the Shining, scared the #$@! out of me, but it was partially because i didnt understand what was happening. Watching those films now, its just....silly...the blood balloon in IT..lmao As i have watched classic/modern  horror films evolve to keep up with new technology and the changes in audience ""taste"", it seems as if what used to be scary...just isnt anymore. Personally, i love found footage movies. They dont even have to be scary for me to enjoy them, but the ""horror"" found footage movies, to me, have a the edge on modern or classic scary films because of their ""plausibility"" due to the way they are filmed. Granted a random SLAM! or JUMP! can still be considered a scare, but for any horror film to rely on those alone, is ultimately not going to considered ""scary"".  Poltergeist did a pretty good job of keeping some original plot elements while not only keeping up with special effects and new tech, but actually implementing those very things into the plot, which earned points. The movie however, isnt scary....and its not because its a reboot or that we have seen it before.....you cant call a reboot ""original""...it just doesnt hit the level of ""scary"" that i personally desired.  An example of a pretty good, non found footage scary film that is recent would be It Follows..... It may not have made me ""jump"" but i was genuinely scared of the plot, the idea of what the movie is .... idk, its complicated for me to articulate the proper way, but it just seems that horror movies dont do it anymore...call it desensitized or call it unoriginal... or maybe i am just a tough critic....but i am always looking for my next scare and unfortunately Poltergeist didnt deliver and just barely managed to keep my interest.

2015-10-22T01:21:13,The remake lacked emotion. In the original when the son gets dramatically taken out of his bed by the tree and almost eaten before his dad saves him. It is such a dramatic and scary scene. Then after when the family are looking for carol-ann and you can see how traumatised the son looks- he is covered in blood and mud and then hears carol-ann in the TV. He can barely speak when he tries to tell his mom. The whole scene is just so emotional. And acted so perfectly.  The remake got the tree to spawn the ability to stretch all around the house grab the son violently (without hurting him in the slightest) create the most pathetic scene ever making it look like an animation....drag him outside and throw him around abit.... Then the mom and dad get out the car and the son lands calmly down and seems ok. Lmfao. Not a single scratch on the kid. He barley seems bothered. No emotion. He seems pretty ok about it all.

2017-10-23T21:04:43,"Sam Rami (Spider-man, Drag Me To Hell)  directed this one, which is surprising,  because this one seems to make fun of  Roman Catholicism and Catholics, whereas  the other two did not.  ""I'm  trusting you"" he says to the Irish guy, who  is very priest-like.  ""Leave her alone, she's  done you no harm.""  And the evil spirits are  like, ""Y'know, that guy make a lot of sense."" .. Sort of like Neville Chamberlain exacting   that promise from Herr Hitler not to engage  in anymore land grabs.  (White people's lust  for other people's real estate, seems to know  no end.  Well, I guess they're not all like that.)   But evil spirits seem incapable of doing  something nice.  The dad almost succumbs to  an evil spirit named, Jack Daniels. ""Ok, three  shots is one too many.. thought the fawcett  was a mirror there, for a second.""  But the best,  funniest scene, was the kid's cool demeanor.   ""It's my fault because I left her alone.  I'm  going in - I got this.""  And so in he goes, into  the Vortex, attic, crawlspace, with no fears  about squirells or raccoons.  ""C'mon Maddie,  time to leave"".  Oh, and that's the other thing -  in this movie, her name is no longer Carol Ann,  but Maddie.  Why?  Why the new name?    The dvd coverart seems divinely inspired.   On the cover, you have a girl covered with  candy makeup, with Twizzlers for hair.  It is a  reference to the lust of the flesh.  One assumes  she is angry, mad even.  On the flip-side is a  picture of a girl inspecting a tv screen the way  a scientist might, with no makeup on.  A person  with thoughts and opinions, serious-minded,  so a picture symbolizing love.  Reminds me of  my Lindy, who fretted over not having lipstick  to put on, or hair to comb.  But when you love  somebody, it is not about looks, or sexual  desire - you just want that person to stay.  It is  NOT written that he broke the bread, or said  that there was blood in the cup for them to  drink from.  Catholic, and Protestant communion  rites are frankly, a lie.  People trust authority  figures and ""the group think"".  And to baptize,  or to initiate, or to circumcise, does not always  involve water, or a knife, something visible.   ""In the name of Gamma Epsilon, I haze thee.""   The world is like that, calling sexual lust normal  and good, but I do not see that in Holy Writ.   The commandment was to be fruitful and  multiply, and not, multiply and worry about  being fruitful for another day.  Having children,  biologically, is not really having children.  But  giving them The Word is, as Paul said to  Timothy, ""I have begotten you through the  Gospel"" calling him his son.  The trend in movies now is to remove the magic  and wonder, in favour of scientific explanation.   It is a reason I hate this movie, and find it  attractive.  For I like science.  But to convince  people that the devil does not exist - ""it was just  this rabid vicious squirrel"" - seems wrong.   Likewise, superheros no longer have secret   identities, but are to trust the police to protect  their loved ones as they fight evil.  What  rubbish.  For if history has taught a lesson, it  is this, you cannot trust the governments of the  ungodly, or they who claim to be godly, but  behold, they are not.. Hence, Spielberg was  forced to remake ET, digitally replacinging the  guns the FBI agents were pointing at the kids   for walkie-talkies.  I wonder if he feels shame  or anger at the compromise he made, given all  these reports of police officers using lethal  force against unarmed civilians, coming in,  these days?  The policy of the US Government  is as it was in the days of the US Cavalry - to  promote mass murder, slavery, and eugenics, as  religion.  The churches, listed in phone books,   are of the world, of cesar, of them whom the  Bible calls, the synagogue of satan.  A Catholic Apologetic ? :  ""This little one speaks  of Jesus.  We have a new Shaman now.  Sorry  kid, we can't let you go.  You're our source of  light now."" And so the movie ends with another,  more knowing of Jesus, taking her place  amongst the darkness of Village Ignorance.   ""Ok, line up for the flesh and the blood, but  only if you have had your mikvah, for the clean  cannot touch the unclean, lest he be made  unclean, again.""  Well, it is written that there must be heresies,  so that they who are approved may be made  manifest.  But I doubt this means that heretics  are excused, anymore a drunk driver who kills  a kid is excused, though God permitted it to  happen.  ""They taught me to baptize, thusly.   I vas jus' vollowing orders..""  Oh, what a tangled  web we weave, when first we set out to deceive.   The Word of God is Truth.  Mother OF Jesus.   Son OF God.  Wherefore, is She not God, also,  or the Father only?  Does it not sound like  something LOVE would do?  ""She will not know  who, or what, she really is..""  But strictly  speaking, Of, means From, or, Belonging To...  Blanket OF Jesus. Dwelling OF God.  But one  thing is for certain.  Jesus is not God.  For one  cannot be one's own son.  Like, duh.   See, John 3:34, kjv.  When people cannot read or write, they are  more willing to accept what authority figures  tell them the Bible says.  And how much  more so, when the Bible is hid from them?   And so Eugenics, ""white supremacy"", and  mysogyny is taught them.  Phrases such as  ""the chosen people"" (He did not choose a  people, but they who are chosen are a people)  and ""the holy land"" (there is no holy land, but  some places are holy, and other places holier)  have been invented, to justify theft of land  and property - the creation of a permanent  underclass, et cetra.  This word rape, like the  phrases, ""the holy land"" and ""the chosen  people"", does NOT appear in the bible, kjv.   Rearrange the letters in RAPE, and you get  REAP, which describes their attitudes towards  women and family - they see women as  breeding vessels to be ""reaped"".  And young  males who refuse to accept their fornication  (""sex without love"") faith, they label sodomites  and threaten to destroy for not joining them.   They believe that genetics, a bloodline  establishes who is accepted by God, and who  not.  They have taught for at least two thousand  years that slavery is God's will.  It is not.  But as  He allows his saints and prophets to be slain,  why should it surprise any when evil touches  a child, or people are used as slaves - as a  resource for them to build palaces with, or  otherwise indulge their fleshly, carnal appetites  with?  Why does God create evil, or allow evil to  touch others?  Why the Flood of Noah, or the  tribulations of Job?   Black America is very that movie poster art,  Al Jolson's The Jazz Singer, MADDIE, the  painted girl on the cover of the dvd,  Poltergeist - attempting to smile.   Smile, that song by Barbra Streissand -  Lindy liked that one.  But I hate it.  It sounds  cruel, a world where you have to smile, in  order to survive, to ""fit in""... ""Yea, Holy Trinity.   Merry Christmas.  Happy Easter.  Kill the  pagans, claim your land.""  Smile.  Lindy taught  me much.  The Spaniard to the Evil Kurgan  (Highlander) :  ""It's too late.  I've prepared him  for you.""    .. There is a reason Nazis  hate feminists.  And why Wonder Woman fought  against Nazis in comic books ; Today, the Nazis  attempt to hide behind Israeli flags, especially  in Apostate Christian Organizations.  It is not  your body, not your looks, but who you are on  the inside that counts.  ""You must unlearn, what you have learned.""   - Yoda.  Mr. and Mrs. Smith :  ""we're going to have to  redo every conversation""... ""I'm Jewish"".. ""I can't  believe I brought my real parents to our  wedding.""",1,0,iRena,HD2sz9RVzfM,-0.004952989718614724,2017-10-23 21:04:43,False,False
