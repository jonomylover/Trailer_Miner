The laugh and the ""I had you moment"" at the end  HOWEVER, with that said, the ""copying"" is VERY well done. And like Robert Altman said to Paul Thomas Anderson after Anderson told to Altman that ""All I do is rip you off"" when he makes movies, the only way you can steal someone's work is if you actually take someone's finished work, cross his name from the credits and write your own name over it. Everything else is inspiration and Scorsese has countless inspirations in his work. You can find dozens of videos here on Youtube where he talks about hundreds of movies that have inspired him throughout his life. If you want an example from GoodFellas, he openly states in one of the videos that De Niro's ""acting with his eyes"" while smoking a cigarette moment in GoodFellas was inspired by the acting style from the film The Tales of Hoffmann.  And speaking of GoodFellas, anyone else think that Depp both looks and sounds like Ray Liotta in the trailer.

If you're serious about the art of film and stuff, listen to this review if you're thinking about seeing it and obviously this is just my opinion, but here goes anyway. This movie isn't very good. The cast is stacked throughout with male actors who give solid performances but I doubt anyone didn't expect that. For how intimidating and violent the film is advertised, the movie actually has a rather monotone mood throughout. This leads into the key and most crucial aspect of this films downfall to me which is that there is no main character in the film to tie yourself too. For it being portrayed as all about whitey bulger, the film actually isn't centralized around any one character. It's no ones story and without that in a film, there's little to deliver other than facts. Rotten tomatoes gave it a 78. Trust me when I say that I strongly believe the cast has to do with that success.

His laughter is exactly like mine except I tried not to laugh so often and hide it, not show that real side of me. Anyway, the scenes shows mostly his vulgar side, such as in the bedroom of his best friend. He doesn't even knock on the door and politely ask. Instead, he acts like he was king of that house and turns the locked door knob several times. When she opens the door, she sees him and tries to wedge the door in between them. He stops her from doing that. He enters into her private bedroom without permission and starts a mini conversation with her. He caresses the side of her face and he massages her throat. She, of course, didn't think highly of his massage. She felt more like he was going to choke and strangle her and feared him. He loved it! You can tell right there and then he was summing her up. As he leaves, he turns around, smiles, and looks at her, expressing his envious at what a catch his best friend has --- the ideal trophy wife who won't retaliate against him(as like his current woman).",0,0,Chris John P.

Scott cooper was okay but he didn't really show much drama in it  ... they should of work close with the real Kevin Weeks Or John Martorano who were colse to Bulger to make it a classic, i mean Johnny deep was amazing i love his performance but the writers didn't really do much smh all the other cast members were great as well ... this movie should of been at least 3 hours long to really show who bulger was and add his early criminal career ... Like when he met Howie Winter (the second boss of the infamous Winter Hill Gang)or when he was in Alcatraz and so on ... and was up with the cut-scenes ? they cut out a few good ones  smh plus Sienna Miller didn't make the finale cut  as Catherine Greig ""whitey"" Girlfriend ... another thing Kevin weeks wasn't feeling the film, Weeks took offense to many parts of Black Mass, particularly scenes showing him doing things he says he never did. He said the film makes the death of Bulger's son, Douglas, seem like it occurred much later (1975) than 1973, and that it was a turning point for Bulger's crimes. Kevin Weeks met Bulger while working as a bouncer in 1976 (NOT 1975) at the Boston bar Triple O's, where Bulger constantly held court.He soon became Bulger's driver and stand-over man, before joining the the Winter Hill Gang full-time in 1982, where he stayed until his arrest in 1999. Weeks also said that John Martorano was never in Triple O‚Äôs. Second, if Whitey ever started talking to Johnny like that‚Äîberating him‚Äîthe movie would be over because Johnny would‚Äôve shot him right then. As bad as Whitey was, Johnny was just as capable‚Äîif not more.

It's like he exists purely to cause misery, not to enrich himself and live a nice life. He was a guy who made good money and had connections with important people (apparently he was an FBI informant for years) that allowed him to run a criminal enterprise. He was in a world where killing happened as part of the game.    Does this mean he goes around like a monster every waking minute? Why is he made out to be a devil, whereas other mob movies show the mobsters enjoying the fruits of their labour? This movie is tacky and unrealistic IMO.   Pablo Escobar was responsible for far more death, torturing, misery, and evil and he isn't portrayed like this. It is so weird that it makes it uncomfortable to watch because they totally dehumanize Whitey. They make him look like someone who gets no pleasure from anything in life, but in causing pain, just like some evil comic book villain stereotype.",0,1,Kool Sul,CE3e3hGF2jc,-0.013140692640692642,2018-11-02 19:16:47,False,False
