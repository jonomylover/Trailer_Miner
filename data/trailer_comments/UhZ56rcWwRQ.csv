There needs to be so much more restraint. There are only 2 or 3 really spectacular moments in the story. The rest should be tense but not overblown. All this day-glo sugar rush production crap is completely wrong for anything Madeleine L‚ÄôEngle authored. Her work is about ideas, not spectacle for its own sake.   I also have to say that the controversial casting bothers me - not because I have any objection to a ‚Äúmixed-race‚Äù lead. (I hate that term - we are all the same human race.) Anyway, I just object to warping characters in a misguided political statement. Katniss Everdeen SHOULD have been of a broader heritage - because she was written that way. Meg Murry was written as a plain European heritage American girl with mousy brown straight hair and glasses so thick she was virtually blind without them. But she had a charisma about her personality that let you know that maturity would bring beauty. Calvin was tall, lanky, blatantly poor, and shockingly redheaded. And the angelic trio are completely wrong as well. They should look more like Professor Trelawney, or the junk lady from Labyrinth - not the tailored, coiffed, and over made creations of this production.   I have to see the movie, because it‚Äôs Madeleine L‚ÄôEngle. I really hope I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised.

I'm don't think this movie will do very good and live on to be a classic, also,   Stop it with the lettuce monster, remove it from the movie, I would rather have the movie be delayed so they can remove that stupid leaf flying thing and reshoot it for what was in‚Äã the book preferably but anything would be better than that crap flying lettuce. It is described as being a beautiful thing and that thing is ugly. Stop.   I'll probably just go to the bathroom during that part or something.

2017-11-20T19:39:18,"Madeleine L'Engle wrote an engaging fairy tale.  A true fairy tale full of inexpiable deus ex machina. I have to wonder if getting the Disney treatment will be as bad for this tale as it was for a lot of the classic fairy tales.  Face it, if a movie was made of the tales documented by the Brother's Grimm without expurgating a lot it would have an R rating. And, yes I like Wrinkle in Time.  No, I don't call it science fiction as it is at the bedrock anti-science.  Belief and will will alter reality type of mindset. I own a copy of the first movie version from 2003 and really enjoy it.  But with the Disney history, they will attach a musical score and the good storytelling version will be lost in a marketing campaign.  I, personally, hate when they edit a story and release the book version to make the story conform to the music script instead of the original.  I wouldn't be surprised if the L'Engle stories don't get that treatment too. 2003 version: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290382/?ref_=nv_sr_2",1,0,Steven Jerkins,UhZ56rcWwRQ,0.1685897435897436,2017-11-20 19:39:18,True,True

The big one being the character of Meg, Now please correct me if I'm wrong but in the book Meg was the definition of uncertain youth and awkward teen, not in the physical sense but in the social sense She didn't know how to act and was constantly worried about what others thought of her and that included Calvin. (Who I didn't see enough of to really get the sense of his character.) My concern comes from the color change in the character, which in and of itself I don't have a problem with but in the trailer she seems like she's pretty confident and self assured in the scenes when she's explaining the Wrinkle thing and taking the lead heading down the street for example. I just hope they aren't taking that character of being the awkward outsider and out of the norm teen who over the course of a fairly short story becomes a person of confidence and even though she isn't as self assured as she may like she's willing and able to face the challenges ahead and replacing it with I'm a person of color therefore not part of the group. Now I want to state this perfectly clear, I have Zero issue with the change in skin tone, that really means absolutely nothing to me I just don't want this character I found relatable and inspiring and to be turned into what I fear may be a shallow character. Of course this is just the first trailer And perhaps not a great representation of what we can expect from the characters in the actual film.",0,0,Daniel Walton,UhZ56rcWwRQ,0.022222222222222223,2017-11-21 03:27:10,True,True

Also, 'A Wrinkle In Time' is about accepting the flaws of humans and trying not to make everyone perfect. That's literally what the book is about, which is why it was banned. Flaws *are* what makes us human. Take that away, and we're just robots. But this preview captures none of that.

It is a storm created in each adult persons mind since childhood and it determines the future. Space is the nerves the are dormant in each person's brain that are awaken and formed by time through a high state of mind. What I mean about high state of mind is when a person put themselves in another world just like television or the next trend that is formed. Great minds creates a great destiny in the conscious world and a sad negative mind will face karma. Handling a negative moment takes a tremendous amount of calmness and humble for time to change itself but it will over time. :),0,0,Tony thinom,UhZ56rcWwRQ,0.05741228070175439,2017-11-21 16:23:09,True,True

But is anyone else a little put off by the sudden thematic tone shift even in the trailer? Like look at the setup for a second. It's a fantasy adventure movie that is using science, namely theoretical physics, as its jumping off point. Which is actually way cool since stories about children, women, and people of color don't often get roles in stories focused on science... but then it ditches it halfway through in favor of what looks to be generic fantasy adventure without any links to science or the power of knowledge or anything.

2017-11-22T01:20:09,So here is how this movie is gonna go If you have seen a movie before you can already tell what it‚Äôs gonna be about  1. Introduces characters  2. Introduces problem 3. introduces a wise older character that adds exposition and guidance to the younger characters  4. Wiser older character tells main character that there‚Äôs an evil bad thing that needs to be stopped and she‚Äôs the only one who can do it.  You can already tell what‚Äôs gonna happen just by watching the trailer. Especially at the end where you see them running from an explosion most likely at the end of the movie right before they defeat the bad thing which they obviously will since this movie clich√© as shit. And obviously they have to have the line ‚Äúdo you trust me‚Äù because that‚Äôs obviously an original line of dialogue that won‚Äôt make most audiences cringe. The second act will be filled with exposition about the world they are living in with a few action scenes sprinkled in and at the end they have there big battle and they save the day. And obviously the main actress won‚Äôt die cause this is an action film and why would you surprise anyone?  Also there‚Äôs gonna be an emotional scene with the dad which won‚Äôt make me cry cause I‚Äôll see it coming from a mile away just like any death in this film most likely.

2017-12-23T12:12:39,"PLOT SUMMARY: Thirteen-year-old Meg Murry's classmates and teachers see her as a troublesome and stubborn student. Her family knows that she is emotionally immature but also sees her capable of doing great things. The family includes her beautiful scientist mother, her missing scientist father, her athletic 10-year-old twin brothers, Sandy and Dennys; and her five-year-old brother Charles Wallace Murry, a child prodigy genius who can sometimes read Meg's mind.  The book begins with the line ""It was a dark and stormy night,"" an allusion to the opening words in Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1830 novel Paul Clifford. Unable to sleep during a thunderstorm, Meg descends from her attic room to find Charles Wallace sitting at the table drinking milk and eating bread and jam. They are then joined by their mother, and are visited by their new eccentric neighbor, Mrs Whatsit. In the course of conversation, Mrs Whatsit casually mentions there is such a thing as a tesseract, which causes Dr. Murry to almost faint.  The next morning, Meg discovers the term refers to a scientific concept her father was working on before his mysterious disappearance. The following afternoon, Meg and Charles Wallace encounter Meg's schoolmate, Calvin O'Keefe, a high-school junior who, although he is a ""big man on campus"", considers himself a misfit as well. They then go to visit an old haunted house near town which Charles Wallace already knows is the home of Mrs Whatsit. There they encounter a companion of Mrs Whatsit, the equally strange Mrs Who. She promises that she and her friends will help Meg find and rescue her father. A budding love interest develops between Meg and Calvin. In the evening, Charles Wallace declares it is time for them to go on their mission to save their father. This is accompanied by the appearance of the third member of the ""Mrs Ws"", Mrs Which, who appears to materialize out of nothing.  Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which turn out to be supernatural beings who transport Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe through the universe by means of tesseract, a fifth-dimensional phenomenon explained as being similar to folding the fabric of space and time. Their first stop is the planet Uriel, a Utopian world filled with Centaur-like beings who live in a state of light and love. Mrs Whatsit herself shows that she, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which are all these centaur-like creatures in disguise as humans. There the ""Mrs Ws"" reveal to the children that the universe is under attack from an evil being who appears as a large dark cloud called The Black Thing, which is essentially the personification of evil. The children are then taken elsewhere to visit a woman who is a medium (the ""Happy Medium"") with a crystal ball. In it, they see that Earth is partially covered by the darkness, although great religious figures, philosophers, and artists have been fighting against it. Mrs Whatsit is revealed to be a former star who exploded in an act of self-sacrifice to fight the darkness.  The children then travel to the dark planet of Camazotz, which has ""given in"" to the Black Thing. Meg's father is trapped there. They find that all the inhabitants behave in a mechanistic way and seem to be under the control of a single mind. At the planet's central headquarters (described as CENTRAL Central Intelligence), they discover a red-eyed man with telepathic abilities who can cast a hypnotic spell over their minds. He claims to know the whereabouts of their father. Charles Wallace deliberately looks into the red eyes of the man, allowing himself to be taken over by the mind controlling planet in order to find their father. Under its influence, he takes Meg and Calvin to the place where Dr. Murry is being held prisoner because he would not succumb to the group mind.  The planet turns out to be controlled by an evil disembodied brain with powerful abilities, which the inhabitants of Camazotz call ""IT."" Charles Wallace takes them to the place where IT is held. In such proximity to IT, the children are threatened by a possible telepathic takeover of their minds. With special powers from Mrs Who's glasses, Dr. Murry is able to ""tesser"" Calvin, Meg and himself away from Camazotz, but Charles Wallace is left behind, still under the influence of IT. Dr. Murry does not know how to protect Meg from the Black Thing which surrounds the planet as they tesser through it, which nearly kills her. When they arrive on the neighboring planet of Ixchel, Meg is nearly frozen, and paralyzed. Calvin and the Murrys are discovered by the planet's inhabitants - large, sightless ""beasts"" with tentacles and four arms, who prove both wise and gentle. Meg's paralysis is cured under the care of one inhabitant, whom Meg nicknames ""Aunt Beast."" Meg overcomes her anger at her father for leaving Charles Wallace on Camazotz, realizing that parents can't fix everything, and sometimes children can solve problems themselves.  Then the trio of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which arrive. They charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT, because only Meg has a strong enough bond with him. Their father had last seen Charles Wallace when he was a baby and Calvin had only just met him. They each give her a gift. Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love. Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God choosing the foolish of the world to confound the wise, and the weak to defeat the strong (1st Corinthians 1:27-29). Mrs Which tells Meg that she has one thing that IT does not have. Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed, Charles Wallace is still there under IT's influence. Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love. She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. Mrs Who, Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth. In the vegetable garden they are reunited with Mrs. Murry and the twins. Mrs Whatsit says that, although she and the others like the spectacle of the family reuniting, they have to go somewhere. Before Mrs Whatsit finishes her sentence, she and the others disappear.",0,3,Kaze's Corner,UhZ56rcWwRQ,0.06942008208241976,2017-12-23 12:12:39,True,True

2018-03-08T00:08:39,"I had commented this before on  one of the trailers for this movie, I forget which but it's not important. What I think is important is how I see much of the criticism being put to this movie is being dismissed as ""Oh well you're just mad because Meg is black"" or on the other side of the fence ""Why is Meg black now that's racist."" I think like the focus on race is taking away from what I feel is a real flaw in the book. Yes Meg was a white girl in the book, yes they changed that and I honestly couldn't care less about skin tone, what bothers me is the apparent change in Meg's character. Meg was the epitome of awkward teenager, she was clumsy, unsure of herself and her place in the microcosm that is school (high school or middle school again makes no real difference) much less her place in the larger world. Meg spoke to me on a personal level and I related to her through, what seemed to me, a remarkable description of what it's like to be inside the head of a young person. Meg in this movie appears to be very confident in herself, taking the reigns and leading the charge as it were. Now I understand that this change is likely meant to be empowering to young girls and show that they can have the same goals of leadership and fearlessness as they see in male lead roles, but that wasn't the point of Meg, she didn't overcome her flaws and win the day, she won the day despite her flaws. At the end of the book she is more confident and sure of herself but she had those flaws as an obstacle in the first place and they remained with her even if they didn't hold her as tightly. Admittedly this is just my impressions from the trailer and there could be more to Meg's character than what I took away from this short bit and it has been many years since I read the book so as with most opinions this is all subject to change, But I just wanted to throw that out there once again that to me it's not about changing the character's race, it's about changing the character.

2018-04-05T04:27:22,"A Wrinkle In Time. For some reason the kids from the book turned black. Wow. Amazing. I see a perfect transition here. Not a weird fucking agenda to manipulate audiences. No huge compromises possibly looming hidden in it's darkness. All probably at the discretion of a big fat pig of a cow name Oprah. Why the fuck is Oprah in this? She lives in a goddamn fantasy land I'll tell you. It was obvious in an interaction she had one time where an old man said he couldn't afford his medicine and she said to him, ""Well, why don't you just buy it?"" This cunt wanted to say why don't you just order your assistants (or servants) to go out and get it for you? She doesn't know what real people have to deal with and that they have money problems. She is that far fucking removed from reality, she is not even human. So why put her in this. A book about the perseverance of the human spirit. She is more like the all powerful demon god in it. Except less brains. It would be a god made of fat. Another reason she is in fantasy land. She is a spokesperson for a weight loss company. Lols üòÖüòÖü§£ She has gained and lost, only through extreme surgery, that no one else can afford, and is also dangerous, the equivalent weight of a thousand normal people. How the fuck are you gonna be morbidly obese and a weight loss expert. Also how is it physically possible to lose the weight she has lost in the past, after just a short hiatus, without dying from extreme exercise, and unhealthy levels of dieting. The answer is you get your big fat pig of an ass sucked out, over and over and over and over and over again, ect, ect. Yeah, she should play the monster. She plays one in real life. I also don't care about politics. But I can recognize a fat greedy money sucking demon with an agenda, and zero relation to humanity.

2018-05-18T11:26:55,"Being a lover of fantasy/sci-fi, being a huge Disney fan and having read and loved the book a while ago, part of me was really hoping that 'A Wrinkle in Time' would be much better than the pretty strange on paper cast and the terrible trailer suggested.   Sadly to no avail. Disney have done so many very good to masterpiece films, but with 'A Wrinkle in Time' they have misfired...big time. It hurts me a lot to describe a Disney film as terrible, a distinction very rarely associated with them, but that is a very good way to sum up 'A Wrinkle in Time'. That it is a poor adaptation of the book, which had far more wonder and charm not to mention coherence, is a problem, but not as big a problem as the major flaws that make the film terrible on its own terms.   The spirited performance of Storm Reid, who makes a real effort giving her role energy and likeability and does quite well, and that from Chris Pine are the only things that stop 'A Wrinkle in Time' from being an even bigger disaster.  Cannot say the same for the rest of the cast. Questioned a good deal of the casting choices before watching the film, having doubts that they would suit their roles. Doubts that were proven correct. The other children don't have strong enough presences and inexperience shows, but the adult actors fare worse. On one side of the spectrum you have very exaggerated, annoying acting, Mindy Kaling being a prime example, and on the other you have truly insipid and phoned in acting, the biggest offender being Oprah Winfrey. Didn't care for the characters and the conflict doesn't work when the heroes are bland and lack charm generally and the villains are exaggerated and lack menace.   'A Wrinkle in Time' doesn't even look good, with it looking worse than a low-budget television film (Disney Channel musicals look better!). The effects (of which there is too much of an over-reliance on) are worse than cheap, worse than those from fantasy/magic-themed family shows from twenty plus years ago, and marred further by photography and editing that will make one nauseated. The sets are colourful but not in a vibrant or appealing way, rather tacky and garish. And why Winfrey, Kaling and Reese Witherspoon (also annoying) were made to look like drag queens or something out of a cheesy 80s music video is beyond my understanding, by far the worst cases of costuming, make-up and hair in a film taking bizarre to extremes in that aspect.   Nothing dynamic, whimsical, energetic, nuanced or atmospheric about the music. Much of it doesn't fit, and it's either saccharine, over-bearing or tacky, in its own right it doesn't appeal. Was expecting much better directing from the same director responsible for 'Selma', it was very muddled and it was hard to tell whether her heart was in it or whether she was taking on more than she could chew (am suspecting both).  Excepting Reid's and Pine's characters, the only characters to have some kind of heart, the characters generally bore and irritate. The script and story are particularly bad, with the script falling on the wrong side frequently of cheesy, awkward and twee complete with heavy-handed moralising. The message is an admirable one but beats the viewer around the head to the point one feels preached at. The pace feels both rushed and flagging, with the action rarely coming to life let alone soaring.  The story tries to be ambitious but there is too much of a too hard feel, trying to fit in too much and not having a long enough running time to tell it. There was a heart somewhere in the film and it's occasionally there with the whole finding-father stuff, but that is lost amidst all the above stated problems and that the story is far too choppy that it affects the coherence and sometimes ridiculous. Detected very little charm here and actually felt more tired by the film rather than enchanted.   Overall, excepting two performances 'A Wrinkle of Time' was a mess and a rare Disney misfire.",0,0,Dave Kendall,UhZ56rcWwRQ,0.026775793650793654,2018-05-18 11:26:55,False,True

2018-07-13T22:04:21,"Exploring the possibility that Charles Wallace is black, is like Bloom Count, remember Oliver?  Room temperature fusion?  Superconductors?  Why not?  Well, there were a few platinum blond haired men at my highschool.  I remember Charles living across the street when I was young.  Some of the men had AP scores that were like, all 5's.   Then I let slip one day, a classmate I can't recall, oh, yeah he was too smart to take Calculus in highschool.   He graduated with trigonometry and analytic geometry which closer to traditional.  It's covered by the SAT subject tests, as well as statistics, not Calculus.  Anyway, I don't think it's Trey Reyher or David D'Angelo.  Better at history than anyone in my class.  Part of it is that I have a family that wanted to force the students in my class to retake algebra in college, which does not count towards credit towards a major at a university.  Also, AS and AA, which are offered at community colleges, have traditionally been terminal degrees.  That does not mean ""dead.""  It means they aren't supposed to use them to apply to a bachelor's program.  Allowing people who finish those programs to go on to 4 year schools caused some of the confusion. The University of Florida, I realize, even shows favoritism towards students coming in with an associates degree, which is a disaster.   That's what they started to do with David Bloomquist in charge of admissions.  UF offerred scholarship money.  Not worth it.  Everyone warned me, my highschool friends, Auburn or FSU.  I just assumed they were jealous of the National Merit Scholarship.  If I were really good they would have said Georgia Tech.  Maybe.  Dr Bruce Edwards complained that the community college entrants were a problem because 40% of them flunk out of math. Also, the dual enrollment credit I took between NWFSC and Niceville High School my senior year in highschool is a disaster.  UF thinks I was an AS student.  The records for my year of admission to UF are 2 years behind.  Most of the dual enrollment credit classes were taken at NHS.  I attended class at NWFS for one day, which I didn't think was significant at the time.  Also, my mother took a music class there, so I went with her to NWFS when I was on vacation during my first 2 years at UF.  I was not registered for the class and what I was doing was breaking the law, because I attended a class for which I was not registered with NWFSC.  You can't attend class you haven't paid for. Btw, the reason I looked at Erin Green's science test in the 8th grade is that I didn't buy she was crashing and burning.  I noticed she had no red ink on a test where nobody else got a perfect score and she kept writing faster than everyone else.  I muttered ""How did you know the answer to that?""

It‚Äôs admirable for Oprah and the others that participated in such a deliberate film that deals with the laws of the Universe & The laws of attraction. This is NO FAIRYTALE.

The teachings of Abraham Hicks.  I would say that about 15% of the entire world population is aware of the teachings. The rest may never benefit from them. We are far more than these physical bodies. God/Light is our inner being/Soul as humans usually call it. Broaden your minds. Expansion, Joy and Love is the key. This happens to be a remarkable film.

See, our minds have been subjugated and conditioned from birth to accept only one type of consciousness, the truth of reality however is not only stranger than you suppose it's stranger than you CAN suppose. Spiritual beings having a human experience, you've just forgotten that's all. Films like this and avatar are a 21st century way of conveying truths through the medium of story telling.  Yeah I saw a lot of cringey stuff in this film but hey I get it all the same and kudos to the makers for putting this out there.

2019-06-10T17:43:25,"So was this movie as bad as it looks? I just now heard about it and thought I'd check it out. But a few things bothered me: 1. The whole thing about folding space and time has been done, almost word for word, in a wide variety of TV shows and movies. Yawn. 2. The whole 'father isn't dead, he just disappeared' thing has also been done a million times. It's been done with brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, too. It even happened to the late Robin Williams in ""Jumanji"".  It's one of the most over-used tropes out there. 3. Oprah?!? I'm sorry but trying to ignore that Oprah is Oprah and not some odd looking 'god' is all but impossible. She's unique in that way. 4. I LOVE Mindy Kahling. She's an absolute comedic genius. ""The Office"" was never the same after she stopped writing for it as well as acting in it. She's such a brilliant person and I have more respect for her than anyone else in Hollywood but this is not a good role for her unless she actually is playing a cornballish 'god' that the previews don't show. 5. The kids seem OK from what I can see. The lead girl, Storm Reid, seems quite believable and likable. 6. The effects look like they're out of a 2008 video game but they're not bad in a SyFy channel sort a way. 7. And lets not forget Reese Witherspoon. 1:13 That has got to be some of the worst acting by her I've ever seen. Oh man is that bad.
