2014-10-17T02:48:47,"Just watched this movie and it was fun! Now I can't help noticing some of the complaints about it so I'd like to leave something for anyone reading to think about.  1. ""The dads are being portrayed as incapable of taking care of their kids."" Well, dads need a reason to enjoy the movie as well, and let's face it, if you bash the movie for showing incompetant fathers that means you're disagreeing with the idea that dads can make mistakes too. If the kids can drive mom up the wall there's no reason they wouldn't do the same to dad.  2. ""They're bad parents just letting their kids run amok."" That's not bad parenting. I myself can recall two instances when I was little when my parents lost sight of me, one of those was because of my own choice to wander off. That's not bad parenting, that's the individuality of a child. It is easy to forget that children have minds of their own, minds to young yet to understand when their parents need peace of mind from the screaming, quarrelling, or mess making day to day in a curious young human's life. You can't expect all children to be perfect angels or conform to your way of thinking and certainly they don't have any concept of orderlyness. Honestly half the time even adults will fail at being 'grown up'...its overrated anyway.  3. ""oh it's anti-feminist"" Uh, no. The movie is focused mainly on one mother, whose dream it was to be a mother, and not understanding why even though she had what she wanted she didn't seem to be happy but rather stressed out all the time. That's not anti-feminist, that's a very real thing among devoted stay at home moms. It's actually rather anti-feminist to claim anti-feminism against women who genuinely want to be stay at home moms because to them that is their dream. I mean, when you achieve eqaulity between the sexes isn't it technically a by product for women to live their dreams no matter what they are?  4. ""the movie wasn't funny"" well not all humor is the same so maybe you have a different taste or you didn't watch the movie I say that because its hard to tell when someone has been honest or simply trolling. For me it has to do with taste, mature jokes are only labeled that nowadays because kids aren't sposed to hear them. Does that make them mature or just juvenilism for adults? That's why I like this movie, nothing in the humorous content made me feel like I lost any IQ points from a cringe inducing inuendo or fart joke and there was a wonderful absense of swearing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against swearing I just like it when it's tasteful, in a comedy especially it just seems either forced or overbearing so much as to take away from the experience.  5. ""oh no another Christian movie trying to sell us something""...so what? Secular Hollywood is always trying to sell you something too, theirs just happens to be product placement and materialistic obsessions, case in point Man of Steel with it's very painful advertisements in the final fight scenes. Plus, plenty of Christians will watch secular movies that they may or may not end up enjoying so why not secularists sit down to a Christian movie every now and then? What's the worse thing that the movie will do to you? Its not like it has teeth or something, you'll still have your life and possessions at the end of the day, friends with whom you can bemoan life with, the world's not gonna end just cause you watched a movie.  In conclusion, quite frankly you're all melodramatic, XD  Also, in case you want to accuse me of something, no I am not a mother but I am a girl, yes I am a Christian so yes I may be biased in my view of this film but that is not grounds to throw out what I have said if any of you found agreement or meaning with my words. As the saying goes, eat the meat and spit out the bones, take what you want and leave the rest.  Cheers.",0,0,Deity1,Q2gnLXW7X-0,0.09673520923520922,2014-10-17 02:48:47,False,False
