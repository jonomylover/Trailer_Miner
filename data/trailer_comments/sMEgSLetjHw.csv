2016-07-06T18:25:53,"This is definitely the Blair Witch Project 3. Listen to this. One, the setting is easily set up just like the Blair Witch Project, huge forest, found footage, and friends that go camping and hiking. Two, about a year ago it was rumored that a Blair Witch Project 3 was filming so it would make sense that this is what they were filming. Even the original Blair Witch director talked about it and how it's inevitable. Three, I know it's way out there but search up ""McFarlane Toys -  Blair Witch Project Action Figure"" and you'll find a figure that is shaped like a person but looks like a tree with claw hands. The action figure is obviously the Blair Witch. Now, if you look closely in this trailer in slow motion at the parts where everything goes wrong, you see tents being picked up by tree-like, claw-like hands. That is the exact same hand of the McFarlane action figure, which is the Blair Witch. The Blair Witch is picking up their tents and throwing them. Four, this one really seals the deal. If you pause at the right moment at 1:14, you see a man running out of a tent with trees everywhere and his tent being picked up. If you look to the left of him, you see a hanging figure from the tree right next to him which appears to be one of the hanging Blair Witch figures from the first film. They look almost identical. Five, the parasitic thingy coming out of the leg is probably something used by the Blair Witch to weaken individuals so they are now vulnerable. This shows that this is most definitely a Blair Witch sequel although I am not quite sure at what the glowing light at the end of the trailer is.",35,10,James Mitchell,sMEgSLetjHw,0.11999007936507937,2016-07-06 18:25:53,True,True
