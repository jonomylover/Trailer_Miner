I love how the villains are always pirates that are cursed or supernaturally evil in some way based on classic pirate legends or myths(with the exception of Beckett and the EIC, of course).  First it was skeleton pirates, then Davy Jones and his fish-people, then zombies led by Blackbeard, and now ghost pirates, and all of them so far have been awesome and unique not only within the PotC universe, but in the world of cinema in general.  Davy Jones and his crew have been my favorites so far, but Javier Bardem is a fantastic actor, and these new bad guys look like they'll be just as badass and creepy as the others.

2016-10-03T07:13:54,"JUST USE JACK'S DAD STORY AND ROLL WITH IT!  Like, seriously - the only time Jack was out of words and felt really little, was being close to his immortal father! The one who actually seeded him the idea to search the seas andto  become immortal! The one, who actually killed Jack's mother and carries it along with him. That... is just trauma after trauma and we just know that Jack has amazing humorous mental walls up to keep away the feelings of angst & the insanity of his childhood. A father and son story, so terrible would be awesome to explore and write upon.  Bring the ghost out of the closet. It was sad to see, how they totally misused Jack's Dad in the last movie..., such ""Hey, look we brought someone familiar back for money-driven reasons, no character development this time, folks!"" Just a stare, a bit of mumble jumble. Really unbelievable dialogue.  Bottom line - Jack's dad is cool, but also... the one who made somekind of ultimate price Jack fears, he doesn't have it in him to do to become also immortal. And if actually Jack despises his dad for the way he did become immortal, than maybe Jack would only do it, to find a way to best him, maybe act upon revenge for treating his mother in such a way or... whatever really. :D  Just would be cool to see a human face a god, who became one in a way Jack would never.   I mean the last one clearly showed, that Jack's dad had the ability to be everywhere (omnipresent), is immortal by the discoveries of the 3. movie. That's gonna be really hard to fight.  Ok, but let's leave the skull aside. Maybe Jack's dad is like Jack - just a bit weird. Maybe her mother was actually dead long ago and he just carries her along in his infinite existence. Wow.... that would.. nagh - doesn't make sense because Jack is alive. Her mother should be alive not dead by natural causes. So there definitely was something there.  Or maybe Jack's dad wanted to gift Jack's mom all the godly abilites he had also obtained but something went disasterously wrong. In that moment, he didn't wish the same to happen to his son, so that is why he always warns his son on the journeys of wanting to become immortal. :)",0,0,Kaspar Tambur,KpFMVcZ4o7U,0.06754261363636366,2016-10-03 07:13:54,True,True

Holy shit, this looks exactly like the kind of movie people say is ""made to win Razzies."" I was looking forward to this, kind of, but now I'm just wondering how awful it actually will be. Enough to get single-digits on Rotten Tomatoes, perhaps. And was it the video quality or did the CGI look REALLY terrible? Once again, Gods of Egypt. I predict this will end up being the final nail in the coffin of the Pirates franchise, the same way Terminator Genysys was the final nail in the coffin of the Terminator franchise.  ;(  After his shocking Transcendence snub, maybe this will finally deliver Johnny Depp his overdue Razzie. Mortdecai (NO apologies at all if it's misspelled!), Alice In Wonderland, Dark Shadows, The Tourist, The Rum Diary, Tusk, Yoga Hosers cameo, maybe The Astronaut's Wife, he has been in so many flops and been terrible so often lately, that like Nicholas Cage, another actor WAAAAYYY more overdue for some Razzie recognition, he has actually been bringing his whole career down in general with all the shitty choices he has made. Which is sad because both are great actors, Depp was magnificent in Edward Siccorhands, IN MY HONEST PERSONAL OPINION Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and the 1st Pirates movie, for which I will always argue he should have won the Academy Award, especially over winner Sean Penn's whiny work in Mystic River and Bill Murray's boring non-performance in Lost In Translation.",0,0,Jacob Davis,KpFMVcZ4o7U,-0.009856630824372764,2016-10-03 08:34:28,True,True

The first film was loads of fun, the second and third made no goddamn sense and the fourth was just a shitty action movie. You're flogging a horse so dead its skeleton has decomposed. Realistically, many people will pay to see it, but that's just because they loved the first film and over-optimistically hope for a return to form, which will probably never happen. You'll get terrible reviews and you'll try again every five years, further embarrassing Disney and shitting all over the first film. It's seriously difficult to enjoy the first film knowing it's part of the same series as three (and probably now four) utter pieces of shit. Just use your budget to make a great original film. You'll probably get the same amount of money either way, but this way you'll have integrity. If you absolutely must turn this series into James Bond, just understand why everyone loves the first film. It's not because of its action, its fantasy, its deep and complex characters, or its many deep and complex subplots. It's simply because it's loads of fun. When you try to make a POTC film driven by those former elements, you epically fail.

You know i can totally Imagine Jack reacting totally Chill to the news that someone is out to get him. Like ''Are you Jack Sparrow? Yeah, there's this Ghost Pirate out to get you and kill you!'' And Jack is like ''I've had Skeletons, fishpeople and Zombies come after me... Now there's Ghosts. Wonder what the allmighty has planed for me next''. But naturally Jack will be freaked the fuck out once he sees these ghost pirates. But this time he has a imortal companion on his side. Yeah... The Captain of the Flying Dutchman... William Turner. Captain William Turner! And i'm sure he'll get the Pearl Back at some point. And Barbosa allways gets mixed up in Jack's shit. So we'll have 3 Legendary ships teaming up... The Black Pearl, The Flying Dutchman and The Queen Anna's Revenge. You know i'm really loving that idea. But interesting detail to note... The Bady ship allways ends up in the hands of one of the heroes. Barbose may not count as a hero bot he acts the part every now and then. Wonder who will get the bady ship this time.   And wonder if Jack will beat his new enemy in one film or if we are looking at another 2 parter. Because i can't see them having to many more ideas for a special kind of crew. Davy Jones and his crew was allready pretty far out there. Ghost's is the logical next step. So what more would they do afte this? Ok Dead Man's Chest and At World's End had a very interesting idea. Davy Jones wasn't really the main bad guy. He was a neutral party that had a beef with the hero and was used by the actual Bad guy in the end. So really it was a shitty little political asswhipe that was the main baf guy. But there has to be some kind of supernatural aspect for the heroes to overcome in a Pirates film. I do think Mermaids is something they can use again.... I mean they did play a key role in the last film. But we never got to see a big ship fight with them. We only got to see them pull down a ship. Imagine a battle like the Kraken Battles in Dead Man's Chest. That's still one of the coolest things they've done. My favorite battle is still the Pearl Dutchman fight at the end of At Worlds End... That fight is just so fucking insane and out there that it's just nothing but sweet. You Have Barbosa vs Davy Jones at first... Then Jack vs Davy. Still get chills just thinking about ut.

That Jonny Depp played as Captain Jack Sparrow that a writer makes his performances smart and interesting character. To a sequel that makes Jack acting performing making him more ridiculous to himself.   Disney studio filmmaking is drinking too much plot holes that make's an uninteresting writer drunk, including the directors, which makes Jonny that he still have to play Jack Sparrow for the next year 2017. Will make him more ridiculous to himself that which I feel a poor soul of these actors who works there heart out even to this day.      This has to stop because there making to much.   As an honest Disney fan ( that I once was). The creators of this film need to go to rehab for their creativity.  Take a day off and rethink themselves before they make more film.

Seguro que la mayoría recurrirá al usado argumento de que su esposa, Penélope Cruz, erradicó cualquier atisbo de calidad en la quinta entrega. Cierto es que ""En mareas misteriosas"" no fue tan buena como las demás, pero esta no es excusa para dejar caer el peso de la culpa sobre una única persona. Hubo vacíos en el guión, monotonía, escasez de ideas y algunos inconvenientes más. Quizá Penélope no es una actriz que lo borde en sus interpretaciones, a mi por ejemplo nunca me ha llamado la atención su forma de actuar, pero no por eso debemos de llegar a la conclusión de que este suceso lo provocó ella y mucho menos que su marido la pifiará en la sexta entrega.

2016-10-08T03:54:35,"I think the main reason I loathed POTC 4 was after the amazing maelstrom sea battle and even the bit after with Pearl and Dutchman vs Endeavour, OST didn't have any action scenes near that scope. Plus why did ""The Spaniard"" bother drawing his fancy Spanish-cup hilt rapier on Blackbeard yet the two didn't duel. Then there was the unforgivable crippling of Barbossa, who was a total overall combat badass and is now just....meh. I still like the voice for him (Geoffrey Rush's doing yes?) and overall assertive demeanor. He is what I feel Sparrow should've been more like, cause Sparrow really didn't have too many ""Time to kick ass."" moments in all 4 films so far, beyond any 1v1 duels he fought, and that was botched when he dueled Jones. Half the time, brave and dealing damage, other half running all scared. Or maybe Jones just disgusted him cause of the tentacles?So I'm hoping against hope POTC 5 or (possibly) POTC 6 will have some titantic sea battle. Seriously sea battle/naval warfare movies need to get a dedicated sub-genre. Also, can someone PLEASE utilize a Ship of the Line (3rd rate-1st rate) a.k.a. Man O War like they know anything about naval history. Please, I had hopes the Endeavour would do more than just be a HMS Victory look-a-like then get shredded by a modified race-built galleon and modified dutch fluyt (flyut?). I'm not saying make another maelstrom but if that is an option, put something the size of the Endeavour in it with some evil looking warship hybrid of Flying Dutchman and Queen Annes Revenge.

2016-10-08T04:09:16,"Okay I watched the Trailer. Um, I honestly don't know wth is going on. If that was Will and Elizabeths son, shouldn't he look more.....pirate-y? I mean she was King of Brethren Court, Will captain of the Dutchman and both looked quite beautifully pirate-y to the nines. Now then, obviously a Royal Navy warship just got its butt handed to it in a ghost related boarding action (HMS Dauntless crap again) but now the ships appear to be full CGI instead of prop ships or even barge ships. Points are being deducted as I speak, CGI I can tolerate for ships that don't exist, but how hard is it to build a fully rigged (mostly) ship of 16th-18th century? I would think there would be a lot of structural or even size build corners to cut since a film doesn't need to build real warships but CGI is wasted on earthly warships. sci-fi no, historical warships, yes. And the ships I seen at the start, those are not stern designs I've ever seen on any warship. Closest might be Royal Sovereign or any French ship of the line around the same period as RS, which typically had heavily gilded and beautifully decorated sterns with over-sized lanterns.These ghosts look more like ghosts (compared to the moon ghosts of Curse of the Black Pearl) but this CGI seems awefully similar to the Ghostbusters reboot. Seriously, are there motion capture suits? I'd assume yes but *shrugs*At World's End, despite a lot of criticism really has set a few notable milestones in the pirate film genre, especially for modern times. However it does lack the grit a lot of much older films (Errol Flynn off the top of my head) and naval combat seems very half-done. Yes most of us know how all the cannons and such worked but I just wish a bit of that Master And Commander detail/audio would be used somehow. I want cannons to scare me, not sound like noises I could make with my own cheeks expelling air. Cept the Dutchman, her cannons always sounded more real, hell they even looked more period correct. I kind of wish the Royal Navy was left out of POTC cause nothing they do, say, etc is all that accurate.

2016-10-08T13:00:30,"Lame. These movies aren't anywhere near brutal enough for something with as much potential for it as Pirates, and all the supernatural elements are often so cheesy and weak. Try cutting out the comedy and giving a new protagonist. Jack Sparrow wasn't bad for originality, but they should just let that character go and start fresh. Take a leaf out of the real Blackbeard's book and have a hardcore, ruthless, intelligent, unpretty (yet visually impressive) and charismatic main character whose only humor is black as hell, and who terrifies anyone who hears his name. Make him a brutal fighter who takes to battle with beserver fury and loves nothing more. Make his crew equal parts fear and admiration but wholly loyal, because one of his good qualities is that he is a captain who pays well for their work, and they know their likely-short lives are going to be incredibly memorable. Let him play with people who underestimate him, and let him eventually get killed in an amazing final fight after undermining his enemies so many times before. Most of all, write him in a such a way that the audience is rooting for him throughout, even though they still haven't figured out who he truly is by the time he goes down in his blaze of glory.

Salazar and Almindez were given orders by Cortez after he went to Honduras: Salazar and Almindez become the two members of the three council members,  the second, replace Estrada and Albornoz. Estrada (Head Councilor) and Albornoz (Treasurer) both appointed by Spain's monarchy. Salazar and Almindez were going to depose them to control New Spain for themselves. The Coup didn't work, original members of the council told Cortez, he wasn't accepting betrayal and went after the council.

If anyone from the production is reading this, i know it may be hard work or expensive, but it makes so much sense if you have his whole body have the same phantom effect rather than just the top half. Also the footsteps seemed almost too real for this kind of ghoulish, other worldly character. I think it would be better if the feet didn't make so much of an impact with every step.
