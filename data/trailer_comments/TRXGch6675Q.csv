Then when some attractive guy finally comes along (who has probably had many of girlfriends, and possibly too much sexual intercourse therein) she becomes dumbfounded. And since she begins to have all these new *feelings* and he begins to influence her into something she has never been and things she has never done, she then begins to think that this is *the one*. And so with the intimate heat getting higher and the love making becoming more relentless she then turns into a hypersexual crazed addict, thus acting and behaving like a nymphomaniac. And even though all this time to him this may seem like just another girl he has hooked up with, she on the other hand sees this relationship as one that is meant to last. Then when something happens to him she is a complete wreck, even though the *feelings* she had were never mutual. Just my synopsis of this movie. Hahaha.

2014-02-20T06:07:19,  The original movie of ENDLESS LOVE captivated millions of viewers around the world. The original movie did focus on the passion and intense love of JADE (BROOKE SHIELDS and DAVID (MARTIN HEWITT). the novel is an account of DAVID'S love for JADE. The movie also included the arson that david did and was sent to MENTAL FACILITY instead of jail. He was released but he did see the family and Jade which he should not done as he was in probation. Jades father got hit by a car. not DAVIDS FAULT. so he was sent back to the mental facility. few years after. Jade went to visit him as it is ENDLESS LOVE for both of them- just as Jades mother told her she deserve anything. so Jade followed her heart against all odds. Great movie in 1981. the remake did not follow the story but used JADE and DAVID character the rest was not in the novel and the 1981 movie.

The original 1981 movie at least tried to stick with the original premise, so see that instead.  This seems awful, just from the trailer.  Girls, if you want a great romance movie, go back in time to movies made years ago...the ones they are making today aren't that great.  Try Romeo and Juliet from 1968.....for a start.",0,0,pookyfaust40,TRXGch6675Q,0.1984375,2014-03-27 01:34:24,False,True
