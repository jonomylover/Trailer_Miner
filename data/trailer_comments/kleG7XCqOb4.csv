If I only had a time machine, fuck Hitler, I would kill John Hughes.

As laymen, I know you feel puzzled as to how a movie can be worse than what you could write if you drank too much, ate a bunch of alphabet soup and vomited on a bunch of blank script pages. It's not much of a mystery if you consider two factors. First, the Hollywood elite, including Chevy Chase and the rest of the cast and crew that have a stake in the originals, are morally corrupt. To them, kids swearing and raunchy comedy IS FUNNY. Second, the filmmakers KNEW THE FILM WAS HORRIBLE. THEY DIDN'T CARE. Bad, cheesy movies sadly have a target market, and are much cheaper to make. Chevy Chase and the rest of the people that own stake in the film rights wanted a quick buck and knew they could spit out a film of bad quality that would find success because it was riding on the fame of the originals. They just wanted money. The sad part is this, the filmmakers spit on you as an audience. They knew you would expect it to be a quality film, knew they would get your bucks, and didn't care as they cut corners and pumped out easy to film crap so as to maximize their profits.",0,0,Spencer Woodhouse,kleG7XCqOb4,-0.1443333333333333,2015-11-05 10:41:53,False,False

2015-11-22T05:00:20,"I'm not a professional movie critic, but this movie wasn't that great. It wasn't painful to watch, but there were some problems with it even to the untrained eye. For one thing, the whole movie was just a bunch of travel tropes thrown together in a blender that you can see coming from ten miles away, such as the mysterious trucker who they think is trying to kill them but who in fact end up helping them and also the car running out of gas and then exploding when he hits the wrong button to try to access the auxiliary fuel tank which was obviously going to happen when they first introduce the foreign rented car and they don't even know what all of the buttons do in the first place. Then there's the part where, in an homage to the scene in the original where the dad drives off of the road because he was distracted by the pretty girl but the girl gets beaned by a truck going the other way instead of that happening, which I guess is a joke about how the other would be going the other way in real life. The crash only lasts a split second and the father looks out of the window in momentary concern and sees a smoking wreckage before he sighs and just continues driving on which makes this kind of a ""fat-lipped alligator moment"". You don't see what happened to her, not even during the credits where you see photographs that show the epilogues of what happened to some characters who appeared in the movie. No one got sick after the scene where they swim in the raw sewage drain because this stranger told them that it was the hot spring just so that he could rob their car. I'm glad that no one got sick, but it still raises the question of why they would have a raw sewage pit right next to a hot spring. The kayaking scene was predictable almost to the point of clairvoyance. You knew from the moment when the tour guide got off the phone with his wife divorcing him that he was going to try go off the mandatory waterfall along with everyone else in the raft. Not only that, but it happens right in front of the family instead of having it happen somewhere like when the family was first parking their car and they still decide to get in a raft with an obviously emotionally unstable person. At one point, their car flips over and lands on its wheels and they just keep driving again. Another predictable joke was when the obnoxious family cuts in front of them on the roller coaster line and you could tell they were going to get into a huge brawl. I thought that they were going to do something like have Wally World closed down or the workers on strike, but they probably would've known about it right away in the age of the internet. The part where the son says that he's never heard of the first vacation and the father says that this vacation can stand alone was kind of funny and self-deprecating.",0,2,Franklin Falco,kleG7XCqOb4,0.05201110259249793,2015-11-22 05:00:20,False,False
