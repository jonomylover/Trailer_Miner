I never comment/reply on anything, because it's work and I don't see any  money. I do this every other year, for events that I care deeply about? Maybe once a year.   OK!... This, in my opinion, is a game changer! I see where it's going and never could imagine such a task.. truly will happen!? (But Scarlett as major! She's not Japanese white!) Oh boo hoo! Cut it out, beaching about it, well, it's just creating something that ain't there. Us, you, me and gee ga may never understand! Until you’re expired. Chill out color washers…. Idiot.   Oh, so… This is a true team of genius. I wish you all the least amount of takes and true lucky 13’s to all. 13 works for me!    Maybe here in the states we think we know. Not until events like this come into our lives and open our minds. We all may… Possibly… all go out and see it the first day. Then after the credits wherever you, I, myself and Mr. Gong may be at any given moment… and right there, whatever weather you're having… country issues….color..you're in, well I believe we're going to see life alive, again, for the first time, again? Eh, sounds deep. You all get it. That's how passionate and talented this team is.   In closing,   Brandon Thompson, thank you for  introducing Ghost in the Shell also…. Cowboy Bebop! Life was always sweeter after I sat down and actually watched these shows.    You guys are amazing, YES Scarlett your amazing, blah, blah, hot whatever, we know. It's the other talent by her side that will make this vision real.    It’s so difficult to keep the die hard fans happy. I see the future, you're gonna make them all cry. Oh, I'm one, yup I am.   Congrats team, I will not torrent until after I see this 15 times in theaters!    Those of you who are unfamiliar, do your homework and watch the cartoons, don't like anime?

I feel like the antagonist is well written and well portrayed (at the moment); mainly because the way he said ""they stole it"" tells me a decent bit about the direction of the character. That Kabuki robot is also really fucking solid.The cons though is that the world still looks over done. They have huge holo billboards that cover tons of the city. which sucks cus in the animation its futuristic architecture but still gorgeous and actually a bit industial which adds alot of character to the world, compared to regular city with giant moving holo people. Scarlett Johansson portrayal is what i expected though. From the first screenshot she looked a bit weak and scared. ow with more lines and more to see she still seems that way. It seems as she was going for robotic rather than stoic Which is what Motoko is. Also that white outfit kinda sucks. IT was most likely a way to keep SJW from going crazy on them which i get but at the same time i feel like its so plain and adds nothing to the character. Motoko has style shes a bad ass and she always looks cool. As a matter of fact all of the outfits i saw looked bad on Johansson. Im not gunna get too into the directing but let me just say in a two minute trailer they did slo-mo 6 times and thats not a good thing. It just tells me they cared about the flashy effects more than the actual action which blows since its an action film.

The main character on the Ghost in the Shell anime actually looks more like Scarlett Johansson than any Asian woman I've seen. It is not like in something like Exodus: Gods and Kings or Gods of Egypt. And I am not an anime fan or anything, but a lot of the anime characters look nothing like people we consider Asian.

2016-11-14T14:36:54,"I'm trying to figure out witch plot they are basing this off of. I saw a lot of scenes straight from the 1st movie, 2 scenes straight from the 2nd movie, and plot points in the dialogue that sounded like they came from the 2nd season as well as a few that looked like they just came up with them completely on their own.  Now, the 1st movie had just about no plot. It was pretty much just an excuse for some beautiful visuals and some fan service. The 1st season had a wonderful plot and was the best story writing of the entire series. It does not look from this trailer like they are using any of that though. The 2nd season went a lot into the back-story of a lot of the characters.  So, here is my theory based on this trailer. I think that they are probably taking a lot of scenes directly from the 1st movie because it was such good visuals, but using a plot more similar to the 2nd movie witch actually had a freaking plot unlike the 1st. Meanwhile, they use the actual back-story from the 2nd season and come up with their own villain plot to fit in to it. Overall, I would say this concept definitely has potential. Enough to please the fans, but also give their writers creative license to come up with something interesting.

Disney/Marvel for whatever reason refuses to give her the 'Black Widow' film that fans are demanding so she has gone out and found a subject that is probably far better than what Black Widow will ever hope to be. I understand! I am sure she worked very hard and will earn millions for her job.  In fact, ScarJo has been one of my favorite indy actresses ever since Ghost World and Lost in Translation with Bill Murray (which is my favorite film of all time!).  However, I must protest this film and here's why:  Major Motoko Kusanagi: Japan name. Japanese character. Japanese manga. Japanese anime.  Caucasian actress.  Racist Hollywood whitewashing. Plain and simple, I'm afraid. Just as I have  refused to support Dr. Strange because Disney/Marvel whitewashed 'The Ancient One' which has been an Asian character since the 1960s, I cannot in good conscience support the whitewashed adaptation of Ghost in the Shell.  You know if blacks were used, Hollywood would never dare think to whitewash them. However, when the issue involves Asians, it seems Hollywood is given a free pass to whitewash and cast whites instead. That is not right. Its racism.  I only wish Scarlett Johansson would come out and publicly acknowlege this and start some kind of dialogue to stop the evil practice of whitewashing in Hollywood.  Boycott this film.  It is the only way to make Hollywood understand as there will be financial repercussions for whitewashing ethnic characters.",0,0,MICHAEL MAH,vctm5VD7qKQ,0.05865079365079365,2016-11-14 19:49:34,True,True

As for the Johansson controversy, for me, it's not about fidelity to the source (I don't expect much from Hollywood) as much as it's about equity for non-white actors; if white actors take all the non-white roles, what's left for everyone else? And, yes, I understand the financial motivation to cast big name stars but, seriously, these are Japanese characters with Japanese names in a Japanese anime set in Japan and yet I see one Japanese name in the cast listed above.

Although not sure about his physical condition, he is 66 years now. But there is another risk. We think that Ron could easily beat Scarjo. So we would have a movie where the main character is Batou. As Ishikawa We would choose Benicio Del Toro. Takeshi as Aramaki is the perfect choice. We agree with that. As for the Scarjo, until recently, We was not sure about this decision. Then We rewatched trailer several times and came to conclusion that maybe it's not the worst choice at all. But after Tokyo Event, it became clear that she have no idea what GITS is, before taking scenario. There is some concerns that she may refer filming in gits like another superhero movie about Avengers. In this case, it is fundamentally wrong attitude. Major is PRO but she is not a superhero, and more than vulnerable. As for Mr. Sanders we can only take on trust his words that he is a longtime fan of GITS. Finally we have a special recommendations to Mr. Sanders and Dreamworks! We highly recommend that the OST to the final credits were as follows : : 1. enjoy the silence(btw its great cover!), 2. lithium flower from SAC credits with original screenshots (that gives +100 to karma from fans) and maybe Origa after.
