Not discrediting the heroic actions of the people involved, but essentially the guys rushed someone with a box cutter; the rifle jammed and the pistol was only used on the first guy, so in all it sounds like one shot was fired.

The only movie I've seen from clint eastwood is Gran Torino and that movie was hot garbage. This looks boring too.   blah blah blah im so great im so important im so inspiring. Self-importance seems to be a theme in clint eastwood's movie. Gran Torino too he's like ""the savior"" of the weak and defenseless asain people. give me a break.. kinda what happens when you play so many heroic roles I guess. I respect him as an actor but not as a director  also, who gives a shit if the actors are the actual people? The point of movies (unless in document/actual footage types) is that it's all make believe to sell a message. It honestly doesn't matter at all and in fact, it makes it even weirder cus then it's like ""oh yeah im so great. I'll star in the movie that reminds people im so great"" imagine someone made a movie about how great trump is and they star trump himself. regardless of your political view, that would look so cocky. Like burns staring as burns in his own movie to glorify himself.   Another thing is the performance might suffer. Take Gran Torino for example. The hmong people or whatever werent even actors and this one kid's acting was so shit it took me out of the movie. There's a dramatic scene where clint locks up this kid and the kid screams clint's name while banging the door. Go look it up. it's hilariously bad. That hmong blood sure helped the movie! Honestly, no one gives a shit if he's actually hmong or if a peson like walt actually existed. If ""they starred real people"" is what gets your movie remembered, then it's a bad movie.  I get it you people love clint eastwood. I like him too. just not the movie he directs  Also, what the fuck. i hate these movies where you already know this one major scene is coming up and the entire fucking movie is in an anticipation of that one scene. what's the point.   I already know what the movie wants to say. i know what it's about. so by the end of the movie i wouldn't have learned anything new than how great this guy is. So boring. I watch documentaries for that and they're much more honest about what happened and cut the bullshit about melodramatic scenes in their life.

2018-02-03T02:54:08,"As Hollywood Tries to Stop New Patriotic Movie, Clint Eastwood Gives Them Brutal Surprise         Clint Eastwood‚Äôs new movie, ‚ÄúThe 15:17 to Paris,‚Äù is based on true events, where three American heroes stopped a terrorist on a Paris train in 2015, and it is causing the Hollywood crowd to go nuts.  They just tried to put the kibosh on certain scenes that didn‚Äôt fit their liberal agenda, and boy, that made Eastwood mad.  So, the famous actor and director who voted for President Donald Trump just slapped the leftists hard with a brutal surprise.  You‚Äôre going to love it.     Clint Eastwood is an American icon and is probably the most famous conservative actor and director in Hollywood.  Eastwood‚Äôs legendary work affords him the ability to pick and chose what type of movies he‚Äôll make, and he loves making patriotic American movies.     His current film, ‚ÄúThe 15:17 to Paris,‚Äù is in the final edits, but the Hollywood crowd hates it, and they tried to stop certain people from seeing it.  The reason is the pro-American message it sends, described in this synopsis on Google:  ‚ÄúIn the early evening of August 21, 2015, the world watched in stunned silence as the media reported a thwarted terrorist attack on Thalys train #9364 bound for Paris‚Äîan attempt prevented by three courageous young Americans traveling through Europe.‚Äù     The summary adds, ‚ÄúThroughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.  The heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film.‚Äù     The movie stirs real patriotic emotion and honors the three American heroes who have military backgrounds.  It shows an Islamic terrorist, who gains entry into France as a migrant, attempting to slaughter 500 people, with three Americans stopping him.  This just isn‚Äôt the type of movie the Hollywood crowd makes, and they tried to screw Eastwood by giving it an ‚ÄúR‚Äù rating.     The reason they gave for the ‚ÄúR‚Äù rating was it showed ‚Äúviolence,‚Äù and this pissed off Clint Eastwood, who is making this film so teens could also see a movie with real American values.  It was a cheap shot by the liberal Hollywood idiots, and Eastwood decided that wasn‚Äôt going to happen.  The legendary star shocked the Hollywood crowd by taking on the rating board himself, something that never happens.  And, not only did he take them on, he blew them away.     ‚ÄúClint Eastwood has won an appeal to overturn the R rating originally assigned to his upcoming film, The 15:17 to Paris.  Instead, it will be rated PG-13.  According to a source, the R rating was given for the train attack scene at the center of the film, which the Classification and Rating Administration described as ‚Äòa sequence of violence and bloody images,‚Äô‚Äù reported Hollywood Reporter.     They added, ‚ÄúThe Classification and Rating Appeals Board says it reviews 800 to 900 films each year, with fewer than 12 ratings a year appealed.  Eastwood represented his own film on behalf of Warner Bros., which opens the film in theaters on Feb. 9.‚Äù     Clint doesn‚Äôt just play a ‚Äútough guy‚Äù in his movies, he showed those Hollywood snakes that he really is a tough guy who won‚Äôt be pushed around.  He‚Äôll make any darn movie he wants to make, and they won‚Äôt stop him from making sure as many Americans as possible can see it.     Here‚Äôs the highly awaited trailer for ‚ÄúThe 15:17 to Paris‚Äù that just came out:       click here:   https://www.youtube.co m/watch?v=IC_lnyn2R2Q     In case you‚Äôre wondering how much the Hollywood crowd detests this movie for its pro-American military theme along with its anti-Islam, anti-migrant message, here‚Äôs how one Hollywood critic describes it:     But in the hands of someone like Eastwood, this [movie] reads like a recruitment ad for the military.  Nothing diminishes the heroism of these three men, but in Eastwood‚Äôs hands, it looks like he‚Äôs coasting on their achievements to tell a story that will make some people think that they too can be heroes if they just head down to their local recruitment office.  [Source: Collider]     Well, let the haters hate.  They loathe patriotism and they despise middle-class working Americans who love this country.  They can‚Äôt stand Clint Eastwood who said that former President Barack Obama is ‚Äúthe greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.‚Äù     Lastly, what in the hell is wrong with sending the message to teens that they too can be heroes?  What is wrong with giving some kids the idea that joining the military is a heroic thing to do?  This is exactly the kind of movie our young people need to see in today‚Äôs world that is filled with idiot celebrities pushing anti-American messages.  If this movie inspires just one young American to join the military and make their life worthwhile, then Clint Eastwood‚Äôs film will be a resounding success.     http://us-daily.tk/hollywood-t ries-stop-new-patriotic-movie- clint-eastwood-gives-brutal- surprise",1,0,Steffie,IC_lnyn2R2Q,0.09008748196248201,2018-02-03 02:54:08,False,True

It actually takes away from the story of these men, turns them into action heroes rather than ordinary people tasked with doing extraordinary things. Someone should have pulled the plug.

F√ºr dessen Motive oder dessen Hintergrund interessiert sich der Film allzu demonstrativ nicht. Nein, Eastwood kommt es auf die ungebrochen-m√§nnliche Haltung seiner drei Haupthelden an, die offenbar das Schicksal und eine entsprechende uramerikanische Erziehung hierher gebracht haben. Was zun√§chst einfach ein unoriginelles Drehbuch zu sein schien, bekommt einen unangenehm didaktischen Unterton: Wenn man Jungs nur fr√ºh genug mit Waffen spielen l√§sst und nicht auf Lehrerinnen eingeht, die mehr Konzentration im Unterricht fordern (was der Film mit Medikamentierung gegen ADS gleichsetzt), dann zieht man wahre Helden heran.‚Äú",0,0,L B,IC_lnyn2R2Q,0.0,2018-04-17 06:52:45,False,True
