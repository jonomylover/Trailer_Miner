2017-01-03T03:52:20,"The Lord said, ‚ÄúThis is the blood of many, My daughter, who have died without Me, as well as the blood of the innocent people Satan has killed.‚Äù After seeing this stream of blood, I understood why I saw blood flowing in hell at times. The Jesus said, ‚ÄúLook over there.‚Äù I looked, and there was a room with gold walls, such as a king would have, which was wide open in the front; it seemed to be about half a mile long. There was also a gold ceiling with chandeliers. Everything looked so immaculate and beautiful. And then I saw a throne‚Äî and there sat Satan! He was facing the blood that was flowing down. I can‚Äôt really describe it as a waterfall, but it was full of blood, all blood. And Satan was laughing about it. On either side of the throne was a large demon. One of the demons was standing next to the devil, holding a scroll. He was perhaps thirteen feet high and very round, with three heads, a hairy body, six arms, and about six legs. He looked as if he weighed two thousand pounds. Opening up the scroll, he held it to the devil‚Äôs face, saying, ‚ÄúO King, we will win against God. The list has increased of those who have lost their souls.‚Äù The devil was very large, as well. He had a big face and huge horns; his countenance was like the face of a man, although part of his head was crushed. He had a wide chest, about four feet across, and huge, muscular arms. He also had very large, muscular legs. And he had webbed feet and claws. Sometimes his body appeared to be red, and sometimes it appeared to be brown. As he sat there, he turned into a good-looking man wearing a suit. Satan stood up and said, ‚ÄúI know the secrets, because I was in heaven. I know what temptations to send a man through women and other lusts of the flesh to destroy him. I know that my voice has not yet been destroyed, but if my force of evil was ever shut down, I would not be able to seduce so many people. And I am letting all you demons hear this and know this.‚Äù Standing in an area in this valley were what seemed like a million demons. Satan turned to them and said, ‚ÄúIt is your job never to allow this revelation of my strength and my courage and my power to be revealed to the prophets or the apostles or the people; for there truly is a judgment on me, and I will be thrown in the lake of fire one day because God has said so. But I‚Äôve taken the wisdom I learned in heaven and the wisdom I‚Äôve learned of man as my own wisdom and knowledge, and I‚Äôve seduced thousands and thousands into hell through the lust of their flesh, which they desired more than God‚Äôs commands; and the bloodfall there is a result of my wisdom.‚Äù I trembled and said, ‚ÄúOh, God, how can this be?‚Äù Jesus looked at me and said, ‚ÄúListen, child.‚Äù I watched and listened again as Satan sat back down on the throne and returned to his original appearance. He laughed and said, ‚ÄúI have the power to change my form anytime I want, and I have given that power to some of my demons that are going to be roaming the earth. I have many plans of evil. I will seduce many people so that they will not follow Jesus Christ.‚Äù Baxter, Mary K.. A Divine Revelation of Satan‚Äôs Deceptions (Kindle Location 451). Whitaker House. Kindle Edition.
