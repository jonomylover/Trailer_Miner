Its just another Transformer movies.¬†  Universal please, just understand that sometimes,the most greatest villain can be the death itself And the best way to portray it its just showing the hope of living.

You're trying to use voice overs from other parts of the movie that are overlayed over the cut scenes in the trailer to somehow tie scenes together to narrate the trailer and make what happens in it and what is said on those voice overs into the actual movie. Morons.  2. The I-Rex is NOT communicating with other dinosaurs. The trained raptors are communicating with non-trained raptors. The, ""Somethings wrong, THEY'RE communicating."" part slipped past those 2 brain cells the 20 times you have watched it already. That much is obvious. THEY are in reference to the Raptors. NOT the I-Rex. Just because you see him in the next scene or a previous one means nothing. Thats from a different part of the movie.  And if you actually watch the trailer and, oh pay attention, you'll notice Raptors killing humans. Wait, how did that happen? Oh yeah. Because there are 2 sets of Raptor groups. The ones that help Star Lord himself...and another group of un-trained Raptors. Now go back to #2.  3. 2:00...witness the T-Rex from the first movie being set free to fight the I-Rex and the lady running like hell to get away. Who do you think the lady was releasing with the flair in the first trailer? http://www.jurassicworld.com/raptor-pass/claire/  4. Raptors...like oh...a good chunk of species on earth can be trained, and have been, to some extent by humans. Lions, Tigers, Elephants, Dogs, Alligators, etc....all have either been tamed or their natural instincts suppressed especially if raised from birth.  Wait, you still have a problem with the Raptors being trained a bit? Yet you don't have issue with the fact real Raptors were the size of chickens? Seek help.  5. The I-Rex wasn't talking with the Pterodactyls or any other creatures. It was scaring them to into flight so they would leave the chamber. It didn't gain some 'Force' level abilities for the people that are simple minded.  6. The Mosasaurus obviously does not discriminate against what it eats. hint hint for the people that still can't add.  7. If you honestly believe you saw the whole movie in this or the previous trailers...far from it. There are still multiple dinosaurs, people, and situations and events that you haven't seen and if you want more...check out the website. It's got a wealth of info. Seriously. Tons of hints, secrets and info if you pay attention and look.

I recently watched the original Jurassic Park on Blu Ray, and while the Brachiosaurus scene looked a little ropey by today's standards, the T-Rex looked as real in glorious HD as it did when I watched it in the cinema in 1993! It looked like a believable animal. Maybe its just me, but the dinosaurs done with current gen CGI just don't look real, they almost look *too detailed* to the point of being unnatural. The skin and muscle also seems to move too much, almost like it is made out of jelly and isn't attached to a skeleton.  Perhaps we have reached the 'uncanny valley' of dinosaur CGI?  Secondly, too many explosions. Seriously, this is the type of film that shouldn't need ANY explosions. The fantastic thing about the original was that all of the suspense, the horror and the adrenaline was produced without a single explosion, and only a couple of gunshots, which were only heard and weren't even shown on screen!  It was ALL the animals and the terror of being hunted.  They're freaking DINOSAURS for goodness sake!

2015-04-21T03:44:09,"Let me first say that I am 100% not one of those bandwagoning haters who likes to complain about things for the sake of it. Jurassic World is my #1 most anticipated movie this year and I have loved all the trailers but this new one brought me some concerns...  1) Lack of animatronics. There are two main scenes in the trailer where they could have easily used animatronics and puppets like in the first 3 films. One instance was in the raptor enclosure where Owen says ""stand down"" and the other is T-Rex goat feeding scene. Both of those were clearly all CGI and the only animatronic we have seen was a brief shot of a dying apatosaurus in one of the TV spots.  2) The raptors design. For one, they look fat compared to the raptors in the other films...I don't know why. And bringing up that scene in the raptor enclosure where Owen says ""stand down"", I can compare it to the scene in JP3 where they are giving back the eggs...only in JP3 they used animatronics and puppet suits for most of the raptor shots (I think only their legs were CGI) and it looked 100x better.  3) Ankylosaurus and pteranodon that gets eaten by the mosasaur look WAY too big, just like I thought the stegosaurus in TLW was. If you go on the Jurassic World website it says the ankylosaurus is 6 feet high, but compare that to the gyrosphere and the kids inside it...it looks about 10-12 feet high.  4) The dialogue at 1:13. Claire saying ""How would it know to do that"" not only is horrible line given the context of her character, but is also badly delivered IMO.",0,0,dinoatcharterdotnet,aJJrkyHas78,0.06646885521885525,2015-04-21 03:44:09,True,True

Judging by the trailer, this will be mindless action sequences involving shitty cgi with one sided characters with little dynamic.  The previous films, or at least the original, was not about dinosaurs as this movie seems to make it out to be.  It's about the follies of man when they try to replicate works of God.    There are way too many extras killed in this trailer alone as dino food to make me feel any connection to the lives that will be lost in the movie.   And as far as the emphasis on dinosaur intelligence goes...they're doing it wrong.  Just seems like they're trying too hard to be like ""heyyy look in this movie they're smarter than before"" followed by explosions and a bunch of people being eaten.    In conclusion- disappointed but going to wait till its online for free or go with a bunch of friends to see it as it should be treated as of yet- a fun, mindless transformers-like movie.

2015-04-21T07:20:09,"Think back on the first movie..... Jurassic Park. What made that movie so great? Why were the dinosaurs so magical? Think back to the way they acted and the way they were revealed. Think of the sick Triceratops and Ellie, or Dr. Grant and the first time the velociraptors are fed. Think of the tech used in the park, like the vehicles. We all understand how the current world works, how animals act, how people work and what tech is possible.¬†  Watching this trailer, I just cant take anything seriously. The way people are interacting with dinosaurs and the way the dinosaurs are acting around the people. Chris training the velociraptors looks like something out of the Flintstones. It looks so cartoony and unrealistic. In the first movie you were scared of the raptors, now they look like a joke. Can you really suspend your disbelief for a guy riding on a motorcycle leading a pack of dinosaurs? The circular vehicle, does that thing really look like something you would see in the real world?¬†  Point is this whole movie feels like its going to be a Frankenstein monster movie mixed with the Flintstones. Suspension of Disbelief is very important. Go watch Mr. Plinketts review of Star Wars Prequels and you can see where this movie is going quick.

Also, the CGI looks very well-done at this point. ¬†That shot of the Mosasaur leaping out of the water to attack the Pterodactyl looked phenomenal, and anyone who says otherwise can just stay the fook away from the theater when this comes out. ¬†The CGI in the original is shockingly bad, and anyone claiming it is ""better"" than what is in this trailer is not a real fan of the series. ¬†I watch the original movie at least once a month, and that first shot of the Brachiosaurus is absolutely terrible- not that it detracts from such an exceptional movie. ¬†The CGI is just a victim of the technology available in 1993. ¬†There is simply no feasible way to create actual life-size models of all the dinosaurs in this movie, and even if there was you couldn't use them in fast-paced action sequences anyway. ¬†That being said, I am 100% sure that the people involved in this movie spared no expense when it came to the CGI, and there WILL BE auto-erotic dinos too, so please STFU and either enjoy the new movie or just don't watch it.

2015-04-21T17:23:07,"Sadly, I'm kind of turned off by a lot of the stuff I saw in this preview. It just seems like another hokey Action/Hollywood blockbuster, with dinosaurs! All visuals, sub-par actors, crap plot, and too much CGI. I long for the days when a substantial amount of money was spent on stunts, pyrotechnics, animatronics and decent actors. Yes, we can all agree that that formula costs a lot of money, but there's no argument when talking about how tangibly real those types of movies feel. Don‚Äôt tell me you didn't walk out of the theater after watching the first film thinking that Jurassic Park wasn't a real theme park, with real dinosaurs, that actually existed. Because that movie was so masterfully done (despite the deviation from the book) you couldn't think of a reason to deny the possibility that, in fact, Jurassic Park was plausible. Also, for anyone who‚Äôs read the books, can we talk about the slew of discrepancies/inconsistencies that are plaguing this film? For starters, let‚Äôs talk about Hollywood‚Äôs blatant disregard to the fact that Bd Wong‚Äôs character gets eaten alive by raptors in the first book. Why does Hollywood just not give a fuck? Why?

2015-04-21T20:14:17,"As a Jurassic Park fan myself, I've been waiting a long time for this movie to come out, but definitely not as long as some others have. Honestly, the concept of this movie is great. Even if it doesn't seem great, look at it like this: it's a giant step up from the previous two movies. Both of them, particularly the third film, focused on repetitive and horrible reasons for the characters to return to Isla Sorna. In ""Jurassic World"", the characters are on Isla Nublar (the island from the first movie), where they are occupied/involved with the park in some way. To sum things up, this movie has a lot of potential that should not be wasted.  As a filmmaker/editor/trailer editor myself, I feel that this trailer could have certainly done a better job with setting the tone for the movie, particularly at the beginning. The first trailer did a great job with setting the tone of the movie by giving the park a more grandeur feel. Here, the park isn't really featured like that. The little joke at the beginning of the trailer actually took away from the quality of it in a way. The grandeur feel is what this trailer and the film itself should really aim for, along with featuring a modern, fully-functioning park that is spectacular and breathtaking.¬†  Nevertheless, I've still got my hopes up for this movie.

2015-04-21T23:56:18," like teaser trailers so much better than trailers. Teasers show one thing: the movies name and what it's gonna be about. If it's something new,than its okay to show something, but they litearly showed every exciting part of the film and ruined the plot. The park is doing well, this guy is freinds with the raptors, than BOOM  they decide it's a good idea to make a giant dinosaur with the strength of a T-rex, the intelligence  of a velociraptor, and the size of a gigantosaurus. It escapes, tears up the park, and just when our heroes to think they can defeat her, she starts communicating with other dinosaurs. The ending will inevitably either be 1; nuke the island and be happy until they are stupid enough to do it again, or 2; get that sea Dino to eat it, or 3; the dino whisperer convinces the raptors to fight with them and they team up on the I-Rex.

This movie seems to have a lot more action but they should at the very least do four scenes with practical dinos. Speaking of action, how come it's so hard to kill the freaking dinosaurs! It's a huge 8 ton animal more than 40 feet long and with all the guns and rockets they still have to resort to a guy with a bunch of raptors to kill it.

2015-04-22T01:47:38,"Ugh!!!! Ok, here's why this sucks... ""If we do this, we do this my way"". OMG NO PLEASE! Do we have to suffer through another dumb caveman, testosterone-drunken, testicle-dangling, stupid jock, kill-for-the-sake-of-killing, emotionless weapon-wielding, blood sport, overly-used CGI¬†movie? That's the mentality that destroyed¬†Avatar, ¬†Independence Day, the second Star Wars Trilogy, and anything with girly-man Ahnald Swarzaneggar. I wonder how many other¬†tragically mind numbing clich√©s Spielberg will torture us with, like¬†""I gotta get me one of these!"", ""Lock & Load!"", ""Show me the money!"", ""Is that all you got?!"", ""We can do this the easy way or the hard way!"", ""Don't die on me!"", ""You just don't get it, do you?!"", ""The press is gonna have a field day"", and the number one worse movie clich√© for which every director who uses it¬†should be slapped: ""Let's do this thing!"". I demand $1 million dollars from Universal for pain & suffering for each use of one of these ear-bleeding phrases used in this movie. Spielberg and Marshall have forgotten¬†their roots and betrayed the Craft. There's absolutely NOTHING wrong with CGI - the problem is with how the live action interacts with it. Even science fiction needs to have a level of believability. It doesn't matter how fantastic the graphics are,¬†there's no way I'm going to believe that some young douchebag jock (no matter how visually appealing he may be)¬†is going to be a Velociraptor Whisperer and take on Godzilla-sized carnivores that an armored and armed military couldn't take out! Gimme a fricking break!!! And there is not enough fear demonstrated by the actors when facing these terrifying beasts. When THEY aren't afraid, the viewer isn't afraid. There's no emotional connection to the characters.

The reason the t-rex is always star of the show isnt because its the biggest baddest dinosaur, its because its the most iconic dinosaur almost anyone can think of. Its like trying to replace Wolverine in the x-men with someone who is just a stronger wolverine... It just wouldnt work.  If anything they should be keeping the T-rex in the big-baddy role that it belongs in, and be replacing the raptors with more advanced breeds instead. Those are the dinos that are more popular for what they can do than simply what they are. I mean seriously..

She said I looked exactly like him! Well, wow, this really threw me for a loop. So I apologized, feeling really bad. Then she asked if she could call me, ""son?"" Well of course I said yes. And then she asked me if I would call her, ""Mom?"" Of course I agreed. It made me feel better. So we continued our shopping together, she told me her son died in a car crash and she asked about my life. We chatted until we got to the check out line. I let her go first. I didn't pay much attention after that and began to read a magazine. After she was finished she turned to me and said ""Bye son."" And I said ""Bye Mom."" And she got a big smile on her face.  So then I went through the check out and when finished, my total was almost double of what it should be. I told the clerk she made a mistake, my groceries couldn't be that much. The clerk told me that my mom said I would pay for her groceries! I screamed, ""What!"" I told her to wait and I quickly ran out into the parking lot. I saw the woman at the far end just finishing putting her groceries into a car. I ran as fast as could and caught her just as she was about to close her car door. I caught, pulled it and yelled at the lady demanding what she was doing. She started screaming and saying she didn't know me.

Initially, it didn't make sense to me, but now I have a pretty good theory about just what the line means.¬†  If you look at 2:07, you see a Velociraptor pounce on someone - a brief yet extremely unexpected twist considering the raptors are being trained by Owen. Ultimately, the Velociraptors are still the dangerous creatures they've been for the previous three films. They obviously work with Owen in some way, but it is shown that they do wind up turning on the humans at some point.¬†  Anyway, I was watching the trailer once more, and I came to a realization. The only real characters that can communicate with each other and have that ability surprise the other characters are, ultimately, the Velociraptors! In the previous films, particularly in the third, the Velociraptors were shown to be communicating with each other through various growls and snarls. My theory is that yes - Owen, Barry and the other protagonists will use the Velociraptors however they need to, but for whatever reason, whether they come to their senses or what, the Velociraptors turn on the humans and communicate with each other to devise some sort of new plan - possibly, and more than likely, one that involves lots of shredding, screeching, claws and teeth. So no, we definitely won't be seeing tamed Velociraptors for the entire film. At some point, I'm pretty sure that the audience will be thoroughly pleased.¬†  If you have another theory about the line, feel free to raise it.

And there's two of them. And one of them ATE the other one, possibly gaining all its superpowers and becoming twice the megapower because I don't know that's how science works maybe. So it tears down the park, with all the people still in it, communicating with all the other dinosaurs intelligently to blow the dome that's keeping them sealed.

The models are better, the bone and muscle riggings are better, the textures are better, the blending is better, and the animation is better. If you don't believe me go watch the original again! (fact) 3.)Practical effects were used in almost the entire dilophosaurus scene, about half the T-Rex sequence, about a quarter of the velociraptor sequences, and the mast majority of the brachiosaurus tree scene. The rest was CGI!! (fact) 4.)If you wanted all the dinosaurs in this movie to be practical effects that bad, you people should've started a Kickstarter to raise the $2 billion+ to make it a reality.

2015-04-24T20:13:51,"Once upon a time there was a theme park called Jurassic World. Everything seemed to be okay and under control until they made a ""new dinosaur"" because marketing managers felt like we are done with the T-Rex. So this thing was more out of control than they suspected, broke out of its cage, and started causing chaos. The whole, "" we have things under control"" ended up being bullshit because ONE dinosaur sort of fucked that all up, sound familiar? So they rely on this popular character that can tame Raptors by showing off his dance skills to "" Come and Get your Love"" ¬†Because lets face it, having a jew hyped up on sugar talking about "" Life will find a way"" is sort of just overrated now. We need NEW! but still the same thing... Like the other two characters that are kids....sound familiar? Oh and they scream for their lives while a dino hand is trying to break through some glass sphered vehicle... I wonder if they give themselves away by thinking a flashlight will scare the dinosaur away. ¬†So they probably get lost, wonder around the park while all this destruction is happening, and of course are probably there for the finale. All the while, Starlord.... I mean.... guy that has Malcolm's personality mixed with Muldoon's traits.... TRACKS down the BIG, SMART, KILLING MACHINE.... with his pet raptors. But here is probably were the twist lies..... The BIG, SMART, KILLING MACHINE can communicate with all the other dinosaurs... and he's basically telling them, "" HEY! we're in cages! We're being ruled by these humans. Lets kick their asses out! ANARCHY IN THE JP!""¬† Uh-oh....seems like we have a major problem here.

The first park was seen by very few people, all under nondisclosure agreements. After the rex in San Diego, word got out that people cloned dinosaurs. Tigers attack people all the time, but people still go to zoos. Same principle, but with something much more impressive. The third movie was again, a small group of people on an island that is a restricted area. I seriously doubt the world at large knew what happened in the third movie.  tl;dr version: The public didn't know about most JP events, but even if dinosaurs are dangerous people would pay to go see them, just like with regular zoos",2,0,Chewbaccafruit,aJJrkyHas78,0.02806349206349207,2015-04-25 05:29:31,True,True

2015-04-25T11:51:04,"It's completely understandable that some people think that the CGI of this movie is not that great, given a great masterpiece to compare with nearly 25 years ago, this is inevitable. But there are absolute idiots who think it's because of the use of CGI itself as opposed to Animatronics. Learn a thing or two,¬† 1. ONLY the close-up shots and some of the raptors were Animatronics, the rest and the establishing shots of the movie that you all 'remember' were CGI in the original movie itself. 2. Why did they use animatronics then at all? Because technology wasn't great enough to produce highly detailed CGI with all the scales and stuff that would look decent in CGI, so they were FORCED to use animatronics. Animatronics were never a better option. 3. Animatronics can NEVER replicate a 'living' thing, because it's not just about sculpting a realistic model, it's about giving it 'life'. These animals have skin, which move over muscles, which change shape with the movement of the bones. To produce atleast a 10% similar effect in a life-scale animatronic would require so much energy to actually make it move and work. 4. FINALLY, watch some of those 720p videos of the gallimimus scene, dinosaur hunting scene in lost world, then you'll know how simplistic the models/textures of the dinosaurs were. They were 'great' for their time, but not AS AMAZING as you claim it to be. No they're not timeless, they fail in today's standards, you'll know the difference if that CGI was rendered in 1080p. With the resolution of photography becoming larger and larger, the CGI work demands more and more intricacies and detail.¬†  Maybe they are not where they should be right now in terms of development, but they have progressed MUCH more than your simple eyes can appreciate. Know some details, understand how things work and then talk.  I'm disappointed that they used any Animatronics at all, thanks to all you butt hurt fan boys. The close up shots of those sauropod that they revealed in the Super bowl trailer in 1080p was cringe-worthy. (I acknowledge that the Animatronics in the older movies were better) But I'm glad they used it for a dying animal, because that's all the life an animatronic of this size can have.",2,0,Pradeep Christopher,aJJrkyHas78,0.16694862155388474,2015-04-25 11:51:04,True,True

I mean watching this is almost no different than staying at home playing your Xbox video game on your big TV.

So I'm kind of null on the cgi points  The story looks kind of dull. The heroine is basically robotic, star lord seems like kind of a stereo type, and the kids I honestly don't even care what happens to them. The rest of the cast seems alright though. To be fair there was only about 3 characters I cared about in the first movie too so who knows. ¬†Still this whole she's super smart thing seems a little over played. I mean they have guns and all are we to believe they're worthless vs such a creature? Or maybe these guys got their training from the same place the star wars storm troopers did who knows. She can communicate with the other dinos and work together with them? She's killing other creatures just for the sake of killing other creatures? I don't know these parts of the preview just strike me as something a forum fan boy would write for their fiction blog.

This trailer basically is just 80% of the movie, shortened down to 2 minutes. I cannot see their reasons for releasing this one, when the last trailer was so good. Now look at the Star Wars trailers in comparison. A bunch of interesting scenes, a brief look at our new characters, but basically not a single plot point given away in the trailer. I can go into that movie theater without much idea of what i am getting. With this Jurassic World trailer tho, i feel like i have already seen the movie. If i go see this film in theaters, it will just be a longer repeat of this trailer.Eighter that, or they completely pull the rug out under me, and everything in this trailer was a deliberate decoy (wich would be frikkin' amazing), althought i highly doubt they will have the creativity nor the guts to do so.",0,0,Jon Johansen,aJJrkyHas78,0.08283148949815616,2015-05-16 00:02:25,True,True

2015-06-12T10:36:03,"I saw this yesterday. And here's my *SPOILER FREE* review of it:  It is definitely the best JP sequel but definitely not better than the first. There are many moments throughout the movie that will make you roll your eyes. My biggest gripe was the fact people, especially the kids, were all chirpy and happy and cracking jokes just after they had been smashed around in the GyroSphere and witnessed a guy being torn apart by a raptor. The film seems a lot more lighthearted than the first in that sense. In the first film, when the raptors started ripping shit up, there wasn't any ""don't tell your mother about this!"" or ""your boyfriends a bad ass :D "". I wasn't too keen on the whole ""dinosaurs communicating"" thing either.   I am also one of those people who complained about the lack of animatronics, but after seeing the film, I can honestly say the CGI is amazing through most of the movie.  There's only a few scenes where it was a bit ""off"" in my opinion, such as the dinosaurs around the GyroSphere (especially a triceratops that gets up) and some of the raptors in their paddock. The I-Rex looks stunning throughout.  The ending (and I won't spoil it) will actually blow you away. It almost brought me to tears (don't laugh) as a huge fan of the original. There are lots of set pieces from the original in this film. There's lots of references to past characters too. Even parts of the original soundtrack are used.   The film is a rollercoaster of emotions. There's dark, scary and jumpy moments. There's lots of ""wow, that's amazing"" moments. There's lots of nostalgic ""OMFG that's from the first film"" moments. And there's even a few sad, tear jerking moments.

After getting their finance ballanced, they started the Jurrasic World again. But, this time the dinosaurs had became wild because it have been closed down for more than 50 years. That explain why their technology is so great. So they sign another treaty to the Illuminati, this is when they paid mountain dew. Now, they have the power to control dinosaurs. But, the dinosaurs mind is so strong, it took over the humans gaining their knowledge. Now t-rex are omnivores and adapt to the enviroment. Adaption stop until they found their new robot arms.

Some CGI scenes (as with many movies I see nowadays) seem weightless and lacking inertia. It's unconvincing. It looks like most of the focus went to the last dinosaur fight scene. Also, whenever the dinosaurs were stroked or touched, their skins seemed to lack any sort of elasticity whatsoever. The little kid in the story was obnoxious at best throughout the movie. His whiny scenes literally made me laugh out loud. This movie was all about action and visual effects. It accomplished about 4/5ths of it. The depth and amazement just wasn't there for me. No real awe factor. Of course, a lot of other loop holes in the story with dumbest decisions ever made that would fail any being's logic test... What sort of engineer/security system not double check sources to be firm about the whereabouts of a dinosaur? It's almost as if the movie producers/writers did not want to consider rationale or real world human decisions and opted for sensation, which is fine, but dumbs down the movie to all but a money making machine rather than a story that would withstand the test of time like Jurassic Park.",0,0,kirokyo,aJJrkyHas78,0.08689613526570049,2015-06-26 19:45:05,False,True

These were thrilling, had a pretty realistic story and were extremely entertaining to watch.  This movie howsoever was fullfilled with actions that didn't make any sense. Dinosaurs are beasts, they kill and don't have sympathies for anything. They don't think, they kill. They don't ally with others, they kill. They won't fight at your side, they kill. But not in this movie. The protagonist is trying to command them, so he can use them for fights or whatever, can't remember. Then ofc things get worse because that super T-Rex is so smart that he can remove that implant from his body... are you kidding me? And all these senseless things are just the beginning: -> there are no, and I mean no tanks, helicopters or towers to defend the people in a worst case szenario. Are you kidding me? -> the super T-Rex destroyed the gate from his cell when it was opened for like 20 cm. When he can break that with ease he could just run through all the walls with ease as well. -> after the super T-Rex escaped the people weren't evacuated or warned to save their lifes. This is just total bullshit. -> the super T-Rex goes crazy and ofc the ""normal"" T-Rex fights against it and not the people, that he originally killed in the movies of the series -> and THAT was the worst of this crappy movie: a random creature jumps out of the water and kills that super T-Rex at the same place where PEOPLE were watching that water show at the beginning of the movie.  But as it seems the vast majority is satisfied to see senseless movies, as long as they have a lot of action and realistic ""cool"" looking effects.

2018-07-01T00:55:37,"All hell broke loose in the park...again. Even though Sam Neill, Laura Dern or Jeff Goldblum didn't reprise their roles for Jurassic World, it was still an entertaining film. If Sam Neill was asked to reprise his role of Dr. Alan Grant and had accepted the offer, his character probably would've revisited the island of Isla Nublar and he probably would've told Claire Dearing (who was the park's operation's mananger) and Simon Masrani (who was the CEO of the Masrani Corporation and owner of Jurassic World) that they have no idea what they have done when they had brought a lot of innocent people to the island and had the Indominus Rex created and if he had seen how Owen Grady trains velociraptors, he probably would've told Owen that he has no idea what animals like that are capable of. Anyway, ever since I had first seen the fourth film, I had often wondered why they didn't still call the title of it ""Jurassic Park"" with a sub-title added to describe the film's story just like they did to the title of the 6th film (Fallen Kingdom). And speaking of which, I came across either early production or fan-made artwork of the Jurassic World gate and if you look closely, you can see that the gate sign says ""Jurassic Park"" http://jurassicoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/JurassicWorld_Gates.jpg",0,0,JDMod789,aJJrkyHas78,0.21043956043956044,2018-07-01 00:55:37,False,False
