2016-10-28T09:29:03,"""Not enough white people in this""... it's bad enough that we don't have many movies that focuses on black culture & the importance of family as it is. All these movies that are steadily coming out that consists of white majority with little to no diversity. Everything is not about white people! It is not racist that a movie was more relatable to the black audience. It's plenty of movies that I don't relate to because of the white culture but I still watch because it's just a movie at the end of the day & ion care what race the cast is lol I care if it good or not... here's a few that are more relatable to white cultures during Christmas (National Lampoon's Christmas vacation, the Home alones, Christmas with the kranks, the holiday, & The family stone.) Just because you don't relate doesn't mean you can't enjoy the movie. Yes white & black people have different cultures but we are not about to stop making black movies just because it contains our culture & more blacks than white people. I looove my black movies but I also can watch ""Just go with it"", ""something borrowed"", ""sixteen candles"", ""the breakfast club"", ""just one of the guys"", or ""pretty in pink"" all day long & I don't relate to any of them. Grow up & if you don't like the movie you don't have to watch it, nobody's forcing you. We deserve movies that is relatable to us just like y'all have movies that are more relatable to you.

2016-12-11T13:41:12,"literally minutes ago I changed my mind about hallmark never casting an african American ensemble in their Christmas movies . Its 2016 and blacks have a tremendous pool in resources not excluding their own network BET. Their are oodles and oodles of competent actors, writers and directors not to mention well to do and wealthy blacks  in this country who  could  spearhead producing several yuletide movies leading up to Christmas. I'm sure any black person you ask would love to see that. The reason we don't? I think, in part, we have let the white american philosophy dictate what we do and who we are, and what we are quote unquote SUPPOSE to doing to consider ourselves black. We are so driven for success we cater to what we know white america will except and unfortunately that's usually scenaric plots with an over abundance of silliness or the other end of the spectrum ganglike excessive violence OR, and their number one plot of acceptance, period pieces where they lord over blacks and its politically correct to throw around the N word. So finally I'm really shocking myself where I don't care to see us projected fairly and more realistically by the white film industry. We should be doing that ourselves. So  I sincerely hope black people in those key positions in our society will start galvanizing this  untapped avenue  and bring to light some simple wholesome Christmas movies with the same touch of romance we are used to viewing on the hallmark channel.",0,0,BDaniel Davis,l6N5McMq7gM,0.0902777777777778,2016-12-11 13:41:12,False,True
