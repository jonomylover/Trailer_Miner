I make up my own mind. I may meet a bad boss who is a great friend, or a great boss who is a horrible friend. My thoughts about that person depend on whether I'm an employee or a friend. LoL if you like the actors in this movie, if you're okay with a slow build and characters without a lot of charisma that are still likeable, see this movie. Give it a clean slate. I won't spoil the movie, but I will give you some peace of mind, it had a definite ending. It doesn't just build up to the climax and go black. That was my biggest concern. I don't really like ambiguity. :) I hope you enjoy the scenery and appreciate the physical toll it must have taken to do these scenes. At the very least, you get to see some really cool planets and space scenery. :)  I'd like to add, for the people who are critical of the acting. My understanding is, it's hard enough to act when you have actual people and an environment to interact with/react to. I think these actors did a phenomenal job with a green screen and situations they have obviously never actually encountered.   (I'm so bored with a world where MOST PEOPLE HAVE A ""red pen""  at the ready to correct everyone else, whenever possible.) I rarely write reviews, but all of the critical reviews just...
