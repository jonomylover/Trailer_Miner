2020-02-09T21:07:12,Melissa has such great comedic timing. That’s what makes her films gold and never fails to bring laughter. She can say a somewhat bland or average line and make it funny. The same person can repeat her exact line and it will be just that - average. But Melissa just has that power and timing and tone and it all molds just perfectly to bring laughter. I love her for this. She’s great at making fun of herself and doing it like a champ BUT she’s also funny beyond that. People like Amy Schumer and Chelsea Handler are great but they really have no comedic skill beyond making fun of their gimmicks. Melissa is a comedy queen and I hope to see many more. And what can I say about Jason? His sexiness and incredible brilliance speaks for itself. A great action man who proved he’s also funny.,0,0,Robert Rogers,YrY3v1eDmQY,0.3601449275362319,2020-02-09 21:07:12,False,False
