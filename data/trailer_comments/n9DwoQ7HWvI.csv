However...here is mine....THIS MOVIE LOOKS INCREDIBLE!!! WOO!!!....Ahem. Sorry about that. But no seriously, I think it looks good! People are saying it looks worse then the Andrew Garfield films. Why? Peter in this one actually looks like a high school student, we are actually getting a new villain one that hasn't been done before, we're also getting an actual Avenger to be Peter's mentor how cool is that?!   Now alot of people keep bringing up the Sam Raimi films and saying how they were better. I understand where people are coming from. I, myself, grew up with those films and they will always have a special place in my heart. However I want to see something close to the comics. And I'm sorry, but emo Peter is not going to do it. Anyway, obviously we won't know until the movie is out if it's good or not.

You cant really do that with your company mascot. Spiderman is marvel's poster boy, up there, in my opinion, with the four most popular comic characters ever created (superman, batman, spiderman and wolverine) Spiderman is in an other league, and deserves a grander scale movie. This film just looks like another set up movie for something like infinity war. Whats with all this emphasis on the avengers, I guess you could mention them a little but I want the film to feel street level crime fighter for the little guy. in the comics spiderman keeps to himself mostly and doest associate with the avengers regularly. I personally like how spiderman defeated all his foes on his own and that his responsibilities are his alone to bare. When you see him with iron man the whole time it kinda ruins that personal vendetta touch. I just feel that tone that the marvel movies use in their other properties works for smaller characters, but when you threat your star player like the rest of the team, it kinda depreciates him. The color grading also doesn't work, it looks so flat.

Fresh talent and cgi don't make a good film friends.  I personally can't say I've ever enjoyed any spiderman film to date which is disappointing. The original Spiderman 2 wasnt horrible, but can't say I was entertained...#1 had bad effects/tons of cheesiness, and 3 was a total disaster trying to fit too many character storylines in, plus that horrible dance number...what was sam thinking?!? Venom and carnage deserve their own films. Sandman was generic, and dafoe could have had a great goblin take if the suit didn't look like a 90s power rangers knock off..he lobbied hard for that part and the studio should have given him a better costume. Foxx as electro/and the rhino character were a total joke...he should have been shocker if anything, though alfred molina as doc oc was spot on..best villian of any of the films no question.",7,1,richardkanemusic,n9DwoQ7HWvI,0.10079710144927537,2016-12-09 06:35:34,True,True

2016-12-09T07:07:58,"I hope they do this movie justice - too many reboots. I definitely like the overall direction they're taking with Peter/Spidey and his development so far as making him more naive, optimistic and impressionable. Also I dig the choice of MIchael Keaton as Vulture - I'm sure he's gonna rock that part. Plus hopefully there will be no direct interference from Sony to include like, 10,000,000 milestones in one movie and turn it into a slushie of the most important moments in Peter's life.  Plus: Keaton as Vulture Tom nails Peter and Spidey really well Marisa as a hot Aunt May is interesting, could be good including Tony ties it directly into the upcoming Infinity War trilogy His friend who acts as comic relief seems convincing Having bank robbers wearing Avengers masks was a nice touch It's an interesting choice to start with one of the first love interests Peter and Flash fought over - that says to me Marvel cares about getting the details from the comics right at least in some ways, also I think Vulture was one of his earliest villains unless I'm mistaken. Time will tell if they have the same chemistry as Garfield and Stone though. Because Maguire and Dunst were about as awful as Portman and Christianson.  Minus: Why high school again for the 3rd time? Are we ever going to see a 20-something Spidey that sticks around or is he eternally 17 and rebooted on film?  Unsure: I like the overall tone of the trailer a lot - a nice balance between High School angst and crime fighting drama - sets a nice balance of drama and comedy to keep it fresh and lighthearted at times yet serious and awe inspiring most of the time. Hopefully the actual movie has that tone since the trailers can be so misleading and doesn't fall into being super campy. I felt like they already nailed that tone once in his initial appearance in Civil War. Here's hoping they can do it again.",0,0,heathenbreathinfire,n9DwoQ7HWvI,0.21040293040293043,2016-12-09 07:07:58,True,True

Just stay true to the comics please. We don't need female Thor etc...  If you want to empoyer blacks/latinos/Asian/gays/women... please do it right. Black panther is how you do it right. Furiosa is how you do it right.  But please stop forcing quotas of colors and gender for political reasons. It's becoming so noticable in the past few years that it is breaking the immersion of many movies.  Empoyer non-white characters and female ones. But don't force their presence to meet a quota.

2016-12-09T08:01:50,"Okay, so as fun as this trailer makes the movie look i find it problematic that iron man has so much involvement in spider-man's backstory. While i don't have a problem with fun and uplifting superhero stories that don't focus too much on the pain and turmoil a character goes through, since god knows we get enough of that from batman, I just think it works to the detriment of Peter's character since the whole point of Spider-man is that he is the ""Everyman Superhero"" who deals with all the real life problems you and I would have  on top of fighting villains. But with Tony around Peter Parker will have zero life problems. Any bills that would need to be paid, any bullies that would need to be dealt with, and any girls he would need to impress would all just be completely solved by Tony. While I will still wait in anticipation to see this on opening day I just don't think were gonna get a proper Spider-man movie.......but I could be wrong.

People complain that it looks shit, guys, it's Marvel, it will be great! People complain that the Amazing Spider-Man has ended... what? That shit ended years ago, y'all still going on about that. We already knew Tom Holland was playing Spider-Man!  People complain that this is the third reboot. As if this is something they heard today. And also, Batman and Superman have gotten more reboots than Spidey. Marvel took over Spider-Man, we've seen that Spider-Man in Civil War, he stole the show and he will probably continue to do so.

It has a great cast, it has a great trailer, they didn't spoil anything of the story, they showed you stuff to get excited about, so no matter what you say, it is a well made trailer.

He was made to be black, his design draws inspiration from Barrack Obama and Donald Glover, and that is his character. If you want to branch out and reach minorities, use him, don't just make random characters black for no reason. Elizabeth Allan Osbourne being turned into a minority doesn't help the story or help minorities identify with the movie more. It's just dumb and disrespectful to everyone.   The worst part is, that is probably the least important issue of the movie. Too much Papa Tony bullshit going on, and while I love a lot of the Marvel movies, this looks like another shitty setup for Avengers movies. I feel like this will be just like Iron-Man 2, no one will outright shit on the movie, but it's clearly not good or what anyone wanted. It's so sad too, because The Vulture is one of my favorite villains and I was happy to see him being added in, but this looks like a total mess.

That suggests the events in the film take place before Civil War, yet the Vulture is supposedly introduced after Civil War, when Spider-Man has the upgraded suit because Peter goes to the Avengers Head Quarters to talk to Stark about the new menace. So does Civil War take place in Homecoming, meaning Spidey battles both Vulture and Shocker in his home made spider suit before going to Germany in Civil War, where he then gets his upgraded suit and has round 2 with Vulture and Shocker after Civil War. Or in Homecoming, is the upgraded suit damaged and Spider-Man is forced to use his old suit to fight Shocker and Vulture.

Now everything happened the opposite of his expectations and the last half of the movie is him fixing everything. By the near end of the movie he asked Stark for help they talk and then they team up to fight Vulture. End credits is probably him officially being a member of the Avengers.   Theory: Stark actually took Vulture's coming as an opportunity to test Peter. That's why he never did anything about the vulture.

First off, Tobey & Andrew fans:  Look, Tom's the new Spider-Man now, get over it.  And those of you who are complaining about his age, take it from a High School girl, no teenage guy looks like Andrew. Tom looks closer to that age then Andrew ever did not to mention the fact that he actually is closer in age to Peter than Andrew.  Another thing, some (not all) of you have been judging Tom since he was casted in Civil War before even watching the movie.  Please stop because that's childish as well.  You're not even giving him a chance before you judge him.  Tom's just as much of a fan of the character as you.  If you watch him from the perspective of a comic book fan, you actually see how much of an amazing Peter and Spider-Man he does.  Second, you racist MJ & Gwen fans: Neither the love interest or Zendaya's character are MJ or Gwen so take a chill pill. The names are Michelle and Liz Allen... look it up if you're not a real comic book fan & are judging this movie before even watching it. Also, do you think that it's accurate in the real world for the entire girl cast to be white? Well, if you think it is then you're ignorant. They're adding diversity to the cast and take it from this real comic book fan that doesn't care because it's realistic to the scenario.

Which I have to say I guess because it was new I thought it was awesome. But wow do the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies not hold up. Just rewatched 1st two and blah. Didn't have to rewatch part 3. That was shit instantly. So much so I blame it for why Tobey Maguire doesn't act no more. One scene did. I mean whole movie was shit. But Peter Parker dancing down the street like I was watching Saturday Night Fever was atrocious.

While I'm happy the Vulture is confirmed to be the main villain in the movie, The Tinkerer and the Shocker are supposed to be in it as well. While I can understand the Tinkerer being there as he builds all of vulture's tech, The shocker I think is kinda pushing it, as well as the fact that there's supposed to be another villain in it as well. That's a lot of villains for just one movie, and it's causing me to fear that it might end up how Spider-Man 3 did. I'm worried that the movie won't be able to handle as much of the villains as it's said the film is supposed to have, and that scares me. Heck Avengers only had one villain and several heroes. But it could just be me overreacting cause there are a ton of movies that could handle multiple villains really well. Batman Returns was able to handle its 3 villains just fine, And since Iron Man is supposed to be in Homecoming as well, That may help balance it out.",0,0,The Norgal of the Hills,n9DwoQ7HWvI,0.3152777777777778,2017-01-29 12:09:41,True,True

Just like spidey is in the comics he is still learning the ropes to being a hero and now he can interact with his role models tony and cap and since he is young we won't see him go to college or get married within 3 movies.

2017-04-15T05:37:06,"One thing I really hope this movie has is depth. I think that the Amazing spiderman series never lived up to its potential by trying to maintain so many different plots. I like the idea of a comedic, amateur spiderman roaming the streets of Manhattan and being mentored along the way, but I don't think that encompasses the tone of the comics completely. In the comics, Peter was conflicted with whether or not what he was doing was right, whether he was saving more lives than he probably ruined. On top of that, Spiderman was supposed to not be who he was, but who Pete wanted to be. We've seen it before, Spiderman faces a foe but Peter Parker feels it's personal (like with the green goblin and Gwen stacy) and begins to feel pressured and loses his sense of reason. In these cases, Peter crosses a line, and later suffers the consequences of it. I'm not asking for a Batman movie (haha Michael Keaton), but maybe just a little drama in Pete's life that really makes him question his morals or his purpose. or even, maybe some consequences to things like arrogance, immaturity, compromised actions, or just some that can't be avoided. Anyone else hope for a LITTLE of this in the movie?

Spider-Man Spiderman50.jpg Cover of The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2, #50 (April 2003) Art by J. Scott Campbell and Tim Townsend Publication information Publisher Marvel Comics First appearance Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) Created by Stan Lee (writer) Steve Ditko (artist) In-story information Alter ego Peter Benjamin Parker Species Human mutate Team affiliations Avengers Daily Bugle Future Foundation New Avengers Jean Grey School for Higher Learning Abilities  Superhuman strength, speed and agility Ability to cling to most surfaces Genius-level intellect Precognitive Spider-sense Utilizes web-shooters to shoot strong spider-web strings from wrists Spider-Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crime-fighter. Spider-Man's creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices of his own invention, which he calls ""web-shooters"", and react to danger quickly with his ""spider-sense"", enabling him to combat his foes.  When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, the high school student behind Spider-Man's secret identity and with whose ""self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness"" young readers could relate.[1] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that ""with great power there must also come great responsibility""‚Äîa line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben.  Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is titled The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character has developed from shy, nerdy high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2010s, he joins the Avengers, Marvel's flagship superhero team. Spider-Man's nemesis Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012‚Äì2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die.[2] Separately, Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death.",0,0,Jack_1231,n9DwoQ7HWvI,0.1302106094963237,2017-05-04 17:27:01,True,True

2017-07-14T07:47:26,"*SPOILINIG THE ENTIRE MOVIE* I don't know how Stan lee could could happy with this. My god. Spider-Man never needed a high tech suit, with all the gadgets and a damn voice helping him like batman and iron man. They made him look pathetic and took away his intelligence. Spider man relied on his abilities, not tech. This movie made iron man look responsible for the creation and power behind Spider-Man. Any kid could have been potentially Spider-Man with iron mans help then. Other than sticking to walls according to this movie. No spidey sense and no further explanation on his abilities. Next... Flash. What were they thinking with him? A small indian kid, smaller than Tom Holland even?! Not a jockand hardly intimidating. That's no t flash. He's supposed to be a dumb jock and bully. Not a hardly noticeable nerd bully on a math team picking on Peter. Aunt may... Why the hell make her a hot mom figure. She's suppose to be old, not long luscious hair and sexy. People hitting on her all the time. Wtf?  Also the webbing. Spider-Man's webbing was  lame and made him look oblivious to using it. He barely created it, tony did all the work. Other than a moment in class we saw him making some  and the end where he used his old webbing. His love interest was dumb and they made the vulture her dad... Like really? And then end put a nail in the coffin: The Michelle random character calling herself MJ. Please no. She cannot be or replace Mary Jane. And can't even nod to Gwen Stacy. There was so much political correct crap in this. I don't mind changing the characters into other races, but doing it just for the sake of doing it was stupid. Oh and people figured out who Spider-Man was quickly. The vulture, his friend, iron man obviously, and drum roll....his aunt May. Already aunt May?? Unless they make another movie and add a dumb excuse like, oh I just like the costume and I made one. How pathetic. Also, I don't think he actually wins a single fight in this movie as well. If not for the interference of others (or their mercy), he would have lost every time. In fact, he doesn't actually beat the main villain at the end of the movie! If not for the fact that the Vulture decides to grab a crate of tech (that explodes) rather than finishing him off, then the villain wins and the hero is destroyed. What else... Tons of other internal inconsistencies abound - he's strong enough to catch cars but he can't punch through glass - he knocks himself out by jumping into the top of a tractor trailer but can have an entire building dumped on him without injury, etc. Everything about this characterization can be summed up in one word: incompetence. Just everything about this movie killed my inner child and spat in my face for making comic book and cartoons of my beloved Spider-Man a waste of time.  RIP spidey in the movies. They can't get a simple concept down of him. They have to add a bunch of garbage.  I want to say if I knew nothing about Spider-Man, this movie was good. But if you just want to be entertained by Marvel's own storyline, that's fine too, still I can't help but think this was a spit in the face of the fans who grew up with spidey.",72,44,Julia Flohr,n9DwoQ7HWvI,-0.011375437180521926,2017-07-14 07:47:26,False,True

If this is the case the Stanley did not do the Spider-Man movie. No wonder why I was disappointed in the Spider-Man movie. All I did was just wasted money when I went to go see this.

I saw Toby as a crybaby every movie( Even though Andrew and Tom cried as well Toby did it for 3 movies.)I still liked his performance as Peter Parker but not Spider-Man. Andrew was my second favorite mostly because of his performance as Spider-Man, even though he said he didn't fit in the role as Peter Parker...he's my second best. Tom played both parts the best...his Spider-Man and Peter Parker was perfect...although one thing I didn't like was Karen and I'm sure many people agree but at the end of the movie it shows that Peter doesn't need it. Overall, I'm not hating on the original trilogy, I think they were decent films. In my personal opinion Tom is Spider-Man.

2018-05-06T12:40:19,"(almost) Exactly midway through the movie, you can see the portrait of the writer Franz Kafka. This is one of the greatest abstractions of all time. Whoever says Marvel movies are stupid just does not have a fine resolution. The reason it's a great abstraction: this movie is a reference not only to ""The Metamorphosis"" which talks about a man who turned into a bug that tries to hide itself from other people, but to at least another literary piece: ""The Trial"". In one of the chapters of this short story, the protagonist attempts to enter a court to argue against an accusation brought upon him, but an intimidating gatekeeper does not allow him to enter yet. After waiting many years in front of the door, the dying man asks the gatekeeper: how come nobody tried to go through the door but me? The gatekeeper, seeing that the man became frail replied that this door was only assigned to him. He then closes the door and leaves. The ending of spiderman is opposite to that in a sense that Peter Parker thought that Tony Stark was testing him and that he had no intention of making him one of the Avengers. At the end, you can see that Tony, Pepper and Happy were euphoric and relieved that the kid said ""No"". Tony even gave the kid a perfunctory chance. Another way in which this movie was kafkaesque is that Peter never kissed his crush and she had to leave (instead Tony kissed Pepper Pots).",0,0,TheSphinx,n9DwoQ7HWvI,0.14635416666666667,2018-05-06 12:40:19,False,False

2018-06-08T16:55:46,"GUYS I JUST HAD AN INSANE MARVEL THEORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (Btw the people who bare to read this whole thing are true marvel fans.... Cause this is REALLY long and only a serious Marvel fan would appreciate it.)  What if, Tony had a son...16 years ago... But he didn't know it! Then some evil dude (Thanos' bother.... Let's call him... Thexor for now) came to Tony during Civil war, and told him that 16 years ago, he got a girl pregnant. The mother died during the child's birth, but Tony was the father!!  Thexor obviously told him he has a son just for leverage, but Tony was completely shaken.  Thexor is a an extremely powerful being from another planet (like thanos). He has a metal claw for a left hand, and can emit plasma rays from a stone implanted in his right hand. He has plasma thrusters in his boots that allow him to fly like iron man. His body is covered in gold armor, and he stands 12 feet tall.  He said if Tony ever got in his way from getting whatever he wants, he would kill His son.  Tony did everything in his power to find the kid, then eventually after a year of looking for him, TONY FOUND HIS SON!!.... Peter Parker! He dug up everything he could about Peter, (which explains how he knew Peter was Spider-Man in Spider-Man homecoming) and he went to see him! Asking Peter Fight along side him in civil war was just an excuse for Tony to be around Peter. But all his life, Peter was told his parents died in a car accident, so Tony couldn't tell him the truth. Aunt May knows Tony is the father which explains why she's ""Not a fan of Tony Stark"" as she's said multiple times in SM homecoming. Cause she's afraid if Peter knew the truth, he would leave May for Tony.  Then in Spider-man 2 (2019), TONY COMES CLEAN!!!!! Tony is fighting the extremely dangerous Thexor again, and he's reminding Tony of what he told him a year ago. If he ever even tries to stop him, he'll kill Peter!! Right in front of him!! And it would be on Starks conscience. (hence the references in SM Homecoming, and Infinity war) and just then, Peter sees a huge plasma explosion from his house, that's over near the water where Tony is fighting Thexor. Peter sees iron man get shot out of the sky so he gets his suit on and rushes all the way to the shore!! (The same shore Where he previously fought Vulture) He jumps in the fight just as Thexor is about to shoot Tony again at his weak state after being shot out of the sky with a plasma Ray!!! Spider-Man jumps in and stops him seconds before he kills Tony!! Peter tries to stop him and save stark but Thexor is too strong! Peter can't hold him back any longer! He shoots Peter into the water! (Peter can't swim btw, especially with the iron-spider suit Tony designed for him) Tony tries to go save him but his thrusters are down! Thexor starts walking into the ocean toward Peter, where he's drowning and calling out for Tony! Peter can't struggle anymore and he starts to sink. Thexor is walking closer and closer toward Peter. Tony tries to get out of the suit so he can try to save Peter but the computer system is on the fritz from the blast. Tony can barely stand much less try to get out of his suit! He starts crawling toward Peter with all the strength he has left! Thexor reaches Peter before Tony can even get in the water! Peter is 50 yards out, and almost to the ocean floor. He's passed out. Thexor reaches down with his extendable claw-hand and grabs Peter and pulls him out of the water! (Still unconscious) he throws him straight towards the shore as hard As he can! Peter gets smashed into a building just on the shore! Almost dead! Cuts across his face, barley alive, broken arm! Thexor starts coming out of the water walking toward Peter. (Trying to kill Peter cause Tony tried to stop Thexor from ripping the bridge apart, which is how the whole fight started.)  Tony is trying to get to his feet but he's too weak. He can't stand. Thexor is out of the water, walking towards Peter just as he's starting to snap out of it. Peter is stuck in the side of a building, he can't breathe or move. He needs stark. Thexor is right in front of Peter, plasma hand to peters face, about to shoot...  ""Mr. Stark.... Help..."" Peter whispered using every bit of strength he had. Tony was still laying on the shore 20 yards away, unable to move, watching in horror as Thexor was about to kill his son...  ""Mr. Stark?..."" Thexor said. In a slightly confused manner. ""So you haven't told him!?""  Stark looked at Peter horrified!  ""Hasn't told me what?"" Peter said, again with little breath to spare.  ""Go on stark...."" Thexor said encouragingly... ""THE KID DESERVES THE TRUTH!!""   Thexor then picked Peter up and threw him on the sand Near stark.  ""TELL HIM WHY HE NEVER HAD A FATHER GROWING UP!! WHY HE NEVER HAD A FAMILY!! TELL HIM WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO HIS PARENTS, STARK!!!!!!""   ""M-my parents?-"" Peter said trying to catch his breath... ""W-what would he know about my parents? T-t-they died in-in a car accident when I was a baby! There's... There's no way he could know who--...""  Peter glanced over at Tony... Tears filling Starks eyes...Peter had never seen him look so worried.  ""M-mr. Stark...?"" ""....did you know my parents???....""  ""Peter...."" Tony tried to explain with tears rolling down his face... ""17 years ago...I--"" ""Well, I--""  Peters eyes were filling with tears, his voice was shaking... ""DID YOU KNOW MY PARENTS???!!!!!""  Tony looked at Peter and knew nothing would ever be the same. Peter was horrified! Stark didn't know what was going to happen. All he knew was there was no way around it... His throat was closing in, he could barely breathe...  ""Peter..."" He said with a weak voice........ ""I'm your father...""  Peters eyes wide open, trying to make sense of it all, rested his head on the sand, giving up. He couldn't win the battle... Not like this.  Thexor raised his plasma hand pointed at Peter. Peter noticed but didn't move. It was over.... Thexor shot it at Peter, but just then, Tony's adrenaline kicked in and he ran in front of Peter! Tony quickly took out a shield he installed in his suit to reflect the plasma Ray off the shield and aim it towards Thexor! Thexor disintegrated into ashes and was blown across the sand. Tony fell to the ground. His suit reached max potential. It was destroyed! Peter tried to get up to see if Tony was okay...  ""You saved me?..."" Peter said a little confused but relieved.  ""...well... What kind of father would I be if I didn't?"" Tony said kinda joking.  They both sighed in relief....    THE END!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
