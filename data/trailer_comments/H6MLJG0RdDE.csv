It's like he's trying to make a damn marvel cinematic universe with all these shitty ass movies he produces and says ""it's part of the conjuring universe"". James Wan either needs to start directing movies again or stop producing shit sequels to his good movies. I remember the Conjuring being really big because of realism and how close it felt to the supernatural and then it all got ruined when Annabelle and so on was released because of the stretch between fiction and non-fiction. You can't just inflate movies with bullshit when you're trying to make them as realistic and as scary/horror related as you can. Sorry for the huge rant, but James Wan is ruining the hollywood horror seen. I'm just glad to see a duo like this in the mix lately, the hollywood horror scene needs a bit of redemption and this movie will hopefully deliver on something good, maybe James Wan can go help DC defeat Rotten Tomatoes for a while, make a fucking aquatard sequel lmao",0,0,Harlan Craig,H6MLJG0RdDE,0.06760397340754486,2019-05-02 14:22:28,True,True

2019-05-02T19:32:45,"No,no, no. People have got to stop making thriller/killer animal movies like this. It's way too many cheap gimmicks used to actually make the movie suspenseful.   Here's how Jaws worked. Giant shark(the one exception out in the wild) guys on a boat going to kill the shark. Easy and done. The same goes for Anaconda and Python. Giant animals out to kill or be killed in a tropical forest. Deep Blue Sea, gmo sharks angry and smart. The last example of how this works well the fucking Greys, stranded in Wilderness pack of wolves, try and survive. Heck even Cujo was scary.   Nowadays, directors and studios take any animal, says fuck to how they actually act in nature and then toss in people in some dumb coincidence. I'm safe in a shark cage but trapped 47 meters down. or this shark wont leave the shallows, or I'm trapped under a pool cover.   Suspenseful/claustrophobic scenarios work in films like Phonebooth or ATM, because the antagonist was a human character acting with malice intent and that's believable.   Why on Earth would a gang of Alligators be so adamant about eating people during a hurricane, even if their nest is near or beneath your house. What Alligator would take a gunshot and continue attacking.    This movie is building its suspense on a family willingly hiding in a crawl space in their house , when common sense if you want to be rescued in this situation tells you to climb on top of your roof or jsut get out of the fucking house.

So many things are over dramatic and it looks like it relies heavily on shock factors. It's kind of like what my friend said about San Andreas ‚Ä¶ ""OK when are they bringing out the fucking T Rex?"" And if she hit her head like that on the glass at that Force especially at the back of the head, she'd be knocked completely unconscious. Then with all the wounds she had with that dirty flood water rushing in with all that debris, she'd be getting infections instantly. Also crocodiles don't move that damn fast. And I guess now one of the trendy things of horror movies is to show people bashing their head on glass windows with blood going everywhere. Like I said, I give it points for originality. But I think this movie seems like it relies way too much on shock Factor.",0,0,Guitar Ninja Cat,H6MLJG0RdDE,0.028925619834710748,2019-05-02 19:51:23,True,True

Also it takes alot of energy for gators to open their mouths because those muscles are weak this is why tappers jump on their backs and push their mouths close.

On land they are fairly slow and barely run. 3 why is there a basement in Florida as no house in Florida actually has a basement as the ground is literally right on top of the waterline making it impossible to even build one. We have to build the foundation first then the house no basement. You May find a basement in the northern counties but those are commercial ones like hospitals or something. Central, gulf, and south Florida it doesn't exist. We can't dig two feet without hitting water. Disney solved the water by digging into the ground and creating the cast member area then dumped a ton of dirt on top that is dry.

We (my little bro and I) asked my Dad if we could walk to the corner store for some snacks around 8 at night and since in NC we walked to the store all the time across paths ect it really wasn't a big deal. The store was across this large body of tall grass and not thinking too much I decided to walk through this large grassy area instead of walking around because it was a much shorter path to the store... We go and come back with no issues, well other than some grass moving sounds but we thought it was small animals like a bull frog or raccoon. Well the next morning we get up and ask if we can go get some doughnuts from that same store... We start heading towards the grassy area and all of a sudden ppl start screaming at us from across the street and waving frantically to run out of it. Well come to find out that ""path"" we thought we were following were actually gator paths and ppl had been attacked/killed in that same area before. I was maybe 12 and my brother 7... Horrifying possibilities to think about to be honest. We were so small that if either of us would've been attacked it would've been a done deal. Haha haven't been back to Florida since, I just don't like being that close to animals that can kill me.

I've lived in florida all my life and I have moved all around this state. Since when do we have these houses with crawl spaces? lmao but i will say that during hurricane irma our house started flooding but us being crazy florida people decided to go outside with big barn brooms in the storm and shove the water away from the carport as my dad decided last minute to make sand bags.

2019-05-04T17:52:00,1:37 It's a good concept for a movie but the trailer ruins the whole thing. Why do they put those loud quick thuds on trailers for emphasis? Why didn't they just play it down and have the Alligator/s lurking under the water ominously to add to the tension of her trying to rescue her dad whilst battling the flood. Both threats are two parts of Mother Nature. One is a natural element. The other is a natural predator. The flood being this unstoppable outspoken force would work in complete contrast of the silent lurking Alligator/s lingering in the shadows.

This movie looks pretty scary, I don't know which is worse alligators or chimps. When Michael hit in our town there wasn't all that much flooding, it was just like a big shrapnel bomb of wind that knocked down all of our trees. We were trapped in our neighborhoods with no way to drive out until the trees were moved and no cell service. It a perfect set up for a horror film. Of course I don't see people sticking around in place prone to flooding. Panama City has had several small and unimpressive hurricanes come through and evacuation is more trouble that someone who hasn't lived through one would realize. When we went to bed the night before the storm it was only cat 2 but by the next morning it had turned into a cat 4 and when it made land fall it was a cat five so we didn't have time to leave.

And most structures in florida are built to withstand hurricanes, so the worst that that may happen is power getting cut off, street flooding, and fallen trees.

Category five hurricane would be a lot worse than that, they should be screwed even before the murder alligators actually start to wage war. Underwhelming as shit. 2. Excuse me why the fuck are alligators acting like zombies after a human. Seriously if a hurricane were to hit all the alligators would try to lay low underwater, under riverbank erosion, and generally take shelter. Just because they are very aquatic doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre dumb enough to try swimming around during a category five hurricane. The premise of a large alligator getting stuck in a basement and actively trying to kill a couple people the ENTIRE time in the middle of HORRIBLE conditions even for alligators is small as fuck, maybe if the gator is starving, MAYBE. 3. Why the hell has this girl gotten bitten by a 12-15 foot alligator about 10 times with little effect? She should have been dead after the second or third time. Use a LITTLE realism movie otherwise fuck yourself with an alligator tail. 4. In my personal opinion the movie Jaws was shit, but also why the hell is this movie trying to copy Jaws, say what you will it‚Äôs pretty blatant and it‚Äôs unoriginal.  Fuckin‚Äô sick of movies presenting animals as evil bloodthirsty death machines, they‚Äôre just trying to live their lives and unlike a human in the modern bubble, they‚Äôre out there trying to be efficient and safe. Why the hell does the predator always roar before attacking, why does the predator keep attacking even if the victims (humans usually) elude it for hours and hours, especially ambush predators like sharks and alligators, which we are oh so fond of stigmatizing.

2019-07-12T03:51:24,"I lived in Florida from 1981 to 2015. I can tell you that a lot of the comments that were made about Florida are correct. Almost 84% of Florida homes are without basements, due to the fact of the low water table. Almost anywhere in Florida if to dig down 3 feet you will hit water, and I'm not saying that you will punch through in to water. I'm saying the hole will start filling up with water from the water saturated ground. To have a basement in Florida is extremely expensive. Now as for the alligator situation. The truth on that is, that the population of alligators is overwhelming. I love alligators, I have worked directly with them at Gator Land Zoo, and also at Jungle Land Zoo. The way they act in this movie, is in no way there true behavior. Most Florida alligators will try to stay away from humans, unless they have been fed by them. But in the wild, they can be extremely aggressive. And they will come after you, especially close to their nests. Alligators that live in the wild that have little to no human contact are completely different then the ones you may see in the neighborhood pond. They will hunt you, just as they would any other animal they come in contact with, and they don't give up easily. They hunt on land, and water. When I lived in Florida. I have seen them in people's pools, and they have even attacked people when they were trying to get into there vehicles. Alligators love to hide under cars and trucks, and they will grab you when you try to get in. just because your not in the water, in Florida you are still not safe. Anywhere you are in that state you have to be on guard. Alligators will walk miles through the woods to move to a different lake, even up to 10 miles or more. Anyway I'm posting to much, just really wanted to let people out there know, that alligators are definitely dangerous, and are not to be underestimated, of all the years I worked with them, and all of my years of experiences. I will tell you this. They show no mercy, and they feel no pain! If one is after you, getting away is your only option. Don't try to fight with them. The movies are fake. Hitting them with something, or stabbing them with a knife won't make them go away. When I worked at the zoo, I have seen one alligator bite the leg off of another alligator, and the one that was losing the leg, acting like it didn't even care, like it didn't even feel it. So don't think hitting it with something will stop it from killing you! But the way the movie people make them out to be, is way off. Once a alligator eats it might not eat again for weeks when the meal is large like a human, or large animal. There not like JAWS that eats 10 people, and two boats. Anyway here I go again. So I will stop by saying this. Don't believe movies when it comes to alligators or sharks. Just keep in mind, it is just a movie. But if you are ever in Florida, remember all bodies of water should be considered to have alligators and snakes, and always be careful when walking by the water or in the woods.

2019-07-14T04:37:53,"sooo...as a native Texan who grew up around gators and encounters at least one everyday on my evening walk.......this movie was just absolutely so bad that I spent the entire movie making notes on everything that was wrong with it. I guess the people who gave this disaster 88% rating on rotten tomatoes must be from new york or Canada and have no idea how hurricanes or gators work.  a. Florida DOES NOT HAVE BASEMENTS! Houses inland are mostly on stilts.  b. Gators DO NOT GROWL!  they hiss when  made extremely angry and that usually takes a lot of work because gators are very docile and shy creatures.  c. Gators DO NOT have RED EYES! their eyes glow in the dark but nothing more!  d. You will NEVER see a swim meet taking place when a hurricane is about to make landfall! All cities in the path of the hurricane become ghost towns and you don‚Äôt have people worried about ‚Äúswim meets‚Äù!!!!!  e. Gators ARE NOT QUICK MOVERS AND SO FLEXIBLE!! The gators in this movie must have had their gator moms train them at olympic level gymnastics facilities because they were moving around like Tara Lapinsky! and Mischelle Kwan! They were twisting and twirling like ballerinas! The BIGGER the GATOR THE SLOWER AND LESS IT MOVES!! They usually take two steps and fall on their belly cause they don‚Äôt wanna be bothered by moving so much until they are ready to move again!  f. YOU will NEVER see a rescue helicopter in the middle of a freakin hurricane! You usually have to wait for days if you decide to ride it out for anyone to come get you. So Please stop with that BS!!!! People evacuate or stay and ince the hurricane has passed rescuers go outside to assess the damage and rescues begin!  g. GATORS HATE NOISE!! They actually move AWAY from LOUD NOISES instead of MOVING TOWARDS THE NOISE which is what this stupid movie potrayed! So banging on pipes is NOT GOING to Lead a gator TO YOU!  h. GATORS DONT NEST IN SEWER PIPES!! Gators will build nests along the grassline or isolated grass island in swamps so the hatchlings can swim right out onto the water to start feeding themselves! Gators dont build nests and have their eggs ‚Äúfloating around ‚Äú in sewer pipes!   i. If a gator grabs your arm YOU CANNOT JUST KEEP FIRING YOUR GUN INTO ITS MOUTH MANY TIMES HOPING THAT IT DIES! And come out with minor damage when it lets go! FIRSTLY! GATORS DONT LET GO! they practice a death grip and their jaws lock onto the pray. YOU WILL BE IN NO CONDITION TO ACTUALLY FIRE A GUN MULTIPLE TIMES IF A GATOR HAS YOUR ARM IN ITS MOUTH!! Even if you manage to kill it ITS JAW WONT RELAX and it won‚Äôt let go!!  j. GATORS DONT COME AFTER PEOPLE! They are actually very docile and shy and avoid people at all costs unless you are threatening or disturbing a gators nest!! If you encounter a gator it will usually slip away into the water and AVOID YOU!!!  k. GATORS DONT HUNT!! I almost laughed when the guy went ‚ÄúThey hunt when they hear splashing, no splashing..no hunting ‚Äú NO YOU IDIOTS!! GATORS ARE OPPORTUNISTIC FEEDERS!! They will eat turtles etc if they are hungry and that is usually once a week! THEY DONT ACTIVELY GO LOOKING FOR FOOD unless they get lucky to grab a dog or cat as a treat. Gator hate expending energy especially on ‚Äúhunting‚Äù üòÇ they will eat whatever is around and then go back to laying around and not moving unless absolutely needed!!!  l. Another part that made me crack up was the ‚Äúeye of the hurricane ‚Äú that lasted 30 seconds üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ considering they said it was such a HUGE HURRICANE!! They just sat there for 30 seconds and they eye passed them? really!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I am not even going to explain that because its so sad!  m. There are no ‚Äúgiant waves‚Äù that come and crash into houses!! Inland flooding happens gradually over time!!! This movie pretty much combined a movie and a tsunami together! üòêüòêüòê  The last place you will see gators trying to ‚Äúhunt‚Äù is a hurricane!! Most likely they will go deep water and avoid your family drama and try to attack you people!! Also gators that size would never be caught dead with each other!! Gators have territory that extends many miles and they WOULD RATHER be FIGHTING EACH OTHER IF THEY WERE IN SUCH AN ENCLOSED SPACE Rather than worry about your human ass if they were that size!!!  Its movies like this that remind us why humans are so new and reptiles have been around a lot longer..geez...ALSO! FLARE GUNS Don‚Äôt KILL GATORS OR EVEN PENETRATE THEIR SKIN!
