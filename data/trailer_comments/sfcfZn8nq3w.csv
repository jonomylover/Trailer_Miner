2017-07-30T12:03:05,"Honestly, to me this movie would have been better if it wasn't so focused on the relationship with her and the cop. Cause to me it's like she needed this man in order to realize she needs to be herself. would have rather seen her try and be herself BY HERSELF to show strength, and to just show that she can take control of her life BY HERSELF. Not with the help of some man and hard feelings. To me that's just typical and annoying. This movie should have focused WAY more on her timeline of becoming famous and her bad relationship with her mother. I felt like I didn't get enough of that - I really didn't care for the relationship part of the story.",0,1,Dria Woods,sfcfZn8nq3w,0.071969696969697,2017-07-30 12:03:05,False,False
