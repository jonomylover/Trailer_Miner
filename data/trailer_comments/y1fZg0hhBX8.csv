These are copies of exact expressions of ideas, which are unique and one of a kind... they add the magic to the old story. There are also kindly good giants with white hair, and bad, ugly giants in each story. The big question, for now, is if these stunning, magical images appear in the original story. I am sure they did not, but this must be verified.. then a major IP attorney will be contacted. Once the entire film is seen, no doubt additional unique and strikingly similar images, copird from Goldberg's 'Giants' may be found. They don't have to copy the entire story, just the magic, which can be applied to another interesting and somewhat similar one.

2017-01-16T09:03:42,"Having watched the movie: I have some pros and cons on it. *Possible spoilers ahead*  Pros: Liked the giant, cool character, great development, well fleshed out. Sophie was good, the actress who played her did a good job and I enjoyed watching her.  The scenery was interesting, loved the tree/dream sequence and the whole it's his job with the dreams.  Like the London feel as well.  Cons: The story was interesting but somewhat shallow, Basically it's a guy being bullied by bigger guys.  It's not consistent with it's own genre. At one point it's dark and mysterious and then next some guy is riding on cars playing games, the emotional whiplash on that is stunning.  The ""farting"" scenes were totally out of place and very cringe worthy especially with the Queen that just gave it the..Saturday morning vibe you don't want from a movie that starts off looking/feeling epic. I literally at that Queen scene (almost all of it, but especially the breakfast scene) said ""What am I watching?"" ""Where is this supposed to be going"", and ""They could have just skipped this scene, it does nothing""  Final analysis: Looked epic and was good in places and if they had stayed with the BFG and his relationship with Sophie it would have been great, but diverting to this bully thing with the other giants (who are bigger than him so kind of negates the B in BFG), that green drink and the queen (which if had been redone probably could have worked better, really pulled the film down.

The main disadvantages to this version in my opinion, from what I can remember, are the bad giants, and part of the ending.¬† I'll put then ending in the reply, so¬†it can be avoided, but the evil¬†giants were too silly to be threatening, like they relied on the BFG to fix their ""boo-boos"", which is¬†quite a contrast to the bullying giants of the book, and the monstrous looking giants of the cartoon.",0,0,MJN SEIFER,y1fZg0hhBX8,-0.10611111111111109,2019-11-13 15:46:27,False,False
