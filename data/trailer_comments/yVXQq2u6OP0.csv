I can tell you, I've read Jon Spaihts' (amazing) script and the trailer doesn't spoil anything. I was surprised of a few things that happened in the script and none of those surprises are in this trailer. This trailer simply shows you that two people have woken up on a spaceship and they soon fall in love. Sure, there's going to be action, it's set in space, it'd be really boring if it just focused on Jennifer and Chris' characters.  Can't we just be happy that, in the midst of all the remakes & sequels we've had this year (far too many to count), we're getting a film that is fresh and original. It's not like Wall-E, it's not like 'Titanic in space' and it's not like Gravity. Just because they feature romance and it's a sci-fi doesn't mean it's going to be unlike any other film we've already seen.  Who cares if you don't like Jennifer Lawrence or Chris Pratt? In my opinion, I find Pratt to be annoying but that won't stop me watching this film as I've been looking forward to it for the past year.  See the film, don't see the film, it's up to you. Please don't moan that it's spoilt everything because it hasn't, I promise you. It's impossible to include the whole film (90-120mins long) in 2min26sec long trailer.

Then agent smith hacks the ships control center and sets the course to the Sun, which will consume the entire ship. Agent Smith then kills everyone who is in hyper sleep, except Jennifer Lawerence, who is actually mystic from X-men. Mystic wakes up to find Chris Pratt and they fall in love, however Agent smith plans to kill Pratt. Morpheus finds out and calls the Guardians of the galaxy to stop agent smith. As the guardians arrive, Morpheus actually turns out to be the main villain, and throws the guardians out of an airlock with Pratt. Agent Smith, who is actually an Android created by Morpheus, kills mystic. Morpheus and agent smith escape the ship with the Space ship left by the guardians, and fly off to Mars to kill their next target, Matt Damon. 90 years later, the space ship crash lands on the Planet Pandora, deep in the Ocean where the Avatars now worship this new entity from space as their new tree Goddess.",1,1,Bob Swertz,yVXQq2u6OP0,0.08467023172905523,2016-10-16 04:53:31,True,True

Also there must have been some fire protocols that may or may not had unlocked the door, he good try to smash the small window and start a fire in the crew room which may had opened the door for the crew to get of the room, long shot but its a possibility. Also there where 5000 passengers to which he had access, was there really not a single engineer in the passengers? He could check the bio of all of them and an engineer of that time with the resources that they had could do wonders. But even before we get to chris waking up, not having spare hibernation pods because none has ever malfunctioned has to be the stupidest plot hole in movie history, on a 500 trillion dollar mission they don't take the pro cation of  a pod failure and also why did they had only one shield? why not a secondary Shield that would protect the center of the ship where the reactor and the core machines lie?
