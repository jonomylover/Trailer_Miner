When Bill Murray realizes there are no consequences, he robs a bank, eats a buffet of dessert, jumps off a building, and lets a stolen groundhog drive his truck off a cliff.  When this chick realizes there are no consequences, she puts on slightly more makeup than usual, puts on a risque dress, gets into a fight with her friends, AND STILL GOES TO SCHOOL.  Why does this person on a time loop return time and time again to a place of teenage misery?  She didn't use her time warp in any imaginative way.  Within the first 5 minutes of the movie I was hoping all four girls died a horrible death.  So if you like the game Life is Strange, or thought Carrie would have been much better if they replaced the blood with beer from red solo cups, or thought Groundhog Day was too well-written, then this movie is for you!

2017-03-05T04:40:59,"Okay so I know I shouldn't judging these movie because of the trailer, but I will anyways. I've read the book and it's amazing, I totally loved it and how Lauren Oliver does write, really think it's a beautiful book with perfect characters that I imagined in a totally different way as they're  like in movie.  These is gonna be a really long commentary but I don't care and if you've read the book hope you could read these and give me your opinion because I don't have the whole truth, right? Well,  since beginning I didn't like the trailer. At all,  I think there's just a little part of it that I actually liked but most of it was, like I can see it, pretty much like ""not what I was expecting for"". Of course there's always this fear of movies ruining books,  but I totally think (Now that I watched the trailer, I raised the bet) you can keep the pictures you've created before in your head while reading the book, that includes characters, and buildings and stuff. So you don't have to changed the beautiful world of ""before I fall"" you've read and you imagined just because the movie doesn't show it like you'd like to.  so letting this go, let's talk about Juliet's way to walk and her hair at Kent's party: Number one,  she didn't walked like an idiot on the book, you know? I mean she was a normal girl but quite. She just used to seem crazy because of what Lindsay says. Number two: why does she have her hair on her face while the party?? I mean ponytail was a really important thing. I can't even describe how disappointed I am.  Let's talk about Rob. I know some of you are here watching the trailer because of these guy Kian and you're fans of him or something like that, well I respect it and I think it's okay. Don't get me wrong I am talking from the place of a girl who has read the book and imagined Rob like a completely different guy. I don't like these guy playing as Rob and I'll never like. Why?.  Well, I love how they were *finally* faithful to the book making him use caps, i was hardly hoping for it. But fact its these guy it's not like book's describe Rob, and also it's not like I did imagined him, And I know no one is in my head and they wouldn't make a movie following my imagination but please, did you really imagined Rob like these guy? Wasn't Rob the hottest boy?. I was hoping for a Colton Haynes *Instead like a little bit taller and skinnier*. SO I KNOW ROB WAS AN ASSHOLLE, BUT JUST LIKE I IMAGINED HIM,  EVERYTIME HE APPEARED I WAS PEEING IN MY PANTS. Not literally, but he was such a hot guy.  So here's Kent, I'm a cold girl who doesn't believe in these of love and all these stuff so don't pretend I like Kent or Kent with Sam because i dont. Anyway I'll leave it all of this, Kent has nothing to do with what the book describes. Okay, Kent had a long hair,  yeah that's right. But he was thinner, taller and with vintage cloths. I don't like him, even I didn't like him already on the book *but that's just because of how I am*.  Lindsay, I don't like her either. I was expecting for a beautiful skinny girl with a short skirt and high heels who takes you breath away when she's stood. I'm sure these girl, I don't know her name, it's beautiful and stuff but she doesn't fit in Lindsay's character. It feels like its not enough.  Besides,  Ellody and Ally are totally different. I was expecting for a Ellody with black hair and little bit fat *Not fat,  but you know, almost. Like she had really big boobs and stuff* and with glasses. Ally, on my opinion because it's not too much describe on the book,  I thought she was like the smaller one with red hair *absolutely NOT like in the movie* But well,  skipping out of how characters look like we have the fact that it's cupid's day and they don't look the same. I mean,  they're not dress up like book's say so and Ally is in the car with Ellody,  Lindsay and Sam,  when she's not suppose to. I don't like it. It wasn't necessary to changed that.  Besides, Sam says ""watch out with the truck"".. What truck? There's no truck in the book *I JUST DONT WANNA GIVE SPOILERS FROM BOOK* . Anyways, you can see Sam running after Juliet, so it's a relief because it's a really important part on book *Juliet it is* And I guess it's already over.  That's it.  I don't know If I forgot something, if I did you can tell me,  if you agree with me you can answer, and if you don't,  you also can. All the answers are welcome in here.  I'm just lead because of book and I got dissapointed but I completely understand if you like it and your excited about it,  I mean I wanna watch it anyways I'm just not that excited and I can see book is far beyond better.  But you can tell me anything, if you agree, if you don't, if I missed a part that doesn't match with book,  you can tell me anything I'll be reading. And, most of all,  thank you for reading!",4,1,agos L,q3Zyy4ZXegE,0.15724769012082446,2017-03-05 04:40:59,False,True

2017-09-05T05:24:47,"OKAY. I need to go on a rant real quick about the difference between the movie and the book. There were quite a few differences between the book and movie, some of which were kind of key to the story:   1) OUTFITS: One of the most important parts is the outfits that the girls wear on Cupid Day: Red Tank Top with a fir trim, and a black skirt. Not that hard to do people.  2)ELODY'S CHARACTER:  In the book she is portrayed as a (not trying to be racist to the character, she did a good job don't get me wrong.) white girl with big breast and a bit of like baby fat with blonde hair. That's, I think, not that hard to find.  3) CHARACTERS/COSTUMES: Some characters were missing. Like Alex, Bridget, and Anna. The whole Alex cheating on Bridget with Anna. Juliet's little sister, who Sam see's when she goes to the restaurant with her parents and little sister. Lauren, the girl in her science class(and the whole her taking the test. not in it). Mr. Otto isn't in it. Neither is the vice principal. Costume wise: the girls who delivered the valograms in the book are dressed up as little ""Valentine"" characters such as an angle, devil, and cupid for example. they are not in the movie. And then there is the freshman girls who Sam hangs out with when she feels like she is edgy. she ends up with them on the day of the fight between her and Lindsey. Forgot that whole part.  4) STORY POINTS: there are little stories that happen each day, some of which did not make it into the movie. one of them being the affair between Mr. Otto and the vice principal. Sam finds out about this one of the days because she was hiding in his office. another one is the Smokers lounge, which ties into Sam and Lindsey not ditching class to go get Fro-Yo, where they see Alex and Anna at a restaurant near the Fro-Yo place. Lindsey not shouting ""SYKES!"" each time that she hits Juliet. And then the whole Kent being her Hero on the second to last night that she lives. That whole thing wasn't in it. (FOR THOSE THAT DIDN'T READ THE BOOK: on the second to last night, she mentions the hero thing to kent, and she tells him that she's gonna need him to be her ""hero"" that night. She takes Elody, Ally, and Lindsey to the party early, and then leaves to take Lindsey's car back to her house, where Kent picks her up.) They also didn't have the day that where she goes in late to school, she is early to Mr. D's class, and they end up making out before the other students come in. ( Don't get me wrong. Glad they didn't have that part.) SENIOR ALLY!!! This was another thing that they were missing. that and the whole ""Do you really want to walk 2.2 miles?""   5) OTHER: Timing. they didn't have Kent and Sam's first kiss right timing wise. Totally wrong place. Another thing timing wise: when Sam wakes up in the morning. In the book: she doesn't wake 24 minutes and 30 seconds or whatever before Lindsey shows up. It's like 5 minutes before or something.  Don't forget the Sam's necklace that she got from her grandmother before she died and before Izzy was born. And on the night when Juliet commits suicide, it's a home phone call that Ally''s mom answers. Not texts to all of them.     So in the end, I was kind of annoyed that a lot of this stuff wasn't in the movie, but it was pretty good. My heart still fluttered when Kent and Sam kissed.

Sam realizes that she has to stop Juliet from dying. However the way she realized did not make any sense. Also it was just too calm for a girl who will hit by a truck later on and die and stop Juliet from dying. It was just too dull when she said ""i love you"" to her parents before leaving the house. Also the dialogues with Kent didn't make any sense as well. Who says that knowing the fact that oneself is going to die soon replacing death with Juliet. The projection of Sam after getting hit by the truck obviously tells us that she is dead. and she says ""you saved me"". It could be an open-ended ending and i just did not like it.. I kind of wished she woke up in the hospital surrounded by the ones she love and movie finishes once she knows the day has been passed. I know it sounds a bit mediocre but it would have been very much satisfying. Also the girl whose role was Lindsay ruined so many scenes. It's like her eyes cannot act at all.

2018-02-17T06:37:27,"Stupid ending made a potentially bare-able film pointless *SPOILER RANT*         Her death at the end of the film made the whole ""save Juliet"" absolutely pointless, I mean Juliet was mentally scared from years of bullying, one good day wasn't going to fix that and now she has the guilt that the only person who was actually trying to help her died because of her. So Juliet will definitely kill her self.

I also loved that girl with the big shirt, Idk what she was called, but she was beautiful. And that guy (I know, I'm bad at remembering names), but he was really cute thought. (Btw. Now we are talking about cute guys, what is the teachers real name? The one with glasses? I have seen her before, ugh..  Anyway, I really hoped she would live but then again, nah, not every movie have to have a happy ending. 10/10!
