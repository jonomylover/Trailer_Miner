Ensuing fantasy-action with mild horror elements and mediocre cgi monsters. The evil is defeated. All go home. Yawwwwwn. God I'm so bored of the same old action movies.

2015-10-28T23:17:50,"Just went to see it. I thought it was decent but do have some thoughts on it. SPOILER WARNING :P I really think this movie should have just had a bad ending. Like, how the fuck does a mere human with a stupid sword win a 1 on 1 fight against the strongest witch of them all? He has no superpowers, she has superpowers! Him winning that is completely impossible, so he should have just lost, died, the witch queen wins, end of story. Or, if they desperately wanted at least a somewhat happy ending, the writers could have had Chloe form a resistance of good witches like herself to overthrow the evil queen or something, and then end it. OR, the witch queen, and witches in general, should have just been made much less powerful, for instance need more time to set up spells and shit, so a human could stand a chance against them. As it is, it's just so stupid that a weak ass human can kill an ultra powerful witch, with a SWORD of all weapons. Not only that, he actually took a couple of bullets before beating her too. Unbelievable. Kind of reminds me of Transcendence, that movie should have had a ""bad"" ending too. For almost the same reason, like in that movie you have this godlike sentient supercomputer, and that computer decides that it's best for the universe if it converts all humans to computers, right? So it begins setting it's plan in motion, and then this dumb human comes along, and tells this godlike machine that it's a bad plan to do all that?? And the machine is like ""oh gosh you're right human, I guess I'm not so smart after all!"" Or something? And then to top it all off, it even self destructs. So damn stupid.

Better than some of the crap studios come out with these days and I'm far from a Diesel fan(I'm almost 40- so I'm starting to get cynical and I don't have heroes I look up to).  Definitely has potential this. The ending has set it up nicely and the story can continue on in the present or the future and in various time-periods, seeing as our hero can't die ;) - from Post-Apocalyptia to a Techno-fueled future. He's not supposed to save civilization, remember- he's just there to make sure humanity lives on.  From zombie-bashing with a twist and Hexen, to Riddick-levels of insanity.

Why..I still love them but it's like someone threatened them and they were like, 'well, it's either this or porn so..'. I don't know...that's just how it felt for me.

2020-04-17T00:09:49,"Witchcraft in the 21rst century? Secret covens practicing the black arts to effect change for baneful work, hexes for revenge or for gain, intent on unleashing a black plague on the world.   The movie starts with a legion of witch hunters from the middle ages to battle evil spirits and their minions, Vin Diesel (Kaulder) is the master witch hunter. Kaulder discovers a witches lair with a large hideous tree of death, and tracks and destroys the queen of witches who places a hex on him, that he shall become immortal to carry on the fight.  One witch Chole (Rose Leslie of Game of Thrones) joins Kaulder and runs a Memory Bar, she can enter people‚Äôs dreams with visions to distract them. Kaulder is attended by faithful priests called the Dolans; Michael Caine and Elijah Wood. There‚Äôs also Belial (Olafur Darri Olafsson), an evil warlock and opponent who serves the Witch Queen.  Kaulder isn't just hunting and destroying witches throughout the last 800 hundred years, Kaulder has helped establish a truce and spends time as a Witch Judge, dealing fairly with practitioners of magic and only imprisoning the ones dabbling in the black arts.  Kaulder considers magic as neither a good or evil presence in the world, just something that exists and a force that must be dealt with. With Witchcraft you set your own limitations with your magical concept in which various fields of magical energy exist, your will or consciousness is the fundamental force to move your magic forward.  The magical forces of the world are controlled by nothing more than the will and concentration of the magician as you set your own limits, some for gain and benefit, others for malice or revenge.",0,0,Mike Edelstein,xsuG2JUgs_8,0.09285714285714283,2020-04-17 00:09:49,False,False
2020-04-19T15:52:43,"***spoiler-ama*** DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THIS MOVIE!!!   ****It‚Äôs frustrating because in the trailer Chloe kisses Kaulder but it‚Äôs not in the movie... and you know it must‚Äôve been shot for the cave scene at the end...and actually would‚Äôve been perfect for that scene and would‚Äôve really validated her plea for him not to end his mortality. She said ‚Äúwe need you‚Äù and that didn‚Äôt sway him but when she said ‚ÄúI need you‚Äú he put down his sword‚Äî indicating that her personal plea was persuading him to continue the fight... but he didn‚Äôt even look up at her and have some sort of iContact or connection to really let that statement sink in and show that he was moved by her statement which he obviously was because he put his sword down. That scene would‚Äôve been strengthened by immediate eye contact after her statement and really needed something more to it to really make it sell as a reason why he would stick around after eight hundred years of loneliness and fighting. Her awesomely awkward hand-comforting gesture is so sweet‚Äî since you consider that she ran away as a teenager and probably keeps everyone at a distance because she‚Äôs terrified of hurting people with her ‚Äògift‚Äô so she‚Äôs never let people close ‚Äîit would‚Äôve been ideal if the ‚ÄúI need you‚Äù was followed by his immediate raised head and eye contact, with surprise on his face...then the hand shot had  been followed by that kiss that was shown in the trailer ...and then segue right into that sassy comment about ‚Äúbesides you still owe me $50,000‚Äú with a grin‚Ä¶",0,0,Crystal Beder,xsuG2JUgs_8,0.144973544973545,2020-04-19 15:52:43,False,False
