If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.1 John 2:15 KJV. Do you love the world? Do you love drugs? Do you love lust and pornography? God says do not be conformed of this world!~be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God-Romans 12:2 KJV Jesus can transform your mind from the inside out and make you a new person if you submit your life to him. The word says the world will hate you if you are not of it. If you are with God it will hate you! But if you are with God who can be against you?~ If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. John 15:19 KJV. *WE IN THE END TIMES* *SOUNDS A LOT LIKE TODAY* ü§î This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 2 Timothy 3:1 KJV For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 2 Timothy 3:2 KJV Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 2 Timothy 3:3 KJV Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 2 Timothy 3:4 KJV Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 2 Timothy 3:5 KJV For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 2 Timothy 3:6 KJV Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 2 Timothy 3:7 KJV Turn to Jesus Christ of Nazareth and turn away from sin, it is hard and we do stray away but after accepting Jesus work hard to walk with him and be in his likeness so you can spend eternity in the new Jerusalem (heaven). We dont go to it he brings it down to us, stray away from the evil that satan's army puts into our minds everyday through Tel-lies-vision and the false idol celebrities of today that openly worship Lucifer for wealth and fame~ For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God-Luke 18:25. THis world is full of evil but also of Jesus Christ mercy, he was persecuted and crucified for our sins we will also go through persecution for following~Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his Lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. John 15:20 KJV.

It requires an ACTIVE pursuit to have a personal relationship with Him. God (through Jesus Christ) desires your trust in Him so that He may lead you and guide you throughout your whole life on earth and also prepare you for the glorious and wonderful day when you receive your great reward in Heaven. Jesus Christ loves you so much. You are so precious in His sight. You were created out of pure love and with a purpose.                             He so eagerly wants you to come to the realization of just how special you are. He truly does. So make today your starting point with our loving Creator that will last forever. Acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord. Welcome Abba YHWH (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit!

According to what I read, the directors, Benny and Josh Safdie, initially wrote this back in 2009, and did try to get Sandler back in 2012, but he initially turned it down. They also did not have the funding necessary for the film. Around that time, they were contacted by Robert Pattison, who wanted to work with them just based off the intriguing poster of their film ""Heaven Knows What"". After they met Pattison, they came up with Good Time just for him. After that success of the film, they were approached with numerous film offers, including a big-budget superhero flick, but turned them all down and got funding for this instead.

You also seem to forget that we all fell in love with him because of his sillier movies, oh wow you aged like 7 years now it's all trash to you huh?  Just because you dislike something or dont get it doesnt make something trash bc somebody out there is going to be affected by the art.   AND LAST you all cant even see how brave and respectable Adam is for accepting roles from almost anyone no matter what people have to say about him! When he takes a role from a low budget film  it's not because he has to its because hes helping out people who maybe haven't been able to get such a big name in one of their films. It's so much deeper than it appears but yet he gets clowned so heavily for his works if every single film isnt exactly what you want.  I apologize for my bad grammar and English but i just had to put this out their for all you ignoramuses who dont know how to respect a legend who we DONT EVEN KNOW HOW LONG HE HAS LEFT ON THIS EARTH BUT ITLL NEVER BE ENOUGH.

Keep hold of your knob until a being appears as pure as you appear to be......The title itself is a piece of little masonic psychological headfuckery. Keep your knob for't goldenchild man. I would say the Freemasons are probably guilty of traumatising an entire planet of humans at this point. (They are also free of the constraints of time and space with their technology so us poor ordinary mortals just have to put up with their strategies) They had to invent Hitler so they could have a glorified persecution complex. I don't know - check out someone like Dr James Giordano to see how the illicit world of brain attack technology can create a world of sub humans. But hey, they have all the technology so you're not allowed to criticise them. This is another piece of tacky ultraviolence and reeling off the usual devil and his whore cod revelations churning out the bible for the movie industry over and over ad nauseam. Goodbye world of gentle comedy, bring on the world of personal degradation. Masonic abuse starts off the moment you're born with mind control and torture technology. They have ""whore"" and ""devil"" mind control programs to literally control your behaviour until you seem to conform to these tacky little archetypes. ""It's over for you now!"" Seemed like so much fun at the time. It seems like we're escalating into a cliched gridlock of psychological global mind control. The basic problem now is the human race is totally in debt to all the governments of the world it continues to pay for to the tune of trillions until some kind of transparency occurs. We're all slaves to these tacky little archetypes, it's so reductive and mentally miserable I can't believe its happened. . Cos all the governments are Masonic run in every country, and all these actors are Freemasons. It doesn't mean I want to do what Hitler seemed to do to the Freemasons though. (Kill the fuckers he screamed madly to crowds of adoring fans) When the world finds out just how insane these mind control programs have been, and that the Freemasons use them on people from birth, then maybe we'll start getting somewhere a bit, what, gentler?! Deactivate your nasty mind control programs guys. That the (masonic) intellectual elite only started talking about brain ethics in 2002, when children were being mind controlled and tortured with remote technology in the 1970s in my lifetime at least, means it's still going to take a while before humans realise it's now easy to mind control an entire planet of beings if you have the technology. We're like a joke planet to the aliens who mind control us into imbecility. Why do I bother saying any of this, it's obvious...‚Ä¶.we know this man, shut up man. Difficult stuff to comprehend, but its certainly happening, you can shove your world of mind control 5G tech where the sun don't shine guys....Donald has been massaging that world with his right hand for a while now...‚Ä¶""averagely"" well i'll probably watch the film and enjoy it in a moment of feeling bored.

2019-12-22T12:56:41,"This movie isn‚Äôt for everyone but personally it was my favorite movie of the year without a doubt. I saw Good Time in high school and it made me wanna make movies, and I‚Äôm currently twenty and in film school. The Safdie‚Äôs are a massive influence on me both in terms of story and visual aesthetic (I shoot all of my films on 35mm or 16mm). My roommates and I drove like two hours (we live in Cambridge MA and the nearest showing was in RI) to see Uncut Gems and we both agreed that it was beyond worth it. My only advice would be that the film is not for mainstream viewers. It sucks but I highly doubt it‚Äôll get any Oscar nods despite receiving a lot of awards buzz because it‚Äôs not an epic by any means. I think most mainstream viewers would find the film really boring because most of the film is the characters interacting and arguing with one another over Adam Sandler‚Äôs character‚Äôs destructive behavior and there‚Äôs not a lot of action beyond that. That‚Äôs not to say the movie is a slow-burn, though, because the execution is everything. The camerawork, tone, and soundtrack make it a really chaotic and anxiety-inducing film and the ending took me completely by surprise. If you‚Äôre someone who isn‚Äôt into Star Wars, Marvel, screwball comedies, or more conventional Oscar fare, I highly recommend this film. Especially if you‚Äôre a cinephile or someone who wants to make movies.

I‚Äôve liked A24 in the past, but this was just too much. The volume is cranked to 10 for most of the film and I left with a headache. Great concept of having the things Sandler was interacting with increase in volume with respect to his proximity vs the camera, but some things got too loud for too long. The part he‚Äôs thrown into a fountain felt like my ears were in a perpetual explosion. And it was just stressful for the entire ride, which made the sound dynamics even worse feeling. Stress and volume for 2 hours is a long time. I say conceptually, the movies pretty solid, but there‚Äôs too much going on in shouting, and the pacing is awkward as a result. There will be what feels like 10 minutes of shouting for little payoff for the verbosity and cursing involved. Exposition in natural increments was pretty great. Loved that it slowly revealed how in deep Sandler was. I‚Äôd give it a 2/10, my SO a straight up zero. I liked the grit, but it felt like it was trying to be hard to like. The style of exposition is really the only merits I can give this film.

I feel bad for Adam Sandler this is a career defining performance for him but he is going to have a tough time winning a best actor oscar in the same category as Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and Adam Driver in Marriage Story. Sandler got snubbed at the Golden Globes with no nomination. This movie is like the polar opposite of Matthew McConaughey‚Äôs Dallas Buyer‚Äôs Club but in a good way. Sandler gained weight like pure fat for his role as a middle age Jewish Jeweler who is also a gambling addict. There is even a scene with a bathroom scale where he clearly informs the audience of it.

2020-02-01T06:00:11,"Interesting how so many fans of this show are comparing it against the Joker when the plots were so different.  Even more interesting how the character of the Joker was so much stronger to go through such a life, than how Howard Ratner lies, cheats and endangers the lives of everyone around him all for money. A very common and predictable fast action movie plot with some great intense, on the edge of your seat scenes, especially the ending.  Both actors did a great job, but definitely can't compare how much more in depth and complicated the Joker's character was. Seems the Joker made many people uncomfortable bc it was based on the problems with mental health. Yet mental health issues effect anyone with a brain. And I think making people uncomfortable is what the show was trying to achieve.  The characters of a macho action thriller like this movie, even if the top of the line action movie, don't even compare to the character of the Joker if given proper attention which many again, are too uncomfortable to do. Good acting does not always go together with what some people think is a good or bad movie.  In fact most movies that had record budgets and brought the masses rarely ever won an Oscar or Golden Globe award for good reason; usually from a lack of written depth of character. It was definitely nice to see Adam Sandler play a more serious character for a change and he did get some justifiable award talk, but it was not comparable to the deep, complicated and uncomfortable character Joaquin Phoenix's plays as the Joker. The movie Rain Man was a 1988 movie and it also was about mental health that won many awards.  However it had more comedy to make people feel more comfortable watching. Funny how comfort, or fun. or excitement makes us believe a movie is better but in fact it's just a more enjoyable feeling it brings; very different than quality.",0,0,CONFIDENT K9S,vTfJp2Ts9X8,0.17412121212121215,2020-02-01 06:00:11,False,True

Me knowing how these films end, gave me satisfaction when I witnessed those around stressed and disoriented by this harsh take on reality. The reaction of those around me was actually worth it, though it really is a lot to process and endure yet you get used to it. I believe there‚Äôs more moral teachings that you can get out of it than any other factor of entertainment but that‚Äôs if you are the type to immerse yourself in these films if you don‚Äôt waste energy it makes sense if you cared less.  Ultimately this was a perfect character study and if anyone needed this role when it comes to the eyes of the audience it was Adam Sandler so that goes hand and hand, it was so hard not to condemn the film after seeing it though i didn‚Äôt feel hatred or stress, I felt it might be the necessary action but after a while even that thought went oblivious and I guess I accepted my fondness for it because after I left the theatre I kept wanting more as if it was a form of dopamine that made me appreciate it more so. I truly believe it will age like wine, the longer it‚Äôs out the the more I wanted partake into that problematic scenario again. Enough of me the Safdie‚Äôs are Geniuses everyone know already my bad to even mention any of this or  Good Times even, Despite the fact that they Should have received at least single ounce of recognition, no respect in the industry to be overlooking films like this even though they captivated the audience, the Safdies deserved more unfortunately there‚Äôs no award for underdogs. Never mind these events, There were a lot of good films out this year an Oscar was unlikely but this should have received a nomination at the very least. I know They had our nominations and in the way they still do have ours, realistically that holds more worth then a sentiment of a trophy, the price will  show valuable in onward time.

Seen it in person my got shot twice in the face in the exact spot came out behind his ear blew his teeth out he got shot on the other side while he was on the ground. Didn't kill him didn't even go to the hospital till the next day or something I don't know, my uncle had a bar on the north side of Milwaukee back then I took him there gave him a beer and it squirted out the holes in his face and head. That was the first time because of the sting of the alcohol that he actually showed pain?? Yeah he was a tough mafucka. Bottom line the guy who shot Sam there was taller he put it to his face so it's a little downward trajectory and it's right through the cheek under the eye that's probably going to come out behind the ear somewhere take some teeth with it. Bottom line he's not dead. Actually there's like three minutes left I should watch that but I think it's just the end credits??
