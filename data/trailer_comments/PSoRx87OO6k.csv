While the first lunar landing mission gets most of the press,  Apollo 8 was the first time man travelled away from the earth, escaped gravity, and traveled  to another world in deep space. The risks were higher than any other mission. The saturn V had only ever been all-up tested twice before, and the last test was a partial failure. They went to the moon on a rocket with only two tests flight previously and none of those test flights included TLI (trans lunar injection) or going to the moon. The command module only flew once before in apollo 7. And when they got to the moon, they fired their service module engine and parked themselves in lunar orbit. And to make matters more perilous, they didn't take a lunar module. Had the same thing that happened to apollo 13, happened to apollo 8; the crew would've died. There was no lifeboat on apollo 8. All the procedures and navigation knowledge gained was a major boost to the program. It solved so many unknowns. If not for apollo 8, apollo 11 might not have happened until 1970.

2018-09-29T10:44:32,"Yes, that looks good. Neil was once characterised by a TV interviewer as ""an easy man to talk to but a difficult man to know."" His colleagues liked him and respected him even though they all wanted that First Man On The Moon slot. One of the reasons NASA bosses gave it to Neil was the fact he really didn't. ""The most Neil ever wanted to be known as was as the first 'pilot' to land on the moon,"" as one of them said. (Unlike Buzz who pissed them all off with persistent annoying campaigning to be the first to get out and walk there.)  I'm glad to see 2 emergency situations show up in the trailer because they demonstrate the ice water in his veins: his Gemini mission when a thruster kept on firing, sending them tumbling end over end at an ever-accelerating rate, whereupon Neil fired the retros to send them into re-entry early which he hoped would fix the problem- and it did.  The other example was his crash of The Flying Bedstead- meant to mimic the lunar module with a vertical jet engine yet in far more dangerous earthly wind and gravity. A sudden gust caught and threw it into a very bad angle he was unable to recover from, and he ejected just 2 seconds before it struck the ground and blew up. Even his colleagues marvelled afterwards that he simply reflected ""yeah, that's a tricky machine"" and returned to work at the office that afternoon.   He was a steely-eyed missile man par excellence. I can't help thinking, despite NASA denials, that they did choose Neil in particular to handle the first manned landing because he'd really proven his cool in the face of death, and more than once. He wasn't just the guy who happened to show up on mission 11 in the flight rotation.   It looks like Ryan Gosling's underplayed him nicely and that they haven't over-sentimentalized the thing, which is always a hazard. I like the grim and steely-eyed tone I've seen in this trailer, will hazard a guess that NASA didn't go in and sanitize the script, and shall definitely seek it out in IMAX.",0,0,videowilliams,PSoRx87OO6k,0.07196428571428574,2018-09-29 10:44:32,True,True

2018-10-09T21:02:10,"The film and television industries represent the most effective propaganda machines ever invented. They made this Hollywood film to brainwash another generation into believing in the impossible, that men went to the Moon and back.  The truth is, no one has ever flown a rocket into space or landed on the Moon because rockets cannot work in space.  For many years, NASA has boldly stated, through documentary film and on their official website, that rockets do not require a body of atmospheric pressure to push away from because they fly using Newton's 3rd law premise of 'action-reaction'.   This premise, however, is based on NASA‚Äôs own flawed ‚Äòaction-reaction‚Äô version of the 3rd law and not on Newton's actual 3rd law.  Sorry if I'm bursting space bubbles here but, far from proving a rocket can fly in space, Newton's 3rd law irrefutably proves that a rocket CANNOT fly in space using just 'action-reaction' alone. It is physically impossible and, as such, proves beyond question that space travel is nothing more than an egregious lie perpetuated by NASA since the early 1960's.   This means that neither NASA, SPACEX nor any other 'Space Agency' has ever sent a rocket, manned or otherwise, into space. It's all a fraud. And that can be undeniably proven...  Based on Newton‚Äôs actual 3rd law premise of 'action-reaction', the following video finally and undeniably proves NASA‚Äôs lie by demonstrating precisely why rockets CANNOT possibly work in space... https://youtu.be/FpQ3ynXrG_o  And it cannot be debunked‚Ä¶",0,8,Franky Uk,PSoRx87OO6k,0.125,2018-10-09 21:02:10,False,True

Armstrong was not cocky, and did not have this much confidence in the success of Apollo 11, because there were too many variables and possible modes of failure.   He has said that he felt there was a 1/3 chance of a successful landing and return, a 1/3 chance of safe return but no landing, and a 1/3 chance the crew would die trying, likely he and Aldrin on the surface.  NASA's philosophy during the Apollo years was that ""the man is the one thing that will not fail"".   So while the Apollo crews were always acutely aware of the possibility of failure, they trained and worked and planned and drove themselves so that *they* would not be the component that failed.   These guys were not average, run of the mill pilots, or even run of the mill military pilots.  They would be at the absolute peak of the aviation profession with military experience, test pilot experience, engineering responsibilities, and advanced degrees.  They helped to design the machines they flew.   Even among these men, Armstrong had more experience than most, flying the tricky and dangerous LLTV.

But they didn't show his years as a test pilot, flying off carriers in his 20's, his being shot down in Korea, or nearly being killed on various occasions.  The same goes for the rest of the these guys, and the endless smaller testing steps (Apollo), plus the staggering engineering challenges.

Wait and watch on your TV screen at home. It simple is blah, blah, blah as far as visual effects.           Now the content: ARE YOU KIDDING me? Guess who the hero of this movie is?  You won't believe it. (Unless your a liberal feminist.) The hero of this movie is NOT Niel Armstrong, who is portrayed as a mortal brilliant pilot and scientist, who is a frail human being capable of not being perfect. He is  flawed as a father and parent. At least he is clearly protrayed that way as all fathers and husbands this side of eternity are in reality.                 Yet in contrast, Niel's wife is portrayed as God-like. She is perfect. As I challenged my wife after wasting 3 hours watching this piece of garbage, Niel's wife is never portrayed in any scene throughout the entire movie as anything  but  perfect. Perfect wife.

Were they able to do it manually with only mechanical devices? No. Not possible. Satellite or staying at outer space were possible and probably it was all that Neil Armstrong did. While staying in the outer space, it probably was filmed in the studio and broadcast. And there's Van Allen radiation belt to consider. People die in it. What about now? Of course we can. But why not? Because there's nothing for us. NASA can't throw astronomical funds at an exploration which benefits nothing to nobody. That's why they don't do it. It's just easier to make people believe they already did while they actually haven't. If they put another man on the moon then it means they won't find a flag there. Moon Landing was a trick to win the cold war with Russia that's all there's to it. Please think scientifically. how the hell can a flag be affected by a wind when there is no air. and Why was the quality of the video was so shitty? I don't believe we landed on the moon at 1969.

His home life was showed as a total failure with Armstrong too afraid to even talk to his kids before leaving for the Apollo 11 flight.  Armstrong is seen as lost, not knowing what to do with his life, very unfriendly, in his own little world and a person with a terrible bad attitude.  The scenes of the space crafts (especially the Gemini 8) are filmed as old rust buckets that are dirty, falling apart and poorly built. Case in point; many of the switches in the Gemini 8 cockpit were rusted, paint worn off surfaces, and sound effects for the Gemini 8 that sounded like a 100 year old tug boat about to fall apart.  A very poorly made ridiculous movie that seemed to be produced to belittle NASA and the U.S. Space Program as a broken down program run by idiots who hired an emotionally hurt and depressed test pilot, Neil Armstrong, for a mission that was carried out in piles of space junk.  The producers went out of their way to include scene after scene of Armstrong sitting in the dark, depressed, trying to figure life out, not having any clear goals in his life.

But in life you should have more than one gear - just sayin. This is closer to 2001 - A Space Odyssey rather than Apollo 13. To be in the shoes of the people surrounded by extremes in both expectation and fallible technology, they overcame insurmountable odds to achieve something that has been dreamt about since we could first look up at the night sky - so basically forever. This is a film of the sacrifices made by the men, women and citizens of a nation who were responsible for getting all of us there.

2019-07-31T05:02:15,Smh... Apollo 13 was a great film. An excellent drama. Well written and well shot. Made you all warm and fuzzy to be an American.  This important propaganda mission during a very uncertain time in American history was an amazing drama to say the least. This was a once in a lifetime world event that not only has never been done again NASA will even admit there are too many things to overcome in order to do this again. Yet our technology today is the difference between horse and buggy and the automobile. This movie was depressing had zero character development the special effects were crap. Acting? Seemed like everyone just got out of bed and really didn't want to be there.  What i think this movie did is hint over and over to the truth. We didn't go to the moon. Few examples movie pointing to this truth: 1. The general mood of the movie about an American hero: noone wants to answer real questions about the validity of the moon expedition and it becomes depressing living a lie. They portray is a hopeless cause even have the astronauts obit ready. Because its impossible. 2. The landing on the moon. They showed the test blowing up. U realize they were traveling upwards of 20k miles per hour to get to moon departed amd landed a legged contraption. (Those are awesome space brakes) They showed them coming in for landing moving like they would need wheels or it it just topple head over head and dead. But then it instantly cut to landed.  3. When neil looks at the earth it is the same photo NASA gave us. The proportion is off. Not slightly where we need mathematical equations or a degree in architectural perspective drawing. Literally its 50x smaller than it should be. The üé• wanted it there the same reason Hollywood has been allowed to show truth for the past few years. The control arm of the government no longer cares what we know or believe.  They know we to passive and complacent to do anything that will disrupt there agenda.
