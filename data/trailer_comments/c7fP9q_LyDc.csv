Then, when they see the woman from the movie (the one who eats the Baby Carrots) eating the Baby Carrots, they simply run, but not so fast, and then they are eaten and then, the Point Grey Pictures Logo draws in, with the same drawing sound from the variation from This is The End and The Interview. I'll find out when of the people in the Logo Community posts the opening logos. Also, I think there will have the Sony/Columbia Pictures logo variant (the one where the Sony logo transitions straight up to the end of the logo) also, I think there's going to be a variant for the Annapurna Pictures logo that matches with the theme of the movie.

It manages to kill itself by jumping out of the cart while the bun, hotdog, and a douche survive. The douche has its freshness seal ripped by the hotdog, swearing revenge on him. He finds rats and befriends them. Meanwhile, the hotdog and bun run into a bagel and lavash, so they travel together. The lost foods try to get back to their aisle and get separated. Hotdog runs into the imperishables, who made up the lie of the Great Beyond. Bun kills a guacamole drug lord in the Mexican aisle. Hotdog finds a cookbook and uses it as evidence that they are being murdered. This prompts everyone into a massive orgy, as their life is meaningless. However, hotdog #2 shows up, having returned from the Great Beyond, as he recounts his tale. He escaped from the bloodbath shown in the trailer and finds a druggie, who gets high, hallucinates the food as they ""really"" are, and passes out. He is killed by a falling axe from his antique weapons collection. This shows 2 that humans can be killed. He returns to the market to tell everyone; they then prep for war. A massive battle occurs, culminating in the douche returning with a rat chariot. They kill every human in the store.

I have high hopes for this film, and though there are those who downgrade this movie based on the sole fact that profanity is abundant in it, I actually set it higher because of that, not because I believe cuss words are the best things ever, but because I can look over the fucking fact that food is actually having an extreme reaction to being fucking consumed in the one place it literally thought would lead it to paradise. And because of the fact that such ""unprofessional"" language in an animated movie is what I've actually been yearning for , so since it has finally been achieved, I've suffered a bit of a biased reaction.

So that's a puppet movie and a rotoscoped movie that probably didn't need to be rotoscoped. Kind've a miserable state of affairs.

2016-05-27T19:22:23,"Some of our food already has emotions, particularly before becoming food.  The scene of the potato being skinned alive while his comrades watch in horror is not unlike an everyday occurrence at a slaughterhouse, though this doesn't seem to be the point.  The very title of the film includes a euphemism for that which was killed against its will in order to be eaten.  The parallels seem obvious, but while interviews and articles comment on some surprising (meaning any) insight into the question of a Higher Power, whether or not the hot dogs will give any thought to the creatures they once were remains to be seen.  It doesn't sound as marketable as dropping F-bombs every 20 seconds, and though the luster from hearing swears tends to wear off after 10 minutes (or by age 15), this film will no doubt make millions, garnering reviews touting its insight while moviegoers laugh and chow down on beef jerky and pork rinds without seeing the irony.",0,0,SCURVY Show,c7fP9q_LyDc,0.17393162393162392,2016-05-27 19:22:23,True,True

It looks like it's gonna rip off Toy Story 3 in the sense that ""inanimate objects that are alive need to escape the hell that they wanted to be in"". Not only that but from what I can tell in the trailer all the humor will be going the ""cursing is funny"" route. And if they're trying to be funny with the ""gore"" (from the food's perspective) I can't really see that as funny. And I'm all for some extreme cartoon violence sometimes, but if that's all that your feature length MOVIE has to offer, just cursing and foodie blood, I don't have much hope for it. If the quality of the movie's visuals is the same as the trailer, everything is gonna have a weird hue of shade to it once they get into the house. I get that it's supposed to set the mood as evil or something, so I'm hoping that effect isn't used for the whole movie in the house. Hopefully.  I still plan to see this though, I just don't see what this movie will have to offer.

The movie is essentially a constant stream of racially charged food clichés mixed with vulgar sexual innuendoes, which combine to make a HORRIBLE movie. The glamorization of bath salt usage, insultingly oversimplified reference to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and weak commentary on faith all fail to add substance to the disgusting barrage of cartoon obscenity.

I entered the movie with the thought of gaining a few laughs, but instead saw traces of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the rise of fascism, and the philosophy of secular humanism. Throughout the movie I kept thinking about Nietzsche's famous quote: ""God is dead,"" and how that played into the food characters trying to kill their Gods (the humans). The notion of ""the great beyond"" stemmed from the natural and innate longing for a better existence. However, in the end, the food characters learned to value their current existence and to not resort to nihilism or religion.
