A black love story that doesn't include black stereotype but is just a love story is rare. Rare like a unicorn siting real. Plus you know the actors, producers and everyone else has to work 10 times harder to even make this movie great. Why do you ask. Because of this lovely thing that we call racism, and to all those I don't see color or racism doesn't exist people. News flash it does. So by calling it just another love story is ignoring all the hard work and shit that they all had to go through to make it. Calling it a black love story movie does not take away from the movie, but instead it lets us know where this movie is coming from, all the hard work that went into it.
