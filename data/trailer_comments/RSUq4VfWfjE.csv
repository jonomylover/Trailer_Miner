But who is. Only 4-5 women in American history have ever been that hot.  I think the moment for Charles Angels has passed. Charlie's Angels was 3 perfect 10's, if you believe there is such a thing, on TV at a time when people just could not see that kind of beauty every day. Most people didn't have cable TV, there was no internet, and VCR's hadn't been invented. There were three 3 big TV networks. There was very little bandwidth for images to be broadcast. If you saw something you liked like you had to wait a while week for it to come back around again. Against that backdrop, Charlie's Angels showed America 3 perfect 10's to men who, not only had never seen a woman that beautiful in reality, had no way to even see a picture of a woman that beautiful.  These days seeing beautiful pictures of beautiful women is commonplace; such images are disposable.",0,2,Darrius Cole,RSUq4VfWfjE,0.3681547619047619,2019-06-27 20:02:00,True,True

The McG films arguably devolved into camp, as if the idea of competent female private eyes were something that couldn't be played straight. This new film also seems to be toning down the most common criticism of the entire franchise, namely that it's nothing more than ""Jiggle TV"" for the male gaze. It's still there somewhat (especially with Kristen Stewart), but it's not on the level of Cameron Diaz dancing in her underwear.

You made Bosely a women? I really hope Charley was left alone. Look, as a women I appreciate the head nod towards feminism but is it just me or does this whole GO GIRLS thing seem to be extra to the point it beats you over the head with a bat? Not only that but recently I've noticed only remakes of my cherished shows/movies and not a single one was worthy of praise. Have we run out of ideas so soon? Leave the shows alone and create something new this is embarrassing. And for any offended individuals note that I personally think this was targeted towards me the audience. Women who watched and loved charles angels, i mean just look at the description, it shouts feminism. My last thought is this okay, EVERYONE please if you are going to create a movie filled with positivity and politics and blah can we be a little more subtle? Can we show women being independent and not say it in the script? Can we get girls with different attitudes DANG shy girls who are housewives who still show feminism? I'm just saying.

Perhaps it could be a musical.   One of the numbers could be called ""Smaller Pants,"" and two different versions could both open and close the production.  In the beginning, Jared sings ""I wanna get in smaller pants,"" in reference to his desire to lose weight by eating only veggie subs.  At the end prior to his arrest, as he's flying around the country molesting children, he could sing the same line, but it would of course have a far more sinister meaning.   Another number could involve a couple of parents going to the authorities to report that their pre-adolescent son has been victimized by Fogle.  The song could be titled ""He Went to Jared.""   You see, I'm a dead ringer for Fogle.   We're talking ""separated at birth"" identical.   Up until November, 2015 I had a fairly steady part time gig posing as him and entertaining at kids' birthday parties.  For a reasonable fee, I'd provide the entertainment (balloon animals and showing the kids the former pants with a 48 inch waistline that ""Jared"" used to have to wear before he started eating Subway veggies subs everyday) and the food (a Subway platter). Needless to say, my tax returns for the past few years have shown a fairly significant reduction in income. My last gig was just after Thanksgiving in 2015. The people who had booked me had paid a deposit in advance, so they went ahead and had me come out with my balloons and five foot cold cut with six toppings on  Italian herb bread.

I also love Elizabeth Banks, and Patrick Stewart too! And though I don't know Ella Balinska , I love her accent, she's British, of course so is Naomi Scott, but they aren't allowing her to use her accent apparently, I guess every American made movie has to have mostly American characters in it! I maybe can understand with this though,  a bit! What bugs me is when they do a movie set in the future in space and everyone is American, I mean when its supposed to be that these people are the last people alive from earth, they act like only Americans survived! Unless the idea is the US were selfish and didn't even try to save people from other parts of the world, that doesn't seem right!  Of course usually when American made movies do have British characters, 9 out of 10 times, there the bad people/the villain in the movies! Like all the Resident Evil movies!  Makes you wonder what does Hollywood have against the British, the have been our allies for at least a couple of hundred years or more!  I guess some people can't get past the Boston Tea Party times or something!

A scene of action is much more exciting and fun when you can see the face of the actress, for the millions she wins could do as Carrie Anne Moss and Charlize Theron. Not showing the face makes it obvious to be a stunt double. Previous versions had problems trying to resemble the Matrix and having many flight scenes, they should have explored more the potential of the actresses as martial artists already they were able to act that if they were true martial artists, mainly Lucy Liu.

Your primary audience here is male, but the music targets the opposite.     I have no problem with the Angels being strong women.  They've always been strong in every incarnation of the IP, and made villain male characters look dumb, so there wasn't a bad female image of the characters to react to, but it seems like the tone of the trailer seeks to make them even stronger, which is fine but not wholly necessary and again could be off-putting to male ticket buyers.",0,0,Sean Grant #stormpinball,RSUq4VfWfjE,0.09563492063492061,2019-07-11 14:28:07,True,True

Perhaps it could be a musical.   One of the numbers could be called ""Smaller Pants,"" and two different versions could both open and close the production.  In the beginning, Jared sings ""I wanna get in smaller pants,"" in reference to his desire to lose weight by eating only veggie subs.  At the end prior to his arrest, as he's flying around the country molesting children, he could sing the same line, but it would of course have a far more sinister meaning.   Another number could involve a couple of parents going to the authorities to report that their pre-adolescent son has been victimized by Fogle.  The song could be titled ""He Went to Jared.""   You see, I'm a dead ringer for Fogle.   We're talking ""separated at birth"" identical.   Up until November, 2015 I had a fairly steady part time gig posing as him and entertaining at kids' birthday parties.  For a reasonable fee, I'd provide the entertainment (balloon animals and showing the kids the former pants with a 48 inch waistline that ""Jared"" used to have to wear before he started eating Subway veggies subs everyday) and the food (a Subway platter). Needless to say, my tax returns for the past few years have shown a fairly significant reduction in income. My last gig was just after Thanksgiving in 2015. The people who had booked me had paid a deposit in advance, so they went ahead and had me come out with my balloons and five foot cold cut with six toppings on  Italian herb bread.

As a Charlie‚Äôs Angels (original) series fan, making Charles Angels a comedy with women acting like teenage misfits doesn‚Äôt work, it didn‚Äôt work in the first installment with Lucy Lu, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore. Charlie‚Äôs Angels needs to be more like James Bond, Salt, Atomic Blonde, and Halle Berry in John Wick 3. The storyline and tone needs to be slightly dark, and the characters should be far more mysterious. Their handler, Bosley should always be a male, he could even be a gay guy, yet even more dangerous than the Angels since he is tasked with watching over them, but the gender differences adds a complexity to the storyline. The angels should also be in the business of assassinating mutherfuckers...it‚Äôs 2020, it‚Äôs time the Angels evolved!",0,0,PAR PATREQ,RSUq4VfWfjE,0.1244047619047619,2019-10-09 02:30:26,True,True

It's been an ongoing joke for how many YEARS that Hollywood can't come up with anything original   -look at this trailer. There is nothing that is grabbing. It looks like it could be any generic formulaic action movie film   As for men being the reason why it failed: -If Banks thinks men don't want to see female action movies, then why is she rebooting a female action movie?! Obviously the first Charles Angels (which was a female action movie) made enough money to warrant a sequel and this reboot. So clearly her statement is false. And look at Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman.   -And again look at this trailer. Do you think it's geared to men? No. The very first dialogue is a ""women can do anything"" line, they're showing off giant clothes closets, there's a dance scene.

2020-02-12T18:07:28,"Just saw this movie and... it is a rather confusing production. It's like the movie is trying to be something that it isn't. I find the movie kinda slow paced in a way, only to have it mixed up with "" funny "" scenes that feels completely out of place. The action scenes lack punch, it's nothing special. Now, the acting itself is rather ok, none of them are doing bad, but I think the characters could have been written better. They are at times at least, doing the best they can with the little they are given. The plot itself is "" okay "" at best, it is nothing terrific tbh. The music, has a much different pace than the movie itself, making it all feel out of synch. I liked the music, but it did not fit the slow pace of the movie. There is also the confusing bit if one is to view the Angels as grown ups or kids, cause it really goes a bit back and forth, making it a bit hard to take the movie "" seriously "", even though it is obviously a comedy ( with *okay* action - not really ) in it. Then you see the politics as well, entering the scene, not all the time, but now and then, which turns people off right of the bat. The feminism stuff. SJW's. If men do not like this movie cause they are sexists, and on and on and on. Which is a load of BS. Ain't even gonna go into why that is BS, cause it simply is. Had enough of it a long time ago.   I have never really been a fan of Kristen Stewart, but despite this being a movie that falls short, and characters that in reality are very uninteresting, I actually liked her performance in this. I dunno, maybe it is cause I sort of feel she is more capable of acting really good, compared to before? I felt she had sort of, become less stiff, more... vivid, loosened up. And, I like this Kristen a lot more than the old one. I just hope that she gets to do proper movies the time ahead, and without all the SJW nonsense. I never thought I'd say that about Kristen, but... there it is. Call me crazy, but that is how I see it now.   Anyways, I saw this movie for free, and I would not spend any money on buying it or anything.

I don‚Äôt know what the hell they did with each of the characters but they somehow managed to instead of making them more relatable and modern, made them even more boring and progressive which is not what the film should‚Äôve been about. I noticed a common trend with female empowerment movies and that seems to be whenever they try to empower a female character, The rule seems to be they have to stand on the shoulders of men and make them look weak or pathetic or otherwise stupid for them to look really good in return and that simply isn‚Äôt the way you do it...you just write their character more interesting...simple.",0,0,Critical Crocodile,RSUq4VfWfjE,-0.01176470588235294,2020-02-13 13:21:18,False,False

It could've been better if they toned down the feminist agenda. I mean the original movies were definitely aimed for the female but *everybody* loved it. That is why it became cult classic.  On the other hand, it's just the right amount of comedy and drama. The action sequence is okay in my book but the ending is kind of a lackluster.  It is not a great movie but it's not bad..i think it does not deserve the hate that it got. If you want a light hearted movie to watch when you're trying to pass the time I recommend watching this.
