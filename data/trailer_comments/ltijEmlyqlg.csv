I haven't seen ""The Heat"" yet with Sandra Bullock.  This movie is SO GOOD that I bet there will be a ""Spy 2"" movie in the future! This movies is very entertaining. And I just laughed so much. It made me smile to hear so many people laughing in the audience, too. This was the kind of movie I needed to see after having such a rough year.

Despite Melissa McCarthy's skills as an actress, the subject and trailers gave a picture about another cheap, Adam Sandler-styled cheap goofball comedy with lousy humor meant to speak for the lowest common denominator. So I went to see it as another ""brains on a hanger""-experience. But what I encountered: quite intelligent action comedy with some nice satire for spy film cliches, sane amount of feminist message, entertaining action scenes, and most important; extremely clever sitcom and great humor in different kind of forms. Characters are also hilariously sharpened, and both casting and acting performances are such admirable work. Academic level has traditionally overlooked the whole genre of comedy, so I'm not really expecting Spy to achieve any Oscar-nominations.
