If this movie has no relationship to the cartoon and is presumably based on the non-Disney folklore instead, then it has no reason to 'reference' the cartoon by playing the song Reflection except to dupe the less cognitively-inclined who love the cartoon to want to see it.   This also better be PG-13 as that would suit a movie with realistic portrayal of war and violence, otherwise this movie only serves to appease those who wanted Mulan to be more 'serious' while at the same time taming it down to make it child-friendly since it has what should be a non-existent connection to a PG animated film.

2019-12-05T20:42:19,"Okay here is my big problem. The story original and Disney are great, it's symbolic and powerful. But the point of Mulan is that she isn't the most beautiful, she is boyish. It's why she could pass as a soldier. She cuts her hair because that's what warriors did, not because it looked good, she did it to metaphorically cut off her past life.  This makes Mulan look like a frilly girly character even in armour. You can just tell that it's a female, and she would also never let her hair out for dramatic effect. It would show that she is a woman and it's really ineffective in a fight.  Mulan isn't a girly girl, and she isn't defined by beauty standards of her time or ours, she is a warrior. She puts her life at risk for others, not just a pretty face.  For me I honestly hate what they did with her character. I might not be Asian but I know when a story is being ruined by so called ""awareness"". If you think this is epic because it's aware of culture, then you should not be up for other Disney remakes, especially the Little Mermaid that's a DANISH story. If Disney wants to be so hip they should remake Snow White in a way that doesn't make her seem like some 1950 housewife. Or heres a better idea.

2019-12-06T02:55:29,"I like that this is slightly different than the original. The original is undeniably a classic. A remake of it in live action would probably never do it justice. The humor and the comedy (aka Mushu and the songs) really made that movie special. But I think this movie is trying to highlight the gravity of Mulan, which the original animation lacked, thus elevating the emotions of honor and sacrifice and all the things we love about Mulan in the first place. Plus, its not like they are scrapping all of the songs of the old movie (aka when they started playing Reflection, i'm with all of  you guys on the bawling)  I am definitely super excited to see this!

Instead of Fa Mulan, Disney’s adaptation, you have Hua Mulan, from the original tale.  In that tale she had a little sister, but i don’t recall her being blood related, and there was no mushu or grandma or handsome warrior to steal her heart.

Una Geisha multifacetica recluida en su casa, con habilidades marciales interior, Se encuentra varios días recluida, preparando una estrategia personal de guerra y mecanismos de Autodefensas..  Por las noches se da un baño alquimista con componentes de agua marina, flores, sales de Guindas, con toque de vainilla y otro toque de perfume con esencia divina . Ese baño se lo da de madrugada, con una copa  preparada como ouja, postura de equilibrio siete chackras y un viaje Nocturno Astral para consultas diarias con Allah..  Camina por las tardes a ver la ley de sincronicidad impuesta, bastante vulgar hoy, y muy vistosa cuando es natural o prepara por Angélica con ayuda Soviética..  Realiza cada noche una consulta a su Tarot de Marsella, bebé una copa de vino..  La Geisha Ana, divide su tiempo en lectura, oraciones con Suras, comparte sus revelaciones y visiones como denuncias y alertas urgentes..Pinta cuadros, investiga el pasado, presente y futuro.. Se realiza maquillajes Samurái para equilibrar el Karma entre un mundo antiguo Samurái y de Geishas a futuro..  Su historia se cuenta como leyenda antigua en el Jardín Botánico de Torremolinos, donde varias esculturas enseñan de manos Samurái, su rebeldía pasada, su lucha constante por la Justicia Universal e igualdad humana..  En el Parque de la Batería, hay un punto energético del sexto chakra o tercer ojo, si lo visitas una vez en la vida puedes aprovechar su influencia Astral.. En el Parque de la Batería hay un monumento a dos Ángeles caídos de guerra por traición Samurái antigua, Demián y Angélica..  En esta reencarnación han tropezado con la misma piedra, levantándose con más fuerza interior y mejorando su estrategia de Guerra.   La Geisha Ana, posee en sus manos el pozo de los deseos, convierte el agua en agua de manantial divina pura, con conocimientos Esotéricos, revelaciones, y curas de enfermedades emocionales..  La Geisha Ana, pinta cuadros en casa y escribe cuentos, prepara rituales para cada visita de algún caído o perseguido, llamado Hospitium..  La Geisha Ana no está en penitencia al ser humano, esta en penitencia a Allah.. No permite que nadie la toque ni se acerque a su morada, donde reflexiona hasta finalizado su entrenamiento Militar Samurái y evolución Esotérica.. Está de castidad permanente muestras dure en entrenamiento, pueden los invitados al Hospitium dormir en casa, beber de su agua, y comer en su mesa, pero no pueden ni deben dirigirle la palabra, ni mirarla a los ojos..  Convive con Samurái que aprendieron las reglas de convivencia básicas con un Geisha.. Es bombardeada a diario en su casa, por detractores, invasores, falsos clarividentes y falsas Geishas.. Iblis hoy ha dado aire en su misión, computado por tres a partir de mañana..  Nieves es su Tutora, se encarga de sus gestiones y representación judicial y cortés marciales.  Ella tiene una petición oficial por preparación y formación permanente y recuperación del verano de tres meses, renovables a más . Pendiente de resolución por parte del Ayuntamiento de Torremolinos para que Nieves se haga cargo de sus compromisos y Llamados .  Hoy recibió como hace tres noches la visita de su hilo Rosa o Alma gemela según la carta Natal Samurái, llamado Ali, pueden intercambiar opiniones a través de Telepatía pero sin miradas ni acercamientos.. No significa que lleguen a consumar la relación por la dificultad del mundo y la persecución a ambos . Las Geishas nunca se casan, ni los Samurái, mantienen un amor eterno Unido por algún fondo común o compartiendo gastos, tareas, responsabilidades de todo tipo .  En una entrevista Samurái le pregunté al Consejo: Como puedo cortar los hilos rojos atados y quedarme con el mío Rosa.  Respuesta: nunca lo conseguirás, aunque avances..Las Geishas nunca se mezclan con los Samurái, Ali es Samurái.. Te espera un profeta Judío, aunque no pertenezca a esa religión, está unido y ha nacido al Judaísmo..  Tu padrino Samurái  Madrina Samurái: Te vamos a instruir en arte del deber sin mezclarnos,  Sabemos que ésta, es tu Tierra Geisha por as señales del Botánico,  Aquí somos mayoría, sois solo tres Geishas en extinción..( Celia., Jazmín de Arabia y Tú) Aquí no pueden intimidar con Samurái, se mantienen las formas, un diálogo discreto y básico, cuando recibas un obsequio o tu hija, ni sonrisas ni Gracias.. La distancia es la base de una buena convivencia . En las calles y casa, serán unas señoras intocables, si alguien se atreve, lo castraremos en público .sin previo aviso.. Solo Hola y Adiós.

2019-12-06T23:20:23,"Stop asking for Mushu! He's not supposed to be there! Stop asking for Li Shang! He's not supposed to be there either! The ONLY thing Disney's animated version of Mulan has in common with the original source material is that she took up her father's arms to fight in a war(for 10 years straight if I might add). If you all can get over your nostalgia maybe you can actually go and read the original Ballad of Mulan which is over 1500 years old and learn a thing or two.  For one I'm glad that they chose to make it more appealing to Chinese audiences. It's part of our literature and culture, we literally memorize and recite WORD FOR WORD the verses to her Ballad in grade school and middle school! You're all telling me you want a copy and paste of the animated version? Yeah look what happened to Beauty and the Beast I'm sure that'll work out just great! Also on that note lets completely disregard what the dragon represents in Chinese culture (the emperor himself) and make him comedy relief by recasting Eddie Murphey JUST to satisfy your nostalgic whims! A Phoenix is much better fit for her either way, it is a symbol of femininity and grace.  You want a sing-a-long? Go watch Frozen. You want a Disney princess romance? Go watch Tangled.

I hate the mythology being forced into this, because it didn't come up in the original. Leave it to Pixar to make a movie about ancient Chinese mythology. Don't shove extra unnecessary supernatural stuff in an otherwise simple story.  Another thing they missed about what drew people into the classic cartoon version is who Mulan is at her core. The original villain and his army were just an unstoppable force, brutal and vicious. They weren't beaten by Mulan because she was strong and well trained. She beat them because she was clever and used what she had at her disposal to gain the upper hand. She's not as strong as a man, and never could be.

I loved her character and the movie will always be one of my favorites. I was, and still am, so proud to be a Chinese American.  But the original was not hated, but not as loved by my parents in comparison to me. And it wasn’t until much later when I was told that the story is very different from its original history. They weren’t particularly in love with Mushu either, because, truth be told, he is a bit of a culturally offensive character. The original movie was amazing, but it wasn’t accurate.  This live action remake IS more accurate. Yes, there’s a witch, but she’s much more culturally appropriate and appreciative than Mushu is. She’s not being served as comic relief. I think this much more serious take on the movie is much needed: to inform today’s youth of a more realistic and true Mulan and the importance of her story. But also, to give the Chinese American youth a much more accurate role model and someone they physically look like, as the original did for me years ago.  I’m excited for this movie!

Mulan 2020 is not going to be the same as the original. That would've been useless. it is not a ""remake"" it is a ""live action"" portraying the story as it would be in *real life* you may not agree with any of these changes, but how long have you had your degree in filmmaking and directing? The directors know what theyre doing. they are learning from mistakes they made in the past, as Mulan had a few culturally insensitive things in it. And this story tells the struggle of a people who have no power gaining it. Women fighting to get rights. Taking such a strong topic that is still being fought for today, and making it lighthearted like a joke is inappropriate.  Please be open and support the movie.

On one hand the trailer looks awesome and I'm excited to see my favorite Disney film be remade and I can respect the devs wanting to respect the original story and Chinese culture, but on the other hand, Disney marketed this as a remake of the Disney Mulan so I'm disappointed that there will be no Shang or the songs. WHY LEAVE OUT THE SONGS?? I'm not upset about Mushu not being included because as Aladdin taught us, animal/sidekicks don't translate well in live action. Plus I can respect that they wanted to cut him out due to the Chinese hating him. But the other stuff? Like the classic scene where she cuts her hair (by the looks of the trailer, she won't cut it). Will Ling, Yao, Chien Po even be in it?

2019-12-08T14:32:41,"so, when I first heard about mulan having no mushu in it and varying from the „origianl“ movie I was so upset, as it is one of my favourite movies and mushu is my little favourite and I would have loved to see him in the remake BUT!! i had no clue how mulan was taken and changed from the original and how the chinese people were upset about it. I‘m sorry. I‘m glad disney is starting to be more sensitive to the different cultures and original stories. I didnt plan on watching the movie out of sheer spite bc of being so upset, but now I am growing and learning out of my emotions and my privilege. I think the part that makes mulan mulan, is not mushu or everything that mkes me love that movie so much, it‘s her being strong, fierce, loving. I always admired her for her power. I always saw her as a role model and I will continue to do so. I can‘t wait to watch the movie now. also I hope everyone who feels as upset as I did will find the ability and insight to really question your emotions and find out what is upsetting you. and then learning why they changed certain things. I‘m glad they did bc otherwise i would have probably never read into the original story of mulan. I‘m glad I learned and got more educated. also the movie looks fantastic, I‘m so happy I won‘t be missing out.",0,0,nicii179,H3PR1v_5cfc,0.2859661172161172,2019-12-08 14:32:41,True,True

This not an adaptation for Disney's Mulan at all. 1) Mulan has a sister? 2) Who the hell is this witch transforming into a hawk or falcon 3) Grandma jokes not included 4) so no dragon even though dragons are Chinese mythology  5) so magic is a thing will there a be a scene with the ancestors bickering at each other or was magic only thrown in to add a Phoneix for some dumb reason, and a witch.  6)little brother and cricket are out the picture too. 7) even though reflections instrumental is playing in the bg, they are not trying to make this a musical, so I highly doubt she will sing. 8) Conclusion not a live remake of the Disney adaptation but just another new adaptation to the long-told story of Mulan. I love the use of an Asian cast, the Chinese dress attire and makeup, shoot even the weapon design are correct.

The old Disney version was great but not accurate to Chinese cultures or the traditional story. Why would Mulan cut off her hair when Chinese soldiers often had long hair as men anyways??? Mushu the dragon was never apart of the real story and was added by Disney. I am not Chinese either but I am from Asia, please stop commanding excessive, unnecessary changes to the movie if you are not educated on the goal of this film or the traditions of China.

2019-12-24T19:25:37,"This movie looks horrible.      It looks like it has nothing of the original Mulan, it's gonna be some fourth-wave feminist bullshit with hyper action scenes and stupid magic plots. Like at 0:32 are those Huns RUNNING UP THE GREAT WALL? That's so much more cartoony than the Cartoon (Where they used grappling hooks). The original movie didn't need a witch/sorceress, Shan Yu was a big bad boi by himself, it's not like Mulan knew how to use magic and thus needed an antagonist with similar skills so the inclusion of that sorceress is just stupid.   Movies like this should never be made. It does nothing but patronize feminism and present a false image of female superiority. The original Mulan didn't patronize anything, but it was empowering and realistic (As much as a cartoon could be) as she was a woman in a misogynistic environment, forced to cut her hair and wrap her breasts in order to pass as male, and even then failing horribly at training at the beginning to the physical limitations of her gender and upbringing as a woman in Ancient China, both obstacles she got over by determination and relentless training. Even after all this, she was nearly executed by Shang for lying and only spared because she saved his life, quoting ""A life for a life"" before telling her to go home.  When she found out Shan Yu was still alive, everyone... EVERYONE even her own friends ignored her because she was a liar and 'just a woman' At least until Shan Yu actually kidnapped the Emperor.   Anyways, I'm done my rant. But this movie is gonna be garbage.",0,8,Mordred C,H3PR1v_5cfc,-0.02194444444444444,2019-12-24 19:25:37,True,True

Just look at the Lion king, everyone hated it because it was the same storyline but live action! Disney is making it like the *ACTUAL* storyline, which is serious, I think its great becuase its respecting the Chinese culture and Asian culture in general. It will also prove that Disney can make serious live action movies and not just cartoons for kids.   Plus they will get a lot of money because a lot of Asian people will be watching this, Disney respected the Asian culture, now if they are able to get the Asians to watch it, they will gain more respect then they already do. So to all the little kids who wish Mushu and the Cricket was there, just dont because you parents needs a break.   Im not saying I hate the cartoon version of Mulan, it was one of my favorite movies.

Cause looking at it from stand alone it looks amazing, but looking at it from a live action remake it's completely different. Idk how to explain it, I guess what I mean is this just doesn't look like a Disney movie, it doesn't look like something Disney would make. I might actually watch this (even though I don't like live action Disney remakes) only because it doesn't really remind me of the original at all, it looks like a similar but different story and plot. Alot of stuff is different, main characters have been taken out, and it's no longer a musical. It's more realistic which is good, but it's not Disney if that makes sense. I get that that's what they were aiming for though.

And all the American-ized humor that seemed outdated even for the 90s was just awkward. I sure hope the new version is a radical upgrade of the original. Bummed there's no Mushu though.

Main differences: -No Mushu -No lucky Cricket -No singing at all - No Li Shang (Mulan’s love interest)  - New love interest who was Mulans biggest rival and hated her when he thought she was a man, but when it’s revealed she’s a woman, immediately falls in love w her (I don’t rlly like that Li Shang was so much better) -Two daughters, Mulan has a sister -The enemies are not the Huns, it’s this evil witch. So basically, this film was made into a more serious adaptation that is more based on the actual Mulan myth, not Disney’s original. This is a film that would probably  be  rlly popular in Asia, as its a style that is rlly liked there. It is still good, I was just extremely disappointed it wasn’t like the original, but seeing as Disney made both movies, they obviously knew the plot, it’s just they original was a little twist from Disney, and this is more like the original myth.",0,0,just jacey,H3PR1v_5cfc,0.19430465367965372,2020-04-02 16:24:19,True,True

2020-05-26T05:38:13,"I am truly ok with them not including Mushu the Dragon and her husband. I fell like this is more of a movie about female power and a girl trying to protect her family and sacrificing herself for them. She dosnt need love and help, she has herself and her family behind her.  She is a strong, independent woman. I cannot wait for this movie to come out. I am sad about them not having the dragon and the general who becomes her husband in it but I truly do not care anymore. This is just a truly spectacular movie without them anyway!  Who else agrees!   I have just found out the general will be in there but I think he will be more of a teacher then a lover. Commander Tung is played by Donnie Yen!  Which is the same man who played in the IP man!!! 1,2,3,4!!!!!  He so played in other amazing kung fu and overall great chinese movies that are so amazing!!!!! I am absolutely stoked to see him in it, I dont even care anymore about the love in the first Mulan I love how this movie is gonna turn out!!!! And I have looked even more into it and I am so excited about who will be in it, does anyone remember the three funny guys at the training camp ???? The guys that dressed up as ladies in the ending of the movie to lure the bad men out?  Or however they did it. The characters will be in this movie! So that is so exciting and a great surprise! Becuase now there might be a tad bit of comedy with these three bros! I will add more once I find more about this movie becuase I am legit so stoked!!!!! This is probably one of my favorite disney movies other then Pocahontas ao I'm kinda overly excited for it. IMAGINE POCAHONTAS AS A LIVE ACTION!!!! THAT WOULD BE AWESOME Ok so remember the guy who was like the head helper for the emperor??

2020-05-26T20:49:32,"While I understand the reason for leaving out Mushu because the character trivialized Chinese culture, I honestly wouldn’t have cared if they had decided to put him in anyway. China is the same country in which several movie goers and critics lambasted Black Panther ( a movie in which the setting was sub Saharan Africa) for being “Too black” 🤔. Sorry China, you can’t undermine and denigrate black culture then turn around and demand that your own be respected 🤷🏾‍♂️. Also, before anyone comments, I realize that Mulan is an ancient Chinese cultural tale, and Black Panther is a Marvel movie based off of a comic book. With that being said, I still don’t care. It’s all falls under the category of fiction, and Black Panther is still culturally significant for black people.",0,0,Jared Brooks,H3PR1v_5cfc,0.02656250000000001,2020-05-26 20:49:32,True,True

2020-06-08T03:22:05,I also have been looking forward to seeing this movie but when I heard when the date it was moved back to I was really really excited. Because the movie has been moved back to my birthday. I've always been a huge Disney princess fan ever since I was little and Mulan is my numbered third favorite princess of all time.
