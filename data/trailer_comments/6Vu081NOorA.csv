Any more than the ordinary activity of the individual brain you'd just have multiple seizures causing brain stress, brain damage and eventually death. It would also lead to other complications. It wouldn't create any advantage at all. It might do if the activity increase is focused on a certain function of the brain, let's say memory, and only temporarily. But again this has a high chance of damaging the brain cells, even if only used once.

2014-06-29T22:19:43,"Not too long ago, we thought the world was flat and flies sprouted from roadkill and feces. First and foremost, ""we use only 10% of our brains"" is false. This was a claim made 80 years ago in the 1930s and people have been spouting the same outdated information since. If we used only 10% of our brains, we'd be vegetables. We virtually use our entire brain. Different areas are just more active than others at different times for different purposes. As illustrated in functional imaging techniques such as MRIs and PET scans, there's a varying degree of activity among different regions of the brain. In addition to billions of neurons, there are other brain cells(glial cells) continually in use even when we're sleeping. However, past evidence(which is also now proven inaccurate) would suggest that glial cells account for approximately 90% of our brain which could be where the ""10%"" idea came from because neural cell count was what we used as a measure for determining brain activity; at least when speaking of how much of our brain is in use. That aside, this movie looks awesome.  On a side note, our brain could possibly be the greatest evolutionary asset we have. Evolution has already been proven, there's no arguing that. It makes sense that our brain was able to develop at an exponential rate once we learned how to cook food which provided much more nourishment than raw food. Logically speaking, this could attribute to an exponential increase in cognition. And within the short time frame we achieved this in, there's still soo much we don't know about it. Speaking in context of the movie, our brain is a very power hungry organ that requires 20% of our body's blood supply for nourishment. When whatever substance was released into her bloodstream starts to nourish the brain, maybe it amplified or rewired the synaptic structure of her brain, allowing her to develop total control of her body. She could choose which gene sequences she wants to change her hair, or split her hand in two via mitotic cell division. It looked like there was some kinda cross-species genetics infused in the drug with all that eye flashing stuff going on. Who knows where our technology could take us. All living things are just made up of energy on a subatomic structure anyways. Then again, I'm trying to apply real world logic and facts to a science fiction movie. =)  By the way, Lucy is a name given to the skeletal remains of a female Australopithecus afarensis species of the hominid family dating back to have lived approximately 3.2 million years ago. hrmmm....",0,0,tenekalom,6Vu081NOorA,0.07331309041835359,2014-06-29 22:19:43,True,True

2014-08-26T06:26:32,"I think the ""10 percent myth"" was founded on the fact that scientists know only as little as much about our brains. And this movie's argument makes sense. Think of your brain as a rubix cube with each piece of square able to rotate in any direction. When you twist the cube around you use 100 percent of it but each piece of square can rotate a lot more faster from a base of 10 rpm per second to 100 rpm per second depending on who's twisting it around. I think the brain is like that, our neural impulses do occur all the time at almost all parts of the brain but that's not all there is to it. If the brain can speed up that transmission of impulses then that's the time where we can truly ""utilize 100% of our brain"". And I believe it would be terrifyingly astonishing when someone achieves that. The brain's capabilities are unfathomable after all.

And of course, I know there are people who believe it to be true. However, entertainment has universally (no medium is safe) resorted to artist license to make their content seem more interesting. It's not the fault of entertainment, though. It's mostly our fault when we read and watch entertainment, and we actually believe some of the subjects they talk about.   However, the movie just isn't good. The film spews philosophical garbage that seemed more pretentious and faulty rather than enlightening and thought provoking.

And now my suggestion is why we don't take that information about how our brain can works at 100% and bring not here but everywhere. Because the only time who can exist it's NOW, the present moment, we are anywhere and everywhere and It Is and always was and always will be until... unlimite.
